1,Well It Is Pretty Funny...,"I know this guy and I like him as a person, but this album is terrible. It's a cross between country and something you would listen to in an elevator. The lyrics are bad; hilariously bad. For example in ""Shooting Star"": ""We hit it off, there was a spark, held eachother, in the dark"" and in the awful ""White Collar Blues"": ""Won't you make love to yourselves, while I sit here and play my guitar""Don't buy this for any reason, the other guy is on crack."
2,"Good score, less than perfect disc.","I love the CD. However, one of the songs on the cd has never played properly. So, although the songs are witty and enjoyable, the fact that the actual product has a song that won't play and I have to skip irritates me tremendously."
3,More A Broadway Spoof Than Python Tour-de-Force,"It's pretty good, but it seems to me more of a Broadway spoof in the various Trey Parker & Matt Stone gag tradition (e.g. from ""Uncle F*kk**"" through ""Everyone has AIDS!""). I'm a Python fanatic, but I didn't quite get a Pythonesque ""vibe"" although it's pretty good stuff. From the price & sellout status of the show, I doubt I'll ever get to see it until it makes it over to the UK, so at least the soundtrack gives a glimpse of what's going on. It would have been nice to work in more of the standard MP songs and have maybe just two or three Broadway-style spoof songs (instead of 15! :-)"
5,Spamalot,"I did not the stage play, but have heard the music and loved it.Very happy with the CD & play it quite often."
3,Monty Pythons Spamalot: A Funny Musical that won't go to far,"I had the pleasure of seeing Spamalot in it's pre-Broadway engagement in Chicago. It is a very enjoyable production with very creative music. It is not exactly at Monty Python Excellence, but it still very funny with songs like ""The Song that goes like this"" and ""You won't succed on Broadway"" that is quite funny to avid Musical people, and even non-musical people. Others songs like ""Run Away!"" and ""I am not Dead yet"" are not as creative and are played off lines from the movie. I would say it was a CD worth listing to just for the few very creative songs, although you must be well-aqainted with Braodway and the movie to really get the story and the music.Overall an enjoyable CD that is good for a laugh if you are in the right mood."
1,Appalling,"I saw ""Spamalot"" on Broadway recently, and couldn't believe how awful it was (especially given that I'm a long-time Monty Python fan). The easily manipulated audience, desperate to be in on the jokes, laughed and cheered uproariously on cue. Disconcerting and frightening to see how easily manipulated people are. I didn't join in on the laughter. How could I? After all, I'm neither chronologically nor mentally 15. In addition to being singularly unfunny, I found the show to be nihilistic, vulgar, fatuous, mean spirited, and nasty minded. Its only greatness is in how perfectly emblematic it is of our disintegrating culture.In a word: Yecch."
2,Arthur Mythos,"This is the worst rendition of an Arthurian mythos CD I have seen. I wouldn't recommend it, it was boring. The comedic tone really bogs it down."
5,Smile-a-lot,"Spamalot is smilealot. Even if you're not a Monty Python fan, there's plenty here to enjoy."
3,Hamalot!,"Overall, pretty good. I liked the inclusion of various other Python bits (Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, Finland, etc.), but there was an appalling lack of Tim Curry on this album (Um, hello? Rocky Horror, anyone?). Also an over-reliance on songs with lyrics like, ""This is how this song goes,"" or ""Every show has a song like this."" Some more inventive lyrics would have been welcome. (Mr. Idle, meet Mr. Brooks!)Still, pretty good. Buy it for $11 or less & you won't feel taken."
1,Listen once and never listen again,"I saw the show and loved it. I thought the songs were witty and the production numbers were riotously funny. I couldn't wait until the OC was available.Funny, how memory plays tricks on us. When I got the CD I was amazed to realize that the music wasn't as good as a commercial jingle and the lyrics weren't witty at all. I tried listening to it again and couldn't get through it.This is not The Producers. Compared to Eric Idle, Mel Brooks is Rodgers, Hammerstein and Sondheim rolled into one."
2,Shamefully Amatureish,"Eric Idle, don't come back, ever!""Spamalot"" is perhaps the most overrated, overpunned and overwritten Broadway musical since ""Thorougly Moddern Millie"" or ""The Producers."" A little low on wit and a little high on production, the show is ""Forbidden Broadway"" with a big budget.How can someone call this shamefully amaturish score the best Broadway score in years? How can ""The Song that Goes Like This"" and ""You Won't Succeed on Broadway"" go onto become classics? Crtics. And the New York critics, which are mixed about ""Light in the Piazza"" and ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"", easilly two of the best entries on the 2004-2005 season, are not worthe reading. Don't buy this album."
1,Hey you Music Executive Morons!,"I only gave this one star cause I have not heard it. I just came by here on one of my many searches to see if whoever owns the rights to Tim Curry's incredibly smart, wickedly funny, dramatic, rockin' solo albums has finally released them on CD. I see The Best of... CD is going for $180! And it's not even the best of those three killer works on A&M.; Does that tell you something? Is there anyone with clout in the music industry that has a clue? One can always hope. Or maybe buy all the stuff I'd have to buy and figure out how to burn my LP's onto CD.Sigh."
3,Riotous Fun and Surprisingly Catchy!!,"How can anyone not chuckle at most of this score? You can't help yourself, it's so inanely silly, yet some of the music is amazingly melodious and catchy. I found myself humming Always Look On the Bright Side of Life for days after listening to the CD. Totally infectious.David Hyde Pierce performing You Won't Succeed On Broadway (If You Don't Have Any Jews) is completely irreverent, tasteless, and hysterically funny! Too many funny moments to list here. Don't look for high art (or for that matter good taste), take it for what it is, go with it and enjoy it!!"
5,That's no ordianary musical!,Love it! If you are a fan of Monty Python's Holy Grail you will not be disappointed!
5,Really Stupid and Really Wonderful,"Having seen the play, I thought it would be fun to enjoy it again through the CD. As I listened to the lyrics and the music, all I could think of was how stupid it all was, how trite, how silly, how Monty Pythonish. It is so inane it's wonderful. The purest of silliness with a cast worthy of reprising the original movie and then some. They are all terrific, but Ramirez steals the show and deserves all the accolades she is getting."
4,A WONDERFUL ENTERAINING CAST ALBUM,"I just purchased the cast album of Spamalot. Unfortinatly I haven't seen the play, but judging by the cast album it must be a very entertaining musical. I haven't enjoyed a cast album like this in a long time. I've played it over and over and I enjoy it more every time I play it. It's fun, tuneful, and the cast is just wonderful. I guess if you see the play you can actually come out humming songs, especially Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life. Listening to this song, it's like having Jerry Herman back on broadway. I highy recommend this CD."
4,I wish it were the whole soundtrack,I enjoy musicals and this one was fun when we saw it in Denver. This CD captures all the songs nicely. I always wished CDs were available with the whole show's soundtrack and not just the songs.
5,Of Grails and Shrubs....,"As I had recently gone to NY with my Girl Friends and saw Spamalot in all its glory...I knew I had to have a CD of those happy, sing along songs of my own.As I put the CD into my laptop- magic ensued...I was back in the theater, with my pals,( and the nice man from Minnesota who sat next to me).Yes-this recording was wonderful and I have memorized almost all the lyrics, so I can belt them out with the actors-(much to the shock and horror of my husband and five dogs), they tend to run in panic whenever I take a deep breath now.I've installed the album into my ipod so no one in this part of Virginia is safe- I do tend to hum or actually sing the best parts where ever I happen to be.If you've seen Spamalot you must have this rendition-who knows-we may meet up at a local grocery and BOTH be singing""The song that goes like this....."""
5,Captures Show's Spirit and Sauciness,"I bought this CD a week before catching Spamalot live on Broadway, and the catchy melodies and riotous lyrics will have you smiling and singing along in no time. If you can't see the show, you'll still be able to get the gist of the plot and a lot of the jokes. This album can be enjoyed by anyone with a taste for music, humor, and life."
5,MONTY PYTHON,"Monty Python, hands down, is the funniest troupe of comedians I have ever encountered. The Knights of Ni, Killer Rabbits, Coconuts, Witches, and much more wait for you in this album. With songs like His Name is Lancelot, which is a rip-roaring good laugh, to Brave Sir Robin, which is so gory that it is funny, and so funny that it is sick. This is one of the best albums, from one of the best musicals made from the only movie that could make my brother crack a smile or two."
1,Totaly Useless,"This product would work better if it were a rock, then at least I could throw it at the dog and get his attention. The product was completely useless at any distance. I think maybe they were laughing at me under their breath. Yes I read the directions and yes I used it properly, and No it did NOT work, not on any of the 3 dogs it was intended for. (the rock did...no more problems when they see me)"
2,A gamble,"I have read reviews from others saying this thing works. However, for my three small dogs it doesn't do much. I know they can hear something because when I push the button to emit the sound I can see them tilting their heads like they hear something. However, it doesn't stop them when they are barking. I am not even sure they can hear it when they are barking. I am wondering if one of the more expensive sound emitting devices would work better."
1,My neighbor dog loves this stuff,"My neighbor's dog backs days and night and they never even try to shut him off. He was barking tonight so i decided to try this product on him. I tried pushing the button for half a second, a second, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, 10 seconds. Nothing would work. He would just bark before, after and while I would push the button. I was about 15 feet away and pointing the remote straight to him. I would not see a positive effect one way or the other.Either this product does not work or the dog is as stupid as my neighbor."
1,Waste of money,"I used it on 4 different type of dogs, and it only made them angrier. Don't rely on this device for protection. I bought it for my mother, thank god I test it first."
4,IT WORKS!,"Our Wheaten Terriers barked at every squirrel (real or imagined), every person who walked down the street, every dog, cat, rabbit or UPS Truck. We had really come to the conclusion that nothing could stop our dogs from barking. We thought we had tried everything but, in desperation, we tried the Pet Parade Dog Repeller and Training Aid. It was really inexpensive and we figured if it didn't work we wouldn't be out much. OMG! They actually stopped barking! It doesn't appear to cause them any pain but, when we push the button, they stop. Oh, sure, they may continue to whine or growl under their breath, but they stop barking. This does not mean that they will never bark again. They are, after all, terriers, but I would say that the barking has dropped by seventy-five per cent and, at our house, that is a miracle. As in all things relating to dogs, you have to use it consistently and you have to be reasonably close to them. I would highly recommend this product."
3,makes dogs mad,"well it definitely works, however, whether or not it will deter a dog is a 50/50. it actually pissed off the dogs we used it on and cause them to try to snap at us. it didn't repel them so much as make them crazy mad. soooo altho it works idk how effective i'd say it is in keeping dogs away...."
3,Works well on some dogs but not all,"I got this because I have 3 different dogs on all 3 sides of my backyard privacy fence that constantly bark when I go anywhere near the fence. It worked really well on the violent lab on one side, but not so much for the other 2. I think it might depend on the breed of dog and their hearing. The other 2 dogs are mutts, and one is pretty old. The old one is completely immune to it, even when I'm 2 ft away and pointing it right at her face."
2,Dog Repeller,I have tried this dog repeller only a few feet from the dog and nothing happened. The dog did not stop barking. This is the reason why I ordered the dog repeller. My neighbor's dog barks continuously when I am in the yard.
3,This is not what I expected!!!!,"I have a 3 month pit-bull, the dog feels the sound, but doesn't make any reaction to it. Dogs on the road also do not make any action.Not recommended to repel a dog!"
1,Sadly this was a big waste of money!,"Ok I saw the mixed feedback. Figured I would try it out and see for myself...to try and stop our 12 week old puppy from barking nonstop and to correct him from jumping up. I am sad to report it was a waste of money. I know our puppy hears it...he could care less. it doesn't even phase him, he looks at it and doesn't even stop what he is doing. He is a mix of lab and newfoundland...no idea if this matters. Anyhow the previous reviewers that said they can hear it when put up to their ear are correct. you can hear a faint sound. Needless to say, I wouldn't waste your money on this. I am amazed that anyone else is having any luck with this because our puppy isn't even affected by it in the least. My husband said this would be a waste of money and sadly he was right."
3,Dog Repeller,this worked excellent in the beginning but after a week or two the dog became accustomed to the sound and repeller was not as effective
1,none,"This product is a JOKE! does not work at all! I could easily return it, just do not want to deal with hassle of returning product."
1,Does not work,"Red light comes on but dog doesnt even notice anything. For the price I was willing to take the risk, after reading previous reviews about it not working I also saw reviews saying it did. I should have listened to my instinct but there are too many options and I was getting confused. I guess cheap never pays off."
2,Disappointing at Best,"When I considered this product I must admit I had high hopes judging by the reiews I read..I wouldnt have given it any stars at all But it works on 3 of our animals..It does shut one of our many Chihuahuas mouths up, & 2 cats it keeps them from scratching our couch! thats when we see them & can push the button...If your buying this product in high hopes of training your dog to not bark...its a hit & miss..1 dog out of every 10 is sad odds to say the least...we are very bummed this product didnt work for us.."
1,cheap dog repeller don't buy!!!!,Bought this for three small barkers. worked great for a week. Then it died. So sad. What a waste of money!!!Pet Parade Dog Repeller and Training Aid
2,Not sure this is strong enough,"I have been using this item for about a week. The very first time I used it I got both dogs attention quickly because it was unfamiliar. They are not responding to it like I would like since then. In the middle of a barking session they are not even pausing for the sound which I am also saying ""no Bark"" with. My cat however hates the noise and vacates the room everytime."
1,wires disconnected within days,"Well, it worked for a few days, that is it must have made a sound that scared by dog because he would reel back and then stare at it. But after only a few uses, it stopped working. I realized that the wires that attach to the battery had come undone. I was hoping I could just tape the connection back together, but when I tried to remove the battery, the point of connection broke in half. So it became very quickly a useless black box.It was too late to return it"
5,exellent for dog trainers!,it really works but you have to be carefull not to hurt the animals. Some of them are really sensitive!
5,Scares my dogs,"If you are looking for something to intimidate your dogs as a training aid, this thing seems to do just that. They do not seem to be in pain, just afraid of it!"
3,Not what I thought it would be...,"This device works the first few times. However, it seems that after a few uses it loses its shock value and dogs begin to incorporate it into their standard hearing patterns. Not so effective after a few uses."
1,1 Month Only!!!,Item worked great when we first got it. Today tried to use it but light was faint and did not seem to work on dog. Battery was perfect. So I guess since only thirty days I had to send it back means it only last thirty days.
2,It does make a sound.,When I received this I liked the size of the item. I do know it woke up a sleeping cat but nothing other than that. My dogs were not impacted by it at all. I saw one ear perk up so I know they heard it but just paid no attention to it. This would be a better item if you could fine tune the frequency to the animal you are trying to control. Shipping was quick and it was exactly what I ordered but useless to me for dog control.
2,Quit almost immediately,"On the first day of testing some dogs seemed to notice it, others didn't. By the second day out, all dogs paid it no mind at all. Being a service tech, I opened it (easy to do) and found the oscillator did not always kick start and the switch had to be pressed hard to make turn it on (merely clicking it didn't always work.) But even when the oscillator was running (as shown by an oscilloscope connected to the output to the transducer), a small microphone connected to the oscilloscope, 2 inches from the transducer, would only occasionally pick up any output, and that usually quite weak. I think there is something wrong with the transducer. Either that or the dogs in my neighborhood are all deaf. My own dog doesn't even turn his head if I blast him with it only 5 feet away (from behind). After writing this I am going to hunt around for a way to contact Amazon for a replacement or refund."
5,NO BARK!,"THIS PRODUCTS WORKS!!SOMETIMES MY HUGE PUPPY TENDS TO BARK ALOT AT NIGHT. MAYBE 5 MINUTES OR LESS BUT HIS BARKIS EAR PIERCING. I SAT IN MY ROOM WHILE HE IN ANOTHER, PRESSED THE BUTTON AND COMPLETE SILENCE!I ONLY USE THIS WHEN HE BARKS WANTING ATTENTION BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT'S TIME FOR BED FOR HIM AND ME."
2,Works good on some dogs,"I have an aussie/husky mix that barks alot so I bought this on a recommendation and when i was training him and he didn't listen i'd zap him, he noticed it but he just ran away confused. After a while it didn't even affect him. However, I have relatives that have a really small dog, and it works great on her. So it just depends on the dog i think."
4,Pretty Good,"My only complaint is it's a little chunky, but it's very effective. I don't use it so much for repelling dogs, but more to recall my dogs. When my dogs are in a park and get distracted and take off on me, it was very hard to recall them verbally, one click of this thing and they would stop in their tracks, do a 180 and come right back to me, no yelling like a maniac necessary."
2,My dog doesn't really pay much attention,"This might work well as a training aid, but it doesn't even remotely repel my dog or even make her uncomfortable. So I don't hold much hope for the neighbors dogs to go running away scared."
2,Didn't work for me,The 9 volt connections were wide but still fit and the unit does come on...but the dog doesn't care.So I would have to say it doesn't meet expectations. I don't see how you could use this to train.
3,Not used as much as planned,We found that you really have to be pretty immobile and pointing this box at the dog...not very practical for our needs.
1,Total POS,"I can hear it make a noise, my dog does not react at all. Aside from giving my family a good laugh this was a total waste of money and time."
1,Useless product,I am trying to stop a dog next door barking.It has no effect on the dog. (Great Dane)I have found the Dog Repeller to be useless!!
4,Dog repeller & training aid,Effective and easy to use - and it works! I recommended this to family and friends for their own dogs.
1,The dog didn't care,The dog just kept barking at us. It didn't care one bit that we used this device. It's a $10 paperweight.
1,Dog sometimes NOTICES the sound...,"My little pit bull definitely notices a sound when I use this, but it barely gets his attention and definitely doesn't stop him barking. I use it inside, outside, and up-close, and the effect (or lack thereof) is always the same."
3,how often is too much,my dog suddenly stops barking when i press the button.. i just worry that it will eventually hurt his ears. i hope he won't bark much anymore so i stop using this thingie..
2,dog repeller,"This item does not work even with being approx 6 feet from barking dog. We purchased to stop dog barking next door. Did absolutely nothing, had to call the dog warden .Pet Parade Dog Repeller and Training Aid"
1,garbage!,i tried to use it on my neighbor's dogs that they leave barking in the backyard while they're at work. IT DIDN'T WORK! i got right on the fence and pointed point blank at them and IT DIDN'T do anything. these dogs are just poodles. i want my money back!
2,"False advertisement (bought new, received opened)","First off, bought new and received open items. As far as the product working, well I'm not exactly sure. The dog I want to test it on is away for the weekend. I tried it on three cats and I'm getting mixed signals from all of them, so I'm not really sure if the cats are responsive to it. I think the problem with the cats is they are used to being around me, so the love must be too overwhelming for them to be scared off, I really don't know.Now for the story behind the first comment I made. I purchased two based on the reviews I read thinking that I would received two unopened dog repellers. But to my surprise both items had clearly been tampered with, making me wonder do I have non-working dog repellers that others sent back. Shipping was phenominal, but again when you buy something brand new you'd expect it be come to you unopened."
4,Ok no batteries though,I like this i have not tried it out on a dog yet because i havent got mine yet. Good feel robust great for the price and i cant even hear it. The one down side is that it doesn't come with batteries and the batterie it uses is a 9 volt alkaline so not your usual 2 double A's.
3,Stop barking for 1,"I got this for one of my dogs but its not a good idea to use when you have more than one animal, you punish both animals. I ended up getting a shock collar and that works better than this for what I needed. This did work but seemed after a few days the dogs could deal with the noise and would take longer to get them to shut up."
5,Pet Trainer,"This little gadget worked like a charm on my little barker. He no longer barks at movements outside our house, but is permitted to bark when someone comes to the door. He is a much more relaxed pet, not worrying about the outside world. I highly recommend this item. Only had to ""zap"" him 2 times and he got the idea."
4,pleasantly surprised,"I have 2 dogs that seem to bark at everything that moves. I didn't think that this would really work but thought the price was cheap enough that it was worth a try. It definitely has an effect on the dogs. With one, it only took one or two tries and she responded and rarely barks anymore. With the other dog you have to be very close to him for it to work. He is improving but it is taking more work. So all in all a good training device but i think the results will vary depending on the breed."
2,Doesn't work,"So far, this has not repelled any dogs. I have my doubts about it working unless you are right next to the dog."
2,not impressed,"Not very impressed with the product. I wouldn't trust my life with it. Don't like to use it for training as it's too cruel for my dog, and it won't do anything but aggravate an aggressive dog and make him more likely to attack."
2,not what i expected,The product does not work as stated.I feel if could have been a better product.i guess you get what you pay for
1,Does not work,"This unit does not work, the dog simply ignores it. Be advised, don't waste your money on this product.!!!!!!!! Rip off"
3,MEDIUM EFFECTIVE DEVISE.,"Perhaps to be more effective you have to be very close to the dog, Probably to train one but not to repel a unfriendly barking dog."
5,It worked for our 2 dogs!!,"It is amazing! It worked right away. We've been using it for a couple of weeks, although now we really only have to say ""quiet"" and they stop barking. I think this is the key, you have to teach a verbal command at the same time. We would say ""quiet"" after they barked more than a couple of times. If they weren't quiet we would hit the button, lease it and then say quite again. Our 2 little terriers caught on quick, even the older one that has been barking like crazy for years. It even works out in the yard when all the neighborhood dogs are barking."
1,Doesn't work for me,"The dog obviously hears it, because turning it on makes him back away a bit. But it doesn't stop his barking, and he comes right back. Perhaps a good idea in principle, but it needs to be a LOT more powerful than this little toy."
1,waste of money,"When I received the dog repeller I put in a fresh alkaline battery like required, my dog was sleeping on the couch about 4 feet away so I aimed away from him and pressed the button. Not even a ear flicker so I aimed toward his direction with same results. Next day while doing my walk the yapper I bought this for came up to me yapping, I tried it on her with no results at all. The product does nothing. I would recommend this product to no one."
2,Sometimes you get what you pay for,"We have tried several products to train our dog over the last year. The issue I ran into with this product is that I have no way of knowing if it works or not. We decided to use this to correct his behavior of jumping on just about everyone he sees. He would start jumping, I clicked the button; he was not phased at all. But like I said, I do not know if the product does not work, he just didn't care about his ears hurting."
3,It's not as good as I would like it to be,It is about what I expected as the price was excellent and it works but I am not sure it is going to work
1,Didn't work,"I tested this device on my dog. It had no effect at all. My dog is an Australian shepard with lots of hair around the ears. Maybe the device doesn't work on this breed or similar breeds of dogs.I was going to use this device when I jog to deter dog that come after me. But, I don't think I could trust it. I will look for another solution."
1,Move on,"Cheap junk didn't work at all, and I've seen another brand in use at a friends that did work should bought the other brand (bark off)."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,I purchased this obviously to curb my dog's barking. I'd read some of the other reviews and decided to give it a try. I should have listened because this item is crap! Didn't work AT ALL!
1,Dog Repeller,I ordered this product to help when a dog chases me on my bicycle. I don't hear the unit do anything and it seems that dogs don't either. I have tried it up close with different dogs with no results. Waste of money in my case
1,Dont work,After reading the reviews I thought I would get this for my barking dog. Everytime I pointed this at her she barked more. I dont understand how anyone could give it a better rating then 1 star.
1,Doesn't work on Mastiff or Rottie,"I was disappointed because there were so many good things said about this product. I have a well socialized Mastiff and Rottie. I would say they get along 95% of the time but sometimes when we give them attention, they sniff each other and begin to fight. I thought this little device would work but it didn't faze them one bit. I did find something that does work do divert their attention away from fighting. I got a big medal pot top and a metal spoon. When they begin to approach each other like they are going to fight, I bang the spoon on the pot top and they stop in their tracks and totally avoid each other, within a few seconds they forget and all is well in the yard. It even startles me at times but no more fights. No more leadership issues anymore and it's a cheap solution."
3,For small dogs,I got this product because my dog likes to dig around the fence line and get out. My neighbor had told me about this item so I gave it a try. I does work on my small dog. But...It has no effect what so ever on our lab. Have tried using this to make him stop jumping up on people and it does not work. I have noticed that our cats can also hear it. So obviously the smaller the animal the more powerful it is to them. I would definitely recommend if you are trying to train a small dog.
2,Not so good....,"I bought this to try to reduce my 2 yr old dog's incessant barking at neighbors, dogs, cats, etc. He does react to it...he will look my direction when I press the button at a distance. If I get closer (within 5') to try and stop the barking...he will tend to bark AT it. So unless it is used with some other kind of reinforcement...it doesn't work so well.What has worked is a squirt gun...he doesn't like water. Found this out when I turned the hose on him one time. Now I need to find a squirt gun holster...and I'm all set. Showdown at the OK corral."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this item after reading many reviews about how well it worked. Not sure who wrote the reviews (probably an employee of the company who made the product) but the dogs did not respond to it at all!!! I might as well have given them the the command to ""bark"" because they didn't miss a bark and as usual they continued to bark non-stop. It is a total waste of money!!!!!!"
1,Not so good,"After many successes, I finally made a purchase that didn't work out. I bought this item to help with training a puppy. It does not seem to work at all. One time I thought I saw the puppy raise her ears momentarily, but she did not stop what she was doing.Typically she did not seem to even notice when I tried to use this device. Distance, close or far away, did not seem to matter. Tried two different brand new batteries. This made no difference.The product does not work. I've returned it."
1,Didn't phase my dog,"The first time I tried this, I had to press the button several times before my dog even noticed it. And then, he only did so with mild interest. My dog is a Great Dane though, I don't know if it makes a difference, but from what I've read it seems to work well on smaller dogs, and that may mean that smaller animals have more acute hearing. For instance, my cat HATES it. His ears fold back and he runs off. I was really hoping this would work for my big boy, but he really doesn't seem to care."
1,Worthless,"Didn't feel this item was as advertised. Expected it to at least minimize my dogs ""sharp"" tone barking, it didn't. Whenever I triggered it all the dog did was turn her head and continue barking."
3,Worked the first time...,"..and then the puppy got used to it. When he went for our son's leg I said ""NO BITING,"" to our little land shark collie pup (3.5 mo), and held the button. He jumped back like he'd been slapped, and I thought I heard a choir sing hallelujah! But then later, the second time, his reaction was a little less, and then a little less. By the fourth or fifth time, I was checking to see if the battery was dead..No reaction. So, we'll try again tomorrow when it's unexpected, but so far a waste for our extremely stubborn nipper.It does seem to help to give a firm command with the sound, but I don't want to have to tell the dog to stop biting after he's already started. Probably better for barking.Super saver shipping seems to be taking longer and longer."
2,Not too good,This gets the attention of dogs though it is by no means a deterent. If you want to get a dogs attention a loud whistle would be more effective.
4,Yes and No,Yes it works. But it depends a lot on the dog. Some dogs like barking and they're not easy to stop. Some dogs bark out of loneliness or fear at having been left out at night; press the button and they will stop or they will go far away. Maximum range of last type must have been thirty yards and on the other side of a high precast wall. Get the right battery. It makes a difference.
4,I am not a dog trainer,"There is no doubt about that, and this cheap little device has been handy. A word of caution however, is that it simply will not train your dog. I looked up how to get my dog to quit jumping and it works. This little contraption however can be used to reinforce those ideas."
1,Save your money,"Bought this as well as the birdhouse and neither of them worked well for us. We have 3 Weimaraners and a blue tick healer and if they could laugh at me, they would...they were curious about the tone but it was far from a deterrent."
5,Miracle worker,"I have three small dogs and my neighbor has a LARGE dog with a deep bark. This has definately curved my doggies barking at passing people behind the house (there is a walking path). Also, it shuts up the neighbors dog for periods of time as well. My son pointed out he could hear the sound. I can hear it too but barely. The dogs definately hear it."
5,Works Great,"I recently rescued a dog and am trying to re-home her. She's very sweet, but re-homing her has been impossible; when people come to see her she immediately goes into her protective barking/growling mode. I bought this hoping that I could use it to get her attention when people come to the door and teach her to greet new people properly. This works! I couldn't believe it. The first time I used it, she stopped and looked at me and calmed down. My other dog and the cat immediately ran out of the room. I do have to say it seems to be more effective on my other dog and the cat, but it works anyway.Our neighbors also have a very large dog they keep outside all the time that barks day and night, at anything and everything. This works on him, too! I've spent years yelling at this dog, bribing him with treats, and yes, hosing him with water (I feel bad about that one). This is a cheap, easy fix, and it works. Couldn't be more happy with this."
2,Good while it lasted,"My dog definitely knew when I was pushing the button, and it was VERY helpful at getting him to stop some undesirable behaviors. But then after about a week it stopped working: Press the button, no indicator light and no reaction from the dog. Changing the batteries yielded no improvement. I would suggest buying a similar product, but not this one."
2,"Sorry, does not work on all dogs.","DID NOT WORK ON MY COCKER SPANIEL AT ALL!!!!!!! However it did work on my Chihuahua, but I got his thing for only my Spaniel (my Chihuahua is trained), so to me, it's useless. It did not even make a single impression on him. And trust me, his ears are fine. I got so frustrated that I even used it 1 inch from his ear, and absolutely nothing happened! He even tried to chew it! Well the box did say that it worked on most dogs, so I can't be too upset. Make sure that if you get this product, that it comes with a good return policy just in case it does not work on your dog."
2,Not impressed,"Either I have an extremely stubborn dog, or this isn't what it's cracked up to be. I can hear the sound. But I had to try it."
2,Does not really work,Tried this out on a few annoying barking dogs in the neighborhood and it didn't really work. It appeared to have worked on a small yap-happy dog but on subsequent trys I got nothing. Also tried on a very agressive dog who was behind a fence and it appeared to only make him more hostile. It's too bad cause from the previous reviews it sounded like it would work. Really need a larger more expensive unit if you really want to stop incessant barking.
4,"So far, so good","I've only had this product a few weeks, but so far, it's stopped this annoying dog from barking at me when I drive by! The first time I used it, he immediately stopped barking and backed off. The second time, he didn't stop, but by the third time, he not only backed away from the fence, but turned his back to me when I drove by.My hope is to train the dog to not bark when it sees me or my car."
2,it sucks.,"my dog starts barking, and i point at him and he stil barks. sometimes he'll like flinch of look like something happened, he'll stop barking for a good 30 seconds and start again. THIS SUCKS."
2,Effect wears off fast,"I got this to use it on a neighbors barking dog.(And also tested it on my own dogs.)They all reacted initially, but then got used to it very fast.I think the initial surprise is very important.Probably not a consistent and persistent solution to dog barking.However may work well to deter an occasional dog that surprises you on your walk."
1,Recvd something different!!!,Ordered a dog repeller and received a 'no woof - dog training' aid.....I wanted something to scare mutts away when my mom goes on walks...this does not look like the one for the job! very upset and will send this one back.
3,It works for big dog.,"This product work wonderful again big dog barking, with no effect with smaller dogs. You get what you pay for."
3,Works to a degree,Our neighbor's dog is a PITA barking and snapping at the fence all the time. We picked this up as an attempt to deter him and it works sometimes when he is close. Can't say he runs and hides but it gets his attention.
1,DOES NOT WORK,"I certainly am disappointed that I have a ""product"" that doesn't work on my rude neighbors jack russell constant barking. I used it as directed & it had no affect on this breeds aggressive behavior. Now I am out of the money. Oh well, I tried to be nice. I would love to have my money back."
3,OK,"I thought that this product would help with the barking and also help train my Yorkie. It really didn't. He responded the first couple of times from me using it. After that, he just rolled with it. The device would get his attention, but would not retain it long enough to get him to respond. I think this device should be used for protection instead of training. I really don't use it anymore. If you have the time to work with your pet on a day to day basis, this might work for you. But for those who don't have a lot of time on your hands, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Dog could care less,"It did work on the first day we used it. It made the dog stop and look at us. After day one, the dog just ignored it. Even when we placed it next to the dog, the dog kept doing its thing."
2,Dogs did not understand it in abroad,I bought it and took it with me when I go abroad in Summer holiday. I tried many times but no dog understand or hear the whistle in another country.Maybe this should be used for dogs in US :-).It was very cheap and it was on time. Thanks
2,Just made my dog bark more,"My dog reacted to the button a few times, but then he responded by barking and biting at the button. I will use other training methods, that will take more work, but end up more effective."
3,Think my dog actually likes it?,When I tried it out on my Labrador he came towards be waging his tail all happy... My cat will flip out and run though.
2,general service,have used amazon for years now they are asking for information that they have already as though i am a new customer .no help from customer service
2,Pet Parade Dog Repeller and Training Aid,"I purchased 2 products a cheap on and the other is a bit more costly. I dd that to train my dog (and others from the neighborhood... LOL). 2 different of these training aids helps in that the pet does not get use to the constant ultra sound (when misbehaving). The thought goes like this... if we humans can learn to ignore certain sounds... so can the dogs! And when i used only this 1 training aid, my dog DID learn to ignore it (wish i had also opted for the shock collar)."
4,It does work,The Dog Repellent works well within a limited range. I would have preferred to know the range before purchasing the product.
1,Doesn't work,"I bought this because we have neighbors with dogs that bark all night long. I had hoped that we would be able to silence them with this product. After days of using it, we saw no results. It was like the dogs heard nothing at all. Maybe this works for other peoples animals, but for us it didn't help at all. I returned this item and am awaiting a refund. Don't waste your money..."
1,Doesn't work - as in - not functional,"This item has no ON/OFF switch, and as soon as the battery was installed, it made a loud 'pop' which apparently indicated that it blew out the device, since it is not working. Tried a second battery, just to be sure if the first one (fresh package of batteries we bought SPECIFICALLY to use with this) might have been dead, but aside from making the same loud 'pop', the device remained completely dead. There is an LED light on the device, which is apparently supposed to light up to indicate that the device worked when the button is pushed, but it has never lit on any of the occasions when I have pushed the button, and if the device makes any sound, my dogs don't hear it. Most annoying part is that I cannot find the packaging to return it."
1,Didn't work on my dog,"Bought this because my dog barks constantly at everyone and everything. Tried this product, he just looked at me and kept on barking. I could tell that he could hear it, but it wasn't enough to deter him from barking. The button also sticks on it."
1,DO NOT USE ON SMALL DOGS!,"I have toy Poodles who love to bark! I got this device yesterday in the mail, clicked it once and my smallest female has been terrified ever since. She normally is a happy playful little thing and ever since I clicked it once she has been shaking, completely terrified and wimpering. All she is doing is hiding in my bed! My other Poodles reacted with the same effect, just not as severe. HORRID, I just smashed it with my foot and it is in the trash! No WAY will I terrify my kids with the thing. You can't hear the noise it makes but apparently it makes a noise a dog can hear and it is really loud and scarey to them! This thing sucks! I wish Amazon gave me the option for negative stars! DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR SMALL DOGS!"
2,"Does't work, can I return it?","It doesn't work, I would like to return it, but not sure it would be worth sending it back."
1,P.O.S. DO NOT BUY !!!!!!!!,"Let me first by saying that I didn't have ''high hopes'' for this product to begin with when purchasing it. I figured ahhh for $10 bucks what the heck..50/50 shot right??? Bad Move!!! I LOST...This thing does not even work a little bit! In fact I think it works the COMPLETE OPPOSITE and pisses the Dog/s off more that you're pointing it at. That is exactly what happened to me when I tested it. I walk past my neighbor's Killer Dogs everyday which I can NOT stand at all. I thought I had something to make it an ''EVEN'' match..... WRONG !!! I pointed it at these 2 dogs ( German Shepard,Rotweiler) and they basically got ''mader'' and barked louder and got more vicious. This product is a GIMMICK and DOES NOT WORK AT ALL !!!Save your $10 bucks for something useful.I had more fun SMASHING this thing into 1 million pieces, then I did using it ! :)"
3,Worked at first,The product seemed to work at first; but then after a few days the dog no longer noticed it and kept on barking. I finally gave up and am now looking for something else that might get the dog to stop barking. Still haven't found anything yet.
2,Somewhat works,"This seems to somewhat work on some dogs. Some dogs (perhaps older ones) don't seem to hear it or be bothered by it. Some dogs do seem to hear it and are repelled slightly. I haven't found any dog that is ""significantly"" repelled by it. I can say though, that I certainly can't hear anything myself (neither can my wife or child) except the button click when it is activated and de-activated."
1,Doesn't work,"I'm not sure if it's not loud enough, or my dog doesn't care about the noise but it doesn't appear to bother him at all. I can tell it's working because ifyou hold it up to your ear you can hear a really high pitch noise."
1,It does NOT work. At all.,"I got this to teach my dogs not to bark at my neighbor coming and going. Previously owned a different one, the Lentek PD01C Ultra Sonic Dog Off Trainer, and that one WORKED. I got the cheaper one this time, and it was just money down the drain, because I had to buy another Lentek device anyway."
4,Seems to work!,"I have two small yappy dogs next door that were driving me crazy with their yapping everytime I wanted to work in my yard. I tried the bird house dog repellent, but it worked only if they came near the area were the dog house was set up. The hand held one allowed me to activate the sound when I was in my yard and the dogs would follow me down the fence. While it hasn't completely stopped their yapping at me entirely, it has largely curtailed it to the point that I can now enjoy being outside in my own yard.If you have annoying dogs near your home (or in your home), you may want to give this product a try. For the price, it is a good deal."
2,Works but not well enough,"We bought this in hopes of shutting up our neighbor's neglected dogs so we could maybe enjoy our neighborhood again. We were kind of desperate since our complaints to the neighbor have been ignored.When the dogs are barking because they're bored the device works okay. We point it at them and press the button and they go running into their little dog house where they stay quiet for a good 15 minutes.However, when the dogs are barking at something good, say the other neighbor's cat or a squirrel, the device doesn't do anything at all. The dogs will look over at us for a second when we hit the button but then they go right back to barking again.This may work just fine as a training aid for your own dog, but using it on someone else's dogs sure doesn't work."
3,Just okay,"I tried these to see if I could get them to stop barking when needed but out of 4 beagles, it only bothers one, he is terrified when it goes off and the others just stop for a split second. Not loving it."
5,AWESOME!!!!! Works every time!!,"I got this device because we have tried everything (including shock collars that we used the vabration only) to get our 6 dogs to not bark at everything. We have 3 Pomeranians (all between 5-10lbs), a chihuahua (8lbs),a beabull (55lbs) and a hound dog (44lbs). This is the ONLY thing that has worked on all of them. Even my cat scrams when I push the button and say No Barking. I would recommend this product to everyone who has a barking issue with their dogs."
1,Did not work for my annoying neighbor's dog!!,"I am desperate for something to stop my neighbor's dog from barking since they make no effort to. I had tried 2 other units outside and figured maybe this one that I can do myself when it barks would do the trick. It did nothing! I am about 15-20 feet away, point the thing at the dog and it sure does not seem to notice anything! I need something that works!!!!"
5,Peace and quiet,"I love this item, this is the second time I bought this product. It works great to deter our little yappies, most of the time we just have to say ""black box"" and our dogs know to settle down. I got one for a friend, myself and my mom this time, as they to have seen and love the results of the ""black box""."
1,Nice idea- didn't work a lick,"Bought this product to use on dogs that come out after me and my wife on our walks. I was looking forward to seeing if it worked. Last night a yellow lab came out after us and I pushed the button - nothing. It jumped on me and I literally had the darn thing in the dogs ear - nothing, no reaction whatsoever. I should have hit the dog over the head with it, maybe that would have repelled the dog."
2,works but breaks,"I owned this product for about 2 months. Although I never had a confrontation, it appeared to work based on dog and cat reactions when engaged. Two problems, the battery cover would not fit when the battery was installed (I had to secure with tape). It stopped working and assumed it was the battery. It wasn't. It's toast. I plan to buy another but a different brand."
4,If only I could train staff to use it.....,"We bought this product for use in our nursing home, we have 3 residents with dogs that live with them. The pomeranian runs & hides when device sounds. I think it could have worked with the schnauser but I couldn't get my staff to use the device often enough to train him. Then 2 of the 3 devices disappeared from the facility."
1,Useless,"I bought this as a training aid to teach my puppy not to bark at people. He doesn't even pay attention to it. I stood probably 2 feet away and he ignored it. I don't know whether it's simply that he is a puppy and has the attention span of a goldfish or if it really is just a piece of junk. Either way, it didn't work for me."
4,It Works,"I purchased this product because in some of my study sites stray dogs form packs and it becomes difficult to work.This dog repellant produces a sound that makes dogs uncomfortable so they dont hang around the sound as much. It really works well and now the dogs leave me alone.It uses 9V alkaline battery to operate. There is only one concern that might turn into a future problem. The battery location is too narrow. I could hardly place the battery inside. When closed, the battery cap stays a little bumped so I am afraid it might get broken soon.Still a good product for the price."
2,Electronic dog repellant,"It appears that to be effective, the user of this devise must be just a few feet from the animal. Personally, I don't care to get ""thisclose"" to a biting dog. I think carrying a big stick or golf club would work much better."
1,Don't waste your money,"I give it one star because it actually did something, but it didn't do much. Tried it out on several dogs and they looked at it and cocked their heads, but none of the three dogs I tried it on were bothered enough to walk, much less run away. I took the battery out and threw it away after that."
2,Kind of worked... Until it broke,"We had no problems from amazon, like usual. The product was shipped when it was supposed to, and arrived on time. That's the good part. The bad part was the product. When we got it, we tried it as our dog barked, and it quited him down (by making him run into the other room), but as soon as we took our finger off the button, he was back. The very next day, part of the speaker broke and rendered the product useless. We tried to fix it, but there wasn't any way we could, nor would it have been worth it to try."
1,not impressed,Maybe if there were one barking dog and you were right in front of it this gadget would work...but the four snarling beasts next door to me remain unfased. Kind of a waste of time and money. The police coming however did seem to help :)
1,Poor results,goes through too many batteries and results are unpredictable. Works sometimes...then sometimes it doesn't. I don't like changing batteries everytime I use it.
1,Does NOT work at all,Tried using it... the dogs actually thought its a new feeding device for them...so they sat closer to me than ever..this device is a junk and the manufacturer is making lot of money just by selling an led in plastic casing at the cost of $11..
2,Have a back up!,Seems to work only within a few feet of the animal and as a distraction at best. Would not depend upon it for protection.
3,Worked for a couple of weeks,"Worked for my 15 pound pup for a couple of weeks, then it broke. I exchanged it and it doesn't even phase him at all. The range is definitely less than 8 ft."
1,Ineffective,"This device does not seem to work on any dog at any distance. Unfortunately, it took a while to find this out, and by then I was past the return date of the product. Very is disappointing."
5,Worked for me!,"I read all the other reviews and figured I would give it a shot. Two neighbor dogs, one is old and the other is about 4 months old. You can guess which one is the constant nuisance. Anyway, I opened it up, put the battery in and walked outside to try it out. The little dog was approximately 50-60 feet away as I approached my fence. It started towards me as it began to bark pointed the Dog Repeller at it and it immediately stopped barking and turned and ran to the other side of the house. Each time I heard a bark from the other side of the yard 60-70 feet away I'd press the button and it would cease and run for cover. Outstanding! Not only does it not bark at us in the back yard now when we are outside, it stays on the other side of it's yard!My take...It works really well on younger dogs with good hearing. The older dog didn't seem to be effected by it at all, but luckily it worked on the one that barks!"
1,why to buy this?,if you buy this you make a mistake. if you believe that the dog will scare by this product will make the beegest mistake that you ever did.
1,"super bad, it does not work","does not work, they send a complaint by mail saying that no animals repels me replied that it was for training only, if the label says animal repellent.do not buy!"
5,Work awesome,"It works great, is funny to watch the noisy dog of my Neighbor stoping his annoying bark...good job with this interesting device, perfect for training dogs and pretty efective for personal protection against vicious street dogs."
2,Small dogs only,"I would save your money and go another route than this product. My boxer would occasionally give me a quizzical look, then continue what he was doing when I tried this on him. My smaller Yorkie seemed to be more sensitive to it."
4,gets your point across!,"I purchased this device to stop my dog from jumping up on everyone. Most of the time it does work. However, if you get trigger happy, the novelty wears off. My dog does not care for the noise and neither does my neighbor's dog. I have noticed that you have to change the battery quite regularly to keep it working at full capacity. The closer you are to your dog the better it works. For the price, I would totally recommend this product."
2,NOt happy,"I bought this product because I ride my bike for exercise and thought it might help with the dog's chasing me. This did not work for me at all. I used it on my dogs here at home and it worked but only because I was about 2 feet away from them. The range is just not far enough to help me on a bike, and I don't like the idea of letting a dog get that close to me on a bike either, my mistake in purchasing this product with such a limited range."
5,This device saved my sanity,"This is the husband part of this account.My wife bought this device because I was going stark raving insane due to our neighbor's dog. The dog is usually about 5 feet from our bedroom window and barks all day and night, the owner not caring.This device arrived in the mail about a week ago. A few clicks of this device when it barks and it shuts up. It took a few days for the dog to associate bark with the unpleasant noise, however, by the end of the first day the dog's barking was reduced 75% or more. The number of times it starts to bark is down from about 20 a day to, maybe, 5... if that. It takes one to two clicks of the button now to shut it up.This device will not work without consistency. The dog has to associate barking with the noise. Click it only when the dog barks: random punishment will not stop the barking.So far I have been using it through the window screen at a range of 5-10 feet. I do not know if it works at a longer range or through a window."
3,Works sometimes,"Hmmm... even though it works for my Doberman Puppy (she was barking like a maniac to my neighbors when we were in backyard, other side of fence) I am not totally satisfied.If used outdoors or during leash walks, does nothing! I am not so sure if this is some way related to my dog's breed (a Doberman) or the normal outdoor distractions and noise making it impractical and useless. But... giving the low price and mixed results, I would recommended anyway.A final notice or advice. Please do not rely on this kind of tools or negative punishment for dog training. It is not the best method. Always use or try to use positive training, where the desired behavior receives a treat (food or petting) When the desired behavior receives a punishment, like using this tool alone with no positive reinforcement, it is called negative training."
2,Didn't work for me,"I bought this to try and stop my dog from barking every time someone walks past our house. I can tell she hears the noise but it's done nothing to stop the barking, unfortunately. It was inexpensive, so worth a try, but it didn't work for me."
4,Works,"If you are looking for something to get your pets attention, then as the Apple Computer Corporation says ""It just works!""."
1,Waste of Money,Bought this in an attempt to quiet several neighborhood dogs. They don't even react to it in any way from as little as 10 feet away. Total waste of time and money.
2,dog repeller,"this product is cheaply made.doesnt seem to work on all dogs. everytime i go to use mine, the button is stuck down. what do you expect for $9.99"
3,Works... sort of.,"This dog training device didnt work on my neighbors dog, but I think its because the dog is to dumb to quit barking and the neighbors encourage it to bark as we walk between the houses to throw out the trash."
2,dog ignored,"May work for some, but didn't for our aussie/collie mix. Pushed button, she looked at it with head cocked, then ambled on. No response at all when used. Nice idea, but...."
2,Didn't work for me.,"This thing scares our cat half to death if it's activated with 10 feet of it. Cat tears off into another room to hide. However, the extremely annoying dog 20 feet away from our back door is unfazed by this device. Just not powerful enough. Better results by spraying neighbors dog with the garden hose.Overpriced for what it is."
1,Don't spend your money,Useless. I bought this to try and deter my dog from barking so much. I've got a cockapoo and she doesn't respond at all when we push the button.
2,Does not work,"The dog repeller arrived in time. From the various reviews that I've read online, dog repellers may work in some cases and not others. In my case, we have 2 small dogs next door and bark every time we walk into the back yard. So this purchase was for the purpose of quieting them down so that we gain our peace back while in the back yard.I tried this product on the Maltese. When I triggered the ultrasound, she continues barking at me. Whether or not she hears the sound is not relevant as this product did not change her behavior.I think I will continue my quest for a good alternative."
1,Also AUDIBLE to humans,"The annoying neighborhood dogs did flinch when button depressed, but only a couple of times. Packaging states it is ""inaudible to humans"" - this is NOT true. My entire family heard it - and it hurts!! Not sure whether it's defective or just false advertising ... I've contacted the seller for a return."
1,This item is worthless,"I bought this item to help control my dog's barking, that of my neighbor's dogs, and to help control any aggressive dogs we encountered on our walks. This thing didn't work on any of the dogs we tried it on -- absolutely no affect at all. Save your money."
4,Handy to have works pretty good,"Goes threw batteries fast but works well on my poodle, he turns his head and looks at me stopping now when I just pick it up."
4,Seems to have some effect...,"I've been testing it out on the neighbors' barking dogs and on barking dogs throughout the neighborhood. They usually quiet down a little bit unless they are super aggressive. I'm not sure I would trust it to fend off an attacking dog while I'm out walking so I will continue to carry my pepper spray. Besides, the zapper is a little bulky where my pepper spray can be carried on a caribiner on my belt loop. The cat doesn't seem to like it either. It doesn't bother my dog because I gave him treats after pressing the button to make it a positive experience for him."
1,"Great idea, poor execution","The products works after a fashion, but is very limited because of its 6' range."
1,Broke after a week,"Worked for the first few days, got the dog's attention very fast. Stopped working after a week. JUNK."
2,Not the Best,"As I had read in other reviews, the battery back does not still on and I had to tape it. I have 3 small dogs and they seem to respond to the repeller only if they are not too excited. I have a little more peace. If they get too excited, the repeller does not work. Also, if I am in a different room then the dogs, it does not work."
3,Doesn't Work with All Breeds,"I bought this due to all of my neighbor's barking dogs in three different yards around me. It didn't work with the Terrier mixes, but did with the German Shepard. It also works with my own Labradoodle. I think it just depends on the breed. I doubt this would work for joggers or walkers as a "" mean dog repellent"" because you just can't be sure which dogs it will deter and which it won't. For barkers, it's so inexpensive that it's worth trying in my opinion."
4,Really works,First shipment of Dog Repeller had to be returned-battery compartment defective. Return was a breeze and very speedy. Using Dog Repeller as a NO bark aid. Working on a 10 yr old wheaton who has a long barking problem. Also take on walks to deter loose dogs.
1,Doesn't work at all,"I got this item to try and train my dogs to stop barking when friends come over to the house. I don't mind them barking to let me know someone is here but once I know who it is or that there's no danger, I want them to stop. This device did NOTHING for either dog (7 year old lab, 1 year old shepherd). They did seem to hear it as their ears twitched a little, but it wasn't strong enough to really get their attention. I don't think this would work if a pit bull ran up to you, either! Don't waste your money on this."
5,It works!,"Bought it for my son heading out of the country. Dogs are not pets where he is headed. I have tried it on our neighbors dog. He barks constantly I am ready to climb the fence and put a shocker on him. He didn't like it at all. He turned tail and left. While chatting with my sister on the phone, her dogs were barking like crazy. I told her put me on speaker.. I hit the button and all the animals stopped immediately. The cat bolted from the room. lol"
2,Works on some dogs.,I have 2 dogs and I wanted to use this for training them to not jump on our guests or doing other bad things in the house. It works great on my 3yr old and will respond to it by stopping anything she is doing and just look at me. Now my 1 year old....... he could care less about the sound. He just keeps doing his thing like he does not hear anything.
1,Garbage,"My neighbor has an extremely annoying and aggressive pitbull. I have literally had to call animal control because it will escape the fense and I have a 20 month old son. I attempted to talk to the neighbor, but he is unwilling to do anything about it. So, I decided to get this. Well, to my dismay this thing does NOT work AT ALL. I put it up to my ear and can hear the high pitched sound, but the dog has absolutely no response. It just barks and barks and barks. So, I guess it's back to calling animal control every other day. Lame."
1,"It makes a sound, but......","The good news, it does make a sound too faint for most people. I can hear it faintly if I point it towards myself and am about 6 inches from my ear.The bad news it seems to have a range of about 6-10 inches. Took that just to get the cat to move its ears and look at me funny. The dog did nothing. Same with neighbors dogs.Repeller, perhaps if I threw it.I do not like to give negative reviews, but this is a waste of time and money."
2,Not worth it,"I am sorry to say , but this product doesn't work,at all for either of my dogs. I would not suggest this product to anyone. SORRY"
1,Piece of junk,Worked for one day then stopped. I would not recommend its purchase by anyone unless you are giving to an enemy.
3,It is only somewhat effective.,Seems to annoy my dog more than anything. I get almost as good results just pointing it at my dog.
3,Recommendation gone astray,"Like some previous reviews, we have three dogs next door which bark at everything that moves, starting some mornings at 5:30 AM, when I leave for work and sometimes never ending. Two mutts and one blue-tick hound which have not responded to any discussion with their owners or anything else we have tried so decided to try the electronic dog whistle here. It works great on one of the dogs who instantly quiets and runs toward his house but the other two seem impervious. I don't think this frequency works at all on the blue-tick and the other mutt just prances out of range and keeps barking. Oh well, at least I can say I tried another recommendation but have to reiterate that this device will probably not work if your barking dog happens to be a hound."
4,Seems to work better on big dogs. Just annoys small dogs.,"I'm surrounded on all sides by dogs that constantly bark at me when I'm in my yard. This has worked wonders with most dogs, except the small yappers. Dunno what would work on them besides mace."
1,Did not work,"Our dog did not like the sound the first time he heard it, but after that, just ignored it and barked at people like he had before, maybe even more."
1,Fell apart in 1 week,I used this for 1 week only. The gel at the edges where you rest your wrist just went in - kind of punctured. On the 8th day the cover tore and the cushion/gel started coming out. This is of extremely poor quality and mine seemed fake. expected more my Belkin. Amazon however is sending me a replacement. They really have very good customer service.
4,"Very comfortable, but wears out quickly","I love this thing. After trying a fellows gel wrist pad that felt like a rock, this one is perfect for my needs. It is very soft and very comfortable. If I don't have it with me I can start to feel it in my wrists very quickly.The only problem I had was that after about 6 months of use, the cloth cover on it started to come off. It still works fine, but it is annoying and I'm ordering another one."
1,Torn,"We had two, both came apart within two months. Comfortable while they lasted, but surely wouldn't be buying again."
1,fell apart after 2 months,"would be nice if it lasted, but within 2 months, the gel stuff started falling out, the whole thing becoming an ugly blob. I'm going with a different brand next time."
2,Does not last very long,I bought this few months ago and loved it for the first 4 months. Great product but does not last as the top material is wrinkled after only a few months of use and is more of a nuisance than help right now. I guess for the price it will only last you a few months.
4,Nice,I kept getting wrist cramps at work and figured this would help. My wrists still cramp but this does give me more support.
4,Relieves a lot of wrist pressure,"I bought this for my work computer and it really helps out tremendously to relieve pressure on my wrists since I work on a computer all day long. I'm picky about how soft the pads need to be, because if it's a hard foam one, what's the point in even having one? The point is to relieve pressure on the wrists to reduce the risk of carpel tunnel. If you purchase a hard foam wrist pad...it does NO good. You may as well put your wrists on the desk. Using this Belkin Wave is just like putting your wrists on a pillow!"
4,Good arm rests,I didn't get this to use on my keyboard - I got them to rest my arms on at my desk.Other reviews said they smell; mine had a slightly noticeable smell for a day and then didn't anymore.
5,Perfect!,Exactly what I was looking for.It was shipped in an unnecessarily large box.Besides that it is what I expected
5,The reason I don't have carpel tunnel syndrome...,"Gel-filled wrist rests are awesome!I use my PC for about 2-4 hours per day - over the past 15 or so years. I never have any problem with wrist fatigue or pain!Couple this with a gel-filled mouse pad, and you're good to go!"
3,works fine... smells really bad,"I just got this, and it is a fine pad. However, this thing smells like S***!! Its not a random smell it has got that industrial polyester smell, but it is really bad! It gives me a headache just being close. Rinsing it under the sink helps, but it still smells aweful and im going to try the washing machine.Haha i swear to you im not making this up... i just got the belkin mousepad too...same stench!maybe the other brands have this too, but just be warned."
2,Fell apart after less than a year of use,"Update to below: Against my better judgment, I bought a second one of these, thinking that perhaps the first one had been defective. The new one didn't even last a month before it split open and spewed sticky gel gunk all over my keyboard and desk. I won't make the mistake of buying another one, they are poorly made.------Why can't somebody create a gel-filled wrist rest that holds up?I bought the Belkin wrist rest pad to replace my previous one (3M) which had fallen apart. All I do is rest my wrists on it while typing. I don't squeeze it, touch it or abuse it in any other way. Yet in less than a year, the outer covering split open along one of the seams and the inner material started coming out. By the time I realized it, I had gummy gel bits all over the place, including inside my keyboard where they were making keys stick. It took me a couple of hours of unpleasant effort to ""ungunk"" my keyboard.Not recommended."
1,"Cheap price, but cheap made apparently","I bought this item at a retail store primarily because it was similar to a good wrist rest from another brand which I use at work and it was cheaper than most of the others the store had to offer. Being on a budget, price played a large part in the choice. However, within about a week of use, the gel pad inside seemed to have begun to shrink up as the cover became increasingly loose and wrinkled up, too big for what was underneath. I've only been using the item a couple of months and the cloth cover has begun to come loose from the base of the pad. I guess you get what you pay for. *smirk* I definitely do not recommend this item because its construction leaves much to be desired in quality."
5,Great,I have the beginnings of carp atonal syndrome and typing was really starting to kill my wrist and hands and was starting to affect my working. I started using this gel pad and I no longer have any pain in my wrist or my hands.
4,smelly at first...,very comfortable to use but exceedingly odiferous coming out of the plastic sleeve. better after exposed to the air for several days.
1,Fell apart less then 6 months of use,It smelled really bad when I first got it but after awhile the smell when away but after 3 months the fabric started to separate and create bubbles and winkles where you would rest your wrists and now 3 months later the fabric has come off the edges exposing the insides.
4,"Not as awesome as the one for the mouse, but pretty comfy.","This thing does the trick. Wrists less tired. You know, it's pretty good, but it's hard to get excited about. The Innovera Mouse Pad with Gel Wrist Pad is much more exciting. But, it's a different product with a different purpose."
2,Nothing to type home about,"I was pretty disappointed with this one. My coworker had a gel pad for his keyboard that was soft like a cloud for your wrists, which made me go looking for one. Unfortunately I found this one. This was not soft. It's barely even squishy. It takes a great deal of force for it to give at all, making it about as useful as a 2x4. I do not recommend"
1,Total Junk! Won't last more than a year.,"I bought one of these a year ago but recently I've been noticing the stuffing is all over my desktop.The sides are sewn, rather poorly I might add and the gel that is inside spills out like a leaky bean bag chair.Who knows if this stuff is toxic or not.Why not make a solid foam pad that will stand up to normal use?"
5,Gel pad,Gel pad works very well and is very comfortable. Not bulky moves with you as you type and is not hard.
1,Be aware of return policies,I was very disappointed to learn that this product came from another company with another return policy. Not only was the shipping almost 100% cost of the item but then it came damaged and I now have to spend money to return it! I was on the phone with customer service and they would not credit without the damaged item nor offer shipping. I found Computer Brain to be inflexible with this situation and Amazon is completely out of the loop and no help.
1,Strong chemical fumes - avoid this product,"Works fine, but strong toxic-smelling fumes out of the box that only gradually start to fade (but don't go away). I threw mine out as I don't want my family breathing this stuff - getting a 3M for a few more bucks."
3,Carpal Tunnel Goodbye,"This is the best wrist rest.As wrist rests go, this wrist rest must exist as best.It is billed as a ""wave"" wrist rest. As such, the reviewer must defer to the manufacturer's best judgment, because this wrist rest does list (in my case, it lists to the right). I do agree that the odor emitted by the new wrist rest is not te best, but you do get used to it.Should a user get used to the wrist rest smell, though, the user used to the best wrist rest's existing smell is rewarded.So, to sum up, here we have the best right-listing wrist rest that exists."
1,I never even recieved it!,"I ordered this product and never recieved it. THEN, when I called to find out what happened I was given the runaround and I had to call at LEAST 15 time-no exaaggeration. Office Depot told me to call Amazon told me to call Ups told me to call Office Depot and so on.I STILL never recieved my order and I at least got my money back after over a month of bull."
1,Product NOT as described,"I ordered this from Amazon because it states in the product information (dimensions) that the wrist rest is 21"" long. I wanted something long enough for both keyboard and mouse. Unfortunately when I opened the box I found that it is only 18"" long -- 18 1/2"" if you include the edges (where there is no padding). Useless for my needs, waste of money; the old, battered wrist rest I have will still have to serve me as no one makes a decent sized one anymore.This Belkin product is so skinny that it probably wouldn't have been very comfortable anyway.My advice: look elsewhere.One good note, Amazon is giving me a full refund -- only good thing about this whole unfortunate purchase."
2,Too Hard (same problem as the mouse pad),"Same problem as the mouse pad:Sincerely, I've read a number of comments saying this thing is too hard, and as it is not too expensive, I thought I might give it a try. It is definitely much too hard (is it realy gel inside ? It feels more like dense foam or rubber ...)I don't think I will get used to it as the thing is supposed to take the shape of the wrist and not the opposit. In fact, even after half an hour of use, my right wrist is already slowly getting uncomfortable warm and it seems also that the stiffness of that thing increases the friction on the synthetic surface. So I'm already looking for another real wrist rest...And forgot to add: strong chemical plastic smell !"
2,It doesn't hold up to elbow abuse,"I purchased this product to replace my previous gel wrist rest that had finally worn out after many months of use. This pad wasn't as good as I hoped it to be. First, the product did not give off a bad odor when I removed it from the box, as others have stated. But the gel is very firm and not very comfortable. I really wanted it to feel like gel, but instead it feels like a dry sponge. I primarily use wrist rests for my elbow. Within two days, I already had a permanent indentation where my elbow commonly rests. After a month of use, I have permanent places on the rest where it has bottomed out all the way. To be fair, it is a wrist rest, so I guess it isn't designed for elbows. The positives are that the neoprene outside is sturdy and the edges seem to hold well (so far). But if you are looking for a gel rest that feels like soft gel, this isn't the product. I am already looking for a replacement for this one after only a month of use."
3,meh,"i got this since i've been doing a lot more typing for school, but when i got it it seemed already squished and compacted down. there is an indentation in the middle. not sure if its a notch to rest your palms or what?"
3,Good support - a little crunchy,"It provides good support and is a good size, but I was expecting a gel cushion (like those gel bicycle seats). However, it seems to have some gel in it, and then something else to fluff it up, which makes a crunchy sound when you squish it.Also, it wreaked of chemicals for about a week after I took it out of it's packaging - so had to let it air out a bit."
4,Does the job is supposed to do.,"No issues, works great. Mine did not have a strange smell that others reported. My OT suggested I get one of these."
2,Very Poor,"I use a wrist support to protect my arms from rough wood on the edge of my desk. I purchased this based on good results from Belkin products. Unfortunately, this product does not measure up. The foam in the rest collapses as soon as you put any weight on it. I bought a matching mouse pad with wrist rest at the same time. The cushion on the mouse pad works fine."
5,functional,This item does what it's supposed to. It would be better if it had a little more cushion in it because it is a low.
2,"Firm and soft, but...","Wonderful very comfortable wrist rest with a durability problem. You must be careful not to position your elbow on the left side when relaxing or the pressure will eventually cause the seam to open and the gel to escape. The covering fabric is glued down when it should be stitched so it will separate. Otherwise the gel covered foam inside is firm yet soft. How do I know what's inside? Because two of them have torn open so far. Yuck, gooey gel! I think that 2 stars is appropriate. Belkin should use a better glue."
1,bad shape,Why is it shaped so there is little or no support for the right wrist? I would recommend getting something else. This support is just not useful - apparently the person who designed this must type with one hand. If it was not such a hassle to return the item to Amazon I would.
3,smells horrible,"the gel pad works great, and i am very pleased with the comfort it gives.However, the thing smells REALLY bad. its like a burnt rubber and paint combo. I cracked it open and used it for about half an hour and started feeling really sick and got a headache. I highly recommend airing this thing out for a few days or something before you use it. This has to be against some sort of safety or hazardous inspections. this is not your ordinary smell."
4,Belking Wrist Pad,"Upon purchasing a new smoked glass desk, I wanted a wrist pad that would be comfortable and stylish. The satiny finish of this product is smooth to the touch and adds a little shimmer to my work space; as well, it is very comfortable."
4,Nearly perfect,"The Good:It's comfortable, provides support, looks stylish, and is inexpensive.The Not So Good:It could be a little bit wider. It's only around 2 inches wide, which means you might have to adjust your position each time you rest your wrist on it to make sure it's in just the right place.Other than that, no complaints.Overall 4/5. Glad I bought it."
4,Works great.,"The gel wrist pad takes some time to get used to, so don't think it will fit perfect right away. Also, when it first arrives and starts being used, you will notice it smells like chemicals. This goes away, and after a month, it works like a charm. Good item."
1,Toxic,"While not as bad as the newer Belkin mouse pads, these products are also made with a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent, and they off-gas toxic and carcinogenic fumes.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you value your health.Earlier production runs may not have contained the chemicals, but the current production runs do."
2,wave... goodbye,Not sure what the purpose of the wave is. I replaced another old warn out gel wristrest with this one and it does not compare. The right hand sit's in the 'wave' and is not nearly as supported as the left. Depending on if you have a number pad or not etc that wave could really be inthe wrong location. Will resume my search for one more like the one I replaced.
4,"Comfortable, but does have a distinct rubbery smell to it","The wrist pad fit my space just about perfectly, and is very comfortable to use. As noted in another review, the pad does have a strong and distinct rubbery smell to it. The first day that I had the pad it was almost too much. I'm not sure if I'm getting used to it, or if the smell has gone down, but it isn't so bad now."
4,Nice little pop record,"These guys out of Toronto don't get as much attention as bands like The Islands or Arcade Fire, likely due to the fact that pitchfork media and other poser operated outfits aren't lavishing adulatory praise all over them.I first heard this band on the soundtrack of Everything's Gone Green, which was a Douglas Coupland project that, to be honest, wasn't all that great. Anyways, Birdsong and a couple other tunes on here are well worth the cover price. They have a more conventional kind of pop/rock sound that I would normally find nauseating, but they make it work most of the time. The kind of music that would actually fit nicely into a radio station's playlist if they weren't all operated by deadbeat hippy / corporate whores with strict regulations on what crappy bands need to be made popular. Thank God the internet has made radio an anachronism."
5,Excellent--very knowledgeable,"This is an excellent book! I used it in one of my classes in college. It really gives insight into daily details of the lives of the Etruscans, which also helps you to understand the Romans better. Very well written, by good scholars."
4,Worth the read...,"First let me say how much I enjoyed this book. Being interested in the field, I chose the book as a glimpse into the profession before I made any leaps.I think the book takes a good survey of the profession while illustrating some do's and don'ts. I was hoping for a more in-depth analysis, but will have to live without (hence the 4 stars and not 5).If you are looking at this profession for the first time, I would wholeheartedly recommend this book. If you have already done your homework or have started working for a major broker/dealer, then you probably won't sacrafice too much. Of course, that isn't to say you won't get something out of it. I believe this book may have something for you, it just won't be as much.Enjoy."
2,Disappointed,"Just bought the book. I am a CPA and still new to financial planning, but I have been licensed for a while. I still consider myself as a beginner, so I thought this book would be useful. I was very disappointed at the lack of details in the book. I was hoping for more real-life examples, more checklists and templates. If you never have put your toes in the industry, the book might be useful. Might. Otherwise I was very disappointed."
4,Straightforward,So far this is a very easy straightforward read that is written quite well. I haven't gotten through the entire text but it certainly isn't as dry as I had expected. I would definitely recommend this book based on what I've read so far.
1,This book is scam,This book is a scam. He's trying to get people to sign up for his training program.The actual information in the book is minimally helpful.He charges $40 for you to read marketing tool for his business.I have no doubt he also wrote these other glowing reviews of this book.
2,um yeah....no,I was hoping for more of a step by step guide toward opening your own office. I've been in practice with a major firm for years and often dream of my own office. this book didn't help at all. truthfully there was more useful free information on the web. look elsewhere if you are in the same boat as me.
1,Not so good,"Initially product is easy to use, the handle feels comfortable. The pads that are designed to stick to the wand head separate and if you are cleaning the tub you still have to bend over to retrieve the soggy pad and remove the remenants of the pad off the wand. It could be that the re-fill pads have sat on the store shelf too long and have lost their stick with-it-ness. The idea is great but not worth buying."
1,Doesn't work with Vista,"I was excited to get this game. I didn't know if it would work with Vista or not, everything is a gamble when it comes to Vista it seems. This will not work on Vista."
4,Concentration old and new,I bought this product for two reasons...First I use to play the game as a kid when it was on a scroll and small cards you placed on the grill over the screen.I loved it...I also purchased it to keep my mind working in the sense of guessing which space did I just see the item....Both have met my expectations and it is neat to play against the computer.So I rate it a 4 out of 5....
4,fun for all ages,this game is simple and fun for many ages. brings back memories for the older age group who watched on tv and family enjoyment for the younger. the youth like to win the cars challenge. much like the television show replete with announcer!
3,Interesting,A big part of it is just memory. Trying to remember which square matchesanother square. That is kid stuff in my opinion. But there are puzzlesunder the squares that are interesting. So people of any age could enjoythe game.
2,"Fun, but not durable...","I bought this for my daughter, who was 11 years old at the time. She used it quite a bit for the first two weeks, and was very happy with how it worked. After two months, it was completely dead, and changing the batteries made no difference. I don't expect great quality & craftsmanship out of appliances intended for kids, but this item isn't kid priced, it's expensive. This item is sort of like an Easy Bake oven--fun, but better to just teach your child to use the real thing. For the price, consider buying an inexpensive ice cream maker where you freeze the bowl instead of this toy.Hamilton Beach 68320 1-1/2-Quart Capacity Ice Cream Maker, White"
1,Didn't Work,"I was very excited to give this gift to my granddaughter. Mixed all the ingredients, turned it on---nothing happened. We had new batteries. We manually stirred the mixture during the freezing process. It tasted great when frozen."
5,Great for kids!,This product is great for kids and easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone because it uses simple ingredients. My kids loved the taste of the different flavors.
3,Coffee Travel Mug,The mug arrived in a reasonable amount of time and in good condition. The color was much brighter than I had anticipated so I was a little disappointed in that respect. I had one of these mugs that was a beautiful raspberry sherbert pink as opposed to the hot pink of this one. This one does leak slightly when on its side while the first mug never leaked at all. The only drawback is you have to be very careful when washing them due to the covering.
5,I love it,I just love it. It is perfect. My birds try to drink out of my cup and when I have tea in it I don't want them near it. Now I can drink my tea and keep my birds safe.
2,Not dishwasher safe,"I should have figured it out from the product's photo, but somehow I wasn't aware that I could not put this cup in the dishwasher until I got the actual mug. I try to avoid washing dishes by hand as much as possible, so it's a big minus as far as I'm concerned. In addition, I'm not sure how well the pink ""leather"" will behave with warm water and soap. I guess I'll have to find out, b/c I don't want to pay $5.5 return costs, so I'll keep it.For those who don't care about the dishwashing part the mug seems to be well made; it's very aesthetic and feminine.The part where you can sip your beverage from any part of the rim is very nice as well.If I could remove the leather wrap before washing it (like I did with my previous mug), I would have given it 4 stars."
5,Best travel mug on the market,"Excellent product, performance on ""no-leak"" superb, fits all car holders, good balance and lasts forever.Perfect for ladies without being too frilly."
3,Color shown is misleading,"The mug itself is fine and keep beverages hot/cold. I had ordered it because is was a bright, vibrant pink -- a nice color for a gift during Breast Cancer Awareness month (October). However, the color is a very pale, washed-out pink which was my only disappointment in the product."
3,Lovely but not leak proof,"This is a great looking travel mug. The color is perfect and girly. Sadly the one I had received leaked. So it wasn't going to be handy for me, plus it stated that wouldn't happen. If it didn't leak it would have been perfect. It is very big!"
2,"Pretty, but not completely functional","I loved the look of this mug, it feels solid too, nice leather like sides with a sturdy aluminum base but just don't turn the cup sideways or don't carry it in your tote bag on your way to work or you will find the contents of your mug in your tote, all over your papers, etc. When I purchase a travel mug, I would at least hope that if nothing else, they have made sure that it is leakproof, this one is not!"
5,Helps mend a Solid Foundation.,"With the little experience I have in this field thus far, it is by far that only as time goes on, will you become better at being a professional in public relations. Books, google, forums can only do so much for an inexperienced individual. BUT, this book does give you a SOLID FOUNDATION to your career. Obviously so does a good education, but this book attributes to that greatly. I recommend it, I thank those writers for creating this book, and hope all that are seeking to get better in this field find their own way."
4,PR Basics,"Not terribly useful to a pro, I've been told, but it certainly helped me shape my work as a novice doing PR writing."
4,A excellent PR working Tool.,This isent a book you should read and throw in the book shelf; It should be used as a desk tool on a daily basis because it gives excellent pointers on how a PR PRO should write.The examples given by Meery Aronson and Don Spetner are very close to the real thing.This book will give you the know-how on writing in the PR Business.
5,Finally! America gets it right.,"Every year, the winner of American Idol gets a cheesy, inspirational, almost gospel song written for them to release as their first single. This year was no exception. The difference? The winner. He takes a generic song and makes it his own. He puts his heart and soul into every lyric, and you can't help but enjoy it.Thank god for Taylor Hicks. This is what America needs.As a bonus, the second track is one of Taylor's best performances of the season, Taking it to the Streets. His rendition is worth the buying the cd by itself."
5,A Powerful Hicks Pleaser,"Mr. Hicks has taken the requisite American Idol final power ballad and tweaked it as only he can do. The result is an uplifting, powerful song that has a soulful, heartfelt quality. Listen a few times and you will soon be hooked not just on this song, but hooked on Hicks.The B side is his strong rendering of ""Takin' It To The Steets."" This song turned him into a superstar immediately on American Idol Season 5 and helped usher him to victory."
5,Taylor Hicks Rocks,My whole family and my friends at school think Taylor is the best singer from American Idol in a long time. We voted for him every week. He makes us proud and happy. Thank you Taylor Hicks!
4,"A strong debut for Taylor ""Soul Man"" Hicks","I used to hate Taylor at the beginning of the season, but he started to grow on me at the end of the season. I really became a fan after his heartfelt singing of ""Do I Make You Proud?"" after he won. I do wish that there was a new B-side song since we already have ""Takin' It To The Streets"" on the AI5 cd. Other than that, it is a very good debut single, I'm pretty impressed. Congrats Tay! I see you having a very successful career that will last a long, long time!"
5,He makes me very proud!,"Love Taylor, love the song. It is truly inspirational. A role model for anyone and everyone! Thanks for making Season 5 one that I will never forget!"
5,A superstar in the making,We have needed a performer/singer like Taylor Hicks for a long time. And I feel that is why he is so popular. He did a fabulous job on these two songs and I can't wait for his full cd:)
4,"Awesome, But Two Songs?","The songs sung by ""American Idol"" Taylor Hicks are wonderful. The choice of songs is wonderful, the personality--you can even hear it in his voice. Overall, great CD. However, American Idol, TWO SONGS? Come on. It's cheap and it's pitiful. Great CD, but only two songs makes it sink a little bit."
5,You make me proud....,"Taylor Hick's CD is great, just what I expected from the best American Idol yet!!!!! I would recommend it to all of Taylor's fans and all soul lovers."
4,Hicks proves he is a force to be reckoned with,"On 'Idol,' I couldn't stand Taylor. I thought his ticks and ""Wooooo! Soul Patrol!"" outbursts were so annoying. I was rooting for Katharine to win, eventhough I knew she didn't stand a chance. When I heard 'Do I Make You Proud' at the finale, I thought it was much better than Katharine's 'My Destiny.' The song has an inspirational message, though it is in the signature 'Idol Cheese' mold. The lyrics are fluff, but what 'Idol' singles' aren't? I wish they would have put a new song as the single's B-side, as 'Takin it to the Streets' has already been overdone. Anyways, congrats Taylor on recording an above-average single (and this is coming from a Kat fan)."
1,Gag Me With A Chainsaw,"What frikkin' imbecile told this dolt he could sing? My God! He is a disgrace to the human race! Who could listen to this trite, hackneyed, worn-out trash without thrusting railroad spikes through their eardrums? The fact that a totally talentless, vapid goon like this guy could become so popular is ample evidence that our culture has reached new lows of inanity and depravity. I implore you, I beg you- please DO NOT go anywhere near this abysmal filth if you value your sanity. It will drive you over the edge."
5,Another Elvis Coming!!!,"I think Taylor is going to be the next Elvis Presley. He is talented. He is sexy. He is a great singer, and he has got A LOT of stage presence! Awesome! The single is great, and I can't wait to hear more!~Forever A Fan-Sharon Kaminsky."
5,Happy In New Jersey,I loved the way Taylor Hicks sings and the way he carries himselfthe only thing I hate is that he doesn't get enough coverage and reconition for his hard work and accomplishments.
5,Taylor Hicks is the best Idol YET!,His voice is very amazing and the song is a inspirational song. He is a positive influence on American culture. Buy this CD Single while you still can!
5,Wonderful Taylor Hicks!,"Taylor is awesome! He does wonderful things with Do I Make You Proud. This song is a viable Pop Hit. And I love ""There's a Party goin' on"" on the 'Takin' it to the Streets' cut.This single shows Taylor's depth as to what he can do with a song--even one that's out of his normal, soul and blues comfort zone. The guy is just plain great!Groove on, Soulman!"
2,Just OK for me Dawg.....,"Taylor Hicks is a great performer, but just not a very good singer. While I totally enjoyed watching him on American Idol, listening to him without the visual is a very different experience. There is nothing unique about his voice, others like Michael MacDonald and Joe Cocker have been there, done that. I'm sure seeing him in concert would be a fun experience, but I don't think I'll be buying his full length CD when it comes out because his voice does not make me want to listen to it over and over like some of my other favorite artists."
2,definitely not the best,"Dont get me wrong, I like Taylor, just not obsessed like some people. This song is is definitely not his genere at all, in fact it's kind of cheezy.[...]"
5,Great Song,Do I Make You Proud is a great song for Taylor Hicks. Takin It To The Streets shows Taylor's true ability to sing from his heart and soul. I love both songs and look forward to purchasing more of his music from Amazon in the future.
5,This Alabama Boy Is A Star!!,"I live about 50 miles south of where Taylor Hicks lives. I saw all the celebration when Taylor came home on our local Fox station in Birmingham, Al. It was great. This kid may have gray hair but he has the ""spunk"" and command of the stage few entertainers have today. I just bought the cd at Wal-Mart today. We are proud of Taylor and I'm sure he will go far. Can't wait for his ""full"" cd release this fall."
5,COULD NOT WAIT FOR THIS,This is a Taylor Hicks being the American Idol. This is why he won the title. It's a very good start to a promising career. He shines on Do I Make You Proud and takes the song to another level. My only problem is that this is a single and you don't get more than two songs. Taking it to the streets is very good and a strong second song. Again Taylor Hicks shines on a old Doobie Brothers song. This is a must have cd. Taylor Hicks shows why he is the American Idol.
5,I like it!,I am totally enjoying Taylor's single CD. I love DIMYP and Takin it to the Streets. AI chose well for Taylor.I have 'Under the Radar' which is also a very good CD.Taylor rocks!
4,Good Job taylor,"He wasn't my favorite on AI, but that doesn't mean I'm going to come on here and knock his CD out of spite. Taylor can sing and he has soul...those are given. He is a natural performer and quite possibly the most charismatic artist I have seen in quite a while. He is able to successfully turn ""Do I Make You Proud"" into his own song and I'm impressed by that. While I loved ""Taking it to the Streets"" when he performed it on the show, the recorded version loses a lot of energy and appeal for me. However, the song is by no means horrible....it just loses some of its shine which is why I'm taking off 1 star. Definitely buy this CD single because it is worth your $3. In fact, both AI finalists' singles are worth the money.Congrats to Taylor and his success. I wish him nothing but the best for the future and he definitely has made all of his fans proud."
5,Wasn't Suprised,"Taylor Hicks is a great singer/songwriter/musician. I love him and his music. I am going to several of his concerts. I hope to meet him again, and maybe this time I will be able to sit and talk to him."
2,Wanted to Love It,"but really couldn't. Lyrics are simplistic and music is quite bland. Expected more from Taylor (he was my choice to win in his season), but this just didn't deliver."
5,Beautiful song!,"This song, ""Do I make you Proud"" by Taylor Hicks is really beautiful. I highly recommend it. It is the kind of song that gives you goose bumps and touches your heart."
2,You miss a lot when you do not see him in person.,"I must admit, Taylor was definitely the most entertaining contestant on AI. I loved his dancing and somewhat goofy expressions while singing. His musical talent is somewhat limited but he does a nice job nevertheless. While many people are critical of his lack of range, many other great artists have been just as limited and have managed to find just the right combination for their songs. Overall, I think Taylor has the potential of joining those whose songs he has used so far. I finally bought this CD and I must say it is not all bad. You do miss his showmanship and all is left is his musical ability which, again, is not totally bad, just different than more musically talented singers. He will score big in live concerts and TV shows."
3,do i make you proud/taylor hicks,"It was just so-so. Our family didn't care much for Taylor and his crazy gyrations, but apparently the rest of the world did. He was just okay. WE liked others much better and voted for Katharine mcphee the most. The cd was a special deal so we decided to purchase it. Recently gave it away to someone in the family who really liked Taylor......"
3,"A HUGE FAN, BUT I THINK THIS VERSION IS A LITTLE CHEEZY","I HAVE SEEN TAYLOR SING ""DO I MAKE YOU PROUD"" ON NUMEROUS TALK SHOWS SINCE HE WON, AND I THINK THIS VERSION IS TOO STUDIO PRODUCED. THE FIRST VERSE HAS A WIERD ECHO EFFECT WHEN TAYLOR IS TRYING TO HIT THE LOW NOTES. SOMETIMES YOU CAN OVER POLISH A SONG. MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION IS LESS STUDIO AND MORE JUST (RAW)TAYLOR. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT TAYLOR IS UNIQUE AND HE DOES MANAGE TO SHINE THROUGH AND GIVE HIS AUDIENCE WHAT THEY ARE CRAVING.THE SECOND OFFERING, ""TAKIN IT TO THE STREETS"" IS A GREAT RENDITION. TAYLOR SEEMS MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE IN HIS GENRE AND I HOPE THIS MORE OF THE DIRECTION HE GOES WITH THE UPCOMING ALBUM. TO BE FAIR, I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS 3.5 IF I HAD THE OPTION. STILL IT IS MUST HAVE FOR SOUL PATROL FANS AND WE HELP HOLD YOU OVER UNTIL THE FALL."
1,Stop this Idol mess now,Taylor is a one trick pony. Stop him now! There are tons more better than this man.
2,OK,"The songs don't have much power behind them and his voice doesn't vary much. It was OK, but definitely weak songs and an OK singer."
2,Average,"I didn't like ""Do I Make You Proud"" at all because I think they lost what made Taylor Taylor in it. However, ""Takin it to the streets"" redeemed Taylor and moved it up from below average to average."
5,DIMYP,"Awesome! Taylor does a wonderful job with this song. I love listening to it over and over. This song will be one that is played for years to come as a love song, at graduations, weddings, and as a tribute to our U.S. military. Taylor puts his heart and soul into this song and truly makes me proud!!"
5,It's Taylorized!,"The words to DIMYP are very beautiful, but without the Taylorization it would be kind of dull. Taylor has such a unique and wonderful voice.[...]"
5,I love it!!,I really love both songs! Do I make you proud could end up to be a wedding song a son could dance with him mother or a daughter with her dad!! I highly recommend this cd!
5,A Passionate Performance,"Taylor is a breath of fresh air to the music industry. Finally, a performer who can sing a song with conviction and passion in his voice. He truly cares for the music. I give him a standing ovation for this CD, and I can't wait until the full CD comes out this fall. GO TAYLOR!Love,Tailormade"
5,Totally Soulful.,"I had heard many negative reviews on Taylor Hicks's 'Do i make you proud' around the industry . Althought i do have to agreed that this would not be his best, but, it's certainly one of Taylor's best though.Taylor really had put many efforts to blow this song and it works, i can feels the soul of his voice whenever i litsens to the track.Althought the lyrics of 'Do i make you proud' is kinda simple, but, it's meaningful, and it does has a special meaning to Taylor.As for B-Side, 'Takin it to the Street', Taylor did well on this song too.Overall to me, this single by the soulman is totally soulful in his way, it worth the buy and do give a try on this if you haven't yet.I am looking forward for his debut album, good luck Taylor Hicks, the new idol!"
5,I give Taylor 10 Stars,"Taylor is beyond the best there is! You don't just listen to him when he sings, you feel him deep within your soul! I highly recommend anything this gifted artist sings! I am so proud!"
5,Taylor Hicks~Legend in the Making,"I don't think that the world realizes what is happening, what we are experiencing. I am not going to compare Taylor Hicks to anyone else because he is an original. There are no others just like him. He has an amazing gift and it will only get better and better now that he has the opportunities to get some real training done. His first ""cd"" is just a small taste of what he can do. As much as I love his song, ""Do I Make You Proud?"", I know how much more Taylor has to offer. He has done more for my musical appetite than any other artist in a long, long time. I am hungry for music, new music, music that I never considered before, music that I am willing to pay for, all thanks to Taylor. So, musicians everywhere can thank Taylor Hicks for his inspiration to get back to the real music out there. Congratulations, Taylor!!! And, yes, you make us all very, very proud."
5,Taylorizing the World - One Soul at a Time!,"It's been a long time since I've been so wrapped up in one man's voice, but Taylor puts his very heart and soul into his music, and makes us literally ""feel"" what he's singing.I've never bought an American Idol single before, but I absolutely cannot get enough of ""Do I Make You Proud"" and STILL get goosebumps when he starts to sing it. The screams and thunderous applause when he introduced it at the AI finals made it quite clear that he did and does indeed make us proud!Taylor is here to stay; he is fast becoming a household name, and I can hardly wait for his full album to come out in November. I love this guy!"
5,Momof6boys is proud!!,"Way to go Taylor!! You taylorized the song made it truly inspriational. Just when I thought I couldn't love you more than I already did, you proved me wrong. I can't wait to hear what is next for you. Taylor will always be my idol!! Thanks and yes, you make me proud!!"
5,Outstanding,I can hardly wait for the release of Taylor's full album this fall. Do I Make You Proud is a great first release for this wonderful new music artist!!!
1,I love Taylor HIcks--I hated the quality of this download,I love Taylor HIcks--I hated the quality of this download.Why has no one commented on it--I wasted my money!! now I have to get it somewhere else
3,Awwww Taylor - Not Unique Enough,"I'll give 3 stars, but 2 might have been more what I shoulda done. When I sit back, crank it up and listen, I can't tell Taylor's vocals apart from too many others voices - some have been mentioned in other reviews. Guess I just liked his silliness on stage, but when I just listen, it doesn't do much for me. Hope his CD shows a little more vocal range and is a better, more versatile listen. Come on, Taylor, go after it. Oh well, he must have some good marketeers because Amazon offers a special price if you buy his single with AI5 CD, but Katherine McPhee's single is paired with Taylors for a special price. This could get Taylor some extra sales."
2,"A fan of Taylor, but not of the single","I'll buy Taylor's CD when its released, but this single was a little disappointing. I couldn't get through ""Do I Make You Proud?"" and ""Takin' It To The Streets"" (the better of the two songs) was already featured on the American Idol Encore CD.I hope he is able to write some of his own material for his upcoming CD. I have his self-released albums on my iPod and I love quite a number of those songs."
1,Not good at all,"Well I've to say Taylor was never one of my favorite during idols, and this single didn't change anything. DIMYP is simply a badly-written song, it is too idolish and the title of the song is worse. ""Takin'it To the Streets"" is not bad, but it's not that good either. It's not even one of his best performance. Anyhow, I would like expect more for his new album. I guess he still has that star factor, which makes him become the Idol"
2,Poor first effort,"I really am a Taylor fan, but this single does not do his voice justice. It's a poorly produced song (as are most of the AI 'singles'), and his voice sounds flat in many spots throughout. It's a shame, but he doesn't sound nearly as well when there is no ""visual"" of him performing. I hope his ability to sing in a studio improves over time, or we will be saying ""Taylor who??"""
2,Good job Taylor!,"This Cd was ok...but not the best. Taylor was good this season, but i dont think he is idol material, and this CD proves it. The songs are weak and too raspy IMO."
5,Destined to be a CLASSIC!,"""Do I Make You Proud"" is the PERFECT song for graduation, father/daughter dance, awards ceremonies, military homecoming, etc, etc.... I just used it as the background music for my daughter's kindergarten graduation video. Not a dry eye in the house. Taylor will be around for a long time. Beautiful sandpaper on silk voice. Amazing energy & soul. Don't pass this one up!"
5,TAKES A OK SONG AND TAYLORIZES IT,This isn't the best song Taylor hicks could have been given. However it's worth buying and I'll tell you why> Taylor hicks can take a song and make it his own as he did in Do I make You Proud. For his first single any fan of taylors needs to buy this single. Taking it to the streets is a good cover of a old doobie brothers song. Even if you've never heard Taylor Hicks it's a single worth buying. You will also be supporting our troops because it is now their theme song. We are trying to send as many as possible to them because of the demand. There is also a video and the song will be played by most of the radio stations on july 4th. A must have single from a must have artist
1,I don't get it,"The gap between the reviewers who liked this book and those that didn't like it is amazing. I read the book a few weeks ago, after seeing so much of the Knoxville Area press, and reading these reviews. My verdict: it's simply poor writing. The characters are all cliches of ""drug hell"" literature: the listless but salvageable protagonist, the hyper-intelligent and (we are told by the author) ""charismatic"" drug gang leader, the dutiful drug groupie girlfriends, the ""wild and crazy"" decadent bunch. The ""metaphors"" for various evils, etc, fall flat. The reader is expected to be shocked because the author all but says directly ""You are reading something shocking."" The women characters in particular are one dimensional. Reading this book just didn't prove to be the ""gripping"" or ""couldn't put it down"" experience that has been mentioned here."
1,Amazing and audacious,"The fact that anyone would publish a book this bad is amazing.The only thing horrifying about this book is its attack on prose. Idon't know what book all these other reviewers read, because the ""Killer of Love"" that I got a hold of was full of high school level writing and self- conscious hyperbole. It reads like a 1950s ""killer teen"" trash novel. To say that the characters were flat and ""cardboard"" would be an insult to paper products everywhere. Piper, the supposed ""root of all evil,"" was only as frightening as the average open mike night poet. I wish whoever is paying these other people to write in would just stop. I only gave this one star because it made me."
2,So-So,"This book is okay, so-so, but kind of reads like a Judy Blume novel for teenagers about junkies, that was my take anyway."
4,WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE!,"The dark side of Knoxville, Tennessee is the topic of this spine-tingling novel of drug-addiction and anarchy. Jimmy Love is a rebellious teenager who comes under the influence of bad company in the form of Piper, who introduces him to alcoholism, drug addiction and general mayhem. Piper mesmerizes Jimmy until Jimmy finally begins to recognize that he is involved in a web of increasing evil and that the end result will be his damnation unless he can free himself of his various demons. This is a book of rare substance and I look forward to the author's next book."
3,Nice watch for a Small Wrist,Kind of disappointing because I purchased the watch for my husband and when we received it it was a lot smaller than we thought. Oh well...........I have another watch to add to my collection.
5,one of my favorite latin jazz CDs,"Paquito D'Rivera, Arturo Sandoval, Giovanni Hidalgo, Mark Walkerr...and more...what more can you ask forFriday Morning, Tanga, Reunion, and Body & Soul are the highlights of this CD...although all the tunes are great.I'm absolutely in love with Friday Morning...This is a great Latin jazz CD...a good representation of the genre. I'd say a classic of it.But it."
2,barely worth reading,"Most of this is devoted to describing his life after he became a farmer living with whites. It's as if his life with the Indians had no substance, no worth.This was a big disappointment. I was expecting another ""Falcon"" by John Tanner.Best thing about this is the end notes that mention other frontier texts you can download for free as PDFs.If you're an Ohio native and Ohio history buff you might get a kick out of seeing familiar place names mentioned. For me, it was a real struggle. The narrator didn't seem to care about his life, so I didn't either.At least it was fairly easy reading and there were no typos."
3,the mystery of cloomber,Just does not compare to his sherlock holmes stories. takes to longto get to the main plot. The ending is too far-fetched.
4,The Mystery of Cloomber,"This is a very entertaining work by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who wrote of course the splendid Sherlock Holmes stories he is so deservidly famous for. But he also wrote many other works, among them this fine story of a young man and his family moving to a very remote area of Scotland to be the landlord of a relative's estate. Shortly after they are settled in they meet a new neighbor, a retired English General and his family. The General is pleasant enough to them but his odd and reclusive behavior begin to manifest itself in ways which the author can't understand. Doyle includes mystery and suspense in this book, but as often the case in many of his other non-Sherlock Holmes stories, such as The Captain of the Polestar, there is some mysticism or occult part that is very significant to the story. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope that you do too."
5,Harcore Forever!!,This cd along with all their other compilations are simply great! Hard and pumping....just the way I like it! (Not to mention their parties are off the hook!)
1,suxx0rz,"This is what happens when monkeys get payed to make music.All this is is just repetative nonsense. And not very good repetative nonsense at that. Or maybe I'm just jealous because I can't hear ""the beat."" xD"
3,Ummm...someone bring me a dictionary,"Whoa...This is some heavy stuff...Some of it is funny, like the part on alienating your judges, but there are so many technical words...i wouldnt suggest this book for the lighthearted reader on singing...but its a great book if you have a large vocabulary and if you have a dictionary handy...go for it."
5,Shipping cost,The book I ordered was new and in good condition. I was a little surprised at how much I was charged to ship it.
4,"Bauhaus, Yet Another History Text","Somewhat dry reading, but quite detailed and informative.This book doesn't touch much upon the actual art/design that came out of the Bauhaus, but rather is concentrated on the social-political-historical context of the environment that existed at the time.From previous books on the subject I have read, I knew that things weren't easy for Walter Gropius and the Bauhaus.This book clearly brings things into a sharper focus.This book was not exactly what I was expecting, but nevertheless I still found it informative and interesting.The *extensive* notes cited in the back of the book, belies the fact that some serious homework was done and it shows."
4,Natural Sugar Treat,"I don't use sugar that much but when I do I like GOOD sugar and this is one of the best. I bought this in October, 2009 and recently pulled out a couple pounds from the pantry to put in the kitchen canister and they were BRICKS. They did not arrive that way. I was annoyed so beating them with the mallet was a pleasure. I'd be on the Customer Service Line if they were unusable, this ran about 2 bucks and a half a pound - expensive when unusable. Another option that's pretty good isFlorida Crystals Natural Sugar, Milled Cane, 48-Ounce Jug (Pack of 2)But it has clumps and lumps that need busting no bricks.My body doesn't handle artificial sweeteners or High Fructose Corn Syrup well, does a passable job with beet sugar, so I do search out cane sugar especially Natural Milled Cane Sugar."
1,Thanks for the bricks,"Disappointed!! These ten little bricks, used from a previous review, are cumbersome to use because they are solidified from moisture. They are not worth the trouble. Yes... I am so disappointed."
3,Not bad to build a house with,"The sugar tastes great; however, mine arrived in a state I can only compare to hardened cement. Thankfully, I have a kitchen mallet, and after putting the sugar bricks into a plastic storage bag and beating the smack out of the packages, was able to pour it into my sugar container. (It was still lumpy.) Since I live in an extremely dry climate, I don't think the product became brick-like upon arriving. It must have gotten some moisture in transit. So, if yours arrives still granulated, you'll probably be pleased... with the sugar anyway. Much to my shagrin, after I ordered it, I found some organic sugars on Amazon that are less expensive and arrive in perfect condition in nice little resealable bags. So maybe you should keep looking?"
3,target shipping is terrible,"I wouldn't order this or anything else from target, it takes forever to get here...not sure if it is taking the slow barge or what from minnesota but the expected date of arrival is a range of 2 weeks!!! Would like to review this product too, if only it would get here..."
4,"Good, solid, light-weight, unpadded carrier bag.","With the purchase of the FAA-Approved harness system for toddlers/children, we wanted to do away with the bulk of lugging the carseat through the airport. We found that even with gate-checking a car seat, it can get pretty banged up and abused in transit. For our most recent trip (round-trip, one connection each way), we used this Car Seat Travel Bag and found it to be a nice way to check in the car seat along with our other luggage. After a couple of practice runs, getting our big seat into and out of the bag was easy. The side zip pocket was perfect for stashing some car window shades and the strap (for check in). So far, in our limited use, the bag seems quite sturdy and the strap makes the heavy car seat ""sling-able"" for short walks."
4,Did its job for the most part,"I got this bag to save my carseat from the unknown that is under a commercial airplane. My convertable carseat is HUGE and it fit inside with no problems. We packed diapers and extra books inside the bag and everything arrived safely with no rips, stains, or damage. However, the bag is not waterproof. We flew during a heavy rainstorm and when we arrived at our destination and got our seat it was SOAKED along with everything else in the bag. My son had to ride in a soaking wet carseat until we reached our destination. I will use this bag again for our next trip but if they are predicting rain I will probably but my carseat in a garbage bag first."
3,Great bag but wrong product description,This bag does the job in protecting the car seat. It's big and we could pack lots of extra stuff in it. But the description says it has wheels. It hasn't. It also took forever to be delivered.
5,"good price, good product","We bought this and a more expensive version of the same thing, and both held up equally well and were equally easy to use on our cross-country trip. We put a Britax Marathon seat into this bag and it fit well."
2,Not the multi-tasker we'd hoped for,"We bought this bag so we could check our son's carseat with our other luggage when flying. His Britax Companion (bucket-style) seat fits well in the bag with some room to spare for other items, but the bag ripped in a couple of spots on its first trip, so it's already sporting some duct tape repairs. Also, the handle is very poorly placed/designed, making it hard for average-sized adults to roll it on its wheels without hunching over a considerable amount."
1,Sleepless Nights/Those Sweet Words~Norah Jones,This CD had only two songs and one of them from Norah Jones original album. Very poor value based on the cost of the CD over $ 18.00.
1,Nora Jones Sleepless and also Nora Jones Sunrise,I think the songs were beautiful and Nora sang very well but the cost was outrageous for such a short CD.
2,Norah Jones,"Once again, I am not a fan but my Mother is. Shw owuld probably give her 4 stars, Me, no."
2,sleepless nights,"I was disapointed because it only had 2 songs for about the same priceas a regular cd, plus i did not know it was manufactured in china"
2,"Great Idea, Poorly executed","APC has some great technology. There's a lot of good thinking that went into this, but I think they ignored the user when they designed this.Sometimes companies don't know their limits. The person who will want something like this is a road warrior who needs to bring multiple devices with them in order to do their job. Probably a more limited market than originally conceived. As I said, APC knew the technology behind this, but should have partnered with someone like a Coach or TUMI for the execution as it is a bag FIRST and utility of the power source is second. JMHO."
4,"Oh darlin', won't you buy me a new Cadillac.....","This is a fine story, presented in a very entertaining way. It took me right back to that time and place I missed, by about 30 yrs. I'm kind of glad I wasn't there, then. But it's a vivid read. It'll grab your attention, from page 1, and when you've finished it, you'll want to read other stories of Rick's. He's one cool dude; a real Oregon treasure! Take my word for it, and buy this book today! If he won't autograph it. I will. I am Nobody."
4,"People depicted as grouchy and cantankerous, which is a way to cope","This collection of cartoons follows no political, social or economic agenda. They are just funny, presenting people in situations where they are grouchy, cantankerous and sometimes just trying to cope in unusual ways. The faces of the people are drawn in exaggerated caricature; there are large noses and generally wild hair. Underneath it all, there is the reality of how we often feel about the world. Just let me live my life, have what little pleasure I can get and stay out of my way. I enjoyed these cartoons, although dark, they have a refreshing approach to how you handle life."
1,Disappointed,"My husband and I both own this phone for 7 months. It does not hold many MP3's at all and when you play the MP's, you cannot receive incoming calls! The memory used to store your music is shared with the memory for your pictures.It completely goes haywire for no apparent reason at least twice a month.The vibrate mode works intermittently.The speakerphone is impossible for the person you are talking to to understand you.The message envelope has been stuck on my display since the first week I started using it.The paint is flaking off of it..My Bluetooth earphone gets static if the phone is more than a foot away from it...I get an error every other time I try to connect to the internet."
1,This phone is horrible and Sprint is not helping matters.,"My wife and I both have the Samsung A900M phones and are very disappointed in their performance. Both phones repeatedly lose Bluetooth connection to our earpiece and have unclear reception when the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece. Both phones periodically lose all battery life within 4 hours of a full charge. The phones also reboot and freeze (requiring battery removal to reset) due to Bluetooth earpiece connection or disconnection. Missed alerts create makes it operate slow and inconsistently. Today, my phone started mysteriously heating up which caused me to remove the batter for fear that it might blow up.Repeated visits to the Sprint service stores yield only phone replacements with another phone that has the same problems and that is after waiting 30 minutes or more to see a service tech. I even showed them video of these malfunctions. Having the Sprint service plan does not help when they keep giving you the same bad phone."
2,Average,"Great phone but the HUGE downside is that the battery life is absolutely pitiful... Only buy this phone if you plan on talking on it while its being plugged in 24/7. Honestly, it wont even last a full day being on with a few text messages and 5 minute conversations here and there. what a joke. I love the phone, when it's actually on!"
2,Looks can be deceiving,"Yeah it looks cool, but it's got terrible sound quality, even with an ear-piece. Additionally, they've crammed a lot of stuff into the menus that would probably be desirable to some people, but if you don't want it, it's just more junk to have to navigate through.Might want to keep looking."
2,Stay Away,"I've had mine for more than a year. I was initially very disappointed with the speakerphone. Now with the battery life dying by the week, I need to get a new phone.Pros:1) Sleek designCons:1) Speakerphone is almost unusable! Horrible quality on both ends of conversation.2) Battery life falls off fast."
4,nite glow frisbee,"This frisbee is so fun at nite. Our dog loves it. Only down side, be careful with middle where battery. Is. Can get loose. But fun for evening. Really glows bright"
3,Smaller than expected,"It's smaller than expected (guess I shoulda checked the measurements), and it doesn't have the fiberoptics that bring the light to the outer edge of the frisbee. The plastic is nice and soft. I haven't tried playing with it yet."
3,Great boot....check your soles,"This is a great boot right out of the gate but check your soles, if you look at sites like Backcountry and REI you will find that like myself a growing number of fugitive owners are seeing the soles separate from the upper with little to medium use! the comfort and support are present but the durability is in question here!"
5,"Asolo Fugitive GTX are ""Amazing"" Boots","The Asolo Fugitive GTX Hiking Boots are not only very comfortable and rugged, but they are sexy as well. Enjoy."
1,Soles are falling apart,"Have these boots, not specifically this model, but a similar Asolo boot, and the soles are disintegrating! Large chunks are falling off as I walk and soon all the rubber on the bottom will have fallen off! There is hardly any wear on the boot itself, it looks new, but the soles are gone! This shouldn't happen to a boot that costs this much! I would never buy Asolo again, there are better boots out there."
5,A very good album with that unmistakable Gordon Lightfoot sound,"Born in Canada in 1938, Gordon Lightfoot's rich baritone voice accompanied by his excellent guitar work has made him a favorite for more than 40 years. Shadows, which was first released in 1982, marks a bit of a transformation for him, marking a more serious move away from the purely acoustical sound of his past. But, one shouldn't make too much of that. The album is very good indeed, with that unmistakable Gordon Lightfoot sound.Overall, I think that this album has a great sound. Each of the songs sounds clear and excellent to me, and I love leaving it playing for hours on end as I slave away at my desk. I really enjoy all of the songs, and would be hard pressed to select any as better than the rest.So, if you like great, soulful music, created by a master musician, then get this album. I highly recommend it!"
5,Don't miss this CD!,"I Love to Yodel volume 2 from Jasmine has been a welcome addition to my country music collection. Opening with a Wilf Carter song `Sweet Little Lover' the album moves through a range of well known artists such as Rex Allen Sr, Elton Britt, and Red River Dave all with wonderful songs. In particular is Johnny Granger from New Zealand singing `Idaho State Fair' - which I am sure, will be enjoyed by everyone. Johnny Granger did not record often and this song would be one of his best. I Love to Yodel volume 2 is a wonderful album and I fully recommend this."
3,Ukulele for parties,I was a bit disappointed in this ukulele although it served it's purpose for our Luau. The cloth case for it did not come with it as advertised. I had to contact the merchant to have it sent separately.
3,Out of tune,"I got this Ukulele as a gift for someone. I guess I can't expect too much out of a beginner Ukulele, but ever my sister who I got this for (who has never played) even commented on how it sounded off and very out of tune."
4,Great first 'real' guitar/ukelele for a child,"This is such a HUGE hit with my 3 year old son. He loves that it's real and it's the perfect size. He rarely plays with his plastic electronic ones anymore. Quality seems to be good and strings are durable. Some of the paint job on the fret board is a bit shotty, but for a 3 yr. old, it's perfect."
3,"""if the bank machines crash we'll be just fine""","This version of ""a country boy can survive"" is Chad Brock's reworking of the Hank Williams Jr. classic, made to address the y2k scare. Bocephus appears on the track along with country legend George Jones. I am a huge fan of Hank Jr.'s version and really wish George would've been featured more prominently.The track is sort of fun, but nowhere near as good as the original. In addition to the altered lyrics, the music has more of a ""new country"" tinge than the original. Some of the redone lyrics just aren't as catchy in my opinion. For example, instead of ""we're some ol boys raised on shotguns"", Brock sings ""we'll survive the new millenium"".There is one change, however, that makes a statement. When Hank's New Yorker friend is killed he says of the criminal: ""dude's gonna get out in a year or two, cuz the system don't work for me and you""."
4,OK EXCEPT FOR SISSY VOICE,"I am one of Hank Jr.'s biggest fans and anytime I hear one of his tunes I get a real adrenaline rush and to hear George Jones, a real country legend, singing with Bocephus makes it that much better. On the other hand, Chad Brock's high pitched voice doesn't fit in with this Bocephus tune. If you are a Bocephus fan, buy this one and sing along loudly on Chad Brock's parts."
1,Just Whisper In My Ear,"All the negative reviews of this toy are true. I thought maybe those people just had some bad models, but mine was worthless as well."
2,A little bit dissappointed...,I got these walkie-talkies for a gift. I was there when the kids opened the package and started playing with it. They had to be very close to listen to each other and they got bored of playing with it very soon...
2,More static than talk,We were hopeful these would be better walkie talkies than our last pair but that didn't turn out to be the case. There is really more static than talk.
2,Not awesome!,"These don't reach very far. I took them to the grocery store so my 6 year old could go a couple aisles away to get an item and come back, we couldn't hear each other. The boys have fun with them from the kitchen to living room, sometimes they work for that."
1,A lemon,"We received the walkie talkies as a gift and my 4 year old son was very excited about it. But it does not work at all even when you're standing next to each other. It's just straight up static on both ends. My kid still seems moderately amused by it, but it is totally worthless as a walkie talkie."
5,beautiful souls create beautiful music,"What a change from the ""typical"" music designed for children. I enjoy this music as much as the children I treat everyday in therapy sessions. As an Occupational Therapist, I can use this music to soothe as well as stimulate the minds and bodies of my clients. A wonderful gift for anyone who needs love, compassion, and faith in their life."
3,Less than expected,"It is not as if I expected a very sturdy box, but I expected it to be a little better constructed. Some snaps in some of the boxes were already loose when I receive them. The black paper lining of most is curling up at the edges because it was not stuck with enough adhesive. In other words, these look much cheaper than I expected or that described. I am disappointed because it is a good concept. All they needed was some basic good manufacturing practices to get them done consistently right. I don't think they are worth what I paid for them."
3,wish they were a but taller,these work great for CD's in paper sleeves but in boxes or jewel cases the lids do not go down snug.
5,Snap N Store Storage Boxes,Great value--probably not for someone that wants something decorative--these are just for storage. Stack nicely!! Arrived promptly as always!!! Thanks
5,Great Little Storage Container,"I was first surprised at the quality for the price. The idea of a snap-together style storage container that would actually be very sturdy had me a little aprehensive about purchasing this. But, for the price, I thought I would gamble and order these anyway. Such a simple idea, but they really do work. Hopefully this particular storage container will continue to be sold by Amazon, because I will be buying more in the future."
3,OK. Not Great.,"They will work to hold CD's in jewel cases, but they have a few flaws. They're relatively cheaply constructed for the price and would not stand up to being used daily. They are better suited to long term storage. The snaps are cheap, and 2 out of 16 of them did not work, but the boxes held together with the remaining snaps. The boxes are shorter than the jewel cases, meaning the cover rests on the jewel cases. They must be nearly full to keep the covers on. They will work for storage, so I'm satisfied."
3,Too short and snaps don't line up.,"I'd like to echo the reviews of a few other buyers. The boxes are too short, so the tops really don't sit very tight. I also found that on some of the boxes, the snaps would not line up. They're not all that bad, but I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Just okay,"This does its job of holding cds together in a container. You can stack boxes on top of each other, and they even look decent. But I don't like the fact that the box is not very secure. The lid does not snap shut at all, you can easily knock it off, or something could get inside. I live in California and if there were an earthquake and the box gets hit by something or falls off the shelf, all the cds would surely scatter all over the floor. They should have been a little less cheap making these and have a secure way to shut the lid."
4,Looks Cheap but Not...,"Bought this CD box thinking it would be cheap. Got the 2pack box, snapped it togethere and loved it. I was so wrong, stronge, durable box. If you want to store CD's this is the box to do it in."
1,DO NOT BUY - TAPE DESTROYS THE PRODUCT,"The tape used by the manufacturer to hold the pieces together DESTROYS the outside of each box. The tape is standard, transparent packing tape and a LOT of it is wrapped around the snap-together parts. The whole, taped package of two boxes is also shrink-wrapped, so you must tear that off to detect the product-destroying tape.When un-taped, ALL the adhesive remains on the paper exterior of both boxes in the package. It took me 40 minutes, half a can of Goop-Off and half a roll of paper towels to make this product minimally serviceable.Buy something else, ANYTHING else, than this:Snap-N-Store SNS01617 CD Storage Box, 2 Pack (Black)"
3,CD Storage,"Needed containers for storing CD cases in a cabinet with only shelves. I have assembled one case of six purchased and experienced the problem report by others... some of the snaps do not lock together securely and I will have to use some glue or epoxy on them to keep them from coming unsnapped. Otherwise, case will do the job for CD storage."
3,Not as bad as some have suggested,"This product was the size that I needed, and the ONLY thing out there that I found that is the size that I needed, so I took the leap. I would consider it to be a bit overpriced for what you get, but at least at this point I have not had the problems with unsnapping that others describe. Of course I didn't buy this thing to be portable. I put it together, inserted my CDs and then stuck it in a place of holding."
3,"It Works, But Barely","I have 25 of these to store my CD collection. It does an adequate job, but that's it. Each box comes in a folded manner and you have to snap the unit together. A couple of the boxes had problem snapping together firmly. Some boxes are out of square when snapped together. The main compartment height is slightly shorter than a CD Jewel case, so if you don't fill the box up, the lid won't go on securely."
3,Not tall enough,"These boxes are easy to put together and the perfect size for storing CDs in their cases. However, if you want to save space and move your CDs into the plastic sleeves that were recommended by Amazon and use the alphabetical dividers, also recommended by Amazon, the boxes are not tall enough. The dividers and the tabs on the sleeves for the labels stick up above the rim of the box so the lid no longer fits down tight. Instead the box top just sits on top of the labels and dividers. You can't tell when you look at the box, but when you pick it up, you can feel that the lid is not on tight. I would suggest the sleeves with no label tab and a shorter divider system, if there is one."
2,Did not meet expectations,"I purchased 4 of these based on customer reviews. I use them to store music CDs in jewel cases. I store them on a shelf inside an entertainment unit with doors. The units look nice, but do not stay snapped when being pulled off the shelf. I would only recommend these if they are going to be stationary and not pulled out and put away often."
5,Great for NES Collectors!,"I have been looking for a place to store my ever-expanding NES game collection for years... Sure, I would love to have some nice shelving to display them all, but the truth is, I just do not have room right now. I have tried various types of sturdy plastic notes, but the problem is that they are all basically a trapezoidal shape... too wide at the top, too narrow at the bottom. The games rock around loosely inside, and the empty area on the sides is a waste of closet space.Finally, I found these. They fit the size of a standard licensed NES game nearly perfectly, and fit most unlicensed games, also. They stack well, and I have never had one fall apart on me. They are also sturdy enough for the job. It was the answer I needed.I am also about to try the Snap-N-Store CD boxes with two rows... I will review them as soon as I get them, as well."
2,box sizing is off,"I thought the quality of the product (materials, snaps) was fine. The problem is more of a design flaw. The lid sits just on top of the CDs once you put them in, so it's not really secure. It would've been a perfect box if it was taller than the height of a CD."
4,Not bad,"These are pretty nifty storage boxes for CD's. They ship flat and you snap them together to form the box. The snaps are not the strongest, but I think they'll hold as long as you're not too aggressive with the box. Another drawback is that the lid does not snap or secure onto the box, it just lays on top. Not a big deal. Overall it's a decent item."
2,Snaps are crap,"I didn't expect much for the price, but the snaps should at least line up and stay snapped. They don't."
4,A glimpse into the 16th Century Korea,"The movie is set months before Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasion of the Korean peninsula and portrays two relatively obscure historical figures. Mong-Hak Lee, an illegitimate son of the king, led a rebellion that ended in failure, and Jung-Hak Hwang was one of the top three medical practitioners in the Chosun Dynasty. The plot is simple - a son pursuing his father's killer - but what makes the movie interesting is the historical background. The society was so mired in rigid class system that prevented certain people (e.g. illegitimate children) from rising farther regardless of their abilities, and the ruling class was so bent on party politics that one would automatically oppose the other regardless of the facts (i.e. both parties knew that the Japan invasion was imminent)."
3,Blades Of Blood,"The story plot was good as well as the actors who portrayed in in. Action was dispersed throughout most of the movie and the blind man, very much along the lines of ""Zatoichi"" did a good job. Overall, I rated this movie as just ok in comparison to many Korean martial arts movies that I have seen that I have rated very good especially in regards to the plot and the fight scenes."
2,Just ok!,"It really wasn't what I thought it would be. Terrible voice acting for this late in the genre. The main character couldn't even fight. A total rent, I wouldn't recommend spending the money..."
4,great long distance connection,"this product offers a great connection to your home audio system if you have the upgraded sound blaster live output panel with the digital output. It is difficult to locate a cable of this length to connect your pc to your receiver, but monster does a great job of it, even if they are overpriced"
3,"Not as pictured, but works great",I give this a bad review because it is not whats is pictured. It shows a toslink to optical audio but this is simply optical audio to optical audio. works great.
5,Great length Great price,For the price and length of the is optical cable you cant beat it..Monster puts out some quality good stuff//If your looking for length and quality to get that nice hd surround sound this is great!!!
3,Fair enough,"Alot of people say that Monster Cable is overrated. True, they are expensive. I use Monster Cable accessories because I know what kind of improvements to expect from them. Often times, the people here who have issues with Monster Cable, or any sort of a/v cable for that matter, often times do not have high performance a/v equipment. While I'm far from one of those theaterphiles who get paid to test new equipment in specific soundrooms, I do know enough to be able to distinguish what I (emphasis on I) sounds/looks better for my specific needs. Bottom line, Monster cables are a step up from the cables you'll receive with your equipment and will be more distinguishable if you have the right components. I use these digital cables because I have surround sound speakers and a Samsung receiver. If you're someone who does not have or plan on using surround sound, then you probably don't want to shell out money for this digital cable."
3,Optical is optical,"Yeah, I don't get this obsession with Monster brand cable either. When I got my 5.1 set-up, I thought the only way to get 5.1 sound was to use an optical wire anyway. Well, on my system it was, as it had no RCA jacks for all those discrete channels. All it has is one optical jack and one set of L/R RCA jacks for a stereo VCR source.So all I did was go to Wal Mart or Radio Shack (can't remember which) and bought the only optical cable they had for like 20 bucks. Works just fine. My problem if anything is my receiver. But I think I'll be upgrading sometime later this year."
1,Not as pictured,This item is not the one pictured. This is a standard optical cable on both ends. I needed the mini earphone style plug at one end to plug into my Mac.
1,More Monster hype,"""High velocity of propagation for lower time smear""What does this mean? The light from the source to the destination over this 1 meter cable probably takes 4 to 5 billionths of a second. I would like to know how this time affects anything sonically, as even golden ears who claim they can hear 100 kHz are talking about 10 millionths of a second cycle time.Light's light - buy the cheapest optical you can find. If it works, it will sound just as good as this overpriced stuff."
1,Optical is optical,"Monster could sell ice to EskimosI do agree that cables make a difference when electronis devices are involved, however a fibre optic cable will not make one iota of difference to the sound quality when compared to another - no questions, full stop.An illustration of how some people will buy anything is the crazy guy who said his picture improved!Enough said"
2,Pay More = Get More,"This horn lasted about 2 months, then died the death. You get what you pay for. Buy a more expensive horn."
2,Disappointing,"A jumbled and slow moving subtitled film that disappoints as a police procedural. However, it does give some sociological insights into the rampant poverty, criminality and juvenile justice complexities of Russia and Brazil in the early 2000's."
2,Mixed Review,"This book provides a good overview of blacks (slave and free) in New York. It's a very good reference (encyclopedic) book.My main problem with it is that Leslie M. Harris, the author, relies heavily (if not entirely) on secondary sources. The book, then, is nothing more than a patchwork of various other more scholarly works. Hence, finding the actual primary source (i.e. court decision, council minutes, etc) proves extremely difficult.I do not recommend this book for advanced students. If, however, you're interested in an easy read and don't care about sources, this is the book for you."
1,imposter monster or black sheep of the monster family ?,"watch out for this one folks , says 20 ft. is less than 18 . quality is so so too , so much so that this long time pro monster customer thinks this is a possible knock off . if it isnt , it sure is a poor choice of monster to market . ive used and purchased myriads of monster products in the music business and own hundreds of dollars in monster cables personally . pros expect more from monster....."
5,Labels for envelops,"Great labels. I especially like the opaque nature of these white labels. If you make a mistake, you can just put another label on top of the previous one.Sticks great."
5,Great Labels,"There's not much to say about labels, but these are excellent. If your word processing program doesn't come with a label program Avery offers a way go online and print them without downloading software. I use an older Office 2003 template and it works fine. I also have to say these labels stick really well, almost too well as I made a placement mistake on an envelope and couldn't get the label off. That sort of stick-to-it result is what you want in a label."
3,Is ok for the price,The price was ok but the quality is not perfect for the price i thing is ok so don't spect good quality.
5,Does the job and is a respected brand,"Been using Avery brand for decades and they make quality products. They can e a bit pricey, but you can always find a great deal on Amazon. Nothing fancy here - does the job like it's supposed to and works great with my inkjet printer without problems."
2,My printer won't print on these!,"I had the old ""non-easy peel"" labels and the always worked fine with my printer. I have an HP C7100 inkjet printer which has been printing faithfully for the last 3 years (not bad for a printer these days!). I am still looking for the older style labels so that I won't have to hand address our 100+ holiday cards..."
4,Great labels!,This worked smoothly and seamlessly in my laser printer as well even though they are intended for inkjet. I find that Avery and 3M (same company) always make the best labels.
4,Works As Advertised,"I gave some of these to my daughter to use in her business mailings and she really likes them. She told me they were easy to peel once printed and she had no problems getting them through her printer. She didn't try sending them through the printer multiple times, so don't know how well that would've worked"
4,Reduced my rating because the company allows a misspelling,"As labels, these are great.As lables, not so good."
5,Labels Work Great,The labels are easy to create using an ink-jet printer and easy to apply. Highly recommended.
5,Avery is always good,"The easy-peel feature makes it easier to get the labels off the sheet. You bend the page in half and then back again. The product is fool-proof. The tricky parts are doing the mail merge into the word processor.The templates come with Microsoft Word and WordPerfect. At the website they have templates for image processing software, too.If you have a specific question, make a comment and I will figure out the answer."
2,Not Sticky Enough,"I use these labels with ""Poly Bubble"" mailers to ship items. Twice in the last couple of months I've had items returned because the labels came off at some point during shipping. The mailers I'm using are brand new and have a smooth surface; there is no reason an address label shouldn't stick to them. It's possible these labels work better with paper-based envelopes and mailers, but I no longer trust these labels and am in the process of looking for an alternative."
2,Love the labels if half of them weren't wrecked,I love these labels but the package I got was way below standards. Half of the labels are unusable b/c they were ripped and bent. Not a happy customer at all. Normally I love these labels (the ones I bought in the store) but the ones amazon sent me were far below acceptable standards....
4,it did the job,It filled the state requirements and had plenty of numbers and letters. Noe if they drop the price of gas I will be able to use the boat
4,"Great for the less experienced builder, quick and easy.","I'll admit that this kit costs more than a trip to buy the pieces at the hardware store. But unless you've done it before, or are willing to risk taking multiple trips to the store for anything you forget, or buy the wrong parts, this kit makes it practically fool proof. Trust me, I've made my share of home project mistakes, but this one went smoothly thanks to the Johnson kit. Make sure you buy the right kit (height/width/door thickness) and you really can't miss with this package."
5,Perfect!,"Worked great! I paid extra for this model with the heavy-duty rollers. It's the smoothest rolling pocket door that I've ever used. I installed this by myself. I'm handy, but not a carpenter. Installation was a breeze! YouTube the instructions - made install even easier. Thanks Johnson!!"
4,Very nice product,"Very nice product. Installation was a snap. A little disappointed with the stability of the wood/metal studs; seem too flexible to me. OTHER THAN THAT, THE PRODUCT WAS PERFECT!"
3,"Read it for fun, not seriousness","The book is rather poorly written as far as books go. Some of the dialogue and action is written much like a screenplay, and in fact there is a Dinocroc movie (not available in English as far as I've found). I suspect this book was just an adaptation of the movie.There's a little bit of deception about the title of this book. The antagonist (the ""dinocroc"") in the book is a Sarcosuchus, an extinct crocodilian that is the largest known croc. So don't expect something like the Spinosaurus-looking thing on the cover - we're dealing with a very large croc, not a dinosaur.However, this is a fun book to read! If you can take your creature sci-fi cum grano salis, you'll enjoy this one. It's corny, but a good read."
2,Poor Quality,I really liked this backpack and choose it for its specific characteristics. My grandmother is a quad and needed a new one. Well after a few uses the strap came unsewed and now I have to repair it. I'm a little frustrated with the quality of the item.
1,too GREEN.,"i am just not a fan of all the green-screen...it was simply over-the-top & made the film difficult to connect with.(i really wanted to like it- i perfectly like jude law & robert downey jr!)i didn't like the magic/occult premise that made it, well, just not what i expected."
1,Sherlock Holmes Bluray,"I was slightly disappointed with this purchase. I've purchased from you guys before and I've gotten quality products but not this time. The Bluray that was sent to me was not the original Bluray that was in the box. It was a Bluray that was a rental off of Redbox, Blockbuster or some other DVD rental location. The Bluray itself says ""Rental""."
1,Stupid film:(,"Nigh-on unforgivable. An all-fumbling, all-bumbling, all-trundling crock of crud, that's not so much Snatch in a Deerstalker as bum on a flagpole."
3,The New Sherlock Holmes .....,The New Sherlock Holmes.....it takes abit getting use to the up-dated version. It's an old classic with a newer twist to it. The actors keep your attention ..... trying a little bit of comedy which I don't think works. It gets better as it goes along ..... but I wasn't really taken by this new twist on an old classic .... it is entertaining ..... A. Perry ... OregonRobert Downet Jr. .. a very talented actor ....but not very convencing in this version. Judw Law ... I liked his character........Maybe a second try this will improve.
3,Long and Boring Movie,"The stellar cast of Sherlock Holmes unfortunately can't save this Guy Ritchie directed fiasco. The plot is long and convoluted. There are some glaring inconsistencies, i.e., in two of Sherlock's fights, he choreographs how he will take his opponent down and yet with another opponent, a huge French adversary, there is no such choreography. It all so seems to go on forever."
2,Banacek meets Spiderman,My header says it all. I felt like I was watching an episode of Banacek or one of the Spiderman movies. Trying to bring Sherlock Holmes into the X-Men generation of filmmaking(?) is unsuccessful here. This is a terrible waste of two of the better actors working today. Ritchie's gimmicky style that has worked in the past comes off as hackneyed this time. The liberties taken with Sherlock's persona and general appearance were unwelcomed. Slick and witless. Bargain bin stuff in six months.
1,Elementary at best,"If you want a real Sherlock adventure, try the new BBC show. This may be one of the worst movies I've seen. If it was a movie onto its own, it might have gotten 2 stars, but it's a travesty to what Sherlock Holmes should be"
2,good but not great.,"Technical quality of movie was very good, but movie was only fair. I found the story line less than great. I felt a Sherlock Holmes movie could have provided a better story."
3,brillant,"It starts out a bit slow but then picks up, I viewed it twice and the second time around enjoyed it more than the first time. RDJ did a great job of sherlock holmes.Sherlock Holmes"
5,Great film!!!!!,This movie is definitely one to add to your collection. It is watchable over and over and endlessly entertaining!! Great cast!!! I hope they do a sequel! brillant!
3,The Rocky Road to Dublin credits,"I was delighted to hear The Rocky Road to Dublin at the end of the movie because I recognized this version by The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. When the credits rolled, The Dubliners were listed as the singers. I have The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem record, ""The First Hurrah!"" with the Clancy Brothers singing and Tommy Makem playing the tin whistle on Rocky Road. The movie credits should have listed them as the singers and not The Dubliners."
5,Great movie,Enjoyed the movie a lot. If you are a fan of action this movie has it along with great comedy
4,Good Good Good... but not so great,"I have seen this movie many times, and it was pretty cool. The acting and story line are superb, but the action is somewhat un-gratifying as each scuffle begins to feel the same. It is sometimes difficult to trace the reason for each scene, perhaps more difficult than the mystery genre would require. All around, a great movie and essential to fully enjoying its excellent sequel, but not great if you want a crazy action flick or something with a lot of re-watching potential."
4,Sherlock Reborn!!!,"I have not read any of the books, or seen any previous films, so I couldn't compare it. I thought Robert Downey Jr. pulled off an awesome performance as Sherlock Holmes and brought new life to the character. It dragged a little in the beginning, but it got a lot better. It has action, suspense, and a bit of comedy. Holmes is a brilliant detective who sometimes seems a little eccentric. Dr. Watson is his loyal assistant. Together, they try to solve a mystery as to how Lord Blackwood rose from the grave with the help of black magic, and threatens all of London. Holmes and Watson soon team up with a woman named Irene Adler who is a thief and his former adversary. If you love mysteries, you'll love SHERLOCK HOLMES!!!"
5,I love this movie,"For someone who did not grow up on the adventures of Sherlock Holmes, I am not qualified to compare this movie to any other films, tv shows, or books about this wonderful character. I can say that I think Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make up the pefect team of smarts, wits and just a dash of insanity. As soon as you think you've figured out what all is going on, there will be another twist or new piece to the puzzle added. I highly, highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves mystery, action and more comedy than what you would expect."
4,Great Fun,"This film is great fun, an afternoon or evening well spent with light entertainment. Downey Jr and Law have chemistry and play off each other well, making them a great team and amusing to watch."
2,Very dissapointed...,"I feel kind of like I'm the only one who didn't like this film! The plot was very weak, and never really grabbed my attention. Alot of times during this movie I felt my mind wandering. I think the plot was boring and tried a little too hard. The cinematography was fairly well done, the score and music forgettable. Robert Downey Jr. was fine as Holmes. I'm a Holmes fan, but not a huge, obssessed one, so I thought he was fine. But Rachel McAdams just CANNOT act. I'm sorry, but she acts the same in everything! I was expecting for this movie to be a fun, well done adventure. What I got was a boring, weak film that had no inspiration. I wonder how the sequel will be..."
2,LOVED THE MOVIE-DVD QUALITY POOR,"When I first saw this in the theatre I enjoyed it. Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law make a good team and I appreciated the fresh approach to Sherlock Holmes. However, when I bought and played the DVD on my 73 in screen I was disappointed in the video quality. The transfer suffers from obnoxious pixelation and macroblocking, making the movie un-watchable. I have recently noticed this same effect on other movies: Inception and Legend of the Guardians. I have over 1600 DVDs and all play clear and sharp except for these 3 recently released movies. While I'm not usually a conspiracy theorist, I do wonder if this an attempt to push everyone into BluRay?"
3,"Far-fetched fun, overwrought action","The Amazon summary of this movie is pretty accurate. I'll translate as, if you're from the ""less is more"" school of thought about movies, flee from ""Sherlock Holmes"" as fast as you can. Watson as a martial-arts expert? Riiight. Victorian England as a setting for a slam-bang action movie? Who would have thought? Robert Downey is Holmes and Jude Law is Watson, investigating a megalomaniac member of Parliament who is heavily into the Dark Arts and a serial killer. The acting is solid throughout, production values strong, and the plot intriguing, but the totally over-the-top action ultimately loses its punch and becomes mind-numbing. I enjoyed it anyway, but having seen the trailer beforehand, knew what to expect."
4,I enjoyed this movie very much,"It was clever, moved quickly and Robert Downey, Jr & Jude Law were great. I'll be watching the second one."
3,Sherlock Holmes,We love the Sherlock Holmes movie series and have not been disappointed by any of them at this point. Great movie!
5,Sherlock Holmes,"This is a wonderful movie, we have watched it at least 10 times since getting it from Amazon. Highly recommended."
5,great movie,great movie!!!! i was impressed. read a review on it that was not favorable at all so i didn't really care to see it. the review i read was wrong!!! the movie was excellent!
3,"Shades of Wild, Wild West","I bought the Blu-ray because:1) Sherlock Holmes2) Robert Downey, Jr.3) Guy RichieI have only watched it once and many times a second viewing will change my mind but....until then.It does not even come close to the A&E; version with Jeremy Brett.No reflection on Downey and the others. I think it all came down to the writing.Gonna watch again, though."
5,fun filled adventure!,excellent movie. Robert Downey Jr. played a perfect Holmes. All the actors and actresses were spot on. This movie really drags you into its plot. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL.
2,Not like Sherlock,"This was quite a strange and different interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. Also, the plot was kind of difficult to follow sometimes (maybe too many scenes were cut off?).In this movie, the detective was more like a modern action hero placed in the 19th century world. Jude Law was Watson in love and distracted of his role as Watson.If the producers had named this movie to detective action hero and not Sherlock then it would have been more believable."
2,sherlock holmes,"did not like this movie , nothing like the originial movies , or anything like the books.Very dark . Sir Arthur Conan Doyal would not like this movie."
2,Not the real thing,"I've read the books and seen the Ronald Howard movies.Robert Downey Jr. hardly fits my picture of Holmes at all. And tho I sometimes like Jude Law very much (as in ""The Holiday""), he made a poor Watson with the script given him.On the plus side, my wife and son liked the movie for the comedy.I'm not paying for the sequel."
4,fun movie,"pretty fun movie! good to watch on a date night, appeals to guys and girls. the sequel is great too!"
3,Much better than the trailer indicates,I was late to the game watching this film and I'm a Sherlock Holmes devotee. The trailer made this look like a gimmicky action picture similar to Transformers so I hadn't even the slightest interest in seeing it. I can only say my preconceptions were wrong. I really enjoyed the film and think they did a really good job all around.
4,great pic,great movie. bought cord to connect to tv and it plays great. I didn't get the HD version. it would probably be even bett
5,Grabs your attention from the beginnng,"Loved this movie. Love Robert Downey, Jr and Jude Law. Screenplay was well written. The story line had twists and turns that commanded your attention. Some movies drag on and you wonder when they will end but not so with this one. Well worth seeing more than once so I now own it."
3,Fun movie,"This was a fun and very unique film adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. Great actors and fight scenes.Devil's Verse: Natasha Azshatan Unlocks Ancient Mysteries, Reveals Secrets, And Wrestles With Demons As She Fights To Stay Alive"
4,Fun...Fun...Fun,One star off because of whispered dialogue throughout the movie.It drove us crazy!Other than that....lots of fun!
3,Haven't received it yet.,According to the post office it was shipped but is still in transit. It is been in transit nearly 1 month. This is the only time I have ever had a problem with an Amazon delivery.
2,Not Sherlock Holmes,This is not the Sherlock Holmes we have loved from the books. His brilliant use of logic to solve crimes appears for only about 5 minutes near the end of the film. Otherwise the character is dumbed-down to appeal to fans of Fight Club. The plot is incoherent. It's really a waste of 2 hours of your time.
2,Sherlock a mess,"Ads for the new release lured me to watch the original via Amazon. What a disappointment. First I think it was well casted and generally moved along at a quick pace, but the story line jumped all over the place, the dependence on so-so special effects wore thin real fast and worst of all, the soundtrack was awful - even though we viewed the Blu-Ray version with a good home theater setup. I will NOT be going to see the sequel."
2,Missing Dolby 5.1 in English,"Enjoyable movie, but my comments pertain to the Blu-ray disc. For some reason the studio decided to release this with English surround sound encoded in DTS only. French (and Spanish?) are encoded as Dolby 5.1, but not English. Those of us who prefer the Queen's tongue but are otherwise without DTS systems are plain out of luck. Sans DTS, we are left with Dolby Pro Logic, which is just not comparable, and on my otherwise well balanced system, sounds way too bass heavy for some reason.A real drag, though the film looks fine otherwise."
4,Sherlock Holmes Blu Ray,"I would recommend this movie. We found it ""fun"", humorous and enjoyed the plot even though it was not what we were expecting. It did flow well and kept our interest."
2,Unskippable previews means skip this Blu-ray,There are about 10 minutes of previews and stupid things that you must watch before being able to see the movie. Skip the blu-ray until they fix this. I had rented it from NetFlix.
1,"Blu-rey ""Sherlock Holmes""","Unfortunately, my DVD seemed like a pirated copy of the film I thought I was purchasing. It not only randomly would glitch and go back to certain points in the movie over and over again, but I had no access to the menu items like the extras or the chapters.I went back online to Walmart and purchased a real copy"
2,"Not what you would expect, poor","Not what you would expect from Downey, poor acting , over acting, unbeliveable shots. overall ona scale of 1 to 10(4)"
3,A CASE WORTH INVESTIGATING,Director Guy Ritchie shape-shifts the venerable British literary sleuth and his stodgy sidekick into edgy action heroes. Robert Downey Jr.'s and Jude Law's knowingly over-the-top performances and the fine production design make this case worth investigating.
4,No DVD extras?,"I loved this movie way more than I was expecting to (hey, it's Robert Downey, Jr.! what's not to love?) but I'm a bit disappointed with this DVD - whither the extras? No commentaries at all and only one blah blah blah behind-the-scenes documentary that's all of 20 minutes long (or something). Good thing I bought it off Amazon and didn't pay full price! <--say that last bit a little louder"
4,"Timely arrival and played like new, Great Movie!","DVD was as advertised, like new, and delivered in a timely manner. Love this movie! If you have read Sherlock Holmes, you will love this movie! It is great to see that the movie pegged him almost to a T! Boxing, drugs, black moods, experiments, make-up, seeing all the little details that we mere mortals look at but do not see; terrific! If you have not read Shirlock Holmes, you might be wondering why this is not like the proper English man played by Basil Rothbone. This is more upbeat, more lively, more the way I see it played out when reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. And, as a plus, you can actually see what is going on, unlike the old black and white shows with all the fog!"
2,Tried and Tried Again,"Available for a 0.99 rental, I tried to watch this one night and blamed my lack of interest on being tired because of my Christmas/NYE work schedule. I tried a second night before my rental expired, did manage to watch more of it, but it's just not clicking for me.Dear Amazon Prime: Give me more Rathbone Sherlock movies, please!"
2,No comic included....lies,Movie itself is amazing. I got this collectors edition because it was supposed to come with a comic book (I'm a sucker for comics) and a different special feature than the original. No comic came with the book and I am extremely disappointed.
2,Unhappy with this!,"I tried to cancel this order, but your software would not let me do that. You should reveiw your software."
3,Where's the beef?,"Liked the characters, but kept waiting for a story to begin. Needed more of the ""bad guy"" scenes to drive the plot. A nearly non-existant adversary makes for a simmering drama. Never pictured Holmes living in a messy apartment. First half of the film took place in grimy dark London, realistic perhaps, but not entertaining. Holmes seemed to mutter alot, eventually tiresome to have to decipher. The production values were there, the actors were there, good direction...but a thin soup of a story."
2,If you love the books skip this movie.,"It's another book to film adaption that will break your heart if you love the source material.Robert Downey Jr. played himself. Which is great usually, but Holmes is too iconic a figure for that to work this time. His love interest seems to exist primarily to dispel any jokes or even ideas that Watson and Holmes are gay, which certainly they would seem without her presence. Holmes is also not the dry, tortured and grave protagonist of the books, he's more like a spoiled child who knows he can get away with anything. Further, the plot is silly. At the core of every Holmes adventure should be empirical science (that's what makes him so brilliant), and this leans too heavily on the magical side.Somebody please ask Hollywood to stop financing Guy Ritchie already."
4,Once again Robert doesn't disappoint.,"I have become a big fan of Robert Downey Jr lately. Everything from Due Date to Iron Man 1&2, has been really good. This movie is no exception. He did a good job at bringing some humor to the character. The slo-motion shots were awesome. Can't wait to see the second one. Keep up the great work Robert."
3,Why 3 stars?,"The sound quality leaves a lot to be corrected. Great movie, Great story, and Brilliant HD quality but the sound quality is hard to put up with. It goes from so blazing loud to queit you have to adjust your volume during the movie. Really who wants to do that? they shouldn't have tried so hard on the loud end."
4,Sherlock,This is Robert Downey at his best well close there is Iron Man and Avengers all are great and I have them all
5,Awesome movie,This movie was very innovative. I remember going to see it in theaters. It was Guy Richie and Robert Downey Jr. The HD is breathtaking and the sound pounds just right through my home theater system. This is the type of movie that makes me happy I bought a blu-ray player.
5,sherlock,I remember getting this several years ago - sorry for the late thank you it was safe and sound and enjoyed
3,I expected more,I was a bit dissapointed with this movie. I typically enjoy most of Robert Downey Jr's movies but I for some reason I found this one rather boring.
2,Smashed Case,"The case was smashed to where it can't be used, I would have been fine with it if I knew the condition of the product going into it but as it were I wasn't happy with it's condition."
1,Boring!,Movie Sherlock Holmes was boring. It was too slow. Just could nto get into it. Never finished it. Wasted money.
2,"mumble, jumble, toil and too much trouble....","no matter how much I increased volume could not decipher barely a syllable from Downey, so hard to follow plot cept for the constant barrage of gun fights, fist fights, fire, explosions, chase scenes, I counted how long each frame was permitted to stay on the screen, less than 1 second for majority of film.... I wanted to take in the absolutely beautiful set decoration, attention to detail, city scapes but nope Guy won't let me and what is with that dumb crow lurching around, talk about suspense! was thinking subtitles but that would not work with the frame speed so am very dissapointed... thought the reveals were the most interesting aspect as Moriarity slipped so ever slowly (hey thanks to paperweights!) to his leap into a sequel.. I cannot recommend... have never had this much of a problem with hearing dialogue, can't comprehend how Downey intentionally played this out... sigh"
4,Fun times,A great movie. The sequel tied in nicely with this one as well. I'd recommend both movies to anyone and look forward to the third.
3,Meh...,"Honestly, I kinda expected more. I thought it'd be a bit more thrilling than it was. I mean, it was a decent movie, but definitely not one I'd own by any means. Honestly, it kinda bored me, but the parts that were exciting entertained me enough, so the boredom went down a bit. The acting was good, though! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,can not stream.,can not stream. I figured I would give amazon a go after using netflx. netflix i s clearly superior. Sherlock holmes stopped 5 times to rebuffer. did not bother to finish the movie.
3,Cleverly Done But...,"This is the first time I've ever started writing a review before the movie was over...It was all cleverly done but the question pounding the cells of my haunted mind is this: Is a watching of this really worthy any length of my time... and does it amount to any food for thought?However, I have decided to let it play to it's very end; one truly never knows before one knows it all :)"
1,Sherlock Would Be Ashamed,We are avid movie fans and this ranks among the worst movie we have watched. We turned it off after about a hour because it was so boring. At first we thought it was a spoof. It tries to be a mystery and fails. It tries to be funny and fails. The only success it had was in stupidity! Save your money!
1,Total nonsense,This is not the Sherlock Holmes I loved to watch. This was total and utter nonsense. Don't pay to watch this movie. Go watch Basil Rathbone instead because he is the true Sherlock Holmes. The 2 main actors really suck especially Robert Downey Jr.
1,DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE...Amazon purchase,"Sadly, I bought this instead of renting it! I so loved Jeremy Brett, (died at 51) as the ultimate Sherlock, that Robert Downey,Jr, never had much of a chance! That aside, it was a big snooze fest and my husband walked away after only 15 minutes into the movie! a lot of smoke and mirrors and a very weak plot. We waited several months for this to hit the DVD market. Big disappointment!"
2,Sherlock,"No more words then was slow and ponderous. sorry, sorry sorry sorrry sorrry sorry sorry no more words left at"
3,New?,"The DVD arrived in good time. When I got around to opening it, I wondered if this DVD was really new or not. It was not sealed in the same way most new DVDs are. Kind of made me wonder if someone opened it, watched it, returned it.It works fine.The movie was fun, full of twists and action. Some lines were hard to understand. I might need to put on closed caption next time I watch it :-)"
4,Good But,"First let me say it was an excellent movie, good story and graphics. My only issue and reason for 4 stars is, I must agree with another post, RDJ did mumble alot and I did miss some lines due to this."
1,Boring,"Didn't enjoy this movie at all. I could hardly stay awake, it was so boring. Very disappointed. I do not recommend it to anyone."
2,Bluray wasted on this title,"yes, we all know old England was filty. BUT...did the film makers HAVE to use a brown-wash look on the sky, foliage, faces? I can see bldgs, but come on. The film was painfully slow for me...after 1 hr, I went to bed. The 2nd 1/2 picks up and gets better. But as far as Bluray over dvd....no need to pay more for less visually..and the extras are a real snooze fest as well."
1,didn't I BUY this?!?!?!,"So I BUY this movie instead of rent it so i can copy it to my Western Digital player, but NO! It has DRM that does not allow me to play it even though I paid for it! and own it!!!!!I TRIED to be a good citizen and pay for the movie instead of illegally downloading it and I got SCREWED!FandU Amazon!"
1,Amazon selling discs with expired digital copy codes,"This is not a review for the movie, it is for the product that Amazon is selling. The Blu-Ray comes with a code for a digital copy which expired in March 2011. First off, this is ludicrous that the studios put expiration dates on the digital copies. This only encourages the use of third-party software to rip the DVD so that one can put it on a portable player. Second, Amazon should disclose that it is selling products with expired codes."
5,This movie was DEFINITELY AWESOME AND UNDER-RATED~!,"Jude Law and Robert Downey Jr. are totally awesome in this flick! It's a different take on the famous fictional detective, but it has class! There is humor and the directing and writing were fantastic! This movie should have received much more acclaim than it did. If RDJ keeps getting roles like this and pulling them off like he does, he will get a Best Actor oscar...It is long overdue, in my opinion. He has range and talent--and doesn't play the same characters again and again!"
2,Say what?,"Robert Downey looks great (nice shirts, Sherlock), but he swallows most of his hastily delivered lines and is often incomprehensible. My wife and I would turn to each other laughing after he'd spoken and then exchange gibberish in imitation of the vocally impaired detective. (I suspect that Downey, insecure about his British accent, decided to enfog most of what he was forced by the script to say.)Lord Blackstone emerges as the hero if only because he's about the only significant (male) character whose lines can be comprehended. Bring him back! In fact, give him his own franchise (and it's hard to believe this Sherlock will become one)."
5,True to book version of Sherlock and not early Hollywood,"This movie is a treat for true fans of Sherlock Holmes. The fans who have read all the books and stories and know that the real sherlock homes character was just as interesting for his vices as he was for his talent at solving crimes. Sherlock, used drugs inbetween cases and was very ""unusual"" in terms of a leading character. Its nice to see this movie get the character right for once, instead of the image many have a quiet reflective man with a funny hat and pipe. The only complaint is that I feel Jude Law was a poor choice for the character of Watson. However the gritty style of the film and the character's are more than worth a watch...you simply can't come into the movie expecting a Sherlock character that Hollywood gave us in the 20th century. Instead you should expect the Sherlock of the 19th Century...he's much more interesting to watch."
3,Holmes and Watson for the Action-Movie Crowd,"Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law make a great team in this cheerfully revisionist update of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's immortal creation. Though director Guy Ritchie's hyperkineticism occasionally falters and the heavily rewritten screenplay fails to fulfill its potential, the movie is never dull. In fact, this 2009 incarnation feels like a Victorian-era version of ""The Wild Wild West"" (and I mean that as a compliment). Downey's fitfully eccentric interpretation of the iconic detective is well-matched by Law's refreshingly non-bumbling Dr. Watson. ""Sherlock Holmes"" will not satisfy Doyle purists, but the results are jolly good fun."
3,Froze up a couple of times.,The movie was great but it froze up and skipped scenes a couple of times. It was very frustrating. I will attempt more movies in hopes that they will not freeze up.
5,Sherlock Holmes Movie,It was just an awesome movie! And I like the fact that I didn't have to go to a movie rental place or redbox to get it.
3,Sherlock Holmes,"Sherlock Holmes is a 2009 action mystery film starring Robert Downey Jr in the leading role of Sherlock Holmes. Jude Law plays the part of Doctor Watson. This is not your typical Sherlock Holmes. This is a grittier, dirtier and darker version that could have been directed by Tim Burton and played by Johnny Depp. As a strictly Sherlock Holmes film it is below par. The wit and the debonair character is sorely missing. Saving grace is the performance of Robert Downey Jr. The special effects and the costumes are quite good. Still not what I expected from Sherlock Holmes film. Since I can not give it a 2+ it ends up attaining a weak 3 out of 5. 3/5."
2,Not so good,"The movie was a convoluted mess. Rachel McAdams was awful, and the story was weak. Don't waste your time and money."
3,"Excellent Popcorn Flick, Poor Blu-Ray","The video quality is some of the best I've seen on Blu-Ray, but seriously? 16x9? Will we get the original theatrical aspect ratio in a special edition later, WB? (I can't wait to pay ~$30 for it all over again!) Maybe you were trying to give me the most pixels for my money, but I don't mind a pair of black bars if it lets me see the whole frame. Fix this nonsense and try again. Anyway it's a great movie, it'll be well worth the cash when WB gets its priorities straight. For now, I feel more than a bit ripped off.Cinema and videophiles are the ones buying Blu-Rays, and they are paying these premium prices expecting the definitive versions of the films. When are these companies going to acknowledge this?"
4,Great fun movie,This movie got some very harsh critiques but it's a fun movie. Downey and Law are great. The movie has interesting plot twists and good flow. It's not amazingly memorable but it's worth checking out.
1,3 Format RipOff!!,"The movie is great! What stinks is being force fed the 3 format edition and the inflated price!I have waited this long so I will continue to wait for the single Blu-Ray edition or that they discount the current offering!I have Blu-Ray for a reason, and do not buy standard dvd resolution dvds anymore!"
1,I only want the blu ray,"This is a great movie and I desperately want it on blu-ray. That's it, just blu-ray. I have a blu-ray player. That's why I want the blu-ray. Why would I want the DVD as well? That's right I don't. I also don't want to watch it on a phone, so I don't need the stupd digital copy that doesn't even work in other countries and even if it did it only works for a limited time then I am stuck with the useless disc in my case forever. I only want to buy the blu-ray. This really sucks."
1,Really Bad,"Terrible film.................bad music, all characters were miscast, and too much very poor cgi. The costumes were ridiculous and the sets were poorly designed and dressed. Most Holmes films are enjoyable...this one was not."
2,Could have been good if done seriously,"With fine casting, great costumes and a big budget; this COULD have been a great Sherlock Holmes movie.But it fails to deliver.Why ??It did not take the character of Sherlock Holmes seriously ......... instead this movie went for a silly, almost spoof like feel.Remember how they ruined the Wild Wild West movie ?This Sherlock Holmes film adaption looked and felt like the very bad Will Smith version of Wild Wild West."
2,Sherlock Holmes?,"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmes, it ain't. Too little reasoning, too much gratutious violence. Not bad for a Roadrunner cartoon, though."
4,Entertaining,Robert Downey did an excellent job playing the role of Sherlock Holmes. This movie will take you for a ride as Sherlock Holmes solves the mystery. I really enjoyed the two main characters interactions. The movie was visually stimulating. It was overall a very nice movie.
5,Just to be clear what you're getting!,"When I purchased this item, I wasn't totally sure what I was getting.So just to be clear, you're getting:-Blu-ray disc-DVD/Digital Copy discVERY IMPORTANT!At this point, the code for the digital copy is EXPIRED! So if you're specifically looking for the digital copy, you're unfortunately out of luck."
5,Blu-ray Sherlock Holmes,"Great movie, received very quickly, brand new never opened. I would shop here again. Everything was a great experience. Thanks"
3,"Hooray for Holmes, all of the wonderful actors who were Holmes.",I guess I'm old school still love the Basil Rathbone Sherlock best. This is good but I collect old movies and not too many new ones. I was disappointed in Holmes but loved the atmosphere of London.
3,Lots of action...story development weak,"The filming and acting were good in this movie, but it was more fighting and less thinking/development than I expected. I never was really captivated by the film...always felt I could walk away because I never was pulled into the story."
5,Wicked modern spin on the classic stories,"I was pleasantly surprised at this modernized version of the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. It was nice to see lines or snippets from Doyle's stories make their way into the movie. The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law is wonderfully subtle; the scene with the pair awaiting bail was snicker worthy but also showed the pair's brotherly affection. Don't expect this movie to hold hard and fast to Doyle's stories but know that this movie does pay homage to Doyle's famous sleuth by dropping actual lines from the tales which the characters either speak or situations they comment on. Sit back, relax, enjoy this film, then go read the Sherlock Holmes stories. You won't be disappointed. Cheers!! }:O"
3,A new twist,I real good remake of an old story. I seen this in theater and really enjoyed it. I purchased this as a gift for Christmas for a family member.
5,good movie,"Even though I thought I lost my original copy,I still like this movie. I'll give my girlfriend one of them."
3,Not bad,I must admit when I was a little boy my first taste of the Sherlock movies were with Basil Rathbone so no matter who plays the part I always in the back of my mind compare them with that version of Sherlock and to this day he's my favorite actor for that particular role. I read most of the original Sherlock Holmes books years ago so Robert Downey Jr's version took a lot getting used to. I think he plays a pretty good version of Holmes in his own way but it took some adjusting with how quickly he explained things throughout the film.
5,"Great Movie,","I've been wanting to watch this for awhile. I'm not a big movie watcher, and there are few that catch my interest enough to rent and actually watch much less buy. This is one that will probably make it into my permanent library. Enjoyed every minute, and will be anticipating watching the sequel. As noted, I seldom sit through an entire movie...but I did this one..with few pauses :-).And I watched it on my new Galaxy Tab. :-)"
2,Why is Holmes an action hero?,"Why is Sherlock Holmes an action hero? Isn't he supposed to be a detective?!I simply couldn't grasp the plethora of action scenes in what is supposed to be a detective film. I'm not saying it should be boring, but turning Sherlock Holmes into Rambo is just ridiculous. The entire first 40 minutes are composed of actions scenes. This is typical Guy Ritchie nonsense.I expected an intricate, tense and mysterious detective film with plot changes that would make your head spin - after all that is what Sherlock Holmes is all about - but all I got was Rambo with a bit of detective skills. I would definitely not recommend this. Rent it once and forget about it - shouldn't be too difficult!"
2,What? And Please Tell me What is good about this movie???,"Ok, finally got around to watching this. Understand it did well at box office but watching it, I don't get the attraction. The pacing is terrible, special effects just ok, plot??? I would not recommend to anyone. Sure hope second one is better than this turkey."
2,Sratches on DVD,The movie played most of the way through but there were several spots that it skipped. Kind of disappointed since it said that the DVD was in good shape.
2,Matted Widescreen?,"It is 2010 and they release Matted Widescreen on DVD? What is this??? Movie is great, but I'm not gonna buy Blue Ray Player just because of that. Very low marketing from WB."
1,Well it was action packed,"Tony Stark as Sherlock Holmes is boring. One review mentioned that Holmes in the books did have martial arts training and had *once* been a prize fighter. All well and true but these things were not the basis behind the stories where they are center stage of these movies (this one and the apparent sequel).If you're interested in an action packed super hero Sherlock Holmes this is the movie for you. If you were expecting a well crafted film, a la Chaplin, with action sequences, you will be disappointed. I know 1 star seem harsh for a harmless action movie and I did see the previews. The problem is I was able to rent this for free, didn't have high expectations and still couldn't sit through it. This means, at least to me, that it was a truly bad movie and that Guy Ritchie is a one trick pony. I suggest, if you like Guy Ritchie, just re-watch Snatch."
2,"Disappointing, couldn't understand them.","Very disappointed, not much of a story and couldn't understand Downey's accent, had to use the closed caption."
2,Obnoxious blu ray limitations,I very strongly recommend against buying the bluray version of this disk. It prohibits skipping through all the adds and trailers at the start of the disk forcing you to wait through 5 to 10 minutes of crud.
1,This movie = anti intelligence,"Sherlock Holmes is about using his miraculous brain to solve crimes. That is his one and only resource. In this movie, Sherlock Holmes is ripped, can fight anyone, and oh yeah sometimes solves crime. Would have been a much better movie if the characters names were not Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. Garbage"
2,I do not know about this?,I found the movie lost something. You cannot make a movie good with alot of action scenes. There has to be some substance and believe-ability..this movie failed by my thinking. LOVE the actors hated the movie...BUT the price was reasonable as always on Amazon...
3,Movie is really good but no subtitles,"We rented this movie because we love it, and wanted to watch it with our parents, who are a little elderly.Print was clear, but it had no subtitles; so our parents didn't really follow the movie.Hence the 3 stars"
3,It's alright,Y'knahmsayin? (Do You Know What I'm Saying?) Y'knahmean? (Do You Know What I Mean?)Y'knahmsayin? (Do You Know What I'm Saying?) Y'knahmean? (Do You Know What I Mean?)I went to see part two and I fell asleep but it had some interesting parts. I liked the cinemotgraphy. It was new and innovative. I decided to watch part one and I see why people believe it to be a long 4 hour continuation.
2,Why do this to Holmes?,"Why do this to Holmes? Not in the spirit of Holmes at all. See Jeremy Brett (classic) and the newSherlock Seasons I and II with Cumberbach (?) if you want a ""modern"" Holmes. This oneis using the standard slam-bam violent movie techniques of today and pasting Holmes'name on it. Also tasteless= the image of a nude fat Mycroft was a turn off,particularlyfor my wife."
2,Slow Movie,"Interesting but to slow for me. About an hour in I was looking at the time going ""really another hour of this still"". The case he's on is pretty strange too. It deals with a satanic priest who comes back from the dead and all kinds of strange things."
2,not worth the time or the money,"If you are looking for a Basel Rathbone/Nigel Bruce kind of Sherlock Holme's story, this will be a disappointment."
5,The Power of Attraction,"They're so small and innocuous-looking in the package. But open 'em up, get 'em near an appliance and BAM! Those little suckers slammed onto the Frigidaire with such force that I was genuinely startled. They're so tiny that my husband has trouble prying them up with his big, meaty fingers. As magnets go, they come highly recommended. Obviously not for the wee ones who haven't yet learned not to stick inedible objects in their various orifices."
2,Making up your own mind Book,This book was nto waht I expected. I was looking for a story book to read to a child and it is not that.
1,It MISSED the most IMPORTANT songs...,"I thought such a collection would be amazing- Madhuri, Aishwarya (& Rekha) are the three most amazing faces and talented dancers to be in Bollywood and yet this DVD missed on movies as essential as Tezaab, KalNayak, Dil To Pagal Hai when it came to Madhuri. How can one compose a set of her work and not include these! And for Aishwarya, how can one forget her work in Hum Dil De Chuke? These movies had some wonderful dances - I had hoped that this collection would be made of such masterpieces. But, it's nothing close to a collection."
1,Expensive Rip Off,"Like the vast majority of Monster cables, this is just over priced. There is not difference between the quality of signal of this cable and a 5 dollar cable."
5,Super Sound,You get a super crisp sound. By up grading from my old Bozaks to the JBL was like turning on a new receiver. Great speakers for the money you don't need to spend a lot for great sound. I love them.
1,duped,"Buyer beware, when this item arrives you will receive one bar of soap not six as stated in the ad- not sure if the ad was in error or a deceptive ad, will not buy from this vendor again.Diana Green"
1,Very Drying ...,"This is NOT very moisturizing soap. I bought a bunch of the 3-pack boxes on another website when they were on sale, and I regret it.If you need a soap that moisturizes your skin, try South of France.I will never buy this brand again.Marigold Oil? The ""marigold oil"" does nothing. There's prolly just ONE drop in the entire bar.The soap does last a long time. But in this case, that's not a good thing. I just want to use it up, and be rid of it!I'll never buy this again."
5,"excellent resource, highly recommended","Finding My Way offers an in-depth look at the dynamics of responding to grief. The author takes seriously the inevitabilities of change, loss, and subsequent grief; and also conveys the hopeful possibilities for growth and transformation that grief invites. The book is rich in description and analysis and, at the same time, very respectful of the deeply individualistic journey through grief. In my work as a grief educator, I like and use the authors helpful discussion of grieving as a discovery process: discovering what is lost, what is left, and what is possible. This is a book I return to often, both professionally and personally."
2,Yuck,"Low budget violent blood fest. There, I've said most of it. Urban locations, probably Los Angeles warehouse district etc. Scanty FX. Seeing once is enough."
2,Runs Out of Steam,"The special effects are good to great. The acting and the characters are also good to great. However, the movie runs out of steam as the end approaches, and many plot threads are left unresolved and unexplained. The movie ends with a dull, boring whimper. No explanations, no real climax. It is almost a three-star movie. I would watch it again knowing its limitations.Paul Logan is perfect as the Terminators; you don't think a movie called ""The Terminators"" would have just one Terminator, do ya? A. Martinez is also perfect as the Sheriff; he is strong and calm and protective of the others. The various female characters are more heroic than any of the young males, though the movie has far too many major-minor characters.The ""Filmmakers' Commentary"" track is people having fun talking about the movie. It is almost worth another star."
1,Ugh,"I knew going into this that it wouldn't be a great movie. I expected a B-movie but instead was 'treated' to a D-movie. Honestly, I had high hope with the decent cast and cool looking cover (though all they do is clone the same robot image over and over). Very misleading though. What I got was nonsensical action, a choppy plot, aweful story and fairly bad acting. The special effect make Ray Harryhausen""s work look smooth and refined.I wish I could find some redeeming qualities but I can't. It is a poor attempt to cash in on current hot trends and Terminator: Salvation which just came out. If I can keep you from wasting 90 minutes of your life and $5, then I'll have done you a service that I wish someone had done for me. Avoid!"
1,How do you put a (negative) -5 star rating,"This has got to be the worst movie of all time. Acting sucked, special effects sucked, dialog sucked. I mean, this movie sucked big time. Don't waste your money or your time. The person that rated the movie with 5 stars needs to be in a funny-farm. Something wrong with you dude...Don't buy this movie. Don't even watch it on late night TBS. It really does suck. I'm just trying to figure out how I can get my 2 hours back that I wasted in my life watching this trashed out movie."
3,"Honestly,Its Just THAT Damn Kewl !","Theasylum has done it again with a great cast: Jeremy London,A Martinez and Paul Logan.Terminators is solid sci-fi action and pulls no punches in any respect.The characters are natural,and never let us down as far as a moving plot goes.Paul Logan(Ballistica) as our AHNULD robot is fitting and carries the menace thru-out.Jeremy London(7th Heaven) comes into picture late,But really saves the day with a spiffy rifle and tech knowledge that brings more science into The fiction plot.A Martinez(One Life To Live),Where have you been ? Does this journeyman hero turn with a secret.Lots of violence by Logan,And some great effects in outer space."
5,Someties you do get what you pay for,"I'd beg to differ on the other reviews.I used this cable for field recording (concerts) for 5 years with no problems until recently, it takes alot of abuse from being used outdoors, indoors at bars and clubs, constantly being disconnected and reconnected, spooled up in a bag, etc.I bought a ""noname"" brand replacement and it did not fit securely in my equipment and stopped working completely within the first time I used it!My use for this cable demands that I don't have a piece of junk for one of the most critical components of my rig.I look forward to getting another good quality cable that will last another 5+ years, even if it comes with a slightly higher price tag."
1,The new Pet Rock,"There is legitimate debate about the value of high-end ANALOG audio cables. However there is NO data showing ANY difference between a $5 Toslink and one of these Monster-Priced ones. If you find the bulkier Monster more attractive, be my guest!"
5,FAVORITE Diffuser EVER!!!,I owned a similar diffuser by a different brand and it eventually broke. I looked EVERYWHERE for the same diffuser and couldn't find it. Then I stumbled upon this one and it's practically identical. I have naturally curly hair and will never be without this diffuser! Love it!
2,what does this fit on?!,"all the fittings are too small for any hair dryer. I bought this diffuser and found that even the largest one didn't fit on my dryer, so I went to the store to buy a new hair dryer and could find one that would fit for under $150! why on earth would someone make an adaptable diffuser with such tiny fittings. what a sick joke! I actually do like the diffuser though, but Ive been having to hold it onto my dryer with a towel wrapped around the attachment part, and it's such a pain, but I like how it dries my hair otherwise I'd just buy a hair dryer with custom diffuser. I'll have to go to home depot and try to figure out a way to fit it to my dryer, but wow, bad design on the adaptable parts. wouldn't go through this trouble again."
4,far better than the norm for the 'humorous science fiction' genre,"A prospective reader should understand that this is a work of genre fiction, even a work of sub-genre fiction. If you don't care for humorous science fiction, you're not likely to enjoy this book. That said, the characterization of Oliver Vale, the protagonist, is strong and empathetic, and the plot is established by truly original developments. One almost can't help but feel sorry for this man, raised by a mother who had suffered so much, forced into the center of a global aliens-and-reincarnation crisis.That said, the characters other than Oliver Vale are paper-thin and the resolution (which I won't reveal here) is conventional, so four stars only from me."
3,"A strange, quirky story","A strange, quirky story of how one man, Oliver Vale, saved the world. All Mr. Vale wanted to do one night was watch a John Wayne western, but up pops this feed from Ganymede of Buddy Holly wanting help and Oliver Vale is the only one who can help him. It is never explained how he may be helpful or what Mr. Vale could do, but he was named and his world became quite chaotic. The only thing he thinks that he can do is travel to Mr. Holly's hometown and final resting place, Lubbock, Texas. On the way he gets an entourage: the Bald Avenger, Gretchen, Boog, Ringo, Cathy and Jeremy, etc. He and some of his cohorts are about to be pummeled when he saves the day. Whew!!! it was a close call, then everything turned out better and life went on.The story is a joke and some of the situations are really silly, but it is a very good story."
5,Cables are the key,"This cable gave me huge improvement in picture quality, espcially from DVD. The connectors are of a good quality and I think that this cable is worth every cent"
4,Back to normal,"...or what passes for normal in Estarcion. There's a little something for everyone here: the real Suentius Po explaining the history of Iest, Illusionism, his reincarnations, and all the other Suentius Pos. The ""real"" Regency Elf versus the fake Regency Elf. The Judge versus Death. The Judge versus his evil twin. Cerebus versus the Cirinists. Punisheroach versus the Cirinists. More trippy ""mind game"" art. If you want to read Cerebus, you really need to start with volumes 1, 2, or 5, unless you're really into F. Scott Fitzgerald or Ernest Hemingway (who show up in later volumes), so this one won't make much sense without volumes 1-5 under your belt."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Revolution abounds. Cerebus gets mad at Cirinists, kills a bunches, has a little revolution that fails. The Roach turns into the Punisher, which is pretty funny, and does his own revolution thing."
2,.,"In a sense, it was nice to see some adrenaline pumped into Cerebus after the low-key ""Jaka's Story"" and ""Melmoth,"" -- the action is entertaining, the story is interesting, and the humor is pretty rich. Well -- at least at first. But Flight (and the rest of Mothers & Daughters) quickly begins to suffer from the scattershot feel and pretentious, self-important meanderings of the earlier Church & State II, which I consider the worst book of the first 6. Sim has no focus here, and jumps around, shifting from wacky comedy to heavy-handed drama to boring historical ramblings indiscriminately. In Flight, I no longer felt immersed in a particular, cogent world of Sim's creation -- I felt like I was just watching him sort of ... make stuff up ... ramble off on bizarre historical details that I felt no connection to as a reader ... and so forth. Flight has its moments, but it really marks the point at which my interest in Cerebus as a whole began to radically taper."
3,The Worst Cerebus to Date,"This is the last Cerebus tale I have read and my least favourite to date. Its not bad, but its not of the same quality that I have come to expect from Dim Sim, who is one of the most under-rated creaters in comics. I liked the scenes with the roach, but the bits with Cerebus in it seem to go on forever. Unlike, say Jaka's Story, which is also quite drawn out, its just not that interesting. This instalment basically follows Cerebus's meeting with some kind of Ardvark ancestor who has acheived god-like status. It is also basically setting the scene for a confrontation between Cerebus and Cirin, who seems to be becoming the main antagonist in the series. I am not suggesting that you skip this book, however. It is, of course, an integral part of the overall storyline. Just don't expect too much from it."
1,I'm Looking For The CD changer function,"This album is complete tripe. He can't sing or dance. Still, Germany owes a huge debt to this man. If it wasn't for him getting up on the Berlin wall to sing a song, it may have never been knocked down!"
3,"Easy read, well supported with examples","The book is an easy read. Liked the approach as a dialogue between the Guru and the student. Very well supported with examples of horoscopes. I would consider this book as an advanced reading. Not sure if someone that is new to Vedic Astrology would benefit as much.Reader be cautioned that several concepts mentioned here may be in contradiction to the fundamentals of Vedic Astrology as taught by the great sages and their works such as Brihat Parasara Hora Shastra etc. The author is very open about his disagreements with the views of the great sages and historic works.Perhaps the author's experience in applying the fundamentals of vedic astrology in real life may have led him to deviate from the core principals such as 'Vargottama' planet etc. Interestingly several of his observations seem to apply very well in some cases. Looks like the author may be on to something, perhaps discover some new approach for astrology."
1,Cover was torn,The book cover was torn and I had to ship it back. Unfortunately. Waste of time and money. Did not have a good experience.
5,The quintessential Resients album,"Amazon sadly does not include this seminal band in their list of ""Essentials"" artists, but if they did, Duck Stab would top the list. It was made right at the apex of their creativity, so their earlier weirdness has been refined and the later blandness hasn't kicked in yet. It's also their least ""conceptual"" album, being simply a collection of a dozen or so three-minute songs. It's plenty ""weird"", as all Res albums are, but it never crosses the line into outright ugliness, as their ""Third Reich"" album does. The lack of a concept also helped keep them from falling into self-indulgence as happened a few times on other albums.Anyway, if you don't like this one, you probably just won't like the Residents ever. And if you can't get yourself to like the Residents, well, then God help ya."
3,a good little album,"This is definitely one of their best albums, it has nice tunes, more silly voices and quare instrumentation. A lot of these songs rock quite hard, like constantinople which builds itself up to an intense climax. Booker tease is a nice little instrumental with electric guitar and saxophone. Blue rosebuds is one of the best songs on the album, and contains the phrase 'their finest flowers' which is one of their album names. Electrocutioner is perhaps the most unsettling song, it has very agitated vocals but also it has a lovely,calming end. The songs are all very unusual but never too difficult to listen to. If you like 'weird' music like this you should also dig the likes of Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. Chances are that you already do! Thank you"
2,Expected more,"Shantell Powell's review is very thorough, however, I have to deduct points for the very poor production values compared to other instructional DVDs at similar prices. The amount of actual demonstration and information in this DVD is very small in contrast to the extensive ren faire footage, much of which adds little to the teaching. The instructors themselves, in particular Cory Zamora, are good and pass on useful information. One can condense the useful material in this DVD to about 20 minutes at the very most--helpful, but really not worth scanning through the whole DVD more than once. The few demo sections at least are shot so that the viewer can see the entire body. I really expected more, particularly based on the previous reviews. I own about 25+ instructional bellydance DVDs. This one is probably at the bottom of the stack. I really wanted to like it more but I have to be fair."
4,good,They explain technique and have demostrations and also performances. The volume was not too good.
2,Pathetic & Porous White Board,"Non-intuitive instructions. Also, dry erase side stained permanently with the first use of it. We used a dry erase marker, then used a dry erase eraser and finally sprayed it with EXPO2 White Board Cleaner which is specific for all dry erase surfaces and the stain still DID NOT come off. My husband and I then tried to use washable markers on it and it does wipe off clean with a damp cloth but ONLY if you wipe it within 60 seconds or less. Those markers stain on this surface as well which is odd b/c the same washable markers wipe clean from our wooden floors and walls. This ""white board"" is extremely porous!! We have yet to try the chalk side, but we have no high hopes for that either. This product was a gift--thank goodness we didn't waste any money on it. Stay clear of this product."
1,Appallingly poor quality,"This product is very cute and we were excited to receive it as a 2nd birthday gift for our child - however it was absolutely impossible to put together. Pilot holes were drilled so imprecisely that the pieces we did get together were crooked. Critical pieces of support wood were warped so they could not be used. The wood is so cheap that the screws stripped right through as they were being put in. This product will be returned after 2 adults spent 1.5 hours trying to put it together without success.I am appalled at the poor quality of this product and am horrified that the gift giver spent over $50 on it. Please, save yourself the headache of returning it and just don't buy it in the first place."
4,Creative and Functional Design - Even with some improvement required on assembly construction.,"When together, this board is sturdy, functional and looks fantastic. My 5 year old girl got this for Christmas and uses it on a daily, if not hourly, basis. It is standing height for her and the white board and chalk board (black painted surface) work perfectly.I'll have to admit that the construction was a little hap-hazard for tolerances and alignment, but with a little thought and effort, it comes together and is quite sturdy.It's the best looking easel on the market for kids... just needs a little quality improvement when it comes to assembly.I'd give it 5 stars if the assembly issues and instructions were worked out, but if I ever need another one, I'd buy this one again."
1,Not Satisfactory,"I ordered this product when it was on sale for $50 thinking I was getting a deal from the regular price of over $100, but I was very disappointed when the easel arrive. The legs were scratched all over including one leg being cracked. In addition to that, the product is very cheaply made. The writing inserts were flimsy and the holder for markers was dirty and chipped. Certainly not worth the $50 I paid and certainly not worth the $100+ regular price. I will be returning it and looking for something different."
3,Mixed Review,"My feelings are mixed on this product. It arrived very quickly, however, I was a bit disappointed in the quality. One of the yellow boards that holds the tray together was split on both ends, which prevented us from being able to attach it to the other boards with the provided screws... so we had to end up using wood glue. One of the pencil posts also had a rather large crack running down the side. The chalkboard is not at all what I expected in terms of material. It does NOT feel like a chalkboard, it's almost like paint. Aside from those issues, the product is super cute, and very sturdy once put together. If my little sister weren't so hard on things, I probably would have returned this product for a more expensive, better quality easel. Overall, it is an ""ok"" purchase."
4,Quality labels,"Avery is the standard for computer printed labels, and have been for years. These laser labels print well, don't smear, and stick well to envelopes.Why did I give them a 4* review? Because I think this new ""Easy Peel"" label is a solution looking for a problem. I've labeled thousands of envelopes (I sell real estate and send out mailers on a regular basis), and I never had a problem with the old style label.These ""Easy Peel"" labels have a line where you fold the paper and the edge of the label sticks out making it easier to peel off. When I tried this, the top labels stuck out fine, but the sheet didn't quite fold on the line so the bottom labels didn't stick out as well. I'm not sure that taking the time to fold the sheet 3 times to peel off the labels actually saves any time.I haven't done a major mailer with these labels yet, but I think the regular Avery labels are just as good."
2,Easy-peel feature not worth the extra charge,"Compared with the same size Avery labels of different spec, you pay more than twice for this easy-peel feature per label.Avery Easy Peel White Mailing Labels for Laser Printers, 1 x 2-5/8 Inches, Box of 3000 Labels (5160). The easy-peel feature is simply a strip-away of remaining pieces on the paper. It then offers you "" Pop-up Edge for fast peeling"". I don't think it is worth the extra charge at all. Go get the basic one. You will be very happy with it."
4,Good solid labels - easy peel feature a good improvement!,"These are good, standard solid labels from Avery - template suggestions are always on the package (so helpful) and I've used both the 3M version, Avery version, and branded store versions (like Office Depot) - they all work well as address labels - if you are wondering how to choose, I'd make your decision based on price, and features such as the Easy Peel (which makes using a LOT of these go much faster - think Christmas card mailings, wedding/shower invitations, etc)...as well as other features like (is it for a LASER or INKJET) printer? Is it the right adhesive (does it stick well enough to the type of envelopes or packages you are using)...I would recommend this product from Avery - price and a few other features will help you make a quick decision between this & other brands, but Avery has been making good labels for a long time, so I would choose Avery where I could - I like their continuous improvement process!"
3,Avery Labels just a little bit old,Labels seem to be ok in spite of the fact that Avery places a shelve life of 2-3 years. These labels had a brochure enclosed for a contest that expired 10 years ago. They were worth the price so far.
4,Avery Address Labels,"Avery makes some really great products. It's certainly a name you can trust. These labels work great for my needs. I also love the available downloads from the Avery website. I've had nothing but a pleasant experience with this item and getting the job done.The price seems to be pretty reasonable. I would also like to add that the price on Amazon is, I think, a little bit cheaper than what I have paid in the past at a couple of different office supply stores (not to mention any names)."
4,Works with Canon,These are easy to use and I only had to use 2 sheets of plain paper to get them aligned. It works fine with my cannon printer but I prefer to put them in 1 at a time. I didn't have a problem with these but I one had a problem with the printer taking more than one sheet then it wanted to jam.I like the size they are big enough to clearly see the address but not too big to take up too much space.I several pages with return addresses and I will save some for addressing envelopes at Christmas time.
3,3.5 stars... :o),I loved it rather good book a lot to bare for a twenty year old I very much enjoy the follow up book to their story i actually cried at the end first time reading this author.
3,not fit for me.,"I can't say that this story was bad, becasue it wasn't... It just didn't fit my style. I know that much. I would reccommend this book to someone else but I know I won't be reading it again."
3,Just OK.,"Byrd, I love your books, but you let me down on this one. ""I Promise"", has excellent characters & story line. I just wished, you did not save the last 50 pages for the best part of the book, then leave the readers wanting more. Don't get me wrong, it is excellent to see romance w/ someone w/ imperfections (thats life)."
2,ok but not GREAT!,"I liked the story especially the beginning. All through the book I kept wondering ""What is wrong with this girl"". Of course you don't find out until the end what she has gone through (going through) and why she pushes men away. I thought it quite unbelievable that a man would knowingly kiss his twin brother's girl especially since she has told him she wants to end the relationship (with his brother)???This story was ok but not as good as the other's report."
1,This book was a MESS!!,"This book was unfocused and unbelievable. The characters and story line was all over the place. I found myself wondering several times, ""What are these people thinking? And this just seems too out there to be believable"". I previously thought A. Byrd was a good writer, but after buying and reading this book, I question whether I will ever buy one of her books again."
3,Trublock Technology,"Trublock Technology is a gray coating on the adhesive side of the label so that it is more opaque and covers what is underneath. If this is important to you than it's an added bonus. Otherwise, not an essential quality."
3,"Correct product, high price","Yes, this is what I needed, but when you add in the cost of shipping (7.99), it is not worth it. There is no way in the world that it cost almost eight dollars to send this. I won't buy them again and just wait until I get to a city to stock up."
5,This labels are a must for those who like to recycle packaging,"I give these labels my highest recommendation as I like to recycle packaging (envelopes, boxes, plastic mailers) and they are sufficiently thick so that you only need one to cover up any addresses, codes, instructions that would ordinarily make it hard to reuse packaging. Even if you tend not to be a person who recycles, these will serve you well in case you need to return a purchase using the same package that it came in.Easy to peel and can be used for addressing using computer software or just as good to peel off and write over them by hand. Priced reasonably and there is little else to say about ""labels."" If you need them, these are as good as it gets for the reasons highlighted above.If you use labels exclusively for mailings on new envelopes, you might be able to save a few dollars and buy another Avery product that has more labels for a similar price."
3,Good for the price...passable,"All 3 films here were entertaining and definetly worth the price you can find them for on amazon.Patrick and Thrist being the best out of the 3 with great atmosphere.Strange behavior was a fun ride through campville having one scene at a halloween party where the actors actually bust out singing and dancing towards the camera like in a musical ,not sure what they were going for with that,but it was amussing.All movies here are worth seeing at least once.My 3 stars here are also for the price,as while these are passable the're hardly worth any price above 10 bucks"
1,Another overpriced digital cable!,"Let me start by stating that I have nothing personal against Monster Cable. While they do make some nice cables, in some cases they offer no real benefit over inexpensive alternatives. The best example is digital cables. Anyone familiar with IEEE 1394 (otherwise known as I-Link or Firewire) should know that there is built-in error correction that can deal with any small amount of noise introduced into the digital stream. Since this corrects any minor errors, there is NO difference in quality between an adequate digital cable and an outstanding one.Do yourself a favor and purchase an inexpensive Firewire cable for as little as ... instead of wasting your money on the ... version. Out of respect for ...I am not going to tell you where to purchase, but any resourceful shopper should be able to find them using the search engines.Now analog cables.....that's a whole different story :-)"
4,This is a unique book...,"... in that it introduces young cooks to the many different cusines around the world. Some of the recipes, like the sushi, may be difficult for a very young child but those are easily avoided with the raiting system next to each recipe. Also, adults can help kids with the hard parts. This book is a lot of fun!"
1,Flav is nothing without Chuck,"During his long and successful career with Public Enemy, Flavor Flav aided the powerful Chuck D. with his crazy antics. However, this single proves that he is nothing without the great Mista Chuck. Personally, I believe that ""Git On Down"" is one of the worst songs ever recorded. If you want quality Flavor Flav, listen to Public Enemy. But dont turn to this."
1,Not for Blu ray,"This converter does not work for Blu ray drives. BIOS and Vista Ultimate immediately recognized it, but when I put in a Blu ray movie it NEVER played!"
3,"It works, but not as advertised","Running this adapter on an Intel D945GCLF2 with a Cavalry 64GB SSD. When using 80 conductor IDE cables (ATA-100 on my board), I experienced severe data read issues. As soon as I switched to a UDMA-33 cable (40 conductor), the drive reads were fine. This adapter is rated at ATA-100/ATA-133, but don't you believe it! That said, even at UDMA-33, performance is acceptable, and I purposely went for the cheap adapter & SSD drive. BTW, the SSD drive performed marvelously on a SATA port - Windows Storage Server 2008 desktop loaded in just under 4 seconds after reboot and logon... =0"
1,This adaapter did not work for me.,"I bought the adapter to use on a Seagate 7200.9 SATA 200G disk installed in a Dell Dimension 4550 with an Ultra ATA 100/133 controller. The Seagate disk was not the boot disk. On boot, the Windows XP screen would show, followed by a completely dark screen for a couple of minutes, followed by a Blue Screen of Death with a hardware error. Fortunately, the kit contained a SATA data cable (not sure why), so I installed the Seagate drive in a different computer on my LAN that had a SATA controller."
1,It didn't work for me.,"I erroneously bought a SATA hard drive and then bought this converter to adapt it to my IDE motherboard. Well, it didn't work. In the end I ended up returning the hard drive and purchasing the correct one. On a good note: The converter did ship quickly and at only $15, wasn't worth the cost of returning. I just consider it a ""dumb move"" fine."
5,"Sound basic principles, easy to use diagnostic charts","Very good topic coverage, easy to use and understand, caters for apprentices at variety of entry levels. Should have a broader brand name base"
5,Faith of our Father,I am very pleased with this purchase. The DVDs were what I expeceted them to be.
3,Nice but not one of my favorite pieces,"This is a stand alone as it is not to scale to the rest of the Halloween village. The sound quality is just okay. It sounds as if it is coming from an old tape recorder. Perhaps that was intentional?The Toccata is classic Halloween though and the added sound effects and the organ ""player"" are amusing. Kids seem to love it."
5,An accessible and mind-opening journey.,"I found 'Our Oriental Heritage' changed the way I looked at the world. I think it helped break me out of a parochial, anglocized paradigm of our society. I also think that the book illustrates that many universal truths transcend notions of class, race, time, and geography (although not necessarily gender). Also, I cannot overstate Durant's sense of humor and beautifully simple style."
5,"Very efficient, useful tool.","I love LS120 Superdisks. I have never liked Zip drives, because of some compatibility problems. And the inconvenience of the drive. I replaced my 3.5 in. floppy drive with an internal LS120 Superdisk, as they are capable of reading 3.5 in. floppies as well. They even have more space than the Zip-100. Very convenient, and extremely simple to use. The only problem is: I can't find them anywhere lately. I can't find the blank media, or additional drives either."
2,Dull,"Dull, slow-paced, and not very entertaining. I would not recommend it to others. The screenplay could use substantial re-writing to tell the story in a convincing and compelling manner,"
1,Los Terribos!!,"Saw this movie on Netflix, but they took it out of they're library. This movie was so dry and poorly directed,scripted,and the production value is very poor. The characters had no life to them. The women character is a lonely crack whore that really doesn't put up any kind of struggle while these guys are in her house. It also put down Mexican minority race... I kinda took it offensive. I would steer clear of this. It looks like a Craigs list piece of crap."
2,didnt live up,"i think the first 4 levellers cds are something great. they have their own unique sound and heart to each one of them. On this cd they try and go back to basics but dont really live up to the old cds. I did get to see them live this year and they were great, mostly because they played old songs. This cd for me didnt land on the mark."
2,love one song on the album,i bought it for one song. one frigging song not available on any of her albums thats niki the backup singer for madonna who ironically sings amazingly better then madonna. the rest of the songs are good but i would go popping it in the cd player for drive in the car. no thats reserved the murphys boys.
3,the big green,i like the review but i was wondering if anyone knew who the artists were that sung some of the songs. That would be very helpful.
4,An original idea,"These poems about the lives of different insects are meant to be read by two voices, thereby mimicking the sounds or characteristics of those bugs. The book works rather well, especially the whirligig beetle poem. Appearing in bookstores nation wide in 1992, I remember being given this book at the age of 10 from my mother. At that particular age I was not interested in participating in a picture book, clearly designed for younger students. Had I received it at a younger age I think I would have liked it more. I would recommend presenting this book to a group of students, having them perform it together. That would be the best use of this singular text."
4,Mostly great . . .,"These poems about insects are each written as two parallel ""parts,"" and are designed to be read aloud by two people at once. This idea is great; to see the general principle carried to another level, check out Fleischman's ""Big Talk"" for four voices.One small caveat: In the poem on honeybees, a worker bee describes its life as ""hell."" Can't say I much appreciated that."
4,Shame this book isn't used more in classrooms today,"I listened to this on audiotape, then I read the poems, and then I listened to the audiotape again. It's amazing to hear the poems read aloud, in two voices, converging, diverging, making a strong statement by reading a line in unison. The poems are all about insects. The illustrations are lovely pen-and-ink drawings. I want to get the audiobook for my library and find a way to use it with the students."
3,Short and sweet,"The poems are fun, and my 9th graders enjoyed reading them. The only problem is the selection is too limited--there are too few poems in the book! Guess I will have to get the next one."
5,Great poems for two voices,I read poems for two voices.There are animal poems.They are great poems for two voices.I liked the poems.
5,What a great book!,"This is a collection of beautiful short poems for children about a variety of insects. The children are supposed to read the poems together as if it were a dialog or play and the interplay of words is supposed to fit with the type of insect the poem describes. The book, illustrated by Eric Beddows, won the 1989 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature."
4,Judith Furedi strikes a chord with Lennon fans.,"This is a book full of pure creation. This is a concept that Lennon himself would have loved. The creative process that Ms. Furedi has started here with her very strong poetry is not done after the work is published, to say the least. The reader is asked to join in this process to finish the book in any way they see fit. There are blank pages inserted throughout for the readers input, be it writing, drawing, photographs or any other form of self expression. The intent is for these books to all be one-of-a-kind stand alone works. There is also an intent in sharing these personalized volumes with others, either directly (person to person) or in a cyber forum. A novel approach, as a Beatle (and Lennon) fan, an artist and a writer myself this work has huge appeal. Get a copy of this and join in on the journey !"
4,does the job,great avery product... quality paper goods. got the job done.no paper cuts while trying to peel off labels!kinda pricey... prob much cheaper at Wal-Mart
4,Nice Irish Folk Music,"If you enjoy Irish music, this is a great album. O'Brien vocals combined with plenty of fiddle make for an enjoyable listening experience. Each song tells a story and that's what I like about folk music."
2,Not worth it,"This offers no protection for the phone at all. While giving a little extra grip to the side of the 8830, it does so by sacrificing ease of removing it from pockets as the material catches the inside of your pockets as you remove it. The case also slips off the phone very easily and rips at the corners. All this disappointment in less than 48 hours."
5,Much harder in reality than the samples made it appear,"The sample puzzles that the ""look inside"" feature shows are easier than the puzzles it doesn't show. I was impressed with this and recommend it for anyone who truly is searching for challenging puzzles. These are NOT for beginners or those who quickly become frustrated. The obvious solution is usually wrong, at least in this book."
4,Nice!,"This is a great book, though it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. There are some errors in the book (usually typographical) but other than that this is a great way to occupy your time and boost your logic skills."
3,Not so challenging,These are really more like riddles than puzzles. I'm disappointed. Seems more suited for a young teen than an adult.
3,Okay - pretty slow and moody. May be a bit depressing.,"I originally was ready to submit a review that wasn't very complimentary of this offering. I felt it was too moody, introspective, and country-ish. Each time I've listened to it, there seems to be something else that catches my ear and I find myself saying, ""That was pretty good,"". It's still moody, introspective,and country-ish. But there are other elements in here that give appeal beyond the obvious. A subtle work that deserves a listen. I'd suggest that you listen to it before you buy. This isn't for everybody, and the released singles are not indicative of the remainder of the tracks (I heard a DJ compare ""Lullaby"" to Lou Reed's style - This guy most definitely doesn't sound like Lou Reed). If you have an aversion to mellow country-ish music - stay away, otherwise, this isn't too bad for a quiet listen."
5,Inspiration with a capital WHOOOOO,"Firstly, i was so impressed with this cd that i wrote to his mailing fan club ... im a song writer myself and not many albums take my ear like this one did ..... Shawn Mullins has more soul in his little finger than most have in their music careers ! His music represented a release for me... he hits on tenderness and also sparks a fire in me too... his cd is quite varied so it caters for the quiet times when you wanna sit back and just chill, and then it handles the rockin nights that we share with friends .. :) If any song , whatever it may BE or have been written FOR... CAN make someone smile or just plain make you wanna close your eyes and feel GOOD.... then its 5 stars to me :) A review that sums this cd up as plain or not memeorable coudl only be from a sole or musical heart that never set itself free enough to see INTO what this atrist tried to create and sell over to us when he completed it :) sorry but hey, us musoes say it LIKE IT IS ! smiles x"
1,This guy is nuts!!,"What is with this guy!!?? this is horrible!! it is hard to stay awake through his endless droning while he strums his guitar. and he doesnt even sing, it is more like he carries out a boring conversation about his lost love in an all-time low tone that would make for an exelent sleep-aid. Now the worst part is that this costs money! I personally would have paper that this cd containing horrendous sounds. This is torture!!"
2,"One or two decent songs, the rest is filler","The famous ""Lullabye"" song that received a good deal of radio play is good, but none of the other songs on the CD have the same tempo or character. They're sleepy and dull.For me, it sounded like a person trying too hard to be a poet and not making it. I usually don't write reviews, but I thought it necessary to balance out all the rave positive reviews I've read about this albumn (which is partly why I bought it).[I originally wrote this in 1999, but it didn't get posted right away because I forgot to display my e-mail address.]"
1,this cd is bad,"This is one of the worst cds I have ever had the misfortune of buying. I wonder how this guy ever got a recording contract. You can purchase a used copy of this cd on amazon for 1 cent, that should tell you something about its quaility."
1,As Bad As It Gets,"My god, do people really listen to this? that song Rockabye or Lullaby is the worst song I have ever had the misfortune to hear. Thus far I've been able to avoid hearing the track in its entirety, but not so lucky tonight. I mean, is the guy rapping? talking? why is he talking for the whole track? why does he sound like he's wasted? The dude sounds like he's doing a parody of himself. seriously! The track is so awful that it made me dizzy! Till now, Bye Bye American Pie was the absolute bottom of the heap, no questions asked, unequivical, without doubt most awful piece of music that i have ever experienced. Lullabye is ten times worse."
2,Shimmer is great but not much else to offer,"I got this CD because I loved Shimmer and I thought that maybe there would be other great songs just like it on the CD. I never thought it could be this bad! Nearly every other song ,except Lullaby, sounds exactly the same. I don't understand why all these other reviews are saying he's so great. He may put feeling into his lyrics, but the songs are so slow and boring that you don't listen to the lyrics because you're only asking yourself, ""Why did I buy this?"" If you think Shimmer is great just go buy the single and don't waste your time and money on the rest of the CD."
1,Overwhelming lack of creativity,"I can't believe this is the state that music has become today. This MTV saturated pop music is enough to make a person who truly likes music, and sees it as an art (not some lack of talent junk like this), throw up. This album is full of awful song structures, EMBARASSINGLY STUPID poetry, and simply bad music. Those of you who think this is music, or anything else on MTV or Top-40 radio, needs to think again, and notice that this is absolute disgusting."
2,Sing!,"Shawn's music is okay, but it seems that he is too afraid to really sing. In the few instances where he does sing (instead of murmuring), his voice sounds fine. The chorus of Lullaby is good, but the rest sounds like talking to me. Actually, most of the tracks sound like talking. Shawn needs to gather up the courage and really start singing. I'm glad I borrowed this album, and not purchased it."
2,It's lacking guts,"This CD isn't what I'd call horrible, but Shawn really needs to learn how to get some guts and sing. He talks in way too many of the tracks, and let's be honest here, who CAN'T pick up a guitar and just talk while they strum? What a silly album."
4,Great CD for lounging around to,"I was very impressed with this disk. It's also pretty easy (and cheap) to find used. They lyrics are quite unique, and the melodies are relaxed. I listen to it while I work (on the computer) and it's great. I would recommend it strongly. I'm going to try and listen to some of his other albums before I buy them, since I have this fear that they all sound the same. This one is a keeper, though."
5,"Great voice, even better live.","I didn't discover this CD until this year, and I can't seem to get these songs out of my head. I bought the CD because I was hooked on Lullaby, but I love the rest of it, too. He just tells good stories and has a great voice. That puts him miles ahead of a lot of other performers. His voice is even better in a live show, something I was lucky enough to witness at a free concert in Boston this summer."
5,"Lullaby, that's how this song feels, like a lullaby","I love the song Lullaby. Before I had the CD I waited a long time for it to come on the radio not just because it is my boyfriend and I's song but also because it is just such a great song and it actually makes sense unlike other songs people sing these days :o) Shawn's music comes from real life and personally, that is the best music out there is when they really know what they are singing about. Anyways, if you haven't gotten this CD yet, please buy it sometime. You'll love the rest of the songs because nobody has such a catchy voice as he does! Keep it up Shawn!"
4,"Soothing, lyrical, beautiful.","This CD is known for its song ""Lullabye"", which was a hit a year or so ago. However, it contains many other great songs as well. It is a nice CD to listen to when you are in a mellow mood or want to relax. Shawn's voice is soothing, the lyrics to his songs are poetic and beautiful, and his guitar-playing is relaxing and fantastic. Although Shawn Mullins was a one-hit wonder as far as the radio goes, don't think that ""Lullabye"" is his only good song. Although he is no longer getting much airtime, his CD is very good and I highly recommend it."
5,Absolute must for ALL English/ Language Arts Teachers,But don't stop there. ALL teachers need to read this book. Provides the perfect explanation and strategies for teaching comprehension to upper level students. Fits perfectly with the new Utah State Core for English! I've read it twice and plan to read it again so that I can build each year in the way I use the strategies.
2,Lots of Cutesy Fluff Interspersed with some Useful Info,"This could have been a more effective piece of work if the editors at Heinemann,the publisher, would have done a better job of curtailing the extensive droning on by the co-authors regarding their conversations and their moment-by-moment descriptions (I awake, I sip my coffee, I gaze at the overcast sky, my thoughts go back to yesterday, etc.). The practical and useful information, some of it helpful and some marginal, is buried within pages of this type of meandering. The author's seem determined that all practical information be presented within flowery, cutesy stories. I took notes as I read the book and discovered no new earth shattering information. Good reading teachers who read this book will find that they are already doing much of what is being prescribed by the authors."
2,Are you kidding me?,"I read this during my master's program. It is alot of wasted text. I wish it had listed the strategies, attached appendices and not had so much additional mumbo jumbo. This is awesome for discussions on comprehension, but useless as a day to day guide. I will keep my Atwell and Fountas books on hand instead."
3,"Interesting and useful, once you get past the lengthy digressions","Although I enjoyed this book and found the strategies exciting and compelling, it was horribly frustrating to read. Here's a comprehension strategy to use when reading this book: Skip the first 5-6 pages of each chapter. The author starts each chapter with text that connects, in some abstract way, to the theme of the chapter. While the points are usually valid, they could easily be summed up in a page or so - not 6. While I think I understand her overall point that we as teachers should be aware of the strategies we use as we read, her constant modeling of this gets to be really, really, irritating."
4,A Great product for little money,The Monster Cable J2 CD1-3 High-Performance Audio Interconnect is one of the best out there for as little money as it is. I suggest if you need an audio cord you should get this one!
5,The best darn movie EVER!!,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life, I am searching for it. If anyone is doubting buying this movie, don't!If anyone is saying ""He's 11, he doesn't know a good movie from a bad one."" I do! I have a record at Blockbuster of over 900 rentals, and well, I think I'm a good critic."
3,Ok shoe,"First off, the shoe I received is not the shoe pictured. I need plenty of support for my poor ole dogs and this shoe doesn't have it. It is truly a light walking shoe. I have since ordered the correct Easy Spirit and love them."
2,not loving these shoes,"I don't know if it is the shoe or my foot, but I am finding them too large at the heels so they slip there causing irritation when I am walking/jogging on the treadmill. I would not buy this style again."
4,Great Shoes,"Very comfortable. The ""W"" really does mean Wide. If you have wide feet, you know that first thought when trying on new shoes, ""Oh, they,ll feel better when they've stretched a little."" Not with these. They fit right away. They fit when I put them on and they still fit after they are broken in. Good quality. I like the shoes a lot, I just don't give 5 stars unless I find something amazing. I would certainly purchase another pair."
4,Easy Spirit makes a great shoe...,I really like the Easy Spirit shoe products... this shoe Jumper is wonderful... the only one that I like better and is just about like it (but made better is the Easy Spirit Threshold - available only at JC Penney that I can figure out). The design and support are terrific!
2,"HORRIBLE! Stiff, Clunky Hot and Heavy","These shoes are terrible and i totally hate them. I had originally ordered a pair of Easy Spirit Gofast which i loved but had to return because of sizing. As the Jumper was the only shoe available in a half size at the time i went with them even though i wasn't thrilled with the style.The style though bad, is not why i dislike these so much. These are marketed as a walking shoe. I tested the walkability at the flower show and halfway through the show my feet were hurting. I don't know why they call these walking shoes. I felt like Frankenstein's monster in these shoes.They are so big and clunky and heavy and stiff. No ventilation, no flexibility they aren't good for walking let alone working out. And your feet will be so hot.I've had these for a while a now but shortly into wearing them the man made material started peeling off. I feel like an old woman in these shoes!"
5,Works as advertised!,I specifically purchased this to blend in with my yellow bike and also provide me with extra reflection at night. This works like a charm! Thanks!
2,Stale ink,I had to request a refund. The ribbon was so stale that the printing skipped too much to be usable.
3,cuetions,"Samsung LNT1954H 19"" LCD HDTV White. Good day I made this purchase three days ago and they already made the position to my card of credito but receipt a part message you I do not even need I number of tracking"
5,Looks Great and works well,Installed in an office with both PC and TV hook-ups. Works great and looks good. I like the control buttons on the side. This was very easy to setup and the price was great. Would also recommend for kitchen. It's getting hard to find white LCD TV's.
4,FITS IN PLACE,OUTSTANDING DELIVERY AND FITS OUR KITCHEN AND SPACE. ONLY DRAW BACK IS THE DARK PICTURE (BLACK WHEN IN ALT OF LIGHT)
3,Nice but very small,"Size does matter. The TV is nice enough, but unless you're right on top of it, like a desktop computer, it's too small even for a small room. I put it into a small bedroom and felt like I needed binoculars sitting in a chair about 8 feet away. I returned it and upgraded to the 23"" Samsung. It's only four more inches, but it made all the difference. The bigger model also comes with full stereo outputs on the back, unlike the 19"". If you can afford it, the bigger one is worth it."
4,Smells great,"This is a good substitute for the perfume. In these economic times, saving everything you can, counts. It smells good also. No reason to buy $100 bottle of perfume."
2,not what advertised,Was very dissapointed because I thought it was just plain dried mango. I came with added sugar and preservatives. That was not stated in the product description..
2,Not impresed by this CD,"The CD was not what I had in mind, it was not very melodic or upbeat. Later music by this artist is much more vibrant."
5,Super Chingon el Disco!!!!,"Que buen disco companiebros, deveras que se la han rajado estos compas de Chapalita!, yo me acuerdo cuando tocaban en las fiestas y en las kermeses de Ciudad del sol con el cacual, el inda, neto franco y muchos mas de la epoca, super buen trabajo y la grabacion esta excelente, compren el disco no se van a arrepentir ni tantito!"
1,Not Worth the Time,"More left wing revisionism! Why are there no books that stand up for the positive aspect of our nations history? All of this politically correct stuff is enough to make one shake their head in disbelief! If the author lived in the West and or was a student of history I might be able to have enjoyed this work. If you are a far left person who believes that all America has done is kill and maim, you will enjoy this...If you are still in full use of your intellect, pass it by."
4,Awesome,"Very good studio moe. Plane crash, Happy Hour Hero, Nebraska are some of my favorites, if you like moe. get this."
3,"Not their best, but better than most of what's out there!","I was a little disappointed with this CD. Hard to really grill it because they're truly a LIVE band and to be experienced LIVE to ""understand"" them (I've seen 'em only five times, but was FLOORED by every show). It's not bad...but I think No Doy and Headseed are better representations of what they're really ""like"". This CD is ""easier on the ears"" than the others mentioned, but it's the goofy lyrics and stop-start-on-a-dime jams that draw me to moe. and I really didn't feel this CD had much of that. On the other hand, I would listen to TC&CT over 99% of whats being played on the radio.....without a doubt. Try their new CD ""L"" if you want a flat out ""moe.down"""
5,Moe. at its best,"Tin Cans and Car Tires is a great example of the talent that these four musicians have. Its great that the four have finally put ""IT"" on an album. Plane Crash, one of the bands favorite live songs, is outstanding on this cd especially with the Violins at the begining. This is a must get album for all moe. lovers."
4,great rock,this album is very good and fun to listen to. moe. is not very well known but its worth getting to know them. this is their best in my opinion but all of the albums are worth buying. they are also an excellent live group....
4,4 because i covers almost all.,"ok starting with a little bit of info on me. I am a private pilot with most of my ratings and i went to embry-riddle so i do know alot about flying and air traffic already. But for the book, this book was both good and bad for a couple reasons. Bad because there are several spelling errors that normally wouldnt be of any concern but some of the errors actually gave you the wrong information about the exercise that you were in. Good because it did give you alot of practice problems and covers most all the information that is on the test. also the CD that it comes with was BIG help because it was almost identical to what was on the test. All and all the book was good not great but good, i did pass the test and the book helped me get a hired score for sure."
4,Wouldn't test without it!,"After not knowing what to really expect, I would say that the book was a great prep for the test. For the Air Traffic Scenarios, I would suggest using the web links given in the book. The CD did not work well for me, as others have previously mentioned. The Analogies section is a whole world unto itself, so good luck! But I did feel really prepared with the Letter Factory program after working from the CD. The same can be said for the Scan section. The Dials were also rather straight forward. The Angles were actually easier than the CD because you received your allotted time for each question. However, in the math section, there are definitely some answers that are not correct in the book - the CD portion was useless! - and it would be nice if they laid out how to achieve the math solutions to help you improve as you are studying. Overall, I am SO glad I got this book, but definitely wish I had more help from the CD in the math and ATC areas (and that it operated on Macs)!"
3,Good not Excellent,For 50$ I expected to get more detail. Basic information was good enough to get someone interested in attending school of ATC. Good enough to get school names for that. Not good on statistics about how many of the students will actually be able to work at air traffic control.
3,It's okay,Yeah I thought it would be an excellent book to help me into ATC but it is great for Americans but for Australians it is just okay and will probably help you a little!!
3,Not exciting,"For the size of the book, would have expected to have more stories about being one, and what sort if difficulties they face, so then the readers can understand how difficult it is to be one. Some good problem solving questions relating to ATC and a good reference glossary at the back of the book.Also comes with a CD for tests and samples. CD not yet reviewed.Would like to see another book with more in depth details.Overall good starter book."
2,Not very accurate or up to date,I bought this book a few years ago (I have since been hired and am an air traffic controller). The book gives you a vague idea at best of what you will see when you take the test. I would recommend checking sites like stuckmic as opposed to getting this book as they will have more and better information and you can post questions and participate in conversations in the forums if you like. It is also useful to follow the forums to find out when others who applied to your job posting are getting offer letters and such. Getting hired is quite a long ordeal so it's nice to know that you aren't the only one waiting months for the next phase of the hiring process.
3,"Best AT-SAT prep out there, but that's considering there isn't anything else","This book has good sample questions similar to what you'll find on the test, the software that comes with it is very buggy and actually harder than the test. Put in a few hours practicing the plane simulation, the letter factory and review your basic math skills. Spend extra time on the simulation.Very decent prep for the money, software is buggy and material seems poorly edited and hastily written but for the money it's a good deal. You'll feel alot more prepared for what's to come, and I think that's worth 40$."
1,Transpersonal Coaching Changed My Life!,"I've been working with a transpersonal coach and she has done more for me in six months than any other counselor or psychologist that has used traditional methods. Using transpersonal psychology, I've been able to get over severe childhood trauma that had been holding me down my entire life. And that is in addition to many other empowering experiences I've had. In fact, I am seriously considering becoming a transpersonal coach myself.I think this guy has his information wrong! Sure, if you want to spend 10 years or more sitting on some shrink's couch talking and talking but not getting very far, go ahead and use the other methods. But they never worked for me. The exception to this is cognitive therapy, but even then I got more out of buying Dr. David Burns ""Feeling Good"" and doing the work myself."
1,No an original copy,"This is not an original copy of the CD. The box came broken. The song list was written backwords. The sound was good, but when purchasing a product, especially a CD you expect it to be the original copy from the artist. Otherwise I could have downloaded mp3 versions for less. Very dissappointed. The music is great though!"
3,DeColores,"It's the same male voice for all the songs. And although the songs are lovely, hearing the same voice can be tedious. Also, the cover lists the songs, but they don't play in that order."
5,Fantastic...BUT no liner notes/lyrics!,"I love this CD--the vocals are clear, in-tune, and the spirit that comes through is so joyous. My 3-year-old loves listening to it as I do. (This is a major accomplishment when you're talking about music targeted for kids, as all parents know; most ""kid music"" is so inane and badly produced it's like listening to nails on chalkboard.)BUT. What I wish I'd known before I'd bought this CD is that it comes with no liner notes. None. No lyrics whatsoever! A huge lack given that I (like most folks?) bought the CD to help boost our Spanish comprehension.I eventually found the companion book and ordered it, but it would have been great to have known *beforehand* that the CD is actually half of a set."
4,Good mouse,"As has been noted, there is no serial adapter. But, it's a good quality mouse for a good price. Works as well as any I've had. Did not load the drivers so can't comment, but it works fine without them. As long as you don't need the adapter, it's a great deal."
2,Taste like stale bananas,"These don't taste very good. I haven't found a person yet that likes them. They just taste bad, like old fruit. And the packaging is not frustration free! Often the glue runs and the bag is stuck within the box."
5,"Not super sour, but definitely super tasty","Organic candy can be hit-or-miss, but these are a hit. They're not as sour as some of the non-organic sour candy, but they've got a nice tartness to them. And the texture is really good - a bit softer than your traditional Gummi Bear, but with a very crisp and fruity flavor. My husband and I are grownups and we love them."
5,Chuck Full of the Best Stories!,My kids and I love this book! It is full of really great stories:Chicka Chicka Boom BoomSylvester & the Magic PebbleThe Tub PeopleThe SneetchesWhere the Wild Things AreOwenFreight TrainCurious GeorgeMadelineThe Berenstain BearsHarry the Dirty DogMiss Nelson is Missingand many more!
5,Great dance shoe!,"Very comfortable shoes! I bought these as my first dance shoes and adjusted to them very well. I wear a size 8.5-9 in normal shoes and purchased these in a size 8.5, probably should have gotten the 9 though, but they did stretch and I still wear them with no problem!"
5,Boston Red Sox socks,"Excellent service. Prompt mailing, good packaging, very pleased with product. Especially happy with transaction as I had a problem with an order from e-bay that wasn't resolved. Don't plan to order from them again."
2,boring,"I don't know why this C.D sucks but it does.This series has by my reckoning 1 excellent session and by that I mean you should own .Marques Wyatts' disc is an absolute masterpiece of soulful funk groove for partys or just vacumming the floor to.Cotto on the other hand has no idea how to vary the sound and one waits in vain as on his dreadful 'Samba in the house' for something MUSICAL to happen. The endless drums just grind on aimlessly and we are left to wonder whether he has an ear for music at all.Davidson Ospina has written some incredible music, none of it is on this disc.Toca me la musica should be in everyones latin house collection and can be found on the Nascente release Revolution in the House"
5,Phantom of the Opera,"Another fine piece to my collection. Well worth the price, compare to Las Vegas !!!"
1,What wasn't told you...,The camera in this kit expired at year ago and the scanning coupon expired in 2000! I was so disappointed!
5,"Beatles,Neil Finn and Elliot Smith fans take note!","From its inception, ""A Way to Your Heart"" invites listeners to revel in their deepest emotional well, nonetheless compelling them to tap along to its pop hooks and hand claps. The title track is the beautiful hit song you've never heard before. ""Try to Get Along"" with its Harrison approved guitar riffs and pleading chorus, begs the question: how can music this gripping and introspective traverse such melodic space? Lyrically, you can count on Nourallah for witty repartee and sardonic glee: ""Two rights just make one wrong."" And then at times, Salim asks us to follow imagistic, surreal lines such as ""I see you shining like a gun, your love a ray for everyone"" inside the wash of carousel sounds in the beautiful ""Avenue."" Wonder where the Beatles' influence has gone? Look no further than Nourallah, and be grateful someone so talented, passionate and intelligent has picked up their torch."
4,Cool Replacement Headphone,"General:These coloured headphones are made to look very much a like the iconic white headphones from Apple. But why settle for white when there are so many colors in a rainbow. Proporta has found the solution and has created these coloured headphones series. They come in simple plastic packaging, the material of the headphone is very different from apple headphones and it is lacking inline mic/volume. But since this is retailing for half the price of what apple sells their headphones that can be over looked. The paint on the headphones are glossy and look very nice. From a distant they look exactly like the apple headphones.Sound Quality:I am not a audiophille so i will be comparing these to the apple headphones. They sound very a like almost similar. But then again the Apple headphones never sounded that great to begin with. None the less it offers great sound for the casual listeners.Value:At $13 these aren't bad, but they could be better4/5 stars"
1,Band sooo easily soiled and cannot be cleaned!!!,"I was excited when I purchased this watch. It's in my favorite color and seemed to offer everything I was looking for. I wore it to work a few days and before I knew it, the band started to turn colors, as if I was wearing it while rolling around in the mud or something. I am a very clean person and the notion of walking around with a dirty-looking watch is icky. I tried to clean the band as soon as I noticed the greyish-greenish colors and low and behold, no product can remove any of it!!! What kind of a watch is made where its band soils soooo readily and for no apparent reason and then cannot be washed!!? I've NEVER owned anything quite like it!!! I am sending this watch back!! It should never have been sold!!!!"
2,Touchy Buttons + Random Cycling of Settings,"All is great about the watch EXCEPT:1. The touchy buttons - you can ""blow"" on the buttons to change to chrono, alarm, etc... so naturally it gets frustrating to always have to move the setting back to time.2. At times the watch decides to cycle repeatedly through all the settings (chrono, time, alarm, etc..) and you only have to push the button on the side once.Overall, I wouldn't buy this watch again. 2 stars for style and shape."
3,Need more pics,"I love how this book is so different from the plethora of dessert books out there. We have been bombarded by several versions of chocolate cakes, apple pies, and brownies galore, but alas, this book is so wonderfully refreshing (quite literally as well!) as it focuses on fruit. But while the desserts and even the names are so uniquely wonderful, I feel that this book would have been better served had there been more pictures of the recipes. Especially since the names of the dessert are not your average desserts -- it would help inspire those wanting to try different recipes to see what the finished product is supposed to look like.I also like the introductory mini lesson on how to care for and handle fruit -- very informative!"
3,A interesting view of censorship consequences...,"I got this short story/play becuz i am interested in all of Kate Winslet's future movies, as the books tend to be wonderful. This story was quite different then what i expected it to be! It is a very graphic detailing of what can happen when you try to censor a artist, and what means this artist can take to get his point across. I would recommend this book..but only to those who are not easily offended by blashemy of God and other religious sects...and who also are not offended by pornographic references! It will be quite entertaining to see how this movie is made!"
4,"I Love 2-in-1 Books, But...","...this one has some problems. Not big ones (the standalone ""Imzadi"" had no paragraphs - this isn't like that), but still, it's irritating. At Location 5402-5404, there are two titles. The first (The Beginning of the End) is correct. The second (Triangle: Imzadi II) belongs several pages forward. Amazon, I love my Kindle, but these errors are seriously cramping my style - please let us fix them!"
4,"First part was incredible, second part not so much","I love Peter David's books, but I really wasn't a fan of the second book in this series. I didn't care tremendously for the plot, didn't care for the testing of Worf by Lwaxana and the rest of Betazed society. The first book however still ranks as one of my favorites (I actually had the first one when it came out on softback well over a decade ago, and fortunately survived being in my household with numerous foster kids coming in and out. That being said, it's still worth buying this collection, because you can compare and contrast the two books, and at the time of my writing, it's the same price as the single first Imzadi. So, to sum up, the first one makes it worth reading, the second one I liked, but it pales compared to the first one."
1,Rip Off - Republished two old stories in one new Title,"If you have ""Imzadi"" and ""Imzadi II"" .. there's no need to waste your money. I hate getting ripped off by authors and publishers!"
5,Everything I look for in a wireless adapter,"Doesnt overheatCommunication range - 65ft @ 54Mbps / 1870ft @ 1Mbpssupports multiple encryption standards from WEP64 to WPA-AESCompatible with other Buffalo AOSS productspigtail connection for external antenna in fringe areasWardriver friendly, works with netstumbler and PGPComes with AirStation Client Manager and JIwire HotSpot Locator software (system resource friendly programs)I use the card solely with my IBM Thinkpad T20 running Win2k on 512MB of RAM. It has been running nonstop with absolutely no dropped connections for 25 hours now. Im very happy with this card and highly recommend it to others."
4,Solid 54g performance; Airport software crashes though,"Hi: i bought the Buffalo card because it uses the same Broadcomm Airforce chipset as the Apple Extreme airport card.This makes it so using it with a Powerbook just works with the software.I've used it with a dozen base-stations, all types of connections and find ita great performer. (...)My only complaint: if you pop the pc-card out without turning off the airport software or putting the powerbook to sleep, it crashes into some weird command line thing that asks for a debugger.Oh well, then don't do that!Jim"
1,don't buy this,"Was looking for card w/ext antenna but this software was very incompatible with Windows XP and caused huge problems. Their tech support was clueless, and took their advice to uninstall. Bought an Orinoco Gold card works perfectly."
3,This product includes external antenna Interface only!,"Contrary to the description on this web page (as of 5/23/2003 1400EDT) this product includes only the Buffalo AirStation WLI-CB-G54A variant of the wireless LAN CardBus card with an external antenna interface. No Indoor Omni Antenna is included in the package, only the CardBus card itself. The description on the confirming email I received from TechDepot has the exact same wording, but a call to TechDepot customer support confirmed that the description is, apparently, incorrect. The wording on the Packing List uses the description AirStation 54Mbps WLS CBUS Card w/Ext Ant I/F (I/F=Interface I assume).So, I rate the product only a three. I have used the WLI-CB-G54 (not the 'A' model) and have been very satisfied with it. I downgrade it here only because of the product description is incorrect. I expected to get the card and the indoor omni antenna."
2,"Cards are pretty, book is risible","The cards are very pretty, quite well-made, and nicely colored. It's clear that a lot of care went into the getting the flashing colors right, a task that isn't easy to do, especially when mass producing.The book's riddled with factual errors and absurd exercises involving optical illusions.If you want a set of Tattwa cards, buy the set and toss the book."
5,thank you,"I found this to be ultra-relevant to the 21st century. As an outsider in the modern world, this man's experiences spoke to me in a way that no person, regardless of whether I have met them or not, ever has before. I thank you, Mr. Amos, for helping me find my place. This is for all those For those of you who are lost or traped."
1,"do not like, not easy to use, poor customer service",the shipping cost more than the pen itself. no return is allowed.restock fees will be charged. The pen was not easy to use for my son.do not recommend this product.
1,Not Convinced,"Evo pen -- Why don't they even show us how to hold the darn thing? I need to buy something easy to use, but I will not buy it if I am not convinced it is a workable idea. The only thing I know to do is find an object of similar appearance and try to make writing motions with it."
4,Better than most,This guide is better than most. Lots of useful information about cultural differences. It does not contain much tourist information though so it is best used together with a more detailed guide.
5,Awesomeness,"Awesome. Words can't explain. Buy it, trust me you wont regret it if you are a hardcore tech fan."
3,not a good first book on probability,"The problem with this book is that there is no way you can understand the later chapters based on the earlier chapters. This is a more like the survey of the important topics in probability and stochastic processes. There are appendices on information theory, game theory, and branching processes. The book includes basic concepts of probability, random variables, and Markov chains. Feller has a better introductory book on probability."
3,Kind of fun,"I like this toy a little bit. It is ment for the 3.5"" scale. I like to make my 3.5"" BB in it and fire missles at my 3.5"" Mad Mod figure.(In case anyone was wondering,BB comes packed in many sets and you can get Mad Mod packed with Thunder)"
4,durable little teen titan toy,We own most of these teen titan toys. They are made of high quality plastic and most of the can interlock to form bigger toys. They are a must for the teen titan fan. They will last for a long time!!
1,Bad Spider,Piece of junk. you have one button to go forward and another turns the thing in one direction ONLY. NO reverse or turn in other direction. Also thing is SLOW. Don't waste your money.
3,Amusing for a while,"I got this as a gift for Christmas, because I love spiders and Halloween. I had high hopes for this toy. I am disappointed that it does not work on any carpeted surfaces, and I have found that the spider reaction time is pretty slow. I find it to be poor engineering that the spider uses one size battery and the remote uses a different size battery. Still, it will amuse me for a while, and it occupies my cat here and there."
4,Good for pranks,"Looks real and it's really big because two AA batteries goes under the spider. I just bought it to make a prank on my girlfriend and she believed it. I didnt have too much fun after it, she told me to throw it out. She's really scared of spiders."
4,"Cool Toy, Somewhat Realistic",My nephew who is 9 loves the spider. He doesn't use the control that much being that you can hear the spider approaching because it is a little noisy. He uses the spider to scare family members. It's a little fury and it moves somewhat like a real spider. I'm sure a little spider fan will like it.
4,Awesome fun!,"My nephew really got a ""jump"" out of this toy. He loved how real it looked and had fun scaring all his family!"
1,not what it says,i just bought this for christmas from amazon and am so disappointed it is not the furry one that is shown in the picture. It is not in a box.. it has no fur on it. it is a cheap version of the one that is shown in the picture.... I bought them for a christmas presents... I had bought one last year and this is not like the Uncle Milton I bought before.... It is not what it shows...
2,So so spider,My son played with this rc spider for about 20 minutes the first day and 5 the next day. Then he forgot about it. I regret having bought it- he was so crazy for it when he did not have it!
1,Do not buy this.,"I bought this toy for my sons 6 birthday. He was so excited. It didnt work after 2 adults tried for an hour. So i exchanged it, again it didn't work. Three times the charm not so much. after the 3rd time we gave up and got our money back. Not worth the head ache my son is still disappointed."
1,Piece of junk,"Horrible. Worked poorly for about 20 seconds, then pooped out. Don't waste your money. This thing is a complete ripoff!"
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this for my nephew and within 5 minutes of arriving it ceased to operate. He never even saw the toy. His parents were putting batteries in the remote and testing it when the remote just stopped working (brand new batteries).Don't waste your money on this item.
4,RC Spider,Interesting spider. It makes a lot of noice when moving. Looks a lot like a real tarantula except larger.
3,spider,this toy is slow and not very durable however watching my kids would laugh so hard when it scared me thet are 3 and 4 so that alone is enough for me
2,Not so realistic,"On the pictures, it looks so real, and because it was from an educational toy company, I expected it to look or move somewhat like a real tarantula. It's about 4 times the size of the biggest tarantula I've seen. And it doesn't crawl, it sorta rolls across the floor on wheels while the legs jerk. That is, if you have a floor smooth enough for the wheels to turn on...The nasty plastic hair smells toxic too...I was disappointed."
2,motor noise too much,I bought this spider to scare some people in my office. visually it's great but as soon as you hit the button on the remote the motor makes too much noise. It's pretty unrealistic as soon as it moves. I did manage to creep out a few of them......as long as it just sits there.
1,dissapointed,Christmas present for our 6 year old. It was #1 on his list. Got it and it doesn't work. We have to send it back.
1,Worst toy ever,"I never imagined I'd leave a review that said, ""If I could give this zero stars, I would."" But, my God! This has to be the greatest dissappointment I've ever removed from a package. I should say seven packages. Believe it or not, my Grandparents bought these for all the Grandkids. Of the eight that we purchased, only one worked. Kind of. Actually, it worked poorly. Against my advice, they exchanged rather than returned them all. Lo and behold, of the next batch of garbage none of them worked. These are the biggest peices of junk I've ever seen marketed as toys. Even worse than Happy Meal Toys. Only buy them if you like to make your children cry or if you like to return things and leave mean reviews!"
1,Disappointing,This should have been a great Christmas surprise but was nothing but a dud. It has great potential but I suspect poor manufacturing was the cause of no battery connection.
1,Just will not go!,"I bought this for a grandchild for Christmas. She was super excited to get it! However, it just will not walk! We have slick hardwood floors and this thing just sits and grinds, moving its legs but refuses to walk. It is even worse on carpetting.The toy looks awesome. It could have alot of potential to be a big hit if the manufacturer would redesign its little wheels on the bottom of the spider to get better traction.Its a little loud too. The griding motor sound ruins any ""sneak attacks"" or tricks you want to play on people... but the dog doesnt seem to mind! It drove our dogs nuts.... they wanted to attack it and DID!"
2,Disappointing,I bought this for a prankster friend. We discovered that it does not work on carpet (we're talking no pile carpet). Very disappointing!
3,OK,"I got one of these elsewhere for my son and I have to say that I am not that impressed. It doesn't work particularly well and I have noticed little hairsmy falling out all over my floor. Although my son did spend some time playing with it, the novelty wore off pretty quickly because he couldn't control it. OK at best."
3,Its ok,"The product is as advertised. I mean, I did not expected anything else. Its a good prank on kids, but grownups wont fall for it, I think the biggest complaint are the eyes, they have red lights and that from scratch damages the overall conception, spiders don't have bright red lights for eyes.But its ok, I liked it and had fun with it. Dogs hate that thing."
2,Not built well.,"Would not recommend buying this toy. My parent's researched and found this toy online, there was all this excitement in receiving it since my son was about three years old then. I think the toy broke withih 24hours of opening it. It worked great at first, but then the hand controls started getting fuzzy and the legs wouldn't move. Thank goodness for Amazon reviews right? What a bummer..."
4,"Great, As Long As You Read The Reviews First",I read the reviews and knew what to expect when giving this as a gift to my BF for Christmas. He had to make an adjustment to the wheels because the rubber rings on them were too thin and wouldn't allow the spider to work on his wood floors but after that it was great.
3,RC spider,"exactly what you'd expect to get for the price in terms of quality & function. it is a low cost RC toy, just like advertised"
5,A replacement for a lost book.,"I don't read these sports books - just bought it to replace one that went astray - previously loaned (so the owner said) to my husband. I hope he's happy with it - I guess he was, since he wanted it back."
5,A must-have for people with dot matrix printers!,"I love these labels. So far, I have printed out 500 of them, and I wasn't disappointed at ALL. The backing of each label is sticky enough, meaning it will definitely stay where you put it, but it's not so sticky that you will tear it to pieces trying to get it off of say, a piece of glass or a ziploc container. I did have to adjust the margins on my word processor because of the space between the labels, but after that it was all smooth sailing, and that will differ from person to person. That's more of a word processor problem. The ""wax paper"" backing is perforated for every label, but barely, so it is difficult but possible to rip off labels individually. Every 6 labels, there is a deeper perforation that is easy to tear, so I prefer to tear sheets of 6 at a time and throw away the backing when I've peeled off all 6 labels. Very convenient, I highly recommend it!"
2,Very disappointing,"There is entirely too much repetition here, primarily because the author attempts to track the lives and experiences of far too many people. Seward compounds this serious narrative issue with unwarranted speculation and outright errors. Instead of borrowing so heavily from Barbara Tuchman's structural techniques, Seward would have done well to emulate her research skills."
4,Took a while to install,"It took a while to install,the lock mechanism sticks sometimes.I really like it though,especially the color and metal.I like the knob to turn the lock."
3,Does the job but light duty,Good value for light duty but the Belkin 25ft Cat 6 Patch Snagless Blue (for a few dollars more) has stronger terminations and much more rugged.
2,Cornbread not so sweet,"Not impressed. Purchased due to Jerry Douglass appearance. Wouldn't even know he was on it. Bought with Fiddler's Green. Now that is a nice product, very nice. Jerry is on it as well, w/Stuart Duncan."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this book when I purchased it. Unfortunately, the information is extremely general and not very useful. I was hoping this book would be a good source of information for some papers I was writing, but I was extremely disappointed. There are much better books out there on the same topic."
2,Naval History,"I canceled my subscription to the magazine because it has become a forum for petty argumentation and bickering between readers and authors and also because it publishes too many articles which have absolutely nothing to do with its purported content, viz. naval history.IMHO, it is not worth the price the USNI is charging for it."
5,Naval History - Of the 5 others I read this is the best,Naval History is the single best history magazine I read. One small thing that makes this outstanding is that often those who made the history comment in the letters to the editor. This contains the work of the best history writers today and often spans the ages in its articles. What is really special is that several times a year they commit an entire issue to one historic event. They include fold out maps and articles from various authors. Naval History is highly recommended.
4,A Good Book for your Llibrary,"This is well illustrated and includes some beautiful pieces from which to draw inspiration. Well written with concise instructions, including templates you can copy and material lists if you wish to create the projects contained with in the book."
1,Extremely Light Duty Junk,"As a full time carpenter, I bought this drill a couple years ago. It worked great for light work, like drilling small holes in wood (not metal)and driving short screws (forget about lags). It was great for furniture projects where a delicate throttle and finesse was necessary. But if you plan on using this as your all-around, do-it-all drill, forget it. While driving some longer screws (3"") on a job (my first 18v Milwaukee finally wore out) the clutch inside snapped some gears. I called Makita and they sent me a replacement clutch (in the meantime I rush ordered a new 18v Milwaukee to finish the job). After that I only used it for extremely light duty work. A few jobs later, the replacement clutch started slipping before giving out completely. I shouldn't have to keep putting parts into a tool to keep it running. I love my other Makita tools (circ saw, and 10"" compound sliding miter) but this one is junk. Buy a real drill, stay away from this one."
4,Kettler Ergo Racer Review,"I bought the Kettler Ergo a couple of years ago to do indoor training when the weather gets bad. Quickly -Pros: *Very solid feeling. The eddy current wheel is very smooth, quiet, and provides plenty of resistance when you dial up the watts. Good adjustment possible on both seat and handle bars.Cons: *For the money, you'd expect software included. I paid over $1,500 and that rankled me that it is not included. *Outdated serial port interface on unit. Few new computers have these. I just recently purchased a Serial-USB converter cable. Finally I can see if I can get the 3rd party software to see if it will work.Overall: Very satisfied. I prefer a solid, quiet trainer that works to a noisy, cruddy one with good software."
1,Kettler Ergo Racer GT,Handlebars a disaster. Created by someone who never rode a bike. Can't stand and pedal like a spinning bike. It is quiet. Good for spinning while sitting only. Serious spinners will be disappointed. Keiser M3 a better option. Ride before buying the Kettler.
3,Stop trippin'.,"If your a sadistic freak, who collects nazi artifacts on ebay in his spare time, and reinacts famous battles in your backyard, my guess is you will be disappointed with this book, as it is not a ""compehensive refrence"" of every piece of camoflage ever worn...ever. To me this book is laid out nice, with photos of camo that are aesthetically pleasing, but not of any historical importance. Don't try to make this book something it's not. I don't even think there is any others like it.My overall summary:Good refrence for graphic designers. Bad refrence for armed forces enthusiasts."
4,Innovative book,"It is fun to move the squirrel across the pages and through the holes, but 2-3 year olds will require assistance to make sure the book does not rip. The pages are a heavy cardstock quality page, but not made for rough treatment. This is sweet story about a squirrel looking for his nuts; however, its up to you on whether or not you mention the woodsman who is trying to temp the squirrel with chocolate so that he may make some squirrel soup. All in all a good collection for a 2-5 year olds library."
1,a squirrels tail,"I am sure if I would have ordered a new book it would have been very good, but ordering a used one i was very upset when I found that half of the pages were ripped out of the book and the squirrl was missing. I won't do that again LIve and learn. I had the same thing happen with a used book called A mouse in the Hpuse. two disapointments all in the same day.ThanksRobert"
1,Bad for Kids,"The story is weak, the logistics of playing the game is poor, the graphics are OK. Not worth the time or money!"
3,Sherlock Holmes For Children; just not young children,"Was not sure what to expect from that as there were no reviews or detailed description. This set of stories is performed well but I was hoping it would be stories without some of the adult themes such as guns and murder. It is not that, it is a good retelling of the stories but includes elements not fit for very young children."
4,Great bag for the price,"Overall this bag is solid. The compartments don't work all that great, but are a cool option.I like the bag because it can fit on my stuff and then some, is sturdy, has some great partitions and is good value."
4,tom horn,Classic western grit movie..McQueen is always a pleasure to watch. Watched this movie years ago and its just as good now as it was then
5,Using 256MB modules,My HP d530 PC has four memory slots. Purchasing two additional 256MB modules at a great price upgraded the PC to 1G memory.
4,Excellent & detailed account of the Easter Offensive,"This is a excellent account of the 1972 Easter Offensive in Vietnam during the final stages of the American troop withdrawals. This is a story of courage, stupidity, cowardice and of major and minor fire-fights and battles. The courage of those American advisers and the South Vietamese troops they assisted during this brutal offensive is awe inspiring. Not to forget their enemies who took massive punishment from US airpower but carried on the fight! This is a well researched and written piece of military history which I think has been forgotten due to the fact that it was at the tail end of a unpopular war. The author has done a great job to remind us that the war didn't finish when all the troops got home, that people continued to fight & die long after. Well worth the time to read with over 500 pages of text, however the author could have provided some better maps."
3,"good first novel, but expected better from famed critic","This is a very funny book, with lots of Evelyn Waugh-type comedy, and English eccentrics and village life etc etc. And there's plenty to chew on intelectually. But being a big fan of Wood's passionate essays, I hoped for more from his first novel -- maybe something less conventional. Still, give the guy his due. He's a critic who can actually write (check out the first chapter, for instance)."
2,Lit Crit Strikes Out,"I enjoy reading Wood's literary criticism, and consider him among the best tilling that particular field today. He is smart, an excellent writer, and usually on the mark. But he is not a novelist. He writes ably enough here, yet there is no life in this novel. It is dead, inert. I won't beat him up because the book is scattershot, aimless, and his narrator is a total jerk. Jerks can be cool. But this BAG guy was insufferable, not to mention boring.When Saul Bellow died, a eulogist said that what he most enjoyed about reading Bellow was the quality of the mind behind his writing. In every novel, and not all of them were good, the reader knew he was in the presence of a captivating mind. As a critic, Wood approaches brilliance. As a novelist, however, his mind is as interesting as a piece of toast. He should stick to what he does best."
1,Save your money!!,"What is this ..., this psycopath has given us a novel of boring consequences. I'm sure pretentious Book Festival types will hail its ""genius"". Normal people will probably commit suicide. James Wood is a critic apparently, I think he should stick to that cause no real talent is needed to hurl stones at easy targets. I wonder if James has used heroine in the past, I dont care about his characters doin PHD courses, wow, this will really unite the free world this ""classic"" will. I much prefer less pretentious writers, not idiots masquarading asintellectuals, its just a book damn it. Dont buy this pap, buy Rick Reilly instead. I want to give this book 0 stars, but the geniuses that run this site imply that even hacks deserbe 1 star."
1,Ultimate XP Pro,"I wouldn't recommend anybody to buy this item. I tried this item on all my TV and is very poor quality picture. Is very difficult to read any text on the screen. You have to use the zoom option when ever you want to read the text. Even my Son don't like it, when I attached his computer to his TV. It takes awhile to adjust all the options to really get it right and believe me you won't get it the way you wanted. I'm a technician and I deal with video and sound and this item does not perform as advertise."
1,VGA to component video -Poor performance,The picture quality was poor. Poor brightness-contrast. Very poor sharpness. Complete waste of time trying to use this thing to make a HDTV into a computer monitor. Too bad my HDTV only has component video and no VGA input.
5,"Great Book about great characters in a great town, Great!","My Town is a book about life and how, if you just think about it, a solution to any problem is just waiting to be found. Our family loves it. Would be a wonderful family Holiday gift. Brings smiles and laughs to all of us. Plus Bill Wegman is just one nice guy and ""My Town"" is just one great book."
4,Such a cute book.,"""My Town"" is a great little book. The story is simple, but it has big meaning in it. The dogs are just wonderful and they'll bring a smile to your face. I recommend."
5,The real thing!,I've ate at quality tandoori restaurants in Houston for 20 years. All seem to have excellent tandoori chicken.Voila! This grilling paste is the exact recipe that northern Indian tandoori restaurants use.One tbsp. paste to two tbsp. cooking oil blended then marinate your chicken at least one hour then grill to your taste.
1,Not good quality,I bought this hose to water plants on my New York City terrace. I've been using it maybe one to two days a week maximum. The nozzle never fit right on the spout creating some spray. Then I noticed two weeks ago a small leak in the side of the hose. That small hole has now become a huge hole and the hose had to go in the garbage. I hoped it would last one summer. Worth it to spend a little extra and get better quality.
2,cheap but issues,It leaks. I had to spend a lot of time sealing up all the joints. the hopper on the bottom is a bad design and i have to tip the whole thing to get the media back over to where the hose pick up is. I never thought i woudl say it but i think the harbor freight one is better for the cheap blasting cabinets.
5,"review of ""Speaking as a Professional""","This book is thorough, practical, and inspirational. Although all the chapters were helpful, I found Chapter Seven to be particularly so. The tips for managing anxiety helped me to sail through a recent presentation at a professional writers' conference. In fact, I enjoyed giving the presentation so much that I signed up for an upcoming workshop on ""Getting on the Lecture Circuit."" Thanks to Dan's book, I now have more confidence on the floor and on my feet."
2,a book about the other side of the breachway,"For those who know Weekapaug (The beaches, the Inn, the yacht club , the tennis club), this is not about that. This is Atlantic Avenue , and the beach on the other side of the breachway from Fenway. This is the view from the hoi polloi."
5,An inspiring and welcome contribution to Buddhist Studies.,"John Shane compiles and edits The Crystal And The Way Of Light, considering the spiritual path from the viewpoint of Dzogchen. From the foundations of Dzogchen practices and the author's familiarity with its philosophy and spirituality to symbols of Tibetan meditation and photos of Buddhist masters, this is filled with insights."
5,His best,"This is perhaps Norbu's best and most fun book. It has enough of the magical and wonderful in it to give hope to all who read it. We all have to live our own lives. It is great to be able to read a book of good tidings and hope such as Norbu has done here. Some people have great missions in life, and it seems that writing a great book such as this is Norbu's."
2,More country than rock....,"My dad is friends with the guys in this band. I've heard the album, and have seen them live. They are good musicians, but they can't write a decent song if their life depended on it. Now, if you can get past the American flag album cover, you'll see that this is a solidly baised COUNTRY album. It has a few tints of rock here and there, but for the most part, it's just a Toby Keith album, with distorted guitars, and an occasional solo. Nothing more. They are a decent live band. They need to amps, the feedback was killing my ears."
1,"Shallow, Sappy and Predictable","I actively seek out books that teach good morals, but this one was way over the top sanctimonious. Our protagonist, Shelby, is whiny, weak and simplistic. (Oh, but she's a believer, so that makes it all okay.) Ditto for her love interest, Prince Nick. Dialog is flat, unnatural and preachy. And, really, everyone seems to behave like little automatons, with nothing more to do than wring their hands and pray over our main characters' marriage. I found NO realistic or interesting characters in this book. And while this is an age-old storyline centered around an arraged marriage turned love match, I believe that with (much) more deft handling, it could have been made interesting. Try Lizz Curtis Higgs or Francine Rivers for Christian romance that you can sink your teeth into. ""The Princess"" was little more than stilted dialog interlaced with preaching--a dash of needless fretting thrown in for good measure. Ugh."
4,Modern Romance,"I enjoyed this book. In fact I read it within a day. I didnt look at the book carefully when I bought it so I thought it was a historical romance, when in fact it was a modern day romance. I assume the setting is an imaginary place ""Pendaran"" I havent heard of this place, have you? So this is why you can overlook certain aspects of the book, such as royalty marrying a commoner. I found it similar to ""Who brings forth the Wind"" another Lori Wick novel (actually the only other book I have read of Lori's). So, if you enjoyed that book, I am sure you will enjoy this book. It was nice to slip away from everday life to read this book. What woman doesnt want to be swept away by some Prince?If you like romance and scripture lessons to learn, then this is the book for you."
2,The Princess,This was the first novel I have ever read by Lori Wick. I usually read books by the same Publishing House and I wanted to try something different. I found it to be a disapointment.The story was easy reading but the storyline was predictable. Nothing exciting about it.
2,A disappointment,"This is the first Lori Wick book I have ever read, and I was surprised by how disappointing I found it. It was a good storyline to begin with (the only reason it is not just one star), but it could have been handled much better. The writing was dull and seemed amateurish, the dialog stiff and unnatural (I realize that sometimes that was called for, but it occurred in ALL of it!), the characters perfect---and where's the fun in that? Once again, let me emphasize that I liked the general plot. In the hands of a different writer, or written with a different style, or both, it could have been far more entertaining. Reading this has made me wary of pursuing any more of Wick's novels."
5,i love the princess,"this story is rather original and most importantly it imparts deep spiritual truths about the christian marriage. i read this book before i got engaged and only after i got married, i fully realised its value."
5,"Great book, heart warming and real.","This book shows people who truely love God and seek knowing Him above all else, and how romantic love flows from that."
4,A eye opener for relationships.,"I, too, am an avid Wick fan. I have all she has written and continue to ask the Lord to fill her with stories and help her write faster!! This story, of an arranged marriage between royality and a common family, gives a true picture of what the Lord can do when asked to do His will. Nick and Shelby had to allow the Lord to work a miracle in their lives in order to make their marriage a ""real"" marriage. Patience,honesty and tenderness are the key to this lasting relationship. The Lord truly is soveriegn!"
4,clean literature,I like the Christian emphasis including living in a spiritual way. Lori Wick is an inspiring author who encourages Godly living
5,Excellent book!!!,"Yet another wonderful book by Lori Wick. It was AWESOME, I couldn't put it down! After reading one of her books about a year ago, I've jumped on every chance I get to read another one. My grandmother, mother, and I are always on the look out for any new ""Lori Wick"" novels, so they're perfect for any age. Definately a good choice, but I'm sure any of her books would be enjoyed greatly!"
4,"Provocative, tender, captivating!",I am reading this book on tape for the blind. In my mind's eye I was instantly at the location of the story. This is why I know the listeners of these tapes will love it. I did.
3,Disapointed,"I wanted to like this story, I really did. There was just something missing though. By the end of the story, I didn't even like Shelby. At the beginning, I didn't think Nick deserved Shelby, but by the time I had finished it, I didn't think Shelby deserved Nick. She just lost her personality in the end; she was blah.The story is a little slow, but it has its moments. Some were cute, but some were cheesy (""Am I pretty Nick?"" ""No... you're beautiful"" - I had to roll my eyes at that one). I thought that Ms. Wick dealt with the couple's intimacy in a tasteful way, but I didn't like her approach to it.This book was enjoyable, but I just wasn't satisfied in the end."
2,love versus reality,"i really liked this book,im one person who still believes in true love,first kisses and i was drawn.ive experienced so many authors from francine rivers to lori wick. a rating of 2 mans to me that there was room for improvmnt. she still did a very good job but its jus fiction i believe. some of the examples used where unrealstic,we all now perfect but one thing we should strive for is Being like Jesus and i get that.nowhere in the book did anyone ever get angry or complain to God when sometimes its something we do. i think some of this books are not truly realistic thats why many people have something to say..but at the end of the day deep down we all earning for that type of guy and maybe he will come. i love emtions show more of them!!"
4,The Princess,Held my interest but was slow going and predictable in the end. Yet I thoroughly enjoyed the book.
5,Delightful!,"Th Princess is one of my favorite books by Lori Wick! The book has a fairy-tale type of quality that makes it so enchanting! Yet there is more to it than that. Its about a prince who is grieving his late wife when his parents (the king and queen of Faraday) decide its time for a new princess because of laws that say the prince must be married by a certain age. So the king and queen are in much prayer about who should become the next princess, when a dear friend of theirs thinks he has found the perfect girl. That girl is Shelby Parker. I would tell you more about it but I wouldn't want to ruin it for you. This is a book that you must read! It is simply delightful!"
3,Mildly enjoyable; L.Wick's other books are better.,"The concept of a modern day European type royalty set in a fictitious country is just so-so. I think I was disappointed because I have really enjoyed most of her other books and this one was only ""ok"""
2,a little bit too unrealistic,"I've always loved Lori Wick's writing, and expected the same when I read this book. However, I found it to be a very shallow book. No thinking was required to read the book. It was a ""fluff"" book. I thought the setting was rather fake, and didn't seem like real life. I also found it hard to believe that a prince would marry a citizen that had no royal blood whatsoever. I could maybe understand it if her uncle was a duke or something, but she was just a normal person. It also seemed like everyone in the country were christians, which does not happen in the real world. I would definitely classify it as escape fiction. Altogether a disappointment."
5,Gently told modern princess love story,"I love this book! I know many readers take issue with the modern fairy tale setting, but it works. Shelby is a kindhearted, gentle, sweet young woman of faith who agrees to an arranged marriage with a widower prince only a few years older than her. At first, Nikolai wants nothing to do with her as he grieves the memory of his first wife, but as he sees her interact with his family and their subjects, slowly his heart begins to soften.It's romantic. It has solid Christian values. I've read this book several times and I'm sure I'll read it again and again over the years."
2,Not as good as some...,"From the first Lori Wick book I read, I was hooked. I have bought all of her recent books, but I wish I had waited to borrow THE PRINCESS. It was a good read, pleasant and easy, but it didn't give me the chills like her California Series or Kensington Chronicles. It didn't seem as though she spent as much time in developing the plot and characters as she has in the past."
3,"Sweet, a good escape from reality","I liked this book and enjoyed reading it. I did not fall in love with the characters as I have in other books past. I am not anxiously waiting to see if the next book will be a second edition as I have with her other titles. It is a good romance and escape from reality and I like the characters even though I am not caught up with them completely while I am reading like I have been for ""Sophie"" or the characters in _The Place Called Home Series_. It is an enjoyable story though. I like the prince-princess storyline but wished it could have been a little more adventurous for them, or a little more intense with their feelings about situations that came up and how they finally realize their love for one another."
4,The Princess,"The Princess is a good read, but if you are expecting dungeons and knights and such and such, you don't really get that. However, it is an intriguing storyline. I would recommend it to anyone. In the Princess, the princess and prince have a hard time getting on the same wave length with one another when it comes to love, but by the end they get there. You will have to find out how on your own. At some points, I thought I would never see them together happily, but it finally ended and I wanted a sequel of their life together. It is a very good read."
2,A Simple Novel,"In terms of language and composition, this novel starves for artistry. Being written in third person, I see no reason for such pedantic language. I will give credit to the authoress however for being understandable. Too often in novels is the reader so swept away in flourishes of language, that they miss the plot entirely.The plot itself was not terrible, and it had some worthy ideas on the subjects of love and personal growth. Some of the character developments I found to be rather unbelievable even given the setting, but this is merely a matter of opinion.Also, though I realize that this novel was most likely written for a strongly Christian audience, I feel that it alienated, almost callously, any reader who doesn't belive, accept or wavers from what I would call orthodox Christian beliefs. Being very open-minded in this regard, this overriding attitude certainly ruined any aspect of the novel I might have enjoyed."
2,Writing does not measure up.,"It is written like a simple every day letter, with the same complexity and art. Not much better than a non-writer like you and I would do if we came up with a story. I do give it credit though, for some wonderful messages to live by. Ms. Wick would do better by writing books that teach how to live by the word of Our God, than writing novels.I really feel that we Christians don?t do ourselves any favors by giving high ratings to books simply to ?do good?, because it deceives others about the quality, and into spending money on a disappointment. I feel that we need to rate Christian writers same as we would anything else."
3,The Princess,"I rarely have time to read books anymore, but a friend recomended that i read it. I thought it was good, i finished it in 2 days. I thought that it was pretty stupid how the character was kind of like ""the perfect girl"" and ""the handsome prince"". I don't like reading books with too much religiousness to it though. I did enjoy it because it was fiction, to get away from reality."
4,Not for teenage christian girls?,"ok I'm 14 and I loved this book it did have some problems but for the most part I loved it. Wick could have written it better but I think it was ok. there was some intimacy and things but for the most part G-rated, my pastors wife let her daughters (12,14,15) read it and even suggested it to me!!"
5,WONDERFUL,"The Princess is a great book! I love the characters in this book, and the storyline is just awesome. It's about a young woman named Shelby, who agrees to have an arranged marrige with Prince Nikolai. After they get married Shelby struggles to get close to the prince, and the prince tries to stay away from her a first. I can't tell any more because it might ruin the book, but I strongly reccomend this book for people who like romance."
5,"Wonderful, Excellant, Could not put it down!!!!","Although I have been a Christian for almost 20 years, most of my reading has been fantasy and science fiction. Recently I have found that I much prefer books by Christian Authors. I was browsing, looking to see if Tim LeHaye's Applyon was available in paper back yet, when I saw The Princess available. I took it home and read it that night, despite a very early, busy tomorrow. Ms. Wick's characters are beleivable and her writing style is a pleasure. Her description of the falling in love of her heroine and hero was thorougly enjoyable. I can't wait to read her earlier works!!!!"
5,A Moving Romance Novel,"This book is so real and touching I did not put it down until 4:00 in the morning. I completely felt for Princess Shelby through her tough times getting to know the prince. And then!-how they fell in love so slowly and surely, it was all I could do to not cry. This book is so moving and powerful I would recommend it to anyone looking for a diehard romance/Christian novel."
3,not the same as pictured,"i purchased this set for my son who is very interested in juggling. the package we received had 3 juggling pins, 3 balls and 4 rings. there were no scarves or juggling plate. he is still enjoying it though and doesn't want to return it but beware the package might not contain everything that was pictured."
2,juggling,"Half of the things in this kit are easy and fun to use. the other half are hard to use, even worse for kids."
3,Should have been good value for the money...,"Bought this for my 10-year old son who likes to juggle and spin plates. Should have been a good bang for the buck. There's a big problem with the spinning plate. It's *very* hard to spin it. My son got so frustrated with it so I bought a spinning plate and stick from Amazon seller MagicGeek Juggling Store (product was very good and seller got excellent service, see my review). At first, we thought the problem is with the short, soft plastic stick that came with it but when he tried that same stick with the new plate, all went well. We found out that the real problem is with the spinning plate. It's shape, size and quality is different from the new one which spins perfectly.If you want to buy this, just pretend that a spinning plate is not included or else you'll get frustated too. Should have been a good buy if not for that stupid plate."
4,The juggling plate takes some know-how,"Length:: 1:32 MinsEight-year-old Elizabeth has attended many magic camps and is a good juggler as well as a plate spinner. She has this kit and thought she'd share how to spin the plate successfully. Additionally, if you are learning to juggle, the scarves are the easiest place to start."
2,Not As Pictured and CHEAP!,"I purchased this set as a gift for a new juggler. I was really disappointed because the juggling set did not come with the scarves or the spinning plate. The stuff it did come with was super cheap! I didn't have really high expectations, but I at least hoped to receive what was pictured and equipment that one could juggle. I am a very experienced juggler and was not even able to juggle the pins. They were too light, flimsy, and not properly balanced. It is really too bad because I bought it primarily because of the pins. The rings are okay....there are four of them which I thought was strange. The balls are okay as well, but are made for small hands. This might be an okay gift for really young kids learning to juggle, but not for anyone else. I don't understand how kids can learn using this equipment when seasoned jugglers have so much trouble using it. All in all, I do not recommend this product. If you want to learn to juggle, use a few tennis balls."
4,Set Review,"These are great. The juggling balls fall apart in not very long, but can be fixed very easily with tape, string, etc.The rings are fun to use and are not going to break without abuse. The spinning plate is terrible. The manual tells you how to get it going, but it does not work. The handkerchiefs aren't worth practicing and are not any good for juggling. The clubs are excellent. They are nice to hold and are great weight. The clubs will take years of beating.I hope you found this review useful, and thank you for reading."
2,Not very good.,Cheaply made. The juggling balls were awful. They are more like cubes than balls. Spinning plate was useless. Stick used for the plate was wobbly plastic. The rings and scarves are OK. Clubs are just toys and not very good. Booklet was OK.
2,Does the job,"It works. Don't know why the screw isn't fastened in; it turns and lowers when you're screwing it in which makes no sense, and if you're not careful it will disappear (I can stick a finger in and twist it back out, but if you have fat fingers you'll be out of luck.) If it weren't for that I'd give it a 5 star, but that seems annoying enough to lose 2 stars. I still use it and will continue to use it.UPDATE: Used this thing again, and I came back to take off another star. I'll probably wind up taking off another star next time I use it. It is terrible. Why on earth would they not have the screw be fixed? Worst design ever. I see no benefit to it."
2,Unfortunate caricature,"This book is far from horrible, and it does (however vaguely) make the point that fat people should be allowed to love and accept themselves as they are, however Myrtle's character is depicted as such a stereotypical caricature that much of the potentially positive message is lost. Myrtle is sloppy often to the point of being disgusting, and eats voraciously and obsessively; there is even a reference to her throwing her bloated stomach ""over her shoulder"" when it gets in her way. These comments are ugly and unnecessary, and turn Myrtle into a grotesque oddity. Overall, for a quick read (I finished it in a couple of hours) this book is bearable, but there are far better (and more positive) novels dealing with weight issues out there... I recommend Venise Berry's ""All of Me."""
4,Good for younger sibling's to be,"I really like this book only a few comment's about it. I would have liked for mum and dad to have to ring grandad and grandma or the neighbours in the middle of the night when baby arrives as in most set ups where a new sibling is due to arrive there is not ""in house"" baby sitting service available, and this is a point that is very important to get across. The book is great it makes a lovely read and has some great drawings that you can spend a lot of time talking about and I loved the fact that mummy is breastfeeding baby rather than bottle feeding. I would reccommend it to anyone with a young toddler and expecting again.."
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased this adapter to utilize both RCA inputs of my subwoofer from a single LFE output on my receiver (Tannoy, the subwoofer manufacturer claims that this augments the bass output from the sub). Since I know that adding connectors always generates some loss of signal I wanted to use a high end, premium connector to minimize this loss.The problem with this connector was that the male RCA plugs fit very loosely into the female RCA jacks on the sub. Every time I moved the sub to adjust a setting the connectors came loose, generating grating feedback from the speaker. I subsequently tried two other adapters, including a $1.99 cheapie and the fit to the sub jacks was tight and true - i.e. the problem was with the Monster adapter, NOT the sub jacks. This was not the performance I expected from a high priced, supposedly premium product."
5,Steer your career out of a dead end without being overwhelmed,Outstanding book. If you are in a position where you see your current project heading into a dead end and are trying to turn around and steer your career in a new direction but do not know where to start then this is the book for you. Extremely helpful but also an easy read.
1,Definitely Disappointing,"I am pretty nervous about posting a negative review. I have to, however, be honest about my experience with this book. My girls hated it. I found the book dull, tedious and repetitive. Neither the story nor the telling lives up to the hype. I was not impressed by the shallow character development or the simplicity of the dialog. What bothered me most was half cooked (if that) attempt at a plot line. The characters lacked personality and the supposedly educational parts were cringe worthy. Kids don't need to be beaten over the head with lessons either."
1,Not recommended,"The book Dragonfly and the Web of Dreams did not pertain to my likings as a reader. To me it did not make much sense. I felt that the author's writing style was very poor, therefore making the book not very much fun to read. It was hard to relate to the book and understand where the characters were because the author did not really explain or elaborate on these topics. Not recommended."
4,A new genre,"In his first novel author Donald Birchfield may have created a new genre - a madcap combination of suspense, Indian history and military farce. A member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma and a professor of Native American Studies at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, Birchfield is known by his peers as a man of dry wit and expertise in Choctaw history.One wishes to have read Birchfield's soon-to-be published history of the Choctaws before reading Field of Honor, for it would surely enrich the cunningly imparted Choctaw history in this book. But it's not just history Birchfield imparts, but a witty lampoon on whites, academia, Christians, the military and even, at times, Choctaws. It's a wild ride, one that only the author of ""The Oklahoma Basic Intelligence Test, and Other New and Collected Elementary, Epistolary, Autobiographical, and Oratorical Choctologies"" could conceive of."
1,Look elsewhere!,"They put 1.1 on the cover, but left it out of the book! The book is poorly written and full of mistakes. If you want to learn Java, spend your money on another book."
2,Skip It!,"Skip this one, especially if you really want to learn 1.1.The text is fairly easy to read, but it has not really been updated for 1.1. Also, there are numerous mistakes in the quizzes (and elsewhere)."
3,Superficial,"Although the title of the book is ""Java 1.1 Interactive Course"" it does not handle Java 1.1 except as supplements, I do not recommend it for people who want to learn 1.1There are some glaring errors - on p 118 it says that the loop test in a for loop is carried out after each pass of the loop! On page 141 main() does not instantiate the class Car. Some more care in proof reading is called for.The chapters on abstract classes and interfaces are very short, and remain abstract.The form of the quizzes as multiple choice questions isn't very good for learning - small exercises would be much more effective"
1,Poorly written,I was looking through this in a bookstore to see if it would be a good recommendation for a friend wanting to learn java. Save your money. Lemay turns simple concepts into convoluted blather. There are better books with fewer errors.
1,Anyone who buys this book should have his/her head examed!,"1. This book contains too many erors. most examples do not work. 2. It has NO JAVA 1.1 in it. 3.How it got published is a mystery. Anyone wants to learn JAVA needs to look elsewhere. this one SUCKS! To Laura (the author) Do this world a favor,write about things you really know and write less. T.I.A"
1,Terrible service and outcome,"I am not rating the product, because I never got it to operate in my computer. It was the wrong part and did not fit.My biggest problem was with the distributor, who after recommending the product refused to accept return, because I had opened the product to install it and therefore harmed the original packaging which made it ""unsaleable"".My e-mail inquires were ignored."
4,Fire and Rescue - Review,This book is a must for all firefighters past and present. This book contains great detail of the UK fire services with great pictures.Sally Holloway and Neil Wallington are brilliant authors on fire and rescue matter and are excellent at producing books together.A real good read!
1,Unsafe Radio,"I purchased this radio recently and had to return it as the weather band did not work. I received the replacement radio and found the same problem along with the fact that the flashlight did not fuction. I live close to the Weather station repeater and receive a strong signal on my other units. I rasied the antenna, shortened it, etc. ran it off the batteries, crank to no avail. It is pretty scary considering this unit has the NOAA alert built in. I have sent an email to GPX regarding this and am awaiting a reply. Honestly, I may have received a bad unit from a batch; however, I do not know how that could be. In any case, I would not recommend this radio, especially if you are depending on weather alerts or reports. Oh, yeah, the back-lit display does not work with the crank batteries, only with the 6 AA batteries you must install. Way to go GPX, another fine product..........."
4,Good for under $30,"I looked at a lot of emergency radios and this one came out on top. The weather station in Los Angeles comes in crystal clear, even running off just the dynamo. The hand crank is sturdy enough. The radio works well, but it works best with the batteries in it. The tuner is sensitive, but once you get it on a station, it sticks. The flashlight is OK. The emergency siren is OK. The back battery panel is going to pop open if you drop it. Although this product is multi-purpose, in a real emergency I will only care about the hand crank, the flashlight, and the weather (emergency broadcast) station."
2,Like it BUT..,"It does not keep the coffee hot for long. It keeps it ""luke warm"" but not hot. I love the mug and keep putting hot coffee in it to keep it warm."
5,Trudeau desk mug,"My husband and I drink coffee out of these mugs every morning. They keep our coffee hot while we eat breakfast. I like there are no openings in the top because the heat is maintained. I also like the stability of the cup, most coffee mugs are easily tipped over.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7XECS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,"What's He Doing, Mommy?","This book explains the mass in simple and clear terms, with an insight that would be helpful for casual Catholics too. My French grandson-age 4- was fascinated by the celebration of Mass during a recent visit.He insisted that his mom explain everything that the Priest said. I bought this book so that he and his little sister could remember our religious celebration. Both of the kids love this book and insist that my daugther read it to them most nights."
1,Not for those who prefer more traditional mass,"Not recommended for those who prefer more traditional, reverent type of mass. It is for those who like the mass more as a social gathering, and not as holy sacrifice, and want their kids to think that way. The priest starts mass by saying loud 'Good morning everyone', then choir performs with guitars, and Sign of Peace where everyone tries to hand shake as many people as possible."
4,Helpful for Pre school,"This is good, but too old for my 2 year old granddaughter. Probably better for Kindergarten age."
2,Not a Missal,"A good book to add to the church bag, but definitely not structured a missal and harder for my younger kids to follow along during Mass since it's wordy. I like the friendly pictures and tone, however. It's a good book, just not recommended if you're looking for a book that will help the kids follow along with Mass."
1,Modernist tale of the New Mass,Don't waste your money on this ultra-modern look at the Mass from 1970 onward. The felt banners on the cover should give you a clue as to what the author thinks is an devout and reverant liturgy.
2,Poor Format-Generic Activities,"I was excited to order this book, but found myself very disappointed after opening it. I skimmed through it maybe twice and have had no desire to look at it since. The format of the book is poor (in my opinion), most of the activities are corny and anything but creative, and everything about the book seems outdated. There is no color, pictures, or examples on any of the pages. The majority of the activities are generic and lacking in creativity. I have not used one activity from the book yet. I still can't figure out how they managed to fill so many pages with such bland theme activities."
2,GOOD but NOT GREAT,I really do find this book helpful but was sadly disappointed to find that it didn't have enough activities for 2 yr olds.. If you are teaching children 3 or older I think you will love it.. I have recommended it to my friend who teachs preschool.. But if you are a toddler teacher I would recommend to search for something that has mostly toddler activities..
5,Interest Sparked!,"I so enjoyed this book. It kept my interest like a sparkler on a warm summer night. The theme and storyline was exciting, because it was about my home town, Akron, Ohio. The fact that my picture was in the book, was a very pleasant surprise! Thank you!"
5,Vero and Philippe,I think Vero and Philippe is a great book. I really enjoyed all of the adventures that they had. I really liked how Vero let her pet snail Thor free in an orchard. Philippe turns out to be a nice older brother when he takes the blame for the practical joke that they play on their parents to get their maid Francine back. I would reccommend this book to kids and adults.
3,Panasonic Ribbon for KX-P1624 1654 2624 and 3624 (Black,Purchase was a long long long time ago. Can't imagine why it is up for me to review now.Ribbons have worked well and were purchased at someone elses request
4,Dall Sheep Hunting,"Having hunted all kinds of sheep throughout Alberta, British Columbia and the NWT, I found Tony Russ's book to be both refreshing and comprehensive. He has done an outstanding job of describing every salient aspect of hunting these magnificient animals. His style of writing is warm and genuine, and his ability of describing the things that apparently happen to every sheep hunter is superb.If you have ever hunted these amazing sheep, or even thought about it, I would urge you to read this book."
5,Sheep Hunting in Alaska: The Dall Sheep Hunters Guide,"Never having hunted before I moved to Alaska, I sought information from guides and shooters on whom to read for the best information on hunting Alaska. Everyone I spoke to agreed: read Tony Russ first, last, always. From how to dress (""cotton kills""), to what to carry, he covers it in an easily readable style. Having read his books before each hunt helped refine my techniques, and helped me to secure my prey on every one of my hunts. This book should be required reading of every hunter on his or her way to Alaska."
5,Greg and Steve CD,"The kids LOVE the Movement Melody, they call it the Pony Song! It's a GREAT cd for kids to dance and sing to. This was actually a second purchase of the EXACT cd, the other one was so old it didn't play anymore from all the wear and tear! = )"
1,These boots are NOT suede!,"Though they are advertised as imported suede boots, these boots are made of some sort of plastic! ALL MAN MADE MATERIALS is printed plainly on the bottom of the shoe.BEWARE - FALSE ADVERTISING!!NEWPORT NEWS has been alerted and they are ""very sorry."""
1,"If you read her column, you've read the book.","The information is pedantic and dated; much of it is a compilation of Fisher's Fortune columns. While it might be appropriate for someone with no knowledge of the workplace, it is a rehash of concepts from other authors. ""First, Break All the Rules"" by Buckingham and Coffman is a far better resource."
1,Not Functional,These do not work well at all. Even the largest dot is unable to hold up a 4 X 6 photo on the frig. I would recommend to stick to the standard mighty magnets which are terrific.
3,why waste $15 when...,"...you can buy the Phillips RCA Y-adapter for $4? Amazon carries the Phillips too, save your money and buy a pizza instead with the $10.Monster Cable might be good for speaker wiring if you're an audiophile with actual supersensitive audiophile eardrums, but otherwise it's just a huge marketing gimmick."
4,A good overall movie,"This is a very good educational documentary about the break through that are occurring in studying some of life's mysteries through the use of DNA. I found the film to be informative about the research work being done to unlock some of the secrets that Darwin was not able to answer in his publication on the origin of the species. However, during some parts of the film I got lost in the discussion about the role DNA is playing helping to find answers to some of life's mysteries. After awhile the DNA discussion was just too hard for me to follow. I would recommend this film for those in the education field to show to their students."
4,Interesting documentary on fractals,"This was a very interesting documentary, I didn't know too much about fractals and was totally unaware that these mathematics had so many potential applications in the study of the natural world. The history of their use in computer graphics and electrical engineering was fascinating. My only beef is that I feel too much time in this documentary is spent trying to show that mathematics is ""cool"" (as opposed to ""square"") and ""the same as art"" when, personally, I'm more interested in the history of the subject and its various useful applications. If you can show me something is useful, you don't have to try to show me that it's ""cool"", that's a given."
2,Extremely basic,"this is a PBS - NOVA dvd not even for beginners. Nothing of the mathematical concept, of the degree of fractality, of the graphs and equations that make it simpler to understand and even define a fractal. Do not waste yor time and money."
3,Good Presentation,"This series was certainly informative, especially the section on hox genes :) Random mutations and natural selection are becoming more and more interesting, especially in the holy quest to find the source of biological information. This movie explicated Darwin's theory nicely, and its subsequent revisions as they apply to modern day discoveries. I'm a creationist, but I found this movie very nicely done. Good job."
3,OK,"this one is just ok for me, I liked another one better for my interests..........but it might fit another person really well, so try it"
2,Are you STILL joking?,"Here we go again, another propaganda movie trying to disprove I.D. Will you guys ever get honest, or at the very least correct your records of so-called facts. I am tried of your hidden agenda!!! The sad fact is when an evolution ""truth"" is clearly shown to be a falsification of fact (Piltdown Man, ETC... I could go on and on and on) you guys seldom, if ever, step up to the plate and correct yourselves. I am reminded of Politicians or Micheal Moore when I watch your movies. I gave you two stars for the photography/video work, but I give you two thumbs down for truth. Sadly, I don't know how to show the ""thumbs down"" here."
5,Heartrending,This is a heartrending tale about innocent and unsung victims of war. All decent Americans should view them with the sympathy they deserve and help where possible.
1,Arizona Kid,"The Arizona KidThe film itself is a must for anybody interested in the history of western movies. This version however was a tremendous disappointment, as the voices were not in sync with the actors' mouths. The synchronization was off by a few seconds at the beginning of the film, but by the end of the film it was many seconds. Often, the person whose voice the viewer hears is not even on the screen, and it is completely disconcerting. A complete fiasco (I really should return it!).If you want to see a typical Roy Rodgers film, this is probably a good one, but do not buy this version."
4,Really worth reading,"This book gave me a new look into greek art. I have read a lot of books about this period and I found that Robin Osborne added new viewpoints. I liked his style of writing, it invited me to read on."
3,Worth buying if Stargate fan,I love ben browder in farscape far better than I like him in Stargate. I guess I just a Jack O'Neill fan to appreciate his character and the changes in the team. Overall the movie was good and is worth having if you are a SG-1 fan.
4,Fitting End To Season 10,"Stargate - The Ark of TruthEnjoyed watching a better finali to this Superior Sci-Fi Series than that presented on the Small Screen in ""Unending"". This DVD wrapped up most of the unanswered questions left open in the Series. An appearance by RDA would have been great but only if it would have fit the Story Line. All the Characters in this Series I loved, some I was sorry to see go. Glad Michael Shanks returned, it wasn't quite the same without him.I would rate this DVD a must see for any Stargate SG-1 Fan but also any fan of Sci-Fi as well.Looking forward to any Medium that keeps these Characters and the Stargate in circulation.To SG-1 ""a Job Well Done""."
3,The Ark,I was so excited knowing it was on it's way. I thought it was going to closing the chapter on the Ori but it really only left me with more questions. Maybe the next one will be more helpful. If you are a fan like me as long as they keep coming I will keep watching.
3,A Critical Review,"Sorry to break up the love fest. I am a Stargate Fan and was pumped about this dvd release. Unfortunately, The Ark of Truth is just so-so.Don't worry no spoilers in this review. The movie will give you a temporary ""SG-1 fix"". I'm not sure that it's worth buying the dvd though. The writing was average. Same story different show... find the artifact, figure out the ancient magic, defeat the enemy after a superhuman effort, save the day. The special effects were pretty good. The absence of Richard Dean Anderson has really hurt Stargate in general."
5,Awesome!,Great SG1 movie! Loved it all! Awesome to see all the characters in something new! Hope there are lots more to come!
5,Stargate SG1: The Ark of Truth,"I just received the DVD today. I have been a huge fan of Stargate since the original movie. I was very dissapointed when SciFi channel cut SG1, especially since they replaced it whith ECW. Of course, now I do not watch SciFi channel that much. Just to see Stargate Atlantis and a couple other shows.The movie The Ark of Truth should be a huge success. It is well acted and the music score is outstanding. I was on the edge of my seat for nearly the whole movie as things went from bad to worse for SG1. Before seeing that there is another movie pending, I was concerned that SG1 was going to get killed off in a way similar to what was done to Farscape. Fortunately this did not happen, though I thought one of the SG1 Team would be killed off at a couple points during the movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes SciFi and especially to any Stargate SG1 fan."
2,Really two TV episodes - not really a movie,"The Ori plotline was pretty lame to begin with, but this 'conclusion' is even more so. Thank goodness we're past the Ori and somebody more creative can write some new Stargate plots.The 'ark' as a (completely) magic pill was beyond absurd and what leads to my two star rating. Very good (but not cinematic) production values, acting, special effects, etc - but basically, this was a two-part TV show that should have been at least a half hour longer in order to provide some believable story line for the ark itself. The cost for a two-TV-episode-equivalent DVD seems pretty high, given my disappointment in the plot. But considering that DVD sales are their only revenue to pay for the production, I suppose I shouldn't complain. Still, I would recommend that most either rent this or wait for it to be shown on TV..."
4,Legend,"Nice visual job; clearly for fans like me who enjoy the storyline. Overdid the music, though."
4,Ark of Truth,"I have enjoyed Stargate SG-1 since it started. The only disappointment I had in the movie was that Jack O'Neil (Richard Dean Anderson) was not in it. I like Ben Browder, but no one can hold a candle to Anderson. That is my only complaint. I thought the movie was well done, moving right along as far as the action went. I hope there is another movie in the offing and that RDA will be in the cast!"
2,"It passed the time, but....","I looked forward to ""The Ark of Truth"", but, to be honest, it was a disappointment. In my opinion, the only real purpose of the strangely disconnected replicator sub-plot was to pad the whole thing out to the length of a feature film. Without the replicators, the whole thing could have fitted into a normal SG1 episode. Heck - that's probably how it started out, before the TV series got canned. They tried to jazz up the replicators with animated skeletons but I wasn't fooled. Those replicators looked *tired*.... :-(On the positive side, the main plot was more interesting, and I liked the new, hot-looking (big grin) Adria. But I felt her final clash with Morgan le Fay was a bit inconclusive."
3,Wrapped up the Ori saga,"Like most Stargate crap I could have written better if they just gave me a general plot line to follow. Despite the poor writing and lack of engrossing plot twists, it was a predictable yet good movie. Stargate usually delivers that average quality that gets a viewer to come back for 10 years strait. Good job overall."
4,Rounds it off nicely,Rounded the story off nicely that was kind of left hanging at the end of the final Stargate SG1 series.
3,Nice SG1 Fix - But Flawed,"Glad I bought it and my kid and I will certainly watch this again and again but...I have to agree with the issues previously stated. Still, great production values and an entertaining video. I do think they did a credible job of killing off this story line which was a poor substitute for those nasty Goauld. Looking forward to the next one, with Baal and the bad guy (I think) and I hope they make enough cash on these to keep them coming.(If the cast are still into it)"
1,"Stargate was once a wonderful show, now it's just repetitive drivel","I used to love Stargate. But maybe it was the departure of Richard Dean Anderson, I don't know. But the last few seasons have been extremely repetitive and tiresome. Random Ancient artifact saves the day. The Ark of Truth is no exception. The only character that gets any decent character development is Tomin when he has a change of heart. Otherwise it's the same ole tired formula. 1) Find Ancient artifact. 2) magically decipher it despite how ridiculously old and advanced it is. 3) Save the day. 4) Lather rinse repeat. It was bad enough that the first seasons of Stargate dealt with Humans miraculously defeating an enemy that was vastly more advanced and had been in power for thousands of years. But my suspension of disbelief simply cannot tolerate simple humans fighting virtual deities and somehow winning. It is extremely disappointing to see Stargate fall so far."
2,Great Movie -- Not Enough Answered Questions,"Ok, The Movie is great very impressed with it i hope there is a lot of extras on the real DVD that i already ordered. there is not enough answered questions they answer 1 question out of 10 years of star gate. they do not explain anything about Cam they do not explain much about anything else."
5,Satisfying,"This movie tied up the loose ends of the series very well. It was a satisfying conclusion to the final season. Good effects and well written, IMO."
5,Great Movie - Looking forward to the next one.,"I'm sure the critics will hate it, but I loved the series and loved the opportunity to see the team in action again. I can't wait until the next movie. Maybe if these sell well, they might resurrect the series. Again."
4,Great end to the Ori story,"I felt The Ark of Truth was a great finale to the Ori storyline, however the movie was too short and seemed like a long season finale rather than a motion picture caliber movie. The acting was top of the line Stargate SG-1 fare but I wasn't impressed with the use of replicators as a catalyst in the story. The ""Terminator"" also made it more cheesy because the replicators could have just made multiple Terminators without the need for human tissue. Why stay in a crab-like form all the time? It is in my humblest opinion that Continuum was a much more polished story, primarily because The Ark of Truth was a quick finish to the Ori storyline. For the Trekkies, the actual Ark of Truth was really an ""Adjust the Heisenburg"" matrix style solution to a problem. I highly recommend watching The Ark of Truth just so you get closure for SG-1 prior to Sci-Fi's cancellation of the series."
4,Why end the series?,"This was a nice enough continuation of the series but seems to lack some of the polish one would equate with a film. Granted there is more time designated for plot evolution and a bigger budget for effects but it lacked the 'wow' factor.That said, I enjoyed the plot, the effects, the fact there weren't commercials and that Jack O'Neill was back with the group (you can't ever have enough pithy humor or cake!). It was well worth the cost of admission for a dedicated SG1 fan."
3,Love Stargate..a little less for the ARK,"Stargate will always be a great series...no question about that. Unfortunately, this DVD misses being more than a hurried attempt at wrapping up some loose ends. So many loose ends that none get fair treatment, and it ruins the story. Locations were great, same quality production values, but just not put together. So sad to say it, but true."
3,Another minor let down,I think the writers were trying to milk the show with these last couple movie releases. The series was better but these are still worth a watch. Just do not expect too much and it will all be good.
3,Spoiler: Nothing Original Here...sigh.,"I'm a great SG-1 fan and have everything from the Role-playing game to all ten seasons. Unfortunately I was very disappointed in the Ark of Truth. There was nothing new. Nothing even creative. The worst part for me was bringing back the Replicators. These creatures were already beat to death and here they served only as a means to give SG-1 something to blow up.The main characters had virtually nothing to do in the movie. Sam spent her time blowing stuff up. Tilk, nothing but looking tough. Daniel, Vala...bit parts while special affects and the ancients saved the day. As a collector of SG-1 stuff I had to purchase it. As a movie...well, it's a pretty lame attempt to recreate the glory times of the series."
2,Disappointing...,"Bellow the quality of single episodes. A reviewer in this page called it ""a series of random scenes mixed together"". Add to it that the link between the scenes is weak at best. Even the scenes are poorly conceived. In one occasion a crew fires hundreds of round of military munitions aboard the spaceship without putting a single scratch to the ship. In another one, 2 men move a rock-slab of a several tons by just pushing it. Not to mention Teal'c miraculous marathon, ran at a speed compared to a spaceship. There is some entertainment value, specially considering the link to the TV series. And that is why I gave it more than Zero."
1,More Stuntmen should have been lit on fire,"Not the best thing to come out of the Stargate world, but not hideously awful(but close). Could have been an episode if they had taken out some of the pointless middle 'plotlines'. Made me miss Jack and I still don't like Carter's new hair. The best part was the behind the scene part where they show how they have a gel coating they can put on a stuntman and then light them on fire with a blow torch and not hurt them-at all. That is awesome-better then anything in this movie."
3,So is this the end?,"I'm disappointed in the direction that the series has taken. I won't buy another ""Movie"" continuation of Stargate, until it has Movie quality. This was nothing more than a long episode. And they also didn't seem to have the same energy as they once did. Maybe they should just give it up and concentrate on the Atlantis spin off."
4,Necessary wrap up for the tv series,"This isn't really a stand alone movie. It's actually the wrap up for the TV series that SCI FI stupidly cancelled (yet has wrestling, that makes sense). The plot in this movie was actually intended to be the last three episodes of season ten and the first three episodes of season 11. Then the show got cancelled so they held off production and those watching the series never had a wrap-up. What does this mean for the viewer. It means that if you weren't watching the series, you may not get a whole lot out of the movie because it relies heavily on what viewers have been watching for the last 10 seasons. If you're looking for a stand alone wait for the next one."
5,Love it! Gotta have it!,"Finally an answer to the ORI question..great acting, great CG, much bigger than the show...Bring back Stargate!!!"
4,Better than I expected,"After reading a few other reviews about The Ark of Truth, I was concerned my husband and I would not enjoy it when we viewed it. However - I was wrong. It was a great wrap-up of the whole Ori story line. We felt like SG1 picked up right where they'd left off. We were delighted, and can't wait until the next Stargate SG-1 DVD comes out!"
3,ok as a series ender,"Had to buy it to see how the Ori story arc ended. Would have been great as the series finale for Stargate SG-1, but not a stand-alone movie. Sort of a clever business move to end the series with a cliff-hanger, and then release the final episode on DVD - but...."
3,Stargate the ark of truth,"An ok movie, but more like two regular season episodes strung together. Over priced but I will still purchase the sequel because I loved the show and want to see how the story lines end."
5,Great ending to series,Although I hate to see this series end this was a great way to end the series. They movie was true stargate and did not disappoint in any way.A must have for any SG1 fan.
3,Stargate - The Ark of Truth,didn't do what it says on the tin. It was supposed to answer outstanding questions and add closure to the end of series 10 but does not deliver on its promises
4,Pretty good,"The Ark of Truth was about what I expected. The special effects were good, the story picked up where the SG-1 series left off. The only thing that I thought was missing was more depth. Perhaps if it had been longer and more developed I would have felt more satisfied. Overall, pretty good, though, for us ""Gate"" fans."
3,Good movie for Stargate SG-1 fans,"""The Ark of Truth"" finishes the Ori story arc when season 10 of Stargate SG-1 ended its run on SciFi. For non-Stargate watchers, the movie might get a little confusing. For Stargate watchers, it's a very nice way to continue the beloved series.There are plenty of things to like about the movie. Excellent visual effects, nice battle scenes with Ori followers, as well as a wink and a nod to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" on occasion, make this a step above the average show episode. And yes, the Ori story arc is finally closed.What's not to like? No big battle between the Ancients and the Ori, Carter suddenly becoming less efficient and a lot more girly, yet another over-the-top IOA guy, and last but not least the ""resurrection"" of a long defeated enemy. And oh yeah, no Jack O'Neill.Overall, the good points outweigh the bad and I would recommend this movie."
4,Good to see SG-1 again,If your a Stargate fan you will love this show. The visuals are stunning and the story was interesting. I can not help but feel that this film should have been the how the TV series (SC-FI Channel) finished instead of the final episode that was shown. I know there is another direct to dvd movie coming soon and I look forward to that. Hopefully this will be the first of many direct to dvd SG-1 episodes :O)
2,ark of truth ??,"what a disappointing end to a great series . Yet another quick and pathetic attempt to tie up loose ends . lets hope they don,t do the same to Battlestar Galactica. It would truly be a pleasant surprise to see a series ended in the same professional style it started and ran with !!"
3,Ok DVD,I was really excited to get this movie. It was the ending to the Stargate SG1 story and wanted to see what the would do with it. I think the movie was good but I was expecting a lot more. The epic battles were epic to the point and tune of 30 seconds. I would say get this DVD if your a fan of SG1 and want to see how their story ends. If you don't like the series then this movie isn't for you.
5,Stargate SG-1 - Fans be Ready,"I along with most of the Stargate fans out there think this show should have never been canceled. I watched this series from the beginning start out small and eventually grow to have a cult following that can almost go head to head with any Trek fan. I have not seen the full length movie yet only clips that have become available since the series ended; however the storyline is supposed to answer questions that were left opened when the series ended. I hope everyone out there who is a Stargate fan will purchase this movie and leave reviews to show MGM and Sci-Fi that the Gates brand deserves another chance and ECW does not belong on the Sci-Fi channel. I know there is still Stargate Atlantis and I am a HUGE fan of that show, but it still will never be the same as SG-1. Enjoy everyone."
3,Poor Transfer Quality,"I think the production of the movie was quite good and I enjoyed it as a fan of the series and for the story.However, the dvd tranfer is horrible.The transfer is so noisy and full of mpeg artifacting that it becomes visibly distracting and really takes away from the story. It is also the only DVD title I own that will not play on the PS3 (I used my regular DVD player to play it). They should have done a better job of mastering this DVD but it was clearly not a priority and unfortunately the production suffers from the poor quality."
1,disapointed,"So far I have returned 2 DVD's due to corrupt sectors. The quality is extremely poor and the script could have been written by a fifth grader. The movie continues in the same mundane direction that caused the series to fail. I was really looking forward to the movie but am totaly disapointed.The original Stargate movie was great. The series SG-1 was great up to sometime in season 7. And, YES, I do have all 10 seasons of SG-1 along with all seasons of Atlantis! If I coulld have entered no stars, I would have.Rent the movie first and if you like it, then buy it."
3,"It's OK, But Somewhat Cheesy","--Spoiler Alert--This movie was enjoyable to watch, however I found some of the aspects of the story line somewhat cheesy. Bringing back the replicators might have been OK if it wasn't for the cheesy replicator-infected guy who seemed more like a bad ripoff of the Terminator than anything related to Stargate SG-1.I have to admit that I considered giving the movie 2 stars, but after thinking about it for a few minutes I decided that the rest of the movie was good enough that it didn't deserve that low of a rating."
5,A must see for Sci-Fi/SG1 watchers!,A great action movie that uses all of the SG1 cast throughout the don't blink moving action! An must for your library!
4,Excellent!,A great addition to the Stargate universe. This gives an end to an on-going storyline without sacrificing the story. It's good to see all the same characters fight the good fight. I really enjoy this movie.
3,Good but not great!,"I enjoyed Continuum much more. Maybe because it gives closure to the series. But, if you have enjoyed Stargate SG-1 all these years, you will enjoy this DVD then."
5,"Yeah , we need more like this, & with Jack too",I tried to hold off buying this as I wanted the full screen edition. And even after I got it I wait a week before I watched it. I am glad I did not wait any longer. It was what we expect from Stargate.
5,Stargate Ark of Truth,"Absolutely amazing!!! This wraps up the major storyline and was thoroughly entertaining. If you were even remotely interested in the television series and you are familiar with the storyline in the final season, this is a no-brainer must buy. Unfortunately it leaves a lot of questions that were unaddressed over the years still hanging. Maybe the next direct to DVD movie will close some of those holes or hopefully they will continue with even more in the future. That would be nice."
5,Ark of Truth Sic em SG1,"If you are a Stargate SG1 Fan (which I am). This movie is really really great! It was great to have the gang back together again. If you can't tell I LOVED IT. I hope the next one Continnum is just as good. I hope that these movies will stay on the Best Seller list for at least 52 weeks and they make MGM $50,000,000.00 each, so they can line up about 16 more movies and or find a way to keep the movies coming, and some way to return to TV."
4,Ark of Truth,"This is a good video. For SG1 fans, it will be most enjoyable. In fact the way it was produced/edited is more like a feature film. The difference is subtle but it is there. Possibly it's to make the video more appealing to those unfamiliar with series as well. But this just my hunch. I'm not a movie expert.If your an SG1 fan or just a sci-fi fan, it's worth the purchase price.Bill SwingleJanesville, CA"
4,The Art of Truth,"I love this video, I can't get enough of Stargate. I hope they continue to make more direct to DVD movies."
5,stargate ark of truth,"saw this on tv thought it ended the sg1 series fairly well . the only dissapointment was the scenes with the replicators. i thought it wasnt neccessary to include them into the movie after all this was supposed to put an end to the ori story. anyway, id recommend this movie if you are a stargate fan . i also thought more could have been added to the storyline regarding the ori but all in all its not a bad story"
3,The Ark of Truth,"* SpoilersBeing a very big fan of the series, I must say that this was somewhat of a disappointment. There was enough in this 102 minute movie to expand into at least one season. Another annoying thing about the movie is that the Replicators, which I consider to be the best enemy in all of Stargate Sg-1, was introduced and are defeated in the same movie? If they wanted to bring the Replicators back, they should have had a seperate movie for the Replicators. The Replicators also made it so that the only people actually helping at all at finding the Ark of Truth are Daniel, Vala, and Tealc. Sam and Cam are busy fighting the Replicators and don't contribute that much to the Ori ending. It was good, but I had seen several season finales that were much better than this movie."
2,Further from objective reality,"Stargate SG-1 the next generation...I read somewhere that those people who create psychotic fantasy worldsget further and further from the here and now asthey get more involved in the psychosis.True science fiction is about making predictions about the futurethat may prevent technology from overpowering humanity.Star Trek the nth generation and SG-1 by moving into religionand other galaxies and further from actual hard science have become 'fantasy' like dungeons and dragons with science that ismore in the realm of 'magic' than reality.It was a pretty adventure, but we feel they are never really indanger as 'good' always prevails in this sort of 'B'sci fi series."
2,Yawn,"Not a very creative story line... lots of repeats of themes from the tv show... not very creative dialogue... visually ok, effects and stuff, but predictable finish to story arc, I figured it out in first 20 minutes... blah de blah blahh..."
5,Stargate,"For Stargate fans this is a good DVD. It did provide a venue for expanding on the TV series in a movie format yet continuing on with the concluding story line to an open ended ending. For Science Fiction, excellent DVDs are limited. This is one of those excellent ones. I hope more will follow."
5,A Great Ending,"As a fan of ""Stargate SG1"" and the original movie ""Stargate"" I've been watching the TV show since its inception. As a result and seeing no end in sight of the ORI I just had to purchase this and find out how or if they were finally defeated. Of course they are defeated but had I stuck to only TV to find out what happened - it wouldn't have. All the characters were as usual and wonderful and although I felt this might be predictable... it wasn't. A perfect ending for the ORI - as it should be."
4,Stargate-The Ark of Truth,Since we didnt get a 11th season to finish the Ori storyline at least we got a great movie with lots of special effects to wrap it up. I liked how they ended it but I felt it was rushed through. Still over all a great DVD.
5,Makes me miss the show even more,"Best. Show. Ever. (Well, except for Buffy.) I hope they continue on with tons of movies. I really liked that format. I need more RDA, though. ;)"
2,High hopes but a big letdown,"I had really high hopes for this movie, but it seems that the steady slope of quality stories an acting found in the last two seasons of the series continues here. The actors used to take the plotlines and scripts seriously but now it seems that they've opted for ""campiness"". A lot of the plot doesn't make sense.SPOILER ALERT: It seems that the weapon sent to the Ori galaxy at the end of seson 10 worked, the Ori are all dead already but they've channeled all their power into Adriel. The Ark, that is supposed to have been missing for upteen thousands of years is rediculously easy to find and decipher. Let's not forget a gratuitous replicator subplot that seems to have been put in just to take up time.There's another bad guy that is just so textbook you could tell what he's going to do a mile off. I'm looking forward to the next movie as it's a ""stand alone"" plot but this one got shelved after the first viewing."
2,The ARK a 90 minute mediocre episode!,"After a year of waiting, a very disappointing 90-minute episode entitled ARK OF TRUTH is released with a $20 price tag.I had expected the entire story to be devoted to the end of the Ori, but you will find only half the movie covering their final demise. The other half resurrects an old villian from Stargate's past. So what we end up with is a quick conclusion to the Ori storyline which ends exactly the same way as the Anubus storyline ended. The rest of the movie has battle scenes we've seen before in many past episodes as they fight the old villian from their past. And we also get a fight scene with Cameron against an unbeatable foe very similar to the Black Knight he fought in the Camelot episode. Rent it before buying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not very good.,"This was pretty much like a normal bad SG1 episode from season 10. It is not loaded with special effects nor is the acting anything worth ranting about. The clip you see on Amazon with Tealc is about the best acting scene in the whole movie (Hence why its on Amazon).The overall story is completely rushed, you get the feeling that the producers where saying (We have 2 hours to wrap up the Ori story so Move it!) Overal I have seen many SG1 season enders that where better than this movie so that pretty much sums it up the quality.Ben Browder and Claudia once again just dominated the show with there prescence while once again giving lack luster performances that nobody will ever care about. Save your money and wait for this to come on TV. It was truly a disapointing boring story even for die hard SG1 Fans like me, one of the first times I ever watched a SG1 episode and kept looking at my watch hoping the 2 hours was up."
1,I love all the stargates,To bad the movie on blueray is to grainey. I like the movie but there is so much grain in it that a standerd dvd looks much better.
5,10 yrs was better than 8,"I agree with the reviewer who said this area was to review ""The Ark of Truth"". As for the rest of you, the show was scheduled to end at season eight when Richard Dean Anderson was leaving the show. Fan support by write ins kept it on for 2 more seasons. How many of you wrote to Sci-Fi and/or Stargate producers & writers trying to keep it on longer than 10 yrs? With the demise of SG1, Atlantis script writing has improved. I would suggest you enjoy and support Atlantis so it doesn't go the way of SG1."
4,Good but Utilitarian,"I've watched every episode of Stargate. I even paid for Showtime just so I could see it, before it gated over to Sci-Fi. I very much hated the last episode for reasons I won't go into here. This should give my review a context.Ark of Truth was good. Not great. I really like the actors and the characters they portray. The effects were up there and the interesting Ori story arc was closed nicely. HOWEVER, there was nothing new here. It was an extended episode. What was worse was the whole plot thread that seemed to be added by a fan of the Terminator. It was cheap and a waste. I can only guess their reasons for it but it was insulting to have to watch that to get to the real story.The ending hints at more adventures to come and I'm glad for that. Maybe they can take the Ark over to the Pegasus galaxy..."
2,Boring,I am a sci fi fan but for some reason this video just did not hold my interest. I could not get involved with the characters or plot.
4,Nice DVD at a good price.,Could not wait to check this out. Movie is good and the price was about average. Arrived in no time and was in perfect condition. Good movie for all Stargate fans.
4,You have to love Stargate!,"For Stargate fans, of which I am one, this is a must-have for your DVD collection. It would probably not be of interest to anyone who hasn't watched the entire series."
5,"Closure on the ori - sort of, but fun none the less",Nice to see the television show move on beyond the series. I hope there are many more DVD like this from the stargate crew. So many gates so little time... :-) Happy for a bit of closure on the ori arc.
3,"Well done, but not as special as it could have been.","SPOILERS. This story wraps up the Ori story line much like how they did Goa'uld one, so it isn't that clever, but it is fun and well done. Similar to Continuum and the show in general, the Stargate stories end in the destruction of all of the bad guys. It would be good to see something a bit different. I give it 3 stars because it is worth the money I think, but it could be better or have done more."
4,Final flojo,"Se esperaba más en cuanto a la parte final de la confrontasión con los ORI, el uso de los replicadores de nueva cuenta le reduce puntos a la historia, es una película que la clasificaría como buena, tiene sus detalles."
2,Sad review,Was not satifying it seemed like was compled in a week not like Serenity which completed the story but left you wanting more
5,Mini Season 11 is a Pleaser!,"This two-hour conclusion of the Ori storyline (which would have been drawn out into Season 11 had the show not been canceled) was well-written, well-developed and well-done! While all Stargate fans would have preferred an actual Season 11, at least we can now rest easy knowing how the Ori threat was ultimately handled. While the cast was quickly broken into separate groups, the movie wasn't at all choppy and moved well between the different storylines. A must-have for all Stargate SG-1 fans."
4,Long Live Stargate!,"For Stargate fans, this movie wraps up the loose ends we were left with when the series came to an untimely end! Thanks, Stargate, for keeping true to the characters - can't wait for the next installment!"
5,Stargate-The Ark of Truth,I thought it was very good. Like all good fans I was anxious to see the outcome of the Ori saga.
3,"Love SG1, Ark of Truth wanting.","Not as well written as the series. Seems the writers were too interested in wrapping things up and rushed through the story line. Certain scenes, though breath taking, where too long and seemed to be edited that way just to kill time."
2,Again another Replicator episode!,I was disappointed! I bought this movie and expected an epic conclusion to the Ori Storyline. However I was subjected to yet another replicator episode. It was not what we the fans were promised to get from this movie. I however have high hopes for Stargate Continuum.
5,What a grouch!,"I am sure Oscar would not like it that I think this puppet is so soft and cute. I would have to say he is as good as it gets (for a grouch). Oscar's trash can is shiny and looks like a metal can, yet it is soft. Let the kids get out their grouchiness with this puppet and before you know it everyone will be laughing."
1,This is madness!,"While it's true that the noise level of a phone line can adversely affect the data rate you get over a modem, here are a few things to bear in mind:1) The low-quality part of the line is probably not in your house! It's somewhere between you and your CO (outside).2) You won't get garbled text or munged data from line noise on your phone line. The modem is error-correcting, and the data will be retransmitted. Line noise will cost you speed, not quality (as the manufacturer's review suggests).3) A reiteration of point (1): a line is only as good as its weakest link. Putting gold contacts on the clean part of the line won't help.But hey, they come in swank designer colors."
2,Pretty but...,The glass dragon was broken in several pieces when I received it. My husband was able to glue it together. Nice colors
4,You get what you pay for,"These will probably not be your everyday paddles; they're heavier than the better paddles. But there will be times when you're glad to have some paddles that you can pack up for the smaller car or for the plane ride. They work fine and move the kayak about as well as your standard paddles. For long paddling trips you may prefer a lighter set. They are also ideal for the expedition when you want a backup paddle stowed in the boat. If you're a long way from home, you want a backup paddle that actually works and is rugged, unlike the little cheap single paddles with the telescope handle that some kayakers stow away for a backup. If you need an affordable, reliable, foldable paddle, this one will do a good job."
2,"Too much glitz, not enough information","I would recommend skipping out on this book. If you're really looking for information about JLo's life, this isn't the place to find it. It's more concerned with fashion and the mythos of the ""Jenny from the Block"" fan. Whether you love or hate JLo, this book will likely shed no new light on her life."
2,Huh?,"In fact unclear is a better word. I purchased this book as a supliment to ""Server+ Certification Bible by Trevor Kay"" and yikes!!! First I was mildly disturbed by the fact that the author isn't even Server+ certified. Second the questions are as unclear as Charlie Brown's Teacher in The Peanuts. In my opinion most answers had multiple answers (of which I guessed at what I hoped was the right one) or the questions themselves made no sense at all and being A+, & Network+ certified I would hope that I'm not completely clueless. As a matter of fact the only reason I'm writing this is because I wanted to check this books reveiws before I depended on it for my Server+ exam in a weeks time. Well that's my piece. Good Luck to all and stay away from this book...I hope this helps"
3,Not for Novices,"The publisher does not hide the fact that this book is just a batch of sample questions and answers related to the Server+ exam. This book might be useful if you've been in the field and have done a lot of work on servers and you want to test you knowledge. However, it is of little use for novices who are trying to learn material for the Server+ exam. The biggest problem with this book is that the CompTIA Server+ exam objectives are not even present in the book. Also watch out for the Exam Watch notes, a high percentage of them are totally wrong. For example: The Exam Watch note that states that only RAID 1 and RAID 5 are fault tolerant (page 25). In fact, RAID 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all fault tolerant. The book also lacks an index, which makes it difficult to find sample questions on a particular subject."
3,"It was good, but not the best book I've read.","It it was fine, though I've read better books. I tought it needed to be a wee bit more decisive. If I was the author, I would have given it a more realistic ending. These things sought of things don't really end that way."
3,Phrases,"This is the first BP novel I've read. Found it quite entertaining, except for the f--k word which she uses quite frequently, and in my opinion oft times unnecessary. But it keeps you guessing as to who the real killer is.But the word, and phrase that caught my eye, was ""caca"" used in a comment made by Gails mother ""I'll be up to my knees in caca"". Unless you're English the word would be meaningless to you, to myself it brought back memories of many years gone by, used by many parents to children, for going to the toilet.Which brought to mind a question for Ms Parker, where did you pick up that expression, Caca, I'm certain there's nowhere in N.America where they use it.Would love to hear from you, and where you heard it.Sincerely Richard Barlow"
2,Disappointed in format,Did not realize that this was such large type. It destroys the cohesiveness of the poetry and makes reading difficult.
5,"At last, the things we love in life are actually good for us","This fun, easy-to-read book is a breath of fresh air -- especially as the winter weather and workload are looming out my window and on my desk. (Just looking at the cover relieves my stress!) The new research is intriguing and their advice for good health makes intuitive, as well as scientific, sense. I enjoyed the anecdotes, the authors' sense of humor, and their tips and strategies. Now I'm off to take a recommended ""30-second nap""...."
1,Product review,There is a small crack on the shower head holder. Do not know how long it is going to hold. But it is too much trouble to return it.
5,Delicious Authentic Mexican Dishes,"I have always had a flair and good spicy palette for Mexican cuisine, due to my mother's cooking. I didn't expect greatness from this book since it was only about $13 but wow was I wrong! I love the way it's put together and written. Very easy to follow the directions for each recipe. The colorful pictures are also helpful to get a grasp of the finished product. I have only made a few so far (enchilada's suiza, and a couple of salsas). But I cannot WAIT to spoil my man with several others including the corn soup, grilled prawns, and the delicious looking desserts as well! Great book overall I am very impressed and recommend it to anyone who loves to cook fun-to-cook and highly flavorful dishes."
3,a few possibilities,"The book is small, and some of the recipes are uninspired. But there are also some interesting recipes that contain ideas I wouldn't have thought of."
1,C-c-c ... Cronies!,"Mike Dumanis is a nice guy who did a terrible job on this anthology. It should have been called ""Mike Dumanis' Anthology of His Iowa Friends (and a few others he met at AWP)."" The most myopic anthology I've ever seen."
1,vanity project,"A bold attempt to gather new writings and anyone who attempts that is to be lauded, but much more research and careful consideration could have been given to this project. Anyone can plainly see that this list of poets is made of of 85% of the editors' friends. When will an anthology come out that gives us *really* fresh voices, not just a collection of friends? Some standouts include: Ilya K, and Matthea H. BUT--How in the world is not a single hispanic poet recognized? Sadly, the selections seem weak and could only serve as a vanity project. Save your $$ and buy some lit journals instead. THOSE folks are really doing a labor of love."
4,Invicta mens 10 Diver,Nice looking watch. Was a little disappointed in the weight of the band. It is very light compared to the watch piece. It is very nice looking on the wrist. Only 4 stars because the band feels a little flimsy to me.
4,good idea,"i was specticle , i mean skeptibible , worked great. the water thing was wierd but worked beautifully"
2,stick on reading lenses,"The lenses are very thick and must be moistened to stick, can't see clearly through them and was only able to get 1.5, 1.75 has been not available for weeks.....not good, I expected them to be thin and more pliable, don't fit sunglasses. Would not recommend."
3,Not Too Impressed,I am not too impressed with the lenses I bought from you. They took a very long time to dry after applying and even now they are not very clear.
3,"They work, but one doesn't stay on the sunglass lens",One stays on but the other does not. Still helps even though I only have one.
4,bifocal stick on lens,"These work great because you can select the style glasses you want to put them on, I use them on sunglasses. The only problem with them is they are a little large and they get into your line of vision. It's not a good thing to try and trim them down. I would give them 10 stars if they were a little smaller. They are very easy to use."
2,THE LENS FALLS OFF,"This Item does not always stay adhered to glasses, the heat from the sun will cause the lens to fall off, and they do not fit with all lens shapes. I was disappointed."
2,Was it a very bad year?,"This anthology was excellent last year, containing most of the Hugo-nominated short fiction. As a result, our SF discussion group (about a dozen regulars) chose it for our annual anthology selection. There was unanimous disappointment. It contained a variety of stories and some well-known writers, but nothing that many people liked. The most positive response was that one group member liked two of the stories. Opinions went downhill from there....There were even a lot of typos.Maybe it was a bad year."
1,Computer Brain? USE IT! Be sure what a product is before you ship it!,"Boy, it would be nice if I could actually review a CROSSOVER CABLE. I ordered a CROSSOVER CABLE. A ""Belkin 50ft 10/100BT RJ45M/RJ45M Molded Gray Boot Cat5e Crossover Cable (Yellow)"" to be exact. Described here as having snagless boots.What did I get? A 50ft yellow PATCH cable with NO SNAGLESS BOOTS. Please Computer Brain(less), If you're going to have the audacity to charge as much to ship a cable as to sell it, MAKE SURE ITS THE RIGHT &%$*#@% CABLE! A PATCH CABLE DOES ME NO GOOD, AND NOW I GET TO WASTE MY TIME RETURNING THE SHIPMENT AND CHASING DOWN MY REFUND.ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS AS A VENDOR IN MY OPINION. KNOW YOUR PRODUCT!"
3,Not worth the extra cost,I was hoping that these cables would help me keep at least a 28.8k conection but it does not and I still get bumped off the net. I would have to say from my experance and what I have read that your connection speed depends a lot on how good the phone co. wires are and how far you are from the phone co.
2,Too small,"While the board size is fine the net part is too small and only takes one outfit, but it does keep that one outfit off the floor which is a help.Double the size of the net and it would be a good purchase"
1,"A clunker, not worth your time.","For a video passed off as Bloopermania, you would expect the whole tape to be bloopers, right? Wrong! Only a few bloopers, shown from various angles, and the rest were tough shots, again shown ad nauseum. Don't waste your money."
4,Honest and Well Written,"I am a huge fan of the ""Band of Brothers"" mini series. So Ihad to give David Webster's book about his experiences a tryfor no other reason than to see how much it jibed with themini series take on his experiences.I was pleased to see how much of the mini series kept trueto Webster's account of his service, especially during theHolland campaigns.It is a shame he died so young. Webster would have madea real contribution to American literature."
4,"An original, unsensationalized account","For a first hand, unsensationalized account of life in the Band of Brothers, this is it. I've read all of the other Band of Brother personal accounts but skipped this one because someone wrote that it wasn't worth the read. It was in my opinion the best of all of them. Sure, Webster was a goldbrick and committed private, but his descriptions of the battles and his insight into why soldiers act the way they do is priceless. I highly recommend this book."
4,Different view,This author can be a little different on his views of the military and the airborne infantry during world war 2.
3,How he saw it.,"This writer doesn't offer much different or in a distinctive way about the life of an airborne soldier in World War II. He seems to float along with the tide of battle, and the reader can't feel much of what the writer felt. It's probably enough that it adds to the lore we gradually build about that war, however."
3,Parachute infantry,"David Webster the author, has a good narrative style. It was almost like being there with the solders as they fought their way across Europe. I am a World War II history buff and this book was one of the better ones I have read."
5,Well written WW2 paratrooper memoir,"David Kenyon Webster was that rare breed of paratrooper, Harvard educated with a strong literary skill, who had the proper connections to get out of any dangerous assignment during World War 2, but instead joined the 506th Paratroopers and ended up fighting his way across Europe from D Day until the very end, with Easy Company, 506th PIR. (Band of Brothers). His memoir follows his saga from being in England pre D-Day until the day he ships home after earning the 85 points necessary to be sent home. It also includes many letters he wrote to his family and friends that provide a rare insight into the interaction between a trooper and his family during the war.His memoir is easy to read and very will written. A great prospective of a Paratrooper acting as infantry across France, during operation Market Garden, and into Germany to end the war. If you are a World War 2 buff, this is a great read. I bought it on Kindle and throughly enjoyed it."
4,"A ""grunt's"" view of Band of Brothers","This book is an interesting addition to the story of Easy Company as chronicled in Band of Brothers. It is the story of one highly literate enlisted man's view of the war. It lacks the overview of the war in Ambrose's book and is much more cynical. Before reading it, I would recommend first reading Ambrose's Band of Brothers and Winters' Biggest Brother."
2,Trimbrite,"Ordered the product, and was very disappointed. It is ""so"" thin it is like using toilet paper and very cheap looking. Tossed it out and went to a automotive supply place to get some ""Quality"" stuff."
1,VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS,"I never like to be negative about anyone's books, but this is one that I take very seriously. I equate the lesson of taking these beans with the concept that if a child takes happy pills or drugs, everything turns out well and happy. I do NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK and it should be taken off the shelves!"
5,Lost Classic,"Zigger Beans was the MOST read book in our house when my sister and I were kids. We just loved it. The illustrations, the story, the way it sounded read aloud-""John the mouse put on skates. He rolled across the dinner plates..."" This book really stuck with us in spirit and memory, and luckily we still have the one tattered, crayon embelished copy we ruined as children to fight over. I strongly agree with the other reviewers who think this book should be reprinted. It is THE book I was hoping to buy as a gift for so many of my friends and family who have children now-Children who should be imagining a little mouse wearing sandals and zigger, zigger, ziggering beneath the golden moon."
1,Defender Pro 5-in 1 2006,"Because of a defect in the product, it wouldn't install properly.I went to the website and sent a message to the company's product support address. The message was returned as undeliverable because the address did not exist.Something is wrong and currently I would NOT recommend this product."
1,They simply don't work when it comes to Windows XP,"I had these for about 2 months. After Windows XP SP2 the system stops recognizing the device and so appropriate USB drivers are not latched on. Logitech have no clue, their support is the worst I have seen and would not recommend anyone buy this product.Going by Logitech support and knowledge base, they are 3rd rated - so ask yourself would you pay good money for products that don't work out of the gate and support the company support doesn't have a clue.This isn't rocket science - oh, yes I have done rocket science!!"
3,Review,"This book is filled with interesting facts about Jesus and his times. A must have for anyone interested in History and Jewish law. A scholarly book, indeed. The first Christians were Hebrew and had to find their place within the framework of being saved by grace, and not by the law. This book can help readers understand what it were like to be a Hebrew and a Christian during that time in history. I hope Christians of all backgrounds look past the hysteria of those who call everything anti-Semitic, and who make light of the holocaust by calling people who disagree with their point of view a Nazi, and read this book for what it is, a useful tool to understanding history."
3,Flashes of great insight,"This book would be a 1-1/2 star book but for a few flashes of great insight. I bought it because I heard that one chapter made it worth it. While the chapter on Jewish idioms spoken by Jesus is good, most of the information is available with little work on the internet.If you can get this book on sale, it is definitly worth it, but I'm not sure I would pay full price."
1,the other reives say it all,"this is a book of opinions and thoughts, that is not based on historical evidence or scholarly research. the approach takes on an ambiance of academia, but the quality is poor."
3,It all depends...,"If you are a Christian, you might find this book interesting. If you are not a Christian and are looking to learn something, this book might not help you too much. From the Christian perspective, it assumes that you will believe all the author is saying about ""Yeshua"" and the early Christian church, without backing up much of any of it. Not a bad book overall, but I wouldn't rush to buy it."
3,"Good reading, but needs a clean-up","Readers of Yeshua: A Guide to the Real Jesus and the Original Church will be introduced to a lot of new material that they probably haven't seen elsewhere. The author gives great insight to some of the parables, the Pharisees and 1st century Judaism in general. The book has more than the average amount of errors though. Mostly mechanical stuff like references to verses that don't exist, missing or improper words, and etc. All in all, I am glad that I purchased it."
3,Making a case for Pharisees,"There are some gems in this book. I especially liked the way Mr. Moseley brought out the Hebrew idioms of Jesus. I gave this book only three stars, however, because although the cover says, ""Yeshua,"" the text is mostly about the Pharisees. Though this is interesting in and of itself, I bought the book to study Jesus from a Hebrew stand point, not the Pharisees. The book is well documented and it does propose some interesting possibilities."
3,Could be useful,"Dr. Moseley is from the same stream as Marvin Wilson and Brad Young. Hence, much of this book is a regurgitation of material found in Our Father Abraham, by Wilson, and Jesus, Jewish Theologian, by Young. His approach is fairly sketchy, more of an introduction to the subject. He doesn't get into any depth in the issues he addresses. He also makes assupmptions which he doesn't support or justify and arrives at conclusions that appear to be at odds with the people (Jesus and Paul) that he attempts to explain. If you haven't read anything on the Jewish roots of Christianity, this may be a good intro. However, I would recommend Wilson's book instead."
4,Packed with Info. and Insight,"Reads like a text book (even has detail questions at end of each chapter). Very enlightening with regard to the early church and the Hebrew roots of the Christian faith. Without these basics, one could hardly come to accurate conclusions on the meanings of New Testament writings."
2,Lacked clarity and organization,"While there is some decent introductory information in this book, it is poorly organized, poorly written, and the concepts are poorly explained. The chapter organization made no sense, and within the chapters, there was no sustained argument or thought flow. And though the book contains some informational diamonds, they lack clarity and brilliance."
5,Christians: Read this!,This book will give you a look at the New Testament from Hebrew eyes. It is an excellent example of how far off the church of today really is. If you read this you will gain a deep appreciation of what is really was like in the first century church and see that Yeshua and His followers were Jews who lived and loved the Torah. I believe each and every one who thinks themselves to be a Christian should read this. It will give you a deeper love for Yeshua and a clear understanding of His life and followers.
5,Great quality,"If you need to edit video tape or just copy it to a medium such as VHS tape, get this. It is not only easy to use, the quality of your finished product is fabulous. I love it."
4,"Great bag, looks nice","I bought this bag because I thought the messenger style would be easier to carry, and it is. This bag is really neat because it has labeled pockets for just about everything you need in a diaper bag. I also love the ""hot mama"" compartment, I no longer have to take a diaper bag and a purse with me into stores. I gave it 4 stars because the only problem I have had is that I run out of room for things like extra clothes and blankies and burp towels once I put everything in the labeled pockets. This bag, however, is my favorite diaper bag right now. Great bag for the price."
1,Poor quality hardware,"This is a beautiful bag that looks and feels great. I agree with the reviewer that talked about the difficulty of finding things in the bag due to the black interior but, I knew this before I purchased the bag so I'm not letting that affect my scoring.My biggest complaint has to do with the cheap hardware used for the bag. I've owned the bag for 2 months and recently the buckle used to adjust the shoulder strap's length has broken. I should have seen it coming though since it didn't take more than a couple of weeks before the magnetic snap on the front flap fell off. I found the snap and was able to reattach it but, now that the center post of the buckle has broken, I can't use the strap rendering the bag useless."
5,AWESOME DIAPER BAG,"I bought this bag with my second baby, and I love it. I never found a bag i liked with my first child. This bag is so functional but is still very stylish. It is easy to keep organized and has a place for everything. I will never by another diaper bag."
4,For Hot Mammas Only!,I get compliments on this hip diaper bag everywhere I go. It is a good size with three seperate compartments. Buy it. You won't be sorry.
4,"Nice, BIG messenger style bag","My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that the ""faux suede"" exterior looks a little cheap to me. I got over that quickly and love the bag otherwise. I love the magnetic closure front pocket with pouches for a cell phone, keys, etc. I put EVERYTHING from my old purse and diaper bag into this one. Love that there are several sections of the bag for mama & baby. I like the back pocket (on the outside of the bag) that has a small dipaer changing pad in it too. It is a BIG bag though... so if you're used to a small bag, it will be an adjustment.Stephanie- mom to 2.7 yr old son and 5 month old daughter"
4,Cute bag with many nice features,Just received this bag yesterday and I love it! I've been looking for the perfect bag and this is it. I like the adjustable strap that is long enough to fit over my big winter coat. Love the 3 organized pockets even though they could be a little bigger. I carry alot of stuff for my 2 daughters (2 1/2 and 8 months)! This has a place for everything.
4,diaper bag,"GREAT BAG. HAD A SAMSONITE BAG THAT I USED FOR 3 1/2 YEARS THAT I LOVED! I LIKE THAT THE SIPPY CUPS FIT ON THE SIDES AND ALL THE POCKETS. IT SEEMS A LITTLE NARROW OR SOMETHING, HAVE TO PLAY WITH IT TO SEE IF I AM JUST PACKING IT WRONG."
2,Too bulky and big,"I bought this bag in hopes of it becoming my everyday diaper bag, but when I received it I quickly realized there is no possible way I could lug this monster of a bag around on a daily basis. It does have some great organization features to it and it is cute, but it is entirely too large and bulky to carry around as an every day diaper bag."
1,Needed some unbiased editing with a large red pencil!,"This was perhaps one of the worst books that I've attempted to read in a long time. Is the book still around? No, I just threw it in the stove where it will do more good as a heat source than as any kind of literature. The writing as another reviewer stated was extremely amateurish with extremely stilted dialogue. The characters were lifeless and the plotline was very shallow. Changes from one time to another were made haphazardly with little thought to decent transitions. Definitely pass this book up!"
2,Started well but died on the high seas.,"Being a fan of revolution era stories I looked high and low for this book. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. It starts out with promise. A very bubbly young miss comes upon a man being hanged by a mob for treason......and saves him by claiming he's a friend of hers. They get away on her little sloop but they inadvertenly get captured by the English. Lord Hazard, an englishman, does all he can to procure her return to annapolis. But then that ship gets captured by an american ship. I read half of the book and they were still on a ship......no romance even insinuated about....and the male character very distanced from the reader. I decided I didn't much care if they ever got off the ship and abandoned it."
5,Wrong place right time,"The story leaps from the America's to Europe and all amid a brewing war between the British and US in 1812. The story does not have the typical torrid sexual undercurrent of a romance novel, rather the naive heroine slowly comes to realize her love for Lord Hazard through the turmoil of war."
4,Great Adventure!,This is a very thrilling novel. It is not often that I have come across a book set in this time period in this setting - the war of 1812 rather than the English fighting Bonapart. The adventures keep the first half of the book enthralling and even knowing the outcome of the war doesn't diminish the excitement and anticipation as events unfold. There are several fun side characters that you meet along the way and have a way of popping up when you least expect them. I must say that I found Lord Hazard to be a character I couldn't quite connect with. Page was a delightful character whom I could sympathize with and could feel her pain and confusion. I almost cried with her at some points in the story. Good read and I would recommend it.
2,Color,Ivory is not a good color for business cards. We should have gone with white. We put a picture on the cards and white would have made the color of the business stand out more.
2,Included with the actual show - don't bother,"Not wanting to miss a single bit, we watched this before the actual ""Asylum of the Daleks"" show. Little did we know, it was included in the beginning of the show. This would have been no big deal, but I feel like we were ""cheated"" out of our purchase price. Amazon - please make this one free.... or just take it down of the purchase list. My low stars have nothing to do with the content - all to do with the fact that you really don't need to purchase this bit to get the full Dr. Who catalog."
5,A great start!,"Regular viewers and Who fans know that any Doctor Who episode that has the phrase ""I'm very, very, sorry.."" is going to be a heartbreaker, and this is no exception. Yes, the season opener has Daleks, sheer terror, a beautiful mystery woman, strange planets, new characters, alien ships, transporters, moments of real horror, and an important event in the history of the Doctor's relationship with the Daleks that will no doubt resonate in future episodes. This episode has all the the makings of real classic that will be referred back to in future story lines. (If you have a large screen LED TV, opt for the HD streaming. It's worth the extra dollar.)"
4,Dr. Who: Asylum of the Daleks,"New show not firing on all pistons but still an interesting opening episode, especially the nice twist at the end."
4,Not my favorite but still Dr. Who :),"I did not like Dinosaurs on a spaceship or this episode as much as the Asylum of the Daleks and A Town Called Mercy. Those were exceptional! And of course whatever Moffat writes is a thumbs up :) ! I hope as this series progresses that we will see more of the new head of Unit, however, as she is a wonderfully talented actress given the opportunity to display her range of emotive expression. She also did fantastic job in that detective series, Murder In Suburbia. If you've never seen that series it was well done."
4,Awesome,"Great show... when should each episode come out, it has been at least 3 hours and I'm tired of waiting."
1,Paying for commercials is eveil,"This is an ad for the upcoming season. As an ad it does not really work for me since I see nothing new in the up coming season to make me want to pay for the next few episodes. I like the Dr but I am going to wait 6 months for it to show on Netflix. Also, charging me 99cents for three minutes has made me an angry viewer. Only for the new Canadian Primeval would I pay that......rip off!"
2,not worth it.,"I love Doctor Who but there's nothing important that happens in this 3 min video. Don't purchase it, you're not missing anything I swear. -from a fellow Whovian"
1,Dr. Who Prequel,Thought this was a total rip off. a 3 minute video for 99 cents. Of course they don't tell you this prior to paying you find out once you've paid.
5,Wow!,"No spoilers, just make sure you have a box of tissues. Dr. Who keeps me caring intensely for the characters."
2,Did not appreciate this Ep,"I love Dr. Who as a whole. This episode however, was fast and only mildly funny. The dinosaur was the best part. This ep had a lot of unnecessary innuendos in it I did not care for. It may possibly not be suitable for smaller children. There was not a lot of character development but a lot of endangerment which centered around said innuendos."
1,Meek british television. Embarrassed for you,"I now know why England lost an empire. (Spoiler. DW, kill the bad guy at minute 10, not fix his legs....) This episode was an amazing diatribe on running scared and deferring to slightly superior forces. Was this really created from a nation that once ruled most of the globe? I was a huge DW fan, but I am ashamed by this. Seems every television show out of our little island is about girls taking care of scared little men. I give you ten years maximum only because the US is nostalgic."
4,Entertaining start to the season,"My daughter and I are big fans of the new series and since we do not get BBC America, opted to watch it on Amazon. We rented the standard definition version and I was hard pressed to tell the difference.***Spolier Alert*** Who'd have thought that the Daleks would have enlisted teh aid of their most hated enemy only to lose that hatred and all memory of the Doctor.***Very believeable plot line and a good mix of drama and humor as well. Fits the Dr. Who formula perfectly. One of my favorite episodes in the Matt Smith era."
3,Entertaining but lacking,"I've enjoyed this first half season, but it feels like the epic feelings Doctor Who seasons 5 and 6 invoked. It maybe that I'm jaded waiting for the Ponds to leave but I just felt every episode in season 6 and the previous was a grand sweeping adventure."
5,The title says it all,Dinosaurs on a spaceship... It's my favorite of the season so far... A spaceship with dinosaurs get hi jacked .... It's great fun.. Including Rorys dad who is played by the wonderful Mark Williams.
5,Loved it!,"""Anachronistic electricity, keep out signs, aggressive stares. Has somebody been peeking at my Christmas list?"" How awesome is that? I have been a fan of Dr. Who for years and this season is brilliant so far!"
1,Can't watch it,Amazon won't let me play it on my computer. Can only come up with the conspiracy theory that they want me to buy a flat screen TV and a gizmo to watch it with.It works fine when it is allowed.
3,Dr. Who continues,Another 30 minutes of fun and some excitment...good to see Amy and Rory have it out and make-up at the end.
1,Waste of .99 cents that's for sure,"It is merely a trailor and not an actual episode,big waste of .99 cents too. They should list it better so another person does not waste their money or time, or just leave it as free. Not worth any more in my opinion."
1,Do not pay for this!,I bought this with the first episode because I'm silly and din't fully read the description but it is only a 3 minute clip that costs as much as a full hour episode.
2,Over the Top,"I am a true Doctor Who fan and a true science fiction fan, so I am used to a lot of fantasy. But there is a point where it is too much. I only watched the first two episodes. I got tired of watching wildly unbelievable events that occur for no apparent reason. I really miss the thoughtful plots of the older Doctor Who's. Amy Pond is great but she is the only part of Season 7 that I like."
5,One of my favorite tv shows.,I have been watching dr.who since the 1970's . To me it is the best scifi tv show on the tube.
5,WHEN CAN WE GET EPISODES!,"WHEN CAN WE GET EPISODES!WHENS THE FIRST RELEASE DATE? THIS TEASER HAS BEEN OUT FOR A MONTH. NEED MY FIX !!!!!!!(EDIT: UPDATE AFTER THE SEASON ENDED AFTER ONLY 5 EPISODES!)Only 5 episodes the standard for DR. WHO has been 13-15 episodes at least sense they started numbering the seasons, now they leave us with 5! that only a third of the other, whats going on DR."
3,"once loaded, great video quality- takes too long to find the internet signal","once loaded, great video quality- takes too long to find the internet signal (even when you know that your internet signal is strong)."
3,"Season 7.... not up to the ""Who Standard""","In general just did not reach the standard that I have come to expect. The good bye to Amy was poorly done even if they have future fixes. Someone that was here for 3 years deserved a ""Big Bang"" to leave on!! I feel like wrighting more but the dissappointment in me leaves me with nothing left to say."
3,A very good kids' show,"Well done, especially the Mitchell and Webb cyborgs. But I am missing the adult frisson that RiverSong brought to the group. Will the Doctor ever grow up?"
5,Yay for Amazon...,I am unable to get BBC network so was very excited to be able to pre-purchase this. I am a big fan. Even knowing what is to come (Amy and Rory) I eagerly await each email message stating a new episode is in my library. It's such a kick in the pants to see British TV shows recorded here in the USA. Really good to see Ben Browder in this episode. Enjoyable SciFi is hard to find with this level of humor.
4,A fitting send off for the Ponds,"The episode may have lacked some of the emotional impact it might have had, since it was widely known by fans that Amy and Rory were leaving the show. That said, this episode ranks with Steven Moffat's best. He pushed the right emotional buttons and succeeded in leaving us with a touching, bittersweet final chapter for the Girl Who Waited and the love of her life, the Last Centurion."
4,The season could use some work but has a great emotional punch,This season had it's pluses and minuses. The Ponds were given a perfect send off and the new companion is interesting. The Western episode has been done before but it was nice to see a parent accept the time travling and love it as much as the companions do. Can't wait to see what happens next.
1,Dr. Who is amazing. This service is not very good.,"Firstly, the show is brilliant and you should watch it. This service, however, lacks.I've been trying to do things the legal way and not torrent but this service is so frustrating that it's pushing towards a life of crime.It took me more than 30 min and much googling to figure out how to download this episode. The idea is to stream but who wants to watch a show with buffering? Just useless. And the downloading option requires that I download something else first. Then the downloading of the actual episode is pathetically slow.In the future this service may work but for now it just doesn't. What a terrible way to watch a really great show."
5,Awesome show!,"Great show and every season gets better. Have never been disappointed with the newest doctor. Have yet to watch the ""classics"" but the new are wonderful."
5,The side we never get to see..,"I won't ruin it for you in case you haven't got to see it yet, but the doctor does a few interesting and questionable things in this episode. He starts to portray a side of himself that we never get to see too often, but a bada** side of himself never-the-less. Later in the episode as you will see, Amy makes a pretty valid point when she points out his behavior and what isolation from his companions does to him if he is gone for too long."
2,Russell T Davies Come Back!!,"Since Steven Moffat has taken over as head writer, the serious has slowly declined, but this season is ABSOLUTELY horrible! Especially this episode & the Dinosaur episode. The stories have the same rushed feel, & have a repeated formula of pushing his own ""agenda"". We used to be able to watch this show as a family, but this season we have refrained from letting our kids watch some episodes!"
3,"The show is awesome, streaming on XBox is painful","While the episode itself is 5 stars all of the way, I have to temper my review with the reality of streaming video using Amazon's service on the XBox 360. The service is always hit or miss, and, unfortunately, it's been a whole bunch of miss lately. I look forward to the day when Amazon updates the software to allow auto adjusting video quality for when the internet connection dips to less than prime. It works that way when streaming on a computer, just not on the Xbox at this time."
1,"3 minutes, seriously?","Who would pay a dollar for 3 minutes of a public TV series? This is kind of ridiculous, in fact I'm going to have to say-- exterminate!"
1,Do not buy! Waste of money!,"Why in the world would anybody charge a buck to watch a preview? I guess I didn't read carefully, and thought I was getting an actual episode. Oh, no. It was about 30 seconds of montage, and then finis. I'm a big Dr. Who fan, but this particular video is just a prank. Do not buy!"
5,One of the best seasons so far,"I have loved season 7 so far, a fantastic way to say goodbye to Amelia Pond and Rory, and a fun introduction to the new companion."
5,Great as usual,Dr. Who. Enough said!! Anyone into this series will be as excited and nervous as I am to see how the new companion works out. Goodbye to Amy and Rory.. or is it?
3,Loyal Who fan losing interest,"I've digested every episode since Gerald Ford was president. I've even learned to appreciate the high-budget/hot babe New Dr Who over the last several years(though I do miss Mr Baker). While no disrepect to Ms Gillan ( who is painfully beautiful), I'm weary of this Amy/Rory soap opera. Time for a Regeneration!"
3,nice concept but overall not moving,"while i did like this video there is some problems i have with this. the plot took too long to develop over the course of the entire story. some of the actors were miss used and seemed a bit rushed. Matt Smith does a flawless performance as usual, but some of the side characters like mark williams and Jemma Redgrave seemed to have gotten sidelined in this episode. Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill. the Shakri plot only took till the 3rd part to get going. it would have been more interesting for more to develop with the doctor and the ponds if the tardis could not leave, and then the Shakri plot took more precedence. Overall it was an ok episode. it had it's moments but overall it needed more impact and more development with the side characters."
4,Interesting Start for Season 7 Who,"The beginning definitwly caught me off-guard, as I had not watched the filler episodes available online. That said, this is an interesting divergence from what I have come to except with Doctor Who. Some good changes, and some bad. This episode/season might not be the best for all DW lovers but it should be watched regardless."
3,good...good...good...swoosh!,"It started off good, insights into Amy & Rory and a little of the Doctor. Then the monster swept in and was gone with barely a howdy do. If the cubes could have been more dangerous longer, it would have been best as a two parter."
4,What is up with that $.95 trailer?,"Is there any reason that to buy a TV pass for season 7, I have to pay for every single episode already on Amazon, INCLUDING that little 2.5 minute trailer that is also a part of the ACTUAL episode one that I have to pay $.95 for?Otherwise, great series, as a college student without TiVo, this is so much easier than trying to catch every episode as it comes, not to mention I'm a bit late to the whole show and JUST finished season 6 on Netflix, and was NOT looking forward to having to scour the internet for seedy websites that would let me watch the beginning of season 7."
3,As trailers go...,"This is demonstration that in some ways, Amazon has nothing but chips for brains. This is nothing more than a season trailer. It was never intended to earn a rating."
5,great for Dr Who fans,"We love them all, the only down side is they did not release the whole season (not an amazon problem). If you are a Dr. WHo fan you will not be disappointed."
5,Who doesn't love Dr. Who?,"Excellent, as with all Dr. Who!! Again, what more can I say, I will continue to write until my quota of words are met."
2,Serious retconning needed,"Much as I know that the two actors are moving on, it could have been done in a better episode. Cheers for the strength of the various marriages in the Eleventh Doctor's life being key, but we really could use more elegant work here."
2,One of the worst,"Very disappointing. What, yet another poorly written dalek episode.The Dalek story is too over used. It was so boring and predictable I felt I wasted $2.00."
2,Great episode mediocre quailty,"I had hoped to avid the long buffering times and low video quality of illegally uploaded episodes of Dr. Who on amazon. Sadly this video was watchable but no where near worth the price I paid to watch it. Only slightly more reliable then your average video site and with a price tag. Just to make it clear my computer runs videos on Netflix and youtube wonderfully, it even plays most video games online with no lag, thus it seems that the video streaming program was the problem. I going to stick with google and perseverance from here on for my whovian fix."
3,"dorky fun, but kind of...meh","this episode was kind of a spectacular premise, but a let down as far as dw goes. the ending was super cheesy, after a big mysterious build up. no spoilers, but maybe don't expect much."
2,Dull and Uninspired,"This episode was the worst Doctor Who episode since ""The Beast Below"" and ""Victory of the Daleks."" I found myself wanting to turn it off about half way through. The episode completely betray the Doctor's Kantian philosophy on morality. It was cliche, predictable, and uninspired. If the rest of this season's episodes are like this, Doctor Who won't be around for much longer."
