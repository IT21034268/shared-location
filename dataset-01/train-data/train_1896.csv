3,Not his best work,Not in the same league as Eye of the Needle. You better read about the characters before you order. Not my cup of tea.
3,"Jackdaws, the story","I ordered the book, Jackdaws by Ken Follett, for my Kindle as my book club had chosen it for its next read. I have enjoyed several of Follett's books and looked forward to Jackdaws. I hate to say I was a bit disappointed, but it was very perdictable. A little more intrigue and a less superhuman heroine perhaps? In a horrible and dangerous time, World War II when France was occupied by Germans preparing for a major battle with the Allies, the heroine never faultered. Realistic? Not really."
2,The Dirty Dozen meets The Steel Magnolias,"Not Ken Follet's best effort. This book is basically a feminine reincarnation of The Dirty Dozen updated for political correctness. It's a triple dip: strong woman versus evil man, politicians who are bigots and liars, and the drag queen with inner strength and beauty. Then, throw in some romantic tension...boy and girl, that girl and her husband, her husband and another girl, girl and girl, and the Nazi and the sweet hooker. There are enough gays, lesbians and affairs in this book to keep Jerry Springer in material for a month. I'm a Ken Follet fan but this one just doesn't measure up. I felt as though the author was being condescending."
1,Yuck! I want my money back!,"I waited for this book to come out in paperback because I thought the concept of a gang of female operatives in WWII would be interesting, and the single star I gave this novel is only for Follett's concept. Everything else in the book is predictable, boring or downright dumb.I haven't read any of Follet's other novels, so I don't know if he has a habbit of creating the weak caricatures similar to those in Jackdaws or if he simply has a problem writing female chracters, but nothing about any of the characters --male or female -- rang true. At one point I had a strong image of Mr. Burns and Smithers from The Simpsons in my mind while reading about the Nazi spy-hunter and his assistant.The romance that protagonist Flick finds herself in is downright gratuitous and unnecessary to the plot and all of the dialogue was just weak...."
2,Not Interesting,"Ken Follet is usually a great writer. Not this time. His strength is strong interesting characters that you come to care about. Not this time. The first half of the book is mostly page-filler. The second half, the action half, has a weak plot that he supplements with detail about torture.If you want a great Follet read on WW II, try The Key to Rebecca or other earlier works."
2,"Oh, please!","This is one of the silliest, most implausible books I've ever read. I certainly expected more from Follett, who has written some real winners. Commanding officers referring to a group of spies as ""girls"", the main character making ridiculously emotional choices while she's in command of a supposedly vital, world changing operation -- well, that's how it goes, through the whole book. Dumb, dumb, dumb. We know he's capable of better writing. This is a rip off."
2,"yawn, but hurah for the female heroine","yawn, for me this book never took off...i kept waiting for the sparks to fly with the male lead and the female lead....not..i really like ken follet but his last few books were letdowns. its like the story is there, and you are waiting to get to that next level with the character but it never comes. flat. its too bad because the story had a lot of potential, a great female lead and a good setting but he does nothing with it. sorry ken!"
2,"Not bad, but nothing great","1. I've heard a lot of good things about Ken Follett and was looking forward to this book.2. Bottomline: it's not a bad book, but nothing significant beyond an average ""ok"" book. Translation: I don't feel any need or inspiration to get another Ken Follett book."
3,Not very thrilling,"In the field of World War II historical novels, this is strictlya commercial entry. I turned the pages, but I also felt Follettsearching to keep interest up (like with a female impersonator).And as is too typical in the commercial fiction realm, these Nazisare not very scary. Question for Mr. Follett: why do your Nazisnever have opinions about Jews, or Hitler, or anything else? Nomatter, they only exist to add plot obstacles. This novel is fullof activity, but not so much excitement.Steve Wiggins, author of ""Streets of Warsaw""Streets of Warsaw: A Novel of the Polish Resistance in World War II"
5,Awesome,"i bought this book not really knowing what it was about, but once i started reading it i couldn't put it aside, I give it a 5 out of 5. i think anyone who loves a good book should definitly read this one, it was great. It's a great mixture of love, war and friendship. Ken Follet is a very good writer and has great style."
5,A Feat--and a Feast,"Ken Follet achieves the nearly impossible task of creating genuine suspense about an event that is well-known, using fresh characters, clever plotting, and surprising twists on an old story. You will enjoy this book on a long plane flight, or just sitting out on your porch during the lazy days of summer. I always enjoy Ken Follet's approach to history--crackerjack pacing, strong dialogue, and a deep desire to entertain. If only all writers cared as much about their audience's enjoyment as Follet does, TV would become obsolete.Donald Gallinger is the author of The Master Planets"
5,"Best Follett effort since ""Pillars of the Earth""","A book more in the vein of ""Eye of the Needle"" than his more light-weight recent efforts, this book is a major event for us Follett fans. It is a real page-turner, with the usual Follett detail that we have come to expect. A real winner. ""Eye"" is my favorite Follett spy/intrigue work, with ""Pillars of the Earth"" being, in my opinion, a very under-rated effort. This book doesn't approach the majesty of ""Pillars"", but it is definitely in Follett's top five or six."
4,A Riveting WWII Thriller!,"While his last several books were mediocre at best, Follett returns to classic form with Jackdaws. Though not as good as Eye Of The Needle or The Key To Rebecca, Jackdaws is Follett's best book in many years. The tension constantly builds and the action is non-stop. For pure suspense-reading, Jackdaws will have you biting your nails and on the edge of your seat. However, Jackdaws falls short of deserving a 5-star rating from me because, with the exception of Flick and Dieter Franck, many of his characters served as ""tools"" to tell this action-packed WWII thriller and were not developed well enough to truly care (one way or the other) about. While I thought this criticism would be important for you to know, I would highly recommend Jackdaws if you're in the mood for a novel of suspense set in the most dangerous days of WWII."
3,Typical Early Follett,"The author has a tendency, wishfully, to ascribe male inner and physical feelings to his female characters. It is OK. It isn't a top ten hit."
3,Jackdaws,"Good book, it keep my interest. I belong to a book club and this was one of the books that was on the list."
2,"Good premise, bad delivery","This was a great idea for a book. However, I thought it would be about WWII and spies, but for the most part it was about homosexuality and promiscuity. It seemed that Mr. Follet cared more about sexual details than he did about telling a story about the SOE behind enemy lines in France. I also thought that Homosexuals were still a minority in todays world, let alone 1945. But 3 out of the 6 women in Mr. Follets book were gay. Great premise Mr. Follet, bad delivery. This is one reader who will not be coming back."
2,Totally predictable.,Not nearly the quality of his prior works. No complexity of characters is attemted. The storyline is predictable within the first several chapters. Don't bother.
1,WW II and the gays.,"Halfway through the book and encountered the fourth gay/lesbian. Didn't feel like reading further. Other than these encounters, seemed to hold my interest."
1,NOT A TYPICAL KEN F. BOOK,THE ONLY THING GOOD ABOUT THIS BOOK IS IF YOU'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH YOUR WIFE AND SOMEBODY STEALS HER PURSE YOU CAN THROW IT AT THEM.
1,Something Charles Busch might adapt.,"I was so looking forward to this story. All the reviews above were so good and the story seemed compelling. Even the first chapter was invigorating. But then everything bogged down into soap opera and very one-dimensional characters, mainly in that of its heroine Flick. I wouldn't let this woman drive me to the grocery store, much less lead me into battle with the Nazis in France. Follett has a great disregard for women, as can be seen in each and every female character in this book and in ""Pillars of the Earth"" and ""The Eye of the Needle."" His most fleshed out characters are the Nazis, which is frightening in itself.The reference to Charles Busch in my title is that he would play Flick to the hilt and at least get some humorous value at this tasteless story."
5,A WWII story about women heroes,I had never read Follett before and was pleasantly surprised at this book. Wonderful story about a group of British women agents who worked with the French Resistance during WWII. It's nice to read a WWII story based on just some a few of those real women who risked their lives to turn the tide of the war for France. A great quick read with characters you want to hear more about after you've finished.
5,Page turner.,"I found this book to be a fast paced page turner that was as intriguing as it was exciting.The book opens with a failed attempt at gaining control of a Nazi communications bunker in France by a group of resistance fighters. Some of the group is killed, but the heart of the group manages to escape with their lives. Felicity, the main character, must go back to England to regroup, leaving her husband, Michael, in France to fend for himself.Felicity works with the British government to put together a rag-tag group of women who will take the bunker, therefore, severing an arm of Nazi communication. All the while, the Nazi's are actively hunting for the leaders of the resistance group to snuff out the next attempt.This novel is full of action, espionage, excitement sprinkled with a little bit of sex."
4,A page-turner with a few reservations,"""Jackdaws"" is cohesive and generally well-written. My only complaint is Mr. Follett's frequent harping about how tiny Flick is. What is it with this annoying obsession some writers have with doll-size women? Can't you just see a female who is barely five feet tall attempting to put a knife through the eye of a tall muscular male? In reality he would be able to swat her like a mosquito. I had to mentally ""grow"" Flick so that her stature would match her escapades, therefore giving the whole thing some credibility."
5,Tough to put this book down,"Am trying to learn as much as I can about WWII and need to research this book to find out how much of the background is accurate realizing that this is a book of fiction. I would agree with another reviewer who found some inaccuracies and some inconsistencies with the time period in which this story takes place but having said that the book was nearly impossible to put down. Interesting premise, well constructed plot, and good character development. Follet gave me a sense of what occupied France must have been like and under what terror the French had to live. Perhaps I am not a professional reviewer but this book worked for me as a gripping piece of historical fiction.Would definitely recommend it to a friend along with Eye of the Needle.Update: If I am not mistaken BBC has made this into a mini-series that is quite good."
4,"Review ""Jackdaws""","Excellent story, very realistic based on what I have gleaned from ""true life"" stories from the people who fought the Nazis from behind the lines. I am an avid follower of Mr. Follett. I particularly like his leap from mystery to near true stories about Europe in the middle ages etc."
2,A singular miss,"While I am a big fan of Follett, this was not his finest effort. The story could have been compelling, but the prose was not up to his standard."
4,good read like all of Follett's books.,I liked this book. Follett is excellent at developing his characters and making you care about what happens to them.
2,"Review of Purchased Book, Jackdaws (Large Print)",I would have preferred a soft back with Large Print. I tear out the pages to read. As the hard back book is too heavy.
4,What a great book!,"Although it is not the best one I read by FOllett, I must give 4.5 stars. Some reviewers say that you know from the start what the ending is like, i must disagree. You may know from the beginning what the mission is going to be, but you will certainly be surprised by the twists in the story, and you will not go to sleep until you finish it."
3,Charlie's Angels meets the Dirty Dozen,"...got the audio book from Blockbuster to pass the time during a road trip with the family.Overview:Female Allied spies on a sabotage mission behind enemy lines in France just prior to D-Day. Based on a true story.Opinion:Decent plot, really paints a good picture of the brutal realities of occupied France during WWII and covert ops.Lacked deep character development and the complexity of better novels in this genre. Good big screen movie candidate (which normally means bad book)Not in the league of classic Ludlum, Clancy, etc.I liked Follett's ""The Third Twin"", this one was a bit of a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"I really looked forward to getting this book. I waited till my library had the unabridged audiobook and listened to it as soon as I checked it out. What a disappointment. I've enjoyed a lot of Follett's novels but not this one, I think because I didn't like any of the main characters. The shallow romance and detailed torture scenes weren't enjoyable for me at all. I enjoyed the descriptions of the Jackdaws but guess what happened to most of them. I guess I don't really enjoy reading such stark reality--I get enough of that on the news."
1,Movie rights anyone?,"A predictable thriller the purpose of which seems to be to sell the movie rights. You can just SEE the special effects. Oh yes, plenty of gratuitous sex at regular intervals to broaden the appeal and assure an R rating. I'm not a frequent reader of this genre, but the plot borrows wholesale (with no apparent attempt to repay the debt) from ""The 7 Samurai"". Can't hold a candle to ""Eye of the Needle""."
5,Truly a book you can't set down..,"This was a great book, I enjoyed it a lot, there are some books I can read in the train, and just continue it day after day, and there are books like these, where I just have to finish it, and once I do, just wish there was more.. Very interesting, described vivid images.. loved it.."
3,"Dont read Jackdaws, Eye of the Needle, Hornet Flight in same year","I just wanted to emphasize what another reviewer said. I used to read all the Follet back in the day of Pillars. However, i actually have a paranoid belief that he does not write all of his books. Sure Pillars and Needle are incredible, but it is hard to believe the same guy is writing this and Pillars and World Without End. i have had this feeling on other Follet books. that is why i quit reading him circa Dangerous Fortune. This triangle of WWII books is like they took Needle and told a staff guy to go and write two more like it. Anyway it remains a decent read but nothing like his two Novels."
4,"A great thriller, start reading it on a Friday...","...because you won't want to put it down until you are done. Follett's Jackdaws is an exciting read from the first page to the last. Sure, some of it may be implausible, but it's a thrilling ride. Follett builds suspense by trading viewpoints between the Nazi, Dieter, in charge of finding the British spies in France; and with Flick, the lovely British spy who has led numerous groups of French resistance for years. Flick's challenge is enormous: in a day she needs to find a team of women in Britain who can speak French fluently, and possess the qualities she needs to blow up a telephone exchange. It's almost like ""The Dirty Dozen"" but with a female cast. Dieter is one of the greatest villains I've ever read about, unfortunately his atrocities are based in fact. Dieter pulls out all the stops to capture Flick and her group of spies. If you like WW2 stories and espionage thrillers, don't miss this one."
4,Classic Follet -- 4 1/2 stars,"Jackdaws is clearly the best of Follet's recent books. The story is set in the UK and France during the period just prior to D-Day in WWII. The Germans are in the middle of preparations for the massive Allied invasion that they know is inevitable. The French resistance, supported by the Allies, is doing what it can to be disruptive in advance of the attack. In the middle of it all is a group of British secret agents who are tasked with destroying a key communications exchange in northern France. When the first plot is foiled, a more desperate plan based on an all-female attack team is launched. Jackdaws is an impressive tale of espionage, with intense physical, emotional and intellectual battle being done among the combatants. It is full of intrigue, twists, turns and surprises that are classic Follet. The reader is presented with interesting characters and an entertaining, fast-paced story. Jackdaws will be difficult to put down once you get started."
2,Don't buy this book,"This book is the least helpful OB text I've ever read. It is limited on info, silent on treatments, and out-of-date. Lots of good drawings, but save your cash, and your time."
5,"Great Book, very useful for quick overview","Great Book, very useful for quick overview. Will be found exceptionally useful by visual learners. Clear, concise explanations and very good drawings."
3,"Insight, but not info on how to or any scenes!","I like this, but you really have to understand that it is emails written between a sub & her master. It does NOT go into detail about a scene or anything that is really done. It just goes on to say later ""Oh, I really likes serving you yesterday"" & ""Wow, you sure gave me a thorough session etc. etc.) It DID make me reflect on my own life however. I found similarites & came to answers in my own situation. -Interesting."
1,Begging for Narrative,"Usually I give a book the first 100 pages to decide if I want to continue reading. I made it to page 56 with this one and couldn't go any further. I wanted so much to enjoy reading this and at the outset I thought I was in for a good read. There's nothing more boring than leaving the readers out of the action. This book is all self-reflection, which is great if you happen to find your teenage daughter's secret diary, but I wanted a narrative--a real story. The reader is never taken inside a scene, but only reads about reflections, and the book goes to more than 372 pages like this! The emails used to tell Puppy and Master's story should have been converted into a well developed narrative. I guess the author didn't have the talent to do that."
5,A Great Read,"Trinity features old Lord Anselm of Hrak Tra, who longed for one last adventure before he left this earth. Little did he know his wish would come true when he meets two younger versions of himself at a crossroad one misty night. The story line is very imaginative and cleverly written. It's sprinkled with mystery, romance, mystical powers and a deadly curse. I enjoyed it immensely..."
1,Never Read It,"I read quite a bit, and really like books about Wall Street and the insiders game there. I can't remember ever starting a novel and just not being able to finish it. This book is boring. The characters are flat, and the sexual; references are just not exiciting. The plot: completely predictable. I've never written a review here but I felt compelled to save a few people some money. To borrow from an old Monty Python joke:This is not a novel for reading ... this is a novel for lying down and avoiding."
1,What kind of an ending was that!,"I kept reading this book, thinking that there was going to be some point to it, but most of the characters and the story was left hanging. I was very dissapointed. I kept thinking I must have missed a page and lost the character there. Unless there is a sequil to this book, I wouldn't waiste my time reading it."
1,No Substance,Harold Robbins novels once seemed so deliciously erotic; now they just seem lame and smutty. This book was a BIG disappointment. I read about half the book and lost interest with the rest. I think I will stick with reading literature with more substance and less trash.
1,Never Good is more like it,"I bought this book thinking it would be good. Was I ever sorry. I wish there was a no star or half star rating This had to be the worst piece of fluff ever published. The writing was stilted and childish. The story of David Shea, a totally self absorbed power hungry user would have been better if the writer could write. I can't believe as the preview said that a ""carefully selected"" writer was responsible for this meandering loose story. If you want to read the crisp, tight, really juicy Harold Robbins books, go for his classics. You won't be disappointed."
1,Trash,"In the first place this book is not written by Harold Robbins, but is a compliation of garbage by some unknown writer and Mr. Robbins wife apparently. The plot is juvenile at best, and the sex parts appear to be written some twelve year olds or so that are looking for the crudest, most gutter type of trash. I am confident that Mr. Robbins is spinning in his grave to see his name placed on such garbage.It is unfortunate that you do not have a negative rating available for this as it is sub minimum."
4,Seemingly high quality skillet,"Not much to say about this product. It's as you'd expect. A heavy, seemingly high quality, KitchenAid product. Mine did have some small, almost imperceptable bumps on the cooking surface which I was concerned might eventually come of into my food which would be bad. But it hasn't... yet. Otherwise my only specific comments would be:* It's RED. Could be a decor issue for some folks.* The actual flat cooking surface is much smaller than the overall diameter of the pan. It'd be good for cooking eggs, omlets, etc. but you can't realy fit more than one sandwich in the pan at a time due to the sizable sloped sides."
4,it works great,"Ya know I love the even and non-stick cooking and the ease of cleaning...from what I can tell it deserves an A+ for this alone. I just don't like the flat serface size. On my old 12"" skillet, I could fit 3 pieces of french toast perfectly, but I can only fit 2 on this one. For the price and ease of great cooking it deserves a 5 star. Like I said, it needs a larger flat bottom and less flared sides. Perhaps I will appreciate this more later on."
2,Cisco CID Certification Guide,"I took the exam and did pass it. I was reading this book and was amazed with the errors and the references to graphs and charts that were not in the book. The book goes into a painfull explanation of SNA, which is more confusing then helping the issue. The voice part is readable but that just about it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who want to pass the test. It has too much irrelevant information."
2,"Tons of mistakes, or lack of detail","I recently just started reading this book, and I'm now up to chapter 12 amazingly. I can't believe the lack of detail that went into this book. It VERY VERY often will mention something important, and then not tell you what it is. A perfect example is in the OSPF section it tells you that routers form adjacencies, but doesn't explain what it is or how they are formed! There are also more technical errors in this book then any other book I have ever read. I plan on taking this exam next week . . . perhaps after reviewing several other sources first."
1,Sub-standard and shameful!,"Having passed 6 Cisco exams (na, da, np)I must say this is the poorest excuse for Cisco study material I've yet encountered. That includes Cisco Press, Sybex/Lammle, and NetCerts. Gross conceptual innacuracies (not just typos!) frequently highlight the writers' fundamental misunderstanding of the topics. To think that one of the writers is a CCIE shakes my confidence in the program altogether.I have only read up to Chapter 11 so far, and I find myself continually checking CCO just to confirm the veractity of statements made in the text. This should not be necessary!I believe I will pass the CID exam due to my previous CCNP studies, but no thanks are offered to this book. Boooooooo."
1,Full of Mistakes and Poorly Written,"It's hard to say where to start -- this is the most poorly written technical book I have read.It is full of mistakes, and I'm not talking about typos. I'm talking about real, substantive technical mistakes. I lost track as I was reading, but I estimate about one major mistake per page. At first I thought it was poor editing, but now I am beginning to wonder whether the authors really know the material.It is also poorly organized and very repetitive. The authors will say the same thing several times in one paragraph by just changing the order of the words. Then they will repeat themselves again in a few pages. It's very frustrating.Finally, the editing job is very poor -- missing and incorrect figures, etc.I'm very disappointed in this book, and I doubt that the reviewers who gave it 5 stars even read it. Normally I am a big fan of Cisco Press books, but this one is an exception."
4,"A lot of great info, NOT boring","I love learning, so wanted to see what people really do when in a pinch. This gives several ways to get shelter, make a fire, signal for help (mirrors work further distances then lights or smoke in daylight), some basics on injuries, sample of what foods to eat & which to avoid & more. They show you what you need in a kit or what to use in nature including some indigenous methods. I surprisingly wasn't bored at all & like another said, there's so much info, I will watch again to soak it in more."
3,A great place to start,I enjoyed this DVD. It was simple but you need to watch it more than once to get everything down. The fire making processes were in my opinion the most informative. I only wish that they spent more time on food gathering practices. This is a great compliment to the wonderful book Field Guide to Edible Wild Plants : Eastern and central North America (Peterson Field Guides). It can be found here at Amazon as well. This DVD is helpful for the avid primitive camper or the paranoid traveler that fears crashing in a remote area. Learn and enjoy!
2,Not that great,"I write this having some prior camping/adventure expieriences over the years and I got this dvd thinking it would be a good refresher ""course"". Although it covered all of the basic concerns of survival, it was not very organized and all topics left out details that could be important. I would like to see (or even make) a series of dvd's that show a survival expierience in detail involving different environments. Survivorman is a good concept (and is entertaining) but he could take that a step further in details. I think this dvd could be a good boy scout resource, but it was not for me. I will probably try to resell it."
3,"Has some useful info, but there isn't a whole lot of substance","This DVD is a pretty nice starter for wilderness survival. entertaining to watch the cheesy scripted dialogue. It gets 1 1/2 stars off for lacking humility- but it is watchable and has some great info.Other than that, most of the methods are unpractical in a survival situation, synthetic materials are almost always used in the aid of fire making and shelter building.There are a few valuable bits, there is a segment on making traps, and making fire by friction which could be applied. There is also an extensive speech by a medical expert, with many valuable tips.If your new to survival, save your money for something like the Ray Mears programs, Ron Hoods Woodsmaster series, and Survivorman is an entertaining show. This DVD is still recommended. 3 1/2 stars."
3,Not Bad...Checkout Ray Mears Instead,"Well, this isn't a bad DVD. I believe it was originally published as ""17 Ways to Build a Fire Without a Match."" The fire starting techniques are great but everything else is right out of any exhaustive survival book. So, the main focus is on fire starting. If the price is under $10 it's a worth while buy in that aspect.On the other hand, if you into survival stuff checkout the Ray Mears DVD's. Excellent material. Ray goes to all corners of the world and stays out in the elements to show you it can be done, even the arctic. You may have to get these DVD's on the Amazon.uk site and they may be in PAL format."
4,Don't Buy From Media Gold,"DO NOT buy from ""Media Gold."" They charged an outrageous price for the large David Tennant figure on the grounds that it was the last and are still doing the same though I supposedly bought the last in stock (which they are still saying ""Only one left!"") Also they deliberately shipped it though they had a cancellation order from Amazon, made me sign for it AND it was shipped in old newspapers & a smashed package! BEWARE!The figure itself is fine. The joints seem flimsy and as noted by most experts it is not a good likeness of Tennant (to be fair it's mostly that the hair is on the line of Matt Smith rather than David Tennant. The biggest loss is the lack of the classic brown trench coat.No figure is worth the ridiculous price from Media Gold unless it's genuinely rare. Don't buy products or the lies of Media Gold."
5,5 stars not enough for this song,"This is my favorite RHCP song ever, even ahead of Under the Bridge and Scar Tissue. Flea's bass is amazing. Melody is smooth and soulful. Lyrics are amazing. Wow, this is auditory ecstasy!"
5,THE BEST CHILI PEPPER SONG EVER!!,"Soul to squeeze is no doubt the best chili pepper song ever! If you liked under the bridge, youll love this song. So smooth,and mellow. It is in a way sad. The lyrics make perfect sense. I never get sick of this. One question: Why wasnt it released?"
4,"A dark ""To Kill a Mockingbird""","This is a coming of age novel with a dark twist. On the surface, there's a simple suspense tale about a young girl and her brother caught in the grip of a profoundly dysfunctional family. Beyond that, it is a study in the faces and origins of evil, and how evil finds its way into people's lives. Do we invite it, does it charm its way in, or does it sneak up on us without our realizing it.The narrator's mother is an intriguing character, a woman with a desire for love and a taste for self-destruction who brings mortal peril into her own home. Her son pines for a convicted killer that he's never met.Some sweet quirky chracters, some twisted ones, a few surprising plot turns (though a couple perhaps not quite so surprising as the author expected) and a lovely poetic voice make this a good read. Definitely best for a long, dark rainy afternoon-- there really is no good place to stop in this work."
5,The Absence of Nectar,"Anyone who has grown up with the problem of an abusive step parent can probably understand the authors representation of her characters. Meg, Alice and Boone fit perfectly as an exaggeration of a disfunctional, disallusioned single parent family. Their desperation to survive as best they can, are marvelously tempered with the challenges they are faced with. I loved Numbhead, and the wit of Alice as she trys to protect lovesick Boone. I reccomend this book to all of you who enjoyed ""Drowning Ruth"". I know I will read it again."
4,No absence of sadness in this book!,"Absence of Nectar by Kathy Hepinstall is a coming of age novel set in the early 70's in Texas. This was a strange and distrubing novel which tells of the life of a young 12 year old and her brother who is 14.When their mother remarries these two children are afraid for thier lives as their step-father becomes more and more abusive. Parallel to this story is the tale of a young woman who has escaped from a prison and eventaully fits into the story of the two young protagonists.This was the third book I read by this author and while I found it a worthwhile read, I found the two previous books I read, The House of Gentlemen and Prince of Lost Places more intriguing. Still, Hepinstall is a writer worth reading since she leaves you with a lot to think about. I look forward to reading more books by her in the future."
1,Absence of talent,"This plot was in a word, dreck.Kathy should write romance novels for disfunctual women who have no idea how to relate to the real world. I HATED THIS BOOK! I would have stopped reading, but was compelled to see actaully how bad it would get... Don't buy this book."
5,A very exciting and pageturning novel,"I read this book my freshman year in high school and did a speech on it for a book talk. Now, I am a freshman in college and I still love reading it. It is a very mysterious and haunting story at times that made me feel as though I was running through pages right along with the characters. I think anyone who enjoys a great mystery and is able to really get lost in a book, this is just the one to do it with!"
5,Chilling & Suspenseful,"Meet Alice & Boone-two young siblings living with their mother & their new step-father Simon Jester. Simon will have you shaking in your boots-as he has the children. Convinced that Simon is out to kill them, Alice & Simon live in fear of having their food poisoned or any other tactics Simon might use to get rid of them. This book has the reader in true suspense. Is Simon really trying to kill them, or are the children's imaginations running wild? Not only is Hepinstall's writing fantastic, she creates Alice & Boone into two children who are not only smart and witty, but have incredible character depth. This novel has a chilling element of suspense but also a great demonstration on the bonds of sibling love and loyalty. There are also some laugh out loud moments as Alice and Boone have some witty wise-cracks and sarcasm that they play off of one another that provides a little comic relief throughout the novel. I couldn't put this book down!"
3,Very Good Carver Collection,"If you haven't read Raymond Carver before, this is probably the wrong book with which you should start. His stories ""Cathedral"", ""Nobody Said Anything"", and ""Where I'm Calling From"" (to name just a few of my favorites) represent his best work; the stories contained in ""Elephant"" do not. Although ""Intimacy"" and ""Blackbird Pie"" are two very strong stories in ""Elephant"", I would reach back further if you truly want to enjoy Carver at his best. This book is really only worth the money if you are a Carver completist looking to own everything he put into print."
5,Great Book on ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE from DK,Dorling Kindersley makes great looking books. This book for Disney's ATLANTIS: THE LOST EMPIRE is very nice. It covers each character and hardware used in the film and is both captivating and educational. Excellent!
1,Not recommended,Two out of three failed within 6 months. Spend a little more and get the Coolermaster.Would not recommend these in a critical install.
3,Moves air ... loudly,"I bought this fan to replace a failed one in one of my external HD enclosures. Yes, this fan moves air, but it does so extremely loudly. Loud enough that I won't leave the enclosure turned on at night since it's in the bedroom."
1,Wrong fan.,I got a 35mm fan that was in a 35mm fan box with a sticker over the correct measurements replace with this fan's stats. I am needless to say disappointed and will take my business elsewhere.I would recommend ordering from a different supplier.
4,Good for awkward oil filter locations where access is difficult,"Works well for the E30 model BMW I have where the oil filter is somewhat difficult to reach and tighten appropriately. I found the nut on the end gives me the peace of mind that I'll be able to unscrew the oil filter without having to use an oil filter wrench that tends to crush the oil filter. Requires either a 1"" socket or wrench."
4,Excellent vocabulary and phrase building tool.,"This was an excellent tool to build vocab. The voices were pleasant. I am Vietnamese and wanted to improve and this had exceptionally useful words and phrases that have helped me conversationally when speaking to my (very traditional) family. I must clarify, in Vietnamese culture we are very polite, but also human, rudeness is in the context and the tone of voice- See the first comment from level One, that was a very accurrate assessment."
1,Fails to understand culture,I purchased this program and find it offensive. The person who designed the program obviously knew nothing about Vietnamese culture. If I used most of the phrases in the program the Vietnamese people would turn away in digust. The Vietnamese are not a confrontive people and most of the phrases are just that. The word lists are mostly unusable for everyday life. The only good thing about the program is the pronounceation.I will certainly not recommend this program and will tell people not to go near it unless they want to make enemies in Viet Nam.
5,A great book for the novice,"I caught the cricket bug recently, but didn't really know what the game was all about. This book covers play, rules and general information about the game in an entertaining manner."
4,Baseline understanding of Cricket,A good basic understanding of the game. Gives the reader a baseline knowledge for those new to the game and want to follow international cricket in countries like U.S. Where game is not widely played.
3,deceptive title,"Robert Eastaway wrote a terrific little book called ""What Is A Googly?"", which is a beginner's guide to the game of cricket. Knowing this, I ordered what I thought was a second book on the topic. Sadly, it is the same book, printed from the same plates. Only the title is different. I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't think this reprint with new title was verging on fraud."
2,this album is horrible,"i'm sorry, i'd like to think i'm a real hip-hop head and a true wu fan.this album is half ass. horrible production. lazy and uninspiring lyrics that make this generic new york album seem like lyrical nyquil.lil dap would sound better over these beats. it pains me cuz ps is dope. he was great on the sunz of man album and killed that think differently compilation.i rarely buy albums and it's because i'm always getting burnt like this one. no hate, if you know who i am you'll know i'm not hating because its easy.i'm hating cuz PS is a dope rapper with a halfass album. he could have done better, instead he made u-god seem like rakim."
2,"Too many feelings, too little facts","This book reads more like a young girl's diary with dreamy references to ""natives"" and ""pristine wilderness"" as if they were boys she hoped would chase her. And, oh!, the evil humans (Americans) and evil oil!! Ms Lord seems to forget that humans are natural and from planet Earth too. The book could also use some darn maps. I'm glad I picked this up in the library instead of purchasing it. Maybe you should do the same!!"
2,Not up to the standards of Dead Gentlemen Productions,"I will rate this against others in its weight class. The Gamers, and especially Dorkness Rising are far superior to this. I expected inexpensive production values. The writing was bad, jokes were driven into the ground far too often. It just wasn't as good as other films in its class. The basic idea is good and the twist ending amusing. Between those two points we get the same jokes over and over."
5,A thorough well presented mountain of facts & explaination,"Great for anyone who wants a ""hands-on"" guide to the mechanics of scanning & printing. Lots of comparison charts to show different techniques, loads of explination of those hard to grasp subjects. Brilliant worked tables. Well worth the money! :O)"
5,I highly reccomend Inside MicroStation 95,"Inside MicroStation 95 has helped me considerably to understand how to operate MicroStation. Before I read this book I had no previous knowledge of any other CAD software. Now I feel completely confident using MicroStation. As an architecture student, I don't have much time to sit around and read thousand-page books that confuse more than help me. Inside Microstation was easy to read and understand, and I finished it in about 2 weeks."
2,Not Quite V8,"This book is not for advanced users wanting to learn more about V8 or its working as it deals very sparingly with V8.The book should rather be called ""Outside Microstation V8 Looking In"""
2,Not what it should be...,"This book is another retelling of beginner basics. The sixth edition seems to be merely a cut and paste of previous editions, with a couple of gratuitous references to V8 thrown in for marketing spice. I found it useless in the transition (from J & SE)to V8. If you are hoping for insight into the Autocad interoperability issues, I suggest you look elsewhere. Although an impressive looking paperweight, experienced users purchasing this book are kissing fifty-plus bucks goodbye."
5,A necessity for every PC Techie's toolkit,"There isn't much to say but that you get approx. 350 different screws, nuts and mounts (metal and plastic), which includes a couple I have never even seen or used before. 12 different comparments details the type, size and function of each screw you'll use. Simply very good stuff. Get it. You'll need it sooner or later."
5,It's a bunch of screws. Everything you'd need building a computer.,"So I bought a case for my new build. It came with eight motherboard offsets and one motherboard offset that hadn't been threaded. WTFEnter this product. It has said motherboard offsets but so much more. It has screws for hard drives, optical drives, case screws, nuts, and more.Bottom line: if you build and maintain computers, this is a must-have."
4,Nice Screw kit..but pricey for what you get!,"This PC screw assortment kit is great. I love the fact that they have a label on the top describing what each screw is for.I am pleased with this kit but you can get other screw kits for less, and get more screws, etc, for your money.PWN"
4,Marin County Morons,"This is a brilliant satire of Marin County, California residents and their obsessions with ""New Age"" nonsense; political correctness, weird sexual fads, ""finding"" one's self, religious cults, and ridiculous psycho-babble terminology. While this movie was made in 1980, its satire is still (sad to say) applicable in today's California.Martin Mull, in his first starring role, plays the only seemingly sane person in his circle of friends (as his precocious young neighbor points out, ""The sane man must appear to be mad in an insane world""). Mull's dry wit is perfectly in tune with a script that gives him lots of truly memorable comic lines (""Your name is just ""woman""? How do you get your mail?"").Mull is joined in the cast by other 1980s-era stars like Sally Kellerman, Bill Macy, Tom Smothers, Peter Bonerz, and Christopher Lee. Don't miss this one!"
3,"Good service, poor product","The delivery and service by this vendor were fine but the DVD itself was sub-par. Although the video portion is OK, the sound is not. It sounds like it was dubbed off a VHS tape and not very well. Many parts of it are hard to understand. Maybe that's just the nature of the beast and can't be made any better, but we were disappointed."
3,I only heard of this movie,"I would love to watch it but why do I have to buy it? It is ridiculous.I just want to rents it once.Well, I bought it. It was amusing in many ways but also very corny. The plot is predictable. I wish I was for rent. I think it worth $2.99 but no $9.00"
1,The Absolute Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"I saw this movie when it was first released and wondered why it was ever even made. I hoped that they had burned the negatives on this one. Even Martin Mull would probably admit it was not his best work. I am a huge fan of Martin Mull's, but this film was the worst thing I've ever seen. That is, up until this point in my life. Rent, don't buy it if you absolutely must see this...YUCK!"
4,"Good, But Not As Good As I Remembered","The DVD is fine as tro the quality of the video, sound etc. I did not enjoy this movie as much as I originally did. It is still a funny tkae on the 60's CA lifestyles, and can be enjoyable if you have never seen it before."
5,This movie is a snapshot of America's mid 70's attempts to grow,"This is a sexy, funny movie that I used to watch almost nightly on HBO as a kid. Now, 25 years later, this movie is a period piece about California in the mid 70's, and everything that was so silly about that time and place.It's Martin Mull at his peak, and be warned, even his most lighthearted comedy can be very dark and cynical. This is no exception.I can't say enough good things about this movie and it's all star cast.Sit back and watch an everyday kind of guy try not get swept away in a time of sexual revolution and new found social awareness. Join Harvey on his encounters with desperate housewives, gay outlaw bikers, pill popping shrinks, free love hippies, religious cults, and teenagers who know everything!"
4,From the 70s with love,"My husband has been talking about this movie for years. I finally found the DVD on Amazon. We just finished watching it...he still loves it. The movie pokes fun at everyone and everything that was part of the 70s and the me generation in California. I liked it too. It's an adult comedy with some fine performances from Martin Mull, Tuesday Weld, Sally Kellerman, and Bill Macy. I'm not sure that viewers who didn't experience that time, would find it as funny as we did.I have to agree that the sound quality wasn't the greatest. We watched it on a small screen so I can't comment on the picture quality."
5,Fantastic if this is what your after.,"I must say that I LOVE this book, but that's because I'm very much in to chivalric culture (especially of the 14thC!) I don't know how wide an appeal such a specific book has, but for those who have some background understanding of this topic and still can't get enough; your in for a treat..."
3,Boring.,"I really did not enjoy this book. It started out pretty interesting, but after the writer got to Europe it devolved into, ""we drove and drove some more."" There is very little details about any of the battles this unit was involved in, it pretty much deals with the author and his unit driving until the end of the war. I understand he was a ""tank driver"" although he did command a few tanks during a few times during the war, but it would have been a better book if he had provided more details of the battles his company had."
5,I learned more !,"Before reading ""Tank driver"", I believed I knew all about 41st Tk Bn. It was a mistake ! Ted Hartman tought more to me. And it is written in very pleasant way, not too hard to understand for a Frenchspeaking Belgian like me.What I appreciated the most is being ""plunged"" in the atmosphere of the time of the war. And of course, I was able to recognize some friends of mine in the story told by the writer.A very good job made by Ted Hartman. I would commend this book to all the foreigners who speaks just a little bit English."
3,"Not bad, not bad at all","It's not the dreary new age rehash I was expecting. Sure, it's a bit easy listening in places, but mostly it's a synth-heavy reworking with a touch of techno styling.On balance, I like it a little more than Tubular Bells II, if only because it skips the Piltdown Man entirely rather than making it a joke, and because it's more subtle in its reworking of themes from the original Tubular Bells.I'd like it even more without the obligatory attempt at a hit single (""Man In The Rain"") breaking up the flow, though."
5,another great incarnation,"The Tubular Bells series has done nothing but improve since the origional. TB3 is no exception to this tread. TB2 was excellent, as was the the origional. This fits in as a great album as well. To date, this is the best version of TB. If he makes a TB4, I'd get that, too; he hasn't made a bad Tubular Bells album, and I don't think this trend will stop. It didn't with the third."
4,"Oh, You beautiful bell.","Maybe not quite as good as TB2, but still stunning. Mike's abilities never cease to astound. Some Spanish influence here, with a beautiful keyboard interlude that's dreamy. The last track will send shivers up the spine of any Oldfield fan."
2,Been there.... done that,"No, sorry. I'm afraid this adds nothing to TB1 and TB2. It's just a bad case of deja vue, repackaged and re-marketed to relieve you of more of your hard earned cash.Save yourself some money and dig out your old copy of TB2 instead ...."
3,Not up to his best stuff,"Unlike TB and TB2 this album doesn't reflect the best Mike Oldfield. There are tubular bells in the album but that's where the resemblance ends. You will probably like it if you really like Songs From Earth. If you don't like over processed music, don't bother."
3,Uneven But 2 great Tracks,"I found the production of this album a bit uneven, but there are two great tracks I had to have, the best one being ""Man In The Rain"""
3,"Yes, No. What happened?","This one better be good. Of course anything that Mike does has got to be good. And it was. I like the techno trance thing in the beginning along with the unmistakable tubular bells theme throuought. When will Piltdown Man ever get his day in court? Hasn't he suffered enough. I was disappointed that Mike didn't stick to the introducing of each instrument as theme and variation as he had done in the previous 2bular bells. Here he missed a golden, correction, platinum opportunity to use the voices of kids announcing each instrument toward the finale. Worth listening? Yes."
3,Tubular Bells Pt. 3?!,"I fail to see why Oldfield is still using the TB moniker. After all, there is no improving on the original so he should make this the last one in the Tubular Bells series. An interesting cd with a very good track- 7/Man in the rain, a few interesting moments but I actually like Tubular Bells 2 better. Certainly not the killer cd I had hoped it would be. (...) Sound quality is very good."
5,The Bell Revisited,The second re-interpretation of Mike's Prime Opera is modern and refreshing. TBIII stands in the among the top five of Mike's finest examples and should be a MUST for anyone who likes good progressive rock music.
2,Old movie with bad conversion to digital,"This is an old movie. It has not been cleaned up in any way, so the colors are very washed out, and the dirt and scratches are all there to see (over and over). I am sure in 1958 it was probably a pretty good movie, but it has not aged well. I couldn't sit through the whole thing."
2,overpriced and now broken,"Was okay at first, but the center spinning mechanism that locks down for storage does not lock down anymore. Also, when storing it in the fridge, there is a rubber piece to cover the center hole, but the sides still are not a good seal where the water is poured from when the lid is on. So the salad still does not last, and I cannot store it in this container. I spent a lot of money, and now am buying a new one. dont buy this one, its garbage. Not something I expected from KitchenAid."
1,Worse than Ikea salad spinner!,Only if it works being able to divide compartments for different vegetables/herbs seems like a good idea. Unfortunately KitchenAid doesn't work so well. Everything ends up mixed together because they fly over the dividers. That's only if it spins well. It's somewhat difficult to push down the button in order to make a full spin.My three-dollar IKEA's salad spinner works far better than this crap!
3,Wow!,"Wow! I guess this record has become quite rare.....I remember bumpin' this record circa '95........can't find it anywhere, except used on this site for 50 bucks. Ouch!"
1,Disgusting,"No other way to describe it, the product tastes atrocious. If you are a serious bodybuilder only then consider, then you might be willing to take the pain of swallowing this nasty protein."
3,Still too noisy,I bought these fans to replace some noisy fans in a new 2U computer case. These are almost as noisy as the originals.
5,Even Better in Person . . .,"This poster is AMAZING! The color is great and the paper quality is nice, too! Looks great in a black framed poster!"
5,Great Book,This is a great book to use when you need to dust off the ole math skills. I was never all that great at math and I needed to brush up on mostly all of my math concepts for the GRE exam. This book was a great help to me in that process.
2,this book reminds me why I hated math class,"I finished 3/4 of this book in an attempt to make up for my math deficiencies and to do better on standardized tests. I realized to continue with the author's viewpoint would be futile since I learned to hate the book. The author does well on the early chapters of reviewing basics but stumbles in later sections. Algebra seems to be a particular problem for her to explain clearly and there are shockingly short details. In short, there are not enough explanations, examples, and working through problems. The annoying tone of the author grated on me with her quasi-cheerleading and flat jokes. I would appreciate a more comprehensive answer section which would explain the process. True math confidence can be achieved with hard work, good explanations, and repetition. This book does not deliver. My math tutor, who is a PhD in math, started to cross out sections of the book. I think that says it all."
2,a little dissapointed,When purchasing this i had read through all the reviews at the which were generally very positive.in all it is not so much that this is a bad DVD but more that it is not nearly as good as i thought it would be based on the other reviews. Generally it looks very outdated i.e. early 90's and the nubmer of drills and advanced information is pretty limited.i do however like that it does have drills that are accessable outside rewatching the main DVD.If you want something basic that gives you a few drills and a few very short clips of people doing them and running properly then this is for you just dont get your hopes up much more than that.
5,Abosuletly Five Stars,"I got this DVD because of all the good reviews, and I am glad I did. My very first run after watching this DVD was like night and day. And I thought-- because I've read similar books-- that I had pretty good form as it was. Seeing proper technique on video has really made a difference, and I now realize that I was over striding even though I was already striking with the mid part of my foot. Running has become so easy now that I've started doing it twice a day. I have no hamstring or quad fatigue. My obliques have become more involved and seem to be working in conjunction with my gluts which have become the main muscles propelling me forward-- I can feel my gluts doing most of the work now, but these muscles are so big and so powerful that it feels easy to use them to drive myself forward.In my opinion this is simply a must have video for any class of runner who wants to become much more efficient or enjoy their runs more."
2,Not as expected,"I received the dvd yesterday and viewed it as well. It was as though I was looking at a book on my TV set. There were very few drills dispersed througout the video but what would have been better was to have them at the end as well, sort of a wrap-up. You will need to forward through the dvd little by little to find them. Although I run about 6 miles daily and have been doing it for awhile, I did learn some things but really the dvd was too technical. I am sure there are better dvd's to help the novice runner."
1,BEWARE - Causes plantars faciitis!!!,"I give this DVD 1 star because Zero is not an option. I have been a runner for 15 years running an average of 70 miles per week. This may sound like overtraining but I have only had one injury until now. Within 2 weeks of trying this running method I developed severe plantars faciitis in both feet. I have had it for 2 months now despite returning to my previous running form. The podiatrist has informed me that running on your forefoot is absolutly not for any distance running. He said it strains the plantar facicia and achilles tendon These tendons are inelastic - yet in the video they say you use elastic recoil. Purchasing this video is one of the stupdist purchased I have ever made in my life!!! Steer clear from this DVD. Even if you increase your speed, you highly increase your chances of injuries to your plantars and achilles. It is not worth it!!!"
5,Drive works fine and is quiet,Drive works fine and is quiet [Why must I write 14 more words!? x x x x x x x]
2,Mistitled,"First off, this title is not right. It would be better if called ""Best Of"" because KCi and JoJo only had three significant hits and those were ""All My Life"" Crazy"" and ""Tell Me It's Real."" ""All My Life"" was one of the best R&B ballads to come out of the late 90's, but the other two resembled pale imitations that revealed the duo desperately trying to live up to that monster single. They succeeded someone considering both singles got pretty decent airplay ,but nothing will ever top ""All My Life"""
3,Interesting Concept,"I've always been attractive to books on time travel where someone from now-a days travels back in time. I like to see how the time traveler reacts to a time period she may have read about but knows nothing of the day-to-day details or realities. This book appealed to me because it was time travel in reverse, ie instead of someone going back in time, someone from the past comes forward in time to jointly occupy the brain/spirit of a modern person. I gave this book a three star rating because there was much discussion, let alone any depth, of how a person from the past, in this case Cleopatra, would feel about modern times. Nor was there any discussion at all about how two different personalities deal with occupying the same body. Nevertheless it was a fun read. I hope the sequel, Cleopatra 7.2, deals with the issues I've raised."
2,Channeling Cleopatra,"Didn't like the book much, the author tried to be too girlish with her main character, and the technology was too easily believed by the other characters. Read about 1/3 and skimmed through the rest to see how it ended."
4,(3.5) Interesting Mythos Book,"I'm glad to see that there is books in the world that try and use mythology in more modern aspects. I found this book an enjoyable read to take my mind off of the world. It was an intreguing book that one wanted to finsh.The characters where perhaps they could have been better, the plot kept you wanting to know what happens next. It might follow a tipical Sci-Fi idea, this book adds some twists and turns in it that are not atypical.I would recommend anyone with an entrest in the genra to pick this one up and read it."
2,Overpowering dust and fragrance,"First, I really loveFresh Step Crystals Cat Litter, 8-Pound Bagfor containing odors, but as it's expensive I usually mix it with a clumping litter. Unfortunately, I simply cannot recommend this one. The bulk size is very economical, but there is so much dust and artificial fragrance that I practically choke on it (can even taste it! disgusting!) whenever I change the litter or my cat uses the box (even when I'm two rooms away). It's as if Fresh Step emptied a canister of powdered carpet deodorizer into the litter. With the crystals I don't need a deodorizer, so I am definitely switching to an unscented clumping litter the next time I buy."
3,Works well - leaves WAY too much perfumy dust residue,"Although my cats (2) are very comfortable doing their business in this litter -- the dust that settles over everything within 10 feet of the litter box is overwhelming and persistent. I am looking for a better alternative, even if it costs a little more."
2,"Ooh, that Smell","And it's not a good one. This cat litter is scented, a horribly strong soapy scent that takes over the entire room when I add more to the box. And if my cats have just visited the bathroom and come anywhere near me, I get a whiff too.Besides that, it really doesn't work as well as the previous brand I was using to eliminate the smell of cat waste so the soapy smell mixes with that and it's entirely unpleasant.Although the clumping capabilities are decent, they're not amazing. If this were my only complaint, I would probably still use Fresh Step Scoopable.While affordably priced and widely available, Fresh Step Scoopable isn't the best cat litter product I've used."
5,A must have for the modern office,"I have brought very few things to my office that have pleased my nurses (and indirectly myself) as much as this handsome scale. Measuring easily in kg and lbs, it's a snap to assemble, sharp looking, and has the high weight capacity my office (and unfortunately, offices all over America) need to measure our heavier patients. You won't be disappointed. Still on the first set of AA batteries after 3 months- probably don't need the power adapter."
5,Amazing Album,"I am a big fan of Thrice and was kind of shocked when I first heard this album. The song writing is top notch, great lyrics, and truly original. Great album....buy it!"
3,Nice Try Americana,"Someone passed this CD onto me. I had no idea who it was (didn't know it was Thrice related, which is neither here nor there). I am a fan of Americana/Alt-Country, tho'. When I first heard it, I tho't, ""here is a guy who is trying a lil' too hard (maybe not enough hard knocks to sing ""the tax man is breathing down my neck"". Seemed a little canned, but what do i know?)"". If you like this you may enjoy the ""real deals"": Mark Heard, Bill Mallonee, and, of course, Johnny Cash, Neil Young, Lucinda Williams, etc.I admit it has grown on me. First track, and 2nd about his wife, are fine tunes. The ""blood and wine"" song is fun, but not much of a hook to sustain it. The rest of the album kind of peters out. Sounds like a guy who is trying something out, and that's great. I'll look forward to hearing the next one."
2,"Ehh, expecting something diff","So i expected this to be some kind of great musical offering. First, let me say I respect his work with Thrice and was looking forward to this. I think he wrote this album more as an experiment for himself, which is good but sometimes doesn't translate well to the listener. I know art is subjective so don't let a bad review stop you from checking it out."
4,Very Cute Story!,"First I must say I'm not a ""young reader"", which is who this book was written for. Susie, the main character in the book is adorable. I really enjoyed reading about all of her trials and tribulations surrounding her short hair.Also, because there is a lesson to be learned, this would be a great book for a girl that is rambunctious to read."
5,"I know nothing about dance videos, but it helped us!","I know nothing about dance videos, and this is the only one I've tried, but I think it's great. They break the steps down so they are very easy to follow and understand and don't try to make you do anything to cheesy or flashy. I think it's worth the $20 or whatever I paid."
5,"Clear, comfortable and useful instruction","I've had the pleasure of studying with Paul and Sharon in person, and -- like in their video -- they are extremely warm, thorough and clear communicators. For those who don't know, these two folks are some of the most renowned dance instructors around, and deservedly so. Get the video, and if you're anywhere near San Francisco, take their classes!"
5,Great Video!,"My husband and I used this for our first dance! Very easy to learn. We would put it on, turn down the volume, and dance it to our song. We found it works with just about any song. Huge success. Now, whenever any of our friends are getting married, they always want to borrow it! It has helped 3 first dances!"
4,Good basic video,"This video is broken down well so you can follow from the beginning or skip around if you like. Has good basic dances and ""moving together"" section to teach more than steps. I wish there was more time where music played to practice steps- we ended up getting out our iPod for more practice time. Alas, it still did not fix my fiance's lack of rythym!"
4,Perfect for that 'first dance',This DVD really helped me and especially my husband as we prepared for our first dance.
2,Too Hard to Follow,Bought it because the reviews said it was basic and simple to learn. My husband didn't even watch it! It was not information or descriptive enough. We ended up going to an actual dance class
5,This DVD works. Forget the rest.,"I've tried dance videos before. They've all been miserable, frustrating, horrible! Not to say all dance videos are bad, but if you've ever been frustrated by dancing or a dance video before, I think you know what I mean.This DVD is different. The instruction on this disc isn't confusing at all. Quite the contrary, if you simply watch the short section called ""Moving Together"" you'll learn how to lead or follow in about 30 minutes. Then you can fake your way through any dance.I hate to use the ""two left feet"" cliche, but I've always felt that way until my Fiance bought this DVD. We literally practiced for less than an hour, and we pulled off our wedding dance without a hitch. We even got a bunch of compliments, and look good in the video. Who could ask for more?Why are you still reading? Add this disc to your basket. You won't regret it!"
1,WORST BOOK EVER--,"This book is beyond HORRIBLE. I even went and consulted with the Oxford's alumni office and checked if the credentials of this author were genuine.The book is confusing, lacks comprehensive references, and sounds like an ""ode to Chavez"" instead of true investigative journalism. He uses this book to express his frustration towards Bush over and over, without providing real facts and analysis about the situation in Venezuela.Do not waste your time nor your money. I wished this author had taken the time to speak with poor people in Venezuela who are not members of the ""one Party"" that Chavez has created"
2,Budget Horror,I found this bin for 5 bucks at Wal Mart. Too cheap to psss up on that price. But these films have little to offer outside of some nude scenes and horror violence. i wouldn't recommend it.
2,Difficult to read,Chock full of information and details. Every sentence is packed with information. Each sentence is like a chaptermaking slow and difficult reading.
3,Very biased,"Although the book is packed with detailed information about all stages of development of Jewish State in Palestine and is undoubtedly one of the most comprehensive sources of information, i gave it only 3 stars because the author is obviously biased in most of his judgments and analysis.I realize that there is no history completely divorced from subjective judgment of the author but this book borders on leftist propaganda literature."
5,The definitive work of reference,"I read this book 8 years ago, and it has made an indelible impression on me. Whenever I hear people speak about Israel, be it positively or negatively, I refer them to Howard Sachar's scholarship, and say, ""Learn what you are talking about."" While Sachar is no apologist for the religious Right, it is hard to read the history he details and come away with anything other than reverence for what this nation has achieved. As a proud, assimilated, American Jew. Sachar's explanation of how Israel came into being and the progress it has made over the last 65 years fills me with conviction that Israel's destiny must remain in its own hands. As the great-grandchild of Holocaust victims, I know what Israel means to me, both now and forever--it is the only game in town, when the rubber meets the road. No one explains the background of this emotion, and the rationale behind it, better than Sachar. Read this book, no matter your ideology."
4,A fine book.,"I have read the second edition a few times. I don't have the third. It is a fine book. It is a synthesis for the general reader, with all that goes with that. It is hard to write such a book well, and he does it very well. If I remember right he provides a quite middle-of-the-road view. Doesn't overstate the good or the bad, dwells more on political and military matters than the rest."
3,"Very thorough, a bit slow.","I have owned this book for quite some while. I finally took the time to make my way through all 1000+ pages. No doubt it is very well researched. It is very comprehensive with solid citations. It covers the history of Zionism from around the mid to late 1800's through the creation of the state of Israel into the mid 1990's. It is written, for the most part, in chronological order, but it does tend to be a bit redundant in spots. And, no matter how great a writer you may be, it is just downright impossible to make the history behind the formation of the various coalition governments exciting for the reader."
2,Junky,No where does it state that this is a black and white tv converter. Also this item seems to become extremely hot. The screen size was also uncompatable with my tv.
3,I was fooled by the word 'vignettes',"I needed a journal to take with me on my choir director's Celtic Tour this summer, and as I'm a devotee of Sulamith Wulfing, this journal seemed like a perfect match.The cover and end cover are decorated by two of Wulfing's images in color (no reference to their titles). The endpaper is a complex decorative motif of leaves and flowers, in rose and beige tones. The vignettes were a little disappointing: small and colored in rose tones. I was expecting the images to be bigger and a bit less monochrome.However, this is a very sturdy journal. Front and cover qualify as hardbound and there is a double-spiral wire holding the pages together. Facing pages contain one blank sheet (except for a small decorative motif top and bottom) and one lined sheet to record your thoughts. The paper is heavy enough so you could do pencil and possibly even ink drawings on the blank page. I wouldn't recommend water colors."
4,Nice kid watch to keep time and also alarm,"My 6-year-old started the swim team this year and he needed a watch to remind him to go change into his swimsuit. This alarm function is super! The watch itself is a bit difficult to learn all of the functions but once you get a hang of it, it's pretty easy."
5,Great for potty training!,"Hi got this watch for my two and a half year old to year and set the timer to remind him to use the potty. It works great, fits his tiny wrist perfectly and has been a very effective tool in reminding him to go potty. He feels like a big boy for wearing a watch (none of his friends have one!) and it has a lot of other functions we still don't even use.This watch did what it was supposed to do and is great for small wrists!"
1,Disappointed in product,"Very disappointed in the Timex Kid's Stretch Strap Watch that I ordered for my 7 yr. old grand daughter, especially after reading the reveiws on Amazon. The product arrived on time and I gave it to my grand daughter and it did not work correctly almost immediately. The Indiglo light worked sometimes. Not sure if it was the battery or not but the watch should have worked for more than one day!! Returned the watch for credit and went to a local store and bought another watch for my grand daughter."
5,A creative & courageous proposition,"GeorgeJerjian goes beyond the repetitive attempts to prove the Armenian genocide, which is already been provedbeyond doubt. He offers a SOLUTION. He also points out that while Turks want reconciliation without the truth, Armenians want the truth without reconciliation.Jerjian's proposition is creative,courageous and builds bridges in times when divisions and hatred of the other is prevalent. We all need to be exposed to solutions that can bring opposites together. This book is truly a remarkable and inspiring achievement because it instills hope in a very original way."
5,Give this book to everyone on your Christmas List,"George Jerjian's book is a gift to each of us. His use of the language, structure and ability to evoke real emotions is truly amazing. I found this to be a quick read, and read it in an hour. The author tugs at heartstrings, provokes thought and offers a solution. Give this book to everyone on your Christmas list."
5,Streets are Always Watching...,"OK.... I just finished the 2nd reading of the DUTCH series!!! Enjoyed it from beginning to end (although I must say the Dutch tale doesn't stop here!!) Angel, Rahman, even Nina.... Twists, Turns, Deceit, dashed with Love (if one considers what these characters go through! DAMN!)... Craved for more, so can somebody tell me where I can get my hands on 'Dutch III, The Final Chapter?"""
5,MONEY THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL?,"They say money is the root of all evil. Well I beg to differ. If you read this book you will definitely know what the true answer is. And what makes the world really go round. LIKE THEY SAY IT IS ALL POWER!!!!!A must read, a true page turner, can't wait for the last book!!!"
3,LMAO Y'all!,"LMAOI thought the last Dutch was the finale. This one was --meh.OK.Was it worth paying the money?I liked it pretty well. Something way better though is that book byDarling Nikki. ""Warm Leatherette"" by Darling Nikki. Now that sh** wasstupid in a good way! Sexy too! I like black love stories with passionatesex scenes as long as its love & not just sex. Thoroughly enjoyed ""WarmLeatherette"" & the Black Mafia was rocking that!I think I'm done with DUTCH. Teri need to start up a new line."
4,About This Book,"I think this is a very good book. Someone had loaned me Dutch and as soon as I read that one I hurried up and ordered Dutch II. Once it arrived it took me 1 day to read it. I can't wait for Dutch III. Every book lover should read this book. The plot is good, the characters were good, even the way the book was written was good. Angel is a force to be wrecken with. And the ending, I was in complete shock that her girlfriend was a undercover cop. That was the perfect cliff hanger because I am definitely hungry for more."
4,Worth the Wait!!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book...it wasn't five stars like the first one but it was still a great book!!!!! I can't wait for Part III. I love Teri Woods as an author. Angel did her thing in this book....you really learn how far angel would go for her love for Dutch!!! She made me feel proud to be a woman, and of course we still can't forget about Dutch!!!!! The ending was the best part!!! I repeat, i can't wait for part 3. Please bring it out so i can stop suffering!!!!!! ....liz"
4,luved it,"This was a good book, the end blew me away, I totally wasn't expecting that. The Muslim twist was kind of blowing me, but Angel's antics more than made up for it. That broad is wild. I can't wait for Dutch III."
4,when are u coming out with part three,hi teri i have read both of your dutch trilogy and i was wondering when are you coming out with part three. becaue i cant wait it was that good.monique
5,Excellent,I'm a great fan of Teri Woods books. Her books draw you in and keep you hooked from the first page to the last. I can't wait for Dutch III to be released.
3,The 1st one was better,"Now, Dutch II was okay. I liked the story and everything but I really could have cared less about how Angel ended up. After that crazy ending in Dutch I was looking forward to seeing what he was going to be doing in the sequel. I guess I'll just have to wait for the third book to drop. Other than that this story was str8. It didnt really fulfill my reader's digest but it was worth the 15 bucks. Good Job Teri Woods, (Please hurry with the 3rd book):)"
5,Off The Chain!!!,"Oh my goodness! What can I say?! Dutch II is off the chain!!! I read it in 2 days...stayed up 'til 4am because I couldn't go to sleep without finding out what would happen next. I loved Dutch, but Dutch II is incredible! I agree with the other reviewer, I can't wait another 2 years for Dutch III, don't torture us Teri! lol I definitely see these novels on the big screen....but...but the casting's gotta be tight because the characters are no joke! I love the alluding to Dutch throughout the whole book. That was part of the mystique too that kept me reading, to see if he would appear. Love how it was formatted, written and told, the characters felt very real! Kudos!! Numero tres bring it on!"
5,Keep it Coming Teri,Part 2 is crazy I wonder how the next will even begin. This book keeps you on edge for whats to come. I Love It!
3,What is this?,"I have to say after all the anticipitation I had about this book, i was sadly disappointed. I want Dutch! I want Dutch! There are no substitutions for his characters and the beef between Angel and Roc did not quench my reader's thirst. The ending redeemed the rest of the book because she threw Craze in their and made references to Dutch through his old girl friend. I can't wait for the third one because I want to read about Dutch and see if goldilocks is going to bust him. This book could have been skipped over so I would not recommend it. Read Dutch 1 though because it was one of the best I've ever read. What's next? I dont know but I hope that it is worth the read."
4,Angel dont play!,This book was a very good read. I liked it better than the first installment to this trilogy. I cant wait for the sequel.
5,Beautiful and Mind Blowing,"This poster is absolutely amazing. The small thumbnail provided by amazon doesn't do the poster justice. There is so much going on in this poster and so much to see. Also, the poster is of beautiful quality. It was delivered in a great condition and came very quickly."
3,Posters = Cool EZHang Frames + cust. service = BAD,"The posters themselves are sweet but the ""custom ez hang frames"" are worthless. My posters fell repeatedly to the ground, damaging the posters.I emailed poster revolution stating I wasn't happy with the frames. I recieved a call from poster revolution, where I was told that the items were described correctly and that the frames were a negligible 2-3 dollars apiece. She then argued with me that they change the prices often. If they change the prices often how can you say it's only a 2-3 dollar difference when I can clearly see on amazon a 6-8 dollar difference.In any case I felt like they called me up to simply argue with me. Not cool.I returned my 3-poster with frames $50 purchase, and ordered 5 poseters without frames for $20 less. *Frame FAIL*"
5,Amazing!,"This poster is amazing. I love the detail of the artwork, the size of the poster is huge, and it looks great in my bedroom. I've had a few friends come over and they really loved it, and complimented it."
5,great service!,the poster was received very fast and was in perfect condition. It is really cool. I could not have asked for a better experience. It only cost me $.01!
5,AWSEOME,every person that sees this poster hanging in my hall just stairs at it for ever. Trippy artwork is the best artwork
5,Pretty sweet.,"Received poser in great condition. The image is intriguing, it's one of those images that you can stare at for a while because it's so busy."
5,Five Dollars Worth of Awesome,"The poster came a day before the estimated delivery time. It is in perfect condition, not a single flaw. I love it so much and could not have been happier spending 81 cents plus shipping on this piece of printed art."
2,Quiet? Not quite.,"I bought this to replace a noisy fan in my 8 year old computer. The ad says it's ""quiet"", and the other reviewer said it's ""quiet"". However, it's just as noisy as the fan it replaced. I gave it two stars instead of one because it fit great, installed easily, and functioned."
2,Disappointed,"Was looking forward to receiving this item as it was attractive and said it was approved by the U.S. Postal Service. When the mailbox arrived it was immediately obvious that the door latch was inferior and would not remain closed. We discussed various ways to keep the door closed but did not feel that we should pay over $100 for a mailbox that had to be 'rigged' to work, compromising the appearance of the mail box w/no guarantee that anything we came up with would work. Would not recommend this product."
4,Classy Mailbox,"This is a quality mailbox, solid, and good construction. Not so huge either, visually, as I had initially thought. Only problem is that the door doesn't always stay closed - we had to put some duct tape over the little nub that the door catches on to give it a better grip."
5,Great history book for homeschooling!,"I am currently using the first book in The History of US to teach history to my homeschooled children, ages 9 and 6. Written for children, the books tell a story of being a time and space traveller, and visiting chronologically the stages of development of the Unites States. The first book starts in the Ice Age, with Asians crossing the land bridge, and follows up through Native American tribes, ending with explorers from Europe.I'd say these books are probably around a 6th grade reading level, and they are fun, interesting, and capture the imagination as well as teach an awful lot about history. The perspective of the books is that no one view of history is correct, and your child is expected to formulate his/her own ideas about what is right and wrong (for example, about forcing ""native americans"" to live on reservations.)I highly recommend the first book in the series, and I can hardly wait to finish it up, so we can start in on the next one!"
5,These are the BEST of history for younger kids.,"Joy Hakim uses lots of pictures, quotes and information on unusual tools to bring history alive. THese books are well laid out and easy to read. Nothing boring here."
1,i will not let my children read this book,"As an avid, albeit amateur reader of prehistory through Native Americans, I found this book to be appalling. In one chapterm the author states that the Native Americans wasted the buffalo, leaving their bodies to rot and wasting meat. This, unfortunately, would have been the doings of the white man - the ""Indian"" wanted all parts of the animal, not just the tongue and tail. I was horrified, and will make sure my children's schools will never read this book, unless as an example of twisted ""facts""."
4,A story of Hope and Courage and Love,"I had the incredible fortune of getting to know the Reeve family through my position with The Maritime Aquarium in Norwalk, CT following Chris' accident.I had even met all 3 of his children. Matthew's tribute to the strength and courage of is father as amazing.I am even more touched by Chris' determination in the face of 8 years of paralysis and the honesty that Matt documents it. This is for anyone who thinks their situation is hopeless.Way to go Matt and God Bless!~Tom Ryan (Philadelphia, PA)"
5,Dry Boots the next day,"I've been skiing for so many years and it's always a problem skiing multiple days when your boots are not dry from the day before. This heater is terrific ! It's got a low radiant heat that works great overnight. My boots and gloves go on when I get home from one day and the next morning, I'm good to go. The warmth keeps the boot itself soft to put on easier the next day as well. Great product... I don't know how I lived without it !!"
5,love it,I am so happy with this boot dryer. As soon as my kids get home from school they put their boot on the dryer and turn it on. The next morning they have warm dry boots.
4,Don't use on lightweight running shoes,"Love this for heavy shoes and boots. However, it melted my daughters running shoes. Be careful not to leave lightweight shoes on it for too long."
4,Gets the job done,"We live in the northeast where we are skiing, snowshoeing, and constantly coming in the house with wet boots and mittens. I wanted to find something that didn't cost too or take up much space. This dryer works great for the price. The only problem we have had it trying to get the stand to tighten completely so it doesn't slip when two pairs of ski boots are on it. Otherwise for our family it works like a charm."
5,Great Product,"I have owned 3 different types of boot / glove warmers and this one is the best by far! I use it for gloves, ski boots, winter boots and shoes etc. I now own 4 of these babies. I love em."
2,For indoor use only not cold garages,I purchased 5 of these and mounted them in my unheated garage to heat and dry the family's ski boots after a day of skiing. Even after leaving the product on from 4pm to 8am the following morning the boots never got warm. While they were dry they were a bit cold. i guess the radiant heat these produce isn't quite hot enough to overcome my garage cold temps. This should work fine for a heated mudroom but not for a colder atmosphere. I'll have to go with a commercial unit for my particular application.
2,No idea what everyone is talking about,"I bought this product after reading the reviews. Well maybe it works good for basic usage, but I work with landscaping and snow removal. This product will not dry your boots off in time to get to work after you have soaked them. I thought it worked great when I would get home from work and my boots would be dry but I was doing work on a pond and had to get in the pond, so my boats where soaked. I put my boots on it at 6pm and tried to put my boots back on at 6am the next morning and they were still wet. Really wet in the heal........Don't buy this product if you are depending on it....."
4,DryGuy Boot Dryers,I bought 5 of these dryers and installed them on a wall. I now have 10 of the floor brackets left over and would suggest that they be listed as an option and not be included in the basic offering. I also found that the installation instructions would benefit from sequencing the steps. It turned out that it was more practical to mount the wall brackets to the dryers first (leaving enough play to turn the heating elements up or down as needed)and attach the assembly to the wall second.
1,Missing Part,"We ordered four of these Boot Dryers. They arrived on time but one of the packages had a missing Plastic Saddle clamp, so assembly was not possible."
1,Not good,"Overall quality pretty appalling. Not surprising if one takes in consideration the fact that this is in fact a bootleg recording.It was originally a radio-recording which has been thrown on cd, without knowing, consent of even payment of the majority of the participants for that matter. This is not a good way to treat musicians. Therefore: please do not buy this product."
3,"No meanings hidden, no new chords uncovered","They seem to have wanted a universal anthem and a disposable pop song. Short verses, memorable chorus, and a guitar line in the Where The Streets Have No Name and One lineage. If Backstreet Boys released this, one would call it nice and move on. Since it's U2, one searches for hidden meaning, but this is instant gratification, too lightweight for anthem status.This sits uneasily between the two, too deep in its examination of wanting to get out of a non-relationship, but not deep enough to be the generational anthem it so clearly craves.The extras on Disc One are Big Girls Are Best, a competent bit of b-side material and a thumping remix of Beautiful Day. Disc Two boasts overexcited live versions of Beautiful Day and New York, from last November's farmclub.com gig. A live Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of would have been nice."
3,Just Buy a Real One,"$49 for a tiny demo item is a bit much. You can get real pre-assembled devices for half the price, or if you assemble yourself less than that. After all it is just a peltier and a heatsink. If you DIY then be sure to apply less than the rated voltage to the peltier (maybe half), buy a relatively low wattage and maybe put a fan on the heatsink or set it in a little water since higher power full size modules put out a lot of heat. Now watch the frost form."
5,Great Stuff from a Brazilian Singer,"this one is a great stuff from an excellent brazilian singer that shows us an album smashed in a melodic music coming from Minas Gerais. Your music's composed under ingredients of mpb (música popular brasileira = popular brazilian music) added to the pop music + traces of progressive rock like the italians locanda delle fate and montefeltro, and sure also ex-band o tero!!get it already!!"
3,"HVAC Equations, Data, and Rules of Thumb","The book does not live up to expectations. Yes it does have a variety of info but it is poorly edited. You have to search for many of the non-std abrieviations. Many of the tables could have been far more useful if their content was expanded. Little backup explanation is offered. Units are not rigidly adhered to. Publishing quality is one step above a Xerox copier. Overall, not a complete waste of money but also not all it could be."
3,unorganized but occasionally useful,"This book did not live up to my expectations, yet over the years I have used it on occasion. Typically, for conversions, steam tables, general rules of thumb. If you have studied for the PE exam, you probably have most of what this book has to offer."
5,Great Resource...,"I am a recent grad and working in a engineering firm where I am constantly looking for rules of thumb, helpful design guidelines, and data pertaining to my projects. This book offers a wealth of hvac information that is organized and extremely valuable for entry hvac engineers."
3,"It's okay. I know, not real helpful, but see why.","I bought this as a souvenir after seeing one of the last shows of Phantom in Las Vegas, and they had little in the way of souvenirs left. With that said, you need a reason to buy this beyond what it is; a mediocre music box. It doesn't play very long but does what it says it will. It is made in China mostly of plastic. IMHO there is nothing particularly collectible about this other than perhaps what sentiment you attach to it. For that, it is okay."
2,Hill isn't as unbiased as the publisher tries to portray her,"This book is billed as an unbiased history/biography of Joseph Smith. I had read Fawn Brodie's, No Man Knows My History... and was ""itching"" for more. I think Ms. Hill should just openly admit that her brother wrote a major work, that she quotes liberally, while working at BYU--she may not be Mormon, but she has a vested interest in the cause... promoting her brother's work? This book was a cheap second.... Read Ms. Brodie's work"
2,"Not So Hot, KitchenAid!","We have a kitchen full of KitchenAid appliances and cookware and are very happy with them all. Unfortunately, this salad spinner falls far short of the quality I've come to expect. First of all, you have to put it together from numerous smaller parts, and as you know, anything you can put together, can fall apart. Next, the thing is just really big and bulky, using a lot of wasted space on large plastic pieces. The plunge handle seems great at first, however, if you push it all the way to the bottom it LOCKS! So you have to be careful as you're pumping it not to reach the bottom. Very annoying. Why couldn't they have designed it so that you had to twist it at the bottom to lock, or something? Anyhow, I'm just used to KitchenAid being the highest quality and using the smartest ingenuity in their design, so I'm a bit surprised by this one."
1,Pump handle locks when you use it.,"Bad design. The pump handle locks into place when you push it down to make the basket spin. So you get one push/spin and then it locks. You have to put one hand under the pump lever to keep it from going all the way down and locking, or push very lightly which produces a very low speed spin that does not spin off the excess water from the salad. I'm shopping for a replacement."
1,Horrible!,"While KitchenAid is typically a reliable manufacturer, this salad spinner is a big loser. It is honestly one of the worst product designs I've ever come across. It's impossible to spin the lettuce without causing the spinner to ""lock."" The pump itself is attached to the basket/strainer, so it's difficult to rinse things in the basket. The lid has to be carefully ""fit"" over the pump every time you want to close it. The pump itself has to be locked into the basket after every wash, so you sort of have to put it together every time. It's a disaster!"
5,"Product image incorrect, but works great (driver link here)","As others have mentioned the product image is not correct. It is a small very short cord with usb on the PC side and a female xbox input on the other. However it works great. The product never makes a claim to come with drivers, consequently it does not come with any. However, for those looking for drivers, here's a tip: google for xbcd or just visit http://www.redcl0ud.com/xbcd.html. Using this cord and XBCD I was even able to get my original XBOX Fanatec Speedster Wheel working on my PC, and even change the axis and button mapping. Lap times in GPL went down already :-)"
5,Works great,I picked this up so I could use my Xbox controller on my PC so I could play some emulator games. Once you get the drivers installed everything works perfectly.
2,Works.....but no extension,"The article works fine but is not what they advertised, that's not an extension for using on an Xbox besides the USB connectivity, just a short Xbox to USB cable, at least that's what I received.The article's picture is not even close to what it really is, a simple and short cable to connect to a USB port.I felt very disappointed when I opened the package."
4,Excellent book for learning the basics of oo design,"Although their laid-back style may not be for everyone, I have learned a lot about the basics of object oriented design and enjoyed the process. I plan to use the recommended techniques as a starting point for my own project."
2,"This book is for college students, not for professionals !","The book is pretty well structured and written for somebody having a little exposure to design. I personally felt I lost my time reading it since I already have some experience in design in another OO language. The book is definitely too much like a school text book. In particular, the chapter on database access with Java concentrates on relational db concepts instead of providing useful design and architectural hints on how to develop a multi tiers application using JDBC !"
2,This is anything but a design book,"This book tries to be all things, but not Object-Oriented Design in Java. Even some of the examples requires you to download a library from a third party company. Save your money. I recommend you buy ""applying UML and Patterns"" that will lead you into ""Design Patterns"" by the gang of 4. P.S. I felt that two starts is being kind."
4,Good introductory object-oriented textbook,"I am using this book as the textbook for a work study group. The book covers the OOD concepts that get applied over and over again in scalable software designs. Breadth is empahsized over depth in the discussion, and this trait works rather well as an introductory textbook. So far, the group has very high opinion of this book. One thing that I am not particularly impressed with is the writing style- the authors on occassions go into case studies that do not warrent the time spent."
5,Outstanding!,"The best book I've seen on OOD, and I've got a shelf devoted to this topic alone. More conversational in tone then most technical books, it read easily, while presenting concepts clearly. I'm very impressed!"
2,All about the applet,"This book has some good things to say, and it does a fair job explaining some basic designs, but the whole book is based on applets. Every example, every line of code refers to applets. If you're not insterested in applets, or are not interested in applying the applet-based examples to actual real-world code, don't buy this book. If you're into applets and want to know more about basic design patterns this book is for you."
5,Dale V.,"Needed a second serial port for printing to an older serial printer for business use. I was having issues finding a PCI serial card that would work in Windows 7 Professional and this card worked great. It came with all the drivers you would need for all operating systems, but I just let Windows install it's own drivers and it is working just fine."
5,It's just the RHCP.,"It's not the best import, but it's the RHCP Ep, so that's the best, just for that. This Ep is the number 26 in my 48 CD's collection."
3,So-so,"An ok flick if you have some time to kill and are interested in Euro thrillers from the '70s. Definitely not on the level of an Argento (or others of that ilk) giallo. Not enough nudity, gore or depravity if you're into those things (like me). Good for a quick look, but nothing memorable."
4,Great first time mystery novel,"The characters were charming, the plot was a little bit unusual, and the characters were interesting. I enjoyed this book. It was a nice easy read, maybe good for a lazy day on the porch. The ceramic pottery tips were interesting too."
2,At least the pottery information was interesting.,"The part about Southern pottery is interesting. Just enjoy that part of the book and skim over the amateur sleuth, Molly who is obnoxious. She lies and manipulates the potters and their wives, and the rather pathetic characters like the pharmacy clerk. All in the name of getting the story for her magazine and solving the murder. She has a momentary twinge or two but it doesn't stop her. Her actions when she solves the murder are appalling."
3,Pots with the Face of the Devil & a Murder,"I enjoyed the book's inclusion of interesting quotes about potmaking and pot collecting, especially of face pots from South Carolina. This is the first in a series which I believe is now 3 strong. I plan on reading the others because I liked the inclusion of so much about pottery and would like to find out what else is included in other books. The weakness of this book is the conclusion. It left me unsatisfied and seemed an easy way out for the author. The several short inclusions of the story from the viewpoint of the clay/pot made the flow of the narration uneven.The book includes a map of South Carolina with the cities mentioned in the book indicated on the map, a brief article on face jugs, and several photographs of face jugs as described in the story."
3,Could develop into a better series,Try though I would I just could not really care about any of the characters in this new series. The ending just seemed to fall into place and the sort of lurched from event to event. I will look for book #2 and hope for improvement.
4,Amusing and Thought-Provoking,"Chris Lynch packs a whallop in Slot Machine. Any young adult who has searched for his slot, his place to ""fit in"", will identify with Elvin Bishop. Readers will cry, moan, and eventually laugh with Elvin as he suffers through defeat, rejection, and then triumph. Lynch manages to sum up many readers' entire adolescence in three weeks of an action-packed, bully-infested, humiliation-filled summer camp. And yet our hero, Elvin Bishop, emerges stronger than he went in. He is secure in his knowledge of who he is, even as he watches his two best friends lose a bit of their perfection. Even though this tale is a bit tall, Lynch's writing contains realistic dialogue and character traits that young adults will identify with. Slot Machine is the epitomy of ""coming of age"" books, leaving readers a little more secure in the knowledge of who they might become."
3,ward is a playa,this book was fairly decent book. it was about sports with a little bit of comedy. a guy trys to play all different kinds of sports and gets thrown around and made fun of. he tries hard cause he wants to be like his friends. he is always getting hurt.there was some bad things about the book i didnt like. for one its to long. its also not as funny as it sounds like it would be. it wasn't a bad book though. it was confusing how one day he was doing one sport and all of a sudden the next day he was doing another. I would recommend this book to likes sports and a little bit of comedy.
1,not item pictured,"i ordered these because they were the flat clamp kind, as opposed to standard nipple clamps such as these: [...]instead, i got exactly what i already have and did not want, standard nipple clampswill never ever ever order from this merchant again"
1,TDi-on a 411,"This is purely a waste of money, their first album is a classic, their voice combinations are a masterpiece. These fellows must regroup if they wanna make it in this business. I still rate the first album ""prove my love"" the best ever by u-mynd."
5,PRIME TIME CLOSET,"A summary from the book's author:The Prime Time Closet takes an informative and entertaining look at the history of homosexuality on television. It examines howTV has treated the subject of homosexuality and represented gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender characters on medical dramas,police and detective shows, legal dramas, prime time and daytime soaps, teen dramas, made-for-TV movies, mini-series, and situation comedies. The book contains an appendix listing gay-themed episodes and characters from the mid-1950's through the present day."
1,Not good,"I bought this a couple of months ago for a project I'm working on at the advice of a store employee/expert saying it was their ""best seller"". It was worse in terms of clarity, focus, and chromatic aberrations than a $60 Barska Colorado scope I bought on sale, so I returned it. I don't understand how Vortex can (try to) sell this for over $300."
2,Confusing Book,"I had high hopes for gaining some clear techniques on time management from this book. However, I found it extremely confusing once I got to the Time Mapping section. The segments (activities, goals) melded into each other and I found Morgenstern's explanations less than clear as to what exactly to do. I consider myself fairly intelligent but she lost me.I did find value in identifying major life categories and big picture goal - but again - that entire section of the book that explained how to utilize that information was confusing. I went to her website to try to gain some insight and found going through message boards that it seemed as though many people who logged in were also still struggling.I have to say I'm disappointed as well as out $15.00."
4,Worthwhile but not life changing,"I bought the CD audiobook edition. It has the same info as the print edition to the best of my knowledge. I read her book, Organizing From the Inside Out, first. I am still reaping the benefits of a much better organized workspace several months later. The same ideas are retrofitted to deal with time management. I found the book worthwhile because it gives a fresh perspective on time management by borrowing ideas from organizing principles. But they are separate challenges. Some ideas from the book are likely to have a positive impact, but not the transformational impact that can be achieved from the other book. So, expect about as much from this as the other decent books on time management, no more, no less."
5,The author has taken the mystery out of time management,"From the onset, Time Management from the Inside Out identifies time as a tangible thing with boundaries and borders. Readers are introduced to the errors and psychological obstacles of time management, and then provided with the tools for effectively managing the hours in their day.Defining time as an a mathematical equation, Ms. Morgenstern states the problem and then provides the solution using her 5-step SPACE system of organizing. As she explains in her introduction, ""each day is simply a container, a storage unit that has a definite capacity you can reach"".The author has taken the mystery out of time management, giving us the tools we need to effectively overcome our procrastination, perfectionism, and the inability to delegate. Don't put off getting organized another day!"
2,Someone should have managed to find time to check for typos,"This is not a book I would typically purchase. But I was on a ""get organized"" kick when I stumbled across the book at a thrift store for less than a dollar and figured ""what the heck"".Within the first few pages I noticed a number of typographical errors. In this technology laden age there is simply no excuse for a book to go to press with typos. It conveys a lack of attention to detail and focus that does not speak well of the author or the publishing house.I found it hard to keep reading after finding the errors but I muddled through. I must say there is NOTHING remarkable in this book. Unless the reader it totally disorganized and unfocused I can't see anyone benefiting much from its reading.Bottom line, avoid buying this book and instead spend the money on a cute notebook, head to your local coffee house and spend some time thinking introspectively about your own personal obstacles to organization."
4,To Heal A Nation,I have seen this movie in the past. I presented it for viewing at the reunion of the OV-1 Mohawk Association when we met in Washington D.C. in September of 2004. I had misplaced my copy and needed to get a replacement. This fills the bill for me.Thank you
1,utterly pretentious,"Brevity is the essence of wit. How true. Metzinger's book shows just how true this adage is.""This book was written for readers"" Metzinger imperiously informs us at the outset. He should have qualified this phrase by referring to ""readers of drivel,"" and not otherwise intelligent and observant people.This book is ineffably BORING. Don't look for the clarity of Doidge or Gladwell here, boy. You ain't gonna find it. And to add insult to injury, Metzinger trots out non-existent words like ""processuality"" (p. 23) and phrases like ""not approaching syntacticity"" (p. 32). OMG. You've got to be kidding me! If God changed his mind and decided to flood the earth once more, I'd go find this book, cuz it would still be dry.And I'd like to know how I can get my money back for my 700 pages of nonsense. I tell ya: if the price of horse manure ever goes up, this book will be worth a fortune."
1,DANGEROUS!!!,"Don't buy this can opener! Because it cuts below the crimp, the entire rim of the can is a knife edge. And because it cuts low, liquids can spill.True safety openers cut on the side, but in the middle of the crimp ring.This opener manages to be both messy and DANGEROUS!"
1,Worst can opener on the market,"I purchased this can opener hoping it would open cans easily and leave a smooth edge. It does neither, now I can't even get it to work period. I've only had this opener for a month or so and now I will throw it in the trash. Absolutely a bad design. If you could adjust the position of the cutter blade up or down on the can might have helped but overall just doesn't seem to be tough enough to open cans reliably."
1,RIP-OFF,"This item not only ""DID NOT WORK"" It was ""USED and DAMAGED"". I will be reporting this Company to Amazon."
4,can openter,This is exactly as stated in descrption of item. It is easy to store and doesn't take up much space. I would recommend this to anyone.
1,useless product with no company support,"I bought 2 of these. They worked for the first few tins and then pooped out on me. I have tried all of the ""fixes"" and none work."
1,Don't waste your money!,It doesn't work and will not open cans! Very poor product! And I bought two of them! Uses up batteries by not opening cans and is noisy too!
2,not the same as the original,"The first one that I had for years worked great all the time, but then as I said years later it got stuck on a can and that was it. So, I was very happy when I saw this one, but it was not the same. First of all it doesn't go all the way around the can and you have to pry the lid open. Also, just to get it to that point you have to keep pressing the button. Strange that it did not have the logo on the outside. I feel like I just threw that money away. Totally disappointed especially since I wasted my hard earned money."
1,one touch can opener,I do not find this product easy to use it makes a terrible sound when using it I would never buy it again
3,Problems opening cans.,Sometimes the opener gear wants to climb up out of the top of the can rim and sometimes we have to let it go around twice to get it to cut through the lid.
1,i really wouldn't bother with this piece of junk...,"...mine stopped working on its second use- halfway thru! (Which meant i had to turn off dinner & run to the store for a replacement tin of tomatoes, grrr.) I bought it because i have a problem with my hand, but even an able-handed person cannot follow thru the troubleshooting instructions: it's physically impossible to insert a screwdriver as shown, or @ least it was in my case. When i called the number on the device i encountered _the_ worst customer service _ever_ (which is saying a lot!).Don't waste your money; i'd give this zero stars if it was possible!"
1,Useless,This can opener worked once and never again. Even with brand new batteries the can opener did not have enogh strength to open a can after the first time. Don't waste your money.
4,ingenious but some tricks you need to know,"This product is great because it removes the lid of a can without leaving sharp edges, it runs hands-free (as advertised), and it magnetically picks up the lid so it doesn't fall in.The downsides are that it sounds like it's dying when it runs (the little motor just sounds pathetic), it's a little hard to use at first (the trick is to just press it on the can until it engages and then let it go and don't stop it until it shuts off), and if the rim of the can is too fat, then it can't open it (which happens about 10% of the time)."
1,Junk,"Don't waste your money. Bought 3, one for myself, 2 for Christmas gifts. None work as advertised. Sharp edges, eats batteries. A fresh set of batteries may open one can if you're lucky."
1,One touch? try don't work and get stuck,I don't know if I got a bad one or what but when I tried this gadget it didn't work and never has. I've had it for months now and it still doesn't do what it promises. Mine rode about a inch around the can and then stopped and when it stops it's locked onto the can and won't come off. I spent forty minutes trying to get it off of the can. When I received it I was sick and my young son took it out of it's shipping package and threw away the paper work so I was unable to send it back so now I'm stuck with this useless junk. And yes I did put fresh batteries in it.
1,ONE TOUCH NIGHTMARE !,"This product does what no other product can claim to do, and that is to manage to do the complete opposite of everything they say that it will do.They say that it eliminates the sharp edge on the lid but it creates an even sharper edge on the can itself.They say one touch when it can take two or more before the thing gets rolling.They say that it is quick and easy but the opener takes FOREVER!!!! to circle the can.They say that if the opener gets stuck on the can it is a snap to remove it when the truth is that it is extremely difficult to remove this thing from its clutch on the can. That face gripping creature from the ALIEN movies would be easier to remove than this piece of junk.Please listen to these negative comments, they are completely truthful and accurate."
1,It failed.,It failed. After a few cans it just stopped. It is not the battery because I can manually make the motor turn but no more cans. Perhaps if I can reach customer service they can replace it.
3,"Handy, but not very powerful","I received the One-Touch a couple months ago and was pretty amused with it in the beginning. I opened a lot of cans for fun! It takes a little longer to open a can than an electronic can opener and it sounds like the batteries are going to die before it finishes opening. But, eventually it makes its way around the can and the lid lifts right off.Now, I'm finding more and more cans have the ""self-open"" tabs, so I don't use it as much as I thought I would. It's nice to have on hand and it is a small size that fits in a drawer."
1,Can Eater,"I did not like the way this can opener ripped off the entire top of the can. I was unable to drain the water from my tuna can and it was very messy unfortunately. I liked the extra freebie plastic/rubber hand-held opener. If I could just buy that, I'd use that. If you buy this opener, just know it will cut the can from the outside and not the inside of the top of the can."
5,Best can opener I've ever had,"I've had this can opener for over a year and have never changed the batteries. It works perfectly every time I use it. I don't understand the negative reviews; maybe I was just lucky enough to get a really good one and they got a dud. In any case, I love mine."
1,poor operation,"The first can opener I received did not work at all. I returned it and received a replacement. The replacement works, but very poorly. It does not open the can all the way around and often stops half way around."
1,Junk and more junk,I agree with everyone else who thinks its crap. I couldn't even get a single can to open with it. It would just bite down and grab the can only once puncturing it. Then it wouldn't let go. Not only is the machine junk but now it ruined a perfectly good can as well. Get ANYTHING else!
1,A waste of money,Seems like a good idea and it worked fine for about a week. Then I guess the battery power got too low and it stopped half way around a small can and was almost impossible to get off the can. It has never worked again and I threw it in the trash this morning. Don't waste your money!!
2,Save your money,"The can has to be 100% dent free for this to work. If you have even a tiny imperfection in the shape of the can, this thing won't open your product. A great idea, but this needed a little more refinement.Paper weight in my mind"
1,Listen to these negative reviews for your own good!,"Like the others, let me tell you that my One Touch Can Opener is taking up space in the local landfill. After having the batteries run out about 1"" around the can, I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS to release the blade. The teensy phillips screw is too close to the side of the can to get a teensy phillips screwdriver straight on -- nevermind being able to TURN it! After stripping the slots attempting to loosen the screw, I had to twist and wrench my coffee can free of the can opener. It went directly into the trash still holding bits of the can in its evil jaws! Don't waste your money. A clever idea but very poorly designed. Somebody, build a better one!"
2,Worked great...then it stopped!,"I got this last year for my mom for Christmas since she has arthritis in her hands and has trouble opening cans. It worked great and she loved it...for about a month. After a month is just stopped working. I wish I had trusted the other reviewers that said it breaks easily. If you want a great product that will only work for about a month, this is your product. I would strongly suggest looking into other products that will last longer!"
3,works while it works,When it works--it is great! My first one worked very well for about 1 1/2 years. The second one worked only until I changed batters--never worked again.It is agreat idea/concept that needs improvement
1,very dissappointed,it did not work when i received it . a small metal clip was lose in the package when i opened it
1,Planned Obsolescence,"I've owned TWO of these items and will not make that mistake a third time. Each time, the device worked fine for about 5-6 months and then just stopped functioning. I installed new batteries and that did no good, so it is a defect in the can opener itself.How do I get my money back from Amazon.com?"
3,Nothing is perfect,"My brother had one of these and I just had to have one. It worked so well for about one year, but then the battery went out while I was opening a can. I almost never got it off. I almost cut my fingers, and I did tear up the can. That is my only problem with it. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
2,ran out of battery while opening can - now can't take it off can,"I got this elsewhere for $9.99, and I was happy with it for the first few times that I used it. It worked well, cut the lid off without sharp edges. This time, it ran out of battery power halfway through and now I can't get it off the can. I can't reverse it because I have no power. I can't change batteries because the battery cover is the whole length of the opener, and you can't open it because it's stuck to the can. I finally threw both away. (it was only $9.99 , and so I had gotten 2 now I will check the battery level EVERY time before I use it. What a pain) Watch out. I think I got 3 or 4 uses out of the first one. I would be more upset if it had cost me more. Amazon prices are usually pretty competitive. I'm not sure why its so much.. then again prices change on Amazon all the time in case you guys haven't noticed (sometimes during the same day)"
4,Hands free can opener,"This is wonderful, it moves around the can on it's own and leaves the top and rim without a sharp edge. Because of this it does leave the can more flexible."
3,Worth a Try,"From reading other reviews, my guess is the main problem is inconsistant quality from unit to unit.My experience has been mainly positive. After going through what seemed like a dozen convential can openers, I chose this one, on a whim. I works as advertised, but mine has 3 flaws:1. It won't open small cans, such as tuna or tomato paste. Attempting to open these will only run the batteries down.2. The battery life is shorter than I would like, but nothing like some reviews I've read here.3. The battery compartment is hard to open.Other than those 3 issues, I'm happy with my opener."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this thinking it would be a helpful can opener and easy to use. After the first can it died 1/2 way through with good batteries. I then tried a lighter weight can with another set of ""new"" batteries. After what seemed a lifetime, the can was open. I threw this piece of junk in the trash! Would rather use a pocket knife. I wouldn't buy it!"
3,Review - One Touch Can Opener,"It does open without having to crank or turn anything. However, it is very wobbly as it turns, does not pick up the top of the can with the magnet, as it states in ads and I think the most dangerous feature is after the lid is removed, the sides of the can are extremely sharp. I certainly would never allow a child to use it. But as someone with arthritic wrists, I'll use it and just be very careful when I pick up the can to rinse for recycling."
4,Enna Burning,THe product was as purchased and in good condition.THe timing sucked because I paid extra for shipping faster and it still did not arrive on time.
5,One of the best,"I have used at least a dozen can openers in my life. This is the easist and most thorough in opening a can. I gave it as a gift to my neighbor, and she told me it broke after about a year. I reported this to the Co. on the web site. They said they ordinarly didn't cover this on their 30 day warrenty, but because of the circumstances they would send another one. Which they did. My neighbor was thrilled. I had ""repaired"" her old one. She was not letting it turn itself off after finishing cutting through the lid. I showed her how to reset it from underneath, and complete its cycle. No problems now. I now have 2 openers, both over a year old. They work everytime following the explicit directions."
3,One Touch Can Opener,"Only works part of the time. No power (just quits) to open some cans. ""Eats"" batteries like kids eat candy. This would be a handy dandy item if it had the power to open a can without just ""powering"" out. It also is very selective in the cans it likes (if it doesn't like the can, it will not work). The reverse switch to remove it from a can it doesn't like is like a real joke in the time it takes to work and then it reverses back and you have to start over again."
1,Total Failure,"My 85 year old mother saw this on TV and thought it would make the chore of opening cans easier for her. I order one for her and it arrived in just a couple days. We installed fresh batteries and tried it on a regular can of fruit. It only made it about 2/3 of the way around the can and stopped. We followed the included instructions and used the reset button multiple times and tried the other procedure listed in the instructions for removing an opener with dead batteries. We tried for nearly 30 minutes to remove the opener with no success. Frustrated, I packed it up, still stuck on the can, and returned it."
1,Disappointed,"I had seen TV commercials for this and it looked so nifty so I order one for my 92 year old mother. It only made it about 1/4 of the way around the can when it jammed. I followed the included instructions and used the reset button multiple times. It still couldn't move on. With difficulty I was able to get it off of the can, using the reset button and another trick they described in the instructions. Then I realized that, if it had taken the lid off, it would have left sharp edges at the top of the can. I had mistakenly assumed it was like those safety can openers that cut through the lid from the side and leave no sharp edges. I would rather have the sharp edges on the lid as in old-fashioned products than at the top of the can, that is if it worked. Needless to say, I returned it."
1,Battery eater!!,"I'd give this 0 stars if I could. I bought mine from QVC. It eats batteries. It opened 3 cans on a fresh set of batteries, then died while opening a can. I had to pry it off. I have arthritis so I thought this would be a godsend. Thank Gawd QVC took it back after 2 months.HORRIBLE, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,"Good idea, bad design","I loved this can opener at first. It was, and still is, nice to press a button and it opens. The biggest pro is that the lid isn't sharp like with the regular can openers. Although the top can edge is a bit sharper than with a regular can opener. - My fiancee cut his hand scoopping out wet dog food. As others say, it eats battery power fast. -For me, I might open 8 cans (max) on one set of batteries. And I don't notice any slowing down, it just dies. Everytime the battery has died while cutting open a can. The first time mine ran out of batteries, I broke the can opener prying it off the can. I thought it was a fluke, so I bought another one. Batteries still die in the middle of opening a can. I'm just more careful prying it off now. It's fun at first. But I don't understand why it goes through so many batteries so fast. If I knew that, I wouldn't have purchased. Also, it is loud."
1,one touch can opener HALTS,"I was pleased with this can opener for a while...maybe 2 months..used it maybe 5 times a week. There was no indication that the batteries were failing. The other night I started to open a can, the opener worked for about 1 inch, then suddenly STOPPED...I cannot release it to see if a battery change will work. The opener is holding onto the can with the perseverance of an alligator. It looks like the only way I can release the contraption is to force it, thus breaking it. I shall return to the ""hand crank"" openers. The toll free number on the opener ( for help) is not useable in my area ( Springfield-Northampton Massachusetts).An email to address found on internet resulted in responder knowing nothing about item."
1,Not worth $20 should sell for $5,I brought this and it stop half way through opening one can. It was a pain to get off when that happen. I tried it again with rechargeable batteries and it seem to work OK. It seems to need a lot of power.It is not something I would ever buy again. I have an hand can opener that does the same thing safety cutting of lid that is better.
1,Extremely Poor Design,I bought one of these hoping for little and got less. Anyone who rates this item above a 1 star obviously has not had the batteries go dead yet. Once the batteries go dead you are faced with the option of holding a partially opened can above your head and turning a phillips head screw (you with arthritis forget that because it takes about 500 turns for an average size can!) or prying it off since the battery container is between the opener and the can. Unfortunately this opener only lasts for around three cans with fresh batteries. I threw my in the trash along with a partially opened can the second time the batteries died.
1,Wow it broke,It broke the first time I used it Ended up throwing it away. I decided to go back to the old fashion opener. This one would not turn or come off the lid
2,Mediocre knock-off,"Product works fairly well, but not perfectly; sometimes takes a while to start/finish. Packaging is clearly not the actual One Touch can opener, but a third-party knock off; I can't recommend this at a price so close to the actual product. Works kind of OK though. You probably should keep looking, potential buyer."
2,One touch can opener,"I already had a One Touch Can Opener that worked fine for several years. It suddenly stopped working. It would puncture the can but not cut around it. I ordered a new one upon trying it out, it did the same thing. It would not open the can. I sent it back and received a full credit for the purchase price and shipping. I hate that the product did not work, but appreciate the prompt credit."
2,Worked great...before it broke.,"I got this can opener for my grandmother who has trouble gripping things, so she can't open cans or jars. The first one I got her was broken right out of the box, so it went back. The second one opened about 5 or 6 cans before it froze on a half-opened can. Now it's stuck there, useless, even after a change of batteries."
2,Not as expected,"The item does not look the same as the one-touch I saw at my friends' house. It is not labeled one-touch, it is wider and lighter."
2,Beware! There are sharp edges on the One-Touch Can Opener,Beware! There are sharp edges. The product is easy to use except on small tomato paste cans but I don't know how they can get away with saying there are no sharp edges. I have cut myself so many times on the cans which are like razor blades. I am afraid someone is going to cut off a finger if they aren't careful. It's easy to cut yourself when you are trying to spoon out something from the can.
1,No good,Product did not work so good. Got hung on can and then battery went dead at first use. I returned for refund. Did not like it.
1,Terrible Product,I buy lots of the infomercial products and this is one of very few that doesn't operate properly. Trust me you will toss it in the trash!!
1,One big piece of crap,This think sucks. At first it was working. But once the batterie started to run low it got stuck on my can of tuna and i could not pulled it off. It cut deep thru the can. I threw it away along with the can of tuna still attached to it. In my experience with can openers the electronic ones tend to break easily it is better just to get a good quality manual can opener.
1,Equipment Coord.,"So far, we are not getting this item to work.....I am not sure it is good f/ an older person to operate....."
1,One Touch Can Opener,I tried 2 of these can openers and neither worked so I finally gave up. I had one I bought 2 years ago at a department store and that worked fine but it didn't come with the free jar opener. I wonder if they added the free opener because the quality of the product has declined. Too bad because I loved the first one I had.
1,one touch can opener,"The unit did not work. I threw it out. The seller did not want it back, but the seller was good enough to offer me a full refund."
2,Doesn't last!!!,This product doesn't last. I've had mine for 4 months and you can't do more than 1 can per episode. It stalls on large cans and has to be pulled off which is tough. It finally bit the bullet today. I don't recommend it.
5,AN EXCELLENT BUY,CAN OPENERI love this product. I have artheritis and it is hard to operate other can openers. This product allows anybody with a disability with hands to have freedom to open cans at no trouble at all. What a great invention.I recommend this especially to senior citizens.
2,can't remove can opener from can when battery dies!,I bought this can opener because it seemed like a terrific idea for us seniors. It worked well for two months until today. We tried to open a 12 oz. can of tuna and it died. we pressed the the small black button on the underside and it still didn't help. I now am stuck with a tuna can that I had to finish opening with our back-up manual opener and removed tuna by hand. Tried to remove can from the dead one touch and cut my hand in 2 places(so much for no sharp edges). Now we are stuck with this can which is stuck to the one touch proving I got stuck when I bought the darn thing!
5,Big or little doesn't matter,"This is the best, and easiest to use, can opener on the market today. On testing it for a few days I found the no can is too big or too little for this little ""giant"". This product exceeds the cost! It also exceeded my expectations."
1,One Touch Can Opener,"I thought this was the original One Touch that I bought when it first came out. When receiving this product, I have a lot of noise coming out when it finally opens the cans. It also takes three tries just to open the can. I don't want this product and I need a return label to send this product back. Will never buy this product from here again. I will try buying it from the store or go to the website to get from someone else."
1,Garbage,I gave this opener 1 star because there wasn't a 0 option. Total waste of money. Worked great for about 10 cans. It came to a griding halt stuck on the can. The instructions tell you to turn the screw to get it off your can. Hogwash. Stupid soft plastic screw just crumbled. Finally pried the thing off the can which wasn't easy and tossed it in the trash.
1,Awful product,"It really is a shame that you can't give 0 stars for an item. My mother bought this for me for Christmas. The day we opened it, the second we put the batteries in, the thing's blade started turning and WOULD NOT STOP until we yanked out the batteries. It was fine when we put them back in later, but when I went to use it today, it punctured a hole in the side of my can of beans, dripping baked bean juice all down the side of the can, and then refused to move at all. Not only am I irritated that my mother wasted her money on this piece of junk (I hope she can return it somewhere), but I'm still hungry, and my can of tasty beans has been wasted. If my mother can't return this waste of money, I'll gladly throw it away with less remorse than I had when I threw away my punctured 59 cent can of beans."
2,yes sharp edges,"Be aware that this can opener cuts the lids off cans below the ridge creating 2 sharp edges...on the lid and on the can itself. Otherwise, it is a good concept for anyone who may have difficulty in using manual can openers or for those who need the counter space."
1,Garbage can opener,Just bought this and it does not take lid off all the way. Lids frequently get stuck on opener and must be pried off.Do not waste your monry on this.Also customer service number gets you talking to someone near Tora Bora.
1,Waste of Money!!!,"I purchased the One Touch Opener from it's website & what I've noticed when I was trying to use it, is that it doesn't cut cans like shown. The motor inside of it actually stops after one second at the most & doesn't cut around the can. The motor doesn't work at all now! Also,The stall release screw on the bottom of the One Touch Opener is made of cheap plastic, therefore the stall release screw chips easily when adjustment is made by using a phillips screw driver as the instructions say to do so. Anyway, I'm safely better off using my regular can opener for now since it works better than the One Touch Opener."
1,Isn't worth the can of beans it couldn't open,"This thing sucks. It attached itself to our can with Super Glue-like grip and wouldn't let go. This did not mean, however, that it resulted in the can opening. Tried on multiple sizes and can shapes - it especially sucks on large cans. I cannot believe that this is a Top 500 product in Amazon kitchenwares."
2,Arrived on time but item is weak,"The item was delivered on time and in good condition so no complaints about the vendor, But this is the 3rd one touch can opener we have had, and each one seems to be weaker and slower than the last. Would not buy again"
4,Open cans safely and with almost no effort.,I had a bad wrist and this thing worked great for years. Easy to clean recommend Alkaline batteries. Weak batteries could jam it.
4,ONE TOUCH CAN OPENER GOOD,"THIS IS A GOOD PRODUCT AS LONG AS YOU USE GOOD BATTERIES (ENERGIZER MAX, DURACELL ECT), YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. I HAD ONE FOR 2 YEARS USING IT ALMOST DAILY. IT WILL NOT OPERATE PROPERLY WITH CHEAP BATTERIES."
1,one touch can opener,what a waste of money - it sucks. I'd have been better off flushing the money down the toilet.
2,it was awesome WHILE IT LASTED,"this opener worked wonderfully. i opened several cans before the batteries ran out. i changed the batteries....and it never worked again. it would start, quit, and get stuck on the can. it finally got so stuck, we had to forcefully pry it off a can of beans. after that, it was completely dead. i'd rather go buy a 5 dollar can opener at Wmart. it was awesome while it lasted"
1,Fraud,"It's junk. Bought one .. opened 15 cans and it quit. I agree with all the other 9 out of 13 reviews, it powered out and no matter which brand of battery you put in it, it won't start up again. I was stupid enough to buy a second one thinking it might be my fault. Got the same result. At $20.00 apiece, the Better Business Bureau should shut this company down."
2,Worried about its safety,"I purchased this can opener recently and noticed that it left the inside of the can INCREDIBLY sharp! It boasts no sharp edges, but I have to say that I am really worried about it. I even allowed my stepson to use the can opener thinking that it was perfectly safe. Luckily, I got the lid off before he did! I am not sure if other people have had this issue. I searched on Google and found a site with a report stating that the inside of the cans have the same sharpness as a surgical knife!!! YIKES! I would not recommend this product...unless you are INCREDIBLY careful!"
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!,This is the biggest piece of junk! Never worked. Does even have the product name on it. Must be a fake. I've owned one before and this is nothing like older versions. The item came with an internal wire pinched in the seam of the opener and looks like it had already been repaired once. It's about half the weight of the original. BUYER BEWARE! Your problem if you don't listen. Made the mistake of not testing in the first 30 days and can't return it now.
1,Form over Function,My wife's hand strength is poor-so we tried this ---her hand strength was good enough to throw it away when it stopped and jammed on each can she tried.
1,"terrible product, They changed it from the original","My wife and I loved the original one touch, every 2-3 years we would need to order a new one as we would wear them out... Thats fine, nothing lasts forever. My last purchase was a mess though. To get free shipping, I bought 2 one touch can openers, figuring I would save the second for when we wore out the first. The first one we opened didnt work at all, the motor would not turn, we returned that and opened the second one. The second opened motor turned, but it would not grip the can to sink the blade into the can side. Total garbage. It feels lighter than the original, and the black button did NOT have the imprint on it. We're back to the manual opener."
3,one touch can opener,"Worked great until recently, mine requires new batteries every time you use it. For example, use it once, next time, new batteries are required. Loved it for a while, maybe I just got a defective one."
4,Bought as a gift,"For my boyfriend.It opens cans as advertised. But, it does it excruciatingly slow.However, one upside that has not been mentioned:This can opener is quite a bit heavier than a regular can opener. So, if you are suddenly attacked in your kitchen, it would make a very handy last second weapon.Also, if you are in the middle of opening a can, this opener will NOT let go. This would help you in your defense immensely because you would be smacking your attacker across the head not only with the heavy can opener, but also with a can attached.So, buy it for your kitchen, to open your cans, and get the self defense benefit, too."
5,OneTouch can opener,"This is one of those invention that come along that is better. If you have any hand diseases you can still open cans. You just set it on top and push the button and the opener does the rest. Thank You, C.S."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this product because I thought it will be easier than manual can opener. I spent $20.00 for a product that died from the beginning and since it was on sale I couldn't return it. I had to fight and practical break it to get the lid off the can opener. Save your money invest in a good can opener.
1,This opener is a piece of junk,"Don't buy it is about all I have got to say for this piece of junk. if there had been one minus star, that is where I would rate this thing.Mine went in the trash yesterday, and am now here looking for something that hopefully works."
5,This actually works!,"I purchased this can opener for my mother who is 87 and has trouble operating conventional can openers. I thought for sure it would turn out that it wouldn't work as easily as shown on the tv ads, and I have to admit I was hesitant about paying so much for an item that was going to maybe just end up in a drawer. Three days after I placed my order the can opener arrived. I couldn't wait to give it a try! And.... bingo...it worked just like on the tv ad! I was amazed how simple it was, just place it on the can lid and push the button. It was just that simple. I think this is the first ""as advertised on tv"" item that I have ever bought that actually works the same as shown on the tv hype advertisement. My mom loves it! So far, so good!"
1,It takes two,"It took me two of these for me to wonder why I ever spent the money. I threw them both in the trash. The first one jammed and I couldn't get the lid off, and the second one never worked right either. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I purchased this off of QVC and yes it will take the lid off of the can, but very slowly and then the BIG problem was that I could NOT get the lid off of the can opener itself! My Husband had to take it off by grasping the lid with pliers! It did that three times and I said that is it,it is going back to QVC for a refund! If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! Don't waste your money!"
1,"How do you define ""open""...","If you define it as poking a slot around 1/3 of the can and then getting stuck in the middle, then this works great. Otherwise, forget it.I got about two cans actually open before it stopped working. Seems like it's low on batteries. Let's see, two fresh alkalines / 2 cans opened = 1 battery used per can. If you don't think that's a great deal, this pile of junk is not for you. Oh, and I am not talking about the wholesale sized coffee can with a 12"" diameter lid, either, these were little tiny baby sized tuna cans.You'd be better off paying some kid $20 to stomp on your foot with baseball cleats. IT WOULD BE THAT MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE."
1,Complete piece of junk,"Used it brand new, out of the box, with new batteries, and it struggled to make it around the can. It usually stops half way around, and several times it got jammed and was hard to remove. Also, the button jams, and renders it useless.Very poor product, and if it was free, that would be too much. Save your money."
2,Does not work as advertised,"The One Touch Can Opener that we bought opened four cans, but when opening the fifth can, it had barely started and then stopped. The batteries were fresh when first installed. Apparently, the batteries or something else failed as the can opener would not continue to operate and was impossible to remove from the can. As far as I can tell, there is no release mechanism to disengage the device once it has stopped while partially opening a can.I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.Dickson G. Pratt"
4,Cool CD,"Aside from the fact that the guitar player is so fine, I like the music and the words. I heard a song from the CD on the radio in New Jersey and ran right out and purchased it and it was worth every cent!"
5,Lite The Nite Baby!,"This band Nite Lite carries the torch for real rock. Finally; a guitar solo during a break in a song that doesn't bluff like ""The Edge"" sort of garbage that fakes it's way through a solo. This guy Ed Torres plays the most incredible guitar I ever heard. Real notes that go somewhere with a purpose and the most intense emotion! The songs are well written compositions. It's good to know that there are still musicians around that can play and still not leave the rock genre. It would be a crime if this band didn't make it big. Buy this Now!"
5,Hypnotizing sad and beautiful,"The best review of Hannah Fury's work is one of her own lyrics. ""I'll make the strychnine taste like raspberry tea"". Her voice has a liquid sweetness which contrasts with the very sad mournful lyrics beautfully. Her personality and passion shines through in every song. Each song is it's own little story. The mournful anguished lyrics and sparse piano arrangements come though as genuine and not overdone. One of the best of the hundreds of albums I own. Highly reccomended."
3,Grows old after a while,"When I first heard Hannah Fury's ""the thing that feels"" I was immediately drawn to the haunting melodies and Tori-like piano playing. I bought the CD but have just not been satisfied since. After my initial listen, the songs lost their appeal and became monotonous and depressing. And I usually like depressing music! One song that did stay with me after I'd stopped listening was ""meathook"". That piece does have beautiful phrasing and Hannah's voice is etheral sounding and almost angelic. On the whole though, the CD just got to be too much. If you'd still like to purchase ""The thing that feels"" get it from cdbaby.com. They ship in 24 hrs and have not just this Cd, but her two singles as well."
5,the tragic encounter of two worlds beautifully conveyed,This book is a gem. The sad results of the encounter of the Spanish with the indiginous population of the Caribbean Islands is presented objectively and the few accounts of the Tiano Peoples' own words are effectively used to hint at who these early victims of European expansion really were. The use of modern photos and historic illustrations opens up the real lost world where these events unfolded and every illustration adds to and interacts with the text. The result is both a good read and a rigerous scholarly introduction to the foundations of the American experiance. This is the first work of its kind that interperts the historic documents as understood by an island inhabitant who understands details the first explorer encountered from personal experiance.
3,I gave it a 3 because I loved it but hate the author chose it to be a stand alone,"I love this book but the author chose it to be a stand alone book while she left Elana, Liz and Michael and the potential for them over. This story and the left over characters deserve a story and a story that begs to be written. Unfortunately it's a stand alone, too bad."
1,Not for Me,"I'm sorry to be so critical but I reached a point where because of pages of boring repetition and no progress, I felt the title of the book was exactly what I would say to the author - ""Don't Say A Word"" , not another word. I stopped reading it,"
5,Great book!!,Loved the book from start to finish. I found it very easy to read. We read it for our book club.
2,Slow story. Unlikable characters.,"Don't Say A WordThis was a slow moving but interesing mystery story without any really likable characters. The same info was repeated several times. There were some twists and turns at the end but it took forever to get to them.It was hard for me to like the protagonists. I found them self centered and foolish. They were told repeatedly that they were putting their loved ones in mortal danger. But, they didn't care. They just kept seeking out more and more people to put in danger. When they were told they could be killed by professionals that killed before, they kept saying ""I can take care of myself."" He was a photographer and she a disc jockey. Julia was selfish in her relationship with her fiance. And Alex was cold hearted toward Julia. I didn't really like either of them.I think I am done with this author. This is the second book of her's that I have read that I didn't like the characters."
5,interesting read,Some reviewers thought the plot was trite. I was not expecting the twist Barbara Freethy took and thoroughly enjoyed it.
2,More than reader can swallow,"Barbara Freethy bit off more than this reader can swallow. Writing a dumbed down version of ""Russia House,"" ""Parent Trap,"" and Anastasia, the author actually has a great plot and story idea, but she didn't research, didn't build up enough detail and didn't enrich this with real characters. The plywood cutout characters failed to elicit any emotional attachment from me and the whodunnit aspect of the story was apparent from the beginning. I wanted to get lost in the prose and the story, but I couldn't suspend my disbelief. Such a good story idea. I miss Cold War stories and I wanted to love Julia as much as Hayley Mills (Parent Trap), but it was not to be."
2,long and drawn out story,"This is the second book i am reading by this author..the first was similar in that the characters hem and haw endlessly about their dilemma, agonizing about what to do..while others around them are resisting and trying to get them to stop making the decision to explore their issue, which, for the story to progress they eventually do....its torture to read..I just wish they would get on with it and something would happen. I regret that, based on the reviews I bought 4 of her books. 2 of which I will never read and wish I could return."
5,Amazing Book!!!!,Best book I'm read in a long time. I couldn't stop reading it once I started. I can wait to read more of Barbara Freethy books. Such a great author.
5,Gripping suspense!,"Julia DeMarco has suddenly discovered that everything she knows about herself may be a lie. Is her mother really her mother? And her sister?Along the way she also evaluates her engagement, her relationship with her family, and discovers several unknown relatives along with a new love interest.I discovered Barbara Freethy's books this weekend and I am hooked. Truly enjoyable, suspenseful books."
5,Couldn't put it down.,"Another great suspense novel from Barbara Freethy. It's got everything you're looking for in a summertime book - lots of intriguing characters and a plot that kept me guessing from the beginning. Just when I thought I had it figured out, the story took another twist and turn and I just couldn't imagine what would happen next. Looking for a great escape? This is the book for you."
5,Great book.,Good story line. Kept me interested to the point that I had a hard time putting it down. I will read additional books by this author.
5,Great Book.,"She writes the best books! I have read several Barbara Freethy books, and haven't found a single one I didn't like."
5,Loved this book!,I absolutely loved this book - I recently discovered Barbara Freethy and she's quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. I loved the characters and the storyline.Another great book! A+++
1,Annoying,OMG this book made want to give up on reading romantic suspense forever. I just kept feeling like giving Julia a tight slap and asking her to grow up. A person who doesn't care about anybody but herself is just not my idea of how a main character should be. I would strongly suggest people to keep away from this one.
2,Hmmm - sorry I wish I could love it,"Perhaps I've read too many romance novels and can't see the trees any more but I began this open eager to be happy again with romance but after two chapters I shut the book. The writer is excellent but it's the editors who are the problem, demanding their authors follow formulaic plots, not stretching out to something new. Ignore this review if you love most romances; you'll love this one - I've been tainted by Stieg Larsson who I could not put down, and Tami Hoag's last few books which were more suspense than romance. If you love typical romance books, you'll love this one."
2,Complete bore,"I quit readingDon't Say A Wordat 24%, deciding that there was nothing of interest in the book. Plot, characters, settings, writing style-- dull. If you decide to read it, good luck. For myself, I wish I had stopped sooner."
1,Horrible!,"After reading wonderful books like, ""What Alice Forgot"" and ""One Day"" this summer it is with much regret that I wasted my time on this vapid, predictable book. The dialog alone made me roll my eyes on several occasions. I beg you...don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,don't pay over $5 for cd,"Of the 12 songs on the cd, only 3 are worth listening to...Lord Do It, There Is No GReater Lover and Plenty Good Room. The overall quality of the cd is poor. I don't recommend purchasing this cd."
4,my latest must-read author,"i'm not sure why i ordered this book when i found it listed in my recommendations--guess i was desperate for a new author.well, i'm very glad i took the gamble in buying it--madelyn alt has a wonderful style, most of the characters are individual and well drawn (and i can't agree that the mother isn't awful when she finally appears--she's so controlling she can't even let her adult daughter peel vegetables as she pleases), and the mystery isn't bad for a first book.the main weakness is the amount of time spent creating the series situation. i expect that the second book will be much stronger as a mystery when the author concentrates on that aspect.and i will definitely be reading the second book--there's enough humor, interesting relationships and potential to make this a very entertaining series."
2,Disappointed,"I am only about half way through the book and am frankly a little bored. Not much has happened in the book. The murder has taken place and the key characters have been introduced, but nothing else interesting has happened. I had high hopes for the book. I love mysteries with amateur sleuths and I like paranormal books so I thought for sure that this would be a hit. If you want to read the book, get it from the library. Don't spend money on it until you have read the first few chapters.If you are looking for a good amateur sleuth/paranormal series try Victoria Laurie's Psychic Eye Mysteries. They are excellent."
2,Definetely trouble with magic,"I'm a big fan of paranormal mysteries and was very excited to see this one come out. Unfortunately, I was disappointed in this book. It has the elements to be a great read, but I found the character annoying. I understand that the character goes through a process of ""opening her mind"" to other possibilities, but the constant internal monologue to this topic detracted from the story line. And the fact that she lives in a small town with close-minded people... well I got that point on page 10, and don't need to be reminded of it on page 20, 30, 40, etc.I think there is great potential with this series, and hope that the author can work out some of the more distracting elements and focus on writing the story, rather than commenting about the character's situation."
3,Magick and Mahem,"I enjoyed reading this mystery, but it wasn't as good as many other mysteries I've read. I was a little disappointed. I did like the fact that it had a paranormal twist.My recommendations are to read Victoria Laurie's Psychic Eye series if you liked reading this book."
2,Frustrating,I agree with an earlier reviewer who said she was left feeling like we had to listen to the lead characters inner thoughts too often. It slowed down the book and was frankly boring. I also agree that the characters were one-dimensional and felt like cardboard.
3,The Trouble with MAGGIE!,"The premise of this book is better than the execution. The main character, Maggie, goes on and on in the early pages about how awful her mother is and then when the mother character is finally introduced she's not drawn in a way that compels the reader to agree with Maggie. Similarly, Maggie continually ""voices"" an unhappiness with her Catholic upbringing...I kept feeling like I was reading someone's therapy transcripts. I liked the second character, Felicity, a whole lot better than the main character, and I thought the murderer was really obvious much too soon in the story. All that being said, I'd read another book in this series, particularly if Maggie and Felicity pair up on ""cases""."
3,The Trouble with Magic,"I loved the book until the last few chapters. The killer was obvious, which is okay. But the main character is so incredibly clueless and DUMB about it! I almost threw the book down without reading the end, that's how irritated I was. I loved all the other characters, but the thick-headed narrator ruined the series for me."
2,The Trouble With ...,"First off, this is the most ""red state"" book I've ever read. From the narrator's carping about urban sprawl to her amused certainty that an abortion clinic could not be established in her small-minded community, well, it's just not my kind of thing. The paranormal aspect of the story is really just window dressing, and the mystery is thin. Not recommended to urban types, mystics, Buffy fans, or anyone looking for a good read."
1,Completely unbelievable,"The ""bond"" between Maggie and Felicity seemed very forced. Maggie was either whiny and depressed, or creepily attached. Their ""friendship"" progressed at a lightning fast pace (Maggie spent the night at Felicity's house after knowing her for a day and a half) and weirded me out."
2,disappointed,"I bought this book thinking it would be full of mystery and magic. I was disappointed in both accounts. The main character is slow to catch on and presents herself as rather weak. Honestly, I felt that the strongest character in the book was Christine (her car) which had a much larger role then was needed.This book was tiresome and I would not recommend it to others. If you want a fun book with good characters and great magic, try Enchanted Inc. and leave Trouble alone."
3,slow and witchy,"This is the first book I've read by this author. It was a slow read, not enough excitement or action to keep you wanting to turn the page for the murder/mystery part. I have a thing about finishing a book no matter what so I kept reading it. If I didn't then I wouldn't be able to tell someone else about the good and the bad. However I was happy to see the author giving authentic explanation on Wicca and the practicing of the craft. She painted a lovely picture of an older woman who is a practicing witch. It lets the average person know a little about the Wicca topic but it's not all encompassing. You get to learn along side of the main character who is a little more then nervous about meeting the older woman so if you have reservations it's ok so does she your not alone. I would say that this book is a good read for any reader wanting to know a little bit about witch craft and who likes there mysteries a little light. I'm used to reading books with a bit more action and /or violence."
3,It's OK,"For a light-cozy mystery, it was OK. I was just looking for something a little deeper ... Cute!"
4,Reading with Tequila,"I loved the mystery and the magic aspects of this book. Overall, it was a good, quick read. I will be reading more of the series. Having said that, one problem, for me at least, was that being it was the first in a series, it gave a lot of background information. Normally, that would be fine but in this case it was background information on witchcraft. Most people interested in a book of this kind would probably know this information already and it kind of slowed down the pace of the book. Another problem, this time completely personal, was that the book has ghosts/spirits. I'm not a huge fan of haunting stories."
2,Don't waste your time,"Without getting into the storyline, this book felt like a total chore to finish. I picked it up based on the many positive amazon reviews, but this time it was a miss. Even an easy read has character developement, but I know no more now that the book is over than I did at the start. Time is precious, read something else!"
5,Great series beginner,Wow I bought this book just on a hunch and I'm so glad I did. I can't wait to read the rest the rest of the series. the characters are charming and seem like friends you wish you had.
5,magical blend,"I loved this start of a new cozy mystery series by Madelyn Alt. She writes a magical light mystery story that is just enchanting to read, and leaves one wanting more. Can't wait to read more of her work. Well done."
1,Couldn't get pass page 40,I found this book annoying. The plot line was gimmicky and I found main character unsympathetic and whiny. A waste of money.
3,"cute, but not that engaging",This was pretty cute but really not all that engaging. I didn't have as much fun as I had hoped I would. Something quick to read while waiting on the next episode of your fav. series. I don't think I will continue this one.
4,Good light reading,"Bored with her office job, Maggie decides to take a chance on working in the retail industry for a self-described witch. Things get really interesting when the witch is accused of murdering her sister. Lots of fun Magnum PI references, possessed Volkswagon bugs, and talking burial urns. Good characters with interesting quirks, light romantic moments."
4,Good introduction for non-science types,"A fine and clear review of the development of cosmological theory from Ptolemy to the present, definitely written for the curious non-scientist.Seife has a good feeling for how strange the universe is, and for how unsettling it can be to contemplate it. He takes your hand and leads you through the stories of discovery with respect, but assuming you know little to nothing about the subject.I had trouble putting it down."
3,satisfactory overview,"This book provides a satisfactory overview of the history and current state of cosmology. Unfortunately, the book describes Copernicus as wasting many years trying to explain the radiuses of the planetary orbits in terms of the five Platonic solids, when in fact it was Kepler who was obsessed with this idea. The majority of popular books devoting space to the history of astronomy mention this, with most also including a picture of Kepler's model, thus it is certainly not an obscure fact. This error made me wonder whether the book was reviewed by anyone knowledgeable prior to publication. I was disappointed to see such a major error in the book as it made me wonder what other errors might be lurking in the text. It definitely showed that the author was not as familiar with the material as he should have been."
1,"AN ""ABSOLUTE"" ""BEGINNING"" IS IMPOSSIBLE!","-THERE 'NEVER' WAS NOTHING!-Anyone claiming to write a book describing a possible 'origin' or ""Beginning"" to our ""UNIVERSE""-who ignores and fails to mention the word ""INFINITY"" is hopelessly 'over his head'-and should go back to playing ""Tiddlywinks""!-And, to believe anyone can discover a so-called ""Black"" Hole"" when looking at 'Blackness' is to-believe that ""Mickey Mouse"" can 'really' talk! Or, that ""Apollo"" 'really' put ""a man on the MOON""!-FAIRY-TALES!-Jocta Anoracle-"
2,Tiny!,"I bought this for my niece for her first birthday. When it arrived I was disappointed, it is really small, about the size of my hand."
2,Way too small,My am a bit dissapointed in this purse. It is very small and my daughter can't even get the strap over her wrist. It is was too small. She likes playing with the items inside but not the purse.
4,Daughter likes it,"9m girl old likes it. My 18m boy old loves the plush cell phone. Constantly takes it from the 9m old girl and walks around going ""Hai! Hai!"""
5,First Birthday Present,My first Purse is adorable. I bought it for my niece's first birthday. she especially loves the cell phone. At this age everything is going in her mouth and with this purse set she can put anyof it in her mouth to teeth on. I highly recommend it.
5,cute and what I expected,Thought this was very cute and was just as it was described. My daughter gets compliments on it when we go out.
3,"Cute purse but really, really tiny","I bought this purse for my 22 mo old granddaughter as one of her Xmas presents. It is cute and I'm sure she'll like it and the cell phone, however, because it's so tiny I decided to use it as a stocking stuffer rather than wrap it as an individual gift. I was slightly disappointed for that reason. Entirely too small! I also envision the tiny compact and change purse getting lost in the house or car because they are so miniature."
3,Cute Purse.. but REALLY small for the price,"The purse is adorable, but would better suit the price tag if it was larger. It is really REALLY tiny! I bought two of them for birthday presents, and when they came in, I immediately thought that I would have to buy something else to go with them b/c they are so tiny. I wouldnt recommend buying as a gift if it is the only thing you are giving."
5,cute baby purse,"This was soooo cute!! Bought it for my baby niece. Her mommy is the biggest fashionista, so thought it would be fitting to have her little one starting out right. It is perfect, so much so, that I will have to keep it away from my little girl who will want it for herself. Looks like a good durable toy ready to be drooled and teethed upon!"
2,Way too much money for this tiny thing,"I didn't expect Gucci, nor did I expect a bird size purse with mosquito size items. The price, $22 for this, is absolutely ridiculous."
2,Products great - price is not.,"I was excited when I received this kit because I love sushi and have been looking for a way to make it at home. However, I must say that I was disappointed by and large with what I actually got considering the price that I paid. The products themselves are great but I don't notice a big difference at all from the items available at my local asian grocery store. I purchased the same grade of items as well as all the ingredients necessary to make sushi that were not included (such as rice, vegetables, seafood, etc) for less money than it cost for just this kit. I would not recomment purchasing it - instead, do your homework and find a local asian grocery store - the quality is the same but the price is much more palatable!"
5,Good starter set,"Price is good for the amount of tracks that you receive. However it was kind of boring so we purchased additional train station type parts. Still a very good deal just for the tracks. Works well with Thomas train engines. For some reason unlike other toys, trains are something that kids don't get too bored with and they seem to play with them every day."
4,Lots of fun!,My almost-three year old is having so much fun with this train set! She is very into trains and this is perfect for her age and ability level for building the tracks.
5,The Most Serious Performances,"I love these early works. But I have never heard performances remotely so serious, or perhaps better put, earnest, as on this CD. The readings are very poignant and convincing, but a little surprising given virtually every other performance. It says something about the depth of these early masterpieces that one does not exactly miss a more frothy vibe in the readings. Still, it seems a bit odd. But if you love the works, this is definitely one of the ones to have."
3,It works but it stinks!,"There is no arguing the benefits of neem oil and skin, particularly when you have certain skin conditions. Its healing properties are excellent and works fantastic, but there is one hitch. The pure Neem oil smells awful! I tried to endure it but could not stand it for long. The bottle says it could be added to a carrier oil, which might help reduce the very strong smell, but I have not tried it. If you are sensative to strong smells, I suggest you look at other products by this company, such as the neem oil soap, instead of attempting this. I can't even begin to describe the smell of it but it is nothing close to pleasant. If you have a strong resistance to strong odors than go for it. Or find a way to dilute it for use. I don't want to take away from the benefits of the product, but felt it important to warn others who are sensative to strong odors what they are in for."
4,used with success for scabies,"My boyfriend and I got scabies while also dealing with chemical sensitivity, so we couldn't use permethrin or even tea tree oil (which is probably the best natural treatment).So we used this, mixing it with jojoba oil (which is a nice way to dilute it, since it won't smell rancid the way olive oil or grape seed oil can smell after a while when you get them on your sheets and all). we would use it in baths too, a few drops.IT worked. took a few weeks but it worked."
1,DO NOT USE UNDILUTED NEEM OIL!,"Please read my other review about the extreme dangers when applying undiluted neem oil under ""Richard's Organics Neem Oil"".Our beloved dog died within a week's time after following the manufacturer's labeled instructions. She began with grand mal seizures--and then it progressed into severe central nervous system dysfunction, possible brain damage, etc.--ending in a terrible, frightening death. She had just had a wellness check with her vet a few weeks' prior to use of the undiluted oil.NEVER, NEVER apply undiluted neem oil on your pet--and keep it away from children and nursing mothers.Undiluted neem oil can cause the death of infants and children--there is no known antidote to neem oil poisoning."
3,Smells like a slow death!,"I got this for flaky skin. It reduced the flakes by 80% but the smell of this stuff literally made me sick to my stomach. I have a version in alcohol which has a tolerable smell. The smell of this version is NOT tolerable. Anything that comes into contact with it needs to be washed or put out of smelling distance.Anyway, I put it on flaky scalp and washed. I did this three days non consecutive and the condition improved considerably. After last night though, I threw the stuff away. The smell is just too bad."
2,Barely Adequate,"Purchased this flashlight for the purpose of hiking. Very small amount of light produced by this flashlight. Using the red filter makes the light pretty much useless. The green filter is barely any better. Using the light without any filter (white) allows for a small amount of light. This is certainly better than no flashlight - but for hiking I would strongly recommend that you purchase thePetzl TacTikka Plus 4-LED Headlamp, Black #E49Pinstead. Brought this along with the headlamps for use in a lava tube and on a night hike at Volcanoes National Park. Left these flashlights in our packs and used the headlamps - the headlamps were far brighter and far more useful."
1,"Don't buy it, it is knockoff, it is fraud","I brought it for my galaxy note, put on my hdmi and connected with my HDTV, it did not work at all,. I am really disappointed. I tried to use my friend 's OEM one, it was working properly.I am truly to tell everyone, don't buy it, it ony waste money but nothing."
2,Same old...,I bought this book as an infant caregiver and was a little disappointed to find out that it really was just the same old things we are already doing with our babies...maybe just with some slight twists.
5,Great book for new and not-so-new parents!,"I highly recommend this book... Both, my husband and I, really liked the book and thought it's a great resource for new and not-so-new parents... The books has a wonderful selection of games and rhymes. Easy-to-read/search format makes your experience quite enjoyable!"
2,Unhappy,This manual is not at all what I expected in a service manual. It provides basic information with specifications. Nothing like a Chilton's automotive repair manual.
1,MADE IN CHINA,"What a disgrace, these boots are MADE IN CHINA. For the price they are selling for this is ridiculous. Not worth the price for CHINESE MADE COWBOY BOOTS.I JUST BOUGHT A PAIR OF ARIAT SEDONA AND NOTICED THE BALANCE IS MAN-MADE. FURTHERMORE, THESE BOOTS ARE MADE IN CHINA. THEY ARE WORTHLESS. YOU TRY TO PASS THESE BOOTS FOR WESTERN/COWBOY BOOTS BUT THEY ARE WORTHLESS CHINESE BOOTS. WHAT A SHAME. I AM TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT THIS. IT IS NOT WORTH THE $140 I PAID AT SHEPLERDS. I AM RETURNING MY BOOTS. THEY ARE CHEAP GOODS"
5,El mejor estudio en profundidad sobre Matsuo Basho,"Un verdadero estudio en profundidad sobre este genio de la literatura universal, quizá el único, escrito por un gran especialista en la vida y la obra de Basho. Imprescindible para los que quieran adentrarse en todas las claves del hayku."
3,Very Noisy,"If you plan to use this thing in your hotel room at night to dry boots or gloves, better pack earplugs also!It blows cool air into the boots and dries eventually. Have used it with the AC adapter, expect the batteries would not last too long and make the until quite heavy."
2,Better Choices,"I'm a little disappointed in this dryer. I use it for ski boots that get almost daily use. A dryer with heated air would be more effective. It's also quite noisy, and lacks a timer. Though it can't use much power, I wish it would turn itself off after several hours' use. it gets the job done, but spending another $10 would have been money well spent to get heated air and a timer. There are better options out there. The 12v power would let you run it from a car, motor home, or boat, whcih may be useful to some people."
3,"Works fine, but very loud","This unit works fine at drying boots, but it's very loud on either slow or fast fan speed. I actually like that it uses room temp air as I've had heated models malfunction and melt gloves/boots before. So if you can put it in a closet away from living space, you're fine."
3,Wors good- but it's LOUD,"Excellent for drying boots and gloves, however be sure to have it in a different room, it runs a little loud. Almost too loud- makes it less convenient."
4,Best portable boot dryer for the money,We recently took this dryer on our family ski vacation and it performed well. It comes with both a/c and d/c cords and takes batteries as well although I can't imagine ever using that feature. It packs away compactly in a ski bag or luggage.
5,Wonderful!,"I feel I'm able to offer a very unbiased opinion here since I bought this kit in a Goodwill Store and didn't have to pay the full price. I love it! I hadn't even heard of it before. After just a couple of uses, I can see marked improvement, paticularly on my neck... the lines are disappearing. The smile lines may take a little longer :) My face also feels so clean and smooth. I don't know why whoever decided to give this away (maybe they couldn't be bothered with the regime, but it's ten minutes well spent) and the best $5.00 I ever spent!"
3,10 out of 10 from my daughter,"My daughter will give 10 out of 10 on this product. She loves it, it goes well with the other products in this range, she keeps her little toys in the storage bench, so I'm happy she's happy. Its suitable for young children but not for older children as not very strong."
4,Amazing (not so) Little Book!,"This book is soooooooo cool! I don't exactly own it (i'm borrowiong it from my best friend), I think I can give a pretty basic idea of whats happenig(based off the TV shows). Well, after Inuyasha pushes Kagome through the well that seperates her world from Inuyasha's, she goes back(of course, cuz they can't continue the series without Kagome)! Then they find naraku and they find out all about him and how he came to be and all that. Then they find out that Kikyo is still alive(god forbid) and Inuyasha goes and kisses her in front of Kagome and Kagome gets mad and Inuyasha gets mad and they all get mad and then Inuyasha says he really did have feeling for her, but she's asleep! ASLEEP!!!!!! There are nice sound FX, though, to make up for the [disappointing] ending (so it's only [disappointing] in my eyes...)!"
3,A few good songs but a lot of fillers too,Cut down your options is a truly amazing song and can be listened too forever. Other than that it has a few more tracks but most of the loops are too short which creates boredom quickly:boring songs = short loops + repetition + high hardcore + unstimulating rhymes + limited depth in samplingThey also sound too much like Dilated peoples a lot of the time. I know they are featured on the album but its too similar. I could give a lower score but that one song has kept it up there.
2,latches are loose; not puppy-proof,This cage is not puppy-proof! The latches are too loose and the dog can jiggle them open by pawing at the two doors. We got our first cage and noticed that our puppy was out when we returned home from work the first two days in a row that we used it. I decided to put the puppy in and set the video camera. She was able to get out in 3 1/2 minutes the first time just by pawing at the cage door. Put her back in and a second time got out in under 3 minutes. I was able to exchange the cage without problem with amazon(great customer service!!!) However she was able to get out of the second cage also. The latches are too loose and jiggle open when the dog paws at the cage.
4,"Natures GRAVE, not Gravel","Of this 3 pak of Horror movies, Natures Grave is quite good. The other two just plain stink. Evil Remains is too chatty, and the acting is horrible. In Gone Dark, the acting is so lame, I didn't bother to finish watching it. If you can find Natures Grave anywheres else, as a solo movie, and cheaper, I recommend you go that route, because the other two movies to this set are very lame, and were only thrown in to up the price. Natures Grave is an interesting take on a couple camping alone in the wilderness, and they seemingly disrespect the Natural Surroundings around them, so Nature strikes back. The suspense is very good, and the movie moves along at a pretty good pace. Not much nudity, but a little swearing, not much. Teens and adults should find this movie interesting."
3,A good synopsis?,"I first saw this film when it was originally released in 1955. I was 6 years old. It made a deep impression on me and inspired an interest in Greek mythology which public school teachers subsequently discouraged. While it has been at least 20 years since my last viewing of this film, I have always found it to be a satisfying, if superficial, synopsis of the original story by Homer (which I have read twice). It was even more satisfying than the mini series remake of the 1990s that appeared on TV."
2,"Interesting, but not Insightful","I found this work diary of Steinbeck to be far less informative than I had imagined it would be. Aside from his daily ruminations that he was unsure if ""Grapes"" would be a good book, there was little revealed as to his creative process. How did he create his characters? Why did he use certain plot devices? Where did his inspirations come from? All this was lacking.If you read Christopher Tolkien's works on his father's ""Lord of the Rings,"" you see the work created before you. You can see how a character developed, how a plot changed. In ""Working Days"" there is none of that. It is simply repetitive admonitions to himself to work harder. It became tedious and a great many times I wondered if the editor had simply repeated previous entries and only changed their number.""Working Days"" is interesting, but don't be fooled into thinking you are going to be there at the birth of a great novel."
2,skimming the surface with diary entries,"I found this book to be less informative than I thought it was going to be. I was hoping to see more of whats happened in Steinbeck's physche during his labor over The Grapes Of Wrath, but it doesnt really happen. This almost feels like he was asked to perform this task and he did it as an assignment rather than a labor of love."
1,The Abridged Aeneid,"I knew before buying the abridged audio book that i would not be completely satisfied. The story jumped around without warning, and the book ended without closure. After listening to the discs twice now i can say that I did not understand much. In addition, the parts I did understand i thought were copied directly out of the Iliad. I purchased the actual book and started to read it, because i refuse to believe that the famous Virgil i heard so much about could write what i heard."
5,Incomparable,"It's Virgil's answer to Homer. It's Rome's answer to Troy.Virgil may have imitated Homer, but he did not imitate his language and this remains the finest example of literary genius in the Latin language. It has been splendidly translated in this Everyman edition."
4,An Enlightening Book,"How do good and evil intersect and manifest themselves in our daily lives? How do our pasts -- and our past lives -- figure in these interactions? Read The Awakening -- an enlightening book that's the result of a truly extraordinary story -- for some startling (and heartening) answers. (Jeff Durstewitz, co-author, Younger Than That Now -- A Shared Passage From the Sixties)"
3,Kroker/Weinstein have a clue,"contrary to the prior reviewers, and despite my heavy training in university level (hons) british-style analytic philosophy, i found their book incredibly interesting, particularly their concept of the virtual class, a concept i've already written (crystal clear) papers on, one prior to kroker et al., and one in response. i believe they have much to say, but like most postmodern writers, get swamped in ""blather"" as the other reviewer called it, and spew out lots of characterisations of internet culture while disregarding clarity. but this is nothing new for postmodernists. it's quite conventional, in fact. they substitute philosophic rigour for flair. IMHO, if you're interested in internet as a cultural phenomenon, you MUST read this book. even if it displays some technological ignorance and a lot of lack of rigour. i found it fascinating, but turgid...."
2,Intellectual puffery?,"The questions need to be asked, true. Our society's fetishization of technological progress and free markets need to be challenged, and that is the best role for the Krokers and similar critics: poking the hornets nest and seeing who gets stung.But there is bigger question when studying Data Trash, Hacking the Future and the Krokers' other techno-dystopian tomes: does all this jargon and rhetoric actually add up to anything? The Krokers are great at stirring the pot, but seem to have some fundamental misconceptions about the nature of technology and how, in a practical sense, it is accepted or rejected by people."
4,colar,overall its nice vibrate wakes up the dog but it could beep louder as I would like to hear it at a small distance and its difficult to hear defeats the purpose of me to find the dog being she cant hear.
5,excellently styled with plenty of warmth,"We are very pleased with the style, craftmanship, and warmth of this Jacket. Thankyou for an satisfying deal with Jacket and price."
5,Khan voice adds Magic,"Kamelot before the addition of Roy Khan as lead vocalist had barely tapped into the metal market, but with the addition of Khan and the release of The Fourth Legacy, they have made their mark. Fourth Legacy shows you how Power Metal should be and without the cheese. Beginning strong with the intro track leading into Fourth Legacy, this album is a roller coaster ride from the very beginning, through the Arabian sounding Desert Reign and Nights of Arabia, through the hard Inquisitor, through the ballads of Glory and the Sailorman's Hymn till its grand finale with Lunar Sanctum. This is the album that put Kamelot on the metal map for a reason. Because its such a work of art! Its power metal at its best with one of the best vocalists of our time. Buy this CD and you will not be disappointed!"
4,A must have for Kamelot fans,"The first thing I noticed is the production isn't what it is on any of the later albums...and even the songwriting is a bit different. But that's not a bad thing at all. Some albums you have to listen to a few times before they grow on you. Not the case here. Even though it is a bit different than later efforts, it grows you you quickly, like during the second song. There are a couple of slower songs I could have done without but there are also songs that you shouldn't be without if you're any bit of a Kamelot fan.First time listeners should probably check out The Black Halo, Epica, One Cold Winter's Night and even Ghost Opera. But if you have all of those and are looking to add to your collection, don't hesitate to pick this up, you won't be disappointed at all."
3,It becomes boring fast...,"THE SAHDOW OF UTHER is one of the greatest songs ever!!! IT's catchy, it's hooks are great, and the harmonic solo at the end is fantastic, up lifiting!! But this CD is no so good. Some are the songs are clear fillers. But the singer (Khan) is very talented."
2,"Well, what great reviews for an average album...!!","Whatever merits this album can have, nothing can disguise the fact that it is just another one of the infinite albums produced by German producer and guitarrist Sascha Paeth, which are flooding the market with dozens (or hundreds?) power metal bands that sound just the same: the obligatory double-kick drums, a lead with an over the edge voice, choruses sung with lots of background vocals, the occasional keyboard, the epic introductory song, lyrics talking about glory, battle, the Crusades, the Templars, kings and queens, death in battle, honour, the Dark Ages, King Arthur, Middle-Earth, knights in armour, etc......Well, at least better this way than to stand Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Backstreet Boys, MAdonna, Spice Girls, etc..................."
2,In a word: overrated,"I expected it to be good...but I was horribly underwhelmed by this album. The band displays good musicianship and the vocalist is above-average, but the overwrought lyrics and uninteresting melodies couldn't get me excited. Most of the fast and heavy songs lack intensity, though the ballads are pretty good (mainly due to the vocalist). The CD plods for way too long...about halfway through this disc I kept glancing to my CD player wondering when it was going to end. It starts promising but quickly degenerates into boring, average power metal. The production doesn't help matters, and it makes the album hard to get into."
5,Can't live without it!,We got this as a gift before our daughter was born. I tried early on to switch her loveys and blankets so she wouldn't get attached to just one. My plan didn't work. She picked this as her favorite. Now we can't live without it. She sleeps with it for every nap and at night. She is now 19 months old and it is still in great condition.
4,"Great bunny, a little different than our original","Bought this as a back up to my daughters original bunny. The fur is different, the original bunny has a loose, string-like quality, giving it a more ragged, well loved antiquey look to it. This world fine as a back up, though when given a choice she prefers the original one. Would love to find one like that! But have searched with no luck!"
5,Gind Bear Instructer,"The recipient of the Gund ""Teach Me Dress-up Bear"" was inthralled-- she would not let it go. The bear arrived in very good shape and on time. I would buy such an item on Amazon again."
1,Junk!!!,"This is a rotten product. Only one port works consistently, while the other three respond intermittently. Save yourself some frustration and spend a little more money on something better."
1,No Melodies on this CD,"This CD is very disappointing for customers who like Rai. It is just a bunch of random sounds without any unifying theme. Furthermore, I don't think it's good for dancing!"
2,very different,"I love New Age music and World Beat so I figured I'd give this CD a try. There are a couple songs on this CD that I really like that do have sort of a a Middle Eastern flavor, others with a 'temple' sound to them. I like that, believe me, but most of the other songs just remind me of sound effects from my son'sX-Box games. Way too 'out there' and 'spacey' for me. If you're looking for New Age music with somewhat of a Hindi flavor, I would try the groups ""Govinda"" ""Ikarus"" ""Waterbone"" or ""Delerium"" to name a few."
1,dance music?,"I was very disappointed by this CD although I buy all belly dance CDs on the market and use at least some material on each. On this one there is almost nothing to be used by a belly dancer. Great for Star Trek, though, or for trance dance. Is this really a tribal CD??????????"
1,A very great decepcion on Tribal Music,"Hi! My daughter and I are fans of Rachel Brice very own style of tribal bellydance. I bought both the DVD and Music Cd for our collection.But for my suprise it wasn't what we expected. I have several tribal music including the Solace collection , and one of the songs Cybelle which is my favorite. This version was a Killer!!! Don't waste your money in this CD."
5,COMPOSURE at last for my 10 year old labrador!,"My lab has always been neurotic, and we have tried every herbal remedy and prescription. Drugs made him loopy and the herbal remedies never seemed to do anything. My dog displayed major anxiety when I left the house and was eliminating indoors without reason. This went on for years until we found this product. So amazing...."
5,Took the edge off Fear based reactivity,"I have a 6yr old pointer mix dog that I got at 3yrs. He is highly reactive to bikes, skateboards, anything with a diesel engine, other dogs and some people (and a few other things). I had done reactivity training and that laid the groundwork for calming but he was so bad and he would still erupt with force. I tried this product and after a couple weeks noticed a slight differnce so kept going. My dog has been on it for 6 weeks and I can can clearly see improvement. I have been able to reduce the dosage to 2/3 the recommended dose. Using this product has made him calmer in previously tense situations. While he will never totally lose his reactivity to all of his fears, this product has really taken the edge off and made our twice daily walks much more pleasant for both of us."
4,worked for anxious lab/border collie,"I tried this for my dog w/anxious and fearful temperament. It seemed to take about a month of mixing in with her food daily, but she did become much less reactive in her fearful situations. After using for around 6 months we discontinued (it's expensive!) to see if she would do well without it. She has been pretty good for about 6 months but gradually seems more anxious again. I am planning to try another course of composure to see if it helps again. Maybe it is something she will need on and off to maintain, well, composure!"
2,Composure Liquid Max for Cats,Haven't found that it calmed my Maine Coon at shows at all. Tried it severl time and was disappointed each occasion.
2,Smelly. Murky. Separates easily.,"Really smells terrible. Bleh.Plus the cap was broken when I took delivery of it, and it was messy, to boot.I like the anxiety drops that come in the small eye dropper better."
2,I don't think it did anything to help my dog.,I used the product after my vet recommended it. My collie has problem with a nervous stomach. I tried it and it didn't seem to make a difference.
2,Did not work for my dog.,"I have a hyperactive Belgian Malinois. I was wanting something that would calm her for visitors to our home, and going out into public, as she tends to be very high strung and easily excited. I have tried using this product at different dosages and times to the stessors, but it does not seem to make a difference in her attention deficit and hyperactivity, or reactivity. Maybe it will work for some other breed, or for cats."
2,Didn't work for our 15 year old Yorky,I had realistic hopes for this based on the mixed reviews. For us it didn't seem to make a diffidence at all. Our Yorky suffers from separation anxiety and we had hoped this might calm him down some but we didn't see a spec of difference. Amazon took it back with no problems.
2,Didn't work for us,"We have an Australian Shepherd/Border Collie mix that is afraid of any loud noise; he shakes uncontrollably during thunderstorms or fireworks. We have tried everything and were hopeful of this product since the reviews were so good, but after giving daily doses for over two months, there has been no change."
4,Composure Liquid,After numerous problems with the Post Office (still don't know who they delivered to) I was finally able to recieve my product. Ashley was very helpful in doing all that was in her power to make sure I received what I ordered.
4,PAMMY'S REVIEW,SUPRISINGLY A BIG HIT BECAUSE IT WASN'T THE NEWER POWER RANGER PRODUCT. GOOD PRICE AND APPEARS DURABLE. A BIG HIT WITH MY 4 YEAR OLD GRANDSON!
2,Falling Apart,"They look nice, but they're badly put together; I had to re-sew all of the fingers within the first month."
3,"Thumbs up, overall.","I actually purchased this book for the information and photos of 3 shields of Spanish origin, so I can't really comment upon the quality of info on native american shields. Photos were good, but wish they had been in color. The information about the construction and materials used in the Spanish shield was good."
4,"Great Chips, but bags have vey little in them","I have been eating these chips, and loving them for about a year now. I order this 24 pack every other month and leave them in my office. They taste great, but I wish there were just a little more in each bag."
2,Crunchy but too hard to eat,"The only thing good about this product is the packaging. The chips themselves are okay, not great. Very crunchy, but about 50% of the chips in the bags are very hard to chew on. They are as hard as rocks. I bought 12 bags a few months ago and still have about 5 left. For each bag, I can eat about 1/3 (those red and orange chips and taro are not too bad). The rest of the bag is thrown away because those translucent chips are as hard as rock. Maybe some people like this kind of chips. Do yourselves a favor and try some at the grocery first before buying in bulk."
5,addictive,worse than all illegal substances - completely addictive... proof that God loves us! Ha! Seriously - best chip I ever had! yum yum yum...
2,"Greasy, Broken","I thought I'd really found a great treat to eat, but all the bags in the case contained a lot of finely broken pieces, and the product is very greasy. Would not buy this again."
3,half of the bag is amazing,"These chips are quite literally a mixed bag. If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips. The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew. The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark. I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them. I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers. They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce. It's a shame, because the yuccas are really dragging this bag of chips down and keeping me from recommending it. Get with it, Terra!"
3,Too Hard...,"While the spice used is good, the chips themselves are too hard...the sweet potato was fine but the majority are like thin sheets of glass, which is not nice in the mouth... I would not buy these again, just too hard..."
3,"YUMMY CHIPS, ALSO KNOWN TO ME AS BAG OF CRUMBS","I FIRST BEGAN BUYING THESE CHIPS WHEN I WAS DATING MY HUSBAND, THAT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO, WE CAME ACROSS THEM WHEN WE WERE VISITING A MUSEUM, EVER SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN HOCKED, THE CHIPS ARE COLORFUL, AND BURSTING WITH FLAVER, THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IN MY EXPERIENCE IS IT DOESNT MATER WERE I PURCHASED THEM, ABOUT 15%-25% ARE REGULAR SIZED CHIPS, THEN THEY GET SMALLER AND SMALLER FROM THERE, PRETTY SOON I AM LEFT WITH A LARGE PILE OF CRUMBS!!! WHICH YES I EAT, BECASUSE THEY ARE YUMMY, IT SURE IS ANOYING AND FRUSTRATING, BECASUE OF THE AMOUNT OF CRUMBS AND THE SKY HIGH PRICE, {THE MOST EXPENSIVE CHIPS I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS.} I TRY NOT TO BUY THEM SO OFTEN ANYMORE, HENCE THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD RATING"
3,Too hard to chew and expiring,"I thought this one would be better than the blue potato that I tried 3 months ago as it has better review/rating, but it turned out to be a bad one. I am not sure if it became that hard to chew just because it is expiring in 1 month, but it hurt my teeth and jaw after finishing half of the first bag. My jaw became clicking sound and I had to see my doctor after eating this. I think three forth of the chips in each bag are those hard ones. Now, the remaining became the feeding food for the squirrels. Conclusion: 2 problems: (1) those 24 bags are expiring in one month; and (2) most of the chips are too hard to bite."
1,Watch out for Canola oil,These chips are indeed tasty. But one of the main ingredients is canola oil. Unfortunately 93% of canola oil used in the US is genetically modified. [...] Unless the canola oil says it's organic it's GMO.
3,Terra Tomato Chips,These chips are not as good as the other Terra products I have tried. They are too spicy to taste anything but spice and they also have a shape and texture that are not very good.
2,broken chips,"no visible package damage, As each bag was opened, small pieces of broken chips. Yes, they did taste okay to eat."
4,Good potato chip alternative,"I had some of these Terra chips for the first time a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how good they were! I have since tried the Original, Mediterranean, and Sweets and Beets flavors. I liked them all, so I'm looking forward to trying even more of the flavors in the future. There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies. This makes them a great alternative to chips with more nutritional value. I really like them and enjoy having them for a snack now and then. I like the Mediterranean flavor best out of the ones I've tried so far, but they are all really good."
4,Pos's and Neg's,"I bought these for everyone in our family because we ski and snowboard.The pluses are that these are small and can be easily transported without taking up space. They do dry the boots overnight as advertised. Very convenient that way.The downside is that these can only be used on boots, because gloves and mittens will not allow enough air to circulate to make the bullet safe to use.Though more expensive and cumbersome, I ended up getting dryguy's boot dryer (with the four prong things sticking up) as well. We use the boot dryer for mittens and gloves, and the bullets for boots.If I had it to do over again, I think I'd just buy the even larger boot dryer, and forego the bullets."
2,Not recommended,"The dryer does its job, but it started to deform just after the 2nd use. The plastic lost its shape. The dryer is still functional, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Not a dryer at all!,"If you can imagine the smell of a burnt circiut board and dead fish then you can imagine owning these! I was afraid they were going to catch my new $300 boots on fire, whaaaaaat!!!!!"
2,The Basics Only,"This book was fairly well-written, I found it readable and didn't find any glaring errors. That said, I found next to nothing on these subjects:- Natural or organic hair care products- Styling your own hair- Braiding- Updos- Long hair: care, concerns, special needs or special warnings- Identifying quality implements and caring for implements- Uses of hair accessories you may not be familiar with (eg rats, hair sticks, etc.)There was a lot of very basic and general information on many subjects including hair loss, alopecia, etc., and it is a good general sourcebook. However if you are looking for in-depth, or even just detailed, treatments of your areas of interest, look elsewhere. I returned this book after reading it through very gently."
2,The uncertainity of our relationships,"In Her Absenceby Antonio Munoz Molinaas well asConjugal Loveby Alberto Moraviaare far better books in analyzing relationships. Both involve a self-conscious narrator who analyzes his relationship - often seeing it with the clarity that could have saved it but also often deluding himself to keep it going when it is obvious (to the reader) that it is over.I should say that though I tried to read Marriage, I did not read it completely. I skipped through the first novella and found it mildly interesting but it did not engage me enough to keep at it. I returned the book unread even though it was a short novel and I had picked it up at the library because I was intrigued by the theme of the stories."
1,Plunger sticks to easily,"While this product works as described it can be difficult to use. Several people in our household have tried this product and we all have the same problem. The plunger in the middle stays in the down position for easy storage. The way to get it to stay in this position is to push the rubber button in the middle of the plunger. You push it again to get it to return to the up and ready position. Here's the problem. To get the basket spinning inside you push the plunger down but without pushing the rubber button in the middle. This proves to be not that easy of a task. If you don't push the plunger down just right, and it does take some pressure to do this, the plunger stays in the down and locked position since your hand tends to push on the button. You then have to push the button to release it and start all over again. Quite a faulty design."
1,stinks,"Not worth the price we paid. Broke after the second time we used it. What a shame, we have an amazing crop of lettuce this year."
2,Not built to last.,The inner basket eventually became warped and then the insides of the plunger broke when I got just a little too vigorous with it.
1,Garbage. Do not buy,"We bought this at a large bulk discount store ""club"". What a piece of garbage! The plunger mechanism broke after the 2nd use. It's going back and, based on other reviews here, I'm getting my money back and not exchanging.Sadly disappointing as I was trusting in the KitchenAid name brand. Learned that lesson."
1,Sound too good to be true? It is.,"The first thing a level needs to do is lie flat. Without a straight edge, a bubble means nothing. Save yourself time and money and don't buy a cheap 8' level. My Empire ""True Blue"" arrived bowed 1/16th over 8' not to mention the entire level was very flexible. I doubt that any I beam style level is any good at 96"". Go for a box beam frame."
4,The Tardis is Awesome,"This toy is really cool. It's got lots of little details that Dr. Who fans will appreciate. I was surprised by it's size, too. It's quite big and took about 30 minutes to put together, but it was worth it. And the sound effects are great."
5,Awsome toy!!,"Tardis set was a little hard to put together, but a lot of fun to play with. Lights and sound are very realistic."
5,Gotta love the Tardis!,"The Tardis really comes to life and it is really 'Bigger on the inside!"".A little tough to put together and store in one piece---it is worth it if you are a big Dr. fan like me. Hours of fun. Would buy again!"
1,NOT ALL LEATHER BOOTS,"What a disgrace, these boots are MADE IN CHINA. For the price they are selling for this is ridiculous. Not worth the price for CHINESE MADE COWBOY BOOTS.I JUST BOUGHT A PAIR OF ARIAT SEDONA AND NOTICED THE BALANCE IS MAN-MADE. FURTHERMORE, THESE BOOTS ARE MADE IN CHINA. THEY ARE WORTHLESS. YOU TRY TO PASS THESE BOOTS FOR WESTERN/COWBOY BOOTS BUT THEY ARE WORTHLESS CHINESE BOOTS. WHAT A SHAME. I AM TELLING EVERYONE ABOUT THIS. IT IS NOT WORTH THE $140 I PAID. I AM RETURNING MY BOOTS. THEY ARE CHEAP GOODS."
1,Please unplug these guys.,Rob Thomas and his crew from S.S. Matchbox 20 give us a lesson in putting on a poor live show with this less-than-special release. Each track fails to deliver and leaves the listener a little sea sick. Save your money and avoid this album and any plans of seeing them live.
1,Matchbox fails to deliver,"Matchbox 20 fails to deliver on this poorly performed live compilation. Clearly much of the fault lies in the production, however, producers may not have had much to work with as Rob Thomas and bandmates leave much to be desired in their live performances."
3,Not 4 Me,Nothing is wrong with this product! I forgot to pay attention to where the ringer was. I wanted a right handed one. This is a lefty. I reordered a black one because I just didn't like the silver in person.
4,My grandkids love these bike bells.,"I got a pink and a blue bike bell for my grandkids bicycles. We had purchased bells from a discount retailer and the thumb post broke off in only a few weeks. It was plastic. They love the colors of these bells and use them when they feel the need. Paper sticker with the words may wear off or come off someday, but worth the price."
1,Piece of crap,"This bike bell literally fell apart the first day I hooked it to my bike. As I was riding, I rang the bell for someone to move out of the lane and the top part of the bell flew off, rendering the bell useless.Complete waste of money."
3,You get what you pay for,"The bright I"" love my bike logo"" fades within a week and the switch to ring the bell has stuck a couple of times. I suppose none of this would have happened if the bike had been stored inside this summer."
2,Already rusted after a month,I was not satisfied. It has rust all over it after only a month of being outside. Would not recommend. Sorry.
3,Works on almost anything,Its a typical bell and works well. My daughter really likes it on her trike. The only thing I did not like is that its easy for a kid to unscrew the top and disassemble it. That is what my son did. Once I found the top I just screwed it back on.
2,Does not stand up straight!,"The concept of a bachpack attached to the carry-on is neat! But, the whole thing just won't stand on its feet! You need to keep holding it all the time... which if you ask me is quite painful!"
3,An good book at the time it was written.,"I bought this book about 20 years ago and still have it. Considering the time that it was written, it was better than average. It is still a good resource and research item. There were some publishing errors such as mis-identified stances in photos. In his day, he was a reputation as an excellent fighter. It is unfortunate that he lost his way and became a criminal. The two men that appear in the book with him are Terry Updike and George Dobly. The demonstation photos were taken in Terry's dojang, which was in Torrance, CA at that time. Apparently, Garcia had not trained in a while, when the book was written. Updike and Dolby had to assist him with some items in the book."
4,empty force,"paul Dong's book explains a very important part about the mysteries surrounding chi, including numerous exercises to practice."
4,Great Idea Book,"As Beth Cote, one of the authors, says, you don't need any artistic ability to make altered books and that's the best part of this wonderful guide. You can do it! I'm an art therapist in an assisted living center for Alzheimer's patients and this book has served me and my patients well. With glue, markers and vanishing memory they are able create altered books every bit as wonderful as those shown in this book. So, if you're color blind, memory challenged and can't draw a darn thing to save your life, you can still be an altered book artist. Get this great picture guide and alter by the numbers."
2,"Not ""101"" enough","I was disappointed in this book. I found that it was less of a beginner's guide and more of a ""isn't this neat!"" book. I did not find the information to be detailed enough for me as a beginner and the format made it hard to pick out important information or techniques. There are some very nice projects in the book, but, again, I found it hard to follow the directions in order to learn the technique the projects were teaching."
4,Creative Journaling!,I bought a couple of books for an Art instruction. This books have ideas and details on how to create inspiring journals. Altered 3D-books and ideas in content. I recommend for those teaching how to create books out of the box
4,Altered Books 101,"This is a good basic instruction book for someone looking to start their first altered book. It is rather slim and if you are looking for a lot of step by step pictures, this is not the book for you. It does give basic instructions."
2,disapointed,I've ordered several books over the internet and this is the first time I was ever disapointed. The book was bent and the spine was torn loose from the front and back cover. It was not in good condition when I received it.
3,"Moves air well, but is noisy and hard to start up after regular use","I have one of these fans sitting on my desk blowing air at me as I write this. It's keeping me cool, but there are a few things I would like to change.Pros:- Moves air very well even on low setting- Oscillation works well for a cheap fan- Can be used as a desktop fan or a clip-on fan- Adjustable hinge mountCons:- Noisy (no whisper quiet here, more like a highly-muffled airplane prop)- After a period of time, turning the fan on low does not get the blades moving; you have to put it on high, let it run for a few seconds, then put it on low- The hinge mount is made out of plastic, so if you adjust the angle of this fan a lot, there is the possibility of the hinge teeth grinding down or breakingSince I am using this fan in an office setting, the noise is my biggest gripe since I have to turn off the fan to talk to anyone on the phone or in my office."
1,Disappointed!,"I too am not happy with this fan. It didn't work right the day I received it. When I turn it on, it takes a good minute or two for it to start. Maybe I need to try what the other customer said, and that is to take off the screen and use WD-40, although this should not be necessary in a new fan."
1,Haier fan not worth the money,Wondered if I was the only one that the fan only worked for about a month and then would take 4-5 minutes before it would start up. Finally it stopped altogether and began to smell like it was overheating. Would not recommend spending money on it. Got it mainly since it was oscillating and had a stand AND clip.
5,Excellent little fan!,"Even on low setting it moves a LOT of air. The dual stand (stand + clip-on thingy) is quite useful. Only downside: it's a little loud on high setting, but you do have a monsoon in your room."
2,Full of information but rather dry.,"I have no doubt that Police Procedural is a mother lode of information about the police, but the tone is so dry and factual that I found myself unable to make it through the book. Had the writers attempted to keep the tone more conversational (as in Scene of the Crime, Private Eyes, and Missing Persons), Police Procedural would be much more effective. As is, it is still useful as a spot reference, but I found it rather hard to read."
3,Basic Info,"This book covers the basics of police departments, investigations, crimes and arrests, and the judicial system. I would not use this as my sole source because every state has different laws, obviously. So does every branch of law enforcement. It was interesting learning the layout of a typical police station."
2,An okay cute Teddy,"My four year old was very excited when he received this item. He immediately went to try to tie Baby Gund's shoes and found that the strings were too short to make rabbit ears. After many tries, he eventually put the bear down and has not picked it up again. I thought this would be a fun experience for him to learn how to tie shoes, but it wasn't. I didn't bother to send the bear back to avoid any hassle, only just put him on my son's dresser for decoration. I only give this Bear 2 stars for cuteness.Darlene P. Newark, N.J."
5,Favorite toy,"I got this bear for my son when he was an infant. He is almost 9 now and still takes him everywhere we go. My two year old nephew met ""Teddy"" and now wants him for himself. Since ""Teddy"" has become a part of our family now...I am buying one for my nephew to enjoy as well.As for a teaching tool...I'm not so sure this is the greatest item on the market."
1,poor quality,"The audio quality is so poor here, it's hard to imagine they had the audacity to put it out. It would be alright, if they named it ""Bootleg"", but they didn't. Too bad, too, because there are some good songs here."
4,Fun academic type mystery,Bel Barret teaches writing at a community college in NJ. Her friend Vinny Vallone talks her into teaching a class of funeral director wannabes with him. Vinnie is murdered and it seems that most of the suspects are in the writing class. Bel risks her relationships and her life to solve the mystery.This was a pretty quick read and I enjoyed it. The characters and the setting are quirky and interesting. A good series.
1,Boring,Another author that fills the pages with inane conversations because the book is so lacking in a good plot.
1,To be avoided...,"I do not recommend Nu-teck airless tires they are very dangerous Nu-teck says that there tires are guaranteed to never go flat!! well that's a lie, mine went flat, that did not bother me to much. until I asked for a new tire. they said that it's my fault for using the breaks to hard. and I created soft spot. well I'm 67 years old I have a small folding bike 20 inch wheels I only use the bike to go back and forth to the store, I don't race or jam on the break. Nu-teck, just wants to get out of the guarantee. Nu-teck is a bad company to do business with, ricktig.dk is the same company, don't do business with them, if you could help me so other people don't get flim flamed tell your friend not to buy airless tires. and if you see Nu-teck ad please cut and paste let others know. this company is not honorable and does not stand behind it's guaranteed, I'm putting this company on ripoff.com and youtube, BBB and 7 on your side, plus, bob williams"
5,Bayou Cookin' Receipes,"This Great receipe book was published in 1959 & has wonderful basic ideas that are delicious,mostly easy & basic to creating great tasting Louisana dishes!"
5,Tested for 37 years,"I'm a California girl, who moved to New Orleans in 1972. I quickly found that the ladies coveted their ""special"" recipes and didn't share their secrets. It could have been a family thing. At any rate, lucky me, I purchased this book and quickly came up with my own ""special"" recipes. When I returned to CA, I was actually asked for one of my recipes by my sister-in-law. I used the opportunity to get one of her recipes :^) I bought a copy for each of my children. It's all good."
5,Favorite Cookbook,"I bought this cookbook years ago while visiting Baton Rouge, and it is one of my favorites. The recipes are simple, uncomplicated and just plain good! You can't go wrong with this cookbook if you are looking for real Creole cuisine and I highly recommend it."
4,The one essential Louisiana cookbook,"This is the quintessential Louisiana cookbook. If you're going to buy one Cajun/Creole cookbook, this is the one. It is impossible to overstate the significance of this book's influence on the tastes of South Louisiana. Because it was the first cookbook to feature both Cajun and Creole dishes it became a staple of virtually every kitchen. As a result, it became the standard for ""The Way it's Supposed to Taste."" I give it an ""8"" due to the fact that it is nearing 40 years old, and the recipes and ingredients reflect 50's standards of health and nutrition, rather than the late 90's. But, if you want to taste the classic dishes, this is the place"
4,Good cookin',This is the finest cookbook I have evr\er owned. It has all recipes that are popular in the south.Book came promptly and packaging was good.love River Road Recipes.
4,Fun -but not for every day use,"I enjoyed reading this cookbook and feel certain I'll use it one day, but it's not the best for every day cooking. It's a bit old fashioned and many of the recipes are very high in fats and calories."
2,Don't buy it.,"This was not what I was hoping for. The tracts repeat , I truly believe they could have done a lot better in recording this CD. It doesn't help my 3nd grader at all. Not happy with this product. I would not recommend this for a child who is having problems with there multiplications."
3,rap on,"liked the presentation, wished there had been more practice, don't need to learn 1's, 11's and 12's...I wish that during the part where the child was suppose to answer that they gave the correct answer after a reasonable length of time for child to practice"
5,"Fast, fun and informative","I like it because the concept is interesting: get your space station modules into orbit and locked on to the hub. Don't suffer booster failure, or loose your launch window.The graphics are beautiful and very well done, which gives it a more real-world feel to it than other games.I specially like that it's very easy to teach and learn, so it's easy to get new or younger players involved. The rules are simple and clear.The rules also make for a fast paced game with many twists and turns. You really have to be on your toes and think on your feet.Very nice! The Schwartz/Toman team came up with another winner!"
4,"A little expensive, but tastier than tablets","Our veterinarian suggested these soft chews for our yellow lab for preventative arthritis. She is about 7 years old, and these will hopefully keep the inevitable arthritis under control for a few years.Our picky eating dog definitely prefers these soft, tasty chews over the tablets that Glyco-Flex also makes, but they are more expensive. We now usually buy the tablets because you get more. She doesn't like them as much as the soft chews, but will eat them ;)"
4,Great Deal and Great Toy,"Tons of fun and a low price point. I bought this for a 7 year old and he loves it! Unfortunately one of the buttons on the baseball popped off as soon as I bought it, however it works. Dollar for dollar a great video game and unlike most video games it has kids swinging a bat and pitching a ball"
4,First one broke,"The product is great for some quality time with my two sons.However, the first one broke which led to a lot of disappointment.So far the second one is holding up pretty well. Hopefully it stays that way."
5,GREAT INDOOR GAME,THIS WAS A REAL HIT WITH MY GRANDSON (10) AND ALL THE FAMILY. WE PLAYED ALL THREE LEVELS WELL INTO THE EVENING ON CHRISTMAS DAY. EVEN THE TWO YEAR OLD WAS ABLE TO GET INTO THE ACT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE WITH A LITTLE LEAGUE LOVER OF BASEBALL.
1,"labeled ""non latex"" but I had a reaction","I purchased these exact cosmetic sponges a week ago. Specifically because the package was labeled ""non latex"", and I thought I'd try a sponge applicator instead of the cosmetic brushes I normally use. I'd been wanting to get the smooth application of a sponge, but have been wary to try one because I have an allergy to latex. So when I saw the ""non latex"" label, thought I'd give it a try. The sponge applied my foundation makeup beautifully & looked great! However, the next morning I had a typical ""latex reaction"" (dermatitis) all over my face: rough, itchy skin. Which is still continuing 6 days later so far. I'm taking an antihistimine which helps a little. Just wanted to post this, so anyone with a latex allergy (dermatitis reaction) will be aware of my experience with this product."
3,Giraffe poster,Smaller than we thought. Should have read the dimensions. My fault. The triangle box it came in was perfect because of its durability
5,WOW...WOW...WOW!!,"A page turner...I could not put it down. I enjoyed it better than ""Disappearing Acts"" (one of my favorite books)...Cinnamon Brown had something ""Zora Banks"" did not have...and that was ""options"". Ms. Carr has made finding love, funny, intense and enjoyable. The characters at times seem to ""jump off the page""...I was truely feeling them. I've had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Carr in person, and I can truely say that she has managed to put her own personal ""zest and zeal"" for life all up in this book. A Great book...waiting for Part II."
5,"Sensual, Loving & Learning","I found Ms. Carr's novel to be spellbounding and very entertaining. I am an avid reader of love stories and this is a very sensual book which shows how true love and friendship can be found - as long as one continues the search. Many times we women may have to kiss many frogs before meeting our prince, but in the end, it can all work out for good. I found this book to hold my interest from beginning to end and I highly recommend women - of all ethnicities - to read this one.I give this book a ""Whopping Thumbs Up""!!!!Ms.Amazon Reader(Chicago)"
3,Chris is a bit rusty here,"Never Scared sounds like a series of outtakes from Bigger and Blacker, updated with more recent content. And some of the content isn't all that relevant: Rock still invokes O.J. Simpson and Michael Jackson as if they are eternal icons of black celebrity insanity, but the worst is his insistence that affirmative action is the biggest problem in the black community. Rock's delivery is becoming tired, but he still makes me laugh at jokes another comedian wouldn't make me even smile at.The album is divided into alternating tracks from the stand-up routine and some variably funny fake, white rap radio show that doesn't really add much. I found this distracting as I felt Rock was trying to hide the lack of substance with mediocre interludes in order to make the routine stand out.Bigger and Blacker remains Rock's greatest album. Never Scared has a few funny moments, but little you haven't heard before."
2,A Nearly Complete Disappointment,"We should probably all get over _Roll With The New_. Rock's most classic bits all come from that CD, and it won't be topped anytime soon. Even with that in mind, I find _Never Scared_ to be almost a total waste of time. There are some funny bits, but much of the album is Rock expressing anger or other negative emotions in a non-comic way. It really feels more like venting than comedy. Bottom line: few laughs."
1,Bycicle Bridge,product does not work with newer versions of Windows. Don't buy. Shipper is fine. They shipped promptly and accurately. The product just does not work unless you have an old computer.
1,Return and refund,"The bridge game (Bicycle Bridge) on CD that I purchased was not compatible with my pc, I return the item (as instructed by the seller) for refund over 3 weeks ago and have as yet to receive my refund on purchase. I am not sure your refund policy is a strong as I would have expected from Amazon. Could you give me any suggestions as to how to proceed for my refund from what I have already done?Thanks,Marvin"
2,disappointed right off the bat!,"just used the spreader for the first time today and was disappointed right from the start. the unit has good balance and rolls easily, but the little wire clip that is suppose the keep the grass seed flowing through the holes to the spreader plate doesn't work!! it is just a skinny little piece of wire and isn't effective at all. had to keep gauge holes wide open to get any seed flow. engineering must have gone on break when that part of the unit was being developed. needless to say the whole unit doesn't work very well if the product you are trying to apply dosen't flow well. very disapointed !! other than that, it seems to be a well made product."
5,"An older recording, but still the best one!","This is an older German recording of Schutz's Swan-song, his last work, which set Psalm 119 to music. It first came out when LP's were still in fashion, and I remember buying a double LP set about 30 years ago.It's a fantastic recording. The double choirs are nicely balanced, and the boys choir comes in on the highlights in a most glorious manner, accompanied throughout by the ancient instruments.I've heard many other recordings of this work that have been released since, but none of them approach the beauty and glory of this one. Many of them lack the full music resources required to do justice to the choral endings of each section of the Psalms, some of them are performed too fast. But this one gets it all right. The endings for the first few Psalm sections still sends shivers down my spine.Schutz himself would have approved!"
3,Waistpack,"It works okay, but it's too heavy when the water bottles are filled. I will try to find small bottles that will work."
2,Paint flakes off; not worth it!,"I thought this would be a nice project for my niece. The painting was difficult, because (of course) the ball rolls. However, the worst part, is that the paint is not made durable enough, it chips off with use. It's a soccer ball! Of course it's going to be kicked, the paint should be made to withstand that kind of contact."
1,Can I give zero stars?,"This was a present from my wife. It's hard to overstate the awfulness of this piece of overpriced garbage. To spin dry salad, you need to push the center handle down firmly to build up momentum--but you need to stop just short of pushing the handle all the way down, or it will lock up in its ""storage"" position. It's even more awkward than it sounds.On the plus side, the construction of the spinner is as lousy as the design, so the gears stripped within a matter of weeks, preventing me from having to pretend for very long that I liked my present. Now, we own a $35 plastic salad bowl with a red base.The complete idiots who designed and approved this product on need to find a new line of work. As a result of this experience, I will never trust a Kitchen Aid product again."
1,Disappointment in a trusted brand name,"I have several KitchenAid products, which I am very pleased with, so when I was looking for a salad spinner at Kohl's, I went right for this one. The pump is awkward: when I pushed down on it, It would spin slightly then stop. I tried several times to use less pressure, but it would mostly either not spin at all or give a short spin then stop. Occasionally I'd get the right amount of force for the pump and got a god spin going, then realized I had to use more force than I expected (tiring my arm out) and I had to worry about pushing the pump down too far and hitting the brake. Too much effort is required for a product of this brand and price. After two weeks, it stopped spinning altogether!. This didn't function any better than the cheap one I bought at WalMart, that lasted much longer than this did. The only redeeming quality is that it ""looks nice."" Very frustrating and disappointing!"
1,I hope somebody at KitchenAid got fired over this,"My wife bought this thinking this would be an upgrade to the cheap spinner we were using at the time. I wish she had read some of the reviews here first.It was poorly engineered from the get-go. As other reviews point out, it doesn't come apart and as such is cumbersome to put in the dishwasher. Are you freakin kidding me? I'm sorry. I just don't think something like this should require hand washing in this day and age.Every time we used it, it got harder and harder to press the plunger that creates the spinning action. Finally, it stripped out when the necessary force was applied. It had only been used 20 or 30 times.KitchenAid used to make quality products. Maybe their appliances are still o.k. But for me, this experience has cast a pall over anything with the KitchenAid name attached to it."
1,Broke after a couple months,I think I maybe got 3 months use out of this POS before it stripped out. Didn't work very well even before that. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Read these other reviews!,"I can't add much that these other reviewers haven't already said, except buy the Oxo salad spinner instead of this. It never dried my salad satisfactorily, and broke after less than one year. There is too much plastic trash clogging our landfills to buy this crummy, worthless junk."
1,Total waste of money.,"I expected this tool to be as high quality as the other Kitchenaid items that I know and love. It lasted exactly one week and currently resides in the Trash Can outside my house. The sieve warped with a single washing, the the lid did not fit tightly to the bowl, the plunger had more parts than a German engineered sports car. It did not dry effectively, the plunger spindle was gross to handle, it was just a piece of p**. Waste of money, thank God I did not pay retail."
1,Really bad,"This thing is total joke. No wonder Costco had it with a instant rebate. Thought the KitchenAid name was the deal closer, turns out to be a waste of money. Just read the one star reviews here, there true."
1,Not worth the money and can cause injuries,"I felt I totally wasted my money on this product. As other reviewers had described, once you get the spinning mechanism going and you press down on the pump too much, it locks into place. The pump mechanism is also a bit hard to push down on. Mine eventually broke and I ended up injuring my wrist because it gave away when I was pressing down."
1,Worst Movie Ever!,"Honestly, this is the worst movie I have ever watched in my entire life. It is clearly a low budget film... a bunch of teenagers with a video camera. The acting was horrific and the plot was miserable. Actors/Actress' have the same clothes on each day, special effects or lack of special effects were pathetic. I could not watch this whole movie. The dialogue was ridiculousness. I believe my friends and I could make a better movie if I picked up a video camera and just started filming. Thank God I did not pay for this movie but even free it wasted my time."
1,this movie is sooooooooooooo boring I fell asleep watching it,the acting sucked the story was awfull bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad this is the worst movie ever made. Balla and Edward don't have nothing to worry about.
1,Absolutely terrible,"This film is definitely low budget. In the film, the main characters never changed clothing once, seemingly wearing the same clothes every day of the week. Acting was horrible, as was the plot and special effects. Don't waste your money."
1,Lawler Had Nothing To Say Worth Reading In the Book,"We read this in an honors Political Science class on Darwinism in politics.It was pretty universal that the entire premise of his argument was pure bologna. No one in the class, including the professor, thought his argument held any weight. It was a boring read and hard to get through once you realized Lawler was just blowing steam, which was pretty quickly.Larry Arnhart, who holds the opposite viewpoint, gave a much more convincing argument on the subject. The class much preferred his book over Lawler's. I would recommend his book over Lawler's any day, but if you want to compare the two, then go ahead and purchase this book. It'll just serve to reinforce Arnhart's statements."
1,Mislead?,"First they make it look like 2 books, but its only one short one. Second it was obviously made as a kids book but that's not mentioned in the info. So after that it was over-priced."
2,This is NO Dutch,"I was very apprehensive about this book because it didn't feel as gritty as Dutch, but I decided to read it anyway - BIG mistake. I found the book slow, the love scenes sappy, and overall extremely unbelievable. Why didn't they kill Princess?!! If you are thinking about buying this book because Dutch was good, don't do it. The best part was the first couple of pages, then the rest was just a waste of time."
3,Not what I expected from Teri............,"This was an ok book but it wasn't at all what I expected from Ms Woods. There were way too many characters which made me feel lost at times. I found myself far too often flipping back pages to see just who was who. I will read the next two books because I am curious to see what will happen to Grace, Dante and Damian. I would say if you want to read this borrow a friends or borrow from the library."
1,Is She Serious?????,"After reading Dutch by Teri Woods, I assumed all of her books would be great. This was a serious mistake on my part...It was totally horrible. The plots and the situations that took place were totally unbelievable. There were times when I literally was ready to throw the book out but I am one to read through the entire novel to give it a chance. I was disappointed in the author for this one. I wasn't sure if this was just a little something to pass the time before Dutch III came out but I personally feel like it should never have been written. The crazy thing is part two reads a little better, but not much. If you are thinking of buying thi sbook, save your money..Trust me.."
3,"Maybe a little unbelievable at times, but good overall","I did enjoy this book, I thought it was good. Not as good as True to the Game. It was more of a James Bonde mixed with a thug, Mofia type book. I'm sorry but the Agent, she cried way to much for me. Donte was a little unbelievable and so was Princess. These people were rich beyond our thoughts yet they were drug dealers."
4,Another good triology in the making!,"First let me say that I was mad this book was out before Dutch 3 was released! Come on Terry, we are all waiting for that conclusion!!!Anyway, this is the start of another good series. Lots of murder and madness going on. The siblings are off the hook with the way they treat each other! The undercover agent is just plain stupid for the way she acts sometimes. Not one of Terry's greatest, but it kept you interested enough to want to read Part 2 when that comes out. Dutch is definitely better, but she has 2 more parts to pack some punch some we'll have to wait and see."
3,Okay read,This book took me at least a week to fully read. It wasn't very interesting in the beginning and I had to skip over a lot of the things in the book because I felt it was dragging the story along and was not needed. All in all the book was okay and now I am really interested to find out what happends in the next book.
3,inmate,sent this book and many other TERI WOODS books to my brother in jail . all the inmates gave it high rateings . looking foward to her new book comming out in AUG 2009
3,Unbelievable..,Was it just me or was this book kind of James Bondish?? I couldn't really relate to the characters and some of the things done were unbeleivable. The plot was predictable at best and the story felt rushed. Don't get me wrong I LOVE anything with Terri Woods name on and she's the reason I spent way to much money on books(I need a second bookshelf!) this book to me was just not one of her greatest.
3,Pink Camo Shirt,Shirts are cut VERY small compared to other clothes and what the description doesn't say is that there is very little give in the material.
5,Writing = money,"OK, so you want to make a living writing. How you going to do it? Pen an award winning novel? Nope. Get that script you've been writing since high school turned into a movie? Maybe, but doubtful. How about freelance? Yes!This book is a little outdated which I found amusing but if you can over look this fact that computers and the internet have been around for a long time and not just discovered, you will find a treasure trove of information that is still very relevant. In fact replace the technologies mentioned in the book with the ones that have actually replaced them in life and everything still holds true. If you are not running a freelance business after reading this book, its your fault, plain and simple."
5,Had to have it,"I already have this one on vinyl, but I had to have the CD too cause its one of my favorite albums of all time"
3,Not bad,"Interesting...I like the hippie 70s influence, although it is a little mellow for my taste. Decent overall."
2,Poor quality screen.,This product has disappointed me because the screen keeps on shading over or distorting and even the tv image is distorted.Everything else seem to function properly for now but the product appears to be made with cheap plastic and I can't help but wonder how long it would last.
2,Returned It,We were not satisfied with this product. I purchased it for my daughter's 11th birthday. The mic didn't work and slight movement of the unit would cause CD's to skip. We returned it.
4,Good read,An interesting point of view about the race issues in 60's Mississippi. A girl from up North moving to the South with her FBI father during the start of integration.
3,Logits circa 1990,"I would have appreciated the (very solid) book more if Maddala hadn't published a book about limited-dependent-variable models back in 1983, and there'd been no progress in the field since then. It's 2006, and the book feels outdated and narrow in scope as an econometrics text. Oh, and it's just that: invoking marketing research in the title looks like a sales gimmick to me."
3,I really only listen to one song on this cd,I will be nice and give this cd 3 stars! It's really hard to review this cd when i only purchased it for one song!Anquette ( I will always be there for you) is a classic!
3,NOT a Belle & Sebastian cd... please know that!!,"On this release there is only one Belle & Sebastian song, which is sung in Portuguese (I believe), and it's not even a good tune in my opinion. All of the other tracks are hand-selected by B&S.; It is basically a mix cd. When I purchased my copy I was not aware that ""LateNightTales"" is a recurring series of ""mix cds"" put together by bands who are chart toppers in the UK.There might be some gems among the songs, but it's really all over the place in terms of genres and needless to say it was not what I expected.To conclude... I repeat, this is NOT a Belle & Sebastian cd. Go buy one of their full lengths, you cannot go wrong."
1,I Don't Quite Understand This Thing...,"I bought this with the car mount kit, so I could have XM in the car and wherever else I go. Figured, wow! This is a GREAT idea, all I have to do is buy a compatible portable device (because they say that in their advertisement) and no more dismounting a portable unit from my car and snapping it into a boombox. Now, all I'll have to do is plug in this card right? Wrong! Where are the compatible portable devices as advertised? Maybe I'm missing something here... Please correct me if I'm wrong. However, If I'm not wrong, then don't buy this if your looking for something to move from the car to a boombox because the technology isn't there!"
4,Great recipes but need experience,"This book contains the recipes for some of your favorite dishes fron CHA CHA CHA on Haight street in San Francisco. It would make a great basis for a tapas party! While nothing can beat the real thing, this book does a great job of giving you a headstart on creating your own home version of CHA CHA CHA. However, while these recipes are awesome, most are not for the novice cook. They work best for individual who have experience with the unique caribbean ingredients and experience with the cooking technigues (quick sauteeing with cream!)Overall...I would say that 1/3 of the recipes can be made by anyone...1/3 with a little experience and 1/3 by the dedicated gourment."
4,Good Book,"When I lived in Northern CA, I visited this restaurant in SF and loved it. The atmosphere, the sangria, the food. I bought this book as a special memory of my time there. The recipes were great but some of food items were very exotic and not easily found in a place outside of city."
5,This product work as advertised,"I use this video card in my media center. I wanted a ""quiet"" media center that had as few fans as possible. I have this connected to my LCD tv via a DVI to HDMI cable and it works very well. I wouldn't recommend this video card for intense video games or doing CAD graphics.I use this video card to watch Netflix On Demand, TV shows I've captured with my video capture cards, and to play DVDs. It may not be the best card out there, but it is silent and does what I want it to do for a good price. I've had it for over a year and have no complaints."
1,Only ONE movie is Digital Copy,"Very misleading product description - It clearly says (Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy), only one movie is with Digital Copy. My daughter mostly see this on her iPad, completely useless for me. I jumped onto this as it was on Gold Box, couldn't go through all the reviews. I would expect to see product description clearly stating the exact configuration - I shouldn't be expected to go through all reviews for this.This is going back to amazon right away - not sure how I'll explain the missing Jewelry box to my 3 year old :(I know the movies are excellent, but very disappointed with Amazon on this."
5,love the package,Having the chance to see the other two movies that follow Cinderella is wonderful. I love how the movies are all placed in between the pages and its easy to take it and put back in. My nieces loved watching all three movies. Also the Jewelry Box is so cute!
1,Faulty Blu Ray,Beware. The Blu Ray discs being sent out are faulty. This one did not play in my Blu ray player without pixelization and skipping and jumping chapters while playing. Very disappointed in this product. DIsney pumps these out with no checking of the discs. Now my daughter has present that she cannot enjoy without ME having to send it back for probably another faulty product.
2,"Digital version still requires CD/DVD drive on your computer, and jewelry box is lame","I was looking forward to being able to play the digital version on various things in the house (computer, roku, etc.) But only the original movie is digital, the other 2 are still DVDs. And you have to have a computer with a CD/DVD drive. I have a macbook air, so no disk drive. Disney's own FAQs say ""you can buy one"" [...] Well why would I buy one and get the digital copy? If I had a DVD drive, I'd just rip the DVD! This is why people pirate! And still out of touch studios do nothing to make it easier to purchase things legitimately.The jewelry box is ok, but just reinforced cardboard, very cheap and drawers don't open and close easily. Was hoping for something a little more quality and substantial for my daughter"
5,Great first jewelry box!,"I bought this as a gift for my niece for her birthday and she loves it! I was slightly disappointed it didn't come with any jewelry, but I remedied that problem by filling it with play jewelry. It was her favorite birthday present!"
4,Nice collection,"What can I say? Disney blu rays are flawless. The extras are plentiful and the PQ and AQ are outstanding, as expected."
4,2nd watch,"awesome story, characterizations and description. Grabs you and doesn't let you go until the end... thanks!"
4,"Heat rises, removes heat from top of case.","I purchased the Startech 5.25'' Drive bay Fan about a year and a half ago. Since then I have moved it into 3 different PC's I have built and have had good results overall.The fan air-intake is located on the top of the unit, so the best placement of this unit is ABOVE your media drives. The hot air in the case wants to rise toward the top of the unit, which is why mounting it toward the top will help keep your case cool.If you have a large enough case, the air-intake/fan actually can be slid out of the unit to make the intake move toward the center of your case.Overall quality of the product is 3 stars, as it seems to be made of mid-quality plastic. However, I give it 5 stars for air flow and cooling capabilities, as it works quite well, and moves lots of air.Would be nice if it had a 3 pin connector, but it instead use a 4 pin 12V with no monitoring wire. Works fine."
1,great ideal but vary poorly made,do not buy this item.its a great ideal but vary poorly made.dont work well at all and vary load.it looks well and easy to hook up but thats all.
4,Didn't get the Credit it deserved.,"This 1990 release is a concept album that deals with the day in the life of a black community activist Lakim. Most of the songs are separated by spoken interludes that build up a picture of the man, and his mission, and the struggle he faces. Blaze were/are predominantly a garage band, and thus the first five songs leave me a little bit cold. Blazes wear their influences broadly on their sleeves, which might be a good or bad thing, according to your point of view. Thus you have Curtis Mayfield,(Lover Man)Stevie Wonder(All That I Should Know), Donnie Hathaway/Marvin Gaye(I Wonder) sounding tracks. This was woefully overlooked at the time, as Motown was going through a hard time in the 90s, and to my mind did not promote this excellent CD. Get this before its deleted."
2,Wrong size arrived,"When I ordered this, I was guaranteed fitment on a Toyota 3S-FE engine. When it arrived, it was not the correct size. i left two stars because I did run out and buy the correct size from another store, however, I didnt want to have to do this when I had all the rest of my parts shipped in."
5,"excellent filter, great performance","K&N; has done their homework.I drive a race car and could not find a filter of any kind that would keep the inside of the valve covers clean,what I mean is : I used every kind of filter available for a small block Chevy and all of them would leave a oily foam inside the covers.I always feared this meant the water was somehow getting in to the oil.I purchased a K&N; filter on a fiend's reccomendation and it completely cured the problems 100%.This makes me a believer, ALL my cars and motocycles now get K&N; filters.It is a purchase you will not regret!!!!"
4,K&N vs Mobil vs Bosch-Distance-Plus,"If you are do-it-yourselfer, K&N is most convenient (nut to remove, mark to rotate the last 3/4 turn). If you are a racing enthusiast, Mobil can withstand the max pressure (615 psi, Bosch 500 psi) whereas K&N allows max oil flow (less efficient filtration). If you are interested in changing filter as late as possible, Bosch holds the max contaminants (29.1g, Mobil 28g). If you want max engine protection, Bosch is 99.9% efficient (Mobil 99.2%, and K&N less efficient to increase oil flow)"
5,Fast Delivery,I've been using K & N Oil and Air Filter for my Toyota 4runner and I am found it's cheaper to purchase this at amazon.They came in fast and I will recomend them to everyone..
5,K&N Oil Fitler,"Hello all,It is the best oil filter money can buy. Amazon has the best prices if you compared to local auto stores.I only uses K&N; oil filters on all my cars and trucks. You can't go wrong with it when it comes to engine protection."
3,Oil filter,"I haven't used it yet,but who really knows how good any oil filter is,K/N makes a great air filter,so I figured this would be of same quality"
3,so far so good,i was happy with the service and condition of the the filter it fit perfect we will see
2,CD issue gives bad impression,"It would have been wonderful if this marvelous album had been re-mastered and correctly tracked by the Fallout label. There are only 18 tracks - not 20 as listed on the liner. From the original LP, the song ""Vincent Van Gogh"" is clearly missing, and I don't know what else. As to the sound quality, any amateur could have transferred the LP with better results. It is sad that the high calibre of Callender's talent is so poorly represented on this CD."
4,It's a Chilton - and it's got the info needed,I ordered this book for a friends car so far it has more than paid for itself in time and parts savings.
2,Terrible Video Transfer,"It was nice to watch the series again. Way back when, I saw the second series first. So with this video set, I am able to start at the beginning, which makes for a better experience. What is not better, though, is the video quality. It is the poorest DVD I have ever seen. Think of recording snowy PBS stations over the air, and you get the idea. Outdoor scenes suffer the worst from snow, dark images, and general fuzziness. It's like someone took a poor-quality VHS dub from the 1970s, and merely transferred the video without any effort to improve things. What an embarassment to an otherwise classic story."
5,great to see the series again,Saw the series the first time on PBS 35 years ago. It has lost nothing over time. The characters are great. We are looking forward to the release of season 2 in September of 2010
5,5 STAR,"This is an excellent transfer to DVD. The quality is great and makes me want to watch it again since I have watched it for the 3/4 times on VHS. The story is exceptional. The author, Winston Graham's friends said they thought the Angared Rees character Demelza was based on his wife. He denied it.([...]) Winston Graham is also the author of a number of films including Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie. Winston Graham personally picked Sean Connery to play the male lead in Marnie. That was before Sean became James Bond.This DVD is, in my opinion, highly entertaining and highly recommended."
2,A voice in the wilderness,"All the rave reviews, one even called this hodgepodge ""The British Gone with the Wind"". If this is so then the Shondells are the American Beetles. I probably made the mistake of watching the Poldark disaster after ""The Dutchess of Duke Street"" and ""Upstairs Downstaires"", two truely great productions. Poldark is not well written nor is it well constructed. Consiquently, the acting suffers. I must be the only one who is turned off, I'm certainly not getting in line for Series II.Denis Wright (I have no catchy reviewer name)"
4,Poldark Series 1,"Enjoyable good versus evil series. Despite the sound being very uneven, it was like a good book that you can't put down!"
5,"Poldark, Series 1",I can hardly believe it!!! I have been waiting for this series on DVD for so long. I still have all the VHS versions but they're getting pretty worn by this time and I'm really looking forward to that beautiful Cornwall scenery in DVD to say nothing of the story itself.Thank you and kudos to whoever finally OK'd producing this in USA format on DVD
4,Over the Moon,Poldark kept me riveted to my PBS station every Sunday evening decades ago. Being able to order this series on DVD is an absolute delight.My order was filled quickly and the quality is as good as I could expect for a 1970s series. I'm considering ordering Series II. Thank you.
3,Just as confused as the other reviewers,"Did DJ Shadow create this album to show how easy it is to make mainstream hiphop? It sounds like he listened to a lot of Outkast and Kanye West and said to himself, ""Hey, I could make an album of that stuff in a week or two!"" A couple of tracks are good, but the rest is average mainstream hiphop."
2,Creativity can't save mediocrity,"E.A. Salinas' review sums up my thoughts on Shadow's latest release perfectly, although I think there are a couple redeeming tracks: This Time and Enuff.I have been a Shadow fan for years, eagerly anticipating every release. I even bought tickets for the show here in Dallas this weekend before this album had dropped (or leaked). When it did, I eagerly put it on, looking forward to introducing my girlfriend to Shadow and give her a taste of what we were in for in person.All I can say is I hope he draws on older material when he performs live, because this album is a wreck, an effort to take a lot of mediocre rappers and beats and make them sound original and impressive. Shadow's done it before, but not this time."
2,Disappointment,"I already heard it on the promo, but decided to buy it anyway, just to complete the collection. I'm also a big fan of all his previous albums but this album contains to many cheap rap and mainstream beats."
1,When does the new RJD2 album come out?,"It would be pointless for me to ramble about the hyphy music and general disarray of this album, as every reviewer before and after me will make the same points. OK, I'm gonna make one comment... DJ Shadow made an album that aims to simultaneously please fans of Lil Jon and Portishead. Even though both utilize turntables, I don't think there are many people in this world that would list these 2 artists in their top five. But that's fine... Itunes will sell you just the 3 songs that you'll actually like!Anyway, I just wanted to give it one star in an effort to lower the average score even further."
2,disappointing,"i agree with most of the negative reviews here, and what bothers me the most is that those who do particularly enjoy this album feel the need to reply to every negative response as if they (or he, mr not your concern in this case) are going to be able to change each and every negative opinion.there are a few listenable tracks, nothing as creative as endtroducing or even private press, but the rap just sucks. (and i'm listening to an aesop/prefuse track right now) shadow, what happened? drugs? did it all go to your head? (understandable if true) if you just needed money to compensate for all of the pirating of your previous work, so be it... i'm still disappointed though."
1,"A miss, not a hit","This album is a risk, for sure. Some may like it. I didn't. Hoestly, I couldn't make it through a single track without skipping ahead. The deep deeps and crunchy atomsphere of his previous albums are gone. While there are some interesting beats and sounds on this album, you can't really hear them because of all the awful rapping that seems to be the highligh of this whole album. Bottom line: too much bad rapping, too little Dj Shadow."
1,"This ""album"" makes my life hurt.",Exactly how much crack did Dj Shadow have to smoke to release this album with his name on it?
1,Envy the deaf.,"If deaf people have anything going for them, it's that they will never ever have to listen to this abortion of an album. I have no idea what happened to DJ Shadow, but this album sounds like Lil Jon raped him with the Crunk Cup. Shadow must have composed this album between bathroom breaks while suffering from chronic diarrhea, there is a real lack of effort. I am actually so dumbfounded by this production that I probably would've gotten more value from my money by actually buying a bag of fecal matter."
1,absolute pants,"shadow what happened you? this is the worst record i have heard in a long time. to paraphrase your own song ""hip-hop sucks in 06"". i cant believe how bad this is compared to endtroducing, private press, brainfreeze, product placement etc. doesnt even deserve 1 star"
1,complete garbage,"so dj shadow thinks he appeals to the masses in his small culture with his incredibly immature tunes here. that's fine, but please don't use your name to try to sell albums all over the world. he is prostituting himself i believe. stop it. it is embarassing. do not buy this album if you like music. i will never buy a dj shadow album again."
5,"""she approached me with a smirk""","as usual, shadow is money yet eludes many listeners. this is a real style of fusion that shows mastery and eclecticism."
1,Horrible!,"I was extremely skeptical when I first read that DJ Shadow and E-40 were making a track together. This album is just bad, but luckily for DJ Shadow he gets a pass this time because Endtroducing, the Private Press, etc are CLASSICS."
2,Defying what he does best,"2 1/2This album caused a collective ""What the ??"" upon release, but in retrospect seemed an obvious step from an already semi-turgid PP. It wasn't so much Shadow's insistence on attempting to emulate booty beats and other undercooked genre attempts then an insistence and seemingly almost bitter refusal to further progress familiar elements and energize this limp dish, instead proving severely his limitations under this superficial guise of artistic change, if slipping out a few genuinely elevated hip-hoppers and partially outstretched instrumentals."
2,"Call me conservative, i just don't dig this","Can the people who give out 5stars stop attacking people who give out 1 or 2 stars? OK we don't understand, we're conservative, we're ""afraid to try new things"" (Which makes it quite strange that we're digging Shadow in the 1st place), but we have a right to voice out. And sometimes experiments do go wrong. The only thing i'd say is that Shadow did something different this time around, and I am not a fan of it. There are millions of rap albums I can choose from, but there was only one DJ Shadow."
1,Why Hip-Hop Sucks In '06,"I don't usually write reviews, but I want to warn every fan out there. This is garbage. Maybe a couple of ok songs, but this is not the shadow that I have grown to love over the past 10 years. It seems like a sellout, but a complete sellout would have better songs. Josh is lost."
1,Good thing I listened before I bought...,"Oh boy, what a stinker. So you go and follow up a brilliant cd in ""Entroducing"" and almost as good ""Private Press"" with this? If you love those cd's and do not want a cheesy sounding rap, electronic, with uneccesary guest artists cd, then stay away from this one. Hopefully he'll get back to what made ""Entroducing"" great and this will be just a hickup in the discography. Yikes."
1,Wow,"I read the reviews and thought it couldn't be that bad. It really is, what a load of rubbish. Enough said."
4,typical shadow,"a well made up albulm by shadow.a little sublime,mystical,and dark but hey what would you expect?"
1,Sadly disappointed,"I purchased this album with such high hopes and when I popped it in to give it a listen, I was sadly disappointed. It was not the DJ Shadow that I knew. The majority of the tracks were rap, which would have been just fine if it had been GOOD rap. It had no flow, no connection and was all over the place. I took a risk and purchased this album without looking at the reviews and I'm sorry I did. Always read the reviews!!!!!"
2,"Okay, here we go...","The rap tracks are fun, but with varying degrees of quality. ""Seein' Thangs"" is awesome; ""Keep 'Em Close"", not so much. Everything that is NOT rap is not worth listening to. It's that simple."
1,Why hip hop sucks in 2006,"Am I confused here? Did I just give DJ Shadow 1 star?I sure did. I am not a ""I like your old stuff better than your new stuff"" zealot, but I have my limits. This is just terrible, piss-weak crunk trash. I really dont have anything else to say about this other than thank god that I can still turn to Diplo and RJD2 to help me forget i heard this.Please DJ Shadow - come back to us and ditch this daarrrty soouuth crap!"
1,I'm so sad,I cannot put into words how sad this makes me. I have so much history listening to shadow.....and now this. Please don't do this again. Please
2,Not good!,"after listening to the 'Outsider', makes me wonder whether 'Entroducing' was really his effort. I am not that smart to understand any creative direction he was trying to undertake while making this album nor am i a huge fan of his work. But i have listened to it in full.Its very bad, the production was not upto par and i just could not feel the songs. For now, its still entroducing...."
1,GARBAGE,"Pretentious soundscapes & terrible rhymes.Instrumentals sound like Enya, the rhymes sound like Fred Durst.Shadow must haves: Entroducing, Preemptive Strike, UNKLE-Psyence Fiction.If you like beats-buy these albums.If you're a hipster-buy The Outsider."
3,"Different, and not in a good way","I'd expected something different from DJ Shadow and The Outsider is different. I bought the first two singles on iTunes and then decided I'd buy the whole CD. Unfortunately, at least for me, the two singles where the bright spot of an otherwise scattershot album. If you are a fan of Entroducing or The Private Press, take the time to listen to all the song previews here before you buy. I found this album disorganized and not playing to Shadow's strengths as a turntablist, and the forays into rap simply didn't work for me."
1,New direction,Shadow said he was going in a new direction but this is more like he ran off the road and hit a tree. There is no creativity to this new work. It's lacking a soul. The beats are lame at best. I love all of his music up to this point. Hopefully his next album will not sound anything like this.
1,Worst CD ever,"imagine the worst cd ever made and then call it the outsider. Most djs who make innovative hip-hop electonic music usually team up with underground hardcore hip hop emcees like atmosphere or blueprint but i have to give it to DJ Shadow for reaching out to the untapped Dirty South Crunk rappers also known as the most talentless collection of humans ever assembled. You know what scratch everything I just said all you need to know is he does a track with David Banner. If that doesnt tell you everything you need to know then this cd was made for you. I wont be surprised to hear ""turf dancing"" on the radio soon. Worst worst ever worsted."
3,Careful it is a LOW PROFILE card!,"The Startech Parallel LOW PROFILE card works great in Windows XP: no conflicts, easy install, and works transparently. However, the card does NOT ship with XP drivers, they must be downloaded from the Startech.com website. Also, I did not know that ""Low Profile"" referred to the size of the back-plane mounting bracket. Careful, this means that this card will NOT fit in standard case slots that are in more than 90% of all computers made. Luckily, I found a full-length bracket with the correct opening for a parallet port in my computer boneyard and was up and running in no time."
1,computer wouldn't stop re-booting after install.,"I put the card in, installed the drivers and then it didn't do anything. Then I reset my computer... computer would not boot up again until the card was removed. Tried all sorts of remedies to try to resolve the problem, never worked. ALSO the card I was sent did not look like the one pictured. It had purple where the picture is black and also there was two notches in the connectors instead of the one pictured here."
3,Good materials for teaching history,This book series is an excellent tool for teaching history using the book series History of US.
4,Good information,"Explains most things.Author does a great job.Got it to better understand, and possiblydiscuss the subject matter with others."
3,It's just OK,"On one hand, this book was a very boring read in the sense that it just dragged on and on. On the other hand, it seemed pretty informative about alot of issues that arise from the choice to be a crossdresser or trannie. It does seem, however that the author touches on a very important ellement: HOW to be supportive of your spouse, whether you are the wife or the CDing husband. She manages to point out that there are many other much worse things in life to be upset over than this type of lifestyle. Once was enough for me to read but I'm glad I did."
1,"My Husband Betty: Love, Sex, and Life with a Crossdresser","Boring attempt at being a therapist quoting real professionals and sharing exactly nothing about Betty other than very superficial descriptions. No pictures or real personal feelings from Betty, except a vapid paragraph at the end."
3,50 ohm antenna/cables will not work well with 75 ohm boosters,"50 ohm antenna/cables will not work well with 75 ohm boosters... 50 ohm antenna equipment generally uses the N-type or TNC connectors while the 75 ohm antenna equipment generally uses the F-type (think cable tv) connectors. also, if the 50 ohm antenna / 75 ohm booster combo works at all, it will probably be significantly degraded due to standing waves caused by reflections from impedance mismatch. in some cases, these reflections may even damage the signal booster amplifier. lookup those terms in wikipedia for more info."
1,Not worth the money,"I replaced the antenna that came with my cell phone extender with this antenna because they said it would be significantly better. Not only is it no better, I ended up spending another $20 on connectors to get it to work and wasted 3 weeks finding those. If I felt like taking it off the roof I'd send it back."
3,figuring out how to connect to it..,Haven't tried the antenna yet.. still figuring out how to connect the N-Female jack to a coax cable...
3,Not what I expected...,"I looked forward to reading this book, but was disappointed with the ending. Ms. Landorf's biblical beliefs and mine greatly differ. I was going to give this book to my sister, but won't do it now. I am saddened that I spent money on this book."
5,One of the most interesting stories I've ever read!,"I read many of the anthropological books on the ""Yanoama"" (uncommon spelling used in book) first but I learned more from this book than all the rest put together. She just tells her story, in great detail, and all the emotion and humanity comes out in the story. The people come across as individual people, not a monolithic species to be observed and catalogued in an anthropological zoo.It takes some time to get through and I never did keep track of which tribe was which and who's trying to kill whom, but you really feel for her and she really brings you into her world. Why this isn't #1 on the Yanamami reading list, or Amazon tribe reading list for that matter, is beyond me. It's maybe the most fascinating biography I've ever read."
2,Raised-by-Indians story lacks drama and perspective,Disappointing as-told-to-account by Portuguese woman kidnapped as a child by Yanomami and raised to adulthood. She tells us what happened but gives us no hint of her own feelings and no perspective that helps us understand the motives of the Indians.
2,Doesn't quite fit,I ordered this for my Chevy C1500 and it leaks around the fittings. If you order this you're going to need an additional fitting because the flair at the end doesn't quite work with the stock hard lines. Your local performance auto shop should be able to help you out.
2,Quite disappointed,"Well, there are not so many DVDs out there showing these hot police chases. This is why I wanted to try this one.Well, don't be fooled by the title. This video IS censored. Not by some Parental Association, but by the producers themselves.Language is like the usuall ""You son of a -beeeeeep- ""! And there is a scene where a poor fellow kills himself which is blurred. But honestly, on that footage, the most shocking is not the gunshot to his head, but the reaction of the police who stood at a safe 150 feet away with guns ready and watched the guy get out of the car with his shotgun, open the trunk, load the shotgun and then shoot himself...Also the comments on each videos are not good quality: ""let's watch this part again"" Sometimes, they start a pursuit and then jump straight to the end when the car is already on the roof.And where is that tank they show in the preview?"
3,"Nice book, but looks like a cheap black & white reprint","The book is nice in terms of content and presentation, well illustrated with good tips and detail. I am very much into Euopean HO modeling therefore found the book interesting.I was dissappointed because there is not a single color illustration and the enrite book is black & white which represents a rather cheap reproduction of the excellent content, by the publishing company for the price of the book."
1,A dog of a book; a huge disappointment,"Perhaps I expected too much from this book. I had thought it would be a valuable reference for anyone who appreciates television and its history. Instead, the book is aimless drivel about nothing but the author's own opinions, not to mention his revolting and juvenile puns, appearing seeminly on every other line."
1,Typos and forced humor,"At first blush, in the bookstore, this seemed like a great book--but the typos in chapter 2 are infuriating! For example: on page 15 of 2003 edition you travel 15 miles in 3.0 minutes and their answer is 30 miles an hour! Nooooo!!!! Please, this is supposed to help idiots--not be written and proofread by idiots... This is very sloppy publishing and it cannot be tolerated!A few pages later, the reader is treated to a defintion of acceleration in which a crucial symbol is completely missing.If not for the typos I would have overlooked the forced enthusiasm in the preamble to the discussion on dimensional analysis, but ""All right. Hold on to your hats. Here goes!"" begins to annoy one after wasting too much time finding their typos...This is my first Idiots Guide, and it will likely be my last! Shame on the Penguin Group, the parent company!"
2,Don't Get It Unless You Want To Become An Idiot...,"What seemed like a good book in the bookstore turned out to be a disaster. I am a sophmore student in high school and I barely passed physics with a 70 last semester.Don't get this book. It is so annoying. (Sorry to the author in case he is reading this), but this book doesn't help at all. He basically repeats the same information five different ways. All we need to do is hear it once.I am a huge idiot's guide fan. Most idiot's guides authors have enormous passions with what they are talking about. However, Johnnie does not have a passion at all in his writing. No inspiration to the reader to want to learn the material.Instead of just telling us the formula for universal gravitation, tell us also why we need it. Why it is important.If you can handle the constant repition than go ahead and read it, but it will take a lot of effort to dig through it.-Jeff"
1,I'm sorry I bought it,"I'm not an idiot, but I'm willing to be humbled by a subject in order to learn.I'm not even through two chapters and I simply don't understand what the hell I'm doing yet. I sincerely hope the Physics for Dummies book is better. This is a painful book to have and I don't even want to give it one star."
1,Waste of time and money!!,"I think the only reason why this book has a few good reviews must be because the authors themselves wrote them. The book was decent until about the 3rd or 4th chapter. There were many mistakes in the calculations which made it hard to learn. Was I wrong or was the book wrong? I don't know because the appendix only comes with (sometimes incorrect) answers and not explanations! This book also has a few formulas that were either a) incorrectly followed by the author or b) very complicated with steps that are not obvious THAT THE AUTHOR SHOULD HAVE EXPLAINED. Seriously, the book is called The Complete Idiot's Guide to Physics. The author should assume that the reader knows very little about the subject. Don't buy this book. Borrow it from the library and take it back when you get to the part where the authors got tired of writing (ch3-4)."
3,Decent Book,"Book is not as easy at it promotes itself. Explanations are few, and a lot of background info in just not there. It helps, but now what I expected."
1,Awful if you plan on learning anything.,"I am a senior in college, obtaining a degree that is not science related. Because of the school's requirements, I had to take a specific science class, and the instructor chose this book.I have no prior Physics knowledge, and halfway through a semester, I am about where I started. This book is horrible. There is so much that is just not explained, figures that are out of scale, and answers in the back that are flat out WRONG!! (How can 6 x 5 = 24??)My instructor was attempting to save us money, but instead caused us all MASSIVE headaches with this pathetic excuse for an instructional book."
4,A Great Review of Highschool Physics,"I have to admit to having nearly failed physics in highschool on account of breaking so much lab equipment. Mr. Dennis' book was a great review of classic physics without the hazards of flying hockey pucks off the airtable(breaking the poloroid camera) or squirting latex emulsion into the microscope(permanently jamming the focusing mechanism). I would have liked a section on some of the newer ideas such as string theory and dark matter, but the book was a thoroughly enjoyable review of the Newtonian science of movement"
2,Cheap-y...,"This recliner is NOT meant for a big person. If you are small (under 5'5"" and 130 lbs.) then you may fit nicely. The material is a thin plastic-like covering and my cat's nails went right through. This chair is basically a reclining desk chair and looks cheap. The price is too high for this quality."
2,Bought 2 of these swivel recliners,"We bought 2 of these swivel recliners for our newly renovated family room. We liked the fact that we could use them to watch TV and if we had company could swivel around to the rest of the family room and join the conversation.However, the design of the base is questionable in that there are only 4 spot welds holding the shaft holder in place to the base. In less than 1 year one of the chairs has already failed exactly at this design flaw. Had the company welded around the entire bracket this would not have happened.For the price I suppose it is a bargain but not if you have to replace furniture within a year. Would I buy another? Yes I believe I would however, I would have a welder run a bead weld completely around the base making it a sturdier product and last much longer.Bob"
2,Substandard recliner,"Chair material was thin and recliner very uncomfortable, after a while, felt like sitting on cardboard. Mechanism was hard to recline and took two hands. Could not dismantle to return, company was of no help. Stuck with cheap chair."
4,Swivel Recliner Lounge Chair,"Chair was fairly easy to assemble. Fabric seems to be fairly thin so if you have cats, this could easily be torn. We bought 4 chairs (mainly for our kids ages 12-15)for our theater room and they should fit in well. I'm very happy with the features and if needed should be fairly easy to recover. Padding is a little skimppy but is still comfortable enough to sit through a long movie. Over all pretty happy with my purchase. I paid a total of ~$180/chair which included shipping."
2,Made in China. Made for Small people,"I'm only 6' tall and my arms don't even reach the arm rests. The foot rest hits me on the back of my calves and is very uncomfortable. The reclining mechanism has to be fought. The chair rests loosly on a 2"" diameter swivel point and therefore has an unfortunate tendancy to wobble in all directions. The selling company does not offer the origin of manufacture. I guess they know how poorly manufactured this chair is and choose to deliberately hide the manufacturer. To suggest the retail listing of this chair is $558.00 also suggests fraud from this seller. It's barely worth the money I paid, but with the very high shipping cost I paid, I feel I got taken."
4,A genuine bargain,"It arrived, in good condition, in several pieces, including the tools needed to put them all together. Assembly is not difficult: It took me the better part of an hour. The chair looks like a piece of furniture from the star ship Enterprise, but I like it. It is very comfortable and if the upholstry is as rugged as the frame and leg-rest mechanism it should last forever. I have no idea how to judge the durability of the covering, but I think it will be with me for a long while. I have another recliner, that cost five times as much as the -999, that I prefer for naping, but the -999 is the one I like best for watching movies. Reading is equally comfortable in both."
5,Very happy customer!,"I was very impressed with the packaging,and timley service!They made it very easy on me!Excellent service!I would buy from them again and also reccomend to others!thank you!"
3,Fair purchase,I bought the chair for my mother who has arthritis. It is high enough for her to get out of but the handle for reclining is too hard for her to use. I like the price and it is a fair bargain. Not too good though for heavy use. It was easy to put together and I can disinfect it using bleach daily and it hasn't faded yet.
1,what dissapoint,"do no buy this item. the pictures looks better than it is.I received whith missing parts, and the seller even do not try to help me.I lost my money."
1,Terrible chair -- broke within three months!,"This is a horrible chair that broke within three months. The back of the chair won't sit up unless it's propped up against the wall. The handle to flip the legs up and out is nearly impossible to move (and, in fact, it IS impossible for me to move) and only my husband can work the lever. The recline feature is hit or miss -- it seems there is no happy medium between lying flat or sitting straight (propped against a wall). The return policy is for two month on this product; our chair broke at three months, so we are out of luck with help. Now we are the proud owners of a broken chair. Yippy!"
1,Junk,"Poor build quality, awkward ergonomics -save your money. Unless you're over six two, your feet won't even touch the floor with the foot rest closed. It only opens to one, fully extended position. Very difficult to extend the foot rest. The shape is more like a car seat, meaning that you can't just lean your head back - you'll need a pillow to be comfortable. Better to save your money a bit longer and buy a real recliner from a reputablee manufacturer."
3,Enjoyed it for the first 2 months!!!!!,"When we bought this it was great comfortable and relxing.. But after few months it started to squeak everytime we sat in it or moved around while in it. It made so much noise, we even tried DW40 but did not help... We ended up giving it away especially with a new baby in the house."
2,Overpriced Cheap Chair For A SHORT Person,"The backrest is not ergonomic; a pillow is necessary for spinal support. ""Leatherette"" means a thin, cheap viny-ish fabric. The armrests are low. I am 6' tall, and with the footrest extended, the end of it is at mid-calf, and it is at a noticably downward angle/slant. When fully reclined, the footrest is still at the same point on my calf. The footrest requires a Lot of force to extend, so much so that I have taken to just leaving it extended and straddling the chair in order to sit down in it. A long bolt was included with which to secure the plastic handle to the extension rod, but the bolt would not screw in to secure it. It was difficult to assemble due to alignment issues, and there were not actually that many bolts. It is basically an office type chair that reclines, and I would not purchase this item again."
1,cheapy,"I just bought the chair and delivered today, so disappointed. Cheap material and it is not friendly user for the operation for this price. Don't waste your money."
2,Had problems putting the chair together. Finally had to use a smaller bolt to line up seat.,Back is short and not high enough for my 6 foot plus husband.Lever to raise foot rest is very hard to use.Carton was heavily damaged. The chair arrived on the day posted.
1,Leatherette Recliner,Very bad. Will never buy it . The recoiler does not work.I had great difficulty putting it together. I had to spend slot of money to have somebody come and put it together . Even then the handle was so stiff that I could not even move it.
4,comfy gaming,"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. He spends long hours at the computer gaming and needed a more comfortable chair to sit in. The package arrived looking worse for the wear but everything inside was intact. I lugged everything out to put together and it fought me the whole way. It took me awhile to force everything to line up so I could get all the screws in place but I eventually got it assembled. The fabric, ""leatherette"" of the chair leaves something to be desired. It feels fragile and cheap. The only thing keeping this review at 4 stars right now is that my boyfriend finds it comfortable and loves that he can recline at any angle. He likes having a footrest too. As long as he likes it I'm happy.Update 06/10/12He's still loving the chair! I'd suggest putting something underneath the base if you have wood floors because it can scratch them up."
3,Didn't work for what I needed it for...,"I bought this for the Sony Shower CD/Radio which uses a 6v adapter, but for some reason this Multi Adapter did not work with it. I ended up buying a different adapter that is 6v ONLY that did work. This adapter did work for other things."
1,Stay away from Teaching Systems,Teaching Systems AND Standard Deviants sell the SAME product with different labels on them to confuse and rip the customers -- Amazon encourages them this is really strange and keeping the customers in the dark always and customers are the losers as alwaysStay away from TEACHING SYSTEMS
2,An Okay Introduction,"An okay introduction to the genre, with some of the originators but too many of the copycats. Artists like Anthony Ausgang and The Pizz have been trying for years to be well known lowbrow artists, which they have achieved, but with zero originality or technique. The scene is plagued with imitators and most gallerists or anthologists don't seem to sift them out. The Juxtapoz and Hi-Fructose collections are probably better."
4,bonus tracks,"this one has two more tracks than the european version : ""dimm the lights"" and ""vultures""."
2,Very dated,"This is one of the few recordings available of A. Scarlatti's Passion. It is very dated - although the CD date is 1998, the original recording is from the 70's. And it sounds like it. The solists' voices have a nice quality, but unfortunately their vibrato is so overbearing I have a hard time listening to it. The tenor soloist is particularly bad in this regard. The instruments have a somewhat heavy sound to them, so I wonder if they are modern rather than historical. For anyone like myself who has been spoiled by listening to great early music ensembles of the last couple of decades, this recording won't fit the bill. It could serve as a reference since this doesn't seem to be a well-recorded piece, but not one I'll be listening to very often."
3,"It is what it is, and what you'd expect","This is a quick little book by and about a legend of the West. But he, like P.T. Barnham, was a consummate self-promoter. This book contains his most popular tales about his favorite subject, himself. Some of the stories are almost impossible, some have proven to be highly exaggerated, or worse. But the book is, at the least entertaining. It is a look at an idealized frontier, the contradictory attitudes toward Native Americans, and the recollections of a man who saw much, just not as much as he claimed."
5,as promised,I would definitely buy form this seller again if the need ever arose for some thing that this seller sold
5,An Autobiography of Buffalo Bill (Colonel W. F. Cody),I couldn't believe a free book would be so entertaining and enlightening. Bill learnt over the years of the worth of the Indians and it must've played on his mind. He was a good person but a person of the times and culture. Times that will never be again. I couldn't put this one down.
5,Buffalo Bill,Great book !!! You feel like you are there with Buffalo Bill and got to know more about his family.
2,average,"Nothing really stands out on this record. Pretty standard, heavy music. It is somewhat trance-like when you lay back and have a listen. Not too impressed with this one, although not ""bad"" per Se, it was just a boring album."
4,"alright book, not very helpful",It used a lot of pages to go through grammar problems which there are many other excellent books to address. It is not very in depth on scientific specific topics. Good for beginners maybe.
5,A good writing guide,"This book is a excellent writing guide for scientific writing. In my option, it is especially useful for students whose major is biology or chemistry and the Chinese students. I guess the reason is that the author is originally from China, and his background is related with chemistry and some other areas."
4,Couldn't wait for every page,I really loved the book. I think it should of gone into more detail with the character's backgrounds and lives. I felt like this was a book report on a much longer novel.
1,Agree w/Taxton: Gerardi's book blows up in author's face,"Must say I agree with Gene Taxton. Gerardi's lack of knowledge about firearms makes the book fall apart at key juncture. I disagree with the Australian lady. She misses Taxton's point entirely. How does she so keenly know what the author knows, and does not know? All we have is the text. The text clearly shows how little Gerardi knows about that which he is writing. He has never been to Africa and never fired a Wembley, and as Mr. Taxton so rightly puts it, who in God's name would seek out a Wembley in our time? This book reads like a ""This Boy's Life"" adapted by someone who grew up fantasizing on National Geographic magazine issues. By the way, where's the second edition of any of Gerardi's books? Nowhere. Quite."
5,Modern-day piracy mixed with an aura of the 16th century,"I've never heard about pirates with a notebook connected by wire to databases around the world when they are about to make their victims ""jump the plank"" the old fashioned way! But, .... I can imagine it after reading this book! The author manage to mix the modern-day life and technology together with the feeling of the old era centuries ago when the black-eyed pirates sailed the seven seas! I'm already looking for Mr. Girardis next book. With this kind of writing it has to be great!!!!"
1,Stay away from this book.,"There aren't any answers in this book, just some feel-good aphorisms. If that's all it takes to make you feel better, so be it. If you're looking for some real answers or insights, this book won't help."
1,Author still needs a good anti-psychotic.,"Emmanuel is still jabbering away and Pat is still writing it all down.Just hear Emmanuel talking and you'll see: How often you arrange your lives to accommodate easy answers rather than to accept some hard facts. The disappointment and frustrations of your lives are facts you must deal with, not write off by saying ""My spirit meant that to happen."" The altar built to the worship of trite cliches is not the place humanity must go to worship. But rather place faith in the truth of life's difficulties which are not solved, or even addressed, by bits and pieces stolen from legitimate religions. For I have no idea whether you are trustworthy and believing the Universe is loving is an exercise in self-deception. I hope you despise all the Emmanuel's books as much as I do!"
5,Another Opinion,"For what it's worth I have spent most of my life looking for spiritual understanding and experience. And this is one of the best books I have found. I picked it up and was captured by it's wisdom, beauty and Love. For me it was like a letter from home... a very dear home where those who love me, watch and wait for my eventual return.This book touched my heart and brightened my life. I write this in hopes that it will do the same for you.I love you, and look forward to our reunion. --FCB"
1,Buyer beware,"Richard Lynch, the author, states in the Introduction that ""One of the most important parts of this book is the collection of Hidden Power tools provided on the CD. *** These Hidden Power tools will enable you to access additional tools for elements such as Curves or Color Balance, and they will condense some of the longer step-by-step procedures you learn in the book to clicks of the mouse. On May 31, John Wiley has acquired Sybex, the publisher of the book. Sybex apparently no longer supports The Hidden Powers CD on its website. I bought the book because of the CD. I will now buy Scott Kelby's recent book on Elements 3 and return this one. Amazon should warn its customers of this problem instead of letting them find out themselves and going to the trouble and cost of returning it."
2,Just got Started and found my first error!,"I was looking for good book to give me additional pointers with Photoshop Elements 3, when I came across This book: The Hidden Power of Photoshop Elements 3. I just got to the point where I was about to install Power Tools, when I find my first problem. I tried to install Power Tools which tells me to look on page ""23"" for the password. I looked on page 23 found no password. After many minutes of anger, I decide to start from the begining of the book to see I could find the password. I found it on page xxiii of the unmarked pages. I hope this is the only error???P.S. I hoping it's the only error and I get the help I want?AB"
4,Other Books,"After Dungeons and Dragons, Perrin and Chaosium had another take on the fantasy role playing game setting, with an explicitly deity based magic system, and a skills based system in general, both for combat, and for everyday tasks.This allowed characters to be whatever they wanted without classes, or other such distinctions."
2,"Stylin' Cap, But Runs Real Small","It's a classy styling cap, but the small runs really small. It couldn't even fit the head of my five year old son, whose tiny to begin with. When describing this specific product, Amazon.com should give exact measurements of the fitted head size for this specific cap, besides only Small, Medium, & Large."
2,ENG ---Summer Holiday hits,"I was expecting the CD of the English movie of Cliff Richards and the Shadows from about 1963....""SUMMER HOLIDAY"" NOT a CD set from about 2006.Yes I am dissapointed.What can I do to rectify this situation????What is my recourse?? I have not even opened the wrapping. I am so dissapointed."
3,Its okay,I certain recommend looking at the quantity of similar items before you buy this one. The amount cannot cover two jobs.
1,Performs exactaly the same as radio shack Thermal compound,"And it costs 3 times more. Lesson learned. Dont be fooled by silver, its just silver dye."
1,A waste of time,I bought this product thinking it would lower the temperature of my cpu it didn't lower it 1 degree than the stock grease that came with my processor its a complete waste of money and time i would not recommend this product to anymore.
2,"Spend more, get Arctic Silver...","This stuff is only 25% silver, and while it does an ok job, I'm getting nearly 8 degrees centigrade lower readings with Arctic Silver 5. On something as sensitive as your computer, it's more than worth the extra few dollars (and lack of Amazon Prime) for AS 5."
5,Grease that works. Good quantity,"My Toshiba Satellite lap-top was restarting without warning. Figured out it was because of over-heating. I hated the constant re-starting but i think it actually saved my chip from frying due to heating. Great technology! Thanks Intel and M$ for standardizing this!Anyways the thermal grease comes in a no-nonsense easy to apply syringe. There was enough quantity in the tube to more than sufficiently cover the chip. In fact, i used less than a quarter and had to remove some to ensure it didn't spread over to the pins. I don't think instructions are needed for this! spread like butter and ensure an even coat with no air pockets... used a butter knife for the complex operation ;)Happy to report that laptop is working great after using this!"
4,Good cd but has distortion.,I like the cd and would recommend it to those who enjoy the music from the 80's period. My copy has distortion at the end and the beginning of the first two tracks. Are all the copies the same?
2,Pointless,"As someone who has read several books on Watergate, I have to ask: why was this published? It contains no new research, no new interviews, no revelations. The entire book is cobbled together from other books, which means that far too many important points and details are glossed over or ignored. What's worse is Olson's prose, so flat and lackluster that it reads like a description of a Senate Appropriations Bill, rather than as the story of the greatest constitutional crisis of the 20th century. Don't be fooled by the inexplicable raves on the cover-this is barely adequate at best. For a thorough and compelling read on Nixon's downfall, read Fred Emery's Watergate instead."
1,"Good idea, poorly made","While preparing for a week long ski trip to Utah spent decided I really wanted a way to dry out my boots overnight, however I needed something that would fit in my boot bag. This compact boot dryer looked the most promising: it wouldn't take up any additional room since it would fit in my boots and should have been able to dry both my boots and my gloves. Unfortunately when I received it I was immediately disappointed by the quality; they were obviously very cheaply made. I wasn't surprised but very disappointed that after receiving them in working condition on a Friday one of the fans completely failed two days later when I tried to use them to dry my ski boots. Thanks to Amazon for making returns so painless!"
3,A decent overview,"No-one will learn to be an evolutionary biologist from this book, however that is not its purpose. Like all the books in this ""Introducing..."" series from Icon books, it is written short paragraphs of digestable text and a images and diagrams on every page to illustrate. For an academic this would be a very annoying and frustrating read with silly pictures and surface level explanations, however for the uninitiated this is perfect starting place to get the general idea about the field.Note: the version reviewed was published in 1999 and much has happened in this controversial field since then."
5,"Finally, Independent environmental reports","E is a publication I recognize for its solid reporting on key issues. But most importantly, it is the independence of the solid, in-depth special reports that is most valuable to me and my fellow environmentalists.Not found in E are the typical political grunts and trite statements. I do not feel I am reading a political manefesto, or degrading my life by reading E. Just as important, when passing it on to others, I do not feel that I am an extension of some action group, but know that what I pass on is solid, quality reporting that take into account all sides of an issue. In addition to the solid reporting on an issue, E has expanded so every issue contains information on personal health, Green travel with a nice section on Green Investing that I found is truly effective for me.Overall I give E four stars for content and ADD a star for remianing indpendent of ""in-your-face"" commentary. A true Time magazine quality for the environmentally concerned."
5,Great Environmental Magazine,I recently subscribed to E! and the two magazines I have read have had some great articles.
1,Incompetent Vender,"Unfortunately the vender,Best Stop Electronics, didn't send me the promised Hitech charger. They sent me something called ""Charger"" which didn't charge batteries of the right type or even of that form factor. The charger wasn't even close. I wanted a charger that would support the Casio Exilim High Speed Camera (NP40 batteries). I complained and after a slow response they tried again. Again they didn't send a Hitech charger, but a substitute. This charger also wasn't capable of charging my batteries. Wasn't a functional replacement for the Hitech charger. I give up at this point.My experience indicated that Best Stop Electronics was an amateurish company; Amazon should screen their partners better."
1,A disappointment,"I had high expectations of this book. But the material presented in it could not even come close to meeting them. This book does not add anything to what you already know.Determine what you want and take the necessary steps to achieve that goal. Have strong believes and principles but stay flexible and be able to adapt when required. Be open to others, listen to what they have to say. Share your point of view, but don't force it on people. Study ""succesful"" people and learn what makes them succesful. Then integrate that information into your own life.It's amazing the author needs 300+ pages to deliver this message.There are many great books available on how to reach your full potential as a person, but this is not one of them.Save your money."
3,A bit of a mix up,"I liked the storylines, but felt the parallel stories would have been better if written individually.However, quite an enjoyable read."
2,What a disappointment!,"I read the three previous novels of this author and loved them. Impossible to believe the same author wrote this one.I suspect Robert Ludlum ghosted it. Convoluted. A significant portion of the story takes place in the protagonist's mind.Little action. Little suspense. Morality big here - like Grisham, the author decided it was time for to write about the homeless. You can pass this one!"
3,An easy summer read.,This book was definately a page-turner but not quite up to par with what I've come to expect from Mary Willis Walker. There seemed to be less character development than in her previous books and I kept getting frustrated with the usually level-headed Molly Cates. I felt like the author tried to do too much in one book so things like fleshed-out characters and plotlines tended to suffer. I think the parallel stories in this novel were worthy of standing alone and would've fared much better if they had.
4,From homelessness to nerve gas--a thrilling read!,"Molly Cates is an investigative journalist with an obsession to find out the truth about her father's death. The M.E. ruled the death a suicide, which Molly still refuses to accept after twenty eight years. In a plot which intertwines the hopelessness of the homeless as well as gun control lobbying and a Waco-type anti-government group, Molly tries to find out how her dad died and why a homeless woman is desperate to contact her. The characters are well defined--from Cow Woman to police detective Grady Traynor, Molly's ex-husband. The action is fast-paced and intensely dramatic, with the reader urging Molly to hurry with her investigation before the Texas Senate chamber erupts into a gas chamber of death!"
2,A GOOD CUP IS HARD TO FIND,THE CUP WAS THE RIGHT COLOR. THE METAL DECORATIVE RING ON THE BASE MADE IT UNSUITABLE FOR STANDARD BATHROOM CUP HOLDERS. IT'S TO LARGE AND DOESNT FIT IN ROUND CUP AREA. I WOUND UP GETTING A PLASTIC DRINKING CUP IN WALMART FOY 25CENTS. IT'S RED AND PLASTIC. A WASTE OF MONEY FOR DECORATIVE BATHROOM ACCENTS. SHOP LOCALLY
5,Good bass strings,"This is my favorite strings for bass guitar - Medium Scale, Nickel Wound. They soft, the ton is bright and clean.I can recommend it to anyone, who likes to play bass."
5,A must have!,"This book is a ""must have"" for anyone who wants to know what is going into their body. If you want to make an informed decision about what medicines you will or won't take, it is definitely worth the price as an addition to your home resource library."
1,Mac Users Beware,"If you're planning on using this switch with a Mac keyboard: Beware. Although is says ""For PCs and Macs"" on the box, this switch will NOT work out-of-the-box with a keyboard that has extra USB ports (which all modern Mac keyboards have). It needs the AC adapter, which is not included.Forget about finding a generic adapter at Radio Shack. The SV431USB requires an output of 5V DC at 2 Amps, which is next to impossible to find (except on the StarView website of course).This switch looked impressive, but I'm going to have to give it 1 star since I wasn't even able to get the keyboard going. If you have a regular keyboard and don't plan on connecting a USB hub or laptop to it, it might be worth a try."
3,Good for switching touch-screen Monitor,"Switches keyboard, video and mouse plus 2 other USB devices. Generally don't have a problem switching between desktop computers, but it does have problems with laptops - more than half the time only the video will switch over. I think this relates to the drivers within the laptop, but regardless of cause I would not recommend this switch for use with laptops. That being said, I am using this to switch a touch-screen monitor between computers, which requires both a video path and a USB path from the monitor. This is working great on my desktop computers running windows 7 and windows 8."
5,Work great with even fine monitor resolutions,I have ordered several of these KVM switches to use in my office. I've used them for a few years and they still work great. They with the monitors with 1920x1200 resolution. The only thing I had to do was converting VGA cable to the DisplayPort since the new computers now come DisplayPort or HDMI.
1,this kvm sucks,don't buy if u are looking for a kvm with hotkeys. this has none. you have to press the button on the box to switch computers.
2,"good, but not great","I used this to clean up scratches on my iPod nano. The scratches were caused by my nano and keys being in the same pocket for an afternoon.The product did indeed remove nearly all of the lighter scratches, but the deeper scratches remain. It also seems as though the finish on the nano is a little more dull than it was prior to using this product.All in all, the nano looks better, but not perfect."
5,Fado Incredible,"Misia is a new name for us. This was a featured album at a local music store which allowed us the listening pleasure of Misia and her entire album before purchasing. The fado's are incredible; like nothing we've ever heard before.Misia's haunting, soul-piercing yet angelic voice is only comparable (in our humble opinion) to Enya and Sarah Brightman.The Porteguese guitar is a perfect accompaniment with sheer perfection presented in the combination of fado's and diagonal lines drawn by the artists.We couldn't understand a word she sings and didn't know what language she was singing but we love every song on the album. We jumped at the chance to add it to our 5-star collection of CD's."
5,Being tortured by McAfee or Norton?,Then switch to PC-cillen! It works like a dream! I'm running it on my new Dell Desktop and have had absolutely no problems whatsoever since installing it several weeks ago. McAfee demolished my desktop so I promptly removed their software from my new Dell desktop when it arrived. Thank you Sony for including PC-cillen on my Vaio notebook -- otherwise I never would've known about it! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!
1,Side Effects with PC-cillin,"I installed this pc-cillin 2002 into my WIN98 machine. Machine started behaving erratic, then locked-up. I un-installed it and things went back to normal. E-mailed tech support, days later got return e-mail asking questions that I previously stated/answered.Waited a few days; sent another e-mail. Then another three days later, and another e-mail asking me to repeat everything I stated the first time! Nothing heard since. I tried to re-install, turning off some of the features; computer runs real slow with Netscape, after some time, locked up again. I certainly cannot recommend this product. Customer Support stinks, and the software is useless to me. I wished I had purchased Norton!"
3,(from book jacket),"Derrick and Emil both want the only summer job available to high school boys in Alaska being offered by Jack Clements, the owner of the Crab Boat VIKING. Instead of just a summer job, they must both grow up quickly and help their town recover from the devastation of an unexpected earthquake and resulting tidal wave."
2,a wonderfully written bore,"I have no problem in admitting that I heartily envy Ms Kushner's writing skills: she is a wondrous writer, she handles her language with a subtlety unheard of and still she manages to avoid any overwriting or mannerism.The story itself, though, is far from great. Some reviewers say it is true to the legend: should it be really so, part of the problem might lie in the original plot and yet the author could have done something to amend that.Be it as it may, her characters are awfully dull -except for the elderly couple- and Elfland is lushiously boring, its queen being the worst of all.The verses included are enjoyable."
2,A very dumb story.,"Don't waste your time reading this, the story is about a framed up bank robbery staged by several merchants and the bank cashier and with the sheriff involved also, the lead character of the story has it figured out in the first few pages and after that it is just going around in circles with the bad guys. I would have to call this another bad joke of a story, it just doesn't make any sense in the way it is told, from obivously knowing who the man behind things is to protecting the crooked sheriff and his daughter who is in love with a worthless type. Don't waste your time on this."
1,horrid!! terrible!!!,this movie was the MOST OFFENSIVE piece of material i have ever seen. my husband and I were discusted! If you are thinking about getting this movie...DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY! this has no educational value. at least not to do with birth. its more of have orgasm. if i could give this a TRUE rating it would be -9999999999999999999!!
1,IT'S A FAKE!!!,"It's supposed to be a documentry, on natural childbirth. Instead they show some freakin' stupid 10 minute chicken dance workout. I'm so pissed and so glad I hit the rent button, instead of the buy button. I KNOW IT'S ONLY $2, BUT I HATE BEING RIPPED OFF!!!"
3,Good video- but very repetitive,"If you've watched Ricki Lake's documentary The Business of Being Born then you've seen a lot of this type of footage and a lot of the same interviews and stats before. I found this documentary to be very repetitive on the whole, though it was empowering to see women birthing outdoors in the open and having a good time with it.Having had my own birth experience I can tell you that while it was extremely positive, drug-free and intervention free, it was by NO MEANS orgasmic. Not even close. Exhausting yes, orgasmic, no. But go ahead and watch this documentary anyway if you're feeling fear about giving birth thinking you can't do it, or it will hurt too much. Fear and pain is in the mind. That's the best take away from this documentary as far as I'm concerned."
3,"Great in places, fair in others",Everyone we have spoken to said that the last woman profiled was playing up to the camera. It would be great for women if what she seemingly experienced during birth...but the unbelievability of the last woman made the overall video just three stars.
4,Not what I expected,"My husband and I ordered this movie hoping to watch all natural births, but we're taken aback when they sbegan showing hospital births as well. Definitely an informative documentary regardless, but I wouldn't call it a ""must see""."
5,A very good documentary! Highly recommended.,"I wanted to have a natural, unmedicated child birth and was looking for resources that would give me encouragement and tips on achieving my goal. Orgasmic Birth did just that! Definitely a must see."
3,not impressed,"I had high hopes for this DVD, but I was a bit disappointed. Maybe because I already knew much of the information presented. I watched this with my husband and was a bit uncomfortable with the couples shown, it was a strange concept. Also mothers I have spoken with have said they felt NOTHING like an orgasm when they gave birth. I liked ""The Business of being born"" much better. I feel like I paid too much for this. Orgasmic birth was a bit too far out there for my taste."
5,Beautiful documentary on birth,"I wish that every woman could experience birth in the beautiful way shown in this film. Pregnant women and their partners should view this together to counter the many scary births usually shown on TV and in film. It will help them to gain confidence in the process of birth and in their own ability to have a beautiful birth experience. The physicians, midwives, doulas, and birthing women in this film are true advocates of normal, natural birth who have wonderful stories to share."
3,From The Inside Flap:,"This book is an imaginative skillful translation into the words and photographs of the magnificent region familiary known as the Rockies. These mountains are famous for their unspoiled, wild beauty. Many reaks are still unclimbed an, in the north, some areas remained little explored. Rugged, austere, terrible beauty is everywhere present in the high Rockies. By the use of poetic metaphors and highly artistic photographs, the Rocky Mountian Symphony takes the viewer into both the most intimate and superbly dramatic moods of these mountains. This new approach to the heights is a uniquely different way of sharing with the public long lasting, treasurable impressions of one of the most beautiful regions in Canada."
2,Disappointed in product!,"Our first unit arrived and with in the first day of use was giving errors on known good wiring. We discovered two of the four nodes were the problem. We contacted the manufacturer and they wanted us to return to our place of purchase. Amazon was great about promptly returning. At the same time we ordered an identical one and when it arrived, we promptly tested with known good cables. Again, we found we had defective node end points. We called the manufacturer again and they never called us back as promised.In the end, we return the second unit to Amazon and are now looking for another make/model to purchase. If you purchase this, do so with caution testing all components immediately and for the next several days. :-("
2,"Good quality, but get the data+power cable...","The quality of this cable is fine, but it doesn't give you access to the power pins that are in the Garmin interface. Get the cable that does power and data instead... or if you're a hardware geek, then make your own with the stuff from purple open projects (pfranc.com)"
3,Excelent for Portables.,"The cable doesn't come with any software, but is great for upgrading the software on your eTrek(avilable from Garmin's website) You will need a GPS compatible mapping program to get the full advantage. The cable connects very securly to the GPS, and is plenty long enough."
2,Try to find a port,"I own a Sony VAIO computer. In the computer, there are no ports to put in this cord. Ended up buying something for [money] to convert it to a USB connection. Then, I couldn't find a program that would be able to send and receive data to my eTrex GPS via a USB port. Was definitely a hassle."
5,Garmin Etrex Serial Connection,Product slides into place quickly and works exactly as described. Cable is long enough to conveniently use the GPS real time with a mobile computer.
4,No Problems,"Works great--overpriced for what it is, but with that's to be expected for any proprietary connections like this.As others have said below, make sure you realize that this is an RS-232 serial port cable, which is not included on a lot of laptops these days."
5,Yawn..... Where am I?,Why am I here? I went for a peice of cheeze and now I'm noline writing a..... review? O...k. Shimmer? Uh.. yeah. Great song love it. I'm going to bed now. Bye
1,False advertising,"The totally uncensored description of the title and by Amazon.com is false advertising. Every part of this show has been edited, blacked out, and beeped out. Amazon.com should not sell this one or the campanion dvd Road rage."
2,Ye gods.,"This is so utterly moronic... Only people who were already drinking the Dora kool-aid (or had seen this story on TV) could think that this string of words could actually pass for a ""story."" God, ""Dora"" is a dumb show. At least with the books you don't have to hear the obnoxious, whiny voiceovers. I feel sorry for kids who get parked in front of the 'tube when ""Dora"" is on... What a terrible way to spend your childhood."
2,Major Disappointment,"For me, this book is a major disappointment. The biggest gaping hole in the book is the fact that the author was not able to interview either Gamble or Huff. It also reads like a college textbook - dull writing style. This was hot R&B music of the 1970's and the writing should have reflected the excitement in the music."
5,Another good Warhammer novel,"While I enjoy the space marine novels better, the Gaunt's ghosts series has not disappointed me yet. Necropolis had alot going for it; large scale warfare, squad combat, personalizing the characters to the point you either like or dislike them, and it follows a good storyline."
5,Great knife,I use a chef's knife for most anything a paring knife won't do. But this knife is heavy without being as big as chef's knife..and the blade extension under the hand really makes chopping tough items easy.
3,"Great knife, no COVER???","I own most everything in the Rachael Ray line of cookware, bakeware, and cutlery. I bought this knife last week and while its a great knife...there's NO cover for it??? I called Furi 877-567-9440 and they say, ""Yeah right now, unfortunately the only way to purchase this knife is by itself or with the cover."" When I bought the knife I didn't realize there was an alternative. To the person above who ""corrected"" the error...how did you do that?If you're going to buy this knife (and you should), make sure you have a plan for storing it. I already own a Rachael Ray 10-piece knife set which came with a knife block. Since I prefer not tossing my expensive knives in a drawer...I guess I'm either going to have to purchase a knife block for ONE knife or wait until Furi figures out they need to sell the covers separately too. Or at least Amazon updates the item description making it clear that this sells with NO cover."
5,A Must Have.,Bottom line here is that every kitchen should have one or two of these. You won't want to chop vegetables with anything else once you own it.
5,great knife,I purchased new knives for myself recently and this one is my favorite so far. The handle has a nice grip and the rocking motion makes it easy to chop. It arrived quickly with no issues.
4,forged chef's rocker knife,"I love the chef's rocker knife but it really should come with a protective cover or sheath as it was very sharp. I use it only on a cutting board, but it is not AS sharp any longer and I'd have thought for the cost of the knife that it would stay sharper longer. I DO love the knife as it makes chopping and dicing way easy. If Rachael Ray came out with a smaller version of this knife I would buy it."
2,not worth the money,"This video series was not what I thought it would be. I was lookin for a technique video, very visually orientated. This was a series of campy skits on buying a vibrator and where the clitoris is. The only reason it gets two stars is because it is so stupid it is funny. If you want to watch English people talking about sex and not doing it then this series is for you."
4,These are fun.,"These were a fun first Christmas for my little boy. I was a little disappointed in the size, they are fairly small."
3,"Really cute, but small for the price","I thought looked really cute for my new nephew -- my brother's first born. It was so perfectly little boy. I was slightly disappointed, however, to find it SO small for the price. It's as small as a little clutch purse. It was, nevertheless, well received and very ideal for a 3 month old, as the tools were perfect for his little fists! I have 5 kids of my own, so I have seen a lot of toys!!!!"
4,The Luftwaffe dreams of bombing America,"Well-written and illustrated, Duffy's book is a readable introduction to the varied plans of both Germany and Italy to attack the United States from a distance during the Second World War. The book is wide-ranging, though lacking in some detail at points. However, there are endnotes and a bibliography (which also lists some websites), so the advanced reader can investigate further.This was a fairly easy read, with decent illustrations to help the reader picture in his/her mind the various plans and vehicles that the Axis had in its plans.A good introduction to this topic."
3,Setting the USA in his sights,"This book serves to bring ALL the projects Germany was working on in order to attack the United States and possibly knock it out of the war. This includes long-range bombers (which Germany easily had the technical know-how to build), advanced rockets, saboteurs, submarine attacks, etc. The book does not go deep into all the projects and the illustrations give the impression that the book is almost entirely about the bomber option. The book refers to a map that was recently discovered which illustrated possible air routes for bombing attacks outside Europe but this is not included. Nonetheless, a good effort on a subject which is rarely looked at today."
5,"While it can't completely resolve the mystery, it does lend many insights.","While it can't completely resolve the mystery, it does lend many insights. James P. Duffy's TARGET AMERICA: HITLER'S PLAN TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES argues that Hitler intended to bring war to America once he'd succeeded fully in Europe: for the first time Hitler's plans for worldwide offensives using his new secret weapons are revealed, with chapters recounting other Axis schemes for attack and how planners considered various options for conquest.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,Target US,This is an interesting book that deals with the different technologies that both the Germans and Italians were attempting to use in their quest to bring the war to the USA mainland.I learned what the Italians had to offer was more surprising than you might think.
3,The Long campaign - a reprint,"A group history in the usual format, chapters on operations in chronological order, and the necessary appendices on casualties, aircraft lost, commanders etc. Decent photos.What annoys me is that this book has exactly the same contents as the original published some 25 years ago by Sunflower Press, and author nor publisher mention this fact. The foreword by Lambert suggests he has just finished the job."
2,Dissappointing,"After hearing so many positive things about Tim Easton, I picked up this CD and gave it a listen. I find it completely underwhelming. I have listened to it many times to see if I am missing something; I am a HUGE Wilco fan and with most of the band playing behind Tim, I thought it would get better with every listen.My number one reason for not liking this Album is Tim's voice. It's flat, with no great tonality. It reminds more of heavy breathing. For great music of this genre, search out Matt Nathanson.... Matt's got a better voice and more creativity.Just my opinion..."
2,What happened?,"A major dissapointment after Special 20. Special 20 is on my top 10 all time best CD List. I'm afraid you've lost a lot more than your twang on this one, Tim. I'll be following your career, for the potential is there..."
4,Tim Easton Review,"I enjoy this album very much. It definitely helps me mellow out on my drives home. If you enjoy Tim Easton or folk music in general, I think that you will like this album."
3,good but...,ok here is the deal the guy below said that the last 1/2 of the cd was what was worth checking out but in reality the cd(power weapons) is all old songs (except 2)and the first half of the cd is rerecorded and not very well my cd has parts that just are nothing no music no vocals no nothing in my opinion you need to track down the old s/t cd released a like a yr or 2 ago on less avenged records its hard to find but its worth it they are also good liveif it was the old cd it would get 5 stars
4,game review,"This game wa very enjoyable and fun. My child loves the show and the books and the game takes all of that and incorprates it into a whole package. The cards and pranks are fun, and the playpieces are very detailed. This is a great game for anyone who is familiar with the books and the show."
2,Poorly researched attempt at a biography of a great saxophonist,"Curtis Ousley was one of the great exponents of soul saxophone. Along with Junior Walker, he blazed a trail for all those who were to follow and their musicianship is still being copied today. Such greatness deserves a great biography and I'm afraid this is not it. The enthusiuasm of the author comes across but the book is short on content and research. The faded photographs of King Curtis's old LP covers is testament to the short cuts that have been made. If you are interested in the basic background to the King Curtis story then I suppose this may be a starting point but you may be well advised to wait until a better researched biography is brought out."
2,Very Complicated,"The instructions were no help to us, and when we figured them out the top still did not work. Waste of time and effort."
2,Had to sell it,"Even if it is a great idea, it is really hard to use it and to keep it balanced in the air.Too complicated"
4,boat,This boat was a God-send. It was shipped to Mongolia for use by missionaries to transport people back and forth across the river to church.It has been good quality and much appreciated.
4,Durable boat,"Bought this in June of 2009. Although I have not experienced any leaks, the boat seems very well constructed by the fact that it is made up of several compartments, so if one compartment springs a leak in the middle of your journey, there are enough other compartments to help keep you going until you can get ashore.After use, the deflated boat is a bit tricky to carry and store away, but overall I am happy with this boat."
4,Missing items *- a lot!,"Dear! Where is DEINE LAKAIEN? Where is FIREWATER? Where is INTERPOL? Where is SLOWDIVE? Where is WOLFMOTHER and many other, in my opinion, shapers of popular music? Aguillera and Spears unfortunately are in place....Authors have to pay more attention what they put in such important book, and do not leave behaind the board really iportant bands!"
5,great dog shampoo.....,"Dr. Bronner's soaps have been in my house for about 20 years. I always get the big jugs of liquid, and dilute into smaller bottles. I use them as hand soaps, body soaps, and hair shampoo (dilute, dilute...). Favorites are lavender, pepppermint, and eucalyptus. I use the eucalyptus as dog shampoo.....started doing so after reading that eucalyptus is a natural flea repellent. THe soap, diluted about 4 parts water to 1 part soap, is a good gentle cleaner, and leaves their coats shiny and wonderfully scented."
4,Wakes You Up!,"I love all Dr. Bronner's products. I accidentally ordered this one instead of the Tea Tree Oil Liquid (they are both the same color) and I like the Eucalyptus much better! I have a hard time getting up early and for school I have to wake up when it was still dark and this liquid soap made my morning go by quicker and smoother. Even when I finished getting ready out of the bathroom, my roommate commented on how it kind of woke her up to when she entered the bathroom! I would give it five stars but I do not like the packaging. When I am partially asleep in the shower, my slippery hands tend to drop it often before it wakes me up! Other than the actual liquid itself, no complaints!"
3,Eucalyptus liquid soap is much too watery,"I purchased Dr. Bronner's eucalyptus liquid soap from Vitamin Shoppe via Amazon. I read a review that warned it was watery but I took my chances. Yes, indeed, it is very watery. I use much more of it than I want in order to wash with it simply because it is too watery. Sometimes I wonder if it is eucalyptus-scented water. I like it, I like how it leaves my skin feeling, but I am very disappointed at the cost-to-water ratio. If I could find a better alternative I would, but so far have had little luck finding eucalyptus soap anywhere else."
1,Disappointing,"I think I spent the entire time I read this book shaking my head. Even now, I still don't know why I finished it. The character development was poor, the story jumped around a lot, and I didn't feel like I finished this book knowing Jordan and Amanda any better than I did when I first started. The two didn't communicate. At all. I just didn't get them. The premise was much better than the story turned out to be.This was Disappointing. I'm still wondering why I finished it. Maybe I thought it might get better. It didn't. This definitely does not go on my keeper shelf."
2,Boring,"I don't at all understand all the 5-star reviews this book is getting. I had to force myself to keep reading; the main problem was extremely weak character development. At the end of the book, I still didn't feel I knew either Jordan or Amanda, except that they both craved sex, and more sex, and more sex. There were very few conversations of the type that lets you get to know a person - instead, they just had more sex, and even the sex scenes were just blatant, not sensual. Amanda was so weak-willed, I wanted to shake her. Jordan COULD have been interesting, if we'd ever gotten a chance to know him. A sad disappointment."
2,"Vic's priceless, but this is not.","I like Vic. I like lo-fi. I don't like ""Left to His Own Devices."" These aren't the mordant, stinging songs of ""Drunk"" and ""Is the Actor Happy?"", both amazing records. These songs wander and wobble; Vic's voice is weak, the guitar is murky, and the whole enterprise seems water-soaked. Some great musicians aren't great recording engineers or producers; it's worth your while to look for Vic Chesnutt's better records, though."
3,Good replacement,"This was just what I wanted, a cheap basic replacement for the one that was broken. Nothing fancy, just some place to hang the hand held shower."
4,exellent for ATM signaling,"easy to read and step-by-step explanation.. More useful and pletiful diagram than recommendation.. and comprehensive( ITU, ATM-Forum ) background... I can't escape from this book by the last page. You will need not thick and many recommendations related to signaling any more!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Dry? This production is a mouthful of alum. But an instructional video doesn't need to be entertaining, only informative, and this one fails badly. The instructor is a chiropractor who performs the session in a dress shirt (without rolling up his sleeves), and he is stilted, off-balance and awkward. His explanations of the strokes are cursory, poorly done also. As a professional therapist, I can tell you this guy is nobody to emulate. I give it one star for the nice photo on the jacket..."
3,Not Top quality but fun!,I am not impressed with the quality of the little bears. The plastic is cheap and some of the bears have imperfection from the mold. But my daughter loves playing with them and I'm happy she is having fun while learning!
1,Arrived damp and smelling of mildew,"I was extremely unhappy with this product. It has nothing to do with the toy itself, it was the packaging. The box had obviously been extremely wet at some point and had been let dry. The box still had a dampness to it and both it and the toy inside smelled like mildew. I have washed this in vinegar water but the odor still lingers. It was intended to be a gift but now will not be."
3,Cute counting set..,This is cute for sorting and counting but I think the package could have been better quality..it's thin and bent in.. seemed cheesy to give as part of a gift. However the bears are cute and colorful!!!
5,my little one like it,"you get 10 mini bears of each of the 5 colors. It allows you to spend some time with your little one, teach him/her about color, counting, sorting, cleaning up after they empty the content on the floor."
5,Great Receptive Language Tool,"Aside from all the wonderful, yet obvious uses for this toy (counting, sorting, color recognition, math) my 2.5 year old daughter's Early Intervention teachers use these to work on her language skills (both expressive and receptive). For example, they put bears all around the room and then say ""I see a bear ON TOP of the bookshelf!"" And my daughter has to listen and go find it. They work on words like ""under"" ""over"" ""beneath"" ""between"" ""near"" etc. She loves hunting all around the room and listening to the clues. When sorting, they work on numeracy words like ""few"" ""many"" ""most"" ""all"" ""some"" and ""none."" For example, they will ask her to put a ""few"" in the cup, or to find ""all"" the bears and put them in the cup, etc. I love toys that can be used in many, many ways and this one fits the bill! So many great uses!"
5,Great Toy!,"This toy had great reviews but it just didn't look like much fun. I bought it hesitantly for my grandson who is two years old. It was very reasonable so not much money lost I thought. Well, to my surprise - He absolutely loves it. He is learning to count and learning his colors. He just loves putting them in and out of the cups that are included. These bears are about an inch or so high and extremely durable. You may lose them but you could never destroy them. I would not purchase them for a child under two because of the small size of the bears or if your child likes to put things in his/her mouth. I highly recommend this product."
3,Choke hazzard,Great toy for sorting but not a good toy for younger kids. The bears are very small and are definitely a choking hazzard
3,fun learning toy,I store these bears out of reach and in a container... or else the little bears disappear in a heartbeat and hide very well. A good toy to play with as a parent child activity.
3,Functional,"Rating would be higher, but the yellow bears all had a black circle on their belly from the manufacturing process which makes them look dirty and old. It would be better if there were a few different sizes of bears as well."
1,poor quality - very cheap,"spend the extra money and buy the learning resources sorting bears. They are better quality.If you child has any sensory issues, these are not the bears for you. They are very rough on the sides.The learning resouces are more like rubber and very smooth. These were a cheap china plastic.Not worth your money."
5,Wonderful,This is a great idea and a great learning tool. I wish they came with a little baggy or something but this was a fun toy to get around Christmastime...kept him interested.
3,Alphabetically sorted,"The words have indeed been carefully selected. However, I believe there are more efficient ways to improve your vocabulary. Instead of organizing words by themes, they are listed alphabetically. This means that you have to select and rewrite them somewhere else. If you are as busy as I, select a book with themed ""word-clusters""."
4,GREAT AND CONVENIENT BUT DULL AND UNENCOURAGING,"Great way to improve your vocabulary if you can't stand reading, but very uninteresting. It would be much better for you to read a book or magazine. If you really want to improve your vocabulary, for example, for the SAT, this book will work, but again, it would be better for you to read and look up words you don't know."
1,Ridiculous -- little more than an...,"...abridged dictionary with a couple of example sentences for each word...infinitely better books are available -- search for George Feinstein, D.J. Henry, Margaret Richek."
5,Educated -- to say the least . . .,"In a word: Excellent. This book clarifies the meaning of words. So not only will you learn them, become aquainted with them, or use them -- you will properly use them. Wielding words in the proper context. It's a must have for people serious about using an ""educated vocabulary"". . . ."
5,"5 Stars,,,BUT","I own all 4 seasons of ""Doctor Finlay"" and enjoy them more than I can say. My one gripe with season 4 is the lousy ending. I really think it kinda stinks,,,,,,that said, I LOVE the Doctor Finlay music theme andIf you love the Scots then you will love this wonderful and thoughtful series."
5,Excellent Treatment of a Controversial Topic,"This book is well-written, and an easy read of a difficult topic. It is unpopular to suggest that children may be harmed by over-protecting them, but the author presents a well-reasoned and well-documented argument of just that position. This should not be taken as a definitive treatment of the subject, but as an essential element of a balanced and complete look at the issues of children and sex."
5,A wonderful and important book,"Judith Levine asks the important questions that have lurked in my mind for a long time. Where is the proof of this that ""everybody knows"" that sex or porn is harmful to minors? There is none, but there is plenty proof that making a great mystery out of it is very harmful indeed.There is no doubt that writing and publishing a book like this puts one's career in jeopardy in the current political climate. My hat is off to the author and the publisher!"
3,Interesting and thought provoking,"Harmful to minors is a book that should be read by people who agree and disagree. In a nation where sexual assault has reached epidemic proportions, It is time that the issues of sex are discussed freeley and not kept in the closet.As an award winning director/writer of Rape Awareness Public Service Announcements (nation federation of cable tv programmers 1991-National Broadcasting Society 1990) I have witnessed the uncomfortable feelings when sex is discussed even in an academic forum, or disusses in the media.The only real way is to open intelligent dialogue,and i believe that Judith Levine attempts to do just that in this book. Rating the book on writing ability and style, the book deserves 5 stars.I gave it three stars because of her somewhat bias liberal slant on the issues discussed. But I urge people to read this book and discuss it."
2,"You must read it, but...","Since I continuously found references to this book on writings in many articles I read on the matters of child abuse, sex orientation, child care, family, etc., I thought I had to read it myself. Well, as an exercise of intellectual discipline –meaning that you must expose yourself directly to the issues “opinion makers”, good or bad- you the must read it, if those subjects are of your professional or personal interest. But, beware, the book is not a good one and author doesn’t really know much what she is talking about. Maybe all the mayhem around this book is because, by the time it was published, some of its statements seemed bold and even daring politically incorrect. But now that social values have been turned upside down, it is boringly PC. And, of course, the lack of any useful or never mind enlightening knowledge remains."
3,"Important questions, leftist bias","In this day and age of polarized politics, sex has become a strange yet hot topic. The questions presented in this book are excellent, and indeed need to be asked. But it is indeed true that blaming the neurotic sexual mores of Americans on right-wing republicans really does more harm that good.This book is a good first step in making sexuality a normal, healthy part of Americans lives."
1,A thinly veiled attempt to get child sex normalized,"This book is just a thinly veiled attempt to make pedophilia ""normal"" and allow adults to prey on children for sex. Consider the quote in the review by the ""doctor"" stating ""pedophiles can't change"" - so does that mean we let them have their way with our children? Even most homosexuals object to pedophilia and say it is an avoidable condition with treatment!It's argued that children used to be married all the time by age 12. But today, especially in America's easy living society, our children's minds are not as developed as those of Biblical days, the Renaissance or the American frontier. They're babies. Please leave them alone."
1,Harmful to all people,"Thanks to this book, more teenagers and children are going to have so-called ""protected"" sex and end up with STDs. I remember my public school sex education well, and nowhere in it was I informed that condoms are not made of steel and that they don't protext from certain diseases (such as genital warts) AT ALL. This book is another effort to sexualize children at younger and younger ages. The people who make fun of abstinence make ME laugh. I didn't have to have an AIDs test before my wedding."
1,MISLEADING: Arguments are very weak,"I am required to read this book as part of an undergraduate class. I find that there are many weak arguments in her book. The weakest of all and the most obvious is the weak supportive argument.Many times I flipped to the bibliography and found out that the source for the argument is weak. For example, she used an article from 'Playboy' magazine to support her argument.This is an issue if one understand how to research paper and presented a well-rounded arguments. It would be good if she usejournal paper / books to support her arguments.Another issue even when she use journal paper, she mis-interpret the conclusion. For example, strong positive correlation only shows that both variables are related. However, Levine interprets data as if one variable causes the other."
3,Interesting hybrid...,"It's not quite a book of erotica, and it's not quite a deep historical novel. The characters are prettty well fleshed out. Alexander is a god to his men. It's a quick read. (...)All-in-all, pretty good but not great."
2,Disappointing,"After reading the reviews on this novel, I was very excited to read In the Shadow of Alexander. However, after reading the book, I was quite disappointed. I thought I had purchased a historical novel. Instead, it seemed that I purchased a romance novel about homosexual love. I would have preferred more history with detailed battle scenes. The various love scenes were a bit too much."
3,"Just OK, not great","If you don't mind riding your bike in city traffic at 30Mph then OK. These were obviously recorded in a car going at least 30 MPH or faster on city streets, alleys, parking lots etc. Even got trapped in parking lot in Washington(C'mon.) They'll keep you busy and occupied while peddling but with a little effort and some technical savvy they could have been MUCH better."
4,Bike-O-Vision Cycling #9,The scenery was great and I really enjoy especially cycling on the city streets. However I am not a fan of the music and usually just turn it down and use my MP3 player.
2,Barely used,Wasn't used very much but was better than I anticipated for the sections I did read. Acutally used in class.
4,Batman toys,My son absolutely loves this toy he plays with it all the time my son is very satisfied Thank you
1,Make sure this product is appropriate for your GPS,"I purchased this product to plot and provide turn-by-turn directions for trips and to load maps to my Legend. This product does not provide turn-by-turn directions. When I called the Garmin software help line, the suggestion was made to purchase the Metroguide USA product since it had all functions of R&R and more. Seems the R&R was the first software product offered and is for low memory units (1mb). This is an obsolete product and since I opened the package--it cannot be returned. If you have a newer GPS unit with more than a mb of memory, don't bother with this software. It is not designed for your unit. Don't look for this info in the manual--it's not there. Call the help line and you may find your money was wasted."
3,Adequate but old - missing even some major roads,"Roads and Recreation works well with a mapping Garmin GPS, but has not been updated in a long time. The current and original version 3.00 is missing some major highways built since 1999 and some since 1998. If you don't mind occasionally driving across empty countryside (on your mapping GPS), then this product is pretty good. For roads before 1999, major and minor, it works well as a download into a mapping Garmin GPS. For PC-only use it does not compare with other products such as those from Delorme (Street Atlas)or Microsoft. Garmin should be honest about its MapSource products and tell the user when they were last updated. This is especially true for its basic marine software, Waterways and Lights. Software sells fancy GPS units. In the case of Garmin, adequate best describes the software. It's right up there with a 3-year old telephone directory. Most everyone is listed, except..."
1,LOOK OUT,"I have a Legend and wanted additional map details for my unit - so I purchased this software. Well, I got all the map details but no functionality. The documentation is bad and so is the online help. Worst of all you can not even look up a street address - even with a paper map I can look up the general area of a street. What's up with that? I would not recommend this product at all buy the Metroguide."
2,Truly disappointed,"These bowls have Harley Davidson decals on them. I could have bought my own silver bowls and just put a HD decal on them. Why did I not think of doing that? Also, the price sticker on the bottom of the bowls were VERY difficult to remove. They must have been sitting in the warehouse for years..I will not order from this company again for fear that everything is probably expired or about to be expired.."
4,"i have 2 of these for my kitten, they go well in a man cave","being a hetero male i was over joyed to find a pair of these for my kitten, shes just a tiney scamp, as the other reviewer mentions theyre far too small for a big dog, but they hold more then enough for a lone cat for days on end."
1,Too small,"I love the look of these bowls, but they're too small. They're the largest bowls I can find that say ""Harley Davidson"" on them but they don't hold enough food or water for a 50 lb. (average) dog."
1,Stinky,"This smells nothing like lilac...it has a very strong chemical odor, it actually smells like cheap old lady perfume. I was looking for the soft floral sent of lilacs but this is not it. However I have no complaints of the seller, the product reached me within a week of ordering, it was well packaged and even had tape around the lid to prevent any leaking."
1,rip off foot warmers,These foot warmers are a joke! They are overpriced for what they are...If they worked it would be ok but they dont work.They also came off & got all crimpped up in less than 2 weeks.These things are junk!!!
1,Has problems,"I have owned two of these pumps and both have failed with the same problem. After two years the impeller shaft broke and since it is the only moving part it's easily replaceable. However, in both cases, the old impeller damaged the internal bearing and housing so the replacement impeller is useless. My emails to Danner Mfg go unanswered...The pump is used in a pond only 6 months out of the year, then it is removed, cleaned, and stored in my basement until the following summer. I won't buy another."
4,"An Interesting, though not best VPO New Year's Concert","From a musicological perspective this year's Vienna Philharmonic New Year's Concert led by Riccardo Muti is among the most interesting ever offered, since its program includes premieres of lesser known works by Johann Strauss Senior, his sons, and others who contributed to the development of the Viennese waltz. Not surprisingly much of the program is devoted to Strauss senior since it is the bicentennial of his birth. However, the orchestra doesn't nearly play with as much brio as I have heard in previous years, most notably Muti's 2000 concert and Harnoncourt's 2001 concert. The orchestra truly rises to the occasion for performances of traditional encores Blue Danube waltz and Radetzky March, composed respectively by Johann Strauss Junior and Senior. Still the fine sound quality as well as the very good, if not outstanding, performances should appeal not only to Strauss fans but also to long-time admirers of the Vienna Philharmonic."
5,O2 Sensor-Toyota 4 Runner,The product was as described. There were printed instructions which left much to be desired. The internet has better instructions. Product easy to change and works!
5,Excellent OEM replacement 2001 4runner,"Make sure this is for your vehicle and this is the problem before opening package (no returns once opened!)The one on the car had ""Toyota"" and ""Denso"" written on it. This one just says ""Denso.""Two nuts hold the sensor to the exhaust ahead of the CAT passenger side. One bolt holds connector to the transmission.10 minute job if you spray the studs on the exhaust with Deep Creep or PB Blaster the night before!Cleared the Check Engine light.Noticed a slight increase in fuel economy, quicker warm up, smoother idle and shifting."
5,"Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous....","I personally have ALL the 2 Live Crew recordings (when I say ALL, I mean every last one of 'em). I saw this concert on TV back in November 1990, and recently decided to buy the soundtrack to their concert. I know all their music and have follwed their history ever since they premiered in the late 1980's. I don't like Rock N'Roll these days at all, not one single band is good these days, yet rap gets better with each passing day. Everyone seriously needs to be like me and get AAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL of 2 Live Crew's albums."
3,"Uh, who's Leo?","No idea what the editorial review is talking about. This is NOT the ""third album by"" Sparks! It may be that Leo whoever may well have three albums, but this ain't one of them! This is from somewhere near #20 for Sparks and in the area of 2000 (give or take a year or two). I just wanted to clarify that so folks aren't confused. I don't wish 'Leo' any ill will, but this is Sparks! The editorial review is either dead wrong or terribly misleading! The editorial review of the other edition of this release IS correct.Product Description1999 single from the wacky new wave duo, the first from their 2000 album 'Balls'. Pt.2 contains five mixes of 'More Than A Sex Machine' (Sparks Album Version, Radio Version, Two Phunky People Full Vocal Disco Fever Mix, Two Phunky People More Than A Sex Dub and Whirlpool Sex Dub Mix). Slimline jewel case."
5,What One Hopes for In a Cookbook,"My American flatmate gave me this cookbook after I continually used her copy. I've never tried a bad recipe in this book and I've frequently been begged to pass several of the recipes on (particularly the Banana Choc Chip Bread, the Cafe Beaujolias Coffee Cake and the Chicken Quarters in Chermoula!). Highly recommended!"
3,Quirky but informative autobiography,"Obst is a real character and lived a very interesting life. One part of it was publishing the Pentagon Papers, which is a very informative part of the book."
4,"Wonderful recipes, made healthier in River Road III","I guess I would give this book more like 4 1/2 stars. My fiance is from New Orleans and I wanted to serve more native dishes but in a healthier way. This book is just the ticket. The only thing I'd change is a few more of the ""traditional"" recipes but what is in there is very good with easy-to-follow directions. I especially like the way it shows you the difference between the original and lighter recipes. My future mother in law has used the book for years and really likes it. I can't wait to try more recipes."
2,recipes ok,"they just did not jump out at me. After perusing the book I did not find a single thing that I would want to make. Either I am getting too old to cook any more,not hungry, or prefer full fat eating...I think it is the last reason!"
3,Half Really Cool...Half Really Odd,"A fun new Cd from John Cale an always unique artist you'll never see on MTV though some songs here definitely have hit potential especially the very catchy Perfect.Also pretty darn good are For a Ride,Hush,Woman and the rocking Turn the Lights On.Too bad some songs veer from the strange,Brotherman,to the annoying Mailman.Fortunately though there's enough good stuff here to make it worthwhile,Cale's enjoyable dip into the mainstream."
3,Acceptable.,"This is a perfectly competent story about what happens when one brother shrinks himself when their parents are away. Wacky Hijinks Ensue!Except I didn't find it very interesting myself. The storyline is fairly realistic (well, once you get over the magic), but it just didn't draw me in. And so it goes, we can't all be fans of every book."
2,Not amusing for the target audience,"The story background here should provide an imaginative tale...a medieval family, alchemy, and a shrinking brother. But the actual story line won't amuse children from the age of 4 - 8. The problem with the book is a somewhat mean-spirited story and it's rather dull unfolding. Some other reviewers on this page were amused and even flattered by Steig's 'respect' for his audience's intellectual curiosity insofar as he uses an advanced vocabulary in the story. Permit me to ask you. Would the early reader in your family go to the dictionary when he encounters 'big' words on each page? Would his attention hold, if 50% of the book had to be explained by an adult because it was obscure to him... and uninteresting besides?"
4,Do you need to pay more?,"I bought this to replace my older dropped-too-many-times jamb level. It's accurate, has a lifetime warranty and cost 1/3 what a Stabila would cost. Not only that, it has crisper edges which makes it easier to use to draw a line accurately and the bubble extends from line to line which is easier to read than many other levels I've seen.I'm not so sold on the blue vials making it easier to read...I think that's a marketing idea but it doesn't seem to be a problem at least.I didn't realize Empire wouldn't sell a 32"" level separately so now if I want a ""jamb set"" I'd have to go buy someone elses 32"" level. Seems kind of dumb on their part but I contacted them and that's what they told me.So all in all, this is well worth the price.Note; I paid 56$ at the time."
5,Everything I wanted in one cute package,"After looking at numerous cookie cutter sets I was starting to think I would have to purchase several different ones to get the assortment I wanted. When I found this set I was thrilled! It had all of the different cutters in a cute tin box that I know will last over the years. Great product,will definitely buy from this company again."
5,"Stays put, even around sharp curves.","I love our Street Pilot, but hated the sticky mounting device that came with it. This sand bag mount was the perfect solution. It stays put wherever you set it, and doesn't slide when making sharp turns. It also allows you to quickly reposition the Street Pilot for other drivers (or to stash it under a seat). Best of all it doesn't leave any sticky residue on my dashboard the way the other mount did."
3,"fyi, no battery case",FYI. Another review said this bean bag mount had a case for batteries. The one I just got here does not have this.
2,slanted portrayal of the state of reseach,"This book is rather naive and overoptimimistic with respect to the state of consciousness research today. It's not that bad of a book for its point of view, but given the title a more balanced approach would be more appropriate. To create this balance, read this book together with Horgan's book on consciousness, or if you want something even more penetrating, read any of McGinn's books on the subject."
1,Keep Looking,I haven't noticed any improvement. I had used a vit. K cream previously that seemed to reduce the darkness under my eyes. This one does not. Just a nice moisturizer.
2,Ponds afe defEYE anti- circle anti-puff eye therapy,"The product is okay, nothing great. Doesn't live up to what it's suppose to do. I wouldn't buy it again."
4,refreshing,"I have used this product before,but could not find it for a few months. Luckily i found it a amazon, now i will be able to order it as needed. I really think it improves the puffiness & lines under my eyes. Its also has a refreshing lift..."
4,Woodies & Wagons,"Great book to add to your collection.A must read and along with great photo collection of classic woodies.If you like this book you need to get Classic Cars ""Woodies a National Treasure"",First Glance Books,Inc.,PO BOX 960,Cobb,CA.95426"
5,Its a filter....it fits,"Air filter fit without any problems. Use this filter on a soldering station location while building products for the Oil Field. No problems, and price was good."
3,its a filter,It removes pollen from air and lasts for about 6 months I think it is too expensive as manufacturing costs are only about a $1
3,Needs Remastering,"The album is cool. I saw SNFU play live in Mankato, MN in 1985, and loved them as a teenager, but in today's world the audio quality comes across as pretty bad. It needs to be either remastered or re-recorded to capture its true awesomeness. If this CD was digitally enhanced to bring out Mr. Chi Pig's voice more, and balance the two guitars in stereo, with the bass and drums in the middle...it would blow your minds even more. Are the original master tapes available? I'll remaster it for free!"
2,OK BUT NOTHING GREAT,"(2.5 STARS) THE BOOK IS WRITTEN IN A QUESTION AND ANWSER FORMAT ON 14 TOPICS. SPEED, POWER, TIMING, TARGET AREAS, STRATEGY, NUTRITION, CONDITIONING, IMPACT, BALANCE, EVADING AND BLOCKING, HAND TECHNIQUES, FOOT TECHNIQUES, TECHNIQUES IN MOTION, AND COORDINATION WITH AN AVERAGE OF 1.5 PAGES OF TEXT ON EACH SECTION. THE REST OF THE BOOK IS PICTURES DIPICTING FIGHTING TECHNIQUES AND STREGNTHINING AND CONDITIONING EXERCISES WITH LITTLE TO NO HELPFULL (DID I SPELL THAT RIGHT) EXPLANATIONS ON HOW TO PREFORM WHAT THE PICTURES ARE SHOWING. TO A NOVICE MARTIAL ARTIST THIS BOOK MAY JUST PROVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN WORTHLESS, A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND A WASTE OF YOUR TIME. BUT TO A SKILLED MARTIAL ARTIST LIKE MYSELF IT JUST MAY BE WHAT YOU NEED TO JOG YOUR THINK TANK AND HELP YOU COME UP WITH YOUR OWN IDEAS TO HELP YOU IMPROVE YOUR ART OF FIGHTING."
1,Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!!! Are you kidding me or what?!?,"Training and Fighting Skills....NOT!!!! A noble effort but no cigar. A defeated ""kickboxer"" who explains how to lose. Poor Beeny lost to not 1 but 2 Muay Thai fighters. These losses were written up as ""No Contest"". For the Muay Thai guys I'm sure it was no contest. His fighting skills and techniques are regurgitated information on what doen't work. This book was an insulting attempt to become some kind of pseudo-expert in the ""Ally McBeal"" world of kickboxing. If your looking for a great book on REAL kickboxing then do yourself a favor and buy ""Thai Boxing Dynamite"". Better yet get ""First Strike"" a top notch book on the reality of real-world fighting. Both are great books on real fighting!!"
4,Punk Rock 2004,"For those whose dalliance with punk rock in the late-70s had more to do with musical adventure than social rebuttal, it may be surprising to learn how vital this music remains so far out of the mainstream spotlight. But then, the same has probably been said numerous times of rock 'n' roll more in its 50 year history. These 27 tracks, culled by Duane Peters (ex-U.S. Bombs, current Die Hunns) from over 1,200 demos show punk rock to be alive and well, if not currently the focus of MTV's (nonexistent) video rotation. Unlike the first volume in this series (a 2000 issue on Alive, and including the likes of Rancid and JFA), the bands anthologized this time pop up from deeper in the underground. The songs include a lot of variety, from melodic punk and skatecore to sophisticated post-punk sounds."
2,Disappointing,Very flimsy construction and action figure has very limited movement... Overall I can understand whythis product did not sell well initially.
5,Happy with this system.,System works and performs well. Seems to be good quality.I had a plumber install. Billed me for 1 hour.Very happy with system. And... no more bottledwater.
4,Works great,"We have a well that has heavy sulfur, hard water, and iron. The water from this unit is great drinking water and much easier on our small appliances."
1,All parts are not equal.,"I order this mortising kit think nothing could go wrong, What a mistake!!! WOW When I first recieved it I tought this will work great, but in checking the parts I found the mortising chisel bits where the wrong size to fit in the yoke that attaches to the drill press. I call Grizzly Co. and they said no problem we'll send you the correct set of bits right away. So, after about a mouth I called again, this time they explaned to me that they weren't sending the bits but they were sending me a new yoke to fit the bits I have and it was shipped two days ago. So, after two more weeks I recieved the new yoke. But now the alignment pin for the old yoke won't work with the new yoke to sit up the bits striaght. I called again and explane the problem to them so now they are going to send me a new alignment pin. Ten days later I recieved the new pin. Why is it that the Grizzly Co. has not gone out of business yet???????"
5,Good low budget mortising attachment,"Compared to a bench top mortising machine, the Grizzly H7789 is just as good and a lot cheaper (if you have a drill press of course). All the pieces are powder coated and well machined beefy cast iron. The fence and mortising cone went on my bench top drill press (Ryobi 10 inch DP102L) with no problems. It drills a perfect square hole every time."
4,COOL MUSIC!,"I love lolly, her songs are soooo cool.I think this song is pretty good.But I do think it sort of lacks originality, and it gets a bit boring after listening to it for a time."
3,would be better in capsules or tablets.....,"I've been taking this for two days. It says in the bottle to give it 3 to 4 days to make you feel better. I am in my 12th week of pregnancy and my 6th with terrible nausea. I do think it has helped a little, though I hope it works better within two more days. The first day it made me feel terrible, wanting to vomit, because the taste is too sweet for me. I really hope they had this in capsules to avoid tasting it."
5,Gave character to my all black gun cabinet.,"12.5""x16"" size makes this a nice eye catching piece. The image is printed clearly. The tin sign itself is solidly made and folded on the sides with no sharp edges. Each corner is punched to take a tack/finishing nail."
4,Amazing Japanese Drums,"The track, Shake, all by itself is worth the price of the album. The album is a rhythmic journey; hypnotic, intricate, other worldly, yet very much Japanese."
4,Driving the Beat,"Kodo's performance on this album is not up to their usual high standards. While the Celtic influences are still there, the driving, pounding emotion which is usually found in Kodo's music is lacking."
2,Nonstardard Cabling,"What put me off on this item is the way the ports are configured. My keyboard, video, and mouse cables are preinstalled and not compatible with theirs. So, this item is sitting in my spare parts bin along with its cables."
3,Doesn't work with common mouse USB to PS/2 adapter,"After reading all the positive reviews, I thought this would be a good choice for me. Unfortunately, I missed the comment that it doesn't work with USB to PS/2 adapters. I have a mouse that has worked with every other KVM switch I've ever seen, an older MS Optical mouse. It has a USB connector that goes into a PS/2 converter.Unfortunately, it didn't work with this switch, so I had to return the item. I haven't seen a plain PS/2 mouse in awhile (but I haven't looked for one either--a quick google shows that they're still around) but I didn't want to buy a new mouse just to use with the switch."
3,There are at least two hardware revisions,"I suspect part of the reason for the varied reviews is that there are at least two hardware revisions of this product. The older and larger ones don't support all of the features on the newer ones, can't have their firmware upgraded, and might as well not exist on the Hawking website. The newer (and physically smaller) revision has updates available for the firmware and software and has a larger range of features.I didn't have any problems with either for plain LPR printing, but they also weren't going into really high-demand environments."
1,"No support, very poorly implemented.","There re much better and easier products out there. Imagine having to send the thing back to the manufacturer because it can't be reset? During config, the first one stopped responding. It can't be reset, so it went back. The second one had driver issues on three out of four windows xp systems.They're all returned now. Avoid this product at all cost."
1,Doesn't work and support is unresponsive,Product installed but then stopped responding after a day. Tried the firmware upgrade available on their website but no improvement.Hawking tech support has not responded after a week. Returning it.
1,Waste of time,Good news is that I Saved my Disk Partition before loading ANY Hawking S/W because I couldnt wait to get rid of all my Hawking S/W. After spending many hours trying to get this Print Server to work I gave up... Returning this today!You would think that Hawking would do something with their poor documentation / install after all the terrible comments about install on this product. Did they ever test this install?Never going to buy another Hawking product!
3,Middle grade quality and price.,"I recently purchased this model because I live in the south where the weather can change quickly.This radio has seven channels, but in the rural area where I live I am only able to pick up one and it is accompanied by some minor static.The radio has a modern look, but the plastic housing is not the highest quality. In fact, the plastic battery door on the bottom does not fit tightly to the unit and I believe it may be a problem over time.The radio comes with it's own transformer, so you won't have to purchase that item seperately. There is also a telescoping antenna attached to this radio, but it is very delicate and should be handled carefully.There is an alarm and a flashing warning light that you can set to go off in the event of an emergency. There is also a test mode, and if your unit is working properly it will get your attention in a hurry.In the final assessment; this radio inexpensive and you are going to get what you are paying for."
5,Great collection of classics!,"A great way to add the top classic sci fi movies to your sci fi collection. It has been years since I have seen these movies, and I rushed to open it and start watching!I would encourage you to also buy ""Silent Running"", ""Logans Run"", ""Day the Earth Stood Still"", and ""War of the Worlds"", among many others.Other movies to consider are all the remakes of the old classic sci fi movies. ""Time Machine (""Time after Time"")"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""Day the Earth Stood Still"", and of course the legendary ""KING KONG"".ENJOY!"
4,Imaginitive,"I remember seeing this movie (2001)in Cinerama when it first came out. It was long and hard for a young man to understand. I'm a science-fiction addict, so this group will add to my DVD collection."
5,"Great ""classic"" movie collection !!!","Was looking for to purchase Forbidden Planet alone but was to pricey and found this collection set at a GREAT price. All the movies are English subtitled, since I have a hearing disability and must get movies with subtitles. These are great reproductions and fun to watch !"
3,Soylent green,Just bought it for a school assignment....Delivery and seller were great! Haven't watched the other movies....maybe someday. Not a big si-fi fan. You'll like it if you bought it because you wanted it!
4,Flash Back!,This was a gift for a younger friend. Wanted to know what Soylent Green was all about. Very 70s.
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"Three of these four old ""spectacular"" movies were mostly overlong and tedious, but still highly rated for some reason. Only the Time Machine is worth seeing again and again. I had the VCR version of the Time Machine for many years as one of my favorites. I bought the DVD mainly to have it on disk. The other three I had seen in theaters years ago and had mostly forgotten the details. I was not pleased with the time it took to remind me of how boring these can be. Buy the Time Machine and forget the rest."
5,Quick Reference for ASP coder,"It provides u a quick reference for ASP objects and components. Properties, methods and collections are explained cleary and simply. Useful examples tells u how to use them smartly.Introduction to ASP let u take a quick review of both ASP and its history"
3,Hard to use Reference,"I'm a bit disappointed by this book. To use it as a reference, it is too incomplete, some methods just aren't explained. A reference of VBScript is also missing and overall there is little information to get the big picture of how asp works. So as a beginner you will miss basic informations about ASP, as advanced programmer you will get angry when you find out that exactly the function you want to look up isn't there."
4,Only partially updated for IIS 5.0..,"I'm not sure I can add much to the other reviews here, other than to state that the book is only partially updated for IIS 5.0 (Windows 2000) in my opinion. Nearly 30 pages are devoted to coverage of CDONTS, none of which will operate on any out-of-the-box Windows 2000-based web server I know of.There is zero coverage of CDO for Windows 2000 (a/k/a CDOSYS), which is considerably more powerful and flexible than CDONTS, and in my opinion, represents the ""right"" way to do things for any new code (even if CDONTS is available on *your* Windows 2000 Server).Otherwise, this book is rapidly becoming my favorite ASP reference -- one that's a lot handier than pulling-up the MSDN Library web site every time I forget a property name or method syntax (which is a lot more often than I care to admit in public)."
5,Best book to brush up ASP concepts before moving to ASP.NET,"I was an ASP programmer several years ago after which I moved to a different technology. Now, I need to come to speed on .NET, but unfortunately all the ASP.NET books make innumerous references to the old ASP which I have almost forgotten.The book helped me *VERY* quickly go through ASP 3.0 and now I feel very comfortable reading the .NET books and can now truly appreciate ASP.NET.A GREAT reference book!"
4,Good book for the experienced ASP developer,"This book's strengths are in the brief summaries that it presents for each of the various ASP Objects. They read like small chapters and you can usually find a short example that demonstrates a topic, enabling you to move on with your project.As a reference, you can quickly find the names of all the properties, methods & collections for each object.I gave the book 4 out of 5 because I would like to see a short paragraph in the back reference section devoted to each method and property. Some are given this treatment and others are ignored. I would find a complete reference more useful, even if it added 25 - 50 pages. Still, this is a very valuable book in my collection and the one I would be most likely to carry around with me."
3,Clear but not for beginners,I learned ASP through this book and it was painful. But now that I know what I'm doing I use it all the time.
2,Not for Beginners,"Someone handed me this book when I was just starting out with ASP. It took me days to even figure out where to start! By that time, I was so frustrated I went out and bought a tutorial and started from scratch- since that was still about all I knew after going from cover to cover of this book.While this book can be a helpful reference now, I find myself never touching it. There are plenty of better reference books out there. Definately not worth the frustration."
2,"Get ""Active Server Pages 3.0"" by Wrox","ASP in a Nutshell should have really been titled ""Quick Reference Guide"". And even then, it's not really too complete. I found myself still going to other books or online to find stuff that I really just needed a reminder on, syntax wise."
3,"Good reference and code samples, but...","Somewhat in a rush and while trying to learn ASP I purchased this book. I thought it was aweful and it collected dust for nearly 6 months while I searched elsehwere to boot myself up on ASP. However, now that I'm fairly proficient at ASP, this book has been helpful as a reference. No so much for the actual reference value but becasue the sample code helps put things in perspective."
2,Expectations were discouraged...,"Being O'Reilly has published a great line of publications, I was expecting ""ASP In A Nutshell"" to be a lot like ""Webmaster In A Nutshell"". It is not. In fact, the explanations are a little lengthy. Brief and to the point is what I expect out of a quick reference book. The usage (""example"") code is nice and I do find it beneficial to put the code in context. Overall it's an intermediate level ASP reference guide."
1,This book is terrible! Don't waste your money!,"I am a longtime ASP developer, and I do this for a living. I've read any number of ASP books written by people who don't know what they're talking about, but this one is definitely the very worst. The book is poorly formatted, poorly written, riddled with technical errors, and is a total waste of your time if you a serious developer. I wouldn't waste my money on this turkey."
2,ASP in a nutshell,I picked up this book as my first ASP book ever! Since I have picked up many and just recently this book has become remotely helpful. As a newbie I was very intimidated and confused with this book. And almost gave up on ASP since no fundamentals were discussed. Now since I have a better grasp on the technology I can understand a little better but I still find the structure and long winded explanations to be confusing.
3,Good reference with a few minor errors,"Overall this is a good reference book. Note that its not a tutorial book, so if you're looking for a tutorial on ASP scripting, then you should probably get another book.While reading through this book I did notice a few minor errors, having to do with the core HTTP protocol, but I didn't notice any errors in the parts having to do with ASP.Some material is repeated throughout, especially the explanation of object properties that are collections, but this is to be expected in a reference work. In a reference you want each section to be able to stand on its own, so some repetition is necessary."
3,"For the experienced programmer, not newbie","I had planned for this book to assist more in learning about ASP and use as a quick reference with examples; however I feel that this is for a more experienced programmer that just need a desktop quick reference (as it is sub-titled). I'm never disappointed with O-Reilly books, however I guess I had a different expectation for this book."
3,Not bad if you know what you are doing.,"I would not suggest this book for a novice. It glosses over quite a bit of ASP. However, it does provide nice coverage of the primary objects used in ASP (i.e. Session, Application, Response, Request, etc.). I think the author of the book definitely knows his stuff, but a few more examples would not have hurt. The book reads relatively well. I read the first 7-8 chapters during a two hour flight. I did like the way the author outlines the collections, methods, and events involved with each object. Overall, the book was not bad, but do not buy this book if you are clueless (I suggest Wrox's beginner ASP 2.0)."
1,very weak,it was stated by marc almond not even close some lame rock!! only reason i did'nt return it cost $7 why bother terrible .won't be doin' the amazon thing for awile
3,It's okay but there's a glitch,I have been using this KVM switch for several months and have been irritated by it's one flaw. It constantly moves my mouse pointer to the top or bottom of the screen without warning. This is a common occurrence whenever switching between web pages. I'm shopping for a different brand now.
2,Decent Johnny Winter Record,"This is a decent Johnny Winter record of material from his early days, before he became a famous Blues-Rock guitar player. ""Roadrunner"" pales in comparison to the Bo Diddley version, but ""Kind Hearted Woman"" and ""Low Down Gal Of Mine"" are enjoyable. ""Gangster Of Love"" lacks the power of the Johnny ""Guitar"" Watson original. If you want to hear Johnny Winter at his best, his first four albums are probably what you're looking for."
4,A picture-perfect blend of German-EM and ambient music,"One of the stronger debuts in recent years, this album (from the duo who make up Tacit Blue) features both quasi-Berlin sequencer thumpers and also more floating style ambient/spacemusic pieces. Both of these vastly different genres are executed with great skill and a high degree of imagination. The music is melodic and accessible yet has no trace of being overly slick or commercial. The upside of this is that, unlike a lot of ambient music, this album can be enjoyed right away without waiting for it to ""grow on you"" (which can happen with some ambient CDs); however, the neo-German sequencer pieces do not dominate so the album has a variety not always seen in Berlin school recordings.If you're a fan of electronic music that offers variety, sincerity, and just enough melodic sensibility to keep it from being too formless or droning, Dreamland will fit the bill nicely. With ease!"
2,Skip this one.,"Good:- Small, lightweight- Relatively inexpensive.- Better than not having any shopvac.Bad:- ""Quiet Series""? Compared to what--a KISS concert? I've used a lot of shopvacs in my day, this one isn't any quieter than any of other ones I've used. Using my sound meter, I measured 88 decibels at the end of the hose. A jackhammer is 90 decibels.- The ring that secures the filter element to the motor housing frequently falls off. Once that happens, the room instantly looks like the scene inside a snow globe.- During the first 10 seconds it is turned on, the motor whines and then stops. The problem is likely a bad bearing, so I don't expect this thing to last more than a year or two.If I hadn't received this as a gift, it would have been promptly returned. I'm not likely to ever buy a ShopVac brand unit to replace it once it does die."
4,SMALL BUT STURDY,"WHEN I FIRST TOOK THIS WET VAC OUT OF THE BOX I REALIZED HOW SMALL IT WAS.IT ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE LONG TUBING THAT MOST OF THEM HAVE. BUT, WHEN I STARTED TO USE IT IN MY DAUGHTERS NOT CLEANED IN TEN YEARS BARN I REALIZED IT WAS A VERY POWERFUL AND USEFUL MACHINE. IT NOW STAYS IN MY CAR GETTING READY FOR ITS NEXT JOB."
2,"OK product, but rarely useful","I purchased this item to add to my tech toolbox hoping it would decrease the time to diagnose hardware issues. However I find that a rarely need it. All of the info I need is usually given through the bios beep codes. The times I tried to use it, it was had to see the codes on the LCD and they didn't make make sense once I rigged up a way to view them."
1,for hardcore Ani fans only,"Although I consider myself a fan of her music, I found this DVD to have done a disservice to Ani DiFranco. The picture is often not synchronized with the sound, and the erratic editing, poorly done video effects, inter-cutting of home movies, and chronically skewed camera angles serve only as an obstruction to the performances and interviews. These techniques might have added to the film had they been used sparingly, but serve here only as a constant annoyance. She is credited as co-director, so perhaps she should have entrusted the film solely to a more experienced filmmaker?"
1,ani looses favor,"i have to agree with the post from WA. i was totally let down by this dvd. I purchesed it for a friend for her birthday & HAD to watch it first( because we were such huge Ani fans). and well, not only was i let down by her obvious drug use, but her attitude toward her fans. many people love this woman & are moved & touched by her music. many women [hear her music & it helps them through their day] and i know she is tring to break free from what everyone makes her out to be, and that is what was so wonderufl, but this, this was a let down. Ani do you thing, but i wont be following in these foot steps."
3,Not what I expected,"I thought this would be more of a music and concert DVD. Instead It was a diatribe on Annie's radical left wing politics. She is a very talented singer, songwriter and guitarist and she is certainly entitled to her opinions, but the film would have been much better if she made her points in her songs. At some point you get tired of being preached to."
1,A concert video would have been good enough for me...,"Remember the days that we traded Ani's overdubbed cassettes on college campuses? Most of Ani's fans watched her grow from the beginning. It's too bad that she only sees her sing-a-long fans who are crazy about her music as a distraction. What she had to say about this on the video made me sick. I try to turn my head on the arrogant superstar persona Ani has decided to display, but there's not much else on this video. Ani Difranco is still the most dynamic singer songwriter in the industry today, but this video will not give you a good impression of her act. Save your money for when she comes to your town. Sorry Ani, but you're beginning to remind me of the late 1990's Stevie Nicks explosion. One gold star for effort."
4,Editing included...I loved the DVD,"I thought that the DVD was edited in a manner that coinsides with Ani's style. Although I don't know here engough to make that judgement, I still think it works for her. I didn't think that it was ""annoying"" as one ""critic"" said. It's a presentation and she did a great job. Her music is somthing I like more and more. I have to get use to listening to songs that tell an actual story rather than numb my mind while I drive to work. Some of the songs I even have slight dissagreement with but I like them for that very reason. How fun would it be to be her. Or maybe even a band member of hers? We should all try to control the direction of our lives more and be ourselves.Loved the DVD"
1,"bought vhs, who has vhs. my mistake thought it was dvd","bought vhs, who has vhs. my mistake thought it was dvd blah blah nine more words required ok two more"
1,a good compilation but historically inaccurate at critical,"points. The problem with this reference manual is in certain points when it has to give a history, you have actual misinformation, they say certain leaders were elected when they didn't allow real opposition or the book takes sides in conflicts to the end of offering ""balance"" at the expense of accuracy. A real problem in a book that couldve been better"
5,Solar Fan Thermostat a must have,Do get this! Otherwise the fan will run all the time that it has sun to run the solar roof fan. It was very easy to install and worth the few extra dollars.
3,An analytic approach,"This review is based on the Italian translation of the text.The book portrays each style in vivid and easily identifiable tones: perhaps even too much so as I found myself insterted in all styles but, possibly, for the hysterical one...What was a bit baffling is the use of an ineffable ""normal behavior"" that sometimes appeared as the one projected on a Buddha or a Jesus Christ.Very little, to conclude, is said on how to tackle each style in order to help and overcome it, but possibly that was not in the scope of the book."
2,Mind boggling for those shy at math,"Still ripping away at this one, mainly toilet reading for me. We'll see if it generates any good ideas. hmmmmmmm"
2,Disappointing,"Much below Nolo's usual standards.This book manages to describe the mechanics of a plan while avoiding all of the underlying business thinking.Starting and running a business isn't about the document - it's about the thinking and planning and decision-making captured in that document. This book provides no guidance to the novice on how to really think about starting a business, and is a gross simplification of the process.The accompanying spreadsheets and forms also disappoint, in selection (three very limited sample plans), content, and layout. At least this part would have been so easy to do better. Not a lot of effort went in to this book"
5,It's Like Having an free lawyer at your side:))))),"I was so impressed by this book! I currently own 3 retail stores and I co-op a warehouse. I was looking to expand but many banks would not touch my business based on the current economic issues. This book saved me so much money on advice and attorney fees...Definitely well worth the price. I recommend this book for newbies and pros!Best of Luck,RL MilesChicago Book Closeouts"
3,Good Handbook For Beginers,"This is an easy to read understand book on Business Plan, a good resource for beginners, students and first time entrepreneurs."
1,Be wary...,"I purchased this charger set a few months ago. The DC plugs for BOTH adapters were the wrong size. That should be a simple problem to fix, right? After going back and forth with customer support at Fosman, they determined what the problem was. I was optimistic. However, further communications from me have been ignored. I can't send it back, so I now have two useless adapters."
4,Classic Regency,"The Earl of Kimalton wishes to avoid having his mother pick out a wife for him. His best friend remembers his sister, a special license is purchased, the wedding takes place. A marriage of convenience?The book mainly deals with the way the Earl of Kimbalton who wanted a woman of good sense, who knows her place and Lady Harriet, who has decided and quite strong views come to terms with their marriage. Interesting characters, a quite marvelous and unexpected scene in Hatchard's Bookshop. Needless to say the Earl's life is quite turn upside down by his new wife."
3,Nice watch but........,"Nice watch but it has stopped working on numerous occassions. I am suspect that the battery is old, now I have to take it to a jeweler."
3,how do you reset the chronograph hour dial?,"great watch, love the look, would recommend it.however, i was under the impression that this was a full 'second, minute, hour' chronograph, but, once i start, stop, and reset the chronograph only the second and minute dials reset. I was hoping/needing to be able to reset the hour dial as well, otherwise i can only time for an hour.is the hour chronograph dial just to reiterate what hour of the day it is? seems odd to me...i've tried all the instructions with no success. nautica refers to timex for help, which is useless. ANY HELP?????"
3,"Regular price, 'cause it's a simple watch","This watch looks beautiful in my doll, but is too difficult to change the time and at night it doesn't bright."
3,As good as it should be.,"You get what you pay for. The watch is large, and clean, and seems to do all it advertises it can. Stopwatch is only good for even seconds, but who is capable of reacting fast enough to make hundreds of seconds accurate or useful? Nice design, size,and function for everyday casual use and work. We'll have to see how durable it might be."
4,Great watch,"Love the look of the watch. I take care of all my watches. Maybe it is just me, but the watch bands seem to break easily. I am on my 3rd one. Other than that, It fits well for my needs."
2,el reloj me llego con una seri de detalles,"el reloj vino con una serie de rayas en el cristal y el acero , ademas que vino con un defecto de fabrica en el broche que le impide que se cierre bien sin salirse!"
3,Nice but not awesome - Average for the money,WellThis is listed as a Seiko product but I cannot find Seiko anywhere on the product or the box. I did not take it out to look at the back but........Well it is cute and looks nice to give my daughter for Christmas.I hope it works like a Seiko.Enjoy yours.
4,Gripping Story,"I really enjoyed the Nightmare Years. Mr. Shirer has a way of making the Nazi's reign over Germany come alive. I couldn't put it down, and shared its insights with many. If you like WWII history, and good stories, then this is the book for you."
5,"Review of ""Nightmare Years"" By Wm. Shirer","One of the most informative and factual book on that period I have ever read. Another great book on that period is ""Inferno:The World at War"" by Max Hastings. Sincerely, E.B. Garbutt"
1,This DVD is useless to me to,"I agree with the other one star that this DVD is useless to me, except it works I just wish it didn't. Sooooo unfunny."
1,DVD is useless to me.,"The DVD is not compatible with my Cinco Video Cube Playback System. The system only works with the Cinco VHS Playback System. How am I supposed to watch DVD's? Cinco is a fine company,but rather short sighted when it comes to modern technolodgy. VHS is dead,and Cinco must get with the times. DVD is in,VHS is out. VHS belongs in the dust bin of history."
3,Best work out ever and short!!,"I absolutely love the video...just wish I could get it on a DVD, the tape will only last about a year if used regularly. Bummer."
5,Cool,Love tae bo it's awesome. The eight minute workout is the best and I'd recommend it to anyone with a busy life
1,not happy with with my item,the item was broke when i got it - however it wasn't worth returning (would have cost me more to return then i paid for the item) just discourage me from ordering on line
5,Love it,"I love it! It is small, shiny and looks really good. The only problem is that the only stopper for the hole in the bottom which is also sold by Amazon is a piece of crap that is only plated with stainless steel which wears off after a few months. Love the sink but I sure would like to find another stainless steel stopper for it."
4,So far a good product,"So far this has been a good product. I like the step right above the receiver. The only problem I have is when I am on a bumpy road, the exhaust rattles against the hitch. Other than that it is great."
4,Double check your order!,I messed up and ordered the wrong year. I was able to ship it back and get the replacement very quickly. Once I had the new one it fit just fine. Remember to attach all the bolts loose before tightening. I've used it several times and it works great.
3,Good Receiver - BAD packaging,"My receiver arrived hanging halfway out of the battered and beaten box. It was missing most of the hardware. I called Curtis and they shipped a new hardware kit for free - arrived in less than three days. However, when I went to install the receiver, I found that one of the brackets had been bent in shipping and it did not fit. I had to borrow a large pipe wrench from dad and bend it out while half of it was attached to the vehicle. This drive time to get a tool, the banging, the grunting under the car and cursing added over an hour to what would have been a 20 min install. Installation would have been a snap if the box was stronger and the whole unit would have arrived intact. I still would have bought this receiver, as it was less than half the price U-haul wanted to charge to install the same."
3,Well made,"Does what it supposed to do, the receiver opening has way too much slop in it....shims required.NO lock washers included, just basic nut and bolt...Make sure you pick up some lock washers."
2,Not what I thought!,"Star's book attempts to provide the reader with an analysis of Supreme Court decisions that have been key in American histrory. Unfortunetly, his attempt simply turns into a one sided view. Generally speaking (in Star's eyes), any liberal decision made by the Supreme Court is an overt action of ""Liberal Judges"" making law rather than interpreting law.Star's views are best illustrated by his praise for the ""young"" Rehnquist who believes that Miranda should be overturned. However Star then berates the Chief Justice Rehnquist for subsequently affirming Miranda. All in all, the book falls far short or critically analyzing decisions the court made or the theories onvolved. The book does a good job of lambasting ""liberal"" judges and sanctifying ""conservative"" judges. However, I will give Star merit for a well written book. I would skip this book and choose a more balanced book if you are interested in learning about the Supreme Court"
5,Novelty pig cutting board,"While we like the cutting board for its novelty appeal, for the price we thought it might have been thicker. Other than that, what a great, high quality product!"
2,novelty pig,This is a very flimsy cutting board and really not worth the money. It is more for decoration than use.
2,only for true cow lovers,I purchased this cutting board as a gift for someone who collects cow knickknacks. The board is well made but because of the small size it should be used as a display piece or possibly to use for a cheese cutting board.
1,great..at first,Ive owned the pig cutting board almost a year now. The actual cracks started to appear a few months ago but now it has split in the middle and the lower third has completely racked off at the seam.. I have treated this board as I would any other cutting board and wiped it off with every use with mild soapy water and let it dry on a rack never letting it sit in water. This board is a piece of junk.
5,Tropical Fish DVD,This is a very relaxing and calming video. Our special needs child watches it to relax and go to sleep.
3,Not very practical,"This clip on visor is not at all practical firstly because the UV shield is too long, it covers the whole face and doesn't provide good visibility because of reflections from within, 2ndly it's quite heavy to wear. If the shield were just half of the original would be a lot better."
2,flaky switches - beware,"I bought one of these from Amazon, and it worked well for a while. Then when I'd switch back to the Windows machine, Windows wouldn't recognize the USB ports on the switch. I'd have to unplug all the cables from the KVM and then re-plug them to get the switch to work again. Tech support tried some fixes, and when they didn't work, arranged to have a replacement sent out under warranty. The replacement unit has problems losing keystrokes on the Linux system. So I'm back to the original box while I wait for yet another replacement and also look for a more reliable KVM brand."
3,has some good references.,"The quality of the audio is poor, if youre talking about professional film-making you could think you will see a very professional finished dvd, but has some lack of quality.About content has some good tips for film making, but sincerely I was expecting much more.Its a good reference for begginers."
2,Missing music,I loved the music in the movie and was disappointed that the CD had sound bites from the movie over the music. I really just wanted to enjoy the songs. I'm going to have to individually download the songs to get it without parts of the movie included.
3,Taking a page from the Ramones,"The Donnas play great, straight-ahead punk laced rock. It doesn't have the pure speed of punk, but it's got the energy and attitude. There are a few misses on the disc, and the cover of ""Living After Midnight"" is surprisingly toothless, but the rest is pretty damn solid. ""Midnite Snack"" is one of my favorites, if only for the party-chorus in the background. After a few listens a lot of the songs blur together in a pretty solid blur, but that's just to suggest they aren't fun songs."
5,A great album from a great band!,"A wonderful album! The Donnas have changed their sound since American Teenage Rock 'N' Roll Machine and I love it! Not that ATRNRM isn't a great album, something is different with their sound in this album. It seems that they spent more time with this CD. Whatever the reason, this is a must for any Alternative/Punk/Rock&Roll CD collection."
4,Donnas - 'Turn 21' (Look Out Records),"Been so long since I listened to a CD the quintessential California '90's all-female punk sensation The Donnas. Tracks here that I couldn't get enough of are ""Are You Gonna Move It For Me"", the total ass-kicking ""Do You Want To Hit It"", the luring ""40 Boys In 40 Nights"" [a possibly anthem?], the rocking ""Drivin' Thru My Heart"", ""Police Blitz"" and the girl's well-done cover of the Judas priest classic ""Living After Midnight"". Ideal for old school fans and followers of the Runaways, Pandoras, The Ramones and maybe Kitty (as I finally got to see the long-running all-female metal band play some dive here recently). Other worthwhile CD's by The Donnas include 'Skin Tight' ('99), 'Spend The Night' ('02) and 'Gold Metal' ('04). Very good."
4,Just a Little Crush,"After making a classic album ""Get Skintight"" The Donnas makes an album that made me so interested. This album is good but it has some kind of boring feeling. The songs like ""Are You Gonna Move It for Me"", ""Midnight Snack"", ""Drivin' Thru My Heart"", ""You've Got a Crush on Me"", ""Gimme a Ride"" give some kind of feeling that these girls just make punk music and they have nothing new to give. The lyrics are also very boring...they make music just for music...well it's great that there's is some great punk songs like ""Do You Wanna Hit It"", ""40 Boys in 40 Nights"", ""Play Me Game"", ""Little Boy"", ""Hot Pants"", ""Don't Get Me Busted"", ""Nothing to Do"", and the great Judas Priest cover (from British Steel) ""Living After Midnight"" that it's even better than the original.Stars: 40 Boys in 40 Nights, Do You Wanna Hit It?, Play My Game"
4,Great CD,This is a great CD! I saw the group Tuuli on Comedy Central (as a house band for a stand up comedy show) and accidently ordered the Donnas instead of Tuuli. I was not disappointed. They rock fast and it is great car driving music. Listen to the samples and buy your copy today!
4,Good product,This product works for both the StreetPilot and the StreetPilot color. It does an adequate job of protecting the screen. It includes an elastic tray to hold additional memory cards. I found that it is a very tight fit when including the memory card tray. It is the best case for the StreePilot series that I have found.
1,No Battery Included???? That's unfair!!!,"I just bought this product, and when I received I notice that the Battery and the charger was missing,,, That's not fair for a U$ 1,300.00 item.... Don't you think SONY BOY????"
5,Desperate Tigress,"Thank you Jade Lee, for another thought-provoking read! Your knowledge of China and the period when she was being forced to open her borders to the west is excellent. I love history but the best way to learn it is through an entertaining read. I really enjoy your depth of characterisation and being taken into a world that is so different from anything I know. This book is very sexy but with a delightfully different approach. Highly recommended."
2,Accelerated Testing,"I scanned through the book carefully. It is well written, but stories only. The book does not have the ""hands-on"" that I need."
2,OK - with its own agenda.,"This is an ""ok"" book on how to request a test plan from the author's company, but lacking in technical content for reliability test plans."
2,Needs Improvement,"I have used the maps for Southern New Mexico and El Paso, Texas and found they are not very accurate except on the interstates and major roads. For example, my house shows up as being on a different street. Also, the maps don't show any of the roads that have been built within about the last 5 years."
3,METROGUIDE 2008,"I have used Rinos & metro guide since 2001 v4. the current v8 2008 apparently has a problem where the routing favors freeway/interstate over local roads even when selecting shortest route. I've sent e-mail to Garmin concerning this problem. I'll be reverting to v4 metroguide to establish its the metroguide vs Rino software. The 530 HCX loading of maps via the usb cable is a joke. Have to pull the memory card and use a usb adapter & plug into a PC directly. The 530 HCX otherwise is a dream, but when will we be able to have both topo and metro maps loaded and accessable for the same area?"
1,Red Alert...Not compatible with Garmin GPS III +,The MetroGuide is NOT compatible with the Garmin StreetpilotIII +. I purchased this on reference that other customers who hadbought the Streetpilot III+ had bought the metro guide. Go for Roadsand Recreation! See Garmin FAQs...
4,Don't go for a holiday without this!,"I'm using this with a Garmin eTrex Vista. Been quite useful so far, especially just to keep track of where you are (just about every road, big and small, in the US is in the map) or when you're in a new place and you just want to find the closest Italian restaurant with the GPS of yours. (Of course it probably only works with selected Garmin GPSs)Maps in this CD are about 2 or 3 years old so some new roads will probably be missing. Each city map takes about 7Mb and with the eTrex's serial connection to the PC, it takes ages to upload.Once you finally get over the uploading time, its a bliss. Like you're in control of everything."
3,get more memory!,"It has great detail, but the maps are memory hogs and rarely does a single one coincide with the area in which I'm traveling. The coverage of each map is not logical. For instance, the Knoxville [TN] map reaches nearly to Atlanta, but not to Morristown [TN] less than 45 miles away. I have yet to find a single map that covers the area in which I'm traveling; therefore, I need a 16 meg memory chip so I can download at least two maps to get complete coverage."
3,Garmin USA Metroguide CSD-ROM,"This product appears to improve the accuracy of the GPS by putting the pointer almost on the centerline of the road. The mapping is generallly good, however the maps are about 3 to 5 years behind. The locations of some of the restaurants ect. are off by up to 1 to 3 miles. It will show the address on streets but they are sumetimes off. We use this product both in the auto and aircraft."
5,The real richness of our planet,An excellent book that I whish everybody in the world would be able to see and realize that the real richness we have in our lives is nature. Help protect the last wild places
1,Quite a letdown,"Frankly, I'm quite disappointed in this album. I think this recording is T-bone Burnett's version of Ralph Stanley and not Ralph's version of Ralph Stanley. I don't really know how to classify it...it is definitely NOT Bluegrass and it is surely not Old-time music...it's just downright odd and it makes me uncomfortable to listen to it. I will give Ralph credit for trying something different but you can just hear that he doesn't really know what to think of this music either. Anyway, if I want to listen to Ralph, I'll listen to some of the old Stanley Brothers stuff on King or to 'Cry From the Cross' or 'Clinch Mountain Gospel' on Rebel. As for this album, you can find my in the used bin at the local record shop."
1,Do not buy this Wok,As experienced by another reviewer the non stick POISONOUS coating came off as soon as food was added. Directions were followed exactly.
2,Website no longer exists,"The website to assist students with certain activities is no longer available. So when it says ""check it out"" you can't. I called the company, which has been sold, and they have no plans of re-opening or maintaining a website. They said future books will no longer have that feature."
2,Better off playing outside,"I did not find this workbook relevant to 7th/8th grade curriculm for science or social studies and overall way too basic for math or english at 7th/8th grade. More for elementary school 3,4,5 grade.As far as a ""summer bridge"" I would suggest that you encourage your kids to playing games and activities outside or board games on rainy days than this book."
5,Beautiful Watch,"I just received this watch yesterday and it is quite frankly, the most beautiful watch I've ever owned. I have one other slim line style watch from another company that is too dressy to wear every day and although this watch is gold toned, I will wear it every day along with my every day gold jewlery. The face is extremely easy to read, the bracelet is loose fitting and a beautiful, not brassy color gold. I will be tempted to buy another baby lupah with a leather strap in the future. For now, this is simply gorgeous without being over the top."
5,Quiet; Easy to Install; Includes all screws,"I purchased this ball bearing computer case fan to replace a noisy fan in my tower. With the case closed I cannot even hear this fan run (I have to put my hand at the exhaust to feel for air to make sure that it is running). For the price point, I decided that this was the best replacement for me. Installation was easy, especially because all of the screws that I needed were included.To make sure that the fan will fit your case make sure you check the schematic included in the product pictures."
5,Great little case fan.,The item is exactly as described in the title! A case fan failed in one of my computers and this one worked as an exact replacement.
5,Good Dell Replacement fan,Great replacement for case/processor fan on many dell dimension units with green processor shroud (fan = nmb 3612kl-04w-b66). You will have to scab in the connector from the old fan (solder or wire nuts will work). Extremely quiet.
1,"will not work in ""Q""",This card fits a Motorola Q but will not work in it.I dont think it's the fault of the card but the phone is not capaable of accepting the installation and running the card(maybe voltage problems?)
2,Absurdly overpriced!,"My worst investment in BW books so far. It is not more than a pamphlet, with very low quality figures (print screens almost impossible to read).I expected much more from the price I paid."
1,Why is this classed as a books and not a pamphlet?,"OK, so size isn't everything. But for the price of this A5 pamphlet, you could buy an encyclopedia sized book on the same subject.Don't think the bigger books are competition for this one, though. They're designed for people who want to learn a subject and are prepared to put the time and effort in to do so; the target market for this comic is the kind who just want to parrot off answers in an interview."
2,Overpriced,"The book is good when you need to do a quick self-examination or pick questions for the interview.However, I think if you've already got $60 to spend, it would be better to add another 20 and buy something more solid."
5,This girl will be a household name one day.,"I heard Sara in Dallas last weekend, and she has it. That special star quality and all the talent to make it big - remember this name - you'll hear it often someday. In a sea of no-talent singers in the mainstream these days, Sara is a welcome audition. Don't miss this one."
2,Sorry,"Sorry to disagree, but while I found her voice to be terrific, I thought the instrumentation was dull and the classics plodding."
2,I Was Expecting Much More...,"I was expecting much more from an album with a title called Masada.To me, this is mix of big band disco, a touch of funk and perhaps a shot ofjazz. Even though some mifght call this ""Fusion"", it definitely ain't my idea ofwhat Fusion means. It's Joe blowing his horn in spots with heavy strings andblaring horns backing him up. Most certainly cuts like ""Poinciana"", ""GeminiFlyin' High"" & the title cut would not have been out of place in some 70s'disco palaces. ""Let's Love"" is a slow groover which Ohio Player fans willfind familiar. A taste of Soul-Funk can be found in ""I'm Gone And I'm Glad"" butit's nothing to get excited over. At best this is an average album in all theplaces that really matter. Whoever dared to make a comparison between this catThomas and Grover must've had a problem with his hearing aid. Mr. Washingtonhas nothing to worry about from Mr. Thomas, at least not from anything on thisalbum; and believe me, I'm not trying to be cruel."
4,The Greatest Diva in one of her greatest roles,"Maria Callas, the tigress of opera, remains the most fascinating figure in 20th Century opera. Her own life story was as tantalising and tragic as any of the heroines she protrayed. Among her most famous roles is that of the murderous Medea.The ultimate in evil opera heriones, Medea is not above murdering her own children and when brought to life by the unforgettable voice of Maria Callas she is a three dimensional, realistic woman.This legendary performance teams the diva with another legend, conductor Leonard Bernstein. Together they make Cherubini's long neglected masterpiece come to life. Add to this the tingle of live performance before the often voltile La Scala audience and you have a unique listening experience. This recording is highly recommended for those who love the diva and want to experience what it must have been like to be present at one of her remarkable performances."
4,very good book for applied economics,"very good book for applied economics with many examples and usefull Matlab codes. Very good and useful Matlab toolkit.However, the theoretical side is relatively weak and not covered well."
1,No better than the cheap ones. Complete ripoff,I bought this after initially buying one of the $29.00 ones and being horrified by the picture reproduction. This so called high definition converter is absolutely no improvement over the cheap one it might be even worse. The picture is horribly blurry so even ordinary size print is unreadable. The color reproduction is horrrendously poor a blue backround from your computer monitor is tourquise on the tv. The menu display dissapears if you do not use one of the function within A FEW SECONDS then you have to start over. EXCEEDINGLY ANNOYING. I could not get a signal from the s-video I didn't bother to see if the problem was a defective cable that came with it. If you wan't to get one of these converters get a cheap one for Pete's sake don't waste your money on this one. If you have a PC a video card with s-video out is the way to go. I don't know what the solution is for a laptop.
4,Good To VERY GOOD Electronic Device,"The StarTech PC/VGA to TV converter performs as advertised! The learning curve is not bad and takes someone with an understanding of electronics this is definitely not a device I would advise a NOVICE with no back ground in using moderate to complex connects and settings to purchase. That said I was very happy with the conversion process it very accurately converted PowerPoint files, flash player files and others extremely well."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"This is a poorly written book with an even poorer test bank. It comes with its own page of corrections and that is only to set the tone for the terrible explanations of a difficult subject. If you want to misguide anyone with confusion and sensless cantor, then perhaps it is a buy."
2,proofing,"The 5th edition is basically a draft. There are numerous errors in the book. For example on Page 556: ($2,185+$1,092.5+1092.5+1092.5) somehow yields $5,432.5!? I have a notebook full of corrections are obvious as this."
4,great backup but..,"APC makes the best UPS systems, I have had one for about 7 years and it is still running with no problems.The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the winXP software is not included and tech support is not as good as it should be. You can use native XP to set up for the system to hybernate but some have had some problems with hybernation. I can't seem to get enough info from the tech support as to what their software does and they still have not answered my question as to which software on the website I need. It is confusing since the #'s are a little different for the UPS listed so I am not quite sure which software I need for this particular model."
3,Uhh...,"I bought this UPS, and it failed within a year or so with a bad battery. I sent it back to APC under warranty, and it came back with loose electrical cord, which I fixed myself. I was thoroughly unimpressed with the service."
3,Not what I thought it was,I was expecting a splitter that would provide separate connectors for left and right speakers. This item was for plugging two headsets into one jack.
3,For the Love of Minnie,"With the exception of the recently released Petals: The Minnie Riperton Collection, there aren't many comprehensive compilations on the late soul star. And only a few of her classic solo albums are available as expensive imports. Free Soul, another pricey Japanese import on Minnie, is not an essential one unless you're a die hard fan. It contains full-length versions and a few key album cuts such as ""Feelin' That Your Feelin's Right"" from 1975's Adventures in Paradise and ""Never Existed Before"" from 1979's Minnie. But for some reason you don't get the chart hits ""Memory Lane"" and ""Lover and Friend."" Sound quality isn't bad, but the liner notes are in Japanese. And unless you know the language, you won't be able to read 'em."
3,Model 21 No. 10 lashes,The lashes are natural looking but the #10 are way too dramatic for me. I have small eyes. I think I'll try #21 instead.
4,Compelling Story,A compelling first hand account of this terrible accident and the needless loss of the beautiful Andrea Dora. One thing I was disapointed was the book has few pictures. The DORIA was one of the most drop dead beautiful ocean liners ever made. I was hoping for more pre accident pictures. If you want first hand accounts from the survivors this book is the last word. If you want to learn more about the DORIA itself look elsewhere.
4,Focus on people makes the story come alive,"Goldstein has taken a well known story and put a new face on it. Those of us old enough to remember the sinking of the Andrea Doria will match our long ago memories with fresh, new information which brings the story back as if it happened yesterday. Those of us who didn't know about this ship will find a facinating account focused on those aboard the ship. The technical details are sufficent; the confusion during the 'desperate hours' are brought alive; the people become very real. I recommend Goldstein's book to history buffs, ship buffs, and anyone who enjoys a good story, told very well."
4,USB is Possible,"As a certified Computer Technician, I bought a Etrex to connect to a PC i have mounted in my truck, used to play music and display navigational software on a lcd screen. I found out that the software (along with many others) support a connection to a gps device, allowing the software to track your location real time on a map. Very handy, I just set the destination, and it tells me where to go! This cable allows battery free operation, and I hate buying expensive batteries! Although I do agree the cable could be longer, it functions, thus its handy to have. I would like to comment on the usb remarks. I have not tried this yet, but there is a usb to serial adapter available for PC's in need of an extra serial port. Cheers!"
4,Terminals subject to damage,"It's a marvelous idea, but when you're using the plug-in adaptor in your car (particularly a small car like my Jeep), there's a really good chance the PC plug can be damaged by being stepped on or whatever. Perhaps a better idea would be to make each adaptor so that it could be plugged into a socket at the point where they join into the main cable going to the eTrex. That way, you could simply leave each plug inserted into or near its appropriate device. Despite this, potentially serious, flaw the device worked well and was, I feel, worth the money and then some. Batteries do get expensive."
1,Way over priced,"This is a convenient cable to have, but not worth $35. You can get a compatible cable made by Gilsson Technologies selling currently on Amazon for $14.75....Garmin compatible PC Interface Cable with Cigarette Lighter Power Adapter for eTrex Mariner Legend Vista Legend Venture, eMap, Geko GPS (Vista, Legend, etc.)"
3,"may be isolated, but I had a problem","I use this almost every day for 6 to 8 hours. After a few weeks of use the lighter plug in melted and blew the fuse. This could have been caused by a loose connection between it and the cigarette lighter plug. Anyway, I was on the road and couldnt wait for replacement, so I just replaced the end and have had no problem since. That is the only reason for the 3 stars, other than that it would get 5 stars."
5,Garmin PC Interface Cable,This item is an absolute must for operating your GPS unit out in the field when connected to a computer of some sort. Simply relying on the Garmin GPS's internal batteries leaves you with only an eight hour window of operation while if the unit is attached to an external power source one can expect unlimited usage.
4,Functional and Well-Built,"I regularly carry my eTrex GPS from vehicle to vehicle and connect it to my laptop everyday for downloading waypoints and track information. This cable makes it easy to utilize my etrex regardless of the environment. Best of all, the cable is sturdily made and looks like it will last for many more trips. This is also the only cable that will allow you to both power your GPS and connect it to a computer while in a vehicle, as must if you plan on using mapping software in the car."
1,Warranty is not good,"I received a TRS66MF2 as a retirement gift from the AF. This is the most expensive rod I ever owned. I used it a couple of times and caught less than ten fish (total). The largest was a bass about 4&1/2 pounds. On a subsequent cast, the top section broke off about 4 inches above the joint. A clean break with no apparent stress. I contacted the company concerning the warranty and was told I would have to pay $20 each way ($40 total) to return the rod to them for examination to determine if the rod would be repaired under warranty, replaced or if they didn't think they were at fault. I decided that I would put the $40 towards the purchase two ugly sticks at $27.95 each"
4,Vocal perfection!,Toni is in her element here the songs are beautifull and her voice has the range and stylings that are capable of transporting any listener into lush pictures she paints with her singing! a great addition to any collection
1,please... don't ever do it again...,"Toni is not a jazz singer, never will be, and mcuh like Linda Ronstadt, Toni decided as a last resort to a forgotten and failing career(like Rod Stewart), she decided she'd be a caberet singer. Well beign a rock star doesn't qualify someoen to sing standards. Toni sounds more at home on dated funky songs like love will keep us together but on these swing standards ,well how other can i say it but, she lacks any sense of swing, or individualism.Skip this one, and if you need a Toni fix, buy one of her greatest hist packages, but she's no good at standards"
3,California sun damages it!,"A reasonably good cover it fit my car well. Came with a 4 year guarantee but after less then 3 years the fabric was severely damaged in areas where the sun hit it head on, like the top, hood and windshield area, The elastic that is at the front and rear to hold it on the car became unusable after about 18 months so I pressed brass grommets into that area and used a nylon string to cinch it under the front and rear of the car. Worked very well. I think it is a good cover but did not live the guaranteed 4 years in Southern California. In my case the cover was on the car essentially all the time as the car is seldom used. Amazon replaced it no questions asked. I am a great believer in Amazon!"
5,Great CD from a Great Player,"C. Buggs Coombs has hit the seen with a masterful CD. This is a great mix of original songs that reflect the experiences of a true small town Country Blues man. But don't get me wrong, this album has that big sound. Masterful song writing accompanied by great players all on a very professional recording. The Tone Chaperones are on the rise as C. Buggs drives his stake in the ground on the big time. A must for anyone who likes that down home country blues sound palyed from the heart."
1,This is rubbish,"I bought this CD on the recommendation of a reviewer and I suppose the title. I thought it might be a mix of all the music types mentioned. Believe me it is not. This is some of the most insipid music I have ever heard. The favourable review must have been a relative. I can almost hear those duellin' banjos! The playing, the singing is not very good. I was almost embarrassed when I played it."
5,Educational fun,"My daughter received this book for her first birthday as it's in November close to Christmas. This is her favorite book besides Dreamland. She doesn't care much about the tabs like other reviewers kids. She is into learning ""wassat?""""wassat?""""ornaments!""""orment?""At 18 months old she knows every word in this book as well as the objects that dont have words. and can say them all. She's gifted, I'm telling y'all. She loves words. I love that there are so many every day objects in the pictures that she can learn, too. Not just Christmas stuff.We play ""Show me the..."" several times a day. I ask her where something is on the page, then she points to it. If there are more than one of that thing, I ask wheres the other chair, glasses, girl, etc? And she looks all over the page until she finds it! Like where's waldo!She especially loves to show me the Panda bear.5 stars!!"
5,great for kids,"seems to have good educational value. slightly different from other fkipl books i have ordered. my used copy has a few torn pieces :(, but the product itself is great."
5,Perfect for an 18 month old,"This book has vibrant colors and lots of fun flaps for little ones. My daughter, who is 19 months old, really likes this book. It keeps her occupied in the car."
4,Awesome book for toddler,"My son just loves this book, he brings it to me every night and has so much fun opening all the little secret doors. It's such a cute bonding book that will help the little one sit and enjoy reading time if he's normally a busy bee."
4,"Very Nice book, but may be too much...","This is a very fun, colorful book for the holidays but the number of flaps and the smaller size of some of the flaps may be a bit too much for littler fingers. But overall, a good holiday book."
5,Great book!,"Across the board, I recommend all of the Fischer Price Lift The Flap books. My son really enjoys these."
4,Tons of Pull Tabs,"My son is 2.5 and seems to rank this book as his 4th favorite of the Fisher-Price pull-tab books. The book has the most tabs by far but I don't they are as educational as the other 3. Also, it is great that is a Christmas book but it feels a little strange reading him this book in July. However, if you are looking for a great book to teach a young one about Christmas in a fun way, it is great."
5,Should Be Required Reading in Every U.S. High School,"If people only knew the Eden that existed before the birth of our present generation, they might yet understand what it is we are currently taking away from future generations. This book changed my life - it changed my value system. It has a place forever on my bookshelf. How one reacts to the information contained in this book says everything about ones individual character. Not only is it a sad choronology of the death and destruction of life in North America, it is a terrifying indictment on the collective psychology of mankind."
2,Quality product - not fit Sienna 2011 as stated on Amazon site,"Do not buy this for Sienna 2011. Amazon said it fit, but it will not. 3 inches longer is not fit. Returned for a refund. The product is good built. I have the same brand for 2006 Camry and that fits perfectly."
3,Regular,The watch is nice although the strap material is impossible to clean. I recommend buying the one with the black strap.
2,Watch is fine...but NOT a true RED band!,"Returned this watch!! Color of band is misrepresented.Not a true red, which is what I wanted! Actual color isred orange. Ordered another Nautica watch which was tohave a deffinite red band, but it was the same. Thenordered a black band from Nautica & replaced the socalled red band. Sometimes, red is NOT red!"
2,NOT what I asked for. I asked for the millinium tree NOT the tree of peace,I didn't get what I asked for.... I was expecting the millinium tree NOT the tree of peace. There is a difference....
3,"Fun, quick read","Katie's stepfather has just died, and she, her mother, and step-brother move to a fictional small town that I gather is in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. They will be living with and taking care of Uncle Frank, who is actually no relation to them. Newquay is a former mining town that is currently almost dead. The mine had collapsed 30 years prior, killing several men and giving rise to tales of `knackers,' the ghosts of miners, turned evil and trying to tunnel their way out. Katie does see a ghost, but it's not a miner and doesn't seem evil, either. Actually the ghost is quite helpful. Other issues explored in the book include Katie's stepbrother Jay not feeling welcome in a family that no longer includes his dad, and so becoming a trouble-maker in an effort to get sent away.A fun, quick read. Interesting incorporation of local lore and Cornish customs. Ages 9-12."
2,Boring!,The book was to slow and never really picked up.The Readers want exictement not boredom i give it 2 stars on account of it being to SLOW!
4,This is a great book,This book will keep you on the edge of your seat. I had fun reading this book. If you want ghosts and more get this book.
5,"Does exactly what it's supposed to, perfectly",Playstation 2 + This + Computer Monitor with VGA input = WINPlaystation Portable + RCA cables + This + Computer monitor with VGA input = MORE WIN
1,Bugger,My girlfriend and I have a spare DVD player that we were using before we moved as well as an LCD monitor. We wanted to hook both of them up in the bed room so that we could watch some DVDs. This product worked great for about three days (though it did over saturate the color a bit) and then it would start to flicker a little bit... then a lot... then it would loose color and only be in black and white. Then about two days later it went back to color for a few hours before it started flickering again. I returned this product and I'm going to try a different one (hasn't arrived yet)
1,Don't Buy This,"Straight up do not waste your money on this product. I bought the Video Game Jockey in order to play my XBox 360 on a computer monitor, and the quality was absolutely terrible. Furthermore, the audio/visual lag was still a problem. Afterward, I bought a cable made by XBox that plugs into the console and goes to VGA. This cable works beautifully and preserves picture quality very well. It also helped to eliminate A/V lag. You should be able to buy the cable at any Best Buy or large electronics store."
2,StarTech Game Jockey,"Was really easy to install and use. The Big Problem is that the sound does not WORK. This is the second one and they both have the same problem. There is no help with instructions, like troubleshooting. This is the last one that I will return."
4,Good except whine,It is excellent at converting from the AV cables to the VGA so that a computer or projector can be used to play the video game. The one I received has a small whine when I connect any speaker device to it though. I don't know if that is standard for these devices or just a fluke with mine. I would recommend this product as long as I informed the person of the possible sound whine issue.
3,It's just OK...not perfect,It works...but the quality is not too good. The video is bit fuzzy and the sound has a bit of a hissing sound in the background. Its just a simple box that gets the job done...just don't expect too much from it.
3,Game Jockey,"The Jockey is somewhat ""cheap"" in that it feels like it will break any moment. Besides this, it works well, although my computer monitar has lines that run down it because of the Jockey."
1,Please do not waste your money.,"Simple and short. This product claims to provide superior video quality. IT DOES NOT!!! Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, poor video. Not what I expected at all. Someone must have already returned the item once because it shipped from Amazon's return dept. Well I am sending it back there!"
2,Junk,"Frankly, the adapter does what it says. I connected my PS2 to my 17 inch LCD monitor. The graphics felt ok .. nothing gr8 but I had to adjust my monitor settings. I don't have any problem with that (although I was disappointed since it meant changing the settings everytime you toggle between PC and PS2). Additionally, I would have liked longer cables. Thats fine too. The thing which really [ticked] me off is that when I connected my PC and monitor to the adapter, I was not able to get input from PS2. I tried but my monitor kept saying ""no signal"". Now this can be a problem with my monitor settings but it worked fine when I connected my PS2 separately. And the box said its just plug and play. Well I plugged and it didn't play. So its going back. I will have to pay restocking fee for this junk but atleast I will save 40 odd dollars. Also I was not too happy with the display quality."
1,Burned out my monitor,"When I connected this device between my X box and Sansung 21"" svga monitor, the display would occasionaly blink from a black screen to the normal display about once per second. After 30 minutes, the monitor stopped working and is currently being repaaired. The service man said the box most likely was outputing incorrect voltages and/or frequencies to the monitor."
1,Poor Quality & Service,"I purchased the HWR54G RevM from a local store, and it worked great for a day, then the radio signal started bouncing from great to none, and after allowing it to ""Rest"" for a couple of hours it worked, but the radio signal then started bouncing. I sent it to Hawking and they sent me a replacement, and it did the same thing.I'm asking hawking for a refund. This is junk, and they obviously don't test them."
1,HWR54G is the worst possible product invented,"One Word. Do not buy this unless you want to waste money and tons of time.This router did not connect to the DSL modem even after repeatedly programming the modem in bridge mode. And if you have a regular full-time job, the tech support is non-existent, as they are only available during weekdays 8am-5pm. If you have free time during weekdays, make sure to set aside half a day, as they will put you on hold for at least an hr, and then provide you with very rude and unprofessinal, useless support.(...)"
2,OK if you don't want wireless,If you are using this unit as a wired router it's not bad. The wireless is VERY bad. I could not get a good wireless connection to a laptop six feet away. I am sure the problem was not with the laptop because several laptops were tried. Do not buy this product or you will be disappointed. I just replaced the Hawking HWR54G with a Linksys E3000. I can now get hi-speed wireless anywhere in the house with very easy set-up. I realize the Linksys is in a different class but spend the extra money. You'll be glad you did.
1,very poor performance,This is the poor quality wireless router ever i have seen. signals drop very often. technical support also very poor. i suggest not to buy this router.
1,Dropped my connection constantly,"This router dropped my connection constantly.Always need to restart the router for unable to connect.Try with 5 different wireless card but same unstable result.I put my old wireless router back, all connection back to normal and stable."
2,pathetic wireless function,"I took over as an IT manager position for a small company and inherited a HWR54G router. We had a fully functional Linksys WAP11B working but I thought it would be a better idea to utilize the wireless G because of the speed. After replacing the WAP, I noticed that we were getting 54 Mbps instead of the 11 we were getting with the WAP ... but my elation was short lived. It would cycle from 54 to 1 at any given time, regardless whether I used Windows, Intel or Belkin to control the wireless function. We have 3 notebooks, 2 that are about 60' away and one that's about 12' away. It doesn't matter which notebook I'm working with, the result is still the same. I went back to the Linksys because it's reliable and the 54M went into the trash ... probably where it should have been in the first place."
2,Songs are not as listed for this CD,I wish I had read the reviews for this CD. It only has 12 songs and not the ones listed here. You'd think with the previous comments about this list being wrong that Amazon would correct the list. I didn't read the reviews until after I bought the CD and found out that the songs on it were completely wrong.
5,Love her style,Noelle has a friendly down to earth presentation. She doesn't waste time between exercises. Her instructions are simple and to the point. Noelle makes Pilates so easy to understand. The exercises don't require acrobabic ability to perform but you can really feel them working. I am thrilled with the results. I have a smaller waist and more flexibility than I have ever had despite years of weight training and I am 58 years old. I highly recommmend Noelle's Powerhouse to everyone. I have tried several other Pilates workouts and this is by far the best.
4,"Workout - good, instructor a bit annoying, though","I've tried three pilates tapes and this one is BY FAR the best. The other two ones i've tried were 'pilates-lite' to the point that you couldn't tell if you were doing *anything* to your body. This, by contrast, is a quick tape (30 min) but an effective pilates workout. Some of the movies are too basic for a pilates advanced beginner or intermediate, but if you've taken a few classes you can substitute the harder variation pretty easily. My only complaint about this tape is i don't really care for Noelle. I do pilates once a week in a pilates studio where focus is on form, agility, and grace. Noelle, by contrast, keeps peppering her workout with comments like 'feel your buns shaping up!' and 'streamline your bodies, ladies!' as if it were an aerobics classing. This was very off-putting to me. I think next time i do the tape i'm going to proceed with the sound off."
5,Great everyday workout,"I bought this video on the advice of others on Amazon, and I must say I have been very pleased. This is a great everyday workout, with a nice mix of exercises to leave you stimulated. All parts of the body are worked. I have tried some other Pilates videos as well, and I think this is the best."
3,"A decent video, but too short for the price","This is a 26 minute Pilates mat workout. Good for travel because you don't need much room or any equipment (other than a VCR), but at $20, I don't see it as a value, really. Also, any seasoned instructor should realize that it is much easier for us to follow her if we mirror her movements. Noelle tell us what side she is using, not the side that most (if not all) will use when watching her on our televisions. Not important, just a pet peeve."
2,scratches the flashlight,"I have three bikes so rather than maintain a headlamp for each, I purchased three of these for use with this excellent flashlight [...]Unfortunately, the Wald Flashlight Holder is simply bent metal. It scratches the nice flashlight when I take it in and out. I'd have preferred better quality holders (even for a higher price)."
3,Just O.K. product.,"This flashlight holder is basic type of one. Lightly painted spring steel, no protective surface to prevent scratching of a good metal flashlight or gouging a plastic one. Is okay for holding a cheap plastic light in emergency area, but don't use it with your MagLight or high quality waterproof plastic one as you will damage finish of them."
3,Not a good fit,This cover does not fit a 93 Mustang it is much too big and they said it would fit. It is a good quality cover but now I have to return it for another one and I hope this one fits.
2,Terrible Fit,"I now know what a ""semi custom fit"" is. It means it doesn't. It means something close enough is rolled into a box and shipped. A storage bag is not included, nor is the promised antenna grommet. This cover is supposed to fit a Jaguar X-Type, but it's sized for something closer to a CAT. On the plus side, I do not have to purchase a motorcycle cover as it will fit under there too."
1,Mindless,"I ordered this movie hoping to have a movie that was an inspiration for students about mathematics -I am always trying to engage students in math. This movie is so poorly written, it is beyond words.I cannot even imagine someone producing it.It is bizarre, with a story line that is totally insulting to any math or science teacher. The characters in this movie are not even close to reproducing a snapshot of a mathematics teacher.I watched it for a much longer time than than I wanted to do so- hoping for something that would be redeeming. There is NOTHING.Better throw the cost of this movie down the toilet. This movie is so disgusting and totally insulting to teachers and math education.Not worth buying at any price."
