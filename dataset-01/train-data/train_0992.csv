4,good for you,I like this tape. I started this tape and saw results fast.I like the low rep overload style of weight training. You just increase your weight as the exercise becomes easier.You need quite a few different size weights to chose from. It shows Beg. thur adv. moves. If you do it 2 times a week as Kathy recomends you'll see results.I am in good shape and this tape helped me get there. The only thing I feel thats lacking is the abs section of the tape. After a few months they just were not challenging enough as you can't add weight to make it harder like the other exercises. Still its a great tape. A step makes one set of exercises easier in my opinion but Kathy uses a large pillow. I also liked the set on this tape and the music didn't sound like a video game. Happy Flexing folx
3,Fair movie!,"This movie is action packed, but a bit too violent for my liking. Not quite what I expected. Judge for yourself."
1,Very slow movie.,I watched about 45 minutes of what was to be a fast action movie. Very very slow for the first 45 minutes.I simply chose not to finish watching.
2,"Starts out good, but...",Some mountaineers went mountaineering. This was good.There was beautiful scenery. This was good.They found and rescued a little girl. This was good.People started shooting at each other in the woods. This was not good.People started shooting at each other in a town. This was not good.It's too bad this movie started out so promising then went quickly downhill. After the first twenty minutes or so nothing of any importance really happened.
3,it ok,it ok however it does look better in person than in the photo. my only complaint is that the part that hold the glass was a bit off-it wasnt level so i had to bend it a bit to get the glass to sit level- which only worked a little bit- i was afraid to break it so i didnt bend it any farther.
1,undersatisfied,"After getting this oil burner in the mail, it did not really look anything to me as it did in the picture. That and it was bent. Since I had ordered two different oil burners, I returned this one. The other works great."
4,Nice piece,"I was looking for something to use with wax tarts I got for Christmas, and this fit the bill. I like the look of it and have gotten several compliments. I would recommend this to anyone!"
4,Gift for my daughters,They seems to like them - pretty durable and seem to be well made - I would buy them again but I am using plugin type not
3,"good, not great","this product came quickly, and looked exactly as described. The base is sturdy and solid. However, I gave this on thursday as a gift, and by saturday, the glass had cracked from being over heated. In all fairness, she loved the burner so much that she used it quite a bit. But it was used as per the instructions, so with that in mind, it should last for years, not days. If the glass hadn't broken, I'd rate this as five stars. Maybe the candle sits too close to the oil dish?"
1,Oil stains!,"Used as directed and while in other room heard pop and I then found oil had splurted onto my wall, table and rug. The glass gets way too hot with use of tea candle. Manufacturer needs to raise the distance between glass and candle holder. Now I'll have the expense of having wall painted before I move. Very unhappy."
4,Can Water Be Thicker Than Blood?,"Rachel Chavez is a survivor. In spite of her father's lack of support, his loss of the family farm and fortune, her mother's death, and her own addiction to drugs and alcohol she is determined to make the Park-Rite Garage her grandfather built and left to her a success.She works hard to keep her clients happy, taking delivery of packages brought to her helicopter pad, opening cars with the keys inside, changing tires, and generally babysitting their expensive vehicles while the work. But when she finds a car that she suspects could have been used in a hit and run, it starts a ball rolling that gathers no moss, but does gather bodies, all of them dead. And it looks like someone is trying to add Rachel to that number.Penny Rudolph has done it again. She has built a world of grim and crime around a gutsy woman struggling to survive in spite of the odds against her, and still be a lady.Reviewed by Wanda C. Keesey"
5,A classic on dance and romance,"This was the first movie I saw of Astaire and Rogers, when I was 13, watching American Movie Classics (AMC). It got me hooked! After watching all the rest of the movies made by Astaire and Rogers, it remained my favorite (Shall We Dance is a close second). It contains a fascinating true story, romance, and many glimpses of the beautiful dancing duo. In fact, Astaire and Rogers dance more smoothly and unified in this movie than any of the others. Of course, it would be expected since it's one of their last. Anyone who is a die-hard romantic must get this video!"
5,A new fan,"I got this for my wife and really have enjoyed these films. I took a film history class in college and enjoy these from an historical perspective, but they are fun films. No language, no inappropriate behavior, just relaxing fun.Why can't they make movies like these anymore?Thank goodness for DVD's."
3,"Astaire, Rogers, and the first Tom & Jerry cartoon","This is not my favorite Astaire-Rogers movie. Their connection with each other was never more touching, but the dancing -- recreating the specific steps of the Castles -- by definition doesn't have the ingenuity that makes Fred & Ginger so special.However, there is a feature on this DVD, that is interesting: 1940's Puss Gets the Boot is the first Tom & Jerry cartoon. Though the cat is named Jasper and the mouse is unnamed, this first pairing of directors Hanna and Barbera became so popular (the toon was nominated for an Academy Award) that the characters' names were changed and the series was officially born one year later."
5,Up in my favorites,"This is almost my favorite Fred and Ginger movie (""almost"" because Fred doesn't do his original, more interesting dances). That said, I believe that apart from a few mildly awkward romance scenes, Fred does incredibly well in straight acting, and I wish that he was put in more roles like this one as Vernon Castle. There wasn't as much silliness and the plot was stronger as well. Although very different than his earlier movies with Ginger, I have to say that The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle rates up with Top Hat for me."
5,Thanks for the List for Season 7,"Thanks to the poster below for posting the list of season 7 eps, I just placed my pre-order. These are really good ones, with more Jessica than S6. Looking forward to this!"
1,Returned Product to Sender,I had to send the dvd's back to England. They will not play on DVD players in the United States. I am waiting for my refund. I am thoroughly disappointed.
5,Gratitude,"Beautiful music, photos, and powerful way to meditate, be inspired, and remember and be grateful our part in this wonderful gift called life. Really supports an attitude of gratitude."
4,Review of Ambler's Cyropaedia,"This translation is incredibly easy to read; I enjoyed it very much. My only complaint is that it uses endnotes rather than footnotes. Even so, the translation is so approachable that one can garner much from this work with little historical background. The introduction is interesting if a bit of a ramble."
3,definitely not history,"This book is a difficult one to evaluate. It is definitely not a history. No human being in history (or even outside of history) has ever been as consistently reasoned, calm, clear-headed, and universally admired as the Cyrus portrayed here. It's a nice little three hundred page homily which in places is fun to read but in others is quite tedious, because Cyrus never seems to perform any action on impulse but always has everything perfectly (and sickeningly) calculated in advance. Even scholars can't seem to agree on what Xenophon's true purpose was in writing this. For me, this book only shows that not all works that are old should be considered ""classics,"" and that sometimes there are good reasons that they are ""neglected"" and ""overlooked."" If you really want to read this book, just read the first forty pages, any random forty pages in the middle, and then the last ten, and you will have saved yourself two hundred pages of reading without missing a single thing."
2,persians were Barbarians and savages in the eyes of the Greeks,"This book is fine as a modernization of an ancient classic but several things need to be understood. Xenophon never intended to write a biography of Cyrus. He was writing an idealized portrait of a long dead Persian ruler. He combined what he knew about Persia, a few facts about the historical Cyrus and a fictional vision of a what he thought was the ideal ruler. The original is much closer to Maciavelli's the Prince in purpose than it is to Plutarch's ""Lives"". So when credit is being given for the wisdom in the book, it must be given directly to Xenophon, not Cyrus. You learn very little about Cyrus and Persians in the original and a lot about Xenophon and Greeks (particularly Sparta, Xenophon's real life ideal.)"
2,not what you may think...,"My apologies to Xenophon, those who liked this book, and those who were intrigued by a book written about Cyrus the Great just 150 years after his reign, but I considered the book a waste and difficult to read as well. Beware, the book is more of a historical fiction than a historical document, like Herodotus or Thucydides. I distinctly felt as if Xenophon was distorting reality and trying to portray Cyrus in idealistic Greek terms, educated, compassionate, balanced, egalitarian, etc, almost as if Xenophon was trying to rehabilitate the Persian Empire's reputation following its defeat at the hands of the Greeks one hundred years earlier. If you like homilies this is the book for you, but if you want to learn more about a great ruler who rapidly and with great skill and talent created a vast empire, there are probably better books to read."
4,A moving personal tale,"You should almost ignore the publisher's blurb for this book. This isn't an adventure story of a valiant teenage freedom fighter, nor a chilling recount of Jews in Nazi concentration camps, nor a ""Do not forget"" shout about the Holocaust.Well, to some extent it is these, but that misses the point. This is one woman's very personal tale of her story through this period. The book draws you into her world back then, and flavors it with the present, tracing her own process of revisiting these memories.It's almost disconcerting how little time is spent dewlling on the horrors, and how matter-of-factly she can recount them. But this is her life, the life of a young girl, and her life contained many things.Come to this book for any of many reasons. You may find yourself staying for others."
2,"Potential, derailed","From Dennis Cooper's ""Little House on the Bowery"" series comes this first novel from Travis Jeppesen. Loosely chronicling the last days of a religious cult called the Overcomers, the novel is composed of fragments of the stories of Tanya, who joins the cult as a pregnant teenager, and of Herbert, her son who leaves the cult before its end. Various other characters appear, including two of Herbert's friends and the man who fathered Herbert, as well as the cult leader Martin Jones. Jeppesen's stark style is quirky and noteworthy, but the story threads unravel as the novel progresses, and by the end, the surreal quality of the fragmentary episodes overtakes the book and dilutes whatever meaning readers are supposed to take from it. Despite my problems with this book, Travis Jeppesen is definitely an author with a future."
3,Not bad but not great either.,"I don't see the Dennis Cooper comparison either on this book.I feel Dennis Cooper is much more controversial.Maybe in the syle of writing they might seem similar but not really.This book was a bit of a chore to finish but I was curious about where it was all going.I have to say I was disappointed at the end for it was too bland but it kept my interest flowing enough to reach it.And I'm sure that that ""has been rocker"" had nothing to do with publishing this particular book. I mean yes it's his company BUT he gave Dennis Cooper the opportunity to publish HIS choices not the company's. It's part of the deal that Cooper signed on with Akashic."
2,Audioslave 2.5,"If you're a fan of Chris Cornell and Soundgarden, I can imagine you'll love Audioslave's newest CD ""Out of Exile"".If you were a huge fan of the hip-hop meets hard-rock band Rage Against the Machine, you may not really like this album.I was sort of so-so on this new Audioslave cd. Nothing really stood out and struck me aside the head and made me take attention. It's good straight ahead rock, but it left me wanting something more.Also, Tom Morello sounds horribly out of place solo'ing on a lot of the songs. This album now sounds like it is truly Chris Cornell's band, not really Rage meets Chris Cornell.Many people may like Audioslave and I can understand why, but for me, this was just alright. 2.5 stars."
3,Separate the singer from the band!,"Chris is great, the band is great... the two are not compatible!Chris should shop around for a better back-up band! His voice is lost in the band's attempt to outdo one another."
2,Lackluster Performance,Im all for bands changing their style but honestly this kinda detracts from the audioslave people came to know.at least for me this album puts me to sleep with those slow soul or bluesy songs. But then it kicks back with some awesome guitars and vocals on songs like Number One Zero....even the lead single is another take on Like A Stone.sometims they sound like Guns n Roses pulling the blues thing (The Curse) and other times they sound like STP (The Worm). The only song that stood out for me is YESTERDAY TO TOMORROW. Simply because of the emotion and guitars incorporated.I suppose they want to break from any comparisons to their previous bands and im all for bands changing their style and with this they lose or win new fans. However this album is not as energetic as their debut. At times it felt i was in a gospel choir. Tnis one suffers the sophomore curse. As boring as the picture on the cover.
2,Highly Disappointing,"I think Audioslave's first cd is one of the cd's I've listened to the most over the past few years. Pretty much every song is great on that cd. This cd though, sounds like they are trying too hard to come up with their own sound. It comes off as too polished and radio friendly, while their first cd was a bare knuckle hard rock masterpiece. Half of this cd is just not good at all. I hope their new album coming out sounds more like the first. I like their newest single ""Original Fire"" a loooot more than ""Be yourself"", which frankly, sounded like they were playing a song for sesame street."
5,Powerful Whallop,"This is a great CD. I really think they took their time to make another CD. Not just pump another one out because it was time... and a lot of bands do this.. and eventually bankrupt their fanbase..It was time. And this band is very powerful. I am glad to hear that AS will be playing songs from both RATM and SG on the tour coming up.As far as the songs on this CD go, my far and away favorite song so far has been 'Doesn't Remind Me'... this nhilistic song is quite good.. and I really love the twisted morality that goes quite well with the twisted guitar solo.But prepare yourself, this is a very hybred, hi octane rock outfit.. and they don't always color inside the lines... which is what makes all great bands even greater.I really love this CD.Have fun"
4,Outstanding Album with Depth and Musicianship.,"Great follow up to what I feel was one of the best albums top to bottom that has been released in the 90's. More than just a fad, I hope these guys continue to make music together for a long time. Songs on this disc are a little milder and have less of an edge than the debut. They show the progression of a group that has a lot of talent. Chris Cornell continues to reinforce the notion that his name has to be put in to disscussion whenever rocks top vocalists are mentioned. Tom Morello is so easy to identify with just a few notes that I'm surprised he is not copied more. Saw them in concert last month. Great show. Acoustic Black Hole Sun and Spoonman with that Rage guitar were the highlights. Hearing Cornell singing ""Killing In The Name Of""and not Zach is still a little wierd. If Zach was smart he would tell the guys from Limp Bizkit to dump Fred, and they could start their own supergroup."
5,AWWWWWWWESOME!,"Another fantastic album by Audioslave, When I first heard Your Time Has Come, I thought Oh Dear God theve screwed it all up, But as soon as it ended I found I was hooked, All the tracks, The Worm, Be Yourself, Dandelion, Out Of Exile, list goes on, didnt actually want to write a full blown review just wanted to mention Yesterday To Tommorow, Dont think anybodys mentioned that yet....Cracking what a bloody tune! Solo kicks ass, All his solo's does, The Worms solo is just Morello all over! WICKED WICKED WICKED!"
2,What a disappointment!,"I am a big fan of Audioslave's first album (it rocks). If I were going to describe the new album I would call it dull and boring. I dont know were they are going with this, but they need to go back to were they jammed."
4,thank god the nineties are dying,"in '92 happened a tragic event in rock music,the boring untalented legions of grunge bands like nirvana took the place of great real talented singers and musicians of AOR,hard rock and real metal bands.now it seems that this musical pollution is going to an end if also tom morello (ratm) and chris cornell(soundgarden) finally decided to play music and not only make some noise for 15yo nerds.this record is nothing to compare to masterpieces like zeppelin,sabbath,journey,whitesnake etc...but is a million time much better than the crap of nu metal rap punk etc...maybe is time of real musicians and real singers again after 13 years of the worst music ever happened on this earth!!"
3,Morello MUST GO!!!!!!!!!,"Okay, I love Audioslave. I was born out of the Soundgarden crowd, and I know how much talent Cornell has. This is why this album pains me so. Morello's tired, predictable, grating riffs and guitar solos are downright ANNOYING. He has become the proverbial nails on the chalkboard. Some of the best songs on the album have these horrible guitar solos/riffs that all but ruin the songs. Their first album was much better, so if you buy this, expect those crummy solo's like you heard on ""What You Are"". Keep your animals away from the speakers.I expect so much more from a band that is playing with Cornell. Their next album will be much better without Morello.Come on, let's all chant: ""MORELLO MUST GO""."
2,What happen???,"I really love the first CD; the vocals, the lyrics, everything, but I don't understand what happen with them. There is nothing new, it sounds like they include here the remaining songs of ""Audioslave"". Is almost the same, but without the passion and innovation. Only two songs could be the exception, but it's almost boring to listen."
4,Pretty Good,"Although Audioslave still isn't as good as Rage or Soundgarden, this album is still pretty strong. This one isn't as heavy as the first but there is some killer tunes on it like ""Your time has Come"" and ""Out of Exile"". Morrello's guitar work is better in this one than the first and the band seems to run a lot smoother than on their first album. I reccomend this CD to Soundgarden fans rather than Rage fans.Score: 8/10"
3,Not your typical audioslave...,"If your looking for more of the same from the first cd you will be sadly disappointed..this album is softer and the lyrical content written by cornell is shakey..how could his fellow band mates let him record such trivial lyrics like ""dosen't remind me""...don't get me wrong i love audioslave and their first album is in my top three of all time but this cd lacks depth..there are some decent songs such as ""the worm"" but overall this album falls short of audioslaves potential..album three will be the true test..."
1,Say No To Supergroups,"This is so sad why people spend money on crap !Be yourself has to be the wrost song ever written.These musician's should retire or get back with there trademark band.Don't support supergroups,If this is gonna be there last ride so be it."
5,Audioslave does what they do best. GOOD Music,From the begining of the first track you get the feel that this is going to be one of the cd's that you will keep the rest of your life. Out of Exile is one of those cd's that you can let play through without skiping a track. A great piece of work in a time were Rock is begining to lose it's luster.A definite must Have!
4,takes a few listens,"Cornell sounds like he is more at the helm of this project than the last one. I don't find him screaming as much either, but that's a good thing cause he can sing ""mary had a little lamb"" and make it sound like the next best thing.""Your time has come"" sounds like an extension of Cochise, but chugs along like a steamroller. Fave's right now would be ""Out of Exile"", Heaven's Dead"", ""The Worm"", and 'Drown me Slowly"". The latter sounding like total Superunkown Soundgarden era.Production is always top notch with Rick Rubin. Everything cranked up to ten but also in the right places.Buy it, you won't be dissapointed. It does take a couple of listens but I can't take it out of my cd player now."
4,damn!!,"I shld've reviewd this a looonng time ago; it's quite, quite good. Audioslave really perfects the post-modern rock sound. Groups like Coldplay and Kings of Leon owe them. Buy Out of Exile. I never skip a song and just about every time i play this disc I play it twice back to back."
5,A great second album--maybe better than the debut,"Audioslave's second record 'Out Of Exile' is an instant classic. Released in 2005 on the Interscope label, 'Out Of Exile' is musically better than their debut. Chris Cornell's vocals are outstanding, and Tom Morello's guitars are worth the price of the album alone.Although many people prefer their self-titled debut over 'Exile,' I am not one of those people. Songs like 'Doesn't Remind Me,' 'Be Yourself' and 'Out Of Exile' are among the band's finest.I never understood why songs like 'Dandelion' never got played on the radio that much. It's a great alternative song, and traces of Soundgarden and Rage Against The Machine show throughout the song.Overall, this is highly recommended to anybody who wants to hear some classic alternative. An extraordinary record that is well worth owning.Highly recommended. ENJOY!!!"
3,Solid but nothing special,"It's a solid album in spite of being a touch dull. There aren't any tracks that really reach out a grab you; nothing that's likely to stick in your mind as a chorus or a melody. Conversley, there aren't any tracks that I would say are bad. A perfectly adequate album."
3,Too much Morello Noise,"Almost EVERY song Tom breaks into his solo of noise making, it's almost like someone from the record company said, alright Like A Stone worked so well, let's make EVERY song sound exactly like it, start out mellow, chorus, build up, chorus, ANNOYING NOISE, MORE ANNOYING NOISE, IS IT ANNOYING YET, back to chorus. They didn't do this with the first record, why this one? I like the first record, all the way through. 04-Doesn't remind me of anything Out of Exile reminds me of like a stone and every song on this disc. The task now, since computers allow us to do the things we can do nowadays, I will take this into Adobe Audition and cut Tom's solos out, then enjoy the album the way it should have been."
3,Not as solid as their debut...,"To all Audioslave fans: 'Out of Exile,'is a decent cd, I just expected better from this band. On their debut album, every song seemed to be a hit, this new cd does not deliver as well. I love Audioslave, they have an original sound and all, but they just didn't deliver with this sophomore album. When I heard their first album, I was like, ""Wow, this is an awesome cd."" When I heard this cd i just shrugged my shoulders. It's decent at best. 'Be Yourself' is the best song on this cd and it is already overplayed on the radio. If you are thinking of buying this cd, I would advise you to find someone to burn it for you.-Airman First Class Bobby Bunch379th ESFS"
1,crap plain and simple,"ok, lets listen to a bunch of pointless songs with horrible guitar mush in the background. CRAP!!"
2,HISTORY REPEALING,"After such unforgettable excitement every time RATM would make a new album or appear on stage, after all these years of unsettled revolution against the things we hate, Audioslave comes up with a boring album, of which 2-3 tunes save the faces of the four rock heroes. Weirdly enough, when I first heard Audioslave (1st album) I had this terrible feeling that it was the end of an era. I will never say ""shame"", just money thrown out of the window. Messrs. Morello & Co., you're out of focus because you try to do something which is not genuine and fresh. Take some holidays and come back!!"
1,Haven't I heard this before?,"Crap! Everything about this new effort is crap. Perhaps the chemistry they had on the first album was just a fluke. The musical compositions sound nearly the same as the first album. The beginning riff on ""Your time has come"" sounds very close to cochise. The lyrics are trite, self absorbed and meandering(kinda like soundgardens last effort). Morello took us down the same ole same ole noise road with his guitar solos. The most annoying quality of this album is the sound, it's flat and lifeless, the mixes are blase, muddy and totally lacking in edge.I don't see anything redeeming about this album. Perhaps they should've stayed in exile awhile longer."
3,for fans only,"I enjoyed Audioslave's first disc, unfortunately, after listening to this album a dozen times, my love for it has turned into a slight disappointment. While there are a few songs that I like, the album as a whole lacked the consistency of their first effort, and I frankly find a couple of the songs to be terrible. The highlights are ""You're time has come,"" ""Out of Exile,"" ""Be Yourself"" and ""The Worm.""The other album I picked up at the same time was Deep Purple's ""Rapture of the Deep."" This album gets better and better and better. Five stars for sure. Bravo DP!Out of Exile = 3 starsRapture of the Deep = 5 stars"
4,Pretty Chill Album!,"I don't like to compare bands' new albums to their old albums. This album doesn't disapoint at all. In fact, I believe the band has refined and perfected it's sound. Proved to be good background music for my Memorial Day barbeque. This album shows how much Tom Morello has grown as a musician over the past 15 years...he is truly incredible on this album."
4,Great follow-up album,"I'm giving this album 4 stars only in comparison to their first. Otherwise it would get a 5. Once again, Audioslave has put together an album that is great from the first to last track. You can just put the CD in and listen all the way through (unlike most CD's). But, I'm not sure I'll listen to this one 5000 times, like I did with their first CD."
4,Close to perfect,"This album is just about as close to perfect as you can get, you can tell it has been influenced by some more, how should i put it, mellow music. However, that is not a bad thing. I have listened to the cd once through already, but its one of those that will take a few weeks to love, so dont rely on your first impression.I would say my only disappointment is it doesn't have the same mood as their first cd, and seems to be targeted at a larger audience.Overall though, it is very good."
4,Up and Down But Overall Good,"I am a big Soundgarden fan, and I really loved the first Audioslave album. Regarding this one, there are some good joints on it, but I just can't get over how the first song ""Your Time Has Come"" has almost exactly the same riff as the first song on the last album--""Cohise"". Did they think no one would notice? I think it's pretty lame. The song Your Time Has Come is pretty strong on its own though, and the only real clinker is ""Heaven's Dead"" which sounds like one of the many forgetable songs from Temple of the Dog. Be Yourself is weak too and doesn't really fit the rest of the album, which has a lot of Soundgarden-like rockers. The Worm and Man or Animal are straight up classic Soundgarden joint. #1 Zero is kind of power-ballady (slow part, heavy part, repeat). Drown Me Slowly is a little more Ragey. A solid album once you get over their copying of the Coshise riff, and the couple weak songs."
3,Just can't beat them good 'ole days!,"After hearing Audioslave's first album, and knowing where the roots of each band member had originated, I can say that the band has made a fair evolution with the new album. However, I don't think its fair to say that the album is better than the first, at all. It does have some good riffs, and the lyrics are still just as profound, but their sound seems to have become more ""radio proud,"" if you will. In truth, if you really like the band (or even the songs they play on the radio from ""Out of Exile"") I would go ahead and buy the album, but I wouldn't expect the greatness that the first album produced. I guess one could say that it just wasn't as ""fresh""."
5,Give it a chance to grow on you,"I'll be honest - When I first heard this album, I was DISAPPOINTED! I wanted something much heavier and more like RAGE. I almost gave it away to a buddy of mine all the while cursing Cornell on how he could make an album like this!Then I listened to it much later and fell in love with ""The Worm"" Gave it more of a chance and now I LOVE IT! ""#1 Zero"" is by far my favorite track - it just kicks you in the ass. ""Dandelion"" and ""The Worm"" round out my top 3.So those of you who may hate this CD, chill, listen to it later, and you may just be surprised...."
4,Pisser the Misser- You missed it entirely.,"Pisser the Misser-You missed it entirely. First of all what do you mean by, oh I believe the term you used was pu**ified. What do you mean! Listen I will not deny that RATM's message was as powerful as the music, but cut these guys some slack for Chr**sakes! People eventually grow up and become more discerning as their tastes become more focused and defined. When it comes to comparing A*S to RATMFM. It's apples and oranges. However if you really want to get right down to it and try to compare both bands formulaically- A*S= a fine 12year old scotch/// RATMFM= a good thick lager] Conclusion: both are fine and may be enjoyed, however the older more experienced 12 year old scotch will always kick the a** off a good lager any day when it comes to sheer fire power!"
4,Out of Exile as a new band,"Love them or hate them, this album sounds like they are finally a cohesive unit other than a supergroup. I could go on forever and dissect each song but i wont. Although, ""Be Yourself"" could have been one of the greater modern rock radio tunes of all time if they had worked out a stronger chorus. It ends up just being a very mediocre typical lead single. Its definitely a good album for people like me who wish the music scene today was as good as it was in the 90sOther highlights: Your Time Will Come, Doesn't Remind Me, Out of Exile, Drown Me Slowly, Man or Animal."
2,uugghh!,"I think I've listened to this once....that's all I could take. ""Be Yourself"" is the only decent one here. Anybody want my copy? It's in the bottom of the Mississippi River somewhere near Memphis. Good luck!"
3,Solid but recycled.,"I have been a very big fan of this band, and have seen every show including Lollapalooza, where they stole the show. Out of Exile is a very solid album, however Cornell allows Morello to directly rip off Soundgarden on Your time has come. Check out the song ""Get on the Snake"" by Soundgarden, it's EXACTLY the same riff!"
2,"OK EVERYONE, STOP THE B.S., & LETS SPEAK THE TRUTH","We all love Chris Cornell & the guys in RATMBut cut the B.S. people, & be honest with each other & yourselves...Audioslaves first album was awesome, & there needs to be more bands like this one...but,'Out of Exile' sounds exactly like their first album - You wont feel any new emotions from songs off this album you didnt feel off their last... even musically, its practically the exact same album - the similarities in style with songs such as 'Your Time Has Come' in comparison to 'Cochise' are too apparent for you to lie to yourself about.0 experimentation, & 0 evolutionSomeone has to say it...THE GOOD NEWS: You don't have to buy, or burn a copy of 'Out of Exile' to own it... all you have to do, is own Audioslave's first album."
1,Reminds me,"I dont like listening to to Chris Cornell sing on Out of Exile because it reminds me of Soundgarden. I dont like listening to Tom Morello play guitar on Out of Exile because it reminds me of Rage Against the Machine. I dont like Chris Cornell telling me he likes breaking guitars because it doenst remind him of anything because its BS just like this band, as though he's never seen The Who. The whole damn thing reminds me of how gutless musicians are, to make bland, predictable pointless music thats totally similar to what they've already done over and over for ten years. Audioslave doesnt remind me of anything creative or original."
2,Save your money,"I've been listening to this cd on repeat most of the day, in hopes it would be one of those classics that grows on you. It's not.I won't get overly detailed on the individual tracks. It has a couple (maybe 4, or 5 if you want to stretch it) of good songs with some catchy riffing, and the occasional mind-skewering Morello solo, but it's a bit weak overall.The new single ""Be Yourself"" is terrible. Don't even compare it to ""I am the Highway.""Don't expect the same semi-Rage stylings from their debut cd. I don't know if Cornell was very involved in the music writing, but if I had to guess, he wasn't. This cd just does not live up to any of my expectations, so save your money."
3,"Good, but a disappointment","Tom Morello is a terrific guitarist. In fits and spurts he can create terrific riffs and solos. However, he is inconsistent. He often seems too obsessed with his own creativity and forgets about the depth of the music he is playing. This CD is a perfect example of his inconsistency, and, as others have said, all of his noodling eventually gets a little boring. Audioslave has more potential than this. They have a terrific rythm section, a great vocalist and good lyricist, and a talented guitarist. The solution: Mr. Morello needs to be reined in a little bit, and Mr. Cornell needs to be given a little more freedom. Adding a few guitar licks from Mr. Cornell would do wonders for the depth of Audioslave's music. Unless and until that happens, they will have CDs like this - good, but all too familiar."
2,they BLOW it,"i still CRANK all of soundgarden and rage's music -- i read somewhere that morella says he didn't come to the show with big riffs -- damn shame -- 'cause it shows. as for cornell, though a good voice, he wants to be in the same league as mariah carey -- damn shame. as for the lyrics -- same old same old -- he needs some new metaphors -- perhaps a few literature courses or the ""poetic principle"" -- all in all, damn shame.they need to 'feel' the rage again and live like animals.....they're gone...:("
2,Disappointing....,"I was expecting more from Chris Cornell, especially since I was a big fan of Soundgarden. I have listened to this disc several times, and all the songs just seem to blend together, nothing really sticks out except for the single that's playing on the radio right now. I need more than one good track to recommend this to others, and I'm not hearing anything else worth buying on this disc..."
4,Audioslave Lose Their Edge,"This is not a case of sophomore jinx. It is a progression that sees Audioslave soften up, slow down and... frankly, get a little boring. The rolling tunes are still there, but mellowed. Chris Cornell is still his brooding self but he is left to drone on too long on many tracks. Somebody needs to tell him he doesn't need to be singing the whole length of every song. In fact, the best song on the album (Be Yourself) is only outstanding because the music is allowed to stand by itself. This band has potential which has only partly been unfolded, and this album seems like a step in the wrong direction.Audioslave has yet to truly open up."
4,"Solid Rock that goes places. Nowadays, that's a lot to say.","I highly recommend this piece of rock to everybody who's a bit hopeless and tired of the degrading state of radio today. A truly enjoyable record that grows on you. First and foremost: it rocks. Period. Put the volume way up and shake your head to the riffs of the two opening tracks. You'll feel your blood pumping with the raw violence of Tom's simple and tasty guitar play, the amazing voice of Chris, those drums that never quit. Different tracks take you to different places, all of them relevant and credible. It feels refreshing and weird at the same time to hear a band that doesn't treat you like you are some stupid kid who enjoys catchy rythms and flashy choruses. Together with their amazing debut album, they make a great hard rock collection."
4,Still the start,"Audioslave is still at the start of what's to come. althought, these guys came off as a solid super group with not much inspiration to me with their first offering. They just didn't seem like a real group. It was kinda hard listening to a band that the band members don't even seem like they would be drinking buddies even with their tremendous talent. But it was good enough to keep me interested in this album so i bought it. And in my opion they are probably one of only a few solid rock bands out there. They definitly seemed to have come together as a tighter group, it shows on whole album. And we need more bands like this that mtv and the radio doesn't shove down our throats too much. There's no need to mention their past accomplishments they have proven they can rock and are among the greatest of our time. Check it out."
2,Very Disappointing,I loved their first album and expected great things from them. This album seems rushed. Not even guitarist Tom Morello can save this album. Save your money.
3,Decent,"This is an ok cd. It is well procuced and everything works. Tom Morello really sounds good on this album and Chris Cornell sings pretty well. Now why i gave this 3 stars; its good for what it is. I really have trouble listening to audioslave because RATM is one of my top bands. I know you are going to say get over it and i have but, Its hard to hear tom shredding these songs without Zack De LA Rocha, Brad Wilk, and Y. tim K. But i do like this cd and you should get it. But their debut is better, and RATM is 100000000 times better."
1,Annoying!,"This band is just annoying.Chris Cornell is more memorable for his styled moustache than the music on this album, their first was'nt half bad in fact quite good. But it should of been a one off collaberation.All these songs are based around the lyrics and not the music, thats where the problem lies in todays music scene currently."
1,man.. B O R I N G,"what the?? sounds like the old bandmembers from one of the rocking""ist"" groups ever, are on a severe dose of nytol! too bad, we all know how this story goes.. i did really like their first album though."
4,"First album, 5 stars. This one, 4 stars.","I'm not sure how to get this across. I love Audioslave. I love Soundgarden and RATM. This album is terrific...but not quite as explosive as the first one. The first album gets you off your feet with your hands pumping in the air...this one makes you sit down. Not in a bad way, but this is not fist pounding. And don't take that as something negative because I do like it...it's just different. Some reviewers hypothisized that the first album was RATM being RATM and Chris Cornell being Soundgarden, but I disagree with that. It's kind of like the difference between Led Zeppelin 2 and Led Zeppelin 3. Ah. I wonder how many of you will understand that?Overall, it's a great rock album. I mean, what else are you going to buy, Sum 41?while you're at it, check out a band called CKY...especially if you thought this was a bit too mellow."
2,What happened to Audioslave?,"I will probably still buy the next Audioslave CD, if there is one, in hopes that the third disc will match the hard hitting R&R of the first one. That said, 'Out of Exile' was a disappointment. While the first album was one of the best sets released in the last 20 years - the second was a pale imitation of 'pop' music. What happened?"
2,Send this Album into Exile,"Since I heard that Audioslave was coming out with a new album considering how excellent the first one is, but then I heard ""Out of Exile"". For some reason the album lacks something, although the Tim C and Tom Morello are awesome musicians, but they weren't represented well with this album. However, the new Audioslave lacks the soul the original did, it sorta sounds like they went through the motions of playing; Or perhaps it was the more limited involvement that Rick Ruben had in the production of the album. The album is disappointing considering who the band members are, some of the songs are almost unlistenable. Although I still consider the group a super group, in my opinion they just put out a sub-par album. Hopefully, they just fell to the old sophmore jinx as most bands do; guess we'll see with the 3rd album."
4,coming down from exile...,"Well, one won't have to wait any longer for Chris Cornell's wailing, and Tom Morello's great guitar styling's any longer (plus everyone else's great contribution, because it is terrific). Thankfully too, Audioslave proves they can keep on charging. This is especially true with such songs as ""Be Yourself"", but they are not limited there.In fact, since all of the members have such great experience (as we know: Soundgarden for Cornell, and the others Rage Against the Machine), they use it once again to their complete advantage, as they simultaneously tighten up just the overall adhesiveness of the band in general.I still haven't decided whether I like this one better then the other, although thanks to MySpace I've given it plenty of listening, but either way one can appreciate the album when thought of separately from the first. I mean this is no sophomore slump, but of course this might not be a miraculous step-up from their last album either."
5,Jack Kerouac meets Alice in Wonderland,"Funny that I share the same name as this author! Ha!!! This is book two in a strange and fast-paced trilogy. I wish they'd print this in paperback, so it'd reach a wider audience. It kind of feels like Jack Kerouac on acid. Beginning in Seoul, there's a U.S. return, and the whole thing ends in Europe. Pirate smugglers, aliens, Nazi war criminals, nymphet twins, tortured Hollywood stars... it's all here. Great second book!"
5,"A superb over-view of the Atlantis quest, past and present.","This welcome addition to the Atlantis catalogue provides a succinct yet detailed overview of past and current thinking, discoveries, hypotheses and searches for Atlantis. The book is liberally sprinkled with numerous Edgar Cayce quotations which may put off some sceptics but is a delight for the rest of us! I was impressed by the detailed documentation of the different explorations undertaken together with the close examination of available scientific evidence and thinking. A six page bibilography of books and periodicals further attests to the scholarly approach of its authors. Essential reading for those who hear the call."
5,Great read,"A good story from a new SciFi author. A real page turner. I enjoyed the Smith's descriptive narration style. It's very cinematic. Even though this book is about 450 pages, it reads fluently and quickly."
4,Pretty decent shoe,"These run a little small compared to my IPATH Cats, bout half a size smaller. They are stretching out though. Seem to be holding up just fine. I've had them about a month and walk the dogs in them every day. No seam tearing like others have said."
2,No half sizes!??,"I ordered these shoes because I simply liked the way they look. However there are no half sizes... I wear 11 1/2 and I got a 12, they are too big, and I figured the 11 would be too small, so now I wear them with thick socks and its not that bad but if you wera a half size I dont really recomend these make of shoes"
3,Size too small,"I am a size 11R and I ordered the same. I found the shoe to fit like a size 10R. I sent the shoes back and requested a refund. I was worried that if I ordered a size 12, they may get it right and it would fit like a size 12...I didn't want to take a chance and possible waste my time."
3,"Comfy, but they get smelly",Comfy and good fit. I got the khaki mesh and even got a few compliments from people. Only downside is they get pretty stinky...or maybe its just my feet. I used odor eaters and didnt really help much
1,Cheaply made,"Globe shoes wear out too fast, both pairs wore out with the lightest casual use. Please make your shoes better quality!"
3,"great, awesome gun, sadly came cracked",i received this gun in three days. i realized the gun was cracked but it works perfectly fine. its a absolute steel for 35 bucks but it is cracked.i dont want to return it its that good as a secondary weapon. but its CRACKED.
3,Good for target practice...,"This was my very first airsoft gun, that was a long time ago... At first, I thoght this looked great, not so much anymore. It is a good sturdy gun, but it is slow and has a small clip... Here are some pros and cons.Pros:-OK fps (300- 320)-Very accurate-Good for shooting targetsCons:-Samll clip-Sights are horrible-SlowIt is an ok gun, for a begginer."
4,shot gun,"This shotgun is a good one. It goes pretty far and accurate. the only thing is, is that it doesnt hold a lot of ammo. but other than thats it is a very good gun."
2,sucks,this gun sucks balls and is so bad i have had my baby sister shoot it and hit herself and she doesn't fell anything. it would be better tohit somone over the head with this gun and see wtat they would do insted of shooting thema nd having them stand therte blinking and shooting u
2,Didn't Work,"I bought this product hoping it would slick and hold down my natural african-american (4ab) hair edges. It required alot and it didn't work. Seems like there is too much oil in the product. I was expecting a very hard wax substance. Also the smell is very overwhelming. If you have allergies or if you are sensitive to odors, don't buy it."
5,"No Fuss, No Mess","Very easy to use, just push up the stick and rub it on your hair. It works great and you don't end up with messy hands. I love it!"
1,What is this stuff??,Never quite figured out how to use this product. Leaves clumps in my medium length hair. Would not purchase again.
1,"Beautiful bowl, dreadful shipping","This is a lovely bowl, or it would have been if it hadn't arrived in 4 large pieces. It arrived in a timely way, but it was packed so badly that it was almost inevitable that it would break in transit. The bowl itself was in a flimsy cardboard carton with no bubble wrap or peanuts. This carton was wedged firmly into the bottom of another carton and packing was then jammed on top, so the bowl itself rocked around with very little padding on the bottom. I was so disappointed, I sent it back immediately. I have yet to receive a refund, but it's been the holidays."
1,Great movie.. Careful who you buy it from.,Disc was scratched. Can't even play. Super waist of time and money. Movie is great but ... Can't watch it. So pissed.
4,"Overall, a good story.","I was really tentative about this movie at first. Did I really want to relive the big-hair 80s metal band era? Oh, why not. Its harmless fun. So I did. And I enjoyed it.Rock Star works because it doesn't take itself too seriously, even if Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) does. Through a strange twist of events, Cole becomes the lead singer of his favorite metal band, Steel Dragon. He fits right in because its a role he's practiced all to well fronting the Steel Dragon tribute band, Blood Pollution.There are all sorts of sub-plots that meander here and there, none of which add much to the film, but they don't seem to detract from it either. I think the thing that makes this film work for me is the chance to live vicariously through Cole. No matter what decade you grew up in, if you liked music, you wanted to be the lead singer of your favorite rock band. This movie lets you watch a kid who got to live that dream, and it was fun to watch."
5,Answer to the song Kid Review is looking for,The song he sings is Colorful by The Verve Pipe....have to agree a great song!
1,Hair band Artist = a Dud,Mark Wahlberg very seldom gets it right on the Big Screen.I thought He was alright in Boogie Nights but this is a Major Step down.Jennifer Aniston needs to stick to TV because She can't act worth a tick tac for my moneys worth.this film might have been ok back in the 80's but I doubt it.this is one of those films that if you are having a sleepless night it is a solid cure.
1,"NEED PIRATE VERSION RECUT WITH ""GLITTER""","Mariah Carey's much maligned ""GLITTER"" and Mark Whalberg 's ""ROCK STAR"" are insulting films but the stars are actually OK in thankless roles. What I am secretly hoping for is that someone with a hi-end Mac with DVD-write and copy encryption bypass will edit these two films into one coherent whole that intercuts the lives of these two self-centered, sappy, desperate-for-fame characters into one blazing farce about lost opportunities and big lungs. What a great bootleg enterprise for some audacious digital pirate."
2,Not Really That Good,There's really no point in seeing this movie if you have seen an episode of Behind the Music/Where Are They Now?. If only VH1 would play those shows again instead of the crap they play now . . . anyway it's not really that good.
4,AC/DC OUTRAGE!!,"As a die-hard AC/DC fan..I was rather stunned by the use of ""Are You Ready"" during the first few scenes. The tour jackets had the year 1985 on them, which may or may not have been the same year as the piercing scene. Giving the benefit of the doubt, the song wouldn't have been released for ANOTHER 5 YEARS!!!! The rest of the movie was pretty good, except for the ending. You don't just walk off stage. There are contracts and whatnot. Watch the movie once, if you're into the 80's hari bands, buy it.... but it's a bit of a stretch to reality."
4,What do people want from movies???,"I don't get it. The criticism of this movie baffles me. A metal movie about ""a wannabe who got to be"" could have very easily fallen into an excuse to display throngs of scantily-clad women. Instead, it successfully takes a normal kid with some talent and leads you through his experience. That it's not ""Citizen Kane"" is not the point, and a ridiculous expectation. Are moments formulaic? Of course. Does it still work? YES!!! Loved the music. Loved the serious treatment of the genre. Loved the potrayal of the rockers as real people who get caught up in the ready temptations of the ""Rock Star"" life. Loved ""ROCK STAR""."
4,This movie rocks!,"My husband and I saw a preview of this movie about a month ago and loved every moment of it. It was a lot of fun. Mark Wahlberg has succeeded, at least for me, in totally proving he has what it takes to carry a movie. I would have given this 5 stars, but I felt that Jennifer Aniston's character wasn't as fully realized as it could have been, although she did a great job. The songs were great! I had different tunes from the movie running through my head for a week. The supporting cast was excellent. Run, don't walk to the theatres next week when this movie opens and be prepared for a good time!"
2,"Promising premise,but...","When I first saw the trailers I thought it looked kinda fun(Heck,I was into the hard rock/hair metal thing for a time in the 80s),but then I saw the movie and that hope was dashed.A promising premise is undermined by a shoddy script and saccharine sentimentality.Is this a CBS sunday night movie?How this flick ended made me smirk,thinking of how so many metalheads morphed into the grunge scene.Barf!"
3,Good movie that wraps up too quickly,"Marky Mark plays a smarter Dirk Diggler in Rock Star. He does shine in this movie as the young kid who gets to play out his wildest fantasy - being the frontman of his fave band.Art imitates life in this film as the same thing happened to one lucky soul who worshipped Judas Priest...By the time we see Wahlberg in full rock star glory, the movie is already starting to unravel. Not enough attention is paid to his life as the rock star which would have been very interesting. The end is pretty anticlimactic but overall this film is entertaining.I'm not sure Jennifer Aniston belonged in this movie. It just seemed like a lesser star could have pulled it off better. It just felt like Aniston has trouble not being ""Rachel"" in this movie."
4,:0) enjoyable,Love it true to the roll he did a good job i remember seeing it couple years ago didn't think it would be good but it was when i watched it recently....
4,Mockumentary,"Don't take this movie seriously. Lots of metal rock fans are whinning, as usual,...lol. Although based on one of the front men of Judas Priest, it's not the story so stop your whinning rock fans. Marky Mark did a good job in this film, funny. The director took the time to not only talk to rockers but have them in his movie so much of what we are seeing is pretty typical of the rock lifestyle. The movie is well made, and is fun to watch so enjoy it....and to the rock fans PLS STOP WHINNING."
2,Approach with caution,"Surprisingly, this is a topic not covered much by moviemakers before. Shame, then, that Rock Star, is such a dud. Nothing wrong with Mark Wahlberg’s acting or the talented but hopelessly miscast Jennifer Anniston. The problem lies with the cheesy, cynical, unconvincing way the hard rock genre is portrayed. The conflict situations are ridiculously hammy (the rival bands face-off in the car park is particularly cringeworthy). All the way through the movie I got the uncomfortable feeling I was watching a film intended for 7 year-olds. Lovers of rock movies be warned. The only redeeming feature is Timothy Spall as charismatic road manager, the rest of the cast make very unconvincing rock stars and very unconvincing actors. If you haven't seen Almost Famous famous, I would recommend that movie instead.."
2,Minor League,"It would have gotten a 3 except for the ending. Making a reference to grunge being more ""real"" ruined it for me. Jennifer Aniston's character has no life to it at all. The movie started out good, but became cliche very quickly. The guest stars were better then the main characters. Mark Wahlberg was pretty weak as well."
4,Rock Star really does ROCK,"I loved this movie!!! I thought it showed how you can be a rock star if you believe in yourself. Jennifer Aniston really played a good part as his girlfriend/ manager. I first saw this movie on VHS ""Movies That Rock"" and I just went out and bought the DVD."
4,Critics aren't always right,"This movie got terrible reviews, I presume by people who were expecting another ""Spinal Tap"", or at the very least,something as gimmicky as ""Almost Famous"". It's not like either of those, in fact, it's most like ""Boogie Nights,"" and not just because of Mark Wahlberg. It's actually pretty good, about a guy who gets to live his dream of being the singer for his favorite band, and then finds out that they are just as warty and uncool as the rest of us, at least some of the time. I suppose that the perpetually hip won't like the ending, but the decisions made by Wahlberg's sweet character ring true for the way he plays the guy throughout the film. (OK the wig is dreadful, but oh well)."
3,Good music but story had holes,"I grew up in the 80's and loved the music. I thought Mark Wahlberg did a good job and the plot had promise. There should have been more about his relationship with his Steel Dragon bandmates other than with his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Aniston. I didn't even see the point of her presence in the movie. She basically played Rachel with an 80's hairdo, uttering bored and sarcastic lines, and wasn't quite skanky enough to play an 80's metal groupie. Watch it for the tunes, or better yet, just buy the soundtrack and/or skip to the audition and concert scenes on the DVD chapter selection."
5,Rock star-A look into the wild side.,"This movie is great because it shows you exactly what goes on behind the scenes. Wahlbergh plays the once no-name singer to a well known metal star. Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend/manager who eventually gets pushed in the backround of this Metal world. Being based on Judas Preists story of Fan turned Metal singer I think it is a very good movie.It is possible! Dreams do come true!! I would recommend this movie also because of the made up band with Jason Bonham in it,Zak wyle, and because it is a glimpse of that world."
4,I was glad it was just a movie and not my life...,"This movie was kind of hard to watch in places. A rock musician discovers fame overnight, and we witness his descent into a life of overindulgence and no morals.He loses sight of what's important in the pursuit of the rock star's lifestyle. He actually loses a lot more than that.Wahlberg was amazingly convincing. I had a hard time believing it was him throughout the film. Aniston was also great in her role - complex but not overdramatic. Just simply complex - holding on to her own values in the end, she sets a really great example.I have to say the last few minutes made the whole movie worth watching - it was like getting a tooth ache and finally having the thing extracted. The end made up for all the agony in the middle of the movie.If you like rock and roll, and you like to see good guys win in the end (even if the enemies are their own stupidities), then watch this one, but not with the kids!"
4,Entertaining,Great movie for anyone who grew up with the music from the time period. Nostalgic. Brings back memories of youth.
4,Fun movie,"Although it attempts to be overly dramatc at times, it is a fun movie with excellent music. Mark Wahlberg's lip synching is spot on."
2,disappointed in oregon,"When I first saw the previews for this DVD and the cast that included Jennifer Aniston and Mark Wahlberg I couldn't wait to see it but when I did finally get to watch it I cant even tell you what a disappointment it was. For starters it was a very slow paced film, the plot was not planned out very well, but the main thing that really was depressing was the fact that it had two real great actors for such a rotten film"
2,A dissatisfying film,"I find Rock Star to be disappointing. It centers around the '80s hard rock music scene. Chris Cole--played by Mark Wahlberg--has a day job that consists of fixing photocopiers. At night, he is a vocalist for a tribute band, Blood Pollution, that performs songs by the popular group Steel Dragon. Subsequently, he is contacted by Steel Dragon, does the audition, and becomes their new singer. The first hour of Rock Star shows promise but becomes tedious afterwards. The flaws are a thin plot and cardboard cutout characters. While the acting from the cast is not bad, the problem lies with their characters not being fleshed out enough. The facets I like are the music, cinematography, and concert scenes. Even though Rock Star sports good aspects, it is not a solid movie. Rock Star is 106 minutes. I actually give it 2.5 stars."
3,Good but cheesy movie,"Although 80's heavy metal was certainly at times over the top, I don't think it was as bad as the movie tried to show.I like Mark Wahlberg, and after the abysmal Planet of the Apes, I was hoping that he would get a more interesting role, which in this film, he plays very well. Unfortunately, Anniston is simply there to fill film space as his girlfiend.The other annoying part of this film is the end, where they insinuate that the fledgling grunge and alternative movement was more 'real'.Despite its many flaws, this is still a fun movie for anight out, but nothing more."
1,Stupidest Movie I've Ever Seen,This was the most trite piece of garbage that I have ever watched. I thought it made fun of Heavy Metal much more than it glamorized it. Stupid and embarrassing from beginning to end.Mark Walburg is so lame!
1,Oh boy....,"Well, did you notice the hair of Steel Dragon's ""leader""? What a joke!! In this movie, it's clear the director, the producers, the actors, everybody involved didn't give a damn about rock and roll or heavy metal. Mark Walhberg is as bad as ever. If the movie was intended to be a parody or comedy, it could have been tolerated. But it is not! It was meant to be ""serious"", há!, with all that cliches, songs from other bands being credited to Steel Dragon, even Zakk Wylde's participation is terribly dumb...The movie is so shallow it made me puke. A terrible damage to the already shaken metal credibility in the States..."
1,Out of words to say how bad this is.....,"For those of us who really like rock and heavy metal (the kind og guy who buys hundreds of CD's, that knows a about a band history, a band line-up, that know the songs for their names, etc), this movie is sacrilege. It's utterly bad. It has produced damage to the already prejudiced image of rock. Wahlberg's acting is lame; the options for the soundtrack is absurd: the so-called band STEEL DRAGON is supposedly a killer band, witht hei own great original material. But the songs that STEEL DRAGON play in the movie, as if it was of their authory, are not!! It has one song from RAINBOW, another from DEF LEPPARD, it's absurd!Even as joke it did not work, because it was not conceived as a joke!"
3,Not a bad way to kill a couple of hours.,"This is certainly not one of Wahlberg's best flicks, but you can't help but like the movie. Most of this is due to Wahlberg really getting into the role. Jennifer Anniston is mediocre as usual. All in all, just a fun movie to watch."
5,Great Service!,DVD arrived nicely packaged and well before delivery date. Will definitely use this seller in the future. Thank you!
4,"""Rock Star"" just plain rocks","I just saw the film ""Rock Star"" today with my best friend and I liked it a lot. It is a really entertaining film that is both really funny and dramatic. I thought Mark Wahlberg did some of his best work here. After making the dull film ""Planet of the Apes"", it was nice to see him really doing some great acting and really use his skills to make a film that doesn't leave you disappointed and will put a smile on your face and make you feel good. I thought Jennifer Aniston did a good job too. She pulls her role off really well as Wahlberg's girlfriend/manager and she looks great in this film, as usual. Also, I thought the film had a good story to it and it wasn't just thrown together with a lot of heavy metal in between a bunch of dialogue. It really has a point. Even though ""Rock Star"" may not be a totally original film, it still is great entertainment. So in conclusion, go see this film because it really is a good one."
3,I didn't think I would like this movie,"I thought it would be sappy and melodramatic, but it's actually funny and *shock* intelligent. It's Spinal Tap: Vol 2. Give this one a try if you like to make fun of '80s rock stars."
1,"Oh, boy.....","I can't believe some of the generous reviews below towards this movie... After watching it, it became completely clear to me why Judas Priest did not want to get its name associated with this thing...The movie is a parody, but abad one. Let's see why:1) WHy on Earth they included RAinbow's LONG LIVE ROCK AND ROLL and Def Leppard's ROCK ROCK as being STEEL DRAGON's originals, if you had the great Trevor Rabin taking care of the music????...2)Why always only the singers in STEEL DRAGON get fed up with the rock and roll lifestyle and the other four member don't?3) Why they chose to portray a POP METAL band, and not a straight ahead metal band like Iron Maiden or Motorhead??Well, enough. AS with racing driver movies, producers just can't get to know how to sht a movie dealing about rock / metal (exception: ALMOST FAMOUS, that simply blows ROCK STAR apart!...)"
3,"kack rock, glam, crap, still a fun movie to watch!","Um..I really HATE new movie's..but ya know this one aint bad!!This has some very unusaul stuff for a movie made these day's as well, dont really know how this got made..but then again it's not like it is ''white power'' or anything, HAHA!!Story is some guy in a ''tribute'' band get's to join the real band whom he ''love's'', his girlfriend is along the ride for this, she become's sick of the decadent life style, leave's, the male does get sick as well and leave's ,they then get back together..etc not to bad!!Really worth seeing, but SPINAL TAP is a million time's better..not even a comparison for these two movie's!!WATCH SPINAL TAP INSTEAD!!!"
4,Could have been a classic,"Great premise for a movie. And it WAS a pretty good movie...but with the right director this could have been a classic. He seems to rush through it and leave alot of holes in the movie. Some music he plays is wrong for that era, and he decides to play INXS and Talking Heads at pivital points in the movie when this movie is about HEAVY METAL...The STEEL DRAGONS songs are AWESOME!!! They sound just like they came out of the 80's...Just thought some would be interested in knowing this...The musicians of Steel Dragon are the same that play in the movie...Zakk Wylde on guitar, Jason Bohnam on drums, the guy from Dokken (forgot his name) on bass, but singing the songs is the lead vocalist from the group Steelheart, who had a hit in the 80's with the song ""Never Let You Go""...it is not Mark Walberg singing. In the directors commentary, he dosent even know who is singing...what a LOOSER!!!"
1,Angry Inch,"pathetic movie.When will Hollywood get that Mark Whalberg CANNOT carry a movie, especially when the script is bad."
3,AWESOME 80'S MOVIE TRIBUTE!! but kind of touching!!!!,"I though that this movie would be cool as Detroit Rock City or Dazed and Confused but is not! Rock Star is not exacly a ""rock movie tribute for the past deacades"" like Detroit Rock City, this is more like a dramatic story of a rocker fan in the 80's.But DON'T GET ME WRONG! this movie is COOL!! The main character in the story hang out with the band, gettin wasted, going with groupies, lisening to rock, flashing devil horn signs and teaching his little bother how to be a HEAVY METAL FAN!The Cons are: Most of the soundtracks were not taken from true 80's rock bands, they were made by this fictional band with fictional songs called Dragon Steel. The movie have some touching moments that spoil the fun, there were no comments about 80's rock bands, the movie wasn't that funny and the ending was kind of predictable.P.S: Is worth buying it, but if you are looking for cool funny rocking movies of past decades then this is not for you.ADIOS."
1,OOPS I DID IT AGAIN,Yes bought a really bad movie. Yes it's that bad. Don't even waste your time or money. Would't even watch it again if it came on HBO. I would of gave it no stars but it wouldn't let me.
1,RIDICULOUS..,"To say that this movie is so ""eighties"" must be a joke. THis movie is total damage to hard rock music. If you wanna see a great and honest movie about hard rock, check ALMOST FAMOUS.THis movie is a bomb, not surprisingly at all. No wonder JUdas Priest did not want their name included in this project!! It's horrible!"
3,Money worth,"I was looking for a cheap quick alternative to brades, this seems to meet my expectation. For around 30 bucks, you really can go wrong. Time saving, priceless. I usually finish my shaving with brades in about 10 to 15 minutes, now it's 10 seconds."
1,"Cheap, Noisy, and Horrible.","I was given this razor by a friend. Nice gesture, but I gave him his money back. This razor did not shave close at all. Even after going over the area numerous times(This is even using lectric shave). Especiially bad in the chin-neck area. After a month of using this razor the foil desintergrated during my shave and gave a nasty cut on my cheek. after this I will never use another braun. My friend al had a top of the line 360 complete that did the same thing. My recommendation is to stick to norelco. All of their models shave as close as blade and are much more durable."
1,Don't know why people buy this.,"Well, I'll start off by saying that this was my first electric shaver, so bear with me.After charging the thing for four hours, as the instructions say, I turn it on. Immediately you notice that it's pretty noisy, so I was a little surprised. I start shaving, and once I'm done, I notice that it missed a bunch of hairs even after going over spots more than three or four times. My face also got pretty dry afterward, and a few spots I was bleeding quite a bit.My face never got this bad with a simple razor, and never was my face burning so much after using aftershave because of this. I've already got it packed and ready to be returned. Waste of money and a waste of time."
2,Not worth $50,"I bought this shaver just for travel trips, based on Consumer Reports review. Not worth the $50, maybe $20. It is loud, does a poor job of shaving, takes forever to get the job done and whatever you do don't try shaving a 2 day old beard. Like pulling each hair out one-by-one with tweezers, OUCH!! I have a 7000 series Syncro at home that is unbelievably smooth, normally $100 but it was $80 in the clearance bin at Walmart. Worth every penny."
2,not very convenient,"When I shave, I need to go to a sink, because a lot of the debris of beard will come out. It is really a mess."
4,Good staff,"After one charge, it can last for hours. I have a Phillips shavor with batteries, but I prefer this one that I don't need to take batteries out and wait for ten hours. I like it."
4,"Affordable, effective electric shaver","Close shave. Easy to use and clean. Handle provides good grip. Sideburn trimmer is powerful, wide, and accurate. Previous experience with Braun has shown that the least durable shaver component is the foil. It will be interesting to see how long this one lasts."
1,great product BUT,"I think it's outrageous the way Amazon has raised the price of this product.On February the cost of this razor was $18,95On October the cost of this razor is $57.25WTF !!!!!!!!!!!!This is three times the original price. WTF !!!!!!!!!!!!THREE TIMES BOY !"
1,Razor that doesn't raze,This razor is meant for pre-teenage beards that pretend to need a daily shave. It simply doesn't work for a heavy beard or a three day growth. A total waste of time.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased it to shave my head and beard. It did not shave close enough, and was very loud."
5,Braun washable 1775 is a great shaver,I bought this shaver seven years ago and it performs as when first bought. I am placing today an order for a friend of mine.
2,A dissappointment,This was my first time owning an electric razor. I sport a beard and only shave my neck and cheek areas a couple of times a week. That's why I wear the beard. I don't like to be bothered shaving. I found that this product worked ok for daily use although a razor is quicker. After a couple of days growth this razor was totally ineffective. If the stubble has any length at all it does not enter holes in the screen. So It is a disappointment for my purposes.
2,Not the best,"I bought this razor to replace my old Norelco since it was about the same price as buying new heads. I was very disappointed in it.I do not have a heavy beard, it grows fast, but I am not one of those that get the five o'clock shadow so it shouldn't have been a tough job for this razor.After charging it up as the directions said I tried it out. First I noticed how loud it was, it sounded as it it was falling apart and made so much noise that I couldn't even hear my radio. I have to say where it did cut was very close, but after closer review, I found a lot of places it had missed so I tried again and still it missed those hairs. I waited a day or two and tried again with the same results. I returned the razor and used the money to buy new heads for my Norelco which worked a lot better.I also wasn't trilled with how to clean it either compared to my old razor.I would recommend to try something else maybe spend a bit more for a better one, but keep away from this one."
3,Decent shave for the price. Needs patience.,"After 4 shaves now, I'm pretty happy overall with this shaver. So far, I wouldn't say that it shaves as close as the Gilette blades that I've been using (Mach4, I think?), but it does a pretty good job. I also noticed that it does take a lot longer than I would like to shave my face with this. You really need to go over the same area many times to get all the hairs. In particular, my neck seems to be a challenge since the hairs grow in all different directions. Right now, it seems to take me about 10-15 minutes with this, when I was able to finish up a close shave with blades in less than 5 previously. Maybe all of this will get better as my face/hair gets used to the shaver. I definitely like the idea of having something that doesn't get thrown out and that I don't have to keep buying replacement blades for. I do hope that this lasts a few years to make it worthwhile."
3,Braun 1775,"This is a mediocre product. I have been using it for almost three months and I still miss my Panasonic ES742. Maybe because it was double-headed? This Braun 1775 is single headed, there is no warning light when the battery runs out. The only good things is that you can finish your shave with the shaver plugged into the outlet. I paid around $40 for it, but I would not buy this shaver again."
4,Great shaver for the price,"Great shaver at a resonable price. If you need an electric shaver this is one to seriously consider. I looked at reviewes before I bought it and I'm glad I did. I don't know what shavers 10 times the price will do, but this is a definite winner."
4,Good,"I bought this item because it's washable, but what I liked most was the battery. Charged once (for 30 minutes or 1 hour), it lasts for a pretty long period (maybe for a month, depending on how frequently you use it). What I don't really care for is the trimmer, but it functions okay."
1,Not up to the online comments.,"I bought this shaver after a broad review of online comments about similar products. I guess that's why the market is so broad. For me, this product just didn't work well. Unfortunately, you can't return something like this, so it's just in a drawer. I then bought a Norelco rechargeable, which works many times better. For me, only shaving every few days, with mostly light stubble, the Braun was hopelessly inept. It took repeated re-do's of the same part of my face. A few days later, the same shave with the Norelco was quick and very effective. I pass on the Braun. Perhaps your mileage might vary."
2,Quite small and weaker than expected,"After the reviews here, and consumer reports, I was expecting a great shaver.Unfortunately it is a disappointment compared to the Braun 5614 I currently use.Quite small, charge does not hold very long, and the angles you are required to use on your face, all are issues that one should be aware of."
3,Not a Close Shave.,"This shaver is rated as a best buy by consumer report. However I am not impressed by its performance. I am switching from the Mach 3 to this shaver so that I can shave everyday. As most of you know, the mach 3 is a very close shave. When you run your hand over your skin, there is almost no prickly spots. With this Braun Shaver, your face is still a little pricklely. Also the Braun shaver leaves some stray hairs. I have to use my Mach 3 to get rid of the stray hairs."
2,Compact but a poor performer,"After owning this razor for about a year, I find the cutting speed is too slow. If you plan to use this razor for travel, then there may be some benefits. However, if you only use it at home, I would look elsewhere."
4,Good shave for the price,I bought this when my more expensive braun shaver began to have to have the head changed too often. This one shaves just as fast and close.
3,Just OK,For the price you can't go wrong. Doesn't shave nearly as close as the Mach 3 I normally use. Good for an occasional quick shave.
2,Electric Shavers Just Don't Work for Me,"This is the second electric shaver I've tried. It failed to get the hairs on my neck and beneath my chin. It did manage to turn my neck red and burny. The hair it could trim was short enough, but missing hairs just doesn't make for a good shave. The razor is also quite loud.I've since moved on to a double edged safety razor from Merkur with real shaving cream and a shaving brush. After two months of practice I now have painless shaves that are irritation free. If you have coarse hair and sensitive skin, don't waste your time with an electric. Nothing will beat a good razor and shaving cream."
1,A real piece of crap!,"Are we talking about the same shaver here? The long and short of it is that it simply does NOT shave. I'm not talking about closeness (i.e. it shaves but not closely). I'm talking about 1/4"" whiskers all over the face.I returned the item and I'm astonished that Braun markets this totally inadequate product.Braun 1775 FreeControl Rechargeable, Washable Men's Shaver"
2,Disappointment.,"Except for the very reasonable price, this shaver is a disappointment and already gathering dust. Yes, it shaves fairly close, but no closer than a $35 Norelco I bought a few years back. My main complaints are the vibration in my hand and its irritating, semi-grinding noise. Braun makes some great appliances, but this is not one of them."
3,Good for the $$$ but not great.,"I have been using electric foil razors for better than 30 years (I like a close shave and I have never found that with ANY rotary shavers). I have owned several Braun and this one compares to the Braun I owned 25 years ago. I bought a cheap Remington at Walmart due to I forgot my good triple foil cutter Braun while on an extended business trip. The Remington had double foil cutter with a center cutter between. I liked it a lot and it was a much faster shave with better results for the same money. Additionally, I have found the Wet/Dry Panasonic way over priced, nosey, and with a middle-of-the-road shave, I will never own another one.The long and short is... my opinion of this shaver is not that of most of the great reviews received on this website and it will be used for travel only.Buy at least a double foil if not a triple foil Remington or Braun and you will be happy. You really don't have to spend but $20.00 more."
4,Pretty Good,This shaver gives you a close shave. The shave is closer than with the two remingtons I owned before. One of the remingtons I returned immediately caues it just doesn't do any shaving. The battery life on this Braun long. What I dont like is that it takes a long time to shave. You gotta shave 2-3 times over the same place in order to end up with a close shave. It has only one blade.
3,braun 1775 shaver,Easy to use and easy to clean. Does not give a close shave even after going over several times. Good shaver for the price but I would buy a better one next time.
2,Defective already after two months,"I was initially pleased with this shaver, which gave decent shaves despite its economical price. After using it for about 2 months, however, I noticed that it was cutting my skin because the guard or grill over the cutters has developed a circular hole about 3/8 inch in diameter. I have used many electric shavers over the past 40 years and nothing like this has ever occurred. For the moment I have a band-aid over the hole so I am still shaving with the unbroken side of the shaver but I find this wholly unsatisfactory.If I had bought this from a local merchant I would have returned it but thisis not convenient or practical for a purchase by mail."
2,It's alright,"As a simple shaver it works OK, but it doesn't get the longer hairs unless you trim them down first, and it doesn't contain the whisker trimmings in the shaver leaving them falling like a light mist. I don't think it shaves as close as my previous shaver, but it's cheap and just an average unit. I will spring for something a little more expensive next time. I find I have to go over the same spot for a while before the job is done."
4,NICE RAZOR FOR THE PRICE ! SAVED $15.00 OFF RETAIL PRICE,I purchased this Razor as a Christmas gift. I have one just like it and it shaves great ! Smooth & close.I saw this very same razor priced $15.00 more at a well known Department Store.
2,"An inefficient, time-consuming shaver","My frustration with this shaver is how long it takes to get the job done. You have to repeatedly go over and over the same skin in order to get all the stubble, whereas an ""old-fashioned"" disposable, multi-blade shaver that is used with shaving cream usually requires only one, maybe two passes.The other limitation of this shaver is that it does poorly with anything other than short stubble. If the hair is an eighth of an inch or longer, you have to cut it down to size with the attached trimmer, then go back to it with the shaver. You have to use the same process with a hair that is lying flat against the neck.In conclusion, I would NOT buy this style of shaver again. My next shaver will be another Norelco with rotary blades."
1,Don't buy it,"I agree with other reviewers who have panned this inferior product. No matter how many times I go over the same area, it invariably misses random hairs. Every time a hair is missed, the probability that it will be missed again rises exponentially. No matter how slowly or long I shave, I end up with 5mm hairs in random places. Since the trimmer has stopped working properly, it is even difficult to use that to chop down the stalks.Unlike other reviewers, I know that Braun can do better. I was used to a Braun 6520 which was an excellent piece of work. But after 5 years of impeccable service, it just stopped working. Since the 6520 is no longer being made, I bought the FreeControl. Big mistake."
3,Good but not great.,"I bought this razor because it's small size and shape looked better for travel than the three-rotor type I've always used -- and because the most credible consumer agency gave it an excellent ratingAfter a couple of months, I'm conceding that it isn't going to mow my face as close as fast as the three-rotary models."
3,Just Like Advertised,"Like other reviewers have stated this is great little shaver for the price and it may have been the cleanest shave I have ever gotten with an electric (I have always had Norelco's in the past), but it is almost useless if your beard is over a day old or for longer neck hair. After each shave I had to clean up areas, mostly around my chin and neck, with my old Norelco which I was hoping to replace. Finally after about 3 weeks I returned it to Amazon for a full refund which went very smoothly and with no long hairs or hard feelings. I think now I will just replace my old Norelco with a new Norelco, as it definitely does a better overall job."
5,Electric shaver,I bought two of the Braun 1775 for my teenage sons who just started shaving. The shavers are perfect for them. Easy to use and little maintainance.
4,Provides a nice shave,I purchased this because it was highly rated in a consumer magazine. It does provide a good shave. Be prepared to spend some time going over areas till you get the results you want. I find my neck is the hardest area to get the closeness I want. Overall a very good product.
4,A pretty great gift for my dad,"I bought this shaver as a gift for my dad, and from what I can tell, he seems pretty happy with it. The shaver is lightweight and a good shape and size, not at all clunky or awkward to hold like some I've seen. It also holds a charge fairly well (for a few days worth of shaving at the least), and is super-simple to clean.As for how well it actually shaves: my dad seems pretty happy and says that, generally, he doesn't have to spend too much time shaving or going over areas twice, and he can get a pretty close shave as well. He does, however, have a tougher time with hard-to-get spots (which I suppose is the not-so-great thing about foil shavers), and his hairs are not generally very stubbly or prickly (which are probably harder to get a good shave for). Overall, he's happy, I'm happy, and at this price, there isn't much to mind."
3,not bad for the price,"Needed to replace my old Braun 105 that finally gave out. Was looking for another corded but seems noone makes them anymore. Anyway, the rechargeable seems to cut OK so far but it doesn't have the power that my old corded one did. We'll see if it holds up as long as my previous one."
3,Meh,"This razor is ok. I bought it to replace an even cheaper pos razor that i bought at Wal-Mart a few years ago. It takes me longer to shave with this razor and it doesn't seem to cut as close. But I barely have any facial hair anyway so perhaps using this razor gives my boyish face a more rugged, manly look."
3,Good Value,The electric razor does a pretty good job but not anything like a blade. It does rather poorly on long hairs.
4,close shave,Light weight for everyday use. Washable screen is convenient to clean. One drawback is that it doesn't come with a case.
5,Good Deal,I bought this shaver not long ago and I really like it. Where can you find a good shaver for this amazing price.
2,Takes to long to shave.,"I like it but I don't have 30 Min to shave every morning, I will stick with the Norelco so I can sleep in the extra minutes it takes to shave with the braun, Oh and if you don't shave for a day forget about trying to shave with the braun, you will need the Norelco first."
4,A great choice for just $35,"The result has been better than what I thought. For the price I never thought that it would work with me. I like the style, size, it charged more faster than my on cellphone."
3,Braun Shaver,Hopefully it will start shaving closer. I do not have a heavy beard and right now it is not doing a very good job of shaing close. I love the size and comfortable feeling in my hand when I am operating it.
1,AVOID this option,"NOISY and vibrates like nothing else...You can hear the shaver in the next room, and the shaver actually shakes the hand when you try to shave( very unpleasant)....Don't know if this is all the Braun models or just this one, but will return this one, and go back to Norelco. Do not recommend this model to anyone."
2,2 stars,"I gave this razor two tries and it did a very poor job. The motor was not powerful enough to cut without bogging down. 10 passes in one area still left uncut stubble. I went over the same area with my 8+ year old Panasonic, that this shaver was supposed to replace, and it did a pretty good job of cleaning up what the Braun 1775 left behind. The trimmer did a good job."
2,Braun 1775 electric razor,"Braun 1775: Like others, I found that despite my scrupulous care, the foil popped a hole in a couple of months, not 18 as claimed by Braun. I'm writing them for an explanation and/or replacement. I'm certainly not going to buy a new foil, since they require you to buy a new cutter block for which even Amazon charges $20. That's more than half the price of a new razor."
4,great for travel,"I travel alot for work, so It's not always convenient for me to use a straight razor, so this is a great alternative to it. In fact, lately I've been using this at home lol. It's alot thinner than I thought it would be, and the battery life is great, and i can get just as close a shave as my Gillette Sensor razor. an added bonus is that you can use this while it charges. this is helpful because in my bathroom at home, you need to have the light on for the bathroom outlets to work. the result of this is that often times i think my razor is charging, when really it's not, and I can just plug it in in the morning and take care of business.Probably the best razor I've had since college, and you can't beat the price."
3,"Close, but not close enough","A product highly rated by a consumer magazine. That's why I bought it. Now that I own it, let me describe some shortcomings. The on-off button can be easily turned off when shaving. Ouch. The trimmer head doesn't have enough of a clearance for getting at tight spots. Yes, it trims sideburns, but that's about it. It does provide a close shave and works well when you shave everyday. But when you let it grow over a weekend, it has to work really hard. I had an expensive razor before, this one is 1/4 of the price. It did present a better value than the expensive razor I used before. If it wasn't for the price, I wouldn't buy it."
2,Foil distintegrated after 3 months of use - disappointing,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 78-year-old father, who hadn't used an electric razor in over 25 years. He loved how it operated and the fact that you could rinse it off, and it gave a fairly close shave. After 3 months of use, however, he noticed that the foil was scratching him as he shaved. He discovered that the metal was literally flaking apart. We're hoping it was just a bad lot and will try to get a replacement, but I'm very disappointed to have this hassle to deal with."
4,"Very good, excellent price","This shaver is definitely a great electric shaver at a great price.I've had mine for nearly 2 years now. It is still running as strong as the day that I bought it. It doesn't shave as closely as some of the top-of-the-line electric shavers, but for the money, it does an awesome job.This thing is simple, easy to use, and it is a shaver that will last you for years without issue.I haven't even changed the blades on it yet (after 2 years of use)!!!Anyway, I use this when I don't feel like using my Fusion, and it's a great starter electric shaver."
3,Good Value,"The 1775 is a fairly good value because it's inexpensive, but it takes me 20-30 minutes to get a good shave with it because I have to go over each area of my beard several times to get it close. Lectric Shave helps, although Braun does not recommend using it.I had one problem in the first two weeks with the shaver: the foil developed a hole for no apparent reason. After calling Braun customer service, they shipped me a new one promptly and I have had no further troubles. Ironically, I was not using Lectric Shave with it at the time."
3,Decent....,"I bought this as an entry into the electric razor category. I have always ever used a regular razor, and I have a very tough beard that grows in different directions. I've used this for a couple weeks and it works ok. What I end up doing is going back and forth with the electric and then quickly cleaning up all the stubble that it couldn't get with a regular razor. What it does seem to do is pull the hairs further up to the surface so that when I go over my face with the razor it gets smoother than if I just used the razor by itself. For those of you with tough beards, don't expect that this will replace your regular razor. It's good to clean up the 5 oclock shadow, and it's a good ""pre-shave"", however I still need to use the old fashioned straight blade to get a clean close shave."
5,Quiet,"I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. It has a closer shave than a razor, and it is very quiet and simple to operate."
2,Two and a half stars .....,"Braun's blurb about this model tells it like it is: ""The perfect shaver series from Braun for demanding beginners .... ""I should have believed it. My Braun 6520 was much better. I wish I could get it fixed."
1,Won't be listening to Amazon reviews again...,"I bought this razor based on all the very positive reviews on Amazon. That was a mistake. This thing does not work. My housemates were baffled at how exceptionally awful it was - I've never actually had as hard a time shaving as I did with this pathetic device. I can't put this any other way - it doesn't work. It can handle my upper lip and chin okay, but is completely useless on my neck or cheeks. In that it achieves nothing. No matter how many different ways I've tried using this thing it failed miserably. Couldn't recommend this to anybody."
1,would not cut,This same model shaved well for me for over a year but I lost it during travel. The replacement arrived in standard package that appeared a little repaired or corrected. I soon discovered that the unit would not cut my beard at all. Most of my investment was refunded but the supplier would not accept a return of used personal items for full refund.
1,Avoid Univeral Mania,Follow-up.Univeral Mania will not answer emails. I called them and they told me they would call me right back.It didn't happen. Now I can't get anyone to answer the phone.
1,Not good if you are a manual bladed razor guy,"I have heard good reviews especially from a friend who recommended it in the first place.What I noticed is that this guy has always used electric razors in the first place. He is already used to this kind of products.I have always used traditional 2, 3 and 5 bladed razors, and wet shaving in general. Going to dry shaving with an electric razor (or at least this one), is definitely a downgrade.I just did multiple passes (5+, I lost count), and my beard was still there albeit just a little bit shorter.I have to mention though, I didn't wait the recommended 14 days of trial for my skin ""to get used to"". After the initial result I was utterly disappointed and changed to the Gillette Fusion Power 5 bladed razor."
1,Worse shave ever from Braun,"I purchased the Braun model 1775 one month ago. I get a terrible shave and burn feeling on my skin, It does not even cut my neck hairs.I will go back to a Remington or Norelco rotary blade."
2,Very Disappointed,"Very disappointed with this razor. It does not shave a close as a blade by any means, in fact, I have had to reshave each morning with a blade after using this. I would not recommend that anyone purchase this razor. It stated that you need to wait three weeks ""to allow your skin to adjust"", but in the meantime, are you supposed to go to work each morning looking like you used a dull butter knife to shave with?!?! Not me."
2,not impressed,"I got the Braun 1775 FreeControl Rechargeable, Washable Men's Shaver for my husband, whose sight is impaired. It did NOT do the job we had hoped and he was left with quite a bit of stubble. The trimmer worked well, but the main part of the razor was disappointing."
3,No match when it comes to Norelco.,"This Electric Shaver is overpriced. Norelco outperforms this product in more ways than one. I'm a proud owner of a Norelco 835RX, which I purchased from Sears in 1994 and its still in good shape and gives me a clean comfortable shave. My warranty is up on this razor, hence I have no choice but use it as an emmergency shaver till my Norelco quits on me."
3,Satisfied Customer,This is a good razor for the cost compared to the cost of other razors.It seems to work better than the older models of Braun. It's easy to use and clean.
1,Just doesn't work,"I bought this as a gift for my brother. He had one of the first electric razors and it was so old and beat up, I figured he needed a new one. About a month after I gave it to him, I noticed he was still using the old one. I asked him why. His answer: the old one works better. An 8-year-old $20 electric razor was superior to this brand new product. He said that the couple times he tried to use it, there were whole areas of his face it could not shave. My brother has a normal face.Total failure, Braun."
3,Good value but some drawbacks,"The value of this razor, at ~$35, is high. It does perform well, for the money, and the ability to wash it with water makes it useful on the road. If you have sensitive skin be warned, you will find the razor can make your neck look like you were wearing a beard of bees. I do not use this as my daily shaver but it has been there in a pinch and I think you will find it useful if you travel."
5,Great deal,"As good as anything costing 5x the price, if not more. Very easy to hold due to slim design and shaves quite close for an electric razor, especially for someone like me who has a heavy beard."
4,Very good for the price,This is the second one I have owned. The first one I damaged by mistake. Very good for light use (my beard is light). The battery charge seems to last a very long time.
1,Don't waste your time or money,"This was my third Braun Razor, and I'm sending it back to Braun. The previous two mid range models I owned were great. But the 1775 FreeControl was just too far of a downgrade. When my 5415 Flexintegral died I figured Braun's quality of product was good, so it didn't matter what model I got - I was wrong.The freecontrol is:-loud-short on battery life-poor on shaving (need to go over the same spot many times)-the long hair trimmer comes out weird so that it's hard to trim sideburns-and doesn't shave as close (especially chin area)-irritates my skin more"
4,Satisfied,"Good product for the price.Shaves well.Noisier than typical shaver. Location of On/Off button is such that it is too easily bumped and thus turned off during shaving, so you wind up grasping shaver in unnatural manner (to avoid touching the Off button)."
2,Mixed Feelings,"Not terribly impressed with this. Worked on my cheeks but left prominent patches of whiskers on my chin. I haven't used an electric that's come nearly as close to a good shave as a blade -- the more expensive Braun model came closer than this one, though. Stick with a blade if you can."
1,Product problems,"I bought this shaver for my grandson for Christmas it doesn't work!!! He didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me it was ineffective and did not work on his face. I had him bring to me and I tried it ..IT DOES NOT WORK..it makes noise but does not shave. What a waste of money. It is passed the return time, so I am stuck with a product that is useless to us. Sorry I ever bought it even though the reviews were good I must have gotten a bad one. So if you buy this product try it at once and see if it is defective so you to don't get stuck with junk like I did.It is getting a one because you have to put something it deserves -1 for the product"
4,Braun 1775,This review is NOT the 1775 but rather the series 1 150 model which I understand is the close replacement. The reviews that I had read was for the 1775 which seems superior to this model.The 150 model performs okay but I was shipped it instead of the ordered 1775 without any notification even though quanties of the 1775 were listed on hand.
5,close shave,I have had this Braun series 1 for a few weeks now and I can honestly say this is the best electric razer I have ever owned. The charge lasts twice as long as my old Norelco and shaves almost as close as a blade. It has a natural fit into my hand and does not take nearly as long to shave as my old one. My only gripe is it should have come with a pouch or case to store it in.
2,Braun Shaver,Did not shave as well as Norelco. Easy to use and clean but left some whiskers which eventually got long and obvious.
3,Braun Razor,"It works OK, have to go over my face MANY times in order for it to shave all the hairs. Never been an electric shaver kind of person, so I am not sure if that is what it is normally like."
3,Shaver review,"Bought this to replace an old reliable Grundig shaver that I had been using for many years. The shaver had unfortunately slipped out of my hand one evening, hit the sink hard, and broke. This Braun model is lighter and less bulky than my old one, and shaves faster and closer due to the sharper cutters. This model, however, has a hard plastic removable shield (foil protection cap) that protects the foil/cutter assembly from getting damaged. My old Grundig shaver had a built-in hard rubber wrap-around which was more convenient and easier to apply. My old shaver also had a long-hair trimmer that popped out further, had a wider surface area, and just worker better than this one. On the positive side, this model is easier and faster to clean wayward bristles from."
3,Not as good as Norelco,I've used Nerelco's and Remingtons in the past. I thought I'd give the Braun a try. Review is based on 1 month of usage:+Excellent beard / mustache trimmer (much better then Norelco)Washable for easy cleaningCompactLong lasting charge - 2 weeks-Need multiple passes to get a close shave.2 day beard can be a challenge...Needed the old Norelco toget the longer side growing hairs.Power switch to easy to turn off while shaving - ouch!Clear plastic protector not easy to remove.I will probably by a new Norelco to replace.
2,Not impressive,"I bought this shaver since it was time to replace the blades of my Remington and this piece cost only a little more than replacement blades.I am very disappointed with this shaver. It doesn't give a close shave at all. Its really awful on the neck and regions below below chin. Absolutely useless. It charges quickly and holds the charge for long, but what good when it doesn't shave properly. I have decided to junk this and buy a better one. My old shaver itself is comparatively many times better.I would NOT recommend this product."
5,Why are razors still selling?,"This shaver is the best. It deserves all the praises it gets here. It kinda makes you wonder how razors still sell. They irritate (big time), they cut, you need a wet face, you need to change the blades, and, most importantly, you need shaving cream.Cha Chingg. Why has man put up with this for so long you may ask. Simply put, to achieve that smooth irresistible face the ladies like, you know what i'm talking about. Guess what, this 1775 gets you there (seriously) with a zero percent chance of cuts or those nasty razor bumps. It stays in the car so on my way to work, after just a few passes,i'm all set."
3,It works. Very affordable. Good value,Pros: It works. Very affordable. Good value.Cons: Noisy. It is still within my expectation.
2,Not great,"Have mostly used rotary shavers in the past; bought this one based on price and brand name. Product quality is fine but performance is not a match for the rotary shaver. This shaver is for occasional only use, and its performance is not bad enough to warrant the hassle of returning it to the manufacturer, under their 30 day money-back program. Would not recommend it."
4,Great bargain,I bought this particular electric as I have a partial beard and need to shave around it. The single cutting bar works best for this.I have only had it a short time but so far its great.
3,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this razor, it didnt shave as close as I expected. It also misses places. May be OK for the price."
2,not what expected,Not the best. It doesn't shave as close as I would've liked it to on my boyfriend.
3,works,works fairly well but leaves some hairs which grow out it takes a reasonable amount of time to shave with it.
2,Long Hair Trimmer Breaks Easily,"I've been through two of these, and both have had their long-hair trimmer break. The motor keeps going, but the trimmer blades either no longer move at all or no longer move enough to cut hair. The regular shaving mechanism still works on both, but it without the long-hair trimmer, some hairs are impossible to cut. The second one lasted almost exactly one year before it broke."
3,just OK,"I've owned Braun shavers since the mid-seventies and have been very satified with them. When my last Braun finally bit the dust, I decided to try this one. It seemed to be a good deal and I needed something to shave with. This particular Braun is just OK. I've noticed Braun's quality steadily decline over the years. They're still decent shavers, but not like they used to be. I ended up giving this one to my wife to use on her legs and she basically never uses it. I've since discovered the Remington Titanium series shavers. Those are now my favorites, especially for the price, (about 1/2 to 1/3 the price of a comparable Braun). They're not as quiet as a Braun shaver, but much more comfortable and shave far closer."
2,Braun Series 1 - 190 Men's Shaver,"Product was sent with a 220 plug. This was a Christmas gift for my father and he can't even use it. Our address is US so there should have been no reason for the European plug. Can't really tell you if the razor is any good or not. No way to try it. Sent an e-mail and they called and said they would send an adapter plug, but this has been over a week ago and we're still waiting. Have sent another e-mail, will let you know. My dad still hasn't been able to use his razor.1-11-2013 back again, they sent the wrong adapter!!!!! This is really getting old."
5,Great Shaver,"Note: The Braun 1775 is the same product as the Braun Series-1 190. I ordered the 1775 but got the 190 from the seller. Either way this is an excellent product.I replaced my corded Remington DA-57 twin foil razor because the trimmer was coming apart and also because I could no longer buy replacement foils locally.The 1775/190 is a worthy successor. Not especially a ""better"" shave but equal in quality. It is a bit quieter. I am liking the single cutter design very well and it is easier to adjust to various locations and directions of hair growth.Years ago I tried cordless and found that pretty soon I could not get a single shave from one charge. I am hoping this unit will not reach that level too soon, but fortunately, this shaver will run when plugged in and they ship a nice coiled cord.I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Too bad it is discontinued. Braun would be wise to always offer a modestly priced, basic, corded razor. We are not all free range shavers!"
4,A good close shave.,This is a quality product and produces a nice close shave. It is also rated high in Consumer Reports.I would purchase it again.
4,Made Me A Convert,"Like many others, I tried electric years ago, didn't like it, left stubble, gave up on them, used traditional razors for decades. Traditional shaving with a razor - soapy foamy scummy hairy mess to clean up and clog sinks, mirror fogs so you can't see what you're doing, hard to get spots - peach fuzz on back of ear as an example, hard to shave. Oh - and those never-stop-bleeding razor cuts. - and you're always running out of something. If it isn't razors, it's shaving cream.Bottom line. Great product, good value. I used to ""not see"" how people used these things. Now I ""don't see"" why people still use manual blade shaving. I really can't see myself ever going back to a manual blade - ever. I'm a complete convert due to this Braun model. Of course, as always, your mileage may vary. You need to give your face about a month to get used to an electric. Not as close as a razor but close enough and much faster, a bit more economical, and less messy."
2,NOT SO GREAT!,"I found that I could not get a close shave, if I was working I would have to shave later in the day to get by. Luckily I am retired so no problem. I also cannot cut some of the beard on the lower part of my neck and have to use the trimmer to cut any long hairs. Not as good as my old Norelco.."
5,Must have for all Dads!,"My husband, who is a really involved Dad, often bemoaned the fact that we had several ""mommy"" books, but it was difficult to find ""daddy"" books, so I ordered this one for him for Father's Day. It very matter-of-factly states all of the different kinds of activities that different kinds of daddies do, from baking cookies, to getting donuts, to working at home to working far away. It is an excellent complement to Todd Parr's ""The Mommy Book,"" which has an equally inclusive of the many different kinds of activities that mommies can do. Ultimately, the message is that all daddies are different, and daddies do all kinds of different things, but daddies love their kids and they want them to be the best people that they can be. My three year old daughter keeps both ""The Mommy Book"" and ""The Daddy Book"" in her stash of books in her room that she can ""read"" all of the time."
1,Ugh!,"I bought this based on glowing reviews...I was very disappointed. First of all, the book is SO politically correct that it steps over itself and forgets to be interesting or fun. It makes sure to point out that some daddies cook, and some daddies work...etc, etc--too much. Plus, my son didn't care for the drawings."
4,Child and Daddy both loved it,"I brought this home for my husband to read to our small daughter. The bright colors kept her attention, and the recurrent theme that daddies loves their kids was a good message for her. It was a whimsical read for Daddy, fun for my child, I recommend this, especially if you need a bit of daddy/child bonding time."
3,Asian Baby :),"okay, so i ordered this as a joke present for my friend jessie, and we were like really excited, and when i got it i was extremely dissapointed to find that it was microscopic! i thought it was like going to be like a real baby but apparently, i was mistaken! what is this!? a doll for ants? hahaha.no, but otherwise, i like it. it is VERY durable.:D"
4,"nice, easy, pretty interesting read","Where some have mentioned the author as coming across a bit narcissistic and perhaps as having embellished her memoirs, the read is still quite enjoyable. Having done as many different things and having met as many interesting people as Ms. Nichols has indeed done, it's not surprising that she may seem a little self impressed or perhaps even proud of her accomplishments. Regardless of what you think of her, the book itself is a light, good hearted, at times funny diversion. Trekkers will like the latter half more, but even the non-Trek stuff was rather interesting (not screamingly so, but nevertheless more than I had imagined.)"
3,"An interesting, albeit melodramatic Star Trek memoir.","Nichelle Nichols's character of Uhura served as an important role model for minorities as one of the first regularly appearing African American characters on television (and an officer!). For this reason, Nichols memories of Star Trek are interesting and enjoyable (but perhaps a bit exagerated)."
5,THE PERFECT JAZZ ALBUM THAT'S JUST RIGHT FOR THE HOLIDAYS,"If you're entertaining the fine wine crowd, or just some of your beer drinkin' beer buddies, this is the Compact Disc you'd want to have loaded in your changer (Along with the other All-Time Christmas Favorites). Nothing wild 'n crazy, just some real coooool jazz from the same Trio that brought you hits like: ""The 'In' Crowd"", ""Hang On Sloopy"", and ""A Hard Day's Night""! Only this time around their in a more relaxed Christmas setting. IMPORTANT NOTE: Make SURE the you get the 'Original' on CHESS/MCA (Universal) and NOT THIS POORLY RECORDED BOOTLEG ENTITLED ""Holiday Favorites"" that some sellers are trying to sell!"
4,Groovy Baby!,"So I buy this CD on a whim - and it's not bad! Kinda like a 60's jetsetter's soundtrack. A few standout tracks from this are ""Jerko"" - which has a nice beat to it and will make you want to groove a bit and ""Mannix"".I would reccomend this to anyone who just wants to sit back, grab a mai tai and relax. The music is fun, bouncy, caribbean infused pop. This album doesn't have anything profound to say about the world, but then again it doesn't have to."
3,Great customer service,"Unfortunately, the product was defective, meaning the ears were positioned slightly off center, so when I put it on, they were not directly on top of my head but off to the side. And since the ears are not moldable (meaning there's flexible plastic inside the ears, but you can't bend them and have them hold a position) I could not make them work for me. But based on the extremely low price, I'm not super surprised at the defective quality.HOWEVER, this is a big HOWEVER, based on that price, I was prepared to just throw them away, but took a chance on returning them. Within a day, I received a response to my request and they just automatically refunded the cost of the product AND shipping and instructed me to discard the product. Great, no hassle customer service!! I really wanted to give them more stars because good service can be so hard to find, but I couldn't since the product itself was defective."
5,Seeger and Guthrie and what they stood for,"This was the first folk album I ever bought and lead me to Pete Seeger, Woody Gutherie, Huddie Ledbetter, blues and bluegrass.Unions are currently looked down upon because the history of labor is not taught and is practically unknown. Thank them for your five day work week and eight hour work day. These are the songs sung to inspire the laborers and still inspire today.Great stuff."
4,Excellent for the right audience,This book does an excellent job of introducing the reader to the concept of applying Statistical Process Control. Through a great number of mini case studies it shows a number of possible applications. Probably more importantly it amply demonstrates the when to be concerned and when to continue monitoring the situation before reacting.This is NOT a technical book. The few formulae that are presented are relegated to a small appendix and are virtually unusable. This makes the book more suitable for administrators than for quants.People actually conducting the studies will not find what they need in terms of formulae. They will find what they need to understand which type of chart is appropriate and how to interpret the results.Ideally the authors should have included software to actually do the calculations. This would have allowed the non-technical people to actually do their own studies rather than just interpet what others have done.
4,Healthcare Quality,"This is a good book to introduce health care workers to statistical use of health related data using control charts and basic principles of statistic analysis. Good because it is not the usual text based on manufacturing. Most healthcare folks have a hard time seeing the use of measuring ""widgets""."
1,Horrible,"Out of all the quality books I have read, this one worst. Mr. Carey has neither the know-how or scope to fully take on any of the issues at hand."
1,mother-bored,"According to all documentation on this board, there should have been a 100 meghtz ethernet port on this board.There is not. I did not return it because I was in a time constraint. I installed an ethernet card and wrote it off as an Amazon normal operating proceedure. I will be more discerning on my next purchase."
4,A really great read,This is a really great read. Very well written and scoped out and the story is told very well. I would say one of Dick Francis's best novels that I have read. The main character is very sympathetic. A couple of aspects of the story stretch belief a bit but generally good. Interesting commentary on physical challenges.
4,isn't the dobro fun?,"it just sounds great, so fat and plump. and it sounds even better on the lap, which is how this book teaches it. no upright style here, but if you're interested there's an appendix on how to turn your normal guitar into one. endless styles explored: bluegrass, blues, old-time, hawaiian, western swing, modern country. not to mention bits on history, more tunings, and other useful miscellany. it's just a good ol' time and a great place to start."
2,Okay for Aussies,"This book was okay if you live in Australia. Otherwise it's not worth much. All of the suggested resources are purely downunder. If the authors wish to sell this book in the U.S., they should follow their own advise and to the research top side."
1,A grievous misnomer,"If you take nothing else away from this review, let it be this: THE MANDAEANS DO NOT PRACTICE BLACK MAGIC OF ANY KIND! They have practices of making engraved pottery items which can to the casual observer seem like magic charms or something of the like, but the Mandaean faith explicitly forbids the practice of anything involving the occult. Buy this book only for historical insight into how desperate some people are to try and make some otherwise innocuous belief system the ""next big thing"" by dressing it up like something it's not."
5,The Rocky Story - 'the one and only',"If, like me, you were considering buying a Rocky soundtrack for work-outs and excercise, this is the best to buy. Though the CD doesn't have all the soundtracks to all the Rocky films, it certainly has the finest tunes to train to. It is the equivalent of a personal coach and faith healer on CD that will command your body with a strength you didn't know you possessed. Admittedly, much of the music is from Rocky IV, but lets face it, IV was arguably the best of the Rocky films, and so was its soundtrack. It's very simple, this CD takes the cream of the crop and gives you over 35 minutes of unadultered Rocky training passion. Buy it and you won't know how you could train without it. WIN ROCKY, WIN!"
2,Just Listen 'N Learn Italian,"I did not find this CD useful. It was advertised as listen and learn. I am going on a trip to Italy and I wanted to become familiar with the language. I have a 45-minute drive to work each day and wanted something to listen to on the way that would familiarize me with the language. This CD requires constant interaction with the book, which doesn't work well driving to work. Most the CD is in Italian, but without the book there is very little English translation."
4,"Very good course for practical, spoken Italian","This is a well paced course suitable for someone just starting Italian. At first, the taped conversations can be frustrating, because most are recorded live ""on location"", using real native speakers in real life situations. However, there is a full transcript of each conversation, along with vocabulary and an explanation of grammatical points. (I actually ended up wishing that the book concentrated MORE on grammar, although most people probably prefer less.) One of the few improvements that could be made would be an explanation of the stress patterns in Italian words, which would make it easy for the reader to know exactly how to pronounce a word or verb form that appeared only in print, but not in the dialogues. This is NOT intended to teach you just a few ""set"" phrases for use during short trip to Italy or to an Italian restaurant. Instead, it's meant to help you understand and converse in Italian in real life situations."
3,Listen and read and learn,"If you are looking for a tape/cd to learn by during your commute; this is probably not the right program for you. If you have time to also do the book excerices then this would be good.The dialogs seem to be authentic and are helpful in learning what an announcement on a train, in the train station, or airport sound like. However, IMHO there's too much time spent on reading you instructions and listening. Since speaking is an essential component, I would have preferred more opportunity to speak/ repeat key phrases."
3,listen and learn,Very good CDs however it is not all listen & learn. There is alot to do and review in the book so not meant for learning while driving. A bit dated since the CDs mention they are tapes and that Lira is the currency of Italy.
3,Needful Product,"If you open canned food for a pet, then this is a necessity. Great for storing food until ""next time'. Thanks"
5,Perfect,Works perfectly. No more messy cans of dog food in the fridge. I wish I would have purchased these a long time ago.
3,Lids,"I received two colored lids, a pink and a green color. I am disappointed because I though tone of the lids would fit smaller cans like for cat food."
3,"Ok for small cans, not so good for larger cans","These lids work OK for small cans, but the large cans do not properly seal. I tried multiple dog food cans and some fruit cans with the same result."
1,Crap Lids,"The lids I received were not white as depicted. They are, instead, bright primary colors. Furthermore, they are thin, flimsy plastic."
5,Super customer service,This company has outstanding customer service! I actually think the company president uses his own product---great product and great service!
2,Bad series of clichés,"I did want to like this. I like Jimmy Smits. I like court and police dramas. I like most series related to legal issues. I even like the supposed ideology of this thing. But this is bad. Badly written, badly thought, badly put together. Each and every episode, scene, and character is a bad cliché. It is painful to watch."
1,"Ridicules premise, painful to watch",This is an awful show. The premise is so ridicules that its painful to watch.
5,Great idea for the magic to work! A page-turner!,"Bailey Bond is a grumpy twelve-year old who is being forced to stay with his cousins, who hate him. He spys on them, and says mean things about Carl and Anna, and gets Ingrid into hysterics, but when the magic begins to work, Bailey Bond is the master. None of the other children can work it. But while the magic is lots of fun, it has ups and downs, and it turns into one hilarious adventure after another as the four children look for Fox, Bailey's lost dog."
2,Shows all of Ludlum's flaws as a writer,"If you like Ludlum, read one of his later works.""The Scarlatti Inheritance"" showcases all his flaws asa writer.Ludlum can indeed handle certain techniques of a suspensenovel -- the buildup of tension, the explosive scene, etc.Unfortunately, his flaws ruin the pleasure of reading this book.* His characters are paper-thin.* He's sloppy with background details. In this particular book,for example, historical details are wrong and/or misinterpeted,and the German dialog is grammatically and/or idiomatically incorrect.* Excessive reliance on ""deus ex machina"" plot devices.Summary: If you like the type of suspense Ludlum writes,you'd be better off reading someone like Trevanian."
3,Typical Hitler tale,"What is it about Hitler that so intrigues many writers? It's like you're not a complete writer until you have written at least one book about the madman. Well, this is Ludlum's college try and while it is intriguing in parts, dramatic in others, it is - and I hate to use this term - utterly predictable. Who didn't know the real identity of everyone involved and the ultimate outcome?This is an OK read but kind of rough around the edges. I guess my main complaint is that it is just too conventional."
4,"Ordered wrong Ludlum book, but that's OK","Read this a long time ago. Wanted to read again. Wasn't the one I thought, but that's OK. I'll just order the other one later. All Ludlum's old books are good. Very page turning."
4,An entertaining book!,Elizabeth's son was the personification of evil.He was aligned with very shadowy characters when he was a very young man. His very lovely wife was mistreated by him. His mother did not like the monster that was her child. He joined forces with one of the greatest sources of evil by combining forces with Adolph Hitler and the Nazis. Elizabeth Scarlatti was correct to consider her son dangerous. The goodguy in the person of the field officer was also effective. A different written Ludlum book but still interesting.
2,ludlum was lucky to be given a second chance,"ludlum can perhaps thank his lucky stars he made his name elsewhere before starting to write thrillers, since not many other authors would have been given another chance after producing something as muddled as this. the opening and final chapters are ghastly, veering from sheer incomprehensibility to juvenilia. the idea isn't bad and the rest of the book chugs along, but how did he get away with that opening? without reading the rest of the book it makes no sense at all and strikes me as being more likely to repel rather than suck in the reader."
1,Didn't receive expected hardcover edition,"I received the smaller/shorter ""book club"" hardcover edition and that is NOT the edition I ordered. Very disappointed!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This is my first Ludlum book and it is sure to be my last. The plot is preposterous because of Ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history. Once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away. It starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some ""weapon"" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars! Hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania. Some spoiled, rich American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history. I know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest. If you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department."
2,Not Ludlum's Best,"The Scarlatti Inheritence reads slowly and is somewhat uninteresting for Ludlum fans. The plot is not as thrilling or embedded as Ludlum readers are accustomed to. Additionally, the plot is revealed early on to the astute reader. It is a novel that one can begin, but not necessarily feel compelled to finish immediately."
4,"hmm, not the best, but worth the read","The Scarlatti Inheritance is a good book. It's best ingredient is the vivid imagination of Mr. Ludlum and his ability to weave a fine plot and have it unfold at a good pace. This book hits the same key that many others do: Nazis and the Third Reich, but it is very original in plot and hero, or as it were, heroine. The ending isn't necessarily what you might expect from Ludlum, but it is definately appropriate. This is worth your plane ride, so read it."
4,The Scarlatti Inheritance,"I have read a few Robert Ludlum books, and I am a big fan. But I am not going to gush over this one. It takes a long time to get going. The background necessary for the action ending to work is nearly two thirds of the novel. I got the feeling that Ludlum had to do it that way, as though he was saying, ""I had to tell you all that in order to tell you this little story."" On that level, it is not one of Ludlum's best, in my opinion.However, it will not keep me from buying his work and eventually reading all of his novels."
5,"Ludlum's first book, first edition, first printing","This was a great find Ludlums first book under his real name, first edition, first printing, all it needs now is a dustjacket. This item was very well packaged by the seller. Had a lot of fingerprints on the hard cover, but they were easily wiped off.Book arrived in much better shape than the new book I ordered gift wrapped from Amazon. Who put the book in a box that was too big all around. Put in a sheet of bubble wrao, the gift wrapped book and another sheet of bubble wrap and closed the box. Well you can imagine what shape the corners were in as well as the gift wrap after sliding around in that box everytine the UPS truck turned a corner.Kudos for this Seller/Shipper great job."
5,You cannot understand Lord of the Rings without reading it,"You just cannot understand the wonderful Lord of the Rings trilogy in print or on screen without reading this wonderful book. The authors are both insightful, easy to read and great fun - buy this book before you go and read the books again! Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE and WHOSE SIDE IS GOD ON?"
3,"Same book as ""Concise Guide"" by Duriez","This is the same book asThe J. R. R. Tolkien Handbook: A Concise Guide to His Life, Writings, and World of Middle-Earth. I accidentally ordered this ""Comprehensive Guide"" thinking it was different from the ""Concise Guide"".As far as the content of the book, it's basically a glossary of the themes, characters, and places that appear in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. As such, it's more of a reference guide for seasoned Tolkien veterans rather than Middle Earth beginners.Duriez shares some interesting commentary on the Fall of Man, Tolkien's essay ""Beowulf: Monsters and the Critics"", dragons, Elves, the hero, and light vs. darkness.For the Tolkien enthusiast, this book definitely qualifies as a ""nice to have"" rather than a ""must have."
3,"Far, far from his best . . .","Benford can be infuriatingly inconsistent in the style and quality of his writing, but the occasional winner keeps me reading his stuff. This one is a combination of speculative particle physics (pretty good), Mycenaean archaeology (acceptable), and neo-fascist Greek machismo politics (mediocre). Claire the archaeologist and John the mathematician are both reasonably well-drawn, but the character of Kontos, the Greek archaeologist-com-colonel, is grotesquely overdone. Unlike most adventure novels, the latter part of the book is actually better written than the early part."
2,"great idea, lousy implementation","The SF premise -- which you'll get to eventually if you stick with it -- is neat. But most of the actual text is dull. The main character is unlikable -- she's an academic who's irresponsible, immature, drives recklessly, parks illegally and throws out the tickets, etc. At first I thought there'd be some good reason for these unrespectable traits, but there never is; at the end, when she marries the other protagonist (a somewhat more likeable fellow), I felt sorry for him.The antagonist, on the other hand, is so overdone as to be unbelievable. And I almost liked him better than the protagonist anyway.I think Benford has good potential, and I love the physics, but this book was not enjoyable."
5,Great book,"I'd started reading it when I was a kid, and it disappeared. Asked on a board online, and someone gave me the name. That's how much an impression it made on me when I was a kid... I remembered it 22 years after I first picked it up."
2,Could be shorter,"Very good hard SF premise, but the novel includes a lot of fluff, developing [bad] characters. I think if the story were condensed to 100 pages, it would be hugo-quality."
3,Have a Physics Text Handy!,"Benford grabs you early with interesting characters, a mesmerizing premise, and international intrigue. The story opens invitingly, drawing you in with its gravitational pull, luring you to the anticipated finish, and then....it reminds you of all the stuff you didn't learn in physics class. Benford weaves a fascinating tale in layman's terms for about 80 percent of the story, then resorts to Einsteinian (at least to those of us who are not scientists) concepts to finish the story. A good advanture, but you'll need a Cliff's notes of your college physics text by your side as the plot collapses under its science-heavy gravitational force. With some less lofty language, this book could avoid being a neutron ""bomb."""
1,A disappointment,"Benford is a solid writer, and i ahve enjoyed many of his novels (including Timescape, which I recommend highly) but this is a slow-moving novel with stock (and not very interesting) characters. The science-fiction aspects of the novel are VERY interesting, but without a solid plot anc charcters to back them up, it all falls apart. A major disappointment."
2,You need a physics degree to follow this one,"And I don't have that degree. Fortunately I do have advanced math and some engineering physics under my metaphorical belt, otherwise I would've been completely lost when reading this book. As it was I was only lost about half of the time.All the elements of a good story are here, a mystery, interesting characters and conflict, but the author just doesn't seem to know how to pull it all together successfully. For every step the plot or character development advances, you're slapped with a load of technobabble. A little science is good, too much and you're writing a technical manual, not a sci-fi novel.I really was intrigued by this mysterious artifact and what it ended up containing, and by the character conflicts, but overall it was just impossible to focus on any of that when trying to wade through yet *another* round of math/chemistry/physics lectures.Give this one a miss, unless of course reading textbooks is your idea of a good time."
2,Definitely not his best,"I would love to say that I liked this book. I certainly tried to like it.However, the characters were one-dimensional, and seemingly defined entirely by one flaw, tic or trait. For example: the female lead smokes, but we're never told how she feels about herself smoking, why she smokes, what it feels like, why she's lighting up at that particular moment, simply that she does, in fact smoke. Not all that interesting when there's no context.Worse: the underlying ""big concept"", which is primarily why I like to read science fiction, was just not that interesting. Macro-sized quantum particles could be fascinating, but his implementation of the idea was simply ho-hum.In short, one idea, one dimensional characters, no genuine dramatic tension, no page-turning momentum, and rather a waste of money.Buy it only if you plan to use it as a sleep aid."
1,[Weak],"I found the science vaguely interesting (particle erotique); but the main premise of an adventure -- which this novel pretends to be -- is likeable characters; and it is here that the book fails. Also: the Greece of the novel is cartoonish; it feels like a bad Latin-American country in a Hollywood movie. Finally: the heroine's Bostonian mother must have been some ingenuous Baroque music buff to listen to a piece for harpsichord by Vivaldi (of all the composers)... While I understand that a sci-fi writer doesn't need to show superior sensitivity and taste, I hate it when a writer of sorts tries to fool the reader. Just stick to your Einstein, Mr. Benford."
3,Customer service a 10,"I received my order and was not pleased with the freshness of the product.However, the distributor read my review and reimbursed me the full price.I give them a 10 for customer service. Pretty spectacular in this day and age.They have fully redeemed themselves........a ""BIG THANK-YOU!!!!"
4,I take back my original comment,"After finishing the book I take back my original comment. The book reedemed itself to me after finishing the initial build up. There were a lot of brutal vivid scenes that cut into my fevered brain like a butcher slicing through a tendon on a swinging cattle carcass. The ending was a growing nightmare of claustraphobia, impending doom and bloody gore. I would definitely recommend this book now. A disembowling experience of epic preportions. Gerard is possibly one of the finest poets of gore and mayhem to grace this century."
2,Should be titled slow road to boredom,"Really enjoyed ""The Beast Called Max"", couldnt put it down but I'm having a really hard time even finishing this book. There doesnt seem to be much of anytning happening in this book, a lot of the exciting action sequences that made the first book move so quickly have been taken out. I'm already more then halfway through the book and nothing much has happened besides describing how Max is getting more human feelings, blah, blah, blah. The meeting with Kali was pretty interesting but thats about it and I hate to say it but even the twins are pretty subdued in this book. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book but please try other Gerard Houarner books, he is a excellent writer and I think maybe he just got bored of this character and ran out of ideas, not recommended."
5,Comprehensive hands-on guide,I've found this book very useful as a way to get to know my way around the WebSphere Studio V5 tools. I especially valued the treatment of EJB transactions and guidance on using the Java Profiler. If you need to make good use of the tool and you could do with a brush up on key J2EE concepts then this book is for you.
1,Absolutely no support - outdated,Please don't buy this book. Material is no longer pertinent nor supported. IBM Press has a more applicable book for the renamed WebSphere Studio...
1,CD is missing 3 of 4 listening tests!,"The main problem with this otherwise good book is that about half of the book is IELTS practice tests, which is fine. That means there are 4 parts (listening, reading, writing and speaking) for each. The big problem is that the CD only contains the audio for the first listening test. They didn't bother to record audio for tests 2-4. So they may as well not have been written, because obviously there is no way to test your listening if there's nothing to listen to. A big boo and hiss to Barron's for putting out this incomplete package. I gladly would have paid the extra money it would have cost to pay for the one extra CD. As it is, I have to go buy some other book and CD now."
3,3 missing listening tests!,I agree with everyone who has complained about the fact that the four tests are incomplete. The CD only gives ONE listening test! It's pointless having four tests in print but only ONE listening test. I think this completely lets down what is otherwise a very useful book. I too would have paid extra to have the complete four practice tests.
2,Not worth it,"This should not be your sole method of prepaing for the IELTS unless you are a strong native english speaker. The book gives you no full idea on what makes a good or bad writing exam and as already mentioned, the listening exam lessons are inadequate. I just took my exam this weekend and this book did not have a significant input into my performance"
1,I didn't get the cd along with the book .,well buying online is always easy but this time it was more than difficult for me .finally I got the book but i didn't get the cd as it suppose to come along with it .
3,Listening modules missing,"The material is great. BUT... I was totally frustrated to find out the CD does NOT include the four listening modules, only the first one! Nowhere in the book or on the site did I find any information about that! Very mileading! Apart from that, the book is very good."
2,Holodeck rules! - Does it?,"The whole book feels like a promotion for Holodeck tool. Some of the chapters are very straightforward: boot your AUT (Application Under Test) from Holodeck and see what happens. However, the version of the tool supplied with the book isn't supported by anybody and, sure enough, it doesn't work with my AUT. The supported one is above $1K for single user licence...Though as much as I appreciate the general ideas about blackbox security testing Whittaker is voicing in this book, I feel it's just not enough there for its price. :("
3,Great looking watch. Dead battery.,"Purchased this watch in July 2010 directly from Amazon as a gift for my son. When it arrived, the battery was DOA. Got a new battery, seems to work just fine. He chose the watch for the dual function - digital and analog, and the blue face. I hope it holds up, and is truly water resistant.Update: Please be aware that this watch does not illuminate (the hands glow in the dark a bit, but if you want to see what time it is after it's been dark awhile, your out of luck.)"
4,Nice,"It's not super fancy, but looks like it to a kid, and that was the point. He really likes it (my 10 year old nephew)"
2,Too dark to see,"One reviewer noted that the watch was darker than the image. I am aware that color can vary from monitor to monitor, so I let it slide. However, when I received the watch, I could not read it in light! The face is actually a metalic blue, creating a glare (image suggests a flat face), and the numbers looked like raised silver, not flat white like the watch image alludes to. This was either photoshopped or taken under special lights, as I was not able to even closely get the watch to be readable like I thought (and I work in photoshop and photography!). Would have LOVED the watch if I could have used it, and it looked SIMILAR to image! Had the face been flat (and not shiny metallic), even darker would have been acceptable."
3,just wished it was luminous,"very lightweight, really hard to notice that you have it on, its pretty smaller and never seems to get caught on anything. So far keeping time very well. It was easy to set and no problems with showering with it.just wish it was luminous, I really cant read it in the dark."
1,Broke case,"This watch broke within 3 days where the pins attach to the case. the case is made of resin that is not strong enough for a sports watch in my opinion. It broke while cycling. I had another identical watch that lasted two months then broke when skiing. I think it's the hand folding"" back"" action while gripping something that did it. My wrist is normal, I'm 5' 7"". Otherwise I like the style and functions."
4,great for what it is,"For the price, this is a great watch. I love having both the analog and the digital read-outs and the alarm function is handy. It is pretty good looking from a distance too.Cons:I dont really like the plastic armband and the plastic dial covering has all sorts of specs and a few scratches. And a light would have been nice.However, you really cant beat the price."
4,Its a good watch as a long as you realize what you'll get,"This is not a bad watch at all, like any Casio watch. It has some pros and cons some of which are stated some arent in the description.pros:-The band is made from very comfortable resin material that you can easily clean if your hand was sweaty-many holes in the band to fit any wrist size. I have thin wrists and this fits me well.-4 selectable beeps for ""top of the hour"" beep, plus alarm clock-the digital screen is positioned well without blocking too much of analog area-settings are very easy to change using 2 buttons, you could lose the manual and figure out how it works easycons:-no ticking hand to show seconds movement-the color is a MUCH darker blue than in the picture, its almost black blue-no illumination for night time-the surface is plastic that will scratch if you accidentally put it in a pocket with keys or something sharp"
5,"Awesome song, good collectors item","This was I think the 3rd single released by Third Eye Blind, and definitely one of thier best. The b-sides are really cool too. Definite must have for any serious 3eb fan!"
5,"PLEASE DON""T LEAVE US, GARY!","I hope that this is not Larson's last addition to the world of syndicated newspaper comedy. His humor is among the wittiest, most drop-dead hilarious stuff on the planet. WHile this may not be his most amazing work, it's still pretty damn funny. If you like this, you'll love his older stuff like the second Gallery. True comedic genious!"
5,i thirst for more larson,"its like a drug. once you read 1 you cant stop. you got to read more and more AND MORE. till you read them all,then it starts slowly you feel unforfilled then you go in to denile""thair has to be more!!!!!!!!!!!"" then anger""i need a (...) FAR SIDE BOOK!!!. then you find more and joy is restored. i just finished Winer Dog Art. now,i am in a state of peril. I NEED A (...)Far Side book. Larson RUN FOR PRESIDENT,you my not no this but you thousands of bystanderdeds who are willing to rise up and carry you to power.i know i would"
2,A Night of Gospel Glory by Paul Simon & Friends,"I was thrilled to finally find a CD version of this performance. I have a VHS version and was hoping to find a good CD version. However, I was disappointed in the quality of the recording. The sound was OK, but the video seemed to be an amateur copy from a used tape."
2,Don't be misled by good story,"David G. Stokes provides a great review. One more point I want to add is not to be misled to network marketing or multi-level marketing by a good story.If you really want to build the pipeline, why not read Ben Graham and Pilllip Fisher's books which lead Warren Buffett to his great success?Security Analysis: The Classic 1951 EditionCommon Stocks and Uncommon Profits and Other Writings (Wiley Investment Classics)"
3,"""Excellent story--been told enough times""","How many more crafty writers are going to capitalize on this topic? This is the same topic as the Richest Man in Babylon, Acres of Diamonds, etc.,etc... The analogy the author used of the worker carrying the bucket of water, compared with the worker building a pipeline to carry the water was great. When the story took a turn to compare e-commerces, I was dispelled. And when the story took even another subtle turn to flaunt another e-commerce provider (Quixtar), even though the name was never mentioned, I was sickened. I guess I can't complain, I borrowed this book knowing the person I borrowed it from was peddling his MLM, Network Marketing, etc., what ever its latest name is. If you can see the good in this book without getting dollar signs in your eyes, then read it."
5,Great Watch,"This is a very good watch, I use the digital time a dual time and I have Athens time on it. I did change the band and placed a leather band, which seems more professional."
3,On Par With The First Two,"After watching Evil Bong 3: The Wrath Of Bong, I have come to the realization that the Evil Bong series is one that if you like one you'll like them all, and if you dislike one you will dislike them all. What I'm getting at is that my opinion for each of the Evil Bong movies is exactly the same. All of them are inconsistently funny, but have enough laughs to warrant a recommendation if you like ""late night comedies"", as netflix labels them. Evil Bong 3 is about an alien bong that transports anyone who smokes from it to another planet. And you guessed it. All of our stupid heroes smoke from it. There is some alien nudity in this one, as well a few Avatar jokes. Just like the first Evil Bongs, the actor who played Gramps is my favorite thing about it. He is hilarious and has lots of colorful insults. Bottom line: If you like Evil Bong and Evil Bong 2, you should see this one. If you didn't, this one won't win you over. It's more of the same."
2,Advertising Supplement,"If you are interested in the university programs that paid to have themselves profiled in this book, then it might have some value to you. Otherwise, there was very little information on the majority of doctoral programs currently being offered in the United States. A big disappointment coming from an agency that would have complete information."
3,Too Few Programs Included,"After paying over twenty dollars for a copy, I wish I could find more information on more AACSB-accredited doctoral programs in this book. Towards the end of the book, there is a list of all such programs. However, detailed information is only available for a small subset. I do not think my money was well spent."
5,An incredible female vocalist,One of the best female vocalists in the world. This album as usual shows just how incredibly good she is. Buy It !! If you've never heard her your really missing out.
4,Tom Adler Delights,"Looking like a cross between Woody Guthrie and ""Father Knows Best"" star Robert Young, Tom Adler is truly home grown and his music defies pigeon-holing. It is quite simply, a delight to the ears. His acoustic melodies exhibit traits of both bluegrass and Appalachian folk music. Sit down and prepare for a treat."
2,Mostly Senile Ramblings,"Most people know Henry Miller from his Tropics & The Rosy Crucifixion. This is a Henry Miller that comes off more as a Paul Harvey type commentator. In the book, Miller pays homage to his bike & some friends of his. Miller wrote this book at an old age, and it sure does show as he keeps rambling on, continually repeating himself, struggling to lift these people & his bike to heroic levels. I enjoyed the section on his bike most of all. I'd really only recommend this title to die-hard Miller fanatics. The casual reader will probably just be bored to death or put to sleep by it. Miller has written much, much better books than this."
4,History book review,The description of this book was accurate. No writing inside but the covers and corners are bent. I am happy with my purchase. It does the job.
5,The Trouble With Angels,"This is a funny, heart-warming movie of life in a Catholic boarding school. It is based on Jane Trahey's experiences as related in her book, LIFE WITH MOTHER SUPERIOR. The sisters in the book are portrayed as positive role models - wise, capable and loving. The students themselves come to appreciate the sisters' dedication and sacrifice as the story progresses. Wonderful family movie!"
5,HAVE TO SEE,This movie is so much fun. It is filled with so much action & stunts by these 2 girls but also the nuns. They are a riot also. The twist in the end is a real tear jerker & also it makes you laugh at the same time. You have to see this movie!
4,"""I'm not a child, Madame - I'm a midget with bad habits!""","What a fun movie! It has been a favorite of mine for many years. Rosalind Russell is superb, as is Hayley Mills. As a child, I loved watching Mills' performances in Disney films, but this non-Disney film remains my favorite. Mary (Mills) and Rachel, her easily-influenced sidekick, seem determined to drive Mother Superior (Russell) insane. The two have a positive GENIUS for trouble, and we see them bluster their way through dance class, marching band, clandestine cigarette smoking, gym class, bra-buying trips, and, consequently, frequent pot-scrubbing assignments. Perhaps the nicest part of the movie is how Mary gains maturity and insight as she learns to appreciate Mother Superior and the other nuns. A truly funny, sweet movie, suitable for the entire family."
2,WIDESCREEN,"It is wonderful that they are bringing out The Trouble with Angels, but it should have been done letterboxed. The problem is , it probably won't be released again. All movies should be released in their original aspect ratio or given the option on the dvd."
3,Please Relesae A Widscreen DVD!.,I first saw the Trouble with Angels on TV in widescreen and I was happy when I read that this delightful movie was finally coming out on DVD but that was until I found out that it wouldn't be in widescreen but instead an edited pan and scan. What a letdown! This movie is funny and delightful and stars Rosalind Russell and Hayley Mills as a nun and student at an all girls Catholic boarding school who clash from the get go as Hayley's character is a real handful! I don't want to have an edited pan and scan DVD so I think I will wait until a widescreen DVD comes out so until than I will just tape The Trouble with Angels from that classic movie channel that always shows the movie in widescreen.
3,"Great Movie, Below Average DVD","I highly recommend this movie. Having a great cast and being directed by Ida Lupino, this film is a real treat. It is really funny in some parts and emotionally heavy in others. For anyone who if now fiftyish in age, this movie will definitely remind you of being a kid in the middle to late 1960s era. That was definitely a simpler time. However, the DVD treatment of this release is very disappointing. Sony Home Entertainment really did this movie wrong with only a full screen release. There are also no special features of any kind. Even a little cast bio section would have been nice, but nothing extra is included. This movie most definitely deserved the theatrical wide screen release format. Given the burgeoning market in wide screen TVs, even in late 2003 when this disc was issued, it is hard to imagine why Sony chose a full screen release. Too bad this movie is not the property of another studio that would give it the respect it deserves."
3,TROUBLE WITH ANGELS - Wide Screen,"It is great to have Trouble with Angels come out in DVD, but why did it not come out in it's original aspect ratio. It is not an inexpensive DVD. It was either filmed in 1.66 which is not much to worry about, but if it was filmed in 1.85 we have lost some of the feel and picture.It definately was not filmed in 1.33, as when the movie starts it states ""made to fit your t.v."" , plus almost every movie after 1953 was letterboxes with exceptions.I hope the movie is released again in letterbox, but it is doubtful since it has already been released."
5,THE TROUBLE WITH ANGLES,I first saw this movie as a teenager and I've loved it ever since. I've watched so many times I don't even need the sound on anymore. I was so glad to see that it was now on DVD. I bought it as soon as the price was right.THANKS AMAZON! I can't wait to share it with my cousins who are the same age I was when I first saw it. I'm sure their going to love it as much as I do. Everyone should have this movie in their collection.
5,Scathingly brilliant,This is a classic and I love it very much! It makes me laugh and makes me cry. Rent it and force everyone in the house to watch it - they'll thank you.
2,What no LetterBox format?,"I adore this movie but i won't buy the DVD until it comes out in letterbox format. Note - it is slightly cheaper at walmart's site but not by much. If I have to suffer thru a full screen version, i might as well continue to view my VHS copy [recorded off of TV]"
5,The Trouble With Angels,This DVD was shipped and received in a very timely manner. It was in perfect shape and it played perfectly in my DVD player. This is one of my favorite comedies and it is not very easy to find. I'm glad I located it on your website while I was doing a little early Christmas shopping. The price was right as well. Thank you.
3,The Trouble with Angels,"My Boyfriend read the book when he was a teenager in Vietnam, one day we were talking about movies and books and he said he would like to know if they made a movie from the book, I searched the internet and found the Dvd in your site, I ordered it for his birtday, he was thrilled when he saw it, we watched the movie together.We really liked it even though a movie will never compare the book.It is a very sweet story, and made us remember about our childhood and how different it was the world in the sixties."
5,"""Hayley's Scathingly Brilliant Idea Ever!""","19-year-old Hayley Mills was now on her way to getting the roles she wanted. In ""The Trouble With Angels"",Hayley plays Mary Clancy,a rambuncious 18-year old who drinks,swears,and smokes. When she meets Rachel Devry(played by June Harding),she says a famous line that will go down in history: ""I got the most scathingly,brilliant idea!"" With that,Mary and Rachel cause a lot of trouble at St. Francis. Mother Superior(Rosalind Rusell) puts a stop to Mary's shenanigans,but Mary does what she wants to.My favorite scene is when Rachel says good-bye to Mary after graduation. Hayley could've gotten a Dramatic Award for her performance. ""The Trouble With Angels"" also made its way for a sequel in 1968:""When Angels Go,Trouble Follows"". Hayley was absent in that one,but the original cast welcomed Stella Stevens as Mary Clancy."
5,THANK YOU,I love this movie almost as much as my mother does and it came just in time before christmas. i am very please with my purchase
3,Lighthearted Entertainment,A very lighthearted film with Hayley Mills and Rosalind Russell playing their parts extremely well . The comedy is well done however the ending is predictable.
3,Better when I was younger,"I remembered this movie being much better, but I saw it when it first came out and the memory is not as good as it once was.The ending is very disappointing. I thought they could've done a lot more with the comedy, but for the time it was pretty funny. Maybe it's the difference between being a kid when I first saw it and being a parent now. There is a lot of good themes and it's definitely worth watching and owning, maybe more so if you are Catholic (which I'm not). I think it's good to have some of these types of movies also just for preserving the look of things and for remembering much less complicated times. And for seeing how far we've fallen.Hayley Mills was fun in most of her movies, and does a good job here too. Rosalind Russell seems born to play a mother superior. The story mostly kept my attention this time, and you could do worse for a family movie."
3,Elizabeth's movie,"I wanted to see this movie because I heard that it was supposedly Elizabeth Smart's favorite. Well, I recieved it in a normal to good time frame and although I did not love the movie, it was pretty good. I hold high morals and the slight offenses in this movie, although not too bad, seemed to bother me a little. There was nothing really that bad, but, like I said, I have very limited tolerance of even the little things in movies and in life. Thank you for the movie though!"
5,Trouble with Angels,"This movie brought back many great memories, especially if you went to an all-girls school. Lots of laughs."
1,"Love the movie, hate the ""pan and scan""","This is one of those unsung, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" movies .. so why is it not offered in widescreen? The ""pan-and-scan"" destroys its original character. Wait to purchase until in comes out in widescreen, but rent it and watch it now! It's wonderful."
3,"Funny movie, DVD could be better","While this movie is funny and always a good watch, I'm somewhat disappointed in the DVD itself. The biggest disappointment is the pan-and-scan only presentation. Whether one has a widescreen TV or not, I've always equated pan-and-scan to butchering a movie, forcing the audience to watch it in a way the director certainly didn't intend. Given the increased technical capabilities of DVDs as opposed to videotape, there's really no excuse for a movie to be presented outside of its original aspect ratio. Also, the picture quality of the movie is somewhat washed out. I've seen the movie look better on cable television."
5,A wonderful Classic,"Rosalind Russell plays a great, empathetic Mother for the Abby. Halley Mills is supurb as a trouble making student at the convent.""I have the most scathing idea"" is one her main quotes.Always into trouble, always getting caught.This movie is funny, spiritual and heartwarming.A must have in anyone's collection of a mid 60's classic."
1,Another dvd hack job,"What a really terrific film that was both comic and reverent at the same time. The sequel Where Angels Go Trouble Follows was equally entertaining and a lot of fun although it would have been better had the ending been different without showing modernism gaining it's hold in the church. The character of Sister George unfortunately was one who did not understand her vocation.Anyway, I jumped at the chance of owning these on dvd but quickly cancelled my order when I discovered these high priced dvds were not released in widescreen. I'm glad to see so many complaining about this and I wish every fan of these movies would boycott the purchase until the studios got the message to give us better quality."
5,My favorite Hayley Mills movie,"Going to a Catholic School I could idenitfy with the girls in Throuble With Angels. I loved Hayley Mills in this movie. I had often wished that I had Mary's personality. I was more like Rachel (June Harding), on the quiet side. I wish the Nuns I had were more like Rosalind Russell (strict but fair). Mary Wicks was perfect in her role also."
4,"This Just In -- ""Bebop"" is a tour de force!","Breakstone is an extremely talented and versatile guitarist playing sometimes in the bebop idiom, sometimes with a gentle and rhythmic sensitivity as well. His lines are inventive, quoting widely from the masters, Gillespie to Strayhorn. His fingerings at times are challenging, in fact, even dare-devil, a la Tal Farlow. This CD contains a mix of tunes, from hard bop standards, such as Gillespie's ""Bebop"" to soft ballads, such as ""Everything I Have is Yours."" ""Bebop"" is a true tour de force - a stunner! His highly esteemed sidemen, Kenny Washington, Sid Simmons, and Dennis Irwin complement Breakstone at every turn. My one complaint is that the guitar sometimes sounds a bit faded."
2,Not useful at all!,"This book is terrible. I lived in Japan for more than a decade and I was planning a short excursion so I bought this book. It was not helpful at all. It covers the greatest hits of Japan but has very little detail about most places. It seems to assume that you'd want to just ride the train all the time without ever getting off. Most of the suggested trips are incredibly unrealistic about the amount of time it would take to visit the listed places, almost to the point of ridiculousness. I do not recommend this book at all! Any other guide book and a rail map would be much better.If you are planning on traveling in Japan, skip ""Japan by Rail"" and get ""Gateway to Japan"" published by Kodansha. It is the best!"
3,A fine guide for planning your tip in Japan,"I find this book useful in planning out a travel iteniary in Japan, especially for those who hold a Rail Pass and would like to see a lot of places. While this books excels in quantity (almost every cities worth visiting is covered), it lacks the in depth description of the attractions in each places. Don't expect things like suggested walking tour maps or any detail of the temples and shrines in Kyoto. You may probably want to consider getting Rough Guide to Japan as a companion to this book.Use Japan by Rail, to plan your trips (there is no other guide book that would give you the direction to storage lockers in a train station!) and bring along Rough Guide as a must have travel companion. Dk Eyewitness is a nice to have if you like illustrations of temples and sites"
2,Japan Rail Book,Getting up to daet information about rail travel anywhere in the world is becoming difficult due to rapid changes throughout the world. This book is good for reference only. If you need something like a train schedule go to the internet.
3,sonja fanatic,"This is an interesting book for Sonja fans. It could have used a little more editing, but it is worth a read."
4,Beautiful Voice,"Love the voice; have been following her since the we heard her duet with Jhonny Mathis (1978 - ""Same Time, Next Year"". Have heard her live, twice. Love the alblum, but wish she would put more new material in each alblum (thta's why it's a 4 and not a 5)."
4,Not my favorite but good,"I love Jane Oliver but for my own taste, was a little disappointed on the choice of songs that were put on this. I wish they would redo some of her other work. I did enjoy this however, as I'm a staunch fan of hers."
1,Worst Ghost Hunting Book EVER!,"This is one of the most worthless ghost hunting books that I've ever read. It only list basic stuff that you can find on any website and never digs into the heart of ghost hunting. It babbles on about spiritualism and doesn't explain how ghost hunts should be done from start to finish. It is vague and incomplete in my opinion. It was a complete waste of money. If readers what to see what a really good ghost hunting book is made of I suggest the check out a book called, ""The Ghost Hunter's Bible."" That book is fantastic!"
5,Excellent Book for Ghost Hunting Techniques!!,"This is a good read. I have read just about all of Troy Taylor's books and this is one of my favorites. It's well-written, organized and very descriptive. I think it should be added to every would-be ghost hunter's library. I would recommend ""Confessions of A Ghost Hunter"" by Troy Taylor as well.Manda Rea, Author of ""Ghost Hunter's Club, Case 1: Elizabeth Sullivan"""
2,Not a Guidebook,"There is to much history, and it shamelessly promotes his tours. If someone wants to learn history about ghost humting it's fine, otherwise it is not a handbook, guide or anything else. It was on the disappointing side. If they spent as much time in informing on current procedures used in ghost hunting as they did history this rating would of been better."
2,Ghosties Afficiado,A highly detailed book of 'what's what' in that fascinating spirit world. A must have for your ghostly collection
3,ghost hunter,This is a great book with the authors point of view through out. Needed broken up a little more to make it easier to read. otherwise ..great!!
1,OH PLEEEEEAAASE!,"This book bites.The author goes on and on about spiritualism and what surrounds ghosts and spirits but never really gets to the meat of the matter. As with other books I have read by this author, the grammar, syntax and organization leaves much to be desired.A big two thumbs DOWN!"
5,It's amazing u gotta read this!,This book has everything u wanna know about ghost hunting. I recommend it for all those people out there who likes the unexplained and the paranormal.ESPECIALLY LIKE ME.
2,book tries hard but accomplishes nothing,"Over the years I have had an avid interest in the paranormal. I have read books by numerous authors, and looked forward to this book being one of the best. I found however a book that seemed to wander as though lost,and the author was searching for a direction to go with it but never quite found it. I have taken my law enforcement training and experience, and coupled it with other books on this subject, and found the scientific methods of investigation to be very similar. I am afraid that this book,apart from the poor spelling, and composition would be confusing to novice investigators, and would give them erroneous information, on a subject that is complicated to begin with. I am sure Mr.Taylor means well, but there are much better books out there for the beginner,or the experienced investigator. The later version is no real improvement either"
2,Poor Design Holds This Book Back,"While the contents of this book are okay, the design makes it seem much worse. I've read desktop publishing that was assembled with more flair. The font choices, margin sizes, photo reproductions - virtually everything design-related in this title is poorly done. Perhaps a future edition can correct these issues but for now don't expect this one to be easy to read. It's extremely hard on the eyes."
3,not bad but room for improvement.,"This book is required reading for newcomers to my paranormal investigation group because it gives a history of the spiritualist movement as well as basic information on most of the tools used in ghost hunting and paranormal investigation. However, the book does have some editing issues and doesn't have much in the way of procedural information for conducting a credible investigation. To my experience there is not a ""total package"" book out on the market. I have not read it but I understand the Ghost Hunter's Bible has more procedural information but is littered with a lot of derogatory comments and unfounded opinions on alterative religions and the use of psychics in this line of work. While relying on psychics for proof is folly in any investigation as far as credibility we have found that they are indispensable. This is a great beginner book but don't expect it to give you all the answers."
2,Not Exactly A Winner,"Although the book covers a few points some new comers would overlook, it is not worth reading more than once. In fact, you can learn much more using the Internet if comparing the amount of ""useful"" information contained in this book.I found this book to be focused more on a ""history"" lesson than actually helping a researcher with the knowledge he or she ""really"" needs. Don't waste your money, try a library first to see why."
4,"A definitive guide on ""Ghost Hunting"" by Troy Taylor","Troy Taylor, founder of the American Ghost Society has created what is considered by many as the definitive textbook for the would be and experienced ""ghost hunter"" alike. Some of the subjects presented are the history of ghost research, investigative technique, investigative equipment, ghost photography, step-by-step ""how to conduct a paranormal investigation"" and even sample forms to adapt for your own investigations.Troy provides a look at many established and discredited theories and provides the reader his own analysis and discussion of each.Many books have been written as 'Guides to Ghost Hunting' but Troy Taylor's ""Ghost Hunter's Guidebook"" is one book the serious paranormal researcher should have if he owns no other."
2,Only for the novice and not very well written,"If you've never done any of this before, you might find it entertaining, but those with any experience will find it dull and too self-promotional. It also isn't very well written. Sorry - I can't recommend another book. Just get out there and do it - find some experienced people and enjoy!"
4,The last page and a half is worth the price,"I didn't think the world needed one more book on the Alamo till I read this one.The first half of the book tells the story of the battle although the battle itself is kind of an anti-climax.The second much more interesting half is the telling of the telling of the story. It explains how people views the story over time. It critques the eyewitness accounts and the diaries and some people selective reading of both.It shows how a Disney movie reminded the whole US of the battle, it shows how an American Icon told the story , it tells the story of JFK trying to avoid a crowd asking a D(aughter of the R(epublic of) T(exas)where the back exit was and was told ""Senator,"" she returned, ""there are no back doors at the Alamo. Only heroes."" And finally it tells the story of the modern attempt to re-write it.Very much worth the money"
5,Continuing praise for A LINE IN THE SAND,"""If you don't have room for the Alamo, we wonder, for what do you have room? The struggle of how the Texan past is remembered forms the divide into which Randy Roberts and James S. Olson jump with A LINE IN THE SAND. And the two do a very good job of negotiating this tricky middle ground by giving all sides and opinions a voice, and letting the reader decide for him- or herself.... [The narrative] is rich in historical and biographical detail and forms one of the strongest accounts I've read of the drive for Texas independence that began in roughly 1820.... the authors serve early notice that theirs will not be a dry history.... Messrs. Roberts and Olson have done a commendable job of showing how ""Remember the Alamo!"" remains as much a battle cry in America today as it was for the Texas revolutionaries who first gave it voice."" --DAN RATHER for THE WALL STREET JOURNAL"
4,Mark does a fine job of it,"Mark has written an excellent book on technical aspects of information protection. For the coverage he provides, he has done an excellent job of explaining things at a technical level suited to students in undergraduate computer science classes or other similar corporate arenas. Well written, nicely done, and well worth the price tag."
3,"Don,t cheat the people","yes i hate the service, because in the book they marked one thing but i received different stuff , so try to cheat people , keep the verdict , you can twist the word , final day every one have to answer to the god ."
1,Do not purchase the Kindle Edition,"Do not purchase the kindle edition of the text book. It costs more and it isn't the most recent edition. It seems like an error, but so far it hasn't been corrected."
4,Good Informative Introduction,"This is a really great and clever introduction on how to make a movie. The interviewer asks succinct questions that are informed and sincere and the directors do what they do so well: tell their gripping stories. This book is well worth your money, though the title did promise to me a slightly more focused book - one that is more about ""Their First Movie"". But allover: Great Read! As a film student and film buff, I'd say check out the book ""The Director's Cut - Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century"" (by Littger) - a book I also reviewed and even favored over this one thanks to being more up-to-date and presenting the diversity of young Hollywood directors today."
3,the product was ok,"because there was no picture on Amazon, I was thinking this was the hard plastic type cover. Unfortunately it is just soft apron type. I have taken the liberty to send it back already. I am sure it is fine if that is what you are looking for, but I wanted the hard plastic shield type.Sorry for any inconvenience, and thank you for checkingDiane Schier"
4,"Not too sweet, Not a very distinctive flavor",A bit over priced and not as flavorful as one would expect a blood orange product. A try once thing as far as I am concerned.
3,not as great as caramel,"This flavor is not as good as the caramel. It is more of a dark chocolate flavor, not so sweet and sometimes I forget about the raspberry while trying to balance the chocolate and sweetness. I use more of it and probably should just add some sugar"
2,dogs and thunder,i bought this on recommendation to help me desensitize my dog to the sounds of a thunder storm. it didnt even phase the dog even at the highest volume. when a real storm came thru he was his usual scarey cat that he is. i am very disappointed.
3,Good Indictment of Fads But Not a Great Alternative,"The first half of the book is an excellent indictment of diets which emphasize either very low fat (Ornish) or high protein/high fat. The authors provide more than enough documentation to make a case that either aren't healthy. Their version of a Mediterranean style diet contains the fruits and vegetables that we need, but also pushes a great deal of olive oil, based on its supposed benefits. I was a little shocked to see a recipe for tuna salad that uses 6 tablespoons of olive oil for 1 small can of tuna. I used half that amount, and it was plenty. The American Heart Assn cautions that the Mediterranean style diet can increase obesity and questions the heavy use of olive oil. I would look at the books by Don Mauer, which are reduced fat but highly edible, as opposed to the recipes in this book."
5,Fantastic program!!,"I have been reading many, many books on diet /health over the years and I must say this book/program is great!Their website offers a weight loss program, but it is more of an education in cooking, shopping for foods/products that will support you and excellent professional advice. I am currently in this program and seeing wonderful results and really friendly, supportive advice. I recommend the book and program highly, there is no magic pill or special combination/exclusion of foods in my mind-just tried and true information combined with excellent, compassionate advice- then get moving, cooking and creating a new life."
5,Fantastic!,This series is absolutely fantastic. The realistic computer generated depictions and background information are extremely educational and entertaining. A must see!
4,It's comedic and fun!,"My husband and I could not take this series seriously because of the overly dramatic narrator and the hilariously written script he read, loaded with deliciously bad puns. That didn't stop us from loving it though. If you want a smattering of history wedged between funny, over the top, dramatic one liners, you'll love this series. I've noticed other reviewers commenting that those who loved the 2012 film will like this and I have to agree. (We found that film comic too!)"
5,Recomended reading for entreprenuers looking to franchise.,This book offers business owners an in-depth look at the issues they may confront while exploring whether or not to franchise their business. Filled with statistics and anecdotes from a leader in the franchise community this book offers tremendous insight and is a worthy read.
3,Alright I guess,"T shirt is a nice colour and nice design, but it is very thin and a bit on the long side as the others said. I bought a medium to see how it would fit, and it was still a bit long. Oh well."
2,Size issues as well,The shirt is pretty big for a LRG. It's almost like a dress on me. I hope it shrinks in the wash.
2,poor sizing,"Black Skull&Wing, is way too big! Even the size small is ridiculously large. I mean, Im 207 pounds at 5'8. I have 17 inch arms! Im a big guy, and this thing looked like a plastic garbage bag over me - its ridiculous. This size small would easily be a XXL in the malls. Enough fabric to make a blanket out of. Not cool"
2,A Lite Jazz Christmas,"This 10 song cd has a bit of everything, but tends to be more modern influenced with a lite-jazz feel to it. That does not mean that it is bad, but don't expect traditional instrumentals. The entire running time is about 40 minutes, which is a bit scant and could have had a few more songs included. Included are the following: Joy to the World, I Wonder as I Wander, Little Drummer Boy, The First Noel, O Holy Night, Bring a Torch, Some Children See Him, Noel Suite, Lo How A Rose, & Jesu Joy of Man's Desiring."
3,Okay - but the pens leak!,"This is a great toy - the kids get so excited discovering what they can uncover next with the pens - but those pens! They leak like crazy, and when you set them down for a minute - the water is on the pages and then you have to wait for them to dry!"
3,"Great idea, Needs improvement","I bought this toy for my son, who loves Thomas. The idea is great, but in no way is this as durable as the original aquamat(which I thought it would be). The white coating to hide the picture until it gets wet, scratches off super easy, and they take what seems like forver to dry. Maybe once they improve it, we'll try it again!!"
5,So soft,"Just the right size for in the crib or in the car. The material is very cuddly. If my son didn't like it, I would have take it."
1,Laborious to watch,Loved the Trouble With Angels. This movie was a far cry from that. The only returning actress is Rosalind Russell. Very few laughs. We kept checking how much time was left because it was so boring. Don't waste your time on this one.
1,THIS SHOULD NOT BE CALLED A SEQUEL,I WAS DISSAPOINTED-SO WAS MY GRAND DAUGHTER-THE MOVIE WAS SLOW/ BORING/THE DIFFERENT GIRLS PLAYING THE PARTS WERE NO ACTORS-I DONT FIND IT IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS TROUBLE WITH ANGELS WHICH IS A GREAT MOVIE
2,I do not recommend this movie,"This movie falls way, way short of it's predecessor, The Trouble With Angels, starring Hayley Mills...buy that one instead!!! It's a case of classic vs. dud...take your pick."
2,This is not as good as the original film.,My granddaughter really enjoyed Hayley Mills in the original film and wanted to see the sequel. She was disappointed that Mills was not in it and it didn't keep her attention. My husband and I watched it and there are so many scenes of the bus and the title song that it is pretty ridiculous. There are a few fun moments though. I remember it being much more enjoyable when I saw it on the big screen. I'd have to say it is a wholesome movie though so more worthwhile that most other stuff out there for kids today.
3,Where Angels Go... Trouble Follows,"This movie is meant as a sequal to ""The Trouble with Angels"" which starred Hayley Mills and Rosalind Russell. Hayley Mills does not appear in this sequal and her absence was a definite detraction. Although many of the other cast members are common to both movies, this sequal is definitely not as well done as its predecessor and comes across as quite ""slap stick"" in its humor."
5,"""Hayley's Scathingly Brilliant Idea!""","In the sequel to ""The Trouble With Angels"",called ""Where Angels Go,Trouble Follows"",Mary and Rachel are at it again,but this time on a field trip. Mother Superior(Rosalind Russell) takes the girls on a field trip,but it's up to the girls on where they should go. Hayley Mills was the only one that was not asked back in the sequel,so Susan Dey from ""The Partridge Family"" took her place playing Mary Clancy. She's got a scathingly brilliant idea!"
3,A Cute Movie That Should Be On DVD!,"I first watched Where Angels Go Trouble Follows on on one of those classic movie channels and it was shown in widescreen too so why is it you can watch this movie on cable TV and the station shows it in widescreen but the DVD gets a lousy pan and scan format? Okay the first movie that starred Hayley Mills is better but this is a cute movie too and I think Stella Stevens, Rosalind Russell and Susan St. James were really good though I agree that it woukd have been nice if Hayley Mills was in this movie too."
1,Pan and scan attrocity,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I anxiously awaited its release on DVD. It looks like I will have to wait a while longer until they decide to give us the movie the way it was meant to be seen....in widescreen.Come on Columbia Home Video, do justice to this and its sister movie ""The Trouble With Angels"" and release them in ""widescreen""!!!! These are such great, vastly underrated movies, it appears even Columbia doesn't think enough of them that they would give them this shabby treatment.If you get a chance to see them (on Turner Classics), they are WONDERFUL movies....but wait to buy the DVD. Don't buy into these pan and scan attrocities that the movie companies seem determined to thrust upon us."
4,Stands on its Own,"Yes, this is officially a sequel to ""The Trouble With Angels""...but only officially. While it does feature Rosiland Russell, Barbara Hunter, Binnie Barnes, and Mary Wikes from the first film, the similarity stops there. Other than The names of the nuns, one student (Marvel-Ann), and theschool, this film has an origional story, and introduces Stella Stevens as a ""modern"" nun who clashes with Russell's Mother Superior.As a whole, this film contains less serious overtones and more comedic elements than its predecessor. If you can watch it from the point of view that it has little relation to the first film, it is worth the effort."
4,where angels go trouble follows,Love this movie! I saw this movie years ago and could not wait to purchage it. I is as good as I remember it. The story line is a feel good movie that tells about two girls in Catholic school and the misadventures that happen to them.
3,Interesting but hard to follow at times,"Shirley Madany has many years of experience in the mission field among Arabic-speaking peoples. In this book she collects correspondence from the several decades of experience helping to run the Hour of Reform (sa3t ul islah) radio program, broadcast throughout the Arab world. The main force behind that show was the prolific Basam Madany, her husband.Strengths are the actual letters themselves. The main weakness is that this book really needs a second edition, one with historical background and context. Many of these letters are from the 80's, but then you have commentary from the present-day, this makes the flow of the book rather hard to follow."
2,Glad I'm finished,"I like others here, tired of this book early. But after reading some of the glowing reviews I persevered and plodded my way through, much like the Great Eastern did. I am relieved that monumental task is behind me now. I wanted to like this book, I really did, but I really don't feel like I know the true motivations of any of the characters in the book, except maybe Spude. What happened to Whitehouse? Why even, was Marx ever mentioned? What drew Trace to love a whore he met in a tunnel?Don't know, don't know, don't know. With all the detail of the cable, I would like to know how much money they made on it. Not a book I would reccommend"
3,Short but Educational,"For people who want to start up their own business, this book is highly recommended. It contains principles to avoid losses and risks. It explains the influences that can affect the stocks. Terminologies are well defined. It has many ideas and information including facts that the stock market is misleading. So you can end in a better decision. It's short but very educational.Mark , author of Hidden Credit Repair Secrets."
5,Best game EVER,"This is probably the best game for any system ever, it looks great especially on the game boy color. Charlie gave me this game and now i cant stop playing, i especially love the diagonal view but birds eye view is excellent also. The versus mode is awesome and the hardest part about the game is wether to decide to go up or head out, there are so many floors to choose from also i cant even describe how awesome it is. A must buy for any fan of portable handheld console strategy puzzle gaming! P.s. the soundtrack ROCKS too."
4,Liked it,"I love Lynsay Sand's historical books and this was no exception. I love how her books have so many twists and turns, besides being funny."
5,Shades of Julie Garwood.,"Lady Kyla Forsythe's sister-in-law, the treacherous Catriona, sends Kyla, and her faithful servant Morag, away without waiting for their recovery from the injuries they've suffered thanks to her. Catriona wants Kyla to marry the murderous MacGregor to keep her away from her home and her injured brother so she can manipulate him.On her way to Scotland, Kyla and Morag are captured by Galen MacDonald and his men. Galen wants to marry Kyla because the MacGregor killed his wife and unborn baby. The Scottish laird wants revenge, but he claimed that the sweetest dish of all was never served cold...Read it. You'll love it."
5,Must Read,This is an excelent book characters are wonderful and well developed. Very well writen and fast pased. A must read for anyone.
3,Entertaining heroine,"I must confess, I read this book about a month ago, but it was so unmemorable that I had to re-read the description and a few reviews prior to recall the storyline. That being said, once I did recall the storyline, I have to say that Kyla ranks right up there with the heroine in Lady Pirate as one of my favorites. If you like sharp, sensible and independent heroines who are quite capable of taking care of themselves, then you'll definitely like her. Galen was your typical rough around the edges man with a secret heart of gold - they're a dime a dozen in most romance novels. Nonetheless, he plays his part well and helps create an entertaining read. Not my favorite Lynsay Sands book, but not terrible."
4,Worth the money,"The dresser looks great. It was a little hard to put together but most prefab furniture pieces are. The only disappointment that I have is the plastic rails for the drawers. They are hard to open and close, but I guess it keeps kids from slamming the doors."
2,A bit tippy...,"I put a Behringer condensor microphone and pop filter on this stand. If I bring the boom down more than 10 degrees from the vertical, it becomes tippy and unstable. I'm going to use a lighter microphone and get a conventional desktop stand for the Behringer."
2,Roots Magic Family Tree Genealogy Software,"Roots Magic Family Tree Genealogy Software, this software did not offer what I was looking for. Too difficult to read a large Genealogy chart clearly. For me it was cumbersome."
2,Not so great...,Wasn't impressed with this software. It's not that intuitive or helpful. We ended up with another brand of software and love it. This one ended up in the trash.
4,Roots Magic 4,"Easy to load, import information, and presents information nicely and without unnecessary glitz. The program does not, or I haven't figured out how to, revise the data into the Roots Magic format. Thus far each entry must be revised individually."
4,Roots Magic genealogy software,"Seems to work fine. Was able to load large pre-existing genealogy file. Some trouble between GEDCOM file codes used by Family Tree Maker, but not recognized by Roots Magic. It will take some hand editing to fix that. Caught by Roots Magic, but another good reason to abandon Family Tree Maker which has tied itself to unacceptible, unwanted, uneeded, Internet connections. Quick delivery of the CD directly from the source company."
3,Try it FIRST,"I have tried several types of genealogy software out, trying to find the right one for me and my projects. And because of this, I have one simple piece of advice to anyone wanting to buy genealogy software, Try it First. I have found that almost all of the descent software companies out there offer either a 30 day free trail or a free version that you can try out and see if it fits your needs, because what might work for me won't for you."
4,Rootsmagic 4,I have just started using this product but I like the way that the screens are laid out as well as the reports and other pages. I like this product. It is very simple to use. I dont think that the extra money spent on FTM with the free time on Ancestry.com is worth it.
5,Superman Tank Kicks Booty!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My wonderful amazing husband ordered this for me for my 25th birthday, as I have recently gotten into Smallville, and its great. wash it on cold, and dry it on tumble dry low, and it never shrank. great thick material, didn't fade and i have washed it three times so far. AWESOME GIFT FOR SUPERMAN/SMALLVILLE FANS!!!"
2,The Necklace and Other Tales,"This book is not up to Modern Library Standards. It contains a meager selection of de Maupassant stories with a rather sophomoric translation into ""American idiom"". Since this idiom is in a constant state of flux, the new translations are often jarring."
1,Just Awful,"This Walmart version of ""GET FIT BASICS"" Pilates System must come packaged with defective cords because no way was mine going to stretch to what I was seeing on the video. Oh and the video was all of 5 minutes, that's it!... with absolutely no introduction to the usage of the cord system whatsoever. The video starts as if you've already missed the beginning and when I tried to rewind it I found that it was already WAS at the beginning. This is a terrible product."
1,"Looking for ""light"" skin flick?","I bought this as a gift from memory or maybe from ""remote"" memory, hee hee. The movie and the story line makes ""no"" sense...really. But if you like Mickey...think he's ""sexy""...than you'd probably like it. I found the second viewing asking myself what did you see in this? Actually felt embarrassed after buying. Was sorry I did so."
1,The dead orchid,"""Wild Orchid"" is an erotic movie starring Mickey Rourke and some other people. Essentially, it's a pornographic movie, another attempt to mainstream porn. Above all, it's a *failed* attempt to mainstream porn. The movie is really bad, and can almost be considered an unintentional parody of pornography. My favourite scene is when Young Woman enters car, and finds Older Woman having sex with Man. She is distressed and asks Rourke to stop them. Rourke responds, in a voice that's supposed to be erotic and passionate: ""I WANT TO, BABY. BUT I CAN'T. I JUST CAN'T"".HA HA HA HA HA.Mickey is a really bad First Lover.Later, the prudish Young Woman and Mickey (who both have sexual inhibitions of some kind) finally ""do it"". The trailer looked promising, but alas, you don't see much...Just as well. I mean, we can't mainstream porn, now can we?PS. I like orchids. The plants, I mean."
2,I really wanted to like this movie ...,"I honestly hoped this would be a good movie, but it was slow, dull, cluttered, and hard to follow. That may sound harsh, but I've watched school board meetings on public access television that were more compelling. Mickey Roarke is definitely a good actor, but seemed uninspired or maybe distracted in this. Carre Otis was also disappointing. I just don't think this role was a good match for her, even though she hadn't really been tested much as an actress before this. Also, if you look at Carre today, she is one of the most beautiful women you could ever see, but she is way, way, way too thin and unhealthy-looking in this film. (Mini-soapbox over the film and modeling industries' distorted expectiations) Yes, maybe she should have eaten more roast beef and mashed potatoes. I wouldn't necessarily recommend you don't rent it or buy it, but know that if you do, it may fall short of your expectations."
3,very sad,"This movie is very sad. I loved ""9 1/2 weeks"" and Wild Orchid is the opposite of that. I can't tell the worst thing in this movie, cause it's a hard question...I hated Mickey Rourke in this role; the movie is boring, and I also didn't recognize my own country in it. The only thing that make's this movie really good was seeing the black woman and black man fully nude having sex."
4,An erotic masterpiece,"Zalman King succeeds at what he does in this film, giving audiences a kinky thrill through masterful building of erotic suspense, exotic locales and beautiful people. We watch things unfold through the perspective of beautiful Carre Otis' character, a rising star in a multinational company who is whisked off to sizzling Rio on her first major assignment.She meets mysterious, brooding Mickey Rourke, who though unfortunately typecast, does a good job at it. Rourke's character teases the sexually naive Otis in often cruel ways, exposing her to sensuality while not delivering himself. Rourke finally wises up to what he has in Otis though, in an erotic climax.Jacqueline Bisset is wonderful as Otis' boss, who also has a fixation with Rourke and manipulates Otis for vicarious thrill-seeking. A pity her character didn't indulge herself. I can always stand to see more of Jackie."
1,Wild Orchaid,"This movie was NOT good at all. Other than it has beautiful people with real nice bodies,everything else is a waste of money and time!"
3,Cool Job in Rio,"Either a female interpreter or a rather sort of an administrator/lawyer is hired to support boss-female bid to get a Rio building contract invested by Chinese high flyers.Mixing sex with work, they reached a goal while a movie looked as a chip porno blue paper, of which male advantages hadn't been dismantled at all."
3,"acting who cares, the music, the locations, the mood","For a first film by Carrie thought she did the best with her talent level, Mickey Rourke was great, by far the music and location are the draw to this movie. It is one that we are putting in our video collection, and one we recommed."
2,Wild Orchid Needs To Be Sprayed With Rourke-Be-Gone (More Otis less Rourke),"Strange film. It starts out with a plot then suddenly there's no plot. Rourke's ego is the size of Texas in this film and it does not help, in fact it hurts the film. Far to much posing and showing the haircut (this doesn't help either). All the Zalman King pictures I've seen take this same ""road"". They seem to start with a plot and then the plot quietly slips away amid steamy sex scenes and sexy music. It's almost as if the director puts in these scenes and hopes that one doesn't notice that the film plot slips away. Carre Otis is breathtakingly beautiful and in fact close-ups of her lovely face and the shots of Brazil are what I enjoy the most about the movie. If I could I would order a copy with 90% of Rourke's scenes taken OUT and replace them with scenes of Carre Otis and Jacqueline Bisset (memories of those great scenes of her in ""The Deep""). I guess you could say that I'm ""Carre""ED away."
2,good once not twice,Watched this movie last week and when it was a new release many years ago. I remember it being much more enjoyable then. My wife was not impressed this time around either. Seemed a bit dated. Still has its good points but cant hold a candle to 9 1/2 weeks for setting the mood.
5,Oh Wow Mickey,What can i say Mickey Rourke is just so great he's an actor i can just look at in Awwww. Carre I didn not like so much the chick sucked.
4,"Well, now.","This one isn't quite mainstream, to say the least. Soft-porn probably would describe it well, but still, I enjoyed it lots, esp the scene in the weird half-abandoned building with the couple making love under a trickling stream of water.Mickey Rourke, fresh from 9 Weeks, again plays a brooding screwed-up millionaire. Lots of kinky sex and titillating background action and dialogue make it fun to watch with someone special. Good sound track, too."
5,Wild Orchid- A Zalman King Classic,"This is a Zalman King classic. The best film out of the trio of films that delt with simular themes. The people are beautiful, the sound track is one of my all time favoriates, and model actress Carrie Otis is easy to look at. Zalman King used influences from Two Moon Junction and 9 1/2 Weeks to provide this fans with a wonderful love story in a wonderful setting. Rumor has it, the film's opening scene had to be re-edited because the motion picture rating board (the pepole that rate motion pictures) gave this film a X-Rating. Rumor also has it that Carrie Otis and Mickey Rourke were actually making love on film. The two later married and then devorced. We can only hope that this hard to find video, and now for the first time on DVD, is the un-cut and un-edited version which has a ""Non-Rating""."
4,Hands on Wild West learning,The book Westward Ho! contained many activities that I used with my students of multiple ages. The activities were well explained and included background information. The variety of activities was broad and included different levels of difficulity.
5,Old-Fashioned -- and Hurrah!,"The tarragon and bergamot give this a ""citrus"" top that smells as rich and golden as a Rembrandt; there's just enough patchouli that it smells ""exotic"" without overpowering you, because it's balanced by the honey note; and the civet and Russian leather give this a smoky, tannic ""cured"" quality that reminds one of the dangerous cafes where Bogie lurked.Quietly male, exotic, and very sexy -- the right thing to wear with a suit when you're spending the evening with a woman who appreciates the finer things in life."
3,The fragrance seemed much lighter than normal.,The product came with a black cap instead of the normal silver. I spoke to a person in the fragrance industry who said this product came from Dubai and the fragrance contained less essential oils and more alcohol. The packaging looked authentic except for the cap.Could this be true?
2,This is not the real deal...,"This is not the real deal! I have been using this cologne, Gentlemen by Givenchy, since 1980. It is the only cologne I use and I know exactly what it smells like. In fact, I still have a bottle of the original cologne that I refuse to use and the product that you are selling is not the real deal. It is extremely disappointing to spend so much money to find out that I have purchased a counterfeit or knock-off product. Check the legitimacy of your distributors to ensure it doesn't tarnish your reputation."
4,Another Grail unearthed,"The missing link between Astrud Gilberto and the Supreme Beings Of Leisure, Weekend arrived just a tad too early (1981) to cash in on the ""lounge"" revival that eventually followed in thier wake. I had searched for years for anything (vinyl or CD) by this band, with no luck until this release. All I had to go on was a mix tape I've had since 1981 (recorded off a Bay Area college radio station) that contained one Weekend song that has become one of my all-time favorites (I never had caught the title, unfortunately). I'm assuming now that that song must be ""The View From Her Room"", the ""missing"" tune on this reissue mentioned by another reviewer. That dissapointment aside, I'm happy to report that the selections that made it to this disc all merit your attention if you enjoy the samba/jazz/pop hybrid style. Imagine a more organic-sounding Swing Out Sister without the lush orchestrations and that nails the Weekend sound. Obscure but worthwhile."
4,La Variete,"A long awaited re-issue of the classic album by the highly influential combo that arose from the ashes of young marble giants. a languid atmosphere created by a mixture of jazz, bossa nova and acoustic guitar pop, all held together by alison statton's endearingly amateurish vocal performance. there is one drawback on this re-release though : the first single ""view from her room"" is conspicuously absent. had it been included (as in the original rough trade cd), it would definitely have been worth 5 stars.."
5,I Absolutely Loved This Story!!!!!!,"I was truly engaged reading about Richard and Nina. I felt so bad for Richard all of the garbage he had to deal with, with his wife's family. Her mother RubyLee was a straight up trip. She took using people to a whole different level. Nina was a really nive kindhearted and caring person whose husband didn't realize what he had until she was gone. I was glad to see Nina working on her relationship with her daughter because it is so true how death could come knocking on your door without you having told the person that you love them or that you are proud of them. This story was well written with a solid ending."
5,Whoaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is an excellent read, and a definite page-turner. It keeps the reader hooked. The ending will shock you. I highly recommend this title for any book lover's collection."
5,great reading,"I read this book in one sitting. I could not put it down. The novel is excellent and true to life. I guess the objective of any good book, is to see yourself in the characters. And that I did. I'll admit I shed more tears than joyous laughter. In any case, I really, really, really like this book. It is an eye opener. And once you've read this novel, you will never forget it! Character development is great. The flow and timing is near perfect. And the conclusion make's you hunger for the next book. Mr.Sewell, keep writing them and i'll keep reading them. Highly recommended."
4,Drama-driven decisions,"Taken For Granted by Earl Sewell is like an [obsession]. Just one page, and you're hooked.Nina is sick and tired of living under her husband's dictatorship. She's grown as a person over the last twenty years of the marriage, and has, in the process, outgrown her domineering husband Jay.Richard didn't know that when he married Estelle he would also be marrying her con-artist mother Rubylee, her irresponible sister Justine, and her niece Keysha. It takes a lot of drama for Richard to see that he's been bamboozled by the quartet.Laced with vivid characters and an emotionally charged plot, this novel grasps any reader looking for an intense love story, an engrossing plot, or just some good old drama. Follow Nina and Richard on their roads to finding themselves, figuring out where their best interests lie, and, most importantly, taking a stand against being taken for granted.~Reviewed by CandaceK"
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK...IT'S WONDERFUL...I WANT TO READ IT AGAIN!,I just finished reading 'Taken For Granted' and it was wonderful. The story line was so fresh and different. There is a beautiful love story brewing in the mist of all the turmoil. I literally could not put the book down. If you take this book to the beach be sure to use extra sunscreen because you will want to stay out there until you finish. All I can say is...when is the next flight to the Bahamas 'cause I need to find my Richard. KUDOS TO MR. SEWELL FOR AN EXCELLENT BOOK!
3,"Nothing special about this book. In comparison to Sake's book, it is definitely much inferior.","As I have stated earlier, this book, is definitely inferior. So, don't waste money on thys book."
2,Don't judge a book by its cover.....,"I've been using AutoCAD since 1992 (Release 10 on a '386 computer with 640 kB of RAM and a then whopping 8 MB hard drive!). Based on the price of this book, the description of its contents, and most of all the picture of the gleaming high-rise building on the front cover I expected a text that would cover architectural drawing in great detail. Instead what I got was essentially a beginners' text with an elementary architectural emphasis. I skipped the first eight chapters of this nineteen-chapter book entirely. Though the information in the rest of the book was a little more more useful, it was nowhere near the level and depth I had expected. I am a very disappointed customer.In conclusion, if you've never used AutoCAD and you are a beginner at architectural drafting, this book may be useful to you. If you don't fall into this narrow category, then you don't need this book."
5,First car speakerphone with no audio complaints from friends and family,"Wow. I love this thing.Long battery life, a clip that doesn't slingshot off my thick Element visor, and great audio on both ends of the call. Great noise-canceling microphone. I listened to a message I left in a pelting rainstorm, and it sounded great. No complaints/knowledge that I'm on a speakerphone when I make calls.Battery literally lasts 10+ days. I do need to power it on and connect to my EnV (LG vx9900) every time I get in the car. (One press of power button, one press of call button.) Otherwise, they do not remain connected.No AC adapter included, so I got a $5 AC to DC adapter from Meritline. Great solution for me since my commute is 20 minutes each way."
3,good sound quality,"I purchased this product as a gift for my father, and he likes it very much. I personally helped him test it, and found the sound quality to be loud and clear while speaking and listening through the device. The display is nice, but it would be nicer if it displayed the caller's name instead of only the phone number. My dad mentioned that his phone (Motorola Razr V3A) does not ""unpair"" with the Tekkeon when he moves out of range, so he has to turn his Bluetooth feature off each time he leaves the car. Otherwise the calls are routed to the Tekkeon, and his cell phone doesn't ring. Since I'm not the owner of the product, however, I can't say for sure whether this reflects a problem with the Tekkeon or with the Razr."
3,tekkeon et 6000 ezspeak,works good except for the voice activated dial. It rarely understands what im asking. but to answer calls no problem.
1,no good,Reviewed this product and thought it was going to be good.I could not get it to work so I sent it back.
3,great on my end...,"it sounds great on my end, but everyone i use it to talk to complains of a very bad echo on their end. Charging and synch'ing were a breeze, but i dont use it very often because im tired of people complaining about it. I am looking at other option... :("
2,not like the picture,"The picture shows a cube with a mirror. That is the same as the one I have and naturally, that is what I expected to receive.Well, it was not.I received a tiny sample cube. I cannot even read the weight because the print is so small. It must be about 1/4 of the size of the one in the picture and there is no lip brush either.Under these circumstances, I feel the lip gloss was very over priced. It does say ""travel size,"" but what the heck does that mean??? Do ordinary lipsticks require luggage or special carrying cases?? Aren't they all ""travel size"" ""fit in my purse size""?? That was very misleading.Bottom line...don't buy it if you think it looks like the picture!!! It is much, much smaller!! Shame on you! You could have snapped a pic of the actual product."
4,Trumbell's 'Library of Alexandria',"This text is an excellent overview of the libraries history of contributions to the human condition. The illustrations are frequent and very lively additions to the work. I did notice two small details that don't fit with my knowledge of Greek history, but they are minor and need not be discussed here. Further, while some introductions function well for adults, this is not such an introduction; the material is really meant for adolescents, and, in this respect, it is wonderful."
1,Not exactly an accurate account,"Unfortunately, the many illustrations within this book attempt to bolster what is otherwise untrue about the Library and about the Greeks because any alleged account of Greek Philosophy is remiss that fails to mention first and foremost, that The Egyptians taught the Greeks any knowledge that they knew of the Arts & Sciences. Moreover, it's very unlikely from reading this book that any one Greek philosopher (such as Aristotle for example) could have produced so much diverse written science from diverse subjects and all in one lifetime. It is also very unlikely that the Greeks were actual authors of the Library contents. This is obvious as well because the Egyptian Mystery Neophytes were prohibited from writing or speaking about their education (hence the term 'Mysteries'). So, unfortunately, I think that this book is a gross exaggeration of Greek history, Greek authorship and in numerous ways, is not the best account of the Library's true history."
1,Daewoo customer service is awful,I was very happy and content with my purchase until the pixels went bad in the TV and had to deal with their warranty department. They work with 2 local repair shops in our area (central FL very large area). After being referred to several shops who were doing work and being told they don't work with Daewoo anymore I should have know then that this would be an ordeal. 7 weeks later 5 without the TV I still can't get a simple question answered. When will my replacement TV be delivered. I have worked with other manufaturer's before with defective products and have never experienced the things I have with Daewoo. DON'T BUY DAEWOO.
2,Limited Warranty,"I have had the DTS-42 for about 2 months now. It has been a good t.v until the last several days. I have a small horozontal yellow line in the t.v on the left side. I called 800-Daewoo and they gave me a service center in my area that did not exist, and the phone number was wrong. Their web doesn't give any service addresses in my area at all. Still waiting for a reply from e-mail. Good t.v if it doesn't break. If it breaks, good luck. Spend the extra money for reassurance."
1,terrible,"within 14-15 months of purchase, i developed a pixel line. Daewoo noted that while this was a rare occurrence, especially for such a new set, the warranty was the warranty, and it was out of warranty (warranty period was one year). They would fix it for $500, but only warranty it for 30 days following repair. After two more months I had over 25 of these ""rare"" pixel lines. I finally gave in and sent it in. Now, 31 days into the 30 warranty period, the power turns off within seconds. (the unit is on an expensive surge protector, which itself is on a whole-house surge protector, and no other equipment not bearing the name ""Daewoo"" is malfunctioning. I will not buy again."
1,Decent TV with awful service! Stay away from Daewoo junk!,"I got this TV from CompUSA when it was on sale. A couple of good points:Picture looks decent with standard cable. On some channels, football looks 'wierd', when the players are standing still, they are blurry/pixeled? But otherwise, a decent picture.Speakers actually sounds decent, even though they are listed as 5 watts!But I'm on my 3rd TV, and I was supposed to get this one replaced too, but Daewoo service has stopped returning my calls. They all had the same problem: a vertical or horizontal line appears in the screen. One of the replacements had the lines when I recieved it, and it was a refurbished unit, so I guess it was never fixed right to begin with.Now the unit is no longer under warranty, and Daewoo refuses to fix it. When I asked for a manager to call me back, they never do.I guess I should have bought the extended warranty from CompUSA. 14 months after purchase and I'm stuck with broken TV number 3. Thanks Daewoo!"
1,GARBAGE,"I shouldn't even give this item one star. Don't buy it. Avoid Daewoo like the plague that this company is. They manufacture GARBAGE and should be BANNED from the shores of North America.This DTS42 developed red horizontal lines less than two years after a very expensive purchase. Daewoo refused to repair it, unless they could sucker me out of another $500.No thanks. I'm not one of those P.T. Barnum types who is born every minute. My money stays in my wallet. Daewoo manufactures GARBAGE. Avoid all Daewoo products, if at all possible."
4,Pete Rock & CL Smooth,"This is a very enjoyable hip-hop album that was a breath of fresh air when it sppeared. Although it lacks a super-duper classic tune, it is strong on 90 percent of the songs. The only problem for the artists who recorded the album is, it is so good, there isn't anything else to say at the end. How can Pete Rock and CL Smooth do any better? This is their 'Invisible Man' so it did not shock me that they did not record much after the release of this gem. CL Smooth appears to improvise at times on this album and doesn't sound rehearsed (much rap does). Pete Rock's beats are superb. Don't waste your money on sex rap or crime rap; get this one, and learn."
4,At first I thought it was boring,"When i first heard it I was kinda dissapointed, the lyrics where on point, but I just thought the beats where boring. So for about 3 weeks i didn't bother to listen to it. But when I did listen to it I loved it. It has this nice kinda 60's rnb type feel, the album only suffers from a few stale beats but Pete Rock certainly makes up for it with tracks like: ""for pete's Sake"" and ""straighten it out"". This album isn't a 4 it's a 4.5."
3,They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.) that's all I have to say!!!!!,"Now I finally got my hand's on this cd and it's ok but the song that put these 2 on the map was the song ""They Reminisce Over you (T.R.O.Y.)"". It was a song dedicated to one of Heavy D's dancer's name Trouble T-Roy. He died and this was the song that Pete Rock and C.L.Smooth put together and it was the only jam I played the most. Now there 2nd cd The Main Ingredient was and is there best cd. I suggest anyone who love hip hop get this you won't be madd."
5,ANOTHER CLASSIC FROM EARLY 90'S,"THIS IS A EXCELLENT ALBUM FROM START 2 FINISH WITH PETE ROCKS 70'S STYLE LAID BACK BEATS AND CL SMOOTHS SMOOTH RHYMES THIS IS A GR8 CD SO BUY THIS NOW, BEST TRACKS TROY, RETURN OF THE MECCA, WIG OUT, ANGER IN THE NATION, BASICALLY THE HOLE ALBUM FUCIN RULEZ DOGF SO BUY IT OR U MISIN OUT OF SUMTING GR8"
5,Classic this was when hip-hop was about story telling,"This album took me back to days when life was simple, you cant go wrong with this album, if you are a Pete Rock fan I recommend not just this album but the others as well but always go for the debuts and this one is a definitely classic. DONT SLIP!"
5,Classic Pete Rock style!!,"Best Pete Rock album to date. ""They Reminisce Over You"" will go down as one of my favorite rap songs of all time. Purchased the album over 6 years ago and it continues to be played consistently."
5,Musical Perfection,"This album is not only tasteful, it's irresistible. Pete Rock's jazzy and soulful production style is clearly evident while CL Smooth's flow is at its absolute peak. Released in 1992, this 73 minute masterpiece fails to disappoint any open-minded listener. When you cop this album (and I strongly suggest you do), be warned. It might never leave the player."
5,An American Classic.,I've finally replaced my old tape cassette of this album... because this really belongs in everyone's library. Pete Rock still sounds great.
5,Excellent Battery Tender,"This is my second Yuasa Smartshot Charger. The first one is 5 years old, and still in service. I use it to keep my camper battery topped off. Now that I have added a motorcycle to my stable of vehicles, I'm in need of a second battery maintainer. I thought about getting a less expensive ""Battery Tender Junior"" device, but my Yuasa has been reliable for many years, so I just stuck with what I know works.This unit is well built and rugged. It has been dropped several times (accidentally, of course) and it still looks and works perfect. The LEDs are well labelled, and easy to read. It's also nice that it comes with a couple different connection options as well."
5,must have for keeping motorcycle batterys in top shape,"My bike came with a Yuasa battery and I""ve heard good things about Yuasa. So why not buy a charger from the same company that makes your batter??Its nice to have the two types of batter connectors. I mount the hard-wire kit to my motorcycle and whenever it will sit for a while, i can charge the battery without needing to take off the seat, etc to get to the batter. Then you also have the alligator clips to use when you need to charge other batteries like lawn equipment."
5,Bikerider,"This charger maintains my battery perfectly. I bought an extra battery connector cable and rotate the charge once.every week or so and it keeps my hundred dollar batteries perfectly charged, extending rheir life as well."
5,a sensible purchase,"Works fine. I should use it more often, esp. for little used batteries like lawn tractor and other's. Should help keep batteries ""alive""."
5,#1 item,"this item does the job great. we keep our chargers on motorcycles, atv, mowers and tractor. never have to worry about dead batteries.l"
3,Microsoft for Dummies,"It was of some help, but I thought it would show me step by step how to do a publication. You have to leave one chapter and go to another to get all the directions to set up your publication. Not quite written as simply as they say. I guess I'm a little dumber than your regular dummie!"
1,Publisher for Dummies,This book is not worth the money. We wanted actual lessons and this doesn't fot the bill. I will be returning them.
1,Not impressed,"Too unbelievable, predictable and silly. No household of the era would have tolerated Anyas behaviour. The islanders would not have made it to the houselhold nor been welcomed there. Purchased husbands were not the type of men to be kind. Seriously flawed."
2,DeButy and the Beast,Plot was unable to hold interest. The characters were too extreme to be believable. Did not finish the book because it was not worth the time.
3,You get what you pay for,"the quality is not bad. The top is made out of nylon, the bottom is made from tarp like material. The main problem I see is the pole support system. The tent has holes on top for the poles. The part of the pole that goes there is made out of plastic- fragile in my opinion. On the bottom there is no special space for the poles to go. You just have to put them on the floor of the tent- might damage the floor material from the pressure. Th"
5,Awsome. but a little small,"I took this tent with me to the 2009 military games, it did a great job. it was windy as all hell it stayed up and nothing broke. i am happy with my buy and if i ever need a new one i just might get another one of these. :)"
3,"cheap tent, get what you pay for","So this tent is very old school. It's like the kinda tent you see in the Brady Bunch when they go camping. It takes a lot of balancing to get the poles to stand up right and even then its pretty unstable. Granted we did set it up in sand, I think that with some extra usage of nylon rope you could get it to become really sturdy. It's not really waterproof though. Honestly if you're gonna be camping a lot and in different climates just spend more and get one with an actual frame."
1,Terrible Product,"I've used it on 2 separate camping trips, and both times I woke up in the middle of the night to a drenched sleeping bag. The reason for that is not the rain (which never came down) but the lack of proper ventilation. It's very light and portable but I'd rather sleep under a tree than in this terrible product.I would not recommend this to anyone!"
4,Classic work of Upton Sinclair - FREE ON KINDLE,"Books are classic for a reason.I was thrilled to be able to download the Upton Sinclair collections, and I am slowly getting to each of the books.The books were referred to in some of the modern science books I read. That alone made me curious.I am sure there are professional reviewers out there who have already said what needed to be said in their reviews for all of Upton Sinclair's works. I won't even attempt a review of the novel's content.I just love that it was free and available to me, a Kindle user."
2,So So,"This book condensed all the info and did make it easier to understand, but I took the test and it is much more in depth than the book. I would say it covers about 60% of what's on the real test. You need a supplement to get more detailed info on new rules. Save your money and get something else."
2,book barely gets passing grade,"I wish I could recommend this book because it is easy to read and made studying fun, but unfortunately most of the exam questions were not covered in this book. I took the test yesterday and passed with a 70%, the bare minimum.Approximately 40% of the questions were covered in this book and on the remaining 60% I had to guess. Since I could narrow most guesses down to 2 possibilities, I was able to squeeze out a 70% and pass.Maybe there's something out there that will better prepare you..don't know. If you do get this book I would definitely use a supplemental study resource. By itself, it isn't enough unless you're a good guesser or lucky like I was."
2,Series 63,I would not recommend this for passing the Series 63. I read the book and did their on line practice testing. I was at 85% when I took the state test. I did not pass.
1,Bad study guide,"I found this book to be a terrible study guide. The book filled with useless jokes, material is not explained properly, the practice test do not explain the answers, it just makes some bad jokes about the answers. The book is poorly organized and the glossary is terrible. I have passed the 6,7 and the CFA exams using other study guides, but I would never recommend the guide to anyone."
1,There are much better books out there,I found many typos and incorrect information in this book. It is not up to date and the test questions do not resemble the real test at all. I failed on my first attempt after studying this book. My firm gave me a book from another company and I scored a 94 on the test. Save your money for a good book.
4,Great addition to study materials,"This book was a great addition to the study materials given to me by my employer. The material was easy to understand, well laid out and not nearly as boring as every other Series 63 book I read."
4,I lked this book helped me pass,"I studied with 2 books and this was one of them. To be honest I failed the 63 the first time by one wrong answer, so I go this book to help me pass. Passed on my second attempt and I will say that this book helped to clear up some very ambiguous language in my other book. From experience if you have a very technical boring book with crap examples get this book. If I had this book the first time I would have passed for sure. I over thought the test the first time, however after reading this book it broke it down into simple concepts and examples. I would underline what I thought was important in each chapter, type up my notes, study and do the tests, passed with an 80. I would recommend this book to anyone studying for the 63. As a tip don't over think the test just pick what makes most sense."
5,Essential Preparation for S63!,"I couldn't be happier with this material. I knew nothing about the Series 63 course material, and this is the only book I used to prepare for the exam. I read through it and took all four practice exams, and by the time I had finished doing that the actual 63 exam was a breeze. Great book, highly recommended!"
3,Author's style may or may not work for you.,"The good news: I used this book as one of my study resources and subsequently passed the test. The bad news: I found the author's humorous/conversational style to be frustrating. The author purposely adopted an informal and frequently sarcastic tone to put the reader at ease as he/she studies the arcane Uniform Securities Act. After all, it is a puzzling and occasionally absurd body of regulation. However, in his long, discursive paragraphs, the author does not do a good job of cutting through the clutter and focusing on the key facts, lists and principles that need to be MEMORIZED in order to pass this test. I would recommend supplementing this book with the Solomon Prep/Ken Clark study guide, which takes a more structured approach to outlining the Series 63 material."
2,could be better,"I put this on a floor tom, and it held well a few times, but the plastic gripper thing slides off the hoop now. It seems to be at the wrong angle."
1,Breaking apart after 1 use.,"Started breaking apart after one use. Stripping out, falling apart, doesn't fit easily around hoop, and doesn't look like the one pictured."
3,Great clip but....,"I bought 3 of these clips and after two years of studio use they have lost their grip. The clips clamp tight onto the rim with a small rubber clamp. Over time the rubber has fallen apart and can no longer grip the drum rim. Sad... the clips are very nice, made of metal and have shock absorption but without replacement rubber grips I would look for something that will have a harder time deteriorating so quickly."
2,so so at best,"Though there are plenty of images, they are bad in quality, very grainy- even hard to see. I was disappointed I bought this.... though the information is quite good. A mixed bag."
1,Do Not Buy for Use With a Mac,"I will be returning this product. It will not work as a boot drive for a Mac or under Unix. It took several unanswered emails to Western Digital's ""customer service"" and finally an excruciatingly long hold time to actually get a Western Digital technical support person via telephone support to learn that Western Digital, company-wide, does not support this use for their external hard drives. There is no indication of this shortfall anywhere on Western Digital's website (including tech support knowledgebase articles) or Amazon's site. Mac users be forewarned: This manufacturer could care less about you."
1,Buyer beware,"donpaolino's experience parallels mine exactly if you collapse the time frame: I'm on my fourth replacement drive within six months. Technical support is not so good--their only solution was to keep sending me replacement drives. An unreliable device, a depressing experience. Don't buy this drive."
1,It's like some horrible parody.,"This is the biggest Sailor Moon/Tenchi Muyo/Pretty Sammy/Wedding Peach/Sailor V, etc, rip-off I've ever seen.I'll give any non-hentai anime a chance, so I watched the whole thing, hopping it would improve, meanwhile writing down a 2 paged list of obvious rip-offs, for example a blonde heroine who looks like Minako who wants to befriend the enemy, a masked hero who throws roses, a girl who looks like Sasami, a woman who looks like Urd wearing Tsunami's cloak, a food obsessed girl with a cat, & a sceen disturbingly familiar to when Prince Dimando dies.Even if I had never seen the other series I mentioned, this is still a annoying series. It's the first thing I ever watched that truely made me want to loose my lunch."
5,Great Material on Family Law Mediation,"As an attorney all you hear about nowadays is ""mediation"" and ""ADR"". You're expected to settle things out of court because everything is so backed up (and expensive) but when I went to law school they didn't teach negotiation, how to settle cases, or about non-court alternatives. I picked up this DVD series so that I could educate myself about what the mediation process actually entails so that I could explain the pros and cons to clients. In addition, there was a nice section on negotiations and how to break impasses as well as how to deal with difficult people. Since those are things that I do every day, that was a nice bonus in addition to just the ABC's of mediation. I saw this speaker present at the American Bar Association conference a couple of years back so I figured that this would be a quality program, and I was right."
5,Great material,Diana has prepared an excellent set of DVDs. Easy to follow and well worth the investment. The DVDs take you through the different areas of law and address the mediation issues.
5,Very instructive and informative.,"I've been thinking about becoming a mediator but all the live courses are really expensive and time consuming, so I ordered this set to see what mediation is all about. The DVDs really covered everything thoroughly and I learned a lot about mediation, how to be a mediator, and how to run a practice. I was able to do it on my own time, too, after work, instead of having to take an entire week off to attend a traditional 40 hour training. The instructor is really knowledgeable and clear. It was an interesting program. The companion manual is good, too."
5,Great training on divorce mediation!,"This was a really helpful and informative training on all aspects of divorce mediation. The trainer is interesting and engaging which is not always the case with video trainings I have seen! The instructor is also great about explaining how she runs her mediation practice from beginning to end. She talks about how to set up an office and explain the mediation process to prospective clients, through to the written agreement at the end. Also, I really like having the DVDs as a resource to go back to, which I know I will do with these."
5,Cheap and Entertaining,My 3 year old is extremely hyper. She runs around the house from the time she gets up in the morning until she goes to bed at night. We got her these as a stocking stuffer for Christmas and they are her favorite thing. She will sit for hours coloring on these mats. She can color out the whole princess and by the time she's done it starts to disappear and she wants to do it again. Quite impressive.
3,Great for traveling,This aqua-doodle is durable and small. It is great to use while traveling. There is no mess. My daughter loves it.
5,Your Little Princess with Love This!,"Just fill the leak/spill-proof pen with water and watch the colors appear like magic on the fun and eye-catching coloring mat. With favorites like Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, these Disney mats will keep your little one entertained for a while; grab one for car trips, Grandma & Grandpa's house, we even keep the mini version in tow for restaurants. The mats are durable and you'll be surprised at how crisp and bright the colors are even after repeated use and drying off for re-use. Several different themes are avialable including Winnie the Pooh and Thomas the Tank Engine, along with Sesame Street/Elmo varieties. Get a few to keep the selection fresh for your kids since these are great playdate activities too! This is a value priced activity with NO MESS!"
5,A Beautifully Lucid and Poetic Exposition.,"This is one of the most beautiful and profound academic books I have read in ten years of Religious Studies (and I am an Indologist). Sufism's interpretation of one of my favourite literary characters, Iblis or Satan, is rational, lucid, poetic and ultimately beautiful. I am moved by Iblis' perennial love for God and his hatred of Adam. The mythology, philosophy, and internal logic is both thought provoking and aestheticly quickening. Awn has sympathetically presented Sufism's enlightened theology on a figure much maligned by the mainstream Semitic traditions. He is to be very much congratulated!"
4,In-house printing?,"Probably everyone knows this but me, but this appears to be a nicely-bound copy of the original. I guess that's what the NatGeo - looking cover art means. It is an oversized paperback, and the content and quality seem unchanged. If this is an option to not being able to get the book at all, I'm fine with it."
2,Texsport cabana,"This product needs stiffer poles or a change in construction so that the slightest breeze does not blow it over. I was very disappointed in this product. The folks at Texsport need to do a little more work, Great idea, just made to cheap."
2,Doesn't Fit the recommended Granite Ware 13 inch Oval Roaster,"I had to return this product even though it was recommended by Amazon to fit inside the Granite Ware 13 inch covered oval roasting pan. The rack is too wide and doesn't even clear the edge of the roasting pan. However, Harold Imports makes a 10 x 6 Inch roasting rack that fits perfectly inside which I was able to exchange this one for."
4,Good rack,"It seems to work good but it should be a little higher.It will drain the grease out,so it will do the job.It depends on how much grease you have?"
1,oval roasting rack,"Horrible, I could have purchased this item from the dollar store! It is thin and does not look like the product on the website!"
3,Very low height,No real big downside except for how short it is. It's sturdy enough for large roasts and appears decent for a bit of time and use but it's so shallow you need to empty dripping frequently if you don't want them soaking the underside of your roast.
3,Oval Roasting Rack was too large but well worth the price,Product was too large to fit inside my slow cookerbut seemed to be made of quality craftsmanship.Oval Roasting Rack was too large for what I needed but well worth the price .
5,It's a roasting rack,It elevates my roast quite beautifully. lol What can I say?! It's a roast rack.
5,I'm very pleased,"I had a Kodak EasyShare C633 however, it was stolen. I love this camera as it has some really great features. One of my favorite features is the ability to view your pictures/video on T.V. I was hesitant about buying a refurbished one but I took a chance and it paid off. The camera came with all the accessories and two manuals in the event I lose one. And it was in Excellent condition. YEAH! Will I order from Amazon again? You Bet!!"
2,Nice camera if it lasted,I purchased this camera for a trip I was taking. Worked great on the trip and the few more times after that. Been about 13 months and now it won't even turn on. The software also is not user friendly. Of course the warranty is only good for a year. I'm a bit disappointed in Kodak. I won't buy a kodak camera again.
3,A good beginner Camera,This was my first digital camera. It stood up well to two children. But after about a year started having some issues when i took pics outside. In the end i bought a canon..But this is a good little camera for the price.
5,Love it,"I grew up listening to this CD, so of course listening to it about 10 years later will bring good memories. I adore it! Although I'll never click the ""buy with 1 click"" before it's a rip off shipping wise."
2,Not Reliable Long Term,I installed this rotor in October 2004. It was only used occasionally. In 2007 it started sticking and froze up completely in 2008. Long term reliability seems poor.
1,VERY undependable,"Have had this for a couple of years and it has not worked more than two or three times. Have had the retailer come back and ""fix"" it but only works for a day or so and then quits again. If you have a need for an antenna rotor, THIS IS NOT THE ONE TO BUY. A total waste of money and will not operate properly."
2,9521A,My 9521A loses 9 degrees in just 180 degrees of rotation.... But thats not the main issue with this style of rotor... If you buy one of these rotors from any of the companies the absolute FIRST thing you do is take off the little black weather boot and completely fill the groove up with a good silicone sealer.... reinstal and run another 1/4 inch bead around top of boot to completely seal it. My experiance with this was learned the hard way... If you do not do this you can rest assured that after 2 hard rains and 30 days the little cheap bearing and gears in these units will rust solid and all your efforts will have been for naught!!!!
1,Absolute JUNK!,"Unable to climb, paid someone a handsome price to eave mount an antenna and this rotor 25 feet up. I pre-assembled and tested the rotor/antenna for about 10 days - worked fine.Though it needed re-synching about every week (a typical week included about 4 short rotations), the rotor worked fine for 121 days when it got stuck at due North. And it won't budge.Now it's out of warranty and I have to pay for: a new rotor and an antenna installer to take down the entire system, re-assemble and re-mount.This phrase applies, ""Sometimes cheap stuff is expensive to buy.""Give this dog of a piece of Chinese, plastic-geared junk a wide passadena."
2,Channel Master 9521A Antenna Rotator is Junk,"My newly installed 9521A Antenna Rotator made a rotation of 180 degrees before it quit. I reinstalled my 30 year old Channel Master rotator and controller which still works, but I thought it prudent to replace it when installing a new antenna. The bottom line is that new isn't always better. I'll be looking for a new rotator that has a few more turns in it than this piece of junk.Ron."
2,Another CHINA made product!,The cm9521a rotator would only turn 180 degrees when first installed. After repeated tries it finally turned about 240 degrees. On the third day of use it completely quit. If you install the cm9521a be sure to check rotation before placing on a 40ft tower as this can get expensive in a hurry! I returned the rotor but it will take up to 8 weeks to recieve my refund. I'll let you know how it turns out. This is another American product that is made in CHINA...
3,Digital World Now,This is great if you have many TV broadcasting stations originating from different locations. I live in Austin and all stations come from the same area since everything is digital now. I really don't use the antenna motor any more. Digital stations do not transmit as far so I can't get other nearby cities. The remote control logic for this system is not very good. It is very difficult to operate for a device that should be quite simple. Mechanically it seems to be ok.
1,Nothing like the book!,"Yet again, the film making industry has utterly demolished a great story! Read the book. It's a great family book about the Bastable family, and the children do have many adventures attempting to ""restore the fallen fortunes of the House of Bastable"", but they do not do it by lying or constantly fighting. They learn a lesson with each adventure instead.This movie production, however, deviates so far from the book as to be ludicrous. Instead of the father being a businessman ruined by grief, he is an incompetent absent-minded inventor. The children lie. The children are disrespectful of authority. The oldest character, Dora shows teenage angst that never appeared in the book. The minor character of the authoress is turned into a feminist doctor. Why did they have to take the values of the Victorian family out and make a movie about today's societal problems?"
3,A Slight Shadow of the Book,"It wasn't a terrible movie, in fact parts of it where amusing. But having read all three of the books in the Treasure Seekers' series (The Treasure Seekers, The Wouldbegoods, The Return of the Treasure Seekers) I can attest that the movie just isn't the same. The father is turned into an inventor, trying to sell his refrigeration device and save his family financially. Dick does not exist, neither does the Indian uncle. Dora is portrayed as being almost sixteen and even Oswald may have been cast to old. The three youngest siblings are alright though. Eliza, the made is simply huge and does a good job as well. One of things that made the books funny was the naration of Oswald, this element is also lost in the movie. So go ahead and watch it, but read the books to get the real E. Nesbit."
5,This is the one you want,"I bought this for my son, and he's been using it for more than a year. He chose the BDC reticle over the mildot, and he isn't disappointed in his choice. I would personally have chosen the mildot. However, the unit performs exactly as expected based on Nikon's description. This scope works extremely well at dawn and dusk, and can be used during a full moon at night (yes, only for pigs and coyotes). Controls are easy to use, it accepts standard sized accessories (e.g. spring loaded lens covers), and the lifetime warranty is an extremely comforting component. Absolutely no buyer's remorse."
5,Best scope I've ever used,"Mounted this on my .223 savage 12 and was absolutely astonished by the accuracy and clarity, I'm thinking of buying one for my 30-06 but I don't know how well this scope can handle recoil. Buy this and you won't be disappointed."
4,Fun Music,We saw the movie and my 4 year old daughter had to have the cd with the Move It song. Its a fun cd that I really enjoy listening to as well.The kids love it and I put it on when we have parties too!
5,move it,My kids and grands loved this movie. It was entertaining and the music was great. will be a pass along
3,Better to buy individual tracks than the whole album,"Of everything included in this album, I love the Hans Zimmer music, Born Free, the best, and his only other piece, Beacon of Liberty, second best. I was disappointed to discover that the whole album is not his music.The album lists Zoosters Breakout as created by ""Various Artists."" It is my third favorite piece and is quite zippy and fun to listen to.Other than the track, Best Friends, also listed as by ""Various Artists,"" the rest of the music is not originally created for this movie. There are some time-tested, excellent pieces of music included, but their prime appeal is in how they are applied to the movie itself rather than listening to them separately--at least for me personally."
2,Let customers buy what they want!,"Most people probably want to buy ""I like to move it, move it"" from this soundtrack, or maybe another track or two with it. Amazon and the record company seem to know this, because they clearly force you to buy the entire album of otherwise unimpressive music in order to get the one or two tracks you really want. Amazon, you could've sold music iTunes didn't, since iTunes doesn't even offer the full album, but instead you make a similar mistake. I don't approve of stealing music through pirating it, but this is the sort of business decision that encourages people to file share or rip from their friends. Why not make some money selling the tracks people want, instead of discouraging them by forcing customers to buy an entire album to get one song?"
4,love it,"We bought this movie for our [...] after our babysitter let him watch it and he loved it. I had some reservations because it was PG-13, but after some lengthy discussions with our [...] about NOT acting out the parts when the penguins are a little naughty, it's been fine. He loves the characters and I'll catch him ""running the lines"" sometimes when he's playing by himself. The nice part is that my husband and I enjoy watching it too and we listen to the soundtrack in the car as well!"
3,All for One Song,"As a compilation it really doesn't flow very well. I must confess - I bought it for only one song. To watch my 4-year-old dance to ""Move It Move It"" is worth every penny and more!"
4,"Madagascar, Original Soundtrack Review","I liked the CD. It contained some 'classics' like ""Stayin' Alive"" and ""Chariots of Fire"" and Erick Morillo's, ""I like to move it"" is the original version of the song and not one found on any of the mixes from Madagascar 5. I've given it a 4 star rating, and any music you hear on the film is going to be in here."
3,Not all the songs from the movie!,"I have not seen the entire movie---yet, but I'm getting there. The point is, that I haven't seen one review here that talks about the absence of the great song ""Candy Man"" by Sammy Davis, Jr. You would have thought that if this was the soundtrack to the movie, it would have ALL the songs from the movie. But it just isn't so. Sure, the songs that are listed are fine, but why isn't ALL the songs from the movie on the soundtrack? I think they should go back to the studio and remake the CD's to include ALL the songs from the movie, because if they don't, they really shouldn't call this the soundtrack. Come on, go back into the studio and remake this CD!"
2,Greed Will Cost the Record Company Money!!,"Like virtually everyone who saw the movie, I came out humming ""I Like To Move It,"" as did my seven year old son. But when I went to itunes to try to download the song, I discovered that you had to buy the entire album to get that song!! Since I had most of the other songs, and the album was only 31 minutes long, I passed. I borrowed the CD from the library and got the song I was after. This way, the greedy record company won't get one dime from me! First off, the soundtrack should have included some of the hilarious penguin dialogue, thus making the album longer. The individual songs should have been available on itunes. If the record company had done that, every parent in America would have downloaded ""I Like To Move It,"" generating some serious revenue for the record company. But no, they had to get greedy and shoot themselves in the foot, once again. When will these corporate shills learn to give people what they want?"
1,Soundrack itunes - not the movie - movie get's 5 stars,"Oh, stop whining ... they're pretty smart in one sense. They knew they had a good thing with ""I Like to Move It."" Do I like it? No. Do I understand it? Sure. There are plenty of schmoes who will impulse buy and pay the whole thing.Me? I plan on buying it later when the price goes down. To e-bay we go!"
5,"A homie from the East Side Daly City , Ncali","Man when this album first came out every fool had it on the street it was so tight that it seemed that every car that pass by bumbed it.It reminded me when Too $hort came out every homie had it on the street.I`m telling you when music like this comes out word of mouth gets out fast but the thing that I hate the most is that only now it`s getting a bit of reogotion.They even made viedos the one I seen was 3.Ave,The.The bay got much talent like any other citys around but when the world don`t about that`s #uked up.Like the stuff they play on the radio,Mtv,BET etc don`t even compare well maybe some of it you be the judge of that?"
2,Sorry I bought this book,I purchased this book prior to visiting Japan. It gave me an idea of the overall layout of Kyoto and Osaka but was totally useless when I got there due to lack of details. I used maps provided by the Tourist Information Centers instead. I left it in the hotel room as it was not worth carrying back home.
2,Kyoto-Osaka map,"I used this a few times while living in Japan. Honestly, it was easier to use a navi or to just read the Japanese maps on the train stations."
3,After Further Review...,"Contrary to what some viewers say, this dvd is not cropped.The widescreen format is exactly the same throughout the film.However, it is true that one brief scene involving Stella Stevens has been deleted, probably due to an oversight."
4,The ultimate sixties spy spoof!,"This has to be one of the best spy/Bond spoofs coming out of the spy genre sixties. Many elements of Austin Powers originate here...the desert underground lair, Buono as the ""Dr. Evil"" villian, to name a few. Dean Martin is biting cool. The automated bath with Lovey Cravesit and his station wagon with slide-out bar and beds is the ultimate secret agent SUV. See it to appreciate not only this film but to appreciate Bond and Austin Powers."
3,The Silencers,"Ahh, another film in the tradition of the numerous spy thrillers of the 1960s. The Silencers stars Dean Martin as Matt Helm and Stella Stevens as the token woman sidekick, Gail Hendricks. I'm not going to beat around the bush with this one: if you're looking for good, cheesy fun, then this one's for you! It's the usual story: secret agent shags countless girls, drinks, looks suave (He! he! It is Dean Martin, after all. . ..) and then still has enough free time to save the world from nuclear holocaust. Oh, what a miserable life it must be! There are some great visuals in this film that definitely make it worth your while. Ya gotta love the dancing girls during the opening credits. And the hairstyles. . . whoo! Look out Vidal Sassoon, here I come! Yeah, the story is silly, but just grab a six-pack of Tab cola with some friends, sit back, and enjoy! Mr. Powers, look out! Dean Martin's at the ""helm"" and in control!"
2,dated formula movie,"Although I had good memories of this movie seeing it as a kid in the theatre, I was very disappointed seeing it again now. The only way its watchable, is to think of how Mike Myers would adapt some of it for Austin Powers later. Unlike the Bond and Flint flicks, this one is sort of a musical with Dino himself singing half a dozen numbers. The action scenes are stupid. Dino has not a single redeeming quality other than the adolescent wisecracks. The effects are extremely cheesy, and I can't even bear to watch the ""laser"" scene - the noisiest non-lasers ever envisioned. The women are treated like props more than any other movie I can think of - half a dozen beauties quickly pass through the movie during the credits and first 20 minutes - until it settles on Stella and Israeli actress Daliah. This movie was an obvious cheap copy of the Bond and Flint movies at the time, and it does not hold up well after 40 years."
1,I have not seen this DVD,"and I will not purchase it based on the other reviews. Any DVD that is edited is a slap in the face to consumers. Columbia TriStar should be ashamed.Like many other American companies (or worse yet run by greedy Americans) you lose sight of the very people you are trying to interest in your product. Ask yourself a question; would you want to pay 20 bucks for a cut up movie?I should state that I was born and raised in the US and have noticed how many American Fortune 500 companies forget how they got to be a Fortune 500 company to begin with.I am totally disgusted with consumers coming out on the short end of the stick because big companies think we'll buy anything. Not me, not this time. I'll spend my 20 bucks somewhere else and not on any Columbia TriStar DVD."
5,Rush Starman Tshirt,So happy I could just burst! Awesome Tshirt! Showed up in EXCELLENT condition and was just perfect for my husband's birthday present! He is a huge Rush fan! Fast service and just so pleased! I would give you a higher rating than what is shown! Thank you so much and I WILL ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!:)
4,A very good source but no portraits,"This is a fine collection of biographies of the captains who served under Nelson in the climactic battle of Trafalgar in 1805 and there are many details of their lives and careers, extending before, during and after that battle. Unfortunately, the author or the editors didn't consider important to include at least a portrait of every captain mentioned (there are only three), and I found this to be a major drawback to an otherwise very good book."
3,Not that great,It is made of very stiff plastic that is hard to fold so it ends up a big crumpled mess that takes up the whole storage space under the stroller if I need to bring it along 'just in case'
3,"2nd Review, 3 weeks later....rust","The description says ""DISHWASHER SAFE"" well, just as with my Sabatier steak knives that I was trying to replace for the same reason, I found that once you wash them a few times you get little rust stains. With my Sabatiers I would soak them in vinegar to remove them. With these Henckels, that doesn't even get rid of all the rust marks. I gave them 4 or 5 stars before because the knife handle is so comfy and feels nice in the hand and they look good, too, BEFORE you put them in the dishwasher I am going to try to return them. Too bad, at least change the description and omit the dishwasher safe. I don't mind hand washing my Shun knives but steak knives we use a lot and I want to put them in the dishwasher!!"
3,A fine book to be read with great care,"This is a fine, accurate and well-written account of 20th century South Africa.The denunciations of apartheid and the cataloguing of its pernicious effects on the African majority provide the compelling context for understanding various key issues of public health in post-apartheid South Africa.One easily grasps how protein anemia, upper respiratory illnesses, TB, childhood diarrhea, widespread malnourishment and the absence of clean drinking water and improper disposal of human and animal waste were all among the lingering effects of apartheid governance.The perceptive reader will see how the lingering impact of 100 years of segregation and harsh apartheid produced rampant ill health among Africans. If you're looking for the roots of so-called ""AIDS cases"" in the Rainbow nation, you need look no further."
4,"Great, Fast read!","Priceless is a gripping and suspensful book. The characters are all well thought-out and you can actually see them as if they are right there in front of you. Marne Davis Kellogg is a wonderful writer that puts you right in England, French Riviera and the rest of the wonderful places that Kick Kerwick visits. Even the food and wine she descibes makes you hungry and thirsty. This book is a great, fast read and I couldn't put the book down...a great summer read laying by the pool. Can't wait to read her next book!"
5,Hopefully not the last story...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Brilliant. Kellogg has created a great character in Kick Keswick. I finished this book in two days, the story moves quickly with intrique and wonderful new characters.The only complaint I would have is the rehashing of the background story. Since I had just read Brilliant I found it redundant, but it would be nice for those who did not read the first book. I would suggest reading it though as it is a great book also.The locales, food and detail of jewlery is amazing. You can tell alot of research went into this book. It is as rich a story as the desserts described!"
1,Absolutely Awful,"Anyone who has had the pleasure of seeing the maestro in action with his orchestra will know how his music touches the soul. All this album proves is how special the original soundtracks are and how important it is to leave Mr Morricone's original scores as they are. These ""cover versions"" don't come close in my opinion and putting words to ""Deborahs Theme"" from Once Upon A Time in America is a crime in my opinion. If your after the works of Ennio Morricone, get the originals. You will not be disappointed."
2,Dissapointed in Ennio Marricone's Latest,This CD was a real disappointment. It was contrived by using famous names to sing songs that should have been orchestred pieces. Yo-Yo-Ma-Plays-Ennio-Morricone was superb and I had expected some of the same quality which is not there.
3,Love Morricone and love some of this CD,"This CD has some amazing redux of Morricone's film themes, especially the Herbie Hancock rendition of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (except for the bizarre solo in the middle). Overall, this is a superb CD. The best take is Metallica's Ecstacy of Gold. Worth purchasing. I have it in my car CD player right now. It's worth the money."
5,We Love Ennio Morricone. Excellent Service from Abe Books,"I am delighted with the CD supplied by Abe Books in Texas - but even happier with the speed with which they dealt with my order. I was told by Amazon by e-mail to expect delivery week commencing 7th March (ie today) but I actually received it on 25th February. Excellent service. Thanks. As far as the CD itself is concerned, I have never thought that anyone could better Ennio Morricone's own versions of his work - and having heard this CD, I still believe that. Nevertheless, Metallica's rendition of The Ecstasy of Gold comes pretty close......."
4,We all love ennio morricone,"a very diverse and interesting collection of hybrid pieces based upon the work of morricone. my only complaint was that the invited artists were not highlighted enough in the pieces. otherwise, i would given this a 5. I especially liked the european flavor of many of the pieces."
3,An O.K. Selection,"Cinema buffs have lived with Maestro Morricone's music. This is a so-so compilation though: Celine Dion and Metallica? Give us a break. Here are the highlights: Quincy Jones and Herbie Hancock's version of ""the good the bad and the ugly"", Metallica's ""the ecstasy of gold"", Yo Yo Ma's highly emotional rendition of ""Malena"" and the three tracks by Morricone himself."
3,Somewhat interesting,There were no characters to hold ones interest. I got bored reading about yet another and another cattle drive with no person of interest to hold it together.
3,o.k. for the price,"I chose this laminator because it is so wide and because it advertised it could laminate 7 mil. The truth is at 5 mil you have to run the item twice and it still sometimes doesn't completely laminate if the item is at all thick (cardstock or photos). It's still a decent buy at such a reasonable price, and I use it often."
2,Not hot enough,"About a year ago I purchased the Quik Finish Home/Office Laminator Model PL100. It worked well for about 10 months to one year; since then it works poorly. It no longer laminates. The pages do not ""gel"" and the print is clouded and not glued together. I will not buy another QuikFinish Document Laminator again. The last laminator (brand I forget but it was not the above) I had lasted for years with perfect copies, then one day after thousands of applications it just ceased, but served me well. I hoped at a higher price, this would do even half as well. It failed me."
2,mediocre,"if you buy this, you'll still need another program to protect/identify spyware and other viruses. offers very low-level protection. identifies viruses and oftentimes can't even delete or remove infected files."
1,"Pretty good actuallyl, stellar and FREE support...","What does BD have that norton and McAfee don't? Besides a program that actually works, BD has free customer support, free 24-7 online support, and free email support.BD found a Trojan and 2 viruses on my PC that I purposely put there to test it. Zone Alarm Security suite did not, Norton didn't and McAfee didn't. The only other program that also found these was Trojan Hunter.Now that Zone Alarm has gone south with its virus and spam protection, it seems the only thing they have going for them is their firewall.BD has proven itself, by my reviews and in many PC magazines, to be the best AV on the market.Lets hope it'll still be that way in a year :)"
3,Great but short,"You'll like this, fun and cool to watch the old school scene. Unfortunately it's only about 30 min long, guess I should have checked that but that's why I'm putting it here. Nothing really new here tho, I mean, if you're into hip hop you've probably seen very similiar footage of these artists so it probably isn't worth buying unless you're just a serious head or collector."
4,Two in One,"Two novels in one book: SALT ""Reading for Men"" by Herbert Gold is at heart a story about New York which he knows inside and out - the intensity of Manhattan,Long Island society, Greenwich Village gone respectable, the underworld, Wall Street, Madison Avenue and about girls - and women - and ladies.Cockatrice by Wolf Mankowitz is a candid novel ... one of the raciest and most humorous novels ever written about the movie industry."""
3,Nice recorder,"It is a nice recorder. The recording quality at 3M (3h) is quite nice. That is the only setting I have tried. Editing out commercials from the recording is quick and simple. I have burned 8 DVD+R so far. I have no problem so far.One gripe I have with this recorder is the description on Amazon.com regarding the ""Guide plus Electronic Programming Guide"" is not correct. The recorder has VCR Plus programming."
1,user unfriendly,"This is one of the least user-friendly unit. Wish I had bought Japanese brands instead. This unit has many buttons on the remote: ""system menu"", ""guide"", ""navi"", ""browser"", ""tools"", ""disc menu"", ""playlist menu"", etc. All very confusing as to what functions are within each of these. Why couldn't they consolidate these into perhaps two menus?"
3,You get what you pay for,"The Philips DVDR520H is an affordable DVD recorder. However, it has lots of technical issues. The first few months mine worked fine but now it always gets stuck in the disc preparation processes. After about 5 minutes it ejects a ruined DVD. Lately 4 out of 5 discs get ruined before I even start recording."
2,Does NOT have GUIDE Plus+ electronic program guide (EPG),"Amazon's Product description is WRONG. This item does NOT have a 7 day Guide Plus+ electronic program guide (EPG). There are many many web sites that quote Amazon's description word for word. But they just copied it from Amazon. Download the Manual and you will see, there is no guide! I purchased this item directly from Amazon in Sept2005 for $149.99 and returned it 2 days later as it didn't have the guide. I did inform Amazon their description was wrong but they still haven't changed the description."
1,Haven't used this model but know Phillips products,"I haven't used this Phillips model but I owned a Phillips DVD/VCR once. Phillips has a history of good products such as their small stereo systems, or at least the one I have. I started with the stereo CD player and figured I would build from there. The next thing I bought was A DVD/VCR combo. Within 6mo. the VCR stopped working.Well, I tought, no problem it had a 1 yr. warranty, so I took it to an ""authorized repair shop"". They informed me that I would have to send the unit, at my cost, to Phillips HQ to get a rebuilt replacement ( this was the way the warranty would cover it) In short this would be more expensive and hassel than to buy a new and different brand. My conclusion is Phillips helped create the light bulb then a few years later the compact disc. Anything past that they pretty much suck. Stick with what you know Phillips, and it 's not customer service or recorders.Cal the Handiman"
1,Buyer beware!,"This product has a known defect for which Philips has limited support. The DVD drive would not recognize any disk. Their website ask you to download a software patch, for which you have to burn to a CDR+. I have two computers, one purchased in the past year, neither one will write to a CDR+ disk. I asked them to mail me the disk with the patch, they had no idea how they would go about doing that.Hey Amazon, help out your customers by refusing to sell Philips products. This will definitely have a negative impact on your business. Customers with this experience will be less likely to use Amazon in the future and you will keep getting stuck with shipping expenses."
1,Noisy and unreliable,"I bought and returned the DVDR520H.1) Main problem was the loud noise from vibration when playing back R and RW discs, which made them impossible to watch. This didn't happen every time, but most. Commercial discs played back silently.2) The machine crashes (freezes and has to be unplugged to reboot). On one occasion this happened when I programmed a recording. The recording didn't start and the controls were frozen. This means one can't have confidence programming will work. I wrote Philips to ask about software updates, got no answer until I insisted, then was sent an excerpt from the manual about how to program recording and nothing about updates.3) Editing is unstable. A thumbnail image can be set. Then it moves by itself as much as 20-30 seconds if the file is split further on and has to be redone."
1,do not buy phillips dvd recorders,"I bought a Phillips DVD recorder 2 years ago.I had minor problems with it from the start but let them go.A little after one year it quit completely.Philips agreed to fix it if I paid shipping costs.The shipping costs were more than some less expensive models at that time.It worked well for about six months, now it has quit again.Phillips has not mastered the art of DVD recorders."
3,Philips Global says this is European Model,"According to the Philips Global web site, this is a model produced for Europe - PAL, SECAM tuner, but recording says PAL, NTSC. AND, it specifically states on the specifications for this model that it is a REGION 2 model. Also, you cannot find it or support for it on the Philips USA web site. [...]The star rating above should be disregarded as amazon requires a rating. I cannot rate this item, only report what I have found out about it from Philips."
5,Concise guide for anyone interested in stop-motion,While it is not a substitute for hands on experience it will get you up to speed. This book is a fantastic introduction to anyone interested in this subject. Students of the art will get a basic primer to all facets of the stop-motion process. If it is not provided as college course reading you should pick up a copy for your self studying.
2,Not good,"I love pickled mushrooms and thought these would be great since I like other products by Reese. These have no flavor other then vinegar. They are sour, bland and don't even taste like a mushroom. I even tried rinsing them with water to try to get some of the vinegar taste out and it did help some. I'm thinking of trying to save them by adding some fresh herbs. I would not recommend these at all. I was worried about shipping, but Amazon did a great job shipping the glass bottles."
3,Not what I expected,If you have read the Conversations with God books and you think you are getting more of the same STOP get here and go get An Encounter With A Prophet. That book is more this book is not.
2,Letter to Earth,"After reading Neal Donald Walsch's Conversations with God series I developed a spiritual hunger for Books of this nature and believed with all my heart that I had found another treasure in Letters to Earth . Sadly , the wonderful concepts found in the book are hidden under slabs of overly convoluted language . Several times I found myself going back over sections in an attempt to break the psychobabble encryption that Ms.Wise seems to favour . This sort of literature should be presented as clearly and simply as possible so as to make it accessible to everyone who reads it . Unfortunately , letter to earth is a struggle to read and getting to the beautiful truths it contains is like digging through several feet of hard ground to reach a pocket of gold ."
3,The Spiritual equivalent of Chinese take out food,"Beautifully written but short on real sustenance. I would advise C.S. Lewis as an alternate menu. Begin with the Screwtape Letters. Having done so return to ""Letter to Earth"" and read it again. You'll see the inimitable and diabolical Screwtape capering and grinning-between the lines of course-on every page of ""Letter to Earth"".Jerry Furland, author of ""Transfer-the end of the beginning""."
1,"Rubbish, waste of paper, can i please have my day back!!!!","This is the worst contempory romance book i have read.The beginning is promising with its opening scene, but from there on its all down hill.The male protagonist is a likeable character, but as it seems with all of Chris Manby's book the female are either weak, shallow or compleatly stupid!!!!It does not portray women in the best of lights, and the storyline plods on abysmally, you spend more time reading about the life of the monkies than the romance between the two central characters.Manby's lead female roles are a poor man's Bridget Jones, and her books seem to follow the same path and sadly the novelty is wearing a little thin.All i can say is don't waste your day reading this book, i wish i could get back my valuable time!!!!! I would suggest reading Aint she sweet by Susan Elizabeth Philips or Playing James by Sarah Mason."
4,"A little rough, but still talented","I just picked up this CD last night @ Smoker's Barbecue in Finksburg, MD. I just finished listening to it for the second time, and I must say that there is definitely some talent there. The timing is a little off and the coordination is as little rough, but the songs are very good despite this. A little more work is required in order for this to be a great CD, but as far as it goes this is still a fairly decent offering. I'd recommend purchasing it and making a judgment for yourself. . ."
2,Not so necessary,"In ""Necessities: Chicago,"" author Kathy Kaplan takes readers on the tour of the service industry in Chicago -- from pet sitters to where to buy special gifts. The purpose is to allow the reader to be their own concierge and gofer. The inherent problem of the book is that, published in 1998, many of the service companies may not still be in business, thus making this as dated (or outdated) as a 1998 phone book. The author has, however, picked the ""exclusive"" cream-of-the-crop businesses for this compelation. Someone desiring the most personal $ervices money can buy should definitely look here. However, these same listings (sans the author's comments) can be found in the latest Yellow Pages, and definitely be more up-to-date."
4,"pretty, pretty, pretty.","These shoes actually look more delicate on than they look in the picture. Can you see the rhinestones on the ring?They are comfortable, fits true size, medium width. I am a 7.5 in sandals, and a 8 in boots, I got an 8 to fit my wide feet and they fit ok.Despite of how tall they are you can walk on these for a couple of hours. They have cushioning too and that makes them more comfortable than those other wooden sandals. They are somehow stable to walk.The butterfly on the heel adds something distinctive to them. They can be dress up (a little) or down.In the other hand, I had to cut little pieces of thread coming out of the ""leather upper"", (leather, definitively not ?). Overall they are very good for the price. They are much more expensive in other places."
3,Tasted better...,This wasn't too bad.. but the smell of the product was better than the taste. It smelled like the fruit it was named after but it didn't taste like it. But it didn't taste bad.
1,JUNO Free E-Mail and More!,"Writing about a software package is a very risky thing! The features keep on changing. This book might have been right on a few years ago, but JUNO has moved on. The book appears to be relavant to JUNO 1.49, which was for E-Mail only. Now, JUNO offers JUNO 4.0, which is for FREE internet access as well as offering many other free features. I look forward to an update."
2,Strictly for the beginner level computer user.,"Though I found this book light and easy to read, the information presented was quite vague in many areas. Mr. Rankin did not delve too deeply into any of the subjects covered, though he did discuss quite a few different methods of accessing various internet services by using email only.As a longtime computer user and programmer, I found the information in the book to leave alot lacking. The majority of information can be found on the web by using the many available search engines.In my opinion, if you are completely new to computers and email, this book may be helpful, though some of the topics covered may tend to be confusing. For medium level and advanced computer users, I'd suggest going to the search engines and finding the same information."
4,Victorinox 5- inch Mini Chef's Knife,I have always been impressed with the Swiss Army Knife so I wanted to give this knife a try. So far it has handled all the cutting jobs with ease. I like the size and it feels good in my hand. The size allows you to do a variety of cutting jobs.I can highly recommend this knife.
4,Fun,Recommend to all my friends. This is really a fun way to help improve your mind. I is fun even if you don't need any improvement.
4,Great insight into prion disease,"This was a great story as well as being enlightening. The last few chapters were a little bit noisy and not as refined as the rest of the book.The main criticism I have of this book is that it never proves or shows its thesis, which is the ""hidden connection between mad cow and Alzheimer's"". Never gives any real evidence of it, just hints at it here and there. However, it is very enlightening into the history of prion disease and I'd highly recommend this book since for the most part it stays completely away from pseudoscience and focuses on factual history. I thought this book would make me more paranoid, but actually having a little more understanding made me less paranoid. Although, I will be careful about the type of beef (or any other meat) that I eat and I would never for the life of me eat venison."
1,Emotion not science,"Will being a vegetarian make you healthier? - Yes.Will using an emotional argument to claim prions in meat is the cause of the majority of dementia be well recieved? Yes, but it's wrong, not scientific, unproven, and very conspiracy driven."
2,As an introduction fails sometimes,"I read this weak book, here in Brazil.This book is a very short and concise general Patton's biography.Even as an introduction, this book is weak and biased.To exemple, Patton was a racist.This book simple doesn't shows, this detail about Patton.Patton was also an spiritualist, but this book also forgets this fact.About Patton's death, this book fails, because it doesn't shows that press' hate to Patton came from leftism, then (as today) with majority into american press.Even as an introduction about Patton's life, this book isn't the best choice."
3,Victorinox 10 inch Chef's Knife,This knife is well balanced and made with high quality steel. I think the real test of a knife is how well it resharpens because I prepare two or three meals a day. Using the spyderco Tri Angle Sharpmaker System I am able to maintain a sharp blade easily with a dozen or so strokes on each side. The edge retention is ok. This is a big knife that excels at cutting large vegetables.
5,This is by far the best & most effective knife I've ever used.,I have owned many different high end knives over the years and this inexpensive knife wins the prize for sharpness and ease of handling. It is a pleasure to use.I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to use excellent kitchen tools plus the price was sooo right!! Don't hesitate to buy it. You'll be happily surprised.
2,"Disappointed. good ingredients, bad taste.....",I purchased this product after reading everyone's reviews here hoping it's as good as everyone said it was. I must say I'm very disappointed by how it tastes. It is just like fruit leather... dry and not very tasty. These are just like the fruit leather they sell at Trader Joe's. Now I have 29 of these left and I can't return them.
4,Great snack for all.,My husband and I are addicted to these fruit snacks. I love that they are a sweet treat without being junk; each bar is a serving of fruit. I often bring these as a snack for my nephew and he really likes them. It is a little deceiving because even though they say they are strawberry fruit snacks they are mostly made of apple unlike some other natural fruit snacks. I still love them and with amazon subscription we never run out.
4,Very useful,"Fighting on the Floor is a very difficult thing. Everyone who does a martial art covering that topic knows that. But when a ""real"" fight goes to the ground, everything's much more difficult. So in this book, MacYoung describes ways to keep the damage on your side as low as possible, and getting the damage on the opponent's side as high as possible. And like all the other books from this author, it's the neat little tricks that make this topic interesting."
3,"It's alright, but not the best","Cheap Shots, Ambushes, etc was better. Some right-on advice and a few nasty ideas/moves. Worth buying, but don't expect too much...he basically says being on the floor is bad, so don't do it, and get up really quick if you go down."
4,Another great book by Charlotte Vale Allen.,"I think the part of this book that hooked me was Honoria's energy towards everybody around her. In a time when many people still looked at black people and assumed they were nothing more than hired help, Honoria hired May as her personal assistant and treated her as an equal from day one. When the son of Honoria's best friend comes to her for help (wanting to prove that his fiancee was murdered, and didn't commit suicide) she reluctantly agrees to ask around and see what she can find. Toss in her loyal housekeeper, Mick (her Russian lover who everybody thinks is her husband), and a smattering of other characters and you've got a great story. Aside from the actual story, I liked the fact that the author kept the number of characters minimal so that you didn't have any trouble following who was whom."
1,My Gravedigger flip and crash by Hotwheels sucks!!,The car body on top is lost. It pumps up okay but when I put it on the ground and even with a push -nothing. I have to throw it if I want it to flip and crash. Im going to try and turn it into a water pistol.
3,Truck won't stay together.,"I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas. It's a major disappointment. The truck body will not stay on. It's meant to come off when you crash, but we can't get it to stay on long enough to even pump it. The handle sticks to far, which makes it hard to play with. We eventually wrapped a piece of clear packing tape around it to keep the body on."
2,Not worth it...,"My son is 5 and not impressed with this monster truck. Once the body falls off, it doesn't stay on, so all you see is the frame of the truck. He hasn't played with it since he's gotten it. Not really worth the money."
3,Not Safe After Dark,If one were to have a serious complaint to put forth about this good anthology by Petewr Robinson it would be that the marvelous Inspector Alan Banks is present in only three of the stories herein. Nothing futher need be said to the growing number of Banks devotees in the U.S. but the uninitiated may wish to know more. The stories which feature Robinson's compassionate'music-loving and ultimately very tough British policeman are just interesting enough to whet the appetites of those who love P.D> James's Dalgleish and Ruth Rendell's Wexford. They are well worth the reading of them but Robinson reveals himself to be far more than a one-trick pony as he ranges beyond his stellar creation to construct short gems that are often as lyrical as they are true to the protocols of his genre.
4,I LOVE Inspector Banks novels...,BUT I'm not as crazy about Peter Robinson's short stories. I have read all of the Inspector Banks novels and was looking for a bit more. These shorts are okay but not as great as the full length novels. All of Robinson's novels get 5 stars.
3,Great for kids not adults,"I understand why the one reviewer did not want to give it as a gift for an adult ornament exchange as I wouldn't either, but these are perfect for young children. I do not know how durable they will be but as long as they last through one holiday season I will be pleased. For under $5, for the functions they offer, I think its quite a deal. I bought 4 of them."
1,embarrassing,"I bought this for an ornament exchange party and when it came in, I was too embarrassed to use it so ended up buying another ornament."
2,This book is available for FREE on Google books,"This book can be read online for free on Google books and on the Portal to Texas History website. You don't have to purchase it unless you want a hard copy of it, but be aware that it will be a print on demand book.As for the book, it does have valuable information but there numerous errors and the book was not indexed properly.There are good pictures, but quality will only be good in the original books; the reprint has poor quality.I am wondering if the other reviewer received their copy of this book or ever received their money back if not."
5,My husband is the pianist!,"Miss Amara is a wonderful person as well as having had a long career. She and my husband, Richard Woitach, make terrific music together."
5,Hooked on Hitch,"I love it! Just as entertaining as seasons one and two, which I also enjoy. His introductions are funnier and more involved in season three, and of course the drama and writing are excellent! Cant wait for 4 and 5. Also kudos to Amazon for incredibly fast delivery!"
4,Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season Three,"Once again I had to watch this great works from region one DVD in a region four country, When are these DVD producers going to learn take off this region crap and you get a much bigger market for you DVDs? for goodness sake get a brain that can work out how to market DVDs! do I have to wait for Amazon to get ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season four in ZONE FOUR"" before I can buy my next DVD from Amazon? because I am bloody sick of getting zone one to watch in New Zealand that is a zone four country, as there is nothing else to watch with entertainment, but the same rubbish in the DVD shops as what is on free to air Television.Note for Amazon market ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season four in all ZONE"" and you have one sold to New Zealand customer."
5,Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season Three,Anything done by Hitchcock is great! I used to watch these on television. Great stories that still allow you to use your imagination.
5,Alfred Hitchcock Presents - Season III,"Excellent service and an excellent TV show in the finest of quality. Hitch brings back many memories from childhood with his patent on ironic endings. Too bad shows like this aren't produced anymore. Today's television has turned to trash; just like today's music and today's sports. The '50s and 60s were certainly the golden age for ""young folks"" like me. I've got all of Alfred's TV episodes and love watching them over and over again and seeing old stars make new beginnings."
4,Fascinating tale,"The author piques our interest with the title and keeps the reader engaged in the tale. It is very well told, in a dignified way - worthy of the person on whose behalf it is written. The pace at which things move seem very real for medieval world and it impressed me that Bard could capture it and it amazed me even more that Queen Berengaria was not only a strong and capable lady, but also a scholar of depth. The book was wonderful, and I'm eagerly looking forward to reading her tale about Queen Joanna who is a character in this book as well."
4,Queen Without A Country,"It is a great historical fiction. You feel like you are there -- and you marvel at her strength, endurance, and intelligence. Wow!"
3,It's an OK read,"I have always been fascinated with the story of Queen Barengaria, and this answered a lot of questions. Of course, I'm easy - I see something in print and figure it's gospel truth. Didn't like reading bad things about Eleanor of Acquitaine because she has been one of my favorite people of her time. No wonder she got mean - she lived far too long. Enjoyable read, but I'm not suggesting you drop everything and take this one to bed."
4,A Place in History,"I really enjoyed this book. I was curious about someone whom I may have heard mention about, but knew nothing except that she had been Richard I's wife. I knew a lot about him so I was interested. What I like about this book, compared to so many other historical fiction novels, is the lack of rediculous, embarrasing sexual descriptions. Also, the main character is not a super-woman, but someone who seems very real and good. She was someone I could relate to as opposed to a sexual goddess type that you usually find in these sorts of books. The historical information is extremely well-researched and presented in an interesting way. The characters are well-developed and likeable."
3,Wasted my money,"This book might appeal to someone who knows little of Berengaria. I think the author's style is better suited to non ficton than fiction. The author ""tells"" but doesn't ""show"" the drama and action a novelist should. The author has a wonderful subject and story to tell. She didn't take full advantage of her material. Because of inaccurate statements the author tells as ""facts"", I lost interest. I am sorry I wasted my money."
5,Better than Prozac!,"You can't help but feel better listening to these talented guys. I've made it known that I want ""About You"" to be played at my next wedding or funeral whichever one comes first! If you miss the feeling that life is good, play this CD and sit back and go on the journey that C&K lays out for you in perfect harmony."
5,"A basic ""food group"" of local kau-kau for da ear!!","Wherever you are, if you miss the days of crusin to da beach and grinding loco-moco's, this cd going bring you back brah! Even if you no moa beach wea you stay, chrow dis one in da cd player and close your eyes."
5,"Brah, dis going fo go stay one o da bes fo da rest o my life","Howzit!!!! Da best. Bus out da slippas, grab some brews & kick it with friends. Brah, dis one going bring back da good kine memories. Up with Marley, Gabby, Makaha Sons, and Keola. No matter how far you are from ""home"" this will always bring you back."
2,cheap item at a high price,I paid about twenty-five dollars for this item and was sorely disappointed in it's lack of quality. I would question even paying ten dollars for it. It doesn't even look like it will last a week's worth of use. Part of the pad is already pulling apart where it is glued.
3,ooops,I thought it was for a chair but when I receivbed it I found out it was for wheelcahirs. My father uses a wheelcahir and hates it. I do not recommend!!
2,Potentially Good Reference; Not for Pedagogy,"I have been a software development ""practitioner"" for fifteen years. I decided to take a graduate class in software engineering to brush up on my skills and this was the textbook used.There is quite a bit in this book that applies to development environments ten to fifteen years ago and relatively little that applies to current trends.Much of the material is also presented ""shotgun manner"" where many techniques from different sources are just thrown out without much attempt at comparison.I came away with a worse impression of ""software engineering"" as a discipline than when I started.I do think this text could be used as a handy encyclopedia: a starting point to find a definition or two and a jumping point for further research on a particular topic."
1,Horribly written,"If you are a software engineer already, or if you are a CS professor, you might find this book marginally entertaining. Otherwise, if you are a student trying to learn the material, you will find this book horribly written. Here's an example: software process is defined as ""process, methods, and tools layers described in Section 2.1.1 and the generic phases discussed in Section 2.1.2."" Quite a lazy way to define one of the most important terms in the book."
1,Outdated and verbose,"This book is ancient. In this day and age of Object Oriented Analysis and Design this type of book should be put on display in a museum. This book may be good for someone who is still using fortran, cobol, or pascal. However, it will set your development efforts back 10 years if you are trying to write extensible, supportable, useful code with minimum bugs. The author spends way too much time quoting TLAs from academic wonks that worked on the first electric circuit. A great cure for insomnia. Not recommended for people with suicidal tendencies."
1,Do not buy this book,"The book recommends itself to the last year undergraduate and first year graduate student. If you are looking for a tourist view of Software Engineering buy this book. It does not stand on its own, it briefly quotes other books. After reading selections from several chapters repeatedly I find it hard to believe anything useful can be gathered from it."
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought this book for an undergraduate course in software engineering. I was thoroughly unimpressed by the book. Pressman attempts to cover too many topics within SE and ends up doing none well. Topics such as documentation, client/server architectures, and internet design are sketchy at best. I think that most of the useful information in this book could be condensed into about 200 pages. I'd think twice about tossing down the bills for this particular text, especially if you are a student and not a professional."
2,Bought it only because it was a text book,I love to program. I learn new languages just because I don't know them. This book is MAJOR boring. I only own it because it's a required text book for a class I'm taking. Buy it for that reason. No other.
3,Not a good book about se in my option,"These book covers almost everything about se, but everything in its superficialness. It's just a hybird of too many viewpoints.It's better used as a reference book if you are a new comer or not familar with some se concept."
1,Strongly not recommended,"This book never talks about teamwork, which is the core of any software engineering. It talks about testing in the one of the last chapters and then it contradicts itself by recommending early software testing. Finally it is not written for undergraduate student but rather for someone with a PHD."
1,Sorry Excuse for a textbook!,"The author of this book uses terminology that goes over your head. You get caught up in the vocabulary and forget what you are reading. This is more like a 888 page research paper (A paragraph, then a paragraph of quoting, then a few more paragraphs, and a bulleted list from someone else) Excuse me, write the book USING YOUR OWN WORDS, insead of quoting everyone else!"
2,A Vague book for a vague subject,Its a typical mediocre college book. Nothing particularly insightful or interesting about software engineering here. Just a poorly constructed collection of chapters that vaguely map out a software engineering paradigm. Entity relationships?? Dataflow?? Hello?? Nothing like that here.
2,A book written by a PhD for other PhDs to make you buy!,"I had to buy this book for a class and I can honestly say I got very little useful information from it. I have been a practicing software engineer for 12 years - all of it on the bleeding edge (client server, fat client, distributed computing) and much of this book is outdated and related little to what I feel is done in practice. I found it ironic that such an academic tome uses the words ""Pracitioner's Approach"" in the subtitle. If you want to know what people who study software engineers think they do, buy this book. Otherwise, save your money and subscribe to any of the several good trade magazines which address current issues."
4,"Good book, but perhaps not the best textbook","I read this book with a dual purpose. I am a software developer who is starting a new software engineering project at work as well as a part-time graduate student studying for a comprehensive master's exam. I found this book quite an entertaining read for this genre. It is very well written. It has also given me a lot of good ideas for my upcoming software project. This is an excellent book for someone who wishes to hone their software engineering skills. While this book may make an excellent companion text, I do not think it would work as well as a textbook for someone with no experience in Software Engineering."
2,Pretty bad textbook.,"I'm a software developer with almost 15 years experience. I'm taking a M.S. level class that uses this book, and I have to say that it's a horrible textbook. Although it imparts some useful knowledge, you will constantly find yourself looking for supplemental information on the Internet. There is not enough information supplied in the textbook to do the assigned homework! Explanations are sometimes jumbled and incoherent. Examples are extremely sparse--if you're lucky, you'll get 1 example of a particular topic, but most of the time you get none.I am very disappointed with this book. I can't imagine how this book has become so prominent in the software engineering world. Only in academia, I guess..."
3,Pretty good soundtrack but why not just turn on the radio?,"More songs from the 70's,,, Yeah! Anyhow, I grew up a little after this era but these songs were still popular in the 80's and were blasting out of car stereos at all of the parties. I already have most of the songs from this soundtrack on album or cd, so I don't think I will be getting this one. I'm glad to see that some of younger generation can appreciate these classic tunes.Anyhow, Why didn't they put the Budgie song on here (Crash course in brain surgery)? This song was playing in the background of the party at the surf shop. I remember when Metallica did a cover of this song, and it was excellent. Budgie was a pretty rockin band."
4,Let's Go Space Truckin',"The soundtrack was better than the movie. The best musical moment during the film was when Space Truckin'(#9) was played.Waiting for the credits to roll...Ah, who is this band called Deep Purple anyway? They're excellent. Check out their album Machine Head (1972) which not only has Space Truckin', but Smoke On The Water and Highway Star."
2,"2 Songs, Out Of The Whole Entire Cd, Are Okay","First, I would like to say that The Lords of Dogtown is a very well done movie, and I can see how the music in the movie fits into the whole skateboarding theme. But personally, I don't like this kind of music. I think the two songs on this CD that are okay are numbers 2 and 9. And they are just OKAY!!! So, if you are a fan of the movie, and like this style of music, this soundtrack is for you. But if you liked the movie, and are wondering where Boulevard of Broken Dreams is, DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
1,Pales in comparison,"Just as this movie is a weak fictionalized version of the original documentary Dogtown & Z-boys, this soundtrack is a weak rip off of the soundtrack to that documentary.Both feature tracks by Hendrix, Nugent, Rod Stewart, etc.But the first soundtrack is a much better listen and the package is a collector's item filled with original and rare photos by Glen Friedman and CJ Stecyk (both who bowed out from involvement with the feature film)Do yourself a favor and buy the Dogtown and Z-boys OG motion picture soundtrack instead."
3,uhhh,before i saw this movie i was thinking it would be really stupid and about some posers. but the soundtrack made up for it and the movie wasnt as bad as i thought it would be..
5,great cd,I love this cd it has so many great songs on it if you are thinking about buying it GET IT!!!
3,Lords of Dogtown review,Not a bad compilation of tracks. Some great old songs as well as newer ones. Fits the mood of the movie. Recommended.
2,the best songs are missing.,"though there are some good songs on this soundtrack, it is disheartening to see that the best songs from the movie - The Stooges' ""TV Eye"" and Funkadelic's ""Super Stupid"" were not included. only Social D covering The Clash might make this worth puschasing."
4,pretty sweet,"I've seen this movie once in theatres and twice at home, and I must say, it's one of my favorites, and the soundtrack has a lot to do with it. I was so happy to see that the sountrack wasnt all covers, because clearly the originals are better. My favoirite is ""Fire"", By Jimi Hendrix. The soundtrack is really really good, with kick-ass 70's music for a very 70's movie. groovy."
4,"Amazing movie, great music to go along with","i just saw the movie last night, and let me tell you, everytime i listen to ironman by black sabbath it takes me back to the movie, much like every song does. i highly recommend you go see this amazing movie, anyone would enjoy it."
4,Ok but could be better.,"Cream, Neil Young, Pink Floyd. Just a few artists that where left off the soundtrack that would have made it soo much better. Otherwise a decent album."
4,Pretty pleased,"I have to admit, I didn't care for the Brother printer at first. But it has definitely grown on me. Glad I gave it chance! It does a very good job of printing, and I'm very pleased with the scan capability. So far it's been a very dependable printer. I had assumed it would come with ""sample"" print cartridges, but was pleasantly surprised to find they were ""full-sized"" cartridges."
5,works great!,"After looking at the reviews, here, I decided to get this printer, and after a month it still works really well. Good prints, and relatively fast. It took a couple times of running the programming disk through, due more to my lack of expertise, I suspect. A good buy!W.Callow"
3,It works,"No real complaints about this machine, and the price says it all. It does a decent job of copying documents, but as far as a photo printer - forget it. Blotchy and streaked photos every time. Also lacks fax capability, so really not an ""all-in-one."""
4,Not Bad for the Price,"I got this printer for my girlfriend who mainly uses it for her grad school assignments so nothing fancy. It's easy to use, and the quality is pretty good. One shortcoming would be the photo prints, we tried to print a photo with the photo paper which came with the printer but it kept getting jammed...does anyone have a hint to share?"
3,correction to review,Well at first it was a bad transaction I had gotten the wrong book but the seller made it right and sent the correct book with their regrets of the previous bad transaction.
3,Conspiracy theories all over,"The book was fairly well written, but the conspiracy theory aspect was overdone, to the point of bothering me. I liked the two major characters, but I somehow couldn't get into the story completely. I'm not sure that I will buy more books by the author, unless I use the free sample first."
5,a real pageturner,"I have read all of Brendan Dubois' novels and mysteries and found this to be the best by far. It sparked my interest right from page one and I was enthralled right to the end. I only wish it was longer. Dubois' other novels were also very good. I really enjoyed all the Lewis Cole mysteries but ""6 Days"" is his best work to date. Keep them coming Brendan !!"
5,"Beautiful, loving correspondence",This is still one of my favorite books years after I read it. The openness and honesty expressed between this couple should still serve as an example for couples today. Their love story is an inspiration.
5,Great shoes worth it!,"I bought these for my son who knows how to punish sneakers. After several months of daily use they still look great. He is very sensitive to how things feel when he wears them, and he hasn't had any complaints (he's 12).I would recommend these."
5,My favorite Adidas shoe!!,"I started using Campus when I was in high school (5 years ago), and they were awesome. I bought a new pair this year (this time Campus II) and they feel and look exactly as I remember. These are the best looking and most comfortable Adidas shoes IMO."
5,great experience,"I had great experience purchasing the product, arrived on time, exactly what I ordered. the information I got prior to the purchase as size conversation tables helped to make the right choice. nothing else..."
4,I like but...,"The Adidas campus are a comfortable pair of shoes. The laces are pretty thick which complement the shoe well. The fault that I did not like was when I received the package were the toe of the shoe. On the left shoe, it is well rounded similar to the picture with different views but the right shoe is long and narrow. They look different but still have the same style."
5,THE BEST SNEEAKER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THE BEST SNEAKER AROUND.IT IS VERY COMFTABLE AND I WILL ALWAYS BE GETTING THEM FOREVER,BILLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,May cause foot injury!,"I purchased Adidas Campus 2 athletic shoes for my daily walks. I walk for perhaps 50 minutes each day. My walks are not strenuous activity, I'm just going out for a walk on a paved path in a park. These shoes have caused ""turf toe"" which is a common sports injury. Turf toe is another name for: First Metatarsophalangeal Joint Sprain. This is a common injury of football players who are playing on hard artificial turf. It is caused by poorly designed shoes having a soft sole, especially in the forefoot. I believe the Adidas Originals Campus 2 may cause foot injury. They do not allow the foot to rock forward gently like running shoes do. They bend the big toe improperly so the first metatarsal joint makes an 'L' when walking. After I contacted Adidas customer service, they said these shoes were, ""not meant for athletic use,"" even though they are described as ""basketball shoes."" Be very wary of these shoes."
3,This item is not always SUEDE!,"Although this was a nice shoe and along the lines of what I was looking for, I ordered this in the Espresso/Brown combination and it was hemp, not suede. Take a close look at the color swatch on-line. If it looks like canvas, it is."
2,Not The Color Described In Ad,"The shoes described in the Amazon ad are Navy Blue, however, when my shoes arrived and I opened the box I found Steel Blue (Blue-Gray) pair of shoes. Navy Blue is a medium to dark Blue and these shoes are anything but...they almost look like they might have been a darker blue at one time but then faded."
2,Very Uncomfortable,I'm really surprised at the reviews for these shoes because they are extremely uncomfortable. It is very disappointing too because they look awesome but I don't know whose feet are shaped like the insole? Especially men's feet. I wear a size 12 and the arch support is too steep and they are narrow. These seem to be shaped more perhaps for female feet?
4,love the shoes,shoes are great i would of given them five stars but they run really small got new bigger sizes wonderful
5,Not a believer... but this book's good.,"Of all the books written about Nostradamus' prophecies, this one is one of the few that tries to be objective and doesn't present silly and ridiculous arguments and interpretations. Hogue actually recognises the fact that many of the seer's quatrains are so extremely vague that they allow themselves to dozens of different interpretations. Or.. could Nostradamus have been so amazing as to write one quatrain that predicts different events? I don't know, but I'm sure some like to think so."
5,ARE OUR DESTINIES PREDETERMINED?,"I become thoroughly engrossed in this book from the very beginning. It is quite lengthy, 976 pages, and it is certainly a book that takes some time not only to read but digest. Was Nostradamus a prophet, a genius, a madman - the reader will need to reach their own conclusions.In some respects, the book can be interpreted almost as one interprets their daily horoscope. Given a wide scope, the reader can apply a prophecy to fit almost any situation depending on the existing surroundings, circumstances, conditions, and what is happening in the reader's life at that given moment. For anyone who firmly believes in predetermined destinies, they will find the philosophies and beliefs of Nostradamus both intriguing and thought proking. The message can be deep and readers are often compelled to look deep inside themselves for a clearer understanding of the prophecies of this 16th Century, French doctor and astrologist."
4,opinions on nostradamus,"did you people ever think that maybe these people don't care about all the negative things you have to say about there interests? I found your reviews quite offensive and frankly, I don't care about the red cross and am a great deal more interested in nostradamus. I'm not trying to say he could accuratly predict the future, but I do think all of it is interesting."
1,Politically Motivated?,I've read a number of John's comments and interpretations concerning Nostradamus and our current President Bush and it is clear that he is biased against President Bush. Since he is so clearly liberally biased how can anyone trust his review of Nostradamus's Prophecies? This is like believing everything Dan Rather says is the gosphel.
3,Don't expect to find quotes from your bogus emails in here.,I'm not surprised to see this selling so well over the past week. Never underestimate the power of junk emails and talk radio. I have not read it but I understand it to be a fairly straightforward account of the whole Nostradamus thing. Can't you just see the dorks who ordered this based on those bogus emails poring through the text trying to find the quotes from the emails. HELLO!!! They ain't in there people. You were had...Check it out.
3,No answers here!,"Call me a cynical old atheist, but readers expecting to find a catalogue of future events here should take heed. Nostradamus's 16th century writings were written in such an obscure code that they could basically be interpreted as predicting virtually anything (but crucially only with the benefit of hindsight). This is nevertheless an informative and interesting book. I am merely cautious about its sudden explosive popularity. Are we really so desperate and lost as a people, that we need to resort to this for an insight into recent events? This is stimulating stuff, but a history of recent Middle East politics would be a far more valuable guide to the recent dramatic and horrific developments in Washington and New York."
1,Horribly true,"I couldn't agree more with the other reviewer calling frightening the fact that people are clinging to this piece now. What's ""horribly true"" is that Nostradamus' work is so ambiguous that it can and HAS been applied to every human event ever since it saw the light of day. Whether or not ""destiny"" exists is open to extended discussion (I for one don't believe that so many people and events could ever be so synchronized that when I have an accident it means some impossible cosmic force just targeted little old me), yet it seems people tend to forget how many hundreds of times the end of the world has ""come and gone"" according to predictions. Just like he/she said, instead of throwing your terribly needed money on this garbage, donate it to the Red Cross, or give it to your children or save it for the sure to come Life book with the traditional incredible photos of the WTC events..."
1,Coating flakes off into food!,"After a year or so of use, the coating started to come off into the food. KitchenAid refused to replace it.Don't buy this one, get the uncoated version. I took a Dremel to mine and ground all of the white coating off, it works fine now with no more little white crunchy plastic bits in my cookies."
1,"Poor, poor service from seller","I purchased this beater because it looks exactly like the beater that I needed to replace my original beater. However, when my order arrived, it was not the beater as pictured. I contacted the seller and they told me I should have read the details of what model machine the beater fits. However, I discovered that even the item number that is listed by the beater pictured isn't even the correct item number for that beater! Their response was basically - it wasn't their problem - even if the picture was incorrect and that I should have been more careful when ordering. I was told I could ship this incorrect beater back to them, lose the shipping on the original order, pay to ship the incorrect beater back to them, then purchase another beater from of them for $10. more than the original beater??? I will never do business with this company again! Very poor customer service!"
2,It's the wrong itm for my machine,"Unfortunately it's not the right item for my machine. It is a nice beater, and in excellent condition, but it doesn't fit my mixer. Can I return this item for a refund?"
4,I loved Katherine's drive and determination,"This book would come off as melodramatic if it were not so well written. While her upbringing was unconventional, it was never without the love and support of her family. The characters were colorful without being unbelievable. The only part that I felt was predictable was Sarah and Pete's relationship. As Katherine grows up and deals with each new setback and challange, I found myself identifying with her struggle. Sections of this novel made me laugh out loud, while others brought me to tears."
2,Not so good.,"After reading many of L'Engle's children and teen books, this I saw this one at the library and took a chance. Bad idea. Maybe it's just because I wasn't ready for it, (I'm 13) but I have read other adult books before and liked them.This book was just mostly depressing. Nothing happened like I wanted it to (okay, I know that doesn't happen in real life, but so what) and the whole thing just had a bleak feel. Maybe that was partly because I read it on a rainy Saturday. But neither romances worked out (With Charlot or Pete) and the friendship with Sarah turned out to really be a dud. Sarah really turned into a unlikable character.One of the best times of the book was when Katherine and Sarah are friends at boarding school and then that friendship gets ruined by the mean head lady.Katherine drinks so much in this book when she's so young, but maybe that was more normal when this book was written.I didn't really like this book, I think I'll stick to L'Engle's fantasy and young adult books."
2,I found it depressing,"I just want to warn potential readers that I found this book very depressing. Don't read it if you need something upbeat in your life right now. I do and this was not it. I LOVE ""And both were young"" and was hoping for something like that, but found this book much more focused on the negative. It also has more adult material the the other. I wan to to read the sequel, I imagine that will help. It is a well written and insightful book, just rather sad much of the time. It wanders around though, and doesn't really have an ending, though I guess hopefully the sequel provides that :)"
5,Best Real-Life Story,Katherine's experiences at her boarding school are so realistic and relative to my friend's experience it was uncanny. I was not surprised by how Sarah turned out. You could tell by the way she was there for Katherine but yet totally impersonal. I cried so hard towards the end of the book because of what happens to her engagement. I love Katherine's determination and her amazing love-life really caused me to accept how pople change. I would absoloutly recomend this book to anyone who wants an excellent read.
4,An Outstanding Literary Debut,"I first became acquainted to the works of Madeleine L'Engle when I read 'A Wrinkle in Time' in the fourth grade. I thought it was brilliant, and still do, but I was hesitant to give 'The Small Rain' a try. It didn't sound too interesting, and its size intimidated me (it isn't that long, but boring books always seem longer than they really are.) I did read it, and I was shocked by how great it was. It's wonderful. Its like one of those great 1940s movies, loaded with nostalgic, of-the-time dialouge and likeable--although perhaps unrealistic-- charecters. It's well conceived, witty, and a plain good read. I think anybody could enjoy this book."
5,Best Hammock to travel with-Period!!!,"When you leave home, you want all of the comforts of your backyard hammock without all the disadvantages. This lightweight heavy-duty hammock does it all. It packs up into a nice small package that includes the comfortable mesh hammock, interlocking stretcher bars that keep it from folding up around the person and tree-friendly adjustable straps to hang it from. I have found no other hammock on the market that can make this claim. The price is really great, too. When it first came out a couple of years ago, it sold for about double the Amazon price you'd pay today."
5,Great vacuum,"I bought this little vacuum to replace my upright that costs almost as much, but has none of the suction power this little guy has. I use it mainly for bare tile floors in south Florida (lots of sand and fine dirt particles). I have three kids and a boxer that sheds quite a bit of fur. This thing sucks up all that dog hair and food crumbs with no problem. I bought the HEPA filter too. I used to have a very dusty house but not anymore (sweeping just moved the dust up into the air). As a bonus, this thing is small and stores away in the limited closet space I have for it.If your thinking about buying the yellow MM, don't. I'm sure the yellow one is well made too, but this one has a metal retractable tube, a stronger hose that doesn't really kink, as well as a stronger motor. Definitely worth the extra $20 for me.Bottom Line: This is an excellent buy."
1,Another cheap Chinese piece of garbage.,"This worked great for an hour. It strapped on my back, and I was able to easily get up and down a small stepladder to clean high up.And then, it died. The instructions said to leave it for half and hour and turn it back on. When I did that, it came back on for half a second, and died again. The instructions said not to return it, but to locate the nearest ""warranty center"" and call them. So, I did. I brought it in.And now, a week later, Amazon and Eureka have my money, the ""warranty center"" has the vacuum, and I have....zip. When I called them, they said that they haven't looked at it yet.What do you suppose the odds are that I'll ever see either the vacuum or my money again."
2,It sure does suck,"All I could think of after receiving it was the Suck n' Cut quote from waynes world: ""It sure does suck"".I think as a cheap and portable vacuum, maybe something you'd clean your car with, its fine. It has good suction, but thats about it. The construction is cheap plastic, the attachments and hose are awkward to use and store, and the wheels look like they are ready to fall off. When I tested it out, it scuff my hardwood floors, but it at least sucked up the dirt. On carpet it is virtually useless. I vacuumed the same rug several times, and afterward I could still pick off fuzz from the rug with my hands.Although it may have ""commerical"" in its name, its basically another POS fantastic plastic item. If you care about quality in anyway, I suggest looking elsewhere."
2,Sanitaire SCV3683,"There is plenty of suction on this vacuum but it is not that easy to use. I am 5'8"", not so terribly tall, but had to bend over to vacuum till it was very uncomfortable to use. Is everything built for midgets? Fortunately I took parts from my Mightly Mite, which burned up, I might add, and so was able to conteract this problem. The hose also keeps catching on the hook to wind up the cord on, so that was an inconveniece, too. It is hard to adjust the setting on the floor attachment, also. Therefore, I am not crazy about this vacuum."
1,Worst design ever!,"I have been cleaning houses for 35 years and I have never spent more time clearing out a vacuum hose more than this one. The design is simply ""bad"" there is a 45 degree angle that the simplest things get caught in and the suction power even when there isn't something to reem out is pathetic. This is the worst purchase I have ever made I would feel bad giving this vacuum away it has caused me so much frustration and grief. Ugh!"
3,"Sucks, but...","Great vacuum for picking up household dirt, etc....but the noise is unreal!We have to use ear plugs when using this because the high pitched noise is really over the top....if I had known it would be so loud, I would not have bought the product. It's much louder than my shop vac!Otherwise it sucks in a good way!"
3,Good but not as good as other reviews led me to believe,"This is my first canister vac in many years, so I don't have much basis for comparison to other canister vacs.It works nicely on hard surfaces like tile and vinyl floors, and (with the attachments) it can do the dusting, too, except around small items that could get sucked up.But it's just another canister vac when it comes to carpets. It doesn't come close to what an upright vac with beater bar can do on carpet. And I found the connection between the hose and the upper extension doesn't have enough friction, so there's an annoying tendency for it to come apart as I'm vacuuming (the extension part falls to the floor with a clatter, and I have to pick it up again and put it back on)."
4,Love it!,Love this vac! Agree with the other guy that mentioned it would be the perfect vacuum if it had an automatic cord. Have had this for a year and is still working strong.
4,"Works great, but is loud. . .","This is a great vacuum, if you don't mind it to be quite noisy. I expect a vacuum to make noise, but this is pretty loud. It's power easily makes up for it and it majorly ""sucks"" up the dirt and pet hair. It is a great buy, even w/ it being louder than an avg. vacuum."
5,great for the price,"This is a great little vacuum for the price. It can REALLY suck. We use it mostly on hardwoods and it picks up all the dog hair and dirt from the kids. It's not as effective on the rugs as our upright vacuum, but for the price it's still great. Easy to vacuum stairs and under furniture. If only the cord automatically retracted, it would be perfect."
4,Great compact vacuum!,"The vacuum is powerful and does an equally good job on floors, upholstery and carpet. It's a little bit heavier than I would like, but still managable when using the shoulder strap. I like it more than the Oreck I had previously. I'm really glad I went with the commercial grade instead of the lower grade version of this vacuum."
4,Canister vacuum,I gave this as a gift. It works out very well for their hardwood floors. It's also nice and light which makes it easy to work with.
4,Great little vac,"So far, so good. I've had this vacuum for about 1 month and I'm happy with it. I have hardwood, area rugs and wall to wall and it works fine on all. I also have two cats and it is doing a fine job of picking up the fur both from the floors and my furniture. If it lasts me a few years I will consider it a good buy!"
4,Good choice!,"This is a great little vac! I'd had a beat up canister for years, and needed something new, but I had no idea I'd be getting something this nice for this price.I use it on bare floor and carpet, and the suction was so strong that I had to open the vent on the handle...it lifted up one of my throw rugs. It worked well on cat hair, and I'm really pleased with it overall. It's a little noisy, and the cord wrap-up is not so great, but I do like it a lot."
3,Good vac for the price!,"Great vacuum for the price! Great suction and pretty sturdy. It is definitely heavier than I expected - much heavier than my previous Oreck handheld, but manageable. All parts are good but not extraordinary, except that if you plan to use it to vac bare floors you will be disappointed with the floor/carpet attachment. I just kept the one I used with my Oreck, so keep your old floor attachment if you have one.It is very loud so be prepared!Ultimately really good for the price!PS: It is HEPA ready but it does not bring the HEPA filter. You have to order it separately for $25!"
4,Very Good Canister Vacuum,"I have had this vacuum for a few weeks and it is one of the best. My only complaint is the noise. The motor is very loud, but most vacuums are. On the good side: it is relatively light, the extension wand is very good, and the suction is powerful. Ratio of price to quality is excellent. I am unsure why the extra hepa filter is so expensive (at around $20-25), butat least there is one available, though I have to say that the exhaust is nowhere near my old vacuum, and I am not sure the hepa filter is needed when using the allergy efficient bags. Overall, a super good buy."
4,great value and vacuum,looked at many vacuums. read on-line reviews and consumers reports. this vacuum is a great value for the money. noisy but has excellent suction.only disadvantage is that the bags and hepa filter are only available on line.
3,It's OK...,"It does an OK job vacuuming uncarpeted floor. On carpeted floor, I guess it's OK too, but I could only push but not pull. On both kind of floors, the hose easily falls and ends up on my toe. Why would they use metal to make the detachable hose part but plastic for the part that attaches to the vacuum. Because of the weight, the detachable hose keeps falling if you don't hold it in place. I wouldn't expect a $100+ vacuum has such design fault.."
1,Waste of money.,"This is the 2nd vacuum I bought within a year based on very high rate by Amazon users and AGAIN I am DISAPPOINTED. First of all I read a few reviews that it can vacuum rugs and thin carpet well. I am going to disagree. It is well below average. Very annoying as well. Since the tip of the suction doesn't have wheels to roll. It doesn't move smoothly on rugs or carpets. It just simply sucks and you just keep on pulling. Doesn't suck up dog hair that well either. As far as using it on hardwood floors and tiles. Yes, it flows smoothly on it but WHY would I want to carry this CLUNKER around making noise when I can just easily use a very soft asian style broom that I can easily buy at any asian market for under $10 and quickly brush away debris off the floor? This thing vacuums but it's more annoying than its worth. I guess this is going to the Salvation Army as well."
2,Not recommended,"Worked ok in the first 3 months I had it, although the suction was not what I expected. Now, even with a new bag and nothing blocking the hose, it will not pick up anything. You go over the same spot multiple times and nothing happens - even on bare hardwood floors. Have taken to vacuuming without the stick. Looking for a new vac."
2,disappointing pro,While this is a very powerful vacuum it has a design defect verified by the service representative. The wheels on this vacuum - and the replacement vacuum we received - do not turn on their own. Only when you physically move them will they work. This is a wonderful product if you wish to utilize the shoulder strap and carry it. Otherwise this becomes a very recalcitrant puppy that you have to drag along and scratch your wood floors. This is best on a carpet as there is no problem dragging it. We would suggest its cousin for less money the Eureka which we understand from the service center does not have this design defect. If you opt for the professional product the service center suggested placing large heavy duty rubber bands on the wheels - which did work well. We suggest purchasing a large amount of these rubber bands as they do not last long. Happy cleaning!
5,Easy to deal with.,"After ordering 2 vacuums and only receiving 1, I was easily able to contact the company and have not only my second unit shipped, but they generously compensated me for my time. I would not only recommend using Crucial Vacuums INC, I would say your foolish to use any other company."
5,Light 'n speedy,"So far so good. Great suction for a lightweight model, encouraging for someone who dislikes vaccuming!"
2,Disappointed.,"I bought mine several months ago based on the name Electrolux and the reviews. At first I loved this powerful little machine, but now, I've got to find a replacement. I have stairs and 1 room that is carpeted.But add in 1 long hair cat, and the suction on the vacuum has become kaput on the carpet. Still works well on the other areas of the house though."
3,corporate,"Electrolux Eureka Sanitaire Commercial Canister Vacuum CleanerI have used this product in other of my offices because it picks up paper clips and has a place for a HEPA filter. This product came with a broken wheel. It is plastic and the plastic tab which held the wheel to the machine was broken. Shoplet sent a Return Authorization promplty, however, the part is $2.50 from Eureka and the box a UPS Store would cost more. Shoplet graciously agreed to accept the vacuum in its entirety but unwilling to simply order the $2.50 part. I ordered myself from Eureka. Seemed like a waist of resources."
2,Not happy,"I owned the old mighty mite about ten years ago and gave it away because I didn't think it was being used enough. After I added a parrot to our menagerie I needed a good portable vacuum, so I purchased this unit after much research.It doesn't compare to the old unit for suction or low sound levels. It would be okay for light cleaning or vacuuming cobwebs, but it is not good for pet hair or the clutter surrounding a bird cage."
1,Stay away,"What a useless machine this is: It is sinister how cheaply made this model is, with a motor too powerful for the flimsy plastic container it houses. Although it sucks plastic bags and book jackets like a storm, it fails to remove lint from the floor. While vacuuming, it heated up the room so much so, that on a hot day, I couldn't keep on working after only 5 minutes of it. But the worse was that the plug and outlet were so hot to the touch, that no doubt had I not came on time to unplug it, it might have started an electric fire. It went right back to where it came from leaving me the worse for shipping costs."
2,"Main attachment falls off, hate this vacuum!","I ordered this vacuum because of the great reviews. What no one seems to mention is that the heavy attachment that gets used 90% of the time falls off during use multiple times.The device on the hose near your hand, which controls air flow has pinches my hand because it will close over it.This vacuum is heavy, does not maneuver well, and is my least favorite vacuum since my last Electrolux, which finally died due to overheating.This product is not made for a petite woman. I am being hassled about returning it to the vendor. And the shipping price is ridiculous. I feel like someone stole 100 dollars from my already tight budget.Do not buy this vacuum!"
4,Lots of power but seems a little flimsy,"Bought the COMMERCIAL version of this canister vacuum because it is similar to the last canister vac we had. That one lasted about 6 years and worked well except that the rear wheels both broke just as they broke on the one before that. It was a Mighty Mite I believe. The wife is not that hard on her appliances and only uses them for the house. I am hoping this one will prove to be more durable. However, I noticed that while the Electrolux has plenty of power, the shell of the vacuum is very thin. If you hold your hand over the nozzle while in use, the sides SUCK IN. The extendable wand is metal is seems to be very high quality as are its attachments. The long power cord is nice but is a pain to wind up under the vacuum. Wished it was retractable. Looking to see how well this one compares to the last we had. All in all, I think it will work out pretty well."
4,good vac for price,I like the size and power of this vac. It has done a good job on furniture covered in pet hair. I have no negative comments.
3,Light and do the job,"It is light & easy to move around and does a good job for cleaning floor. The hose attached to the handle an be rotated, not fixed, which makes it easier to manuever the wands. The length of the wand attached to the brush can be adjusted by pushing the button and sliding the wand. The only problem is the wand does not have a clip, like most of other vacuum cleanners, to secure the floor brush and the the upper handle; you need to tighten them together by pushing hard to make sure they do not come apart. It happened several times with me. It is a poor design (3 stars); otherwise, it is a good little vacuum for cleaning the floor."
4,Great little power house,"After a disappointing experience with a bagless canister from dirt devil, I have learned my lesson; If u want real suction power u need a bagged canister. This vacuum looks a little cheesy and it is super light, so at first u may think it won't do it's job. However, once u turn this baby on u will be convinced. I use the extension brush to clean the sofa, furniture and more. I live in a small apartment with my husband, but no dogs or kids. For us it is perfect, because u can get in all the nooks and crannies, underneath the couch etc. If u have huge ground to cover, u may want to stick with an upright. If u are worried about replacing the bags; amazon sells them and I have used the same bag four times. It is not like u have to change it every time u use the vacuum. Buy with confidence."
2,It serves a purpose...,"In all honesty, this book has got to be the single most painfully boring book that I read during the entirety of the coursework that I undertook to earn my history degree. Some historians make better storytellers than others, but this book proves nothing if not that economists make mindnumbingly insipid authors. Granted, there may be some economic historians who can spin more interesting prose - but after finishing this book, I'm not inclined to seek them out."
1,bad buy,"bought this product based on he sizing chart and I cannot fit into it !!! its meant for someone who is a size 10 or 12!! no way u can struggle to get urslef to fit into this thing!! Wont bother returning, anyone buying this product ,pls choose size very carefully!!"
3,Interesting Compilation...,I must begin by stating the pieces are MOSTLY solo guitar. There is a wide mix of styles...not bad. But...watch out for cut 8 on disk one...and cuts 10 and 12 on disk 2....VIOLINS/QUARTETS. That gave me quite a jolt and woke me up. I am going to make a copy with those selections edited out.
1,Weak!,"Very overpriced, given the sparse content. I bought this CD to help me learn the 12-string, Leadbelly style. It's a very old recording of Pete Seeger that has little value for guitar instruction."
3,Why not Thousands Cheer too?,"Since Warners Bros. has the MGM package now why not put Thousands Cheer (1943) in this collection. This was MGM's wartime patriotic entry with most of their stars in it (Judy, Mickey, Lucille Ball, Ann Sothern, Red Skelton, Eleanor Powell) with a slim plot with Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson as the stars."
2,"Warner Bros. Homefront Collectiom - Two thumbs up, one thumb down","I was previously familiar with the three films featured in the ""Warner Bros. and the Homefront Collection"". My reason for the purchase was to add a high quality DVD set that represented the Warners studio contract players during the height of the studio system. "" Thank your Lucky Stars"" {particularly Bette Davis singing her wartime lament, ""They're Either too Young or too Old"") and ""Hollywood Canteen"" were beautifully transferred to the DVD format. ""This is the Army"", the only movie in color, was a great disappointment. The picture was lacking in detail and the color was too brightly saturated and inaccurate. Surely, Warners can do better."
4,Meat Slicer,"Victorinox 10-Inch Meat Slicer performs well for it's price cuts smoothly, and is easy to use. The only downside is that it is very light, so when slicing firmer meats...like refrigerated roasts it takes a liitle more strength and may not be as safe to use."
4,"C'mon folks, it's not that bad?","I read true crime constantly and to the two top ""reviewers"" who put down this book so blatantly....lighten up.The book is interesting enough. I find typos in practically everything that I read anyone. I proofread for a living and I could get through it without so much annoyance. Relax people.What hit me most, was Gwen Graham's childhood. Kids who are brought up around so much violence are always affected.I would recommend this book to the true crime lover. It is not Helter Skeleter but it's a good read."
4,Excellent!!,It's has been a while since read this book but it has never left my mind.It was interesting so it kept my attention.The end result left me wanting to know what happened after their sentence was handed down.This is one I would read over and over.
5,To the reviewer,This book was wonderful! To the reviewer from Australia that was turned off by the book's (grammer) that would be grammar!
5,Need the documentary info,"I enjoyed this book. I have used the information in classes I have taught. I thought the book was well-written as far as suspense, interest, research, and information.I would like to find a copy of the documentary on the case. Can anyone assist?"
2,Poorly Edited Book,"Because I lived in Michigan for 30 years, I thought this story would interest me. It did, but I could have edited it better when I was an eighth grader.From page 1, I found grammatical errors, typos, and poor sentence structure. It was an interesting story that was not enjoyable to read.It seemed to me that the book was just thrown together. The publisher should be ashamed and certainly more considerate of the reader."
4,When the Bears go Camping,This is a great story to get your child prepared to go to camp. A must read.
4,Junky at good price,"I bought this crouton for my husband, being greatly aware of its nutritional values. My hubby loves it when I can't make him any garlic bread to go with his salad. This product can also go as stable snack during emergency/evacuation situations since it is full of preservatives and calories."
1,Triad Wasteland,"I expected so much more from this movie and it just was not there at all. If you just wanted to watch the choreographed martial arts and sword play in it you MIGHT find it somewhat interesting but even that strains credibility for instance when the lead female character pulls a knife out of someone's stomach and there is not a drop of blood on the blade...HUH??? The plot was seriously lacking, the acting was sub par, the characters were one dimensional, the directing was terrible and I cannot imagine why I watched it all the way to the end. Definitely a B movie. Save your time and watch something else, if you must watch it rent but definitely don't buy it."
4,"interesting experimental funky, soulful jazz","Not Harris' best album (of the 20 or so I own, I'd say Mean Greens gets the most time on my turntable, though I also rate ""I Need Some Money"" very highly and ""Swiss Movement"" is wonderful; plus I really love his bossa number, Lolita Marie, on ""Bossa Nova""). But it's an important album for Harris fans because of his use of the electric saxophone and the greater degree of experimentation compared with the relatively straight ahead precursors."
2,Cute for looks,"This pen gets a lot of comments, but the top pieces fall off when you put it in a purse. Then it doesn't look like R2 anymore, so what's the point? But it sure is cute laying on my desk at work"
4,Cute,This was a Christmas present for my young grandson. He loved it! An adult had to show him how to change the top but he had no trouble after that. I would recommend this for anyone who loves Star Wars!
4,great insights,"This was a real page-turner with descriptive insights into John's life by one of the people who knew him best. I am a huge Lennon fan and although I still love his music, after reading this book I've lost all respect for him. I never thought I'd say this, but he's a liar and a hyprocrite. Some of the passages, like the one where he lashed out on his innocent young son, turned my stomach. Cynthia is such a brave and amazing woman, and I'm grateful to her for writing this book so the world can see the truth about the man behind the legend."
3,Growing Apart,If it wasn't about John Lennon we wouldnt read it would we? Yet 2 people are effected by his subsequent martyrdom. Cynthia exposes Johns weakness to us all . Far easier for John to become a marionette with Yoko pulling the strings than be a responsible father. Next time I listen to a beatles song I will remember this dead beat dad with some sympathy for his neglect of Julian. This book sets the record straight with a truth we dont want to hear. In Johns case word's are cheap when it comes to family.
5,A Truthful and Surprising Book,"I went into this book thinking I already knew what it was all about. How surprised I was to learn what type of a person John Lennon really was, behind the facade that he and the media put up. I found this book to be very revealing and really written from the heart by the woman who lived it. I really feel empathy for Cynthia and Julian about what was withheld from them and what they missed out on."
4,Rivetting Insight From a Different Perspective,"This book offers an honest account of what went on from a different perspective often ignored by other previous accounts of Lennon's life. Cynthia writes the book in a dignified manner which gets across some of the injustices and disappointments both she and Julian suffered, but not in a bitter manner, in addition to some of the highlights of the Beatles journey. The book presents further evidence of Yoko's negative influence on Lennon's life and the world generally!"
2,Real life horror story,"You know those movies where a man chases a girl and instead of running into a bright shopping mall or something, she runs down a dark alley? And its like ""Oh no, how dumb!"" I got that feeling lots of times reading this book.I think Aunt Mimi is described well, better than other Beatles books.Also there are photos I haven't seen before. I liked the photo of the letter from John (it is a good photo, you can read it) and a postcard from Paul.But it's not enough. Its the 25th anniversary of John's death, new books need more new stuff than this. 2 stars."
1,Should be called 'Cynthia' by Cynthia Lennon.,"As my title says, this book is about Cynthia, with John mention barely as many times as Paul McCartney. If You are looking for a great JOhn Lennon book, keep looking."
1,Never have your ex write your biography,"Clearly Cynthia Lennon went through an ugly divorce, but that was almost 40 yrs ago. Yeah, John could be a jerk...which of us couldn't when we were in our 20's? The man grew and changed this cannot be said for his ex-wife. This book is bitter, mean-spirited, shallow and clearly shows that this woman had little understanding of John Lennon. Thank heavens he found his spiritual and artistic soulmate, Yoko."
5,the ulitmate band chick book,"For anyone who has ever been a band girlfriend/wife, every word of this book will ring true. It is so refreshing to read about the era and heroes that defined my life from the point of view of the girlfriend/wife. Cynthia Lennon doesn't whine or trash John, she tells the truth as it applied to her and her son. The need to tell the other side of the story and set the record straight is completely understandable.This book was a delightful and nostalgic reminder of life in the 60s. I was pleasantly surprised at how smoothly the writing flows."
3,Just to be complete,"In an era where John (as well as many others) has been reformatted, remixed, repackaged and re-released, that this book should appear isn't much of a shock. Unsurprisingly it is more or less the same as Cynthia's earlier ""A Twist of Lennon"" with a few extra nasties about Mimi and Yoko thrown in. In fact, ""Twist"" is probably a more worthwhile read just because it came first.Cynthia is a sympathetic figure, no doubt, but unless you really want to do the psychoanalysis on her, her kid or her ex-husbands, I say you can give this one a miss. In the end, John was a big boy and was controlled by no one, not Mimi, Yoko, Paul, Magic Alex nor anyone else. John would tell you so himself, if he were here. Because he's not, I suppose this justifies the four and five star reviews you see here."
5,I did not know that!!,"This was a great overview of the real John Lennon and his family and Yoko Ono. I had no idea Yoko came into the marriage of Cyn and John and when John died, Julien got very little and to buy back his fathers things for memories of a dad to a son!! God Forbid! That is completely not right of Yoko...Mumm give peace a change and yet the women and John did not even have peace within there own lives, with there love ones. If Yoko stayed out of there lives, I am sure John would still been married to Cynthia, for better or worse. I really enjoyed this book and I thank Cynthia for writing it as I became part of her life at the time it was all happening. For Yoko, God says in his word that what you sow you shall also reap! So a day is coming that you shall reap what you have done to this family. God only knows the ending!!"
4,Great book!,"Without falling into sentimentality, nor display self-pity, Cinthya Lennon describes his complicated relationship with John Lennon, during the most fruitful period of his career."
2,"Shallow, Insightless, Generic Account of Beatles Story","This book will be disappointing if you're looking for anything other than an account of the Beatles story that's been told many times before. Much of the book is not even about Cynthia or any insights she might have, but a retelling, not even first hand, of aspects of John and the Beatles that any self-respecting fan would already know. When it does go into first-hand account it is as general and vague as can be. For instance when she says Pete is quiet, but George always had a quick-witted reply to John...would have been good to have given at least one example.For a good book about the early years that gives specifics I'd recommend The Man who Gave the Beatles Away by Alan Williams."
1,There is nothing new here!,"I want to start off by saying I am a lifetime Beatles fan and have read 90% of everything written about them. I was always a great admirer of John Lennon and was never a fan of Yoko. I just finished reading this book and I just want to say how disappointed I am. This was promoted as Cynthia finally telling the whole story but there is absolutely nothing new here even for someone with only a passing interest in the Beatles story. Cynthia wastes page after page re-telling well-known stories without even adding the insight that her perspective might hold. The worse part though is the never-ending whining that just gets worse and worse as the book goes on. Poor Cynthia and poor Julian. If Cynthia is to be believed, John is responsible for everything that ever went wrong in either of their lives, including all her failed marriages. Oh, but she's not bitter! Right."
2,Same Old Cynthia,"Yes, there is some new material. But a lot of this content seems rehashed and was covered in her previous book on the same subject about the same husband. It's more a biography of her than it is of him, and who is she? After all these years, Cynthia is still cashing in on the Lennon name of a former husband. Having been remarried at least thrice since then, it's time to Let It Go, Girl. He's Just Not that into You."
2,John & Cyn,"The reason for the poor rating on my review, is not that I found fault with the writing or the story. I did not. I was very disappointed that the Kindle version did not include any of the photos that were such an important part of the tale. Had I known this, I would not have purchased this version. When the author has chosen to include photos, it should be understood that they are important to the telling. The book itself was very interesting, but obviously would have been greatly enhanced by the photos that were chosen to be included."
2,Disappointing coverage of key topics,"This book covers a broad range of topics, some relevant to video and audio coding, some not (e.g. digital filters, Fourier transform, phase locked loop !). Key topics such as motion estimation and compensation are not clearly described. The information on the MPEG standards is disappointing, by my reckoning less than 1/3 of the book actually deals with MPEG. There is no mention of MP4 profiles/levels or MP4 systems."
3,Good for introduction of concepts and nomenclature .but ....,"The last 1/3 of the book serves as a good introduction to MPEG. All of the concepts and terminology definitions, can be found on the web, but it will take you days to find it all. This book is good if you want to save time looking thru useless web pages that may or may not be correct.Worth the money? Depends on how valuable your time is.The first 2/3's is mostly academic principles of sampling/transforms/compression. Engineering text book stuff.Also, the book is very rough around the edges. Looks like a collection of stuff from different sources. The book jumps all over the place, and leaves things open ended at times."
3,Different and enjoyable,"This murder mystery is set in 1912 Oklahoma. It's interesting to read about the farm life of this era via a mystery. I think the characters, dialogue & mindset are probably fairly accurate for the time period. There's a lot of cooking involved in the large family & it's amusing to see some of Alifair's recipes at the end of the book. All in all, a different, enjoyable book."
3,I really tried to enjoy this book,"This book has great potential: great characters, a twisty plot, and a solid mystery but it seems to be slow moving and drags in spots. My attention span wandered when reading the lengthy descriptions. I finished the book (finally) but it was a struggle."
2,OK read,"I'm not sure what I expected from this book. As a man, I expect it will appeal to women readers more than men. The story was OK, but a little contrived and slow. Too girly for me."
3,Another great title,I chose this book because of the title. The story occurs in a rural area where the neighbors help each other. The old buzzard however doesn't want anything to do with his neighbors and they tend to avoid him. When he is found dead of a bullet wound the mystery of who shot him begins.
5,Old Timey Mystery,Rich descriptions of a time long gone. The death of a nere' do well neighbor was almost a welcome relief until mama realized one of her children could be implicated in murder. Never under-estimate the sleuthing powers of a protective mama!
4,The Old Buzzard Had it Coming,"This was a pretty good book, a little tiresome at times but and easy read. You never would have guessed who done it but the ending is the best part."
3,PLEASANT,"I would recommend this book for anybody who is family oriented and knows what it is to stand up for somebody related or close.It had a bit of ""Little House On The Praried"" in it, to my way of thinking, but still had a bit of mystery. From the title I thought it would be more of a comedy type of mystery, but not so. Still worth a good read."
4,The old buzzard really did have it coming!,It kept my interest from the get go.I really wanted to know who did it since so many wanted to.It was an enjoyable quick read.
4,A comfy read,I enjoy who don it reads and I thought this was a nice book It was set back in old times which made it even better for me .If you like easy reading you will like this book.And it was free.
4,More power to Alafair,"Loved this book. While the story is good I enjoyed all descriptions, emotions and events. Hope to read more about this heroine and by this author."
4,Enjoyable read!,"I enjoyed this book, kept my interest to the end. I thought some of the language was out of era....but it didn't detrack from the story in anyway."
3,"Okay read, believable characters, but tediously slow-moving","In 1912 Oklahoma, abusive drunk Harley Day is found dead with a bullet hole in his head, and his son John Lee disappears, convinced he killed his father. But neighbor Alafair Tucker doesn't believe he is responsible and is determined to find the killer.Very slow-moving plot with lots of period detail, it was pretty obvious what secret was going to come to light to explain the murder, and there were some minor loose ends left hanging. But the characters are likable enough, and it's especially nice to see a happily married heroine. Spelling, grammar, and formatting are adequate."
5,"enthralling, amusing great read","This is a great story. The characters become real immediately. Interesting. Smiles. Real life. Surprising, but reasonable, ending. I first checked this book out from the library, scooping up a bunch of new mystery books. I got a kick out of the title. Liked this one so much, I bought it. Looking forward to this author's subsequent books as well. My mother at first refused to read this book (she didn't like the title). Later, after I'd purchased it, she started to read it, became engrossed in it and hardly put it down until finished."
3,tough sponge!,"The only reason why I give this a 3 is because the sponges in the ""carwash"" are so close together and it takes quite a bit of force to push the trains through. Twisting the knob doesn't help either. Otherwise, it is a cheap great knock-off of the more expensive Thomas name brand."
4,A compelling case for ending the ongoing occupation.,"This is the only book I've read of that actually details not only why we should end the military occupation of Iraq, but also how we can get out. The book recommends a complete withdrawal by January 2006, and its recommendations should be taken seriously by our political leaders."
5,"Advocating a military withdrawal by January 31, 2005","Exiting Iraq: Why The U.s. Must End The Military Occupation And Renew The War Against Al Qaeda is the report of a specal task foce under the directorship of Christopher Preble, which was sponsored by the Cato Institute. Observing that the American occupation of Iraq has passed the one-year mark with no end in sight, Exiting Iraq questions the Bush Administration's costly operation, suggesting that America's presence actually encourages a new class of terrorists to rise against the United States, and undermines attempts to bring about political and economic reform. Advocating a military withdrawal by January 31, 2005, Exiting Iraq emphasizes the importance of orchestrating a foreign policy that clearly defines and protects vital American interests overseas without squandering lives or resources."

3,CSHAW,"Not much for a love story. It was not very romantic to me. Nonetheless, I learned a lot of history for this reason it was ok."
3,Enjoyable Read,"This story has a great beta hero in Robert Kerr. I liked him a lot better than Jocelyn. She seemed too modern, too willing to put herself into situations that a real early 19th century woman (a ""lady"") was unlikely to. Bottom line, The Bride ship was an enjoyable read, but could have been better if there was a little more depth to the story."
4,straight ahead,larry coryell has been playing and recording for about 45 years. like john mclaughlin he is a founding father of fusion. coryell has done it all when it comes styles. here he is mod and swinging in a small combo format playing some chestnuts. the c.d. is quite good overall and some cuts are amazing. this is a big slice of of hot guitar playing.
3,Good if you're in the mood...,"Pop Levi has me betwixt and between. Some days I love this album. On others, I can't stand it.This is at times almost bubblegum pop, done very well. There are elements of T-Rex, but also hints of techno. The tracks vary widely in sound and feel, and there does seem to be plenty of evidence to suggest Pop Levi is very inventive. From experience, this is a good party record. If you're in the mood for melody, harmony and meaningful lyrics though, go elsewhere."
3,Path of Glory,"The summary on the back cover of the book was pretty accurate. What a great line. The descriptions were way too sketchy, even the description of Grayson Death in Operation Excalibur was better than this. However we should give this new guy a chance.I give this book a 3 out of 5 because of the details, too many unknowns. Remember 3rd time MAY be a charm.This book talks of any typical allegiance--how it goes right and how it goes wrong. It seemed only fair for the Combine to have the remnance of another clan since the Lyrian Alliance has the remainder of the Wolfs. I am guessing Steel Vipers or the Ghost Bears will fall next. =)"
4,Character-driven action,"Even the best action scenes in the world mean little if you don't care about the characters involved, or if you don't understand the meaning of the conflict. That's not a problem here--well-drawn characters go at each other in battles where the personal stakes are high. The characters draw you in, and once you're in this book, you race toward the climax.The main reason for giving this book four stars is that it's the author's first novel--I need to leave room in case the author gets even better in the future."
3,Decent Battletech book,"Like most new Battletech books it is only decent,the shorter book lengths being forced on the writers. Randall does a fair job of breathing life into the main character. Despite this handycap. I am sure most of these authors wish they could do more. I felt a little suprised by Zane's death. That event should have had more foreshadowing. But I blame the publishers not the author. for my above mentioned reasons"
2,The magic is gone,"The severe blow that was dealt when Michael Stackpole left this series is still apparent. The latest books lack depth of character, plot and intrigue. Path of Glory only typifies this. The protagonist seems destined for a change of heart from the moment he is introduced. The Nova Cat Khan who potentially could be a great new charismatic leader in the Battletech Universe is watered down dissappointingly to say the least. A certain Clan invades the Draconis Combine and it is described as an afterthought. In my opinion, the only reason to read this book is to stay up to date on the Clans."
2,Where is the BattleTech love?,"It isn't here. Ever since Stackpole stopped writing for FASA, the whole BattleTech series has gone down the tubes. Incomplete story lines, unfinished characters, leaps of judgement by supposed rock solid characters, etc. This book is yet another example that the story line in the BTech universe is wavering like a California quake.Without preamble we learn that Clan Nova Cat is the target of every clan, they are seeking its destruction. This was never introduced. You get 3 pages of explaination. Minubo Kurita is adopted into the clan. When did this take place? And on and on. Hopefully the BTech universe will get a pickup some time down the road."
1,Pretty much worthless,"You could not learn Gujarati in a year with this book. It does not teach conversational Gujarati but instead teaches how to read Gujarati script. Even my girlfriend, a native Gujarati speaker, laughed at this book. Very disappointing."
2,Wouldn't recommend unless you're on a tight budget.,"I think this is a decent set for the price, but it's not quality by any means.The instructions with this set are horrendous and hard to follow.My set was missing a table leg. When the leg was replaced I noticed that one of the ""chain"" pieces on for the table was broken. Although I got a replacement leg rather quickly, I gave up on that point with the chain. It looks fine enough without it. The chains, too, are not free hanging, but molded in shape. It didn't appear that they would have fallen into a natural hanging shape anyway.The best part of the set is the glass top. It's got a nice detail on the edge."
3,Boo-yah! It was great!,"I think the greatest rivalries of the NFL can all be summed up in this video. Although it didn't really elaborate on the little intricacies of the teams involved, it did show some of the greatest games. A can-buy!"
5,One of A Kind,"""High Above Courtside: The Lost Memoirs of Johnny Most is required reading for any true Celtics fan. 'The book chronicles Johnny's truly amazing career in a writing style that captures the broadcaster's passion for all sports and love of the Boston Celtics.I found it amazing that Johnny Most was such a huge part of the Celtics that a number of players complained that he never received a championship ring.The authors, Mike Carey and Jamie Most, pointed out various classic stories which few Celtics fans---even the diehard ones---probably weren't aware of.I enjoyed this book tremendously. I bought it because I thought it would be interesting to read about Most's famous calls. However, the book was not just a rehash of his Celtics broadcasts. It was a fresh look at both Most as a person and his relationships with players, refs, owners, fans and his own family.Even the pictures were excellent."
5,JOHNNY WAS THE MOST,HE MAKES HIS MEMOIRS COME ALIVE. HE WAS A FANTASTIC PERSONALITY AND THE GREATEST BASKETBALL ANNOUNCER EVER. LOOK WHAT HE HAD TO WORK WITH. THE CELTICS AND ALL THOSE CHAMPIONSHIPS.I WISH HE WERE STILL ALIVE. THIS BOOK IS GREAT. BUY IT FOR YOUR PERSONAL LIBRARY.
3,It's ok but there isn't 950 pictures,"I thought the book was ok and there were lots of pictures but about 400 not 950 as the other reviewer wrote. I wish there would have been more information, it's mainly a picture book. There's lots of newer dolls but not enough old dolls. Not what I expected. I would have liked to see more background and info on the dolls and characters. It was fun looking through the pictures though. Prices were pretty true, gave a good range."
1,This is still in print?,"It seems a little unbelievable to me that this book would still be in print. It's completely outdated with pictures that look to be about 15 years old and concepts of deafness that go back even farther than that. Being deaf certainly does not equate to being hurt, as Litchfield suggests. The book is absolutely loaded with irrelevant facts that don't fit into the storyline at all and I asked my library to remove it from circulation."
5,The Best Charmed Novel Yet!!!,I just finished reading this book and I was shocked at the ending. It left me in the greatest suspense ever. I have been sitting on my couch all day just wondering what happened. I hope that something happens!
3,soul of the bride in disguise?,i found this book to similar to soul of the bride when pheobe is kidnapped and refuses food but with paige instead. if your a big fan you might be disapointed but if you just want a good read this book is ok
5,This Is My Favorite Book Of The Year !,Phoebe Halliwell has a preminison that there are some bad things going down in the park she and her sisters are at. While saveing the manden in trouble Paige falls for her boyfriend Miach while he's caring and understanding but when he shows Paige his garden his true form comes to life and Paige falls under his spell and turnes against her sisters!!FIND OUT MORE WHEN YOU READ GARDEN OF EVIL.
2,Product Reveiw,"Charmed is by far my favorite television series of all time. But once I started reading the book, I wasn't into it. I still love the shows, but the books are not for me. I prefer watching these witches fight demons in person!"
5,Garden of Evil,This is a great book; makes you feel like you're watching the show. The writing is excellent.
4,Ignore bad Christina cover pic,"I wouldn't bother to ""review"". It's a nice romantic comedy. Dean Cain can't pull off the homeless street hustler aspect of his role, though. The leads have the chemistry they need. The best friends are pretty sharp. If you're unfamiliar with Christina Cox, I am writing to tell you DO NOT form an opinion of Christina's appeal from the DVD cover illustration shown. She is just beautiful with a very individual look- not the model type- but ""real world"" good looks. I cannot understand how her picture, and the whole green DVD cover, got by. She wears her hair long in the movie and wears glasses. Her appearance is unmistakably individual, yet instantly appealing."
5,Good Movie,"Maybe I liked this movie a lot because I think Dean Cain is the sexiest man alive. :-) iT WAS a good movie and kept my interest;although I knew what the out come was going to be... If you like chick flicks and think Dean Cain is the best, you will love this movie! ENJOY!!"
4,Making Mr. Right,I thought this movie was cute. It is not the best romantic movie in the world but enough to make you go Aaah!
5,This tape will keep you fit!,"This tape is definitely for people who are already in pretty good shape. I'm a runner, but had to take a break because of a mild knee injury. I've had to take time off before, and never found a workout that kept me as cardiovascularlly fit as running did. I did this tape for two months, and was able to pick up my running pace and distance right where I'd left off. Now I use it for rainy day workouts. It really gets your heart pumping! I wish Michael Olajide would make another tape, he's upbeat, motivating, and easy to follow."
3,"good idea, but not for everyone","I love Kathy Smith, but this tape was a bit of a disappointment. The workout is great, for a former boxer. The jump rope section is extremely difficult. My calves never hurt so bad- I have stopped using it because it isn't ""fun"" like her other videos. The kickboxing video is an awesome way to get the boxing workout you want."
3,High Impact!,"I really enjoyed working out to this video, although it was a bit too high impact for me. The jumproping sections are very difficult. I do not reccommed this video if anyone lives below you because you spend most of the time jumping! It is a great workout---but be prepared for the intensity level."
4,Intense work out even for those already in shape,This is a great workout and it is very well instructed (as are most of Kathy's videos). The only down side is that it works everything but upper thigh where many of us need it. I have been doing aerobics for 10 years and I was still sore for three days after my first time with this video. Next time I hope she puts some kick boxing moves in and the work out will be well rounded.
5,Toning!Aerobic!Fun!Well Coordinated!Challenging!,"Before there was Tae-Bo there was this video.Kathy Smith combines her outstanding ability to instruct with a diverse group of men and women going through the workout with her, and a professional boxer who gives this workout an authentic boxing feel. The sound and setting is well done and the workout is broken into three sections in order to pace yourself based on your ability. I have enjoyed doing this workout over and over because it is so different and effective. I recommend it to anyone who wants a change of pace in their workout, anyone who has not boxed before (it is such an invigorating experience)and to anyone who wants to tone their upper body, abs and calves! This video is particularly useful to anyone who may be slightly uncoordinated, those who have not yet attempted any of the kick-boxing videos or classes, or anyone with sensitive knees."
3,A real butt kicker,This video was not for me. I've been a stepper for years & thought I'd try something different. I'd read reviews on this tape & tried it...toohard for me. My back hurt for days. I gave the tape to my son & daughter. Several of Kathy's tapes are too hard. She is definately an advance instructor. I thought the guy on this tape was good - just too much for me.
2,A real disappointment,"This is the only Kathy Smith workout tape that I have been disappointed with. If you want a boxing workout, go with Tae Bo or Kathy Smith's Kickboxing workout.The first thing I did't like about this tape is that she doesn't instruct it! She merely participates as the boxer champion on the cover leads the exercise program. The audio/visual display was also awful. Another thing this tape lacks is inspiration and motivation, perhaps because there was no fun in it. :(There are some postives about this workout. One, it's intense and really gets your heartrate up. Two, the jump roping sections are really tough. I consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser and couldn't use a jump rope in this section. It was tough enough ACTING like I had a jump rope in my hand!I was so unhappy with this video that I sold it at an auction 2 months after I purchased it."
3,Good exercise but distracting production,"Overall I think it would be a good work out tape. But I found it very distracting the fast changing pictures, changing color from black and white back to color, using different angles. I couldn't focus. So now this tape is sitting on my shelf unused."
3,very hard,"I absolutely LOVE Kathy Smith and I own every one of her workout videos.I have to say that I don't care for this particular one. The routine doesn't flow smoothly, in my opinion.Try her 'Kickboxing' video with Keith Cooke. I really like that one and it's fun."
1,Disappointment and Boring,"This video is boring compared to the TaeBo workout videos I own. I was looking for another video to rotate days with the TaeBo tapes. Take it from me, this one isn't worth purchasing."
3,Good beginner/intermediate workout,"In my opinion, this is a good workout for someone who has been working out a few months and wants something a little different, or for those who want to build up their stamina. Most of the instruction is actually given by Michael Olajide, Jr. and Kathy is in the background working out. It is cued fairly well and the actual workout is about 30 minutes or so."
2,no low impact,"I was disappointed with this -- somehow, like many of her others, I expected a low impact version -- but there wasn't one.The first section is okay -- learning how to punch and jab -- that's fine for about 20 minutes. Then the rest is about skipping, and while you can do it without a rope, you're still jumping, which is NOT good if you only do low impact! Somehow I missed this fact in the many reviews I read.Also, the camera work is incredibly annoying. I don't need to see smiling faces when I'm working out -- but whole bodies, so I can learn the postures and footwork!"
3,Not For Me,"I was disappointed with this video. I expected it to be more along the lines of tae bo; however, found it otherwise. I did not like the stick and move comibinations and found them too difficult to do. I was also disappointed that Kathy was not leading the excercises, but rather just another participant. I felt the jump rope manuevers were far too long and grossly out of balance with the rest of the video. If you like to jump rope, you will get plenty of it in this video. I like the old Kathy Smith videos better."
4,Great Workout - But Is There Something Less Challenging??,"I've only been a regular walker, supplementing with weights, for many years now. But, I had no idea this tape would be so tough to do!! Not just the soreness, but the jumprope aerobics. After each session with this tape, all I can do is lie there panting on the floor with my face beet red, so weak that I shake when I try to move for 10 minutes!!I've done it now just two days in a row, both times after walking on my treadmill. Today, I started but was so sore, I couldn't go on! I'm hoping that I can build up to be able to enjoy it...Thanks!"
4,Do not attempt this tape if you haven't exercised in awhile!,"This boxing workout nearly knocked me out! I have been doing Tae Bo for awhile now, and before that, I was doing David Gray, Richard Simmons, and the Grind. I can absolutely say that this is the most challenging tape I've ever done. I made it through about half of the jumping rope segments before giving up and pretending to skip rope through the end. The next morning I was sore all over. But I'm still doing it! Bottom line: if you're a consistent exerciser, give it a try, but if you're a beginner, start with Tae Bo or Richard."
4,Off the Beaten Path - no cheerleaders here....,"Kathy Smith (who I usually totally groove on) is superfluous to this video. She is just another class member, which is fine because she is a fitness instructor, not a boxer. Michael Olajide darn fine job, sans Kathy. The tape does take some getting used to. There is a lot of 'tricky' photography and editing, which can make following along difficult, but once you learn what to expect it is a fun and challenging workout. It might be difficult fo beginningers - it is a good supplement to an already active workout regime."
1,Not for me,"It's kind of nice to see Kathy Smith working in tandem with someone else. I did the warm up of this video, which was fine, but when I got into the core of the video, I realized this one was not for me. It included a lot of fast bouncing & movement on the toes, and a lot of jump-roping. My knees were sore from a previous workout, and I knew this workout was going to be hard on my knees & I'd be feeling it as lower back pain that persisted for a few days as well as knee pain if I finished the tape. Oh well. I wanted to like it."
5,You should be this smart,Mainly this book is about three individuals who were antithetical to stupid absurdities. It shows a better understanding of fundamentals than any government ever has.
5,Yummy,Love them and want more! Ordered them for Comic Con and they arrived too late but I think we can blame Hurricane Sandy for that.
5,For the classic Doctor Who fan!,"My son is a big fan of Doctor Who and he is always quoting the 4th doctor ""would you like a jelly baby""...these came across my amazon recommendations and I just had to get them for his Christmas stocking! The look on his face when he found his ""real life jelly babies"" was priceless!"
4,Unusual if you are a gummy bear eater,I purchased these as Dr. Who always eats them so I thought Dr. Stew should give them a try. At first I didn't care too much for them. The outside is close to a gummy bear but softer and the inside is like a thick sugar/jelly substance. They do not taste bad and are made with natural fruit juices and colorants. One thing about them is that I found I ate far less of these per snacking session than I did gummy bears so it might be a good choice for parents. My next try will be wine gums...
2,Not What I was expecting,"I'm sure you've seen the candy on Doctor Who and decided to pick up a bag for a taste of pop culture. Just a warning, if you think Jelly Babies are essentially Sour Patch Kids without the well sour, then you're absolutely wrong. They're more of a larger sort of juice filled chewy candy. What I'm trying to say is they tasted a bit... off to me."
2,"Artifical, soft not chewy, and not so tasty","Given that these have almost exactly the same ingredients as my favorite candy Wine Gums, I was hoping they would be nice. But they taste pretty artificial, and the texture has no chew to it. Fine if you like that sort of thing, but I was disappointed.They are slightly redeemable if you let them sit open for a couple weeks, so I gave two stars. Still, I'll never buy them again; I'll stick to gummy bears and wine gums for my rare candy indulgences."
2,funny texture,"The gellatin is from beef, not goat, which I think explains the texture of them. They are chewy, more of a soft candy, and there is some grit to them."
4,Wanted to see what Dr Who raved about.,"Not bad. Softer than a ""gummy"" product. Flavors were ok but not great. I would eat them if they were around but not order them again."
5,Christmas gift for a Dr. Who fan,These were a Christmas gift for my wife's uncle along with a Dr. Who scarf and they were thouroughly enjoyed by him. Only suggestion is be more clear that they will ship from the UK and need to clear Customs with that added delay - sadly this caused them tonot arrive until after Christmas.
1,Worst one yet...,"I've been reading all of the 'romantic comedies' in this series, and there are the good ones and the so-so ones, but this is so far the only one that I thought was awful. It's so predictable, and most of the things they say are corny. If you want a good one read She's Got the Beat, Ripped at the Seams, or How NOT to Spend Your Senior Year"
3,uh... so-so,"At first I though ""hey, that's a pretty creative title!"" and I realize that's not so. Cupidity is simply cupid's female form's name. No jokes behind it, no hidden meaning. It's okay to read, some parts dragged, some parts are okay. One of those books that's readable, with no deeper meaning, and meant to be forgotten a bit later."
3,Cupid didn't shoot me with his arrows for this book,"Cupid goes into disguise as cupidity and i wont explain all of the details. This is a good book, i have read better. starts of very bland-gets better-gets boring-gets good-gets boring-gets pretty good. This book is not suspenseful and that is mainly why it didnt grab my attention. I love the series of books (Royally Jacked, Spin Control, Hot NOT to Spend You Senior year) in fact the books in the series are my favorite books but this book is not worthy of the series. It is fair but not a book that deserves 4 or 5 stars. 3 AT THE MOST! Tempted to give it 2 but decided on 3 for reasons of detailed description and plot and ideas of the story. Caroline Goode I think could do good in a book with a different plot."
4,"Fun, easy read","I can't believe the average rating for this book on AMAZON is so low. This was a great, fun read. I loved all the characters - especially Cupidity (Cupid in disguise) and the main character Laura. Too often these days in teen novels, the female characters are petty and annoying but Laura was real and sweet if a little dorky (which is okay because I am too). I would recommend this to any woman (young or old) who likes a little romantic comedy fun."
2,cupidity shot by arrow,"This was an OK book. Laura Sweeny is a high school senior who is obsessed with ancient Roman/greek mythology. She is also desperately in love with the 2 most unnatainable guys in school. Mythology lover that she is, Laura goes the old fashioned route to love: Jupiter, send me a boyfriend. What she gets is Cupidity, Cupid in disguise. Complete with bow and arrow, Cupidity turns the school into a love warground, setting up the most ridiculous couples. When Cupidity gets shot with one of her own arrows, she forgets that she is really a he-god in disguise! Its up to Laura to reverse the damage before Cupidity's disguise runs out, revealing him to be the fat little god he is! Can she manage to fix it and find true love?"
2,Going from ok to really bad,"I liked the beginning of the book when Cupid tried to hook Laura up with guys. I started to lose interest when Cupid got amnseia and couldn't even remember that he is a god, mutch less a guy. I lost even more interest when Cupid and Cody acted so ditzy in love with each other and when they shunned Laura. I completely lost interest in the book by the time Laura got Cupid's bow and arrow stolen by these people. I also found the ending to be expected. This really ruined and went against the image of the Gods and how they are supposed to be. Don't really recommend this book to people who dont like people that are so in love that they are all over each other and act dumb most of the time, and if you like the more authentic version of the greek/roman gods."
1,TERRIBLE,terrible book. There was BARELY any type of plot and the characters were shallow and undeveloped. At first I thought the book was going to be some cute teen chickflick but APPARENTLY NOt... i couldn't even finish it at all >< its probably gathering dust on my shelf sumwhere....
5,ELLEN IS GOURMET COMEDY AND BEYOND,"I MET ELLEN, 15 YEARS AGO AT NICK'S COMEDY STOP IN BOSTON,MASS, BEFORE SHE WAS AS A ""MAJOR"" CELEBRITY, LIKE SHE IS NOW....I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL FAN OF THE COMEDY CIRCLE SINCE STEVE SWEENEY AND DON GAVIN WERE HEADLINING THERE. I HAVE SEEN MANY FEMALE COMEDIANS. PLEASE BY NO MEANS DO I WANT THIS STATEMENT TO SOUND IN ANY WAY, BIAS, TO FEMALE COMEDIANS, BUT GENERALLY,EXCEPT FOR A FEW,FEMALE COMEDIANS, AT LEAST THE FEW HUNDRED I HAVE SEEN IN MY LIFE, ARE SUPER FUNNY, HOWEVER, THIS IS ""VINTAGE"" ELLEN DEGENERES ! ELLEN IS THE ""ONLY"" FEMALE COMEDIAN WHO CAN BRING TEARS TO MY EYES, CRYING WITH LAUGHTER! THIS IS A 5 STAR , ALL DAY LONG, COMEDY INVESTMENT WHICH WILL SURELY BRIGHTEN ANY GLOOMY DAY WITH LAUGHTER THAT WILL SURLEY MAKE YOUR FACE SORE...! A MUST SEE ! I'M SINGLE AND I HOPE ONE DAY I CAN MEET SOMEONE AS BEAUTIFUL AND AS FUNNY, OR AT LEAST CLOSE, TO ELLEN DEGENERES ! LOVE YOU ELLEN !!!"
5,Laughed Until It Hurt,I was crying within the first five minutes. Ellen relates to real life situations in the most amazing manner. The funniest stand up I've ever seen.
5,hahahahah,"Ever since my friend and I saw this, we've been quoting it non-stop. If not quoting it, making references to it all the time. It's genius."
3,Short and cute,Not as funny as some of her other routines but cute. I enjoyed it and got the DVD at a good price. Glad I didn't pay more for it.
1,Shamefully below par,"As much as I like Ellen DeGeneres, I realise that her stand-up acummen is not as good as her acting and hosting. She was woefully out of form on the evening of the filming. The lack of humour in her stories is quite disappointing. she tries hard to extract laughs from an enthusiastic audience, but the result is disappointing. The dvd has its moments but they are very few and far between. It was a waste of my money and I intend to sell it.I can't see how anyone could rate this above 2 stars. You'll do well to give this a miss."
2,Just Don't Get It,"Would people find Ellen as funny if she was straight? I give her two stars since she doesn't use the shrieking obscenities I hear from other prominent female comedians, but she just hasn't said anything I find that funny.I thought Rosie O'Donnell had more edge but was only a middling talent herself.But as lesbian talk show hosts, they conquer America.I just don't get it.(And I'm not sexist: I liked Elaine Boosler and loved Carol Leifer)."
5,"Buy this now, don't put it off!!","The central theme/topic of the show is procrastination. We get to hear Ellen's very funny anecdotes about it as she opened and ended the show. (""Procrastinate now, don't put it off"") She also gets to do jokes based on everyday life observations, from the mundane things possible. From one ply tissue paper to automatic flushing of toilets, to the obligatory gay jokes to packaging of CDs and light bulbs to the shampoo commercial, she just gave amusing observations.I like Ellen's comedy because she doesn't try hard to be funny, she is just effortlessly funny. Unlike other stand up comedians who think profanity automatically means funny, she doesn't need that. She relies on good material that is simply funny. And watch out for her facial expressions as they enhanced her jokes immenselyGrade: A-"
4,wish they were bigger,"My 18-month old daughter really likes ""coloring"" in these pictures so I'm happy with my purchase. I just don't understand why they made the pictures so small. They could easily be twice as big without any effect on portability. The set we bought has four connected ""scenes"", each 4.5"" square."
3,Beware this seller,"I was disappointed with this purchase. The pages were whole and legible, but it seems like the book had a ""run in"" with some strong moisture. Many pages were warped and wrinkled (maybe a drink spilled on it), and Math is my daughter's favorite subject. I should have forked over the extra dough and bought the new copy, but since all the other used books have been fine I never gave it a thought. The worst part of this transaction was not the book itself; it was the Owner's reaction to my email to voice my complaints. He DID respond right away, but told me there was no way the quality was ""poor"" and I was wrong. I didn't care for his attitude. Just be forewarned."
5,The Painkillers ROCK!,"Finally some music worth listening to! Love the song ""Goodbye"" from the Crow - Stairway to Heaven. Thanks Painkillers for killing my Pain. You are my Favorite band..!!!"
3,A Good book for ANN,A book to understand the fundamantals and the systems. Useful algorithms to work opon.
1,"watch this book, dont take the answers for granted!",I agree with michel that there are a lot of mistakes in the book. It is good for the questions but NOT for the answers.
2,Proof-reader needed,"Like everyone else says, it's great for questions...not so much for the answers. Even just a proofreading would have been nice. I saw ""sheer"" and ""shear"" swapped three times (e.g. ""wind sheer"" and something like ""due to shear thrust""). The lift equation was presented as a SUM of density, velocity, lift coefficient, and area rather than the product. And the list goes on....But then again, it's great for questions to think about! It might be best to buy a used copy that's been marked with corrections."
3,Limited,"The book contains a lot of useful information. However, unfortunately, some of the author's example questions are simply answered incorrectly. Be critical."
2,Kindle edition,"Just a quick add to the above reviews... I just downloaded the Kindle version as a refresher, and would like to extend my thanks to previous reviewers for the inaccuracy warnings. However, I figured it would still be useful as a brush-up guide.I would like to add another note to the discussion, which is that the Kindle edition is full of spelling errors. ""Camber"" is now apparently ""Chamber"", and instead of leading edge slats, we now have ""slots"".... I would have hoped that Amazon would have been more careful about the editing of a technical book, rather than allowing spell-checkers to run rampant.The book is still worth getting as a guide, but buyer be warned."
3,OK for tech exams - but there are some errors in it,"Good book I bought to catch up on some of the questions you always get, when you have oral exams, and want to explain something difficult in a simple way - this book does the trick.But, lookout for the errors - not all of the information is totally correct - when you simplify things, often the knowledge gets so compressed, that errors are bound to occur."
1,As a FCTI and interviewer,"I can pretty much sum up this ""helpful aid"" in the following words: if you're a ""rote memorizer"" go ahead and buy the book, but you better pray that you never end up in front of me during your interview because the hole you will dig will be painful.However, if you're a conscientious pilot who has done his or her homework you will have expert knowledge in the fundamentals of aviation, which will carry more weight than any ""cheat sheet"" will ever have."
3,Very helpful,"If you want to pass your interview in one of those big major airlines, this book is for you.As a reference book to mantain you in shape it's Ok too."
4,FOR PROFESSIONALS,This book is a great help for pilots interested in developping their skills and to be prepared for screenings in the major companies of the world.
1,Once upon a time it was a great book,"This book was a great book before the advent of DirectX, OpenGL and Hardware-Accelaration triangle. Now it's obsolete. It's about 2D sprites, it's about VGA graphic, it's about WinG, it's about color formats,and it's VERY LITTLE about 3D graphics. Any how if you are interested for clear C++ code, or if you're absolutely beginner with game programming it will be usefull. If I would write this review at 1990-1995 it was a five stars book."
5,TESTEES THE SERIES DVD SET,Hilarious and painfully funny! Too bad it was cancelled! I wish I could have more episodes! Thanks for a great deal on a great product!
4,A big improvement on the DVD,"This was a savage war and few really good docos have appeared on it. This was first released on DVD and I assumed the Blu-ray would just be a technical upgrade. Not a bit of it, it has been substantially re-done with maps and much additional information. This must now be the best available doco on this war and I enjoyed it very much. The sound and picture are excellent considering the age of the material."
1,BAD,"A bad documentary, no logic, no deep insights, just a surface look on this dramatic history....."
5,Bring back the classics-Faerie Tale Theatre!,I loved watching these movies on TV as a kid and still do. I did hear that they are trying to get them on DVD. I hope they do. I would like that very much! I wish more and more kids would get into liking movies like these instead of the ones on now a days. I highly recommand all of the Faerie Tale Theatre movies.
5,Best mixer ever owned,"I would have preferred the higher power of the Professional model, if we could have found it; however, the 325 watts and 5 QT bowl of the Artisan are working out just fine. The bread paddle does a great job of mixing dense sourdough bread. The only problem is reminding my husband to not mix anything for as long as the recipe says because the mixer is so much faster than others. Well worth the high cost (even at great discounts); and we keep ours out on the counter for frequent use."
2,Are you feeling lucky?,"It arrived damaged with patches (~2 sq. inches) of color (black) missing. However, because of the unit's weight, flimsy shipping box, and the location of the damage (inside the storage area) I decided not to return it. I colored the damage with a black marker.If it weren't for the damage I would rate the product 3.5 stars.The product is larger than I expected and quite boxy. It looks more like a small desk than a TV stand. I'm going to remove the legs to improve the look (the doors will still open).Also, I was able to put it together without a second person."
5,Easily captures the warmth of the holiday season!,"I can just put this CD in my player and leave it in all day. My favorite has to be the rich yet soft sound of ""Lo, How a Rose 'er Blooming"". I've seen these gentlemen perform in concert and they have such a soul to their music."
3,Great games missing,It will have been nice to add to this collection of the Titans the great Houston Oilers Games since there's no way you can find the games of the Oilers on DVD.
3,i HATE the titans,"i wasnt gonna get this because im a HUDGE Jaguars fan, and i dispise the titans, but it has the 1999 afc championship in which the jags played in, so im probably will buy it for that reason alone"
3,good stuff,"The quality of the 3 greatest games is acceptable and I did get what I expected, but for an item that was ""in-stock"" it took forever to get. I normally do not use express shipping, but I was needing these DVDs asap so I was thinking it would be a good investment. 10 days is NOT express. I normally receive regular deliveries in less than 7 days. I will never pay extra for shipping again."
2,twin pack of girl baby gowns,They are actually very large i believed that they would be for small children and they really swallowed my baby girl whole
1,I agree--it is junk.,"This TV/DVD misled everyone. It has every flaw possible and now has stopped working. It appears the power supply has given out, what else can go wrong with it? Every owner has named it all."
5,The light at the end of the grunge tunnel,"Ivy is able to capture the essence of alternative college station rock without being tuneless, whiney, and just plain boring. It's a shame that this group doesn't get played on the radio, because if they did, they'd bump pseudo-intellectual indie garbage bands like Goo Goo Dolls, Matchbox 20, and Third Eye Blind straight out of the charts and off radio stations' playlists. It's soft, gorgeous, and melodious without being wimpy. It's fantastic."
4,First album is a little more raw and edgier,"First heard of this band after watching a scene in the ""Something about Mary"" movie. I couldn't tell if the artist was LUSH or STEREOLAB as the lead singer has quite a similar voice. A lot of the reviews say ""Apartment Life"" is the best, but I found that the album was good but a little too moody for me and slower paced. Dominique Durand's voice is very hazy and moody and the faster paced songs on ""Realistic"" create a good balance. Thus, I decided to go for this album, which is their first one and rock's out a bit more."
1,Arafat is smiling,"This video is a tour de force of liberal, left-wing propaganda. It selects the ""facts"" to paint an extremely biased and inaccurate picture of the Israeli right. The self-hatred evident among a few Israelis of the left ""lunatic fringe"" is reminiscent of the anti-American sentiment in our own country during the Vietnam war. If Arafat was really smart - he would tap into his Swiss bank accounts and a buy a copy for every American and European. For one seeking the ""big picture"" - this was very disappointing."
4,Voices for mercy in an era of violence,"This film does not fit into a neat category of good guys vs bad guys. You are given the opportunity to meet several people who live in Israel and deplore the current Nationalist fervor and Intolerance manifest by a small number of Israeli politicals as well as a minority of terrorists from abroad. The film is a plea for dealing with mercy and kindness, rather than setting up an Israely police state. I believe it gives a fair and open hand at the materials presented. It is not the Israel of nostalgia and Children's color books, but rather a vision gone astray."
5,Better than Starbucks!,"The Amaretto is my favorite of all the great tasting Caffe D'Vita products. And I really do like them better than anything Starbucks has to offer, not to mention they're all 99% caffine free."
5,I love it !!!,I really like Cafe Devita. The Amaretto Flavor is my favorite and it is low in calories.
1,Do not get this book,"If you really want to learn bookkeeping, this is not the book for you. First, it is error-filled. Second, the book provides questions in proceeding chapters about areas that have not been covered. Third, the questions are beyond description. Let's just say, based on the poorly-written sections, you will not be able to understand what is being asked. Last and worst, the concepts are not tied together so that the reader can get a complete picture of the entire process. I cannot emphasize this enough: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. If I could have, I would have given this book a zero."
2,Don't get this book,"I found this book repetitive and confusing. No easy explanation was given for which accounts have a debit or credit balance (DEAD CLeRC is a helpful mnemonic), and there are as many examples of using Quickbooks as manual bookkeeping. Quickbooks is popular, but if you want to learn Quickbooks, get the Quickbook for Dummies book!Add in silly grammatical problems and I just can't recommend this book."
1,Not Clearly marked,"Was frustrated to find this is a UK edition, not in book description but visible in small print on cover. Although helpful for UK, feel cheated US$"
1,"Worst ""Dummies"" book ever","So you want to learn how to manage inventory and do the books for it? You buy ""Bookkeeping for Dummies"" and you open up to page 120 and what do you see? Screen shots from QuickBooks! hmmmmm Did I buy ""Quickbooks for Dummies""???? I DON'T THINK SO! This author decided to replace the explanation of how to do the more challenging aspects of bookkeeping with screen shots from QuickBooks. Hey, QuickBooks IS A RIP OFF and THE WORST BOOK KEEPING SOFTWARE EVER MADE!! I wanted to learn how to do the books on my own. Thanks for nothing, DUMMIES! Stay away from this crud and buy a real Bookkeeping book."
2,I needed a simpler system...,This book explains only double entry bookkeeping. My needs are much simpler...a single-entry system will suffice. Eventually I found the information I needed from books in the local library.
4,IT IS VERY HELPFUL,This book contains the basic concepts and helps to understand the world of bookkeeping.
4,Much improved plastic valve,"I've got Champion brass bodied sprinkler valves. When I converted to automatic from manual valves 12 years ago, I bought the plastic actuators, and was disappointed almost immediately - they failed within a year. After a rebuild on a brass actuator didn't stop a leak, I decided to try again, and the valve that came seems to use a much improved plastic. It's a little heftier than those I bought in the past, and I think the plastic is loaded with graphite or something, seems tougher than the old version. I've just had these for a little while, but I'm hopeful I get the same life as the brass ones. There is no issue with fit, they drop right in (although its a little tough to get the anti-siphon lid back on with these bigger bodied actuators)."
4,Time has not diminished her great talent,Vanessa never sounded better!LOVE ITShe's simply one of the BEST!!!A pleasure buying thru Amazon. Makes the process so easy and reliable.
2,She's back but too uptempo,"I believe that Vanessa is a talented gospel singer who needs to stop singing what the record companies make her and stick to her roots as a traditional gospel singer. I was glad to hear she had a new record, but if you are looking for the Old Vanessa, then you will be disappointed. On some cuts, her voice reaches the heavens. But for most of the CD her talents are wasted on songs that do not play to her distinctive vocal prowess. If she MUST go uptempo, then have John P. Kee produce her."
1,I AGREE WITH FELIX,"THIS IS THE FOURTH BOOK BY THIS AUTHOR, THIS IS THE LAST ONE I BUY, IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GIVE ME ONE, I -MIGHT- READ IT. ITS LIKE A BAD MOVIE, YOU KEEP HOPING SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN, BUT NEVER DOES. SAME WITH THIS BOOK, STEPHEN THE DOCTOR, IS A REAL BORE. THE AUTHORS DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SAILS, ETC. ALSO BECOMES BORING, AFTER MANY, MANY REPEATS. SAVE YOUR EYES, AND MONEY, AND TIME, BUY SOMETHING WORTH WHILE."
4,a standard pleasure,"Needing a reliable book for a long flight, I turned to a random O'Brian work. They never disappoint, and The Ionian Mission was true to form. I am about halfway through the series, and am avoiding the sequential order. It's very doable. All of the usual wit and nautical flourishes are here, and most readers will learn a good deal more about the foreign world of early nineteenth century nautical diplomacy and warfare. I was searching for a distinguishing theme in this book, as I seem to recall finding in others; this one was a little more elusive. Nevertheless, I particularly enjoyed to diplomatic intrigue in the Ottoman empire along with the discovery of Bach and the preparation for the Handel oratorio. Better still was the representation of how the foibles of career advancement played out in the British navy."
4,Intrigue and action,"As usual a wonderful insight into life in more trying times at its most colourful. Great characters, storyline and action, although a rather abrupt confusion."
3,The Ionian Mission,Less naval battles and much more background material probably my least favorite story in the series but the material is as usual good description of life in those days.
5,Excellent installment to the series,This book takes 64% of the pages to set up the actual Ionian Mission and does so with spectacular attention to detail.
5,Stellar...,"...but insane. Each track a self-contained sphere, thus constituting in the record a breathless tour of an extremely nether, but often delightful, solar system."
5,GREATNESS!!,"I could not agree more with the previous review. This is light years beyond anything in independent music, or otherwise. In the words of Jad Fair himself, ""We are living in a world that's gone very wrong""--and this album proves it!"
1,biggest piece of junk,"we have this vacum for work and we have all of 4 rugs to vacum. Well it dosent suck, and little tiny pebbles will jam it up real quick, burn the belt and stink. The one rug, all you can see is all the dirt bouncing around as you are trying to suck it up. But, so yea the vacum sucks, but not dirt. Biggest junk ive ever used. Hate it"
1,Sun Visor,They are what I want but not that material. They are scratchy against the forehead - so I gave them to Good Will.
1,Not worth the price! DVD length is falsely advertised!,"This DVD was only 28 minutes long (not 65 minutes as the description states), and the last minute is an advertisement. It includes some decent tips and shows examples to correct issues with straightness, refusals, running out, and rushing, but not $25 worth. It covers bucking and rearing for about 30 seconds.Greg is awkward speaking in front of the camera and stumbles over the script.The DVD also didn't work in any of my computer/laptop DVD players. It would only play on my TV DVD unit. I'm returning this DVD and looking for a good book to supplement my lessons instead."
2,Color Ran,"The jacket is warm, really smart looking, and sporty. My problem is that the yellow dye got all over what was being washed. Thinking all was ruined and had to be replaced was upsetting. Upon rewashing (minus the Marmot FlashpointJacket) the yellow dye came out. Still my whites and light colored fabrics were left dingy. In this day and age colors to run is usually the unexpected, especially, with a product such as this. As a precaution, wash by hand separately and let it hang dry, you still have to be careful with the ""drip dry"" in terms of what fabric you use to catch the drip. Laying down a light colored towel or bathmat would not be a good idea as these will get discolored.I bought 2 of the identical jackets at Christmas time. One as a gift, and the other for me. Learning ing how these jackets ""wash"" was a disappointment, however, wearing this jacket does feel exactly as described."
4,Pleasant suprise!,"It is a little old school at first glance. Then you open it and it is like WOW! The keys are not tiny whch works well with nails. It is a little heavier than what I am use to, but well worth it. Reception is great, Over all, I am very pleased!"
1,Returned it,"This book is about the development of VB apps, not developing the apps themselves. Stuff like how to determine the users needs, and examples of the forms you might use to plan your project. Ummm... where's the stuff on how to write your code? No use for beginners, but app development managers might like it."
3,"All in all, pretty weak","This book would have been better if the author had not attempted to cover so many topics at once. The book waffles between management theory, the history of Microsoft, and actual code. The scarcity of real usable code that is specific to Office is what ruined the book for me. Mostly the book serves as a beginning VB(A) textbook. All in all the book is ok if aimed at someone who is primarily involved in document publishing rather than code or to a true novice developer. It's selling point as 'an updated edition of the successful Developing Applications with Microsoft Office 95' is pretty weak, considering how little code there is in the book actually relating to the Office suite programs. Don't expect to find any object module listing. I would recommend instead Office 97 Visual Basic Programmer's Guide.."
3,Good but very basic general overview.,"If you have absolutely no knowldegeof Visual basic, the Windows API, or programming development, this bood is a good general review. Otherwise, look for more horsepower elsewhere."
5,Wonderful book,Wonderful book about a remarkable family! I wish everyone could read about the Galillean Home. It is truly remarkable and even more so to me after I read both of their books. God has truly blessed these children and all that work with them--especially Jerry and Sandy..What inspirational and selfless people they are.
5,Wabash In Color,"I have owned the Wabash In Color since February 18, 2008. This book is my second favorite color Wabash Railroad book. I especially love the color photographs of the Wabash's Midnight and Wabash's St. Louis Limited on Sunday, September 11, 1960. These photos were taken by Al Holtz. Both photos were in the St. Louis area.[...]"
5,Time ATAC Cleat works fine,"Time ATAC Cleat replacements are exactly as advertised. All machining is precise, and they fit Time ATAC pedals very well. I would order them again when the need arises. Is this 20 words yet. I don't have any more to say."
2,Quick ship - oarts missing.,"Product came with box in poor condition. When opened, found that metal legs were missing. Called mfg. who quickly shipped out the legs. A bit of a hassel with a good outcome.Cart is really handy too use."
3,Poor Packaging,"We were disappointed when the package arrived; parts rattling inside. Once opened, we found good instructions; however, several small parts (nuts, cotter pin, etc.) were missing; axle did not have one of the required predrilled holes. I called Precision; they were cordial and are sending replacement parts within 2 business days.The cart design appears to be quite good and I'm hoping it will be a worthwhile addition to my garden equipment. Won't know until the parts arrive!"
3,Cheap decoration,"It's a cheap decoration for a pirate's costume, not very sturdy and not realistic, but could be painted, I suppose. Good for the price (2.52)."
3,Not the goriest film ever made,"First of all, they'd like you to believe this is the goriest film ever made. Not even close. That title belongs, and probably always will belong, to Peter Jackson's (yeah, the same guy who made Lord of the Rings) Dead Alive. The gore in that movie is so extreme it actually becomes comical. Nor is this the goriest film in the Italian cannibal movie genre. I have to give that one to Cannibal Holocaust. And sadly enough, I don't even think this is the goriest film by director Umberto Lenzi. I think Eaten Alive A.K.A The Emerald Jungle was grosser. So, for my money, this is a pretty good pasta land chunk blower, but far from the best. I give it three stars."
4,Good extras for a good movie,"The DVD is good for its extra features though the commentary by the director Umberto Lenzi is sometimes hard to understand because of his english level.When you see it for the very first time, it is really disgusting specially if you think that all the animal killing scenes were actually shoot without any special effects. Scenes like those nowadays would be forbidden to do.I can conclude saying that if you are a DVD collector, you should buy this DVD uncut but if you are looking for a masterpiece, you are probaly looking at the wrong title."
3,Gore Fiends only,"Well here we have it. Umberto Lenzi's Cannibal Ferox on DVD. This is definatly one for gore fiends only. There are some scenes were the gore is used quite nicely, but unfortunatly they are pretty spread out and you have to watch the [stuff] in between. Also, what is the deal with killing all of the animals? Yes, I will warn you, many cute and furry animals gave their lives for this film. The extras on the DVD are pretty good. You get trailers, bio's, commentary, and all sorts of other things. Mine even came with a mini poster. So if you are into gore and don't mind the cruelty to animals than you can probably appreciate this film."
3,Cannibals that have very little bite,"I was so excited to finally see this lost movie, only to be let down. I mean, it was fun to me, but all the hype really almost ruined it! This is no classic, and actually, it is rather slow at first, but the music is a hoot and the gore is plentiful. I like Todd Sheets and Peter Jackson much better, and you can tell this movie influenced both of them. But really, with a title like this, you know what you are getting into and it is a great package with a poster and a lot of extra stuff, much of it I have yet to find time to see!Good transfer helps, but this one can't decide if it's an action or a horror title and that is ultimately what hurts it to me. But the actors are all good and the effects work is pretty great for how old this is. I have seen much worse than this. And much better."
4,Italian Cannibals and cocaine,"Lenzi's cannibal masterpiece is a tribute to the video nasty generation. It has plot and it has a reasonable amount of acting. I prefer 'Holocaust', but this film is a must for true hardcore fans."
2,Rent It First,The hype that surrounds this movie is way too high. The acting sucks and the FX are terrible. The popcorn I ate while watching this were really good though.
1,Bad,"This movie was just bad! Bad acting, bad special effects and bad direction. I wanted to see something diffrent, something that would shock me or gross me out and went with some of the reviews and was disappointed when I saw this junk."
1,i gave it 'one' star because there's no 'zero',I felt so stupid watching this DVD. It says on the cover that this DVD is banned in 33 countries. Do you know why? because it's a stupid movie.
1,Idiocy,"- Why people make these kind of movies is a question that suits Area 51 well... Canniball Ferox has no plot, no acting and really grotesque scenes (wich was the best part of the movie)... These kind of movies gives europe a bad reputation... Stay away from this... film... at all cost!Could only be less enjoyable if the VHS/DVD squirted acid in your face..."
3,Cannibal Ferox is no Cannibal Holocaust but it still contains quality cannibalism,Cannibal Ferox is a very watchable cannibal movie that's best viewed after first watching Cannibal Holocaust to get you in that monkey brain eating and giant turtle snuffing kind of mood.As far as cannibal movies go Cannibal Ferox is near the top of the list but that's still like being one of the senior janitors in charge of hand scrubbing toilets and urinals.There were a bunch of cannibal movies made in the late 70s and early 80s and the world's top scientists may never know why.This movie contains a human castration scene that looked real enough to make me shun all my cannibal friends.
2,lame,Cannibal Holocaust was the inspiration for Cannibal Ferox. The former is OK with decent acting. The latter is lame.
3,"A matter of taste, to coin a phrase.","People either love or hate the cannibal subgenre, but if you love it or are just trying it out, ""Cannibal Ferox"" is one of the two films that you should watch. When all the debating is finished, the acting, art direction, writing - none of these things are terribly important in these films. They are a series of extreme gore setpieces, period.A word of warning: be wary if buying this DVD from marketplace merchants, because there is at least one who is actually selling his own ""version"" of this film, which is a no-frills DVD, no extras, different artwork, etc. If a different version is mentioned in the comments, or the title is actually the AKA ""Make Them Die Slowly,"" avoid it."
2,Not for DVD aficionados,"I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD. Grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000, without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade. This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now."
2,Those poor cannibals,"Be advised, this film has scenes of not-actual cannibalism and not-actual acting, scripting, and directing. Nothing really happens in the movie until it's almost over, except for some poor beasts getting savaged by other less-poor beasts. Go see Cannibal Holocaust or Jungle Holocaust or some other movie with Holocaust in the title. They're much better than this lame coprolite of a film."
5,excellent!!!!,"I don't care what Eli Roth says about Cannibal Holocaust - this film is by far superior. For what it is - this is the best of its kind. I remember renting it as a teenager with my best friend from a suncoast video store (we didn't even need a parent to rent it, mind you) and we were blown away. If you want more details - read on one of the many reviews listed here . . . awesome, check it out!"
2,That other cannibal movie....,"This is more of a ""gorehound"" film, in that the dialogue is cheesy along with the gore, so you can laugh it off. You can't do that with Cannibal Holocaust, which owns this genre's a**, so to speak. I've seen this film twice, and the first time, it's kind of effective. The dubbing and acting are terrible, but there's a sense of doom to the film, and the gore is pretty intense. But after seeing the 2nd time, and seeing Cannibal Holocaust, Ferox isn't as good as Holocaust, and the flaws it has are more apparent. If you want a cannibal film that really doesn't make you think or challenge you, take this one. If you want a visceral, unforgettable experience with a cannibal film, rent Cannibal Holocaust."
3,Grumble in the jungle,"Although it's great to see this movie uncut on DVD and some effort has been made with the extras, the picture quality itself leaves much to be desired.I know the movie is more than 20 years old, but taking into account Shriek Show can manage wonders with titles like Burial Ground and Zombie Holocaust, Grindhouse have fumbled the ball here.For real gut-crunching cannibal 'fun' I recommend Cannibal Holocaust - which is available uncut, widescreen,with trailer, interview with the director and issolated film score from Substance DVD in America."
3,banned in 31 countries but y,all right i waited so long to get this movie and when i got it it was sorta a let down.I expected i tto be a lot more gory and be more fast paced. If i didnt wait so long i prolly would have givin it a better grade but since i did i expected more. I would still recommend this film for fans of cannibal movies but i feel that eaten alive aka the emerald jungle would be a better catch. Still ferox has its good points it gives a fare share of violence and gore so if ur willing to pay go out and pick it up.
4,cannibal ferox,"this is a good moviebut meny of the efektsare bad. i would sujest cannibal holocaustdo not import it from amazon.co.ukit,s a little under 6 min cut out of it."
3,"Cannibal Has Too Much Hype, Very Little BIte","I was in my local DVD trade store one day and I found a copy of 'Ferox' rather cheap. I always wanted to see this movie, but was told it was <<<THE>>> ultimate is grossness. Well needless to say, I was a little disappointed. Yes, it is a little gross, and even in bad taste, but in no way was it the ultimate cannibal tale. People, please! Even ""Hannibal"" was more vicious. After all the hype what really was left? A slow moving cheapie that uses shock value in replace of real scares, thrills and chills. A tired old wives tale of explorers getting lost, getting eaten, and getting found all chewed up. No real scares, nothing new to see. There are some mildly moody moments, and it is worth seeing only to say, been there-done that. The real downfall of this film really is you don't care about the characters much. Some aren't really likable at all."
1,Awful,"""Banned in 31 countries"" is what got me to buy it. I want to know which countries actually banned it. Cannibal Ferox is in my top 3 of the worst movies I have ever seen. Yeah it was cool when they hung the blonde up on meat hooks by her breasts...but man was it bad. Don't waste your time on Cannibal Holocaust either...it's equally as bad."
5,One of the best cannibal italian films ever,"There are two cannibal films that are guts to the wall and just these two only that are worth watching. This one and Cannibal Holocaust. This film is brutal because of the real animal torture and killing, which is hard to watch for viewers of animal lovers, but thats the reason it was banned in so many countries. If your a gore and splatter genre horror fan then this one is for you and will not dissappoint. I saw this film when I was about 15 years old and it definitely left a lasting impression and I am sure it will on any one else that views it. Happy nightmares."
2,Why the hell was this ever banned,"The cover of this movie states that it was banned in 31 counties. I want to know what countries. There is pretty much no reason why this flim should of ever been banned.I did slightly enjoy this film but it was not what I was expecting. I went into this film thinking it was going to be an awsome gore-fest, but I was wrong. Sure there were a few good scenes for all gore lovers to enjoy. Like the hooks through the boobs or the guy getting the top of his head sliced off and his brains eaten. But it is not worth sitting through a lot of boreing dilouge just to watch it. The actors in this film seemed to be slightly retarded, like if you see a dead body in a village of cannibals, why the hell would you decide to stay the night with them? Your just asking to be eaten."
3,not realy the ultimate cannibal film,"while being a very harsh and cruel viewing experience cannibal ferox is streets away from the power and sheer visceral impact of rugero deodatos cannibal holocaust. that is the ultimate!! having said that however,this disk worth adding to your collection,lots of extras and a pretty good print more than do the film justice. even though its not my favourite ,id still recomend it."
4,For what they have done... Make them die slowly,"Graphic and Disturbing it may be, but may still be praised only by hardcore fans of Italian gore cinema. No one really watches a cannibal movie to be touched, or moved (maybe a move to the bathroom or kitchen sink), but to see graphic violence. Cannibal Ferox... banned in 31 countires, sure does deliever the goods on the gore front. Plot: basically ripped from Lenzi's previous cannibal epics. Acting: since this is a low budget italian cannibal film, that term is used loosely. All in all, if you're a fan of extreme cinema and italian horror, you'll like Cannibal Ferox. If you are a fan of Scream or I know what you did last summer, you will hate Cannibal Ferox. Simple as that."
3,"CRUELTY, NOT ENTERTAINMENT","This is quite a good film, although the special effects let it down- it's definately not in the same league as Cannibal Holocaust. Don't watch this film expecting to be disgusted, because you probably won't be, but it is enjoyable, and John Morghen is a cool actor. However, I thought that the scenes of animal cruelty were unacceptable- torturing and killing animals to provide entertainment is indefensible. By the way, did you know that after the scene where the anaconda ate the little mammal thing(Ican't remember what sort of animal it was), the film crew cut open the anaconda and saved the mammal, though for some reaon Lenzi wasn't happy that this happened."
1,make them die slowly ...,"this movie was boring. the only thing really shocking about it is how the ASPCA didnt sue the ... out of them. it clames to have so many scenes of graphic torture and what not, but they neglect to tell you that 2/3 of the abuse is done to the animals. the only reason i gave it a rating at all was due to the fact the the actual scenes that involved the slaughter of a human looked pretty real, other then that it was a seditive."
1,Junk. . .,"Cannibal Ferox, the classic cannibal romp that ultimately fails in almost every aspect imaginable, is considered by many to be the ultimate gore film. I thoroughly disagree. Cannibal Holocaust, though not as gory, is many times more realistic and could be described as a great film in my book. It actually had a purpose, whereas this film does not. Good gore effects and DVD layout tempt me to give 2 stars, but they really do not add much to an otherwise worthless DVD.For hardcore gore-fans, I actually suggest you purchase this DVD! But for those looking for a good gore-film, look elsewhere *(The Beyond, Cannibal Holocaust, Dead Alive, Evil Dead, and Dawn Of the Dead are my primary recommendations)."
2,"to much bark, not enough bite.","i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it. i heard that it was the most violent film ever made. i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better. i was dead wrong. cannibal ferox is a boring, unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation. im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in 31 countrys. the few gore scenes are pretty effective, but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws. if it was for giovanni lombardo radice[one of my favorite italian horror actors] starring in it, cannibal ferox would only earn 1 star."
1,Boring as hell,"Cannibal Ferox is a real sorry case of movie making, boy does this director stink. Italian horror directors are not exactly the Romero's or Raimi's of this world and this crap movie is proof, well truth be known a lot of crap Italian horror movies prove this. Take away all the animal cruelty out and you'd be left with a big steaming pile of s***. Cannibal Ferox is only for those who feel that this pile dooh was screwed out of an Oscar nomination for best foreign film."
1,What's The Point?,"I question the purpose of this movie. It is gore scene by gore scene a clone of the amazing movie, ""Cannibal Holocaust"". When directors set out to update or enhance a true original, they either fail or fail miserably. (Go see Texas Chainsaw Misery, Take 2) Newjacks to the extreme horror category might be taken back by the over the top visuals but this movie is still a crappy remake. At least Cannibal Holocaust is trying to make a point .... a nasty one, but a point never the less."
4,Does the trick but there is a better choice,"I have used this item for years.http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000VQBYTE/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=luv2globetrot-20&camp;=0&creative;=0&linkCode;=as4&creativeASIN;=B000VQBYTE&adid;=1RQSFR5E00MA9SF6GTF2This was a little cheaper so I tried them, while you never know what is going on deep in your septic tank they seem to work as well as any other treatment, to me it comes down to ease of use. For this item you have to open the pouch and pour it in, for the item I linked to above, you just throw the whole pouch in and it dissolves in the bowl."
4,Good Product-Good Price,Been using this product for 12 years with never a problem. My local home improvement center does not want to stock it anymore so I thought Amazon could be a good choice to purchase it. The price was much better than I had been paying. Very satisfied!
2,my review,"Not useful at all.This book is seriously outdated; most of the pages are spent displaying pointless 3d graphs that are almost meaningless, one after the other.The only useful thing I found in this book was about doing ifft2 in MATLAB but that was about it.If you are interested in the optics, or the fourier transform, look elsewhere."
5,Wow!,Peter Sellers is THE best comedian (and actor for that matter) of all time. I have seen almost all the Pink Panther movies of his and they are hilarious!
3,Thanks,I enjoyed Clouseau as always. I was glad to add this DVD to my collection. Theservice was also good.
5,"hilarious movie, slap stick genius!","From the beginning of the movie clear through to the end, this movie is just one laugh after another. Comic genius Peter Sellers and the supporting cast are brillant! Long after the movie is over you'll find yourself giggling. If you like a little slap stick along with wit and charm and, well ok, a bit of silliness, you will enjoy this movie. Not a fabulous plot, but OMGosh, if you want a good laugh, this will keep you going for a long while. Enjoy!"
4,Funny Film - Great Buy!,This is a great comedic film! The seller shipped item quickly and communication was good. Item arrived quickly as well.
4,Great Film!,"Peter Sellers returns in this classic comedy. Dreyfus is more insane than ever! Considering the fact that he just got out of the insane asylum! The fight with Cato and Clouseau is the funniest Clouseau fight I've seen yet! But there is a few problems, in the near end Dreyfus disappers into thin air, yet he returns in ""Revenge of the Pink Panther,"" alive and well! The movie also drags in the middle, then it picks up again. If you forget those parts you'll rate it 5 stars. I also thought the scene with the President was hilarious. The line he said was, ""Call the FBI, the CIA, and the pentagon! Find out who won the game!"""
4,"""What kind of bomb was it? The explosive kind.""","Simply marvelous and really funny. From the stunningly and witty animated title sequence (with spoofs to King Kong, The Sound of Muisc, Alfre Hitchcock Presents, Batman, Singing in the Rain, Dracula and the Buster Keaton movies) you get the picture to what a great movie it will be.Best Sellers in a Blake Edwards movie. We get to see him in an laugh out loud hunchback disguise with an ""inflatable"" hump.It can also be considered the prequel to Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove as they talk about the Doomsday Machine."
3,"Sweet voice, Boring tunes?","Hal's lead singer has a sweet voice but their song writing abilities leave a little to be desired. After a while one realizes that these songs are boring mostly, a little too ""mushy"" to be taken seriously. I liked a lot ""Fools by your side"" for it brings so many bad memories of people I very much should have left alone (I do not put myself above in that list, I am sure that at one time or another I was a fool to someone!) and I love ""Keep love as your golden rule"". After that, it is a lukewarm affair with no more impressive moments. Want to know a secret? Try Aberfeldy's ""Young Forever"" and delight yourself on a magnifecent CD. What I was hoping for with Hal is to find a band that not necessarily delved into the darker side of songs but quite the opposite. They did not deliver and I thought they would. Too many CD's end up being kind of mediocre, rare is the time when one CD is so good that you get tingles all over just by owning one. 3 stars at the most for Hal's ""Hal""."
4,Amazing fragrance!,I love this perfume! It's quickly become my favorite summer fragrance :). I didn't give this 5 stars cause unfortunately the scent wears off quickly :( but I still love it.
1,"Pretty bottle, but very weak EDP Spray.","This edu spray was very disappointing. The initial fragrance was nice and light but it faded away very quickly. I think it lasted about 2 hours, which tells me that it is watered down.The shipment was very quick though. This was the first time I have ordered perfume on line and I will not do it again. I believe it's better to buy fragrances at a store."
5,Excellent every day knives,"These knives are great! I use them for cutting everything (not just steaks) and they never let me down. I do abuse these knives and throw them in the dishwasher, and after a year of weekly dishwashing they are still as good as ever. My biggest beef would be the plastic handle. While the grip feels great on these things, I have two complaints. (1) Because of the contoured grip, these things won't lay flat in the drawer, making them messy to store. (2) I've already melted part of a handle by accident. Given the circumstances of the accident, a wood knife would only have been cosmetically charred, but the plastic handle is now sharp on that knife. The accident is still my fault, and I am just being nitpicky. The blade on this thing is great and the handle is comfortable, and those are the characteristics of a good knife. If you care about performance, then this is this is the steak knife set for you."
5,Great sharp knives,"These knives are so sharp and trustworthy, that I bought a second set. My highest recommendation. I use them as paring knives and steak knives. They wash nicely in the dishwasher."
5,Incredible bargain !,"If you want a steak knife that is practical and gets the job done these are for you ! I love mine. I was afraid they would be flimsy, but they are not. I am very pleased with mine. I have a whole block of these knives and love them all. Recommended by Cooks Illustrated with good reason!"
3,Sharp but cheap feel,"These knives have sharp serrated edges and cut produce and meat well. Don't know how well they will hold that edge, though. I was disappointed with the cheap feel of the plastic handles. My wife bought a set of knives with more variety including a wooden storage block from Macy's for about the same price as these, so that was a much better value."
5,Great knives at a great price,I purchased a set of these knives about 10 years ago and they still perform as advertised. For the price I can't imagine that you can find a better utility steak knife. They are not fancy but they stay sharp and are dishwasher safe.
5,"So impressed, I ordered more...","I purchased a ""six-pack"" of these knives about 6 months ago. I was so impressed, I just ordered another pack of 6. They are very sharp and are great for everyday cutting tasks around the kitchen. The reason I ordered more was that I got spoiled. Anytime I would go to the drawer to grab a sharp knife I would look for these new ones vs. our old ones. I found that these new knives were always in the dishwasher because everyone would use them up first and leave the old cheapo's in the drawer. We use them for everything....a great paring knife and anything else for which you need a knife this size.UPDATE: I just ordered my 3rd set (3/11/12) of these knives. I'll be using the latest set at my vacation home. The original sets bought over 2 years ago are still as sharp as the day they came out of the box."
5,Excellent,"I'm the only one in my house who hasn't been cut by these knives (of course I'm the only one who doesn't cook either - lol). These knives are much sharper than a standard Steak Knife so treat them with respect, or suffer some blood loss ;-)Bottom line, excellent knives... Sharp, diswasher safe, cheap."
5,Good steak knives,"These are great steak knives for the money. They are a little lightweight, but are very sharp. My husband loves them."
3,OK if you like cheap,So I ordered these knives because most other reviews said they were sharp and over all good.I will agree the sharpness is good but the overall feel and look of these knives is cheap.I wish I would have bought the cheap ones at Walmart instead.
2,cheap feeling,"I thought being chicago cutlery they would be very nice. When I opened the package they feel very cheap and I dont think they will last very long. I didnt try them because I bought them for a christmas present, but I am not sure I will give them to whom I bought for."
1,too expensive,this set is too expensive for what you get. Other equally prestigious brands offer better knives for the same or even lower price
1,Cheap plastic knives,"Based on the five star reviews, I quickly ordered this steak knife set. After they arrived and I had a look, I was surprised by these stellar reviews. Really??? While the blades may be great, the plastic handles make them look cheap, and I would never put these out on a table as a steak knife. They look like something from a dollar store. I sent them back today."
2,"inexpensive and sharp, but that's all they have going for them...","these knives are very sharp and will do the job, but the very lightweight cheap plasic handles are overly bulky and the plastic they're made of is slick and won't stay put on the edge of a plate, so the entire knife slides down into your food getting the handle messy, or it slides off the edge of plate completely and makes a mess on the table. Not a well thought-out design."
1,"Cheap, Flimsy Knives","I knew from the price that I would not be getting top-quality steak knives, but I was swayed by all the positive reviews. That was a mistake.These knives are the cheapest-looking utensils I have ever seen. The handles are made of what appears to be hollow plastic that weighs nothing at all. The blade is unbelieveably thin and wiggles back and forth. Even the cutting edge is not that sharp, except for the point, which is like a needle. They are packaged so poorly in their own box that during shipping all of the knives shifted and were poking through the cardboard.I would expect to see these in the dollar store--that's how bad they are."
1,A very bad Shostakovich violin concerto performance,"Miss Sonnenberg performance of Shostakovich Violin concerto n.1 is one of the worse I have ever heard.Just listen to the third movement, Passacaglia, how slow and artificial is the phrasing. In all the concerto there is a poor sound in the lower strings and, as frequently happens with young violinists, a sforzando on the higher strings.The last movement is a confused race towards the chaos.Better going back to David Oistrakh and Aldo Ferraresi performances and forget about this."
3,Very good for beginner,"This book is very good for beginner, as it mentions all the basic and foundamental concepts and mindsets in selling. However, as a product of MDRT centre, I am expecting more. I am expecting some more in-depth insights or inspirating ideas for the sales who is in average but wants to increase their business to MDRT level. Frankly specking, I am quite disappointed when I found out that this book contains mainly foundamental concepts which are not distinctive and which I have heard about from other sources (remember, this book is from MDRT centre, not other ""average"" writers)."
3,Doll packaging box,The doll was received in perfect condition but from speaking with my niece last night (she received the doll as a gift) the box was a mess and had to be thrown away. With collector items the box is always kept and in this case couldn't be. I will not buy from this seller again. 2 dolls were bought at the same time from 2 different sellers (not Amazon and BOTH boxes were a wreck). This package was from Phoenix Treasure Box. Too bad. Best to be sure product is coming from Amazon and you won't have a problem like I did.
4,I say!,"The mysteries being written for children are a tad easy to figure out and the language is a bit too jolly for me. Nearly every other sentence uttered by one of the Five Find Outers contains an ""I say--"" which is as bad as the Hardy Boy's over use of ""golly."" Nonetheless, a very enjoyable read."
2,"Great read, but there's more to the story","Hard to rate this now. It was a 5 star book when I read it. But after travelling to AK and actually meeting people who know Leo, I find myself very disappointed. Suffice it to say he is a bit of an exaggerator. Like- didn't really climb Denali alone. Had a lot more help than he admits. Treated Melissa poorly at best. Having thus lost respect for him as a person and author, the book becomes less inspirational. But, it got me to Alaska, and Alaska itself kept me here, so that's worth a couple stars right? : )"
3,HollywoodMusicals,"Has its moments in a few of the OLd ONes..But I do love the Music in Most.One Happy 82 year Old whos seen many musicals, and have loved them All.."
3,hollywood musicals,If I had been aware of the contents of these DVDS I probably wouldn't have ordered this set. There are too many duplications of other sets that I have. If ths your first purchase of vintage musicals you will probably be satisfied with the ones included.
4,MR. McMASTER DOES IT AGAIN...,"Quite frankly, I cannot stand the remastering job done by Mr. Ron McMaster on this one... Go figure out why BLUE NOTE has got this man as one of the people in charge of such a difficult mission. Really, whenever I see the name 'RON McMASTER' on cd reissues I get nervous, I would say even deppressed... For those of you who do not know his 'work', go listen to the almost unlisteneable - not the music though - GRACHAN MONCUR III or ELVIN JONES MOSAIC BOX SETS...PLEASE, GET A JOB, MR. McMASTER!"
3,what do you do when two bears get in a fight?,"This book reminds me so much of my family, one day you'll be nice and the next you're picking at each other non stop!this story is so fantastic because it's realistic and it happends to everybody! Brother & sister bear always get along but not today they're picky, sister bear takes too long in the bathroom and brother bear wont sit with sister bear on the school bus! but how does mama and papa bear stop them? read it and take some advise!"
5,This book is sooooooo COOL!!!!!!,This book really taught me about fighting with my sisters and brothers. It was so good. Sister bear and Brother Bear are the coolest book characters! I could not put this cool book down. I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A great lesson!,Brother Bear and Sister Bear are in a big fight. They are not speaking to each other and if they are they don't say anything nice.This teachs kids how even if you and a brother or sister are fighting how to work through it. It is a great book for kids!
5,A gothic in the classic style!,"I grew up reading gothics and love them very much. The House in Thornton Wood has all the elements of a great gothic, and Anne Knoll has a great writing style and sense of the genre. It has the right amount of suspense, supernatural, and romance. The heroine, Olivia, is caught between two very different men while she is on a collision course with her unknown past. The secret of the house in Thornton Wood is gradually revealed in a manner that draws you into the mystery without revealing too much, too soon. Excellent book that I could not put down. The Candlelight series has revived the gothics in a powerful way."
4,It was what I expected,"Although the Cd had smudges all over it, the CD was in great condition without any scratches."
3,There is better,"This book really does little to help parents protect their kids. Personally, I prefer a book by Keith A Schroeder called 'Life and Death on the Internet'. Mr Schroeder provides solutions that work and less time on complaining about the problem. We all know the problem is there, now let's do something about it."
2,"Important subject, but amateurish writing.","A rather amateurish collection of tips that one might just as easily find in a newspaper article on internet safety. This is a very important subject matter, and hopefully in the future there will be books that are much more comprehensive on the topic, as well as more up to date."
4,This deck is gorgeous!,"The artwork in this deck is stunningly beautiful, and Stevee Postman obviously spent a great deal of time on each image. The deck is based on the arrangement of the cards in the Thoth tarot deck by Aleister Crowley and Freida Harris, so if you like that deck you should like this one. Although the nude images were a bit startling at first, the symbolism of the cards matches reasonably well with the Crowleyan ideas.The only thing which prevents me from giving this deck a full five stars is that the interpretations given for the cards are so bizarre and ""bunny-huggerish"" that it makes it difficult to read with this deck. As a reader, I am not inclined to use the Crowley deck anyway, and the curious meanings given in the book which accompanies the deck are utterly devoid of any practical guidelines to interpretations. Despite this shortcoming, the deck is worth the price simply for the artwork alone."
5,Cosmic Tribe Tarot,I love this deck and give it as a gift to everyone who doesn't already have it. It's amazing.
3,Good for the price,"I had a hard time replacing my old, beat up small stockpots and was thrilled when I found these. They are really nice for the money, but a lot lighter weight than the old ones. The only disappointment was finding that the knobs rusted after I washed them. I washed them by hand when I first got them but when I pulled one out to use for the first time, I saw that the knob was rusting where water had gotten under it. I just ordered new plastic knobs for the whole set. Now I will be able to put them in the dishwasher, too."
3,OK,"This book is pretty boring, with few interesting parts. The one redeeming point is the chapter dedicated to Tales from the Crypt. E.C. RULES!!! VIVA LAS VEGAS!!!!!"
5,"Monsieur Gauthier, shame on you!!","Your sentiment is the reason why all music ""sucks"" today. Especially hip hop. I love hip hop so I stick with the madlib's and flying lotus's. Go ahead and dig into some archie shepp, pharoah sanders and then move across the aisle to some captain beefheart and henry cow. Then keep going way, way out. Trust me. It's good for your soul..."
5,"Humor, Suspense & Sex","One word....Awesome! Maybe it's my own ""perversions"" speaking but this book was great! What a wonderful combination of humor, sex and suspense all rolled into one. I was hooked by page 2 and found it hard to put down. Short chapters make this an easy read. Arquettes imagination and humor take the cake. Can't wait for more from this guy!"
1,Appallingly Bad,"I can't believe this even made it into print. The Big Surprising Plot Twist is telegraphed on page twelve, the book is riddled with typos (he misspells his own characters' names, for goodness sake!), the characters are so shallow I didn't really care whether they died, and the only good idea in here is ripped off from Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash. And what's the deal with loudly proclaiming that Lois Duncan edited it? She certainly didn't do a very good job. Arquette should probably stick to writing poorly-worded letters to Penthouse; that's basically what this reads like. Except that even the sex isn't any good."
1,Mutter-out-loud awful,"Wow...this book is terrible. From the painfully hackneyed cliches to the bothersome plot (complete with characters who add nothing to the novel), this book is awful. It does offer some Mystery Science Theater-esque value, but it's still not worth buying. The good news: if you do waste money on this book, it'll be over quickly. Only took me about 3 hours to finish. But, really...go take a knitting class, get your teeth cleaned, spend time with your kids, watch bad reality shows on TV. All would be a better way to spend an afternoon than reading this book."
2,Promising plot but pretty much sucked,"I am really surprised that this Charmed book got such a high rating from most reviewers. It started out good but once portals started opening up out of nowhere and transporting the witches back in time, it just lost its appeal. Not every Charmed book needs time travel and this one did it unsuccessfully with no build up.If you want to read a good Charmed book I suggest ""The Legacy of Merlin"" and ""Pied Piper"" first. Save your money on ""Date with Death"" - get it at the library."
4,So-so,"Sorta waited a while to ship it, but when you did, it got to me fast. Thank you, and I love the cd."
2,Nothing like their other albums.,"What happened to the rock that Anberlin used to provide? I loved their rock songs like Change The World, Cadence, Paperthin Hymn, and Feel Good Drag, but the only rock this one serves up is Godspeed. This pop album may be impressive to someone who's never heard any Anberlin before, but for a longtime fan it's very disappointing."
4,How did they not get sued?,"I guess Broken Social Scene has better things to do than sue Anberlin for copyright infringement re: that cover art, but still..."
1,Disappointing,First listen reaction... All the songs sound the same to me... seems like all the songs were written in an hour or two. Were all the songs in the same key? Message too murky for my Christian taste.
5,AWESOME,"The highlight from Anberlin's Discography up until the 2012 release of ""Vital"" (in my opinion), ""Cities"" is a Must have for Anberlin fans."
5,keeping up the good work,"Third album and not showing any signs of slowing down, Anberlin does it again. When most bands are trying to ""reinvent"" themselves, Anberlin proves that you can incorporate subtle change and still keep a unique and identifiable sound to your work. Go buy this NOW!"
4,Wonderfully soothing aroma and taste!,"The sweet warmth of ginger combined with the earthy flavor of the green tea makes...simply...the perfect cup of tea. The aroma and flavor are wonderfully soothing. I drink this tea hot, but I believe it would also be quite tasty over ice too. Try it with a slice of lemon for extra flavor or to soothe a sore throat.Besides an anytime beverage, I strictly drink ginger tea when my tummy is not feeling at its best, and have found the ginger helpful in clearing my sinuses when colds or allergies strike as an alternate to making chicken soup.It's a hug in a cup!"
2,somebody shut bad boy down,"yeah another atlanta rapper trying to make it big talking about drugs, sex, rims, and thugging but I heard better this is crack music but the wack kind please you want real gangster music get wc's new album get turf talk, messy marv, scc, yukmouth anything but this cheap garbage shame on you puffy or diddy."
4,Read the readme.txt!!!,"You won't be able to do the exercises unless you read, very carefully, the instructions in the book's readme.txt. Thanks to another reviewer, I learned this and was able to get beyond page 65. The instructions in the book for loading the start-up files needed for the labs are wrong, and won't work!"
1,Cheap piece of foam!,This does not compare to any of the other 'headache free' visors out there- it is literally something I could make myself from Michaels. Not to mention I got the wrong color shipped to me!
4,The Failure of Educational Reform,"Seymour Sarason's thoughts on educational reform are shown in both a positive and negative light. He believes that change in educational practices must be radical if they are going to work. He states, ""To us, the biggest risk in education is not taking one."" He maintains that it is certain disaster to continue fine tuning an already broken system. As an educator, I find that Sarason establishes grounds for his concerns even though his critism is gloomy at best. He continues to go back to the bottom line and question whether schools are really doing what is best for children. On a positive note, Sarason raises valid points that challenge educators to look at their own practices and beliefs in a way that will make learning and student achievement foremost in every classroom. It would be difficult to read his book and not feel the need for change. How radical the change needs to be is uncertain, unless one agrees with Sarason."
2,Still not received,"Order placed on september 9 2011, not received at the moment...I'll be back when the T-shirt will arrive.Paolo"
1,The sad thing is...I think they're serious.,"This show is a joke. First off their promo slogan is ""Cops by day, paranormal investigators by night."" Sound familiar to anyone? Does Ghost Hunter's ""Plumbers by day, ghost hunters by night"" ring a bell? That right there hints at how uninspired and unoriginal this show truly is.I love paranormal-based shows (especially the ones serious about educating the world [skeptics and believers alike] with scientific approaches), but PARANORMAL COPS brings nothing new or note-worthy to the field. In fact, I found myself laughing more than anything else while watching this series. And they cram a whole lot in in under just 30 minutes a week. At least PARANORMAL STATE (also on A&E;) is entertaining and genuinely creepy!I say pass on this one and tune into GHOST HUNTERS (Syfy) or GHOST ADVENTURES (Travel channel) instead."
4,Nice Scents,"This has a great scent to it, compared to other candle sets I have ordered that hardly smell at all. Without even burning, it will help out a 10X10 room smell better. Highly recommended."
5,hey he loves it what else can I say!!!,"My boyfriend is a HUGE cowboys fan and football fan in general...I came to his apt to visit recently and what was playing on his TV...THIS lol, cant go wrong with a real fan!!"
4,probably best set of the bunch,"I am a steelers fan, but I think this was the best set of the bunch. I bought several teams greatest games sets."
4,Great Games in Cowboys history,"These videos are great,they are from the live broadcast with the various announcers.Brad and Dale do the Cowboy playoff games. Great DVD quality in terms of viewing. These are the full games which are on each disk. Worth every penny if you are a true Cowboy fan.Go Cowboys"
5,America's team at its best!,"I just recieved my copy in the mail today;and I thoroughly enjoy it.It was nice to watch Danny White bring the boys back again from the brink of a loss against the Falcons like I witnessed when I was a 14 year old and to see the ""Hail Mary"" game that I've read and heard about for so many years.This is an excellent set for all Cowboy fans and I hope they release a second volume with 10 more classic Cowboy games.I highly recommend this set for Cowboy fans and NFL history buffs."
3,NFL films rips you off,"With the billions of dollars that NFL films has made over the years, the poor quality of some of the games is unacceptable. There is no excuse for NFL films to not digitally restore the games for the Cowboys fans. Also the fact that NFL films does not advertise that the games are in such poor condition (and missing parts of the game) on the advertisements and the box is shoddy marketing. Sure they have a disclaimer ON the disc, but you only see that after you purchase the product.Poor job by NFL films."
1,Etch-A-Sketch!,"I bought this Tablet for the family to use, on both a Mac and a PC, and was completely disappointed!I attempted in vain to adjust the sensitivity settings, and couldn't get the tablet to produce a decent radius!Save yourself some money and buy an Etch-A-Sketch instead, because that is exactly the quality that you get with this Tablet!"
4,In the mold of BUSTED !,"This popped up as a Amazon Recommends - and I'm glad I picked it up. More original, fun, POP music. Perfect to pop in the dash and rip around country roads. Even the tracks that copy (or are copied by) other compatriate groups (such as Busted) - so far anyway - each of the groups has their own sound and cover version that changes the song considerably. This is much better than the typical American Idol POP Crap releases."
5,GENIES,"Loooooove this album, McFlys very first album out of 5 i Think, and a love the band, so ofcause I love this CD"
3,all hail mcfly,mcfly are great you can't disagree with me on that and their debut album'room on the third floor' just proves that. mcfly have more of a 60's theme to their music and in the pop industry today people want to be hearing new themes of music and even though mcfly are a new and young band they seemed t be obsessed with this period of time which was well before they were born unless they are hiding sometihng from us. even in interviews the foursome have laid it down hard that the 60's are their dream destination if they were to go back in time. mcfy's album is pretty impresive for the sound of today but they need to make sure that their obsession with a certain time period doesn't get in the way of them writing great music for their up and coming career.good work mcfly.
4,Eureka!,"This CD is ECKSALLENT. I want this played at my funeral, because it will get everyone's toe tapping! Yes, this group has capitalized on the fame of Busted, but I believe this CD is a ""clever critique on consummerism"". Expect to hear ""5 Colours in Her Hair"" on American radio soon, and feel the futility of having to tell everyone that YOU HEARD THEM FIRST. Then again, Robbie Williams is a paradox here in the USA, thankfully. Hooray for McFly!"
5,Very Perceptive,This is a great book with wonderful insights. It is all the more impressive that it is over a hundred years old. They should have had a copy of this at Vatican II. The cover alone is worth the price and would make a great poster.
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"Even the Ginsu is sharp and easy to use out of the box--at a fraction of the price. And it, too, has a lifetime guaratee :)Seriously, if you want to ""cook like Rachael Ray"" and invest in your first good knife set, go to the store and handle several different brands and types before deciding to spend the money on these. There are better quality knives available at this price. Learn about what the knives are made of (Steel vs. Stainless steel ALLOY) and how they're made.I sincerely hope that fans aren't purchasing these over-priced knives because they are endorsed by Rachael Ray, instead of investing in quality German or Japanese-made knives available for close to the same price -- that are used by true Chefs.If Rachael Ray respects her audience, she'd educate her viewers about knives instead of making money off of them, hawking mediocre knives at a premium price."
2,Poor Quality Control Not Up To German Standards,"I have to admit that I was a little shocked with these knives. Opened them on Christmas and used them that night. Had a horrible time trying to get the stickers off of the knives, solvent did not seem to do the trick so I used a rough sponge which took the names off if the knives completely. The next day after cleaning the knives I noticed several rust pits in the knife! This is only 1 day old! The stainless of these knives (made in China) are clearly not up to the standards set by my other German knives."
5,Chopping potatos or tomatos with these knives--Fantastic!,"I've been chopping hundreds of apricots with these knives and they have performed wonderfully. Sharp, well-balanced and the the handles are comfortable and don't slip. I didn't buy these because of Rachel Ray's endorsement; I actually went to Sur La Table and tried out all of their knives. I think it's a personal choice as to how a knife feels in your hand and how your wrist likes its weight. I liked these the best over the more expensive knives for sale, but then that's my personal choice. Other reviewers did not like the orange handles, but for me, that's the best part of the design--the handles seem very ergonomic. The shape of the east-west knives are ideal for slicing and chopping and using a rocking motion for fine dicing. I haven't quite decided what to do with the bamboo case they come in, but for now, the case is a good storage box to protect my knives."
2,Furi Knives,I would not recommend purchasing these knives. Oh the knives work well but if you have an issue don't count on the manufacturer returning emails or calls. I did just that and all have given up. No sense in advertising a warranty if you are not going to cover it. I have a real nice set of the Rachael Ray Gusto-Grip knives. I received the 3 piece knife set one year for Christmas and loved them so much I purchased the set. My 10 inch knife has a handle loose that needs repaired and when I go to sharpen the knives they are not as good as in the beginning. Finally as replacements slowly as they go I am going to replace with more reputable company.
5,The best investment ever!,These knives are perfect all the way around! I love to cook but these knives make things even more fun in the kitchen. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. They are well worth every penny. I also like the fact that these knives come with a bamboo box for storage. It offers even more protection for the blades and makes caring for the knives much easier. Great product!
5,pleasantly surprised,"I just want to start off by saying I am not a big Rachael Ray fan and I never buy products based on Celebrity endorsement. But after helping a friend with the prep-work for a dinner party, I was immediately sold on these knives! The orange handles may be a bit tacky looking, but they make using the knife so easy, steady and just comfortable. The chopping & dicing quality were excellent, better than my Henckels. I quickly upgraded to this set and couldn't be more happy."
2,this knife is dangerous,I have had my knife set for years and took very good care of it. My husband was chopping small carrots with our Rachel Ray 8 inch Gusto Grip knife and the blade came apart from the handle. He was nearly stabbed in the foot. What if his finger was in the way-yikes.I tried contacting Furitechniques only to be redirected to web pages that cannot be found. I did like the way my knife felt and handled but I am shocked by the poor quality. Can anyone suggest a better knife for a reasonable price.We paid almost 200 bucks for the 2 piece set with the bamboo case. We feel we were ripped off!
1,Waste of MONEY!,"This product fit more like an XL than a 3X. It was a total waste of money and to send it back would be a waste of even more MONEY, so I just gave it away!"
3,"club good, company not as good",Club is fine but not happy that although it was represented as new - came without head cover. That's how they save money.
2,Too verbose and no excitement in the writing.,"As a Vietnam Veteran who was there in 1963 the flavor of the writing was drab and did not convey what was really going on from the perspective of the ordinary GI. Yes, there were some historical facts and biographical info that was interesting but something was missing. I read about 25 pages and gave up."
1,Spurious,"You guessed it: It's the same leftist b.s. we were all taught in school. Please, I'm yawning already..."
1,Horrible Experience,"We were given this player as a gift for our five year old. It would freeze during playing of DVD's at first, and we would have to turn the unit completely off and restart it to get the player to work. I thought it was just a little quirk. Then one night about three weeks after we got it, we watched a dvd with it hooked to the the television. Froze a couple of times, no real big deal, then we unplugged it, moved it to another room for watching by itself and it started giving us a NO DISC message. It never worked again. Returned it, and exchanged for another unit, five minutes into the DVD, I pressed the menu button, and that was the last that unit worked. We were getting a LOADING message. Needless to say, try explaining all this to a five year old who just wants to watch his movies!! We returned the second unit, and now are in search of a new unit before going on two long trips in the coming weeks."
1,Used 3 times and it broke.....,"Thank goodness for extended warranties as this machine only had a 90 day warranty. It seemed like a nice deal with all of the travel accessories, but buyer beware...at least purchase a warranty if you decide to try this machine!"
1,Disappointment at its best...........................,I bought this item for my son for x-mas.We are lucky if we got to use it 4 times before it stopped working.Products this bad should not be allowed to be sold.
1,Look for another brand. Didn't even last a year! Bad News!!!!!!,"Do yourself a favor and look for another brand of player.I am also one of the people who bought this dvd player from Sam's Club a little under a year ago. The unit worked fine for about 5 months with a few hours use every couple of days. Then after that I could never get this unit to display ANY menus on the dvd I put in it, and later all I'd get is a ""Loading Disc"" message and nothing else. After that each time I'd put in a dvd I would get a ""No Disc"" message. I returned the unit to Sam's. They refunded my money. I purchased a Mustek 7"" Portable DVD Player in it's place and already it behaves a LOT better!"
1,Don't waste your time,"Bought at Sam's Club...played only once. The second time I tried it the LCD lost verticle sync. Poor Manufacturing, Don't spend money on electronics that only come with a 90 day warranty.....that's telling you something."
