3,Vietnamese Coffee,"So I went to Vietnam last year not knowing very much about Vietnam, and came away really excited about everything Vietnam, especially food and drink wise!basically these coffee filters are great - slow down the pace of life (the slower the coffee drips the better it is), but What I have found in my experience is that the Vietnamese coffee filter sets which you can screw down the inside filter thing are much better as they give a much more controlled drip and a stronger more authentic coffee =)See the one I mean in this one-minute recipe video on youtube -[....]"
4,"So Simple, So Affordable, So Delicious","Makes great cappuccinos! If you like vending machine coffee in Japan, this makes a great taste alike. Who knew that gravity and a fine grind plus water would make such a great cup of coffee..."
3,"Okay, But Tiny and Bottom Plate is Attached",Works well but is very small. The bottom plate does not separate from the cup. Works ok but small quantity.
1,"Fire Suppression and Detection Systems, 3rd Edition","Worst book purchase yet from Amazon. The book is NOT hardbound as stated. My book arrived with the box and wrapping intact, however, the back cover was ripped about 2"" at the binding. My Captains test is too close to return it and find another one from a different site. All of my previous purchases for promotional tests were 100% as stated on their web page. They will hear from me about this one. NOT worth the money at all."
1,counterfeit book,"""The book was without a doubt counterfeit, and not hardbound as promised. The only reason I didn't demand my money back is because I needed it for an upcoming test; it would have taken too long to return. I will NEVER do business with them again!"""
2,Saw blade,Ragged cuts with first use. Intended to use this as a one-shot blade for laminate flooring but it dulled so fast I had to go to one of my good blades to finish the job. Might be okay for framing.
3,"Sounded like a good idea, but the real deal is hard to beat","My wife and I purchased this V Tech laptop for my 8 year old daughter. We thought it would be both fun and educational and worth the money. To our surprise, she quickly lost interest in the laptop and instead chooses to use the real computer we have set up at home. The graphics and displays are rather simple and basic and it just doesn't compare with a real computer. My daughter prefers to play educational games on the real computer or with educational DVD's we have purchased for her. I think the main complaint is that the graphics are very pixalated and in black and white.I think the guys at V Tech had a good idea and a good concept, but it's also hard to deliver a great product for what it costs. V Tech has a great reputation for developing educational ""toys"" for kids, but in this day and age where our kids are basically born with a mouse or a Gameboy in their hands, this product just falls short in retaining their interest."
2,not fun enough for a 7&9 yrs old.,"I bought this base on what the maker pump it up to be, my son had it for a year and did not show interest then I pass it on to my younger son 6 going 7 he is the type of kid you think would have liked it, nothing so now I'm stuck with this thing that my 2 boys are never going to touch. Would not recommend it. Picture is poor its like a play thing rather a learning tool due to poor quality. I am dissapointed. Do not buy this."
3,some decent info,"I initially found this book in a bookstore and did some cursory reading of it before I bought it online. I have to say it seemed more interesting in the store. The book is a collection of articles published by Harvard Business School. Some articles are more 'readable' than others. - But if you're desperate to find a book that at least addresses some of the many issues women face in the business world, then I'd say this is a decent book to buy. But it is not a ""how to"" book for coping with problems in the male dominated corporate world. - Still some of the articles make interesting points."
5,Abundant in Theory and Insight,"While I would say that this book is not a ""How to"" guide, I feel it does an excellent job in explaining the relevant trends as they relate to Women in the workplace. This book provides the FRAMEWORK for solutions with some real world examples of how companies have worked within the mentioned frameworks. If you are looking for outright solutions (or at least a myraid of case studies), I would not recommend this book on its own.I would even go as far as to analyze the work environment before attempting to implement any of the frameworks mentioned in this text - The ""How to Begin Small Wins"" section in ""A Modest Manifesto for Shattering the Glass Ceiling"" has some of the questions that can be used to complete this analysis."
4,Here's a Tip,"Buy used games and books from merchants, but not gaming systems! Buy them from an actual store or directly from Amazon or other reputable online site (not from a third party). This area is for product reviews (to help people in decision making). Take complaints directly to amazon and the 3rd party merchant you chose. The only time I had a problem with a merchant (wrong product description), Amazon took care of it (plus I got a refund). Your problem can't be handled in the review area. The end :o)"
2,PSP review,The PSP seems to be in fine condition so far EXCEPT the analogue which is messed up. When I go up in a game the characters keep going up like the analogue stays up. Same with when i turn it left or down. When i move right its good though. It's really annoying but other then that it's in good condition. I would've really liked it if the seller had given me a heads up on the PSP analogue! I'm disappointed!
1,Absolutely horrible,"Don't buy this product or any electronic devices online. There is the danger that you will get a defective one and it will be a great inconvenience to return. And that's what happend to me. You might think online shopping is cheap and convenient. But remember, no business people would make it convenient for you when you are returning a product."
1,Great Hardware Weak Software,"This is a very disappointing system. Looking at the specs, it is a great piece of hardware. As of yet, there has not been any good games for this handheld. Only watered down PS2 games are avalible.The DS lite is a better value. Many fun titles,and a better price. It also has a slightly brighter screen.Don't get suckered into buying this machine. Not worth the money. It will be nothing more than an expensive paper weight."
1,not worth the effort.,"The point being about the psp has always been about hype. There is no fun games, there is no new age technology, its all words and lies that sony uses to market a product to be competitive.I have to admit i was excited when i first owned the psp; a week later i was bored to death i didnt know how anyone could enjoy such a console.For your sake the console would only be enjoyable at 300$ put into it, but thats not enough because the console itself is losing its reputation and is unenjoyable.I am glad to own a 360 over a psp which is equal if not the same price you pay for the psp console."
1,It was a great system while it lasted-- BEWARE!!!!,"We bought this system 45 days ago- what a great game system- while it lasted!!! BEWARE- this system is already having problems- games freezing while playing, power shutting off in middle of game, power on- screen stays black, sometimes won't even turn on. Called Sony- all they will do is send a REFURBISHED system in its place- this is only 45 days old!!! They said this is their stated warranty- they do not repair them. It seems to be a very fragile system. I have ready many online reviews of people having the same problems. Very Very disappointed with this product and Sony for offering such a poor warranty and for not standing by their products! Shame on you Sony!"
4,lots of potential....but pricey,"I have had my psp a couple of months, but only own one game (grand theft liberty city stories) b/c the thing is so expensive. Pretty sweet little system though. Easy to operate, nice menus that are user friendly. I would suggest, as others have, to pick up one of the beefier memory cards as all the media will eat up serious space. Also, buy a case to make sure it doesn't get scratched up. When you add it all up, the sony psp is very costly. I would recommend it anyway, simply b/c sony has (or will have) top notch games available.By the way, getting on the internet is pretty easy, but several pages wouldn't load."
4,mickslick review,Not to bad for the price I payed got 2 free games out of it and 2 used one for a good price not to bad just wish battery would last longer only last 3 hrs. so anymore i play games on it i geuss ill keep it plug in. that the only down fall.
4,Watch more movies on it than play games.,"I bought this thing when the price hit $169 and glad I did. I got three games (Lemmings, Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter) which are all fun, but what I love the most about this is the ability to download movies to it. The UMD movies IMO are a waste of money, so I bought a 4 gb memory card from Hong Kong for $17 bucks and just rip my DVD movies onto the memory. Fits 3 movies in the highest quality and that's pretty much what I do is watch movies. Just watched the Rambo trilogy and think the screen is great. The speakers blow hardcore but head phone quality is good.Anyway, much like people have said the game selection isn't that great but the entertainment value of movie watching is worth the price."
4,The future of digital gaming is here!! but Value Pack better,"I got my PSP a one and a half years ago and I dont regret it.Believe me it is mind-blowing.I never expected a handheld could have all of this.PROS:1.)The psp has amazing graphics for a handheld2.)It is a multimedia gadget it not only has games but also music,videos,photos and network.CONS:1.)It is pretty expensive2.)Value packs better as it has other accesories which are useful.Overall I would say that if you can afford it then go for it."
3,"Great gaming, bad reliability","PSP rocks. I'm not gonna argue. It is much better then the DS. However, my PSP for some reason stopped reading games after a few months, and I don't know how to fix it. I would reccomend getting a version of the PSP with a warranty, which the PSP core doesn't have."
1,PSP SUCKS!,"PSP Sucks! It is too fragile and the warranty is awful. I had two of them, they are fun while they last. The sceen cracked. It ruins the whole system and they do not cover this in the warranty. They (Sony) say that it is due to impact. Well, the first one cracked while resting in a car, the second one while playing. Both of them were ruined within less than 6 months. They offered to send me a refurbish one for $89 plus S&H. What a deal!"
4,My second PSP,"After looking into the iPod and the zune, I decided on the PSP for a number of reasons. Considering that all three devices are in the same price range the PSP provides more of what I'm looking for. I bought a 4GB mem. stick and can load it up with movies or music videos and still have space for several MP3 albums. I haven't looked into the game titles yet, but it's nice to have that option.In short, I got the PSP for the movies, music and games. Now, if Sony would do something with the files system to make more user friendly I would consider rating the PSP 5/5."
5,My favorite portable electronic device,"This is hands down my favorite gadget. In fact, I purchased a second ""Slim"" model to support the franchise.Few devices allow you to...1. Play 3D games that are PS2 quality (DS is N64 quality)2. Play mp3s3. Play videos stored on memory card4. View photos5. Watch full movies (UMD will die but as a format it's not that bad)6. Browse the internet (limited)7. Listen to streaming radio8. Play multi-player games over the internet with other PSP users9. View RSS feeds10. Link with PS3Right now PSPs are a bargain. With the amount of great games available, I can't recommend getting one enough if you enjoy media on the go."
4,What you need to know,So your looking into buying a psp. First thing you should know is the psp your looking at is the original psp out to market. Its well built and plays all games.I have owned the 1000 and the 3000 and have to say the 1000 feels like the better build of the two. Now saying that the 3000 has a built in microphone and the screen resolution is better. Its also brighter. Load times on the 3000 are also faster then the 1000.The screen on the 3000 is much better for daytime use. It does not glare as much as the 1000. If you care about gaming with this on your tv and you have a non high definition t.v. or a regular t.v. the psp 3000 is really the choice for you. The psp 1000 has no support for on t.v. gameplay.All in all its your choice as a gamer what you would like out of your psp. Good hunting!
4,Teresa,"I purchased this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. However, it would have been nice if the system would have come with some kind of protective pouch/case. Even a cheap one would have worked. Otherwise, everything is great, especially the price I paid. No one else could have matched the price."
4,Great Christmas Present,"I don't know anything about these games, but I got the PSP for my boyfriend for Christmas, and he loves it. It has worked well, and more games in this format are coming out all the time. He keeps it with him almost all the time - definitely an awesome gift idea."
2,It was less than satisfactory,"I was stunned at its condition. The battery was dead,the screen and case scratched and both the umd and memory stick reader didn't work. I guess you get what you paid for."
4,great system,"the psp1000 (first gen psp) is a great handheld system...the graphics are stunning..the screen is beautiful..its crisp and clear..think of a mini plasma tv and youll get the idea...there are LOTS of games out there.. so theres something for everybody...this is just the thing to keep yourself busy during those long car drives.Now that we also have the ps vita which is nice ill admit. for the layman, its basically the next get psp... after checking that system out..i have to say that the psp is MORE DURABLE and well built than the vita... its a better deal! the vita feels a bit cheapy in my opinion... im sure ill have one in time but ill wait until the price drops that is..."
3,"Very good but not ""like new""","The PSP came in a nice case and all described parts were present. The listing said it was ""like new"" but the battery compartment cover was missing. This was not mentioned and should have been."
2,Lighting...........,Don't get me wrong this an awesome piece of electronics. the only place u can see it is if u r in a cave. any amount of lighting can make every disappear and a reflection of your face appears on the screen. and if u buy this item u have 2 buy a screen protector so it doesn't get scratched.
3,gammer,This item was bought as a christmas gift wont know anything about it until after the holidays. I will probobly change my review after i use it.
2,Not as fun as a Nintendo DS Lite,"It was a frustrating experience trying to get videos to play on the PSP. The files have to be named a certain way and created very specifically to the PSP. Also the mp3 player interface isn't very good at all.In terms of gaming, the screen and graphics are quite nice but the games on the Nintendo DS/DS Lite are a lot more fun to me.In the end, I was disspointed in the PSP and sold it. I am quite happy with the DS Lite, it simply does what it's supposed to and doesn't worry about trying to do everything. The PSP tries to do more but it's practically worthless at doing them. The fact that you have to spend additional money to buy a Sony Memory Stick to be able to save games with the PSP sucks also."
4,Purchase through Amazon - Just the right thing,"I bought this item for my grandson. He wanted a brand new one, but I convinced him to give Amazon a try and look for a used one. It was a good investment and experience for him. He hardly ever puts it down. Delivery time was even sooner than expected. Thanks Amazon"
5,As great as everyone else says it is!,"My 10 year old won't put it down, but when he sleeps, I've checked it out- it's awesome!Beware- with the new law, it's illegal to transfer your copyrighted DVDs to the PSP, so if you're getting it as a DVD player, you're in for a lot of work on your computer, a lot of frustration, and perhaps a little guilt.Movies and music play well on it, and games look great. All the controls are in the right place, and there are a lot of accessories out there.So, it's exactly what they say it is, sans a viable DVD player (unless you want to fork out extra money for UMD movies that only play on your PSP)."
2,Love the design,"Just bought this fan a few weeks ago. I simply love the design. It's also such a nice space saver. The breeze feels so natural compared to a regular fan. This model is nice and quiet. I can barely tell that it's on. The only draw back that I have with this model is that it isn't height adjustable. While the air it blows out is nice, when sitting it barely catches your face. A major draw back especially if you are a tall person. I have to prop it up on top of something on those really hot days just so it will cool my face. All that being said I really like this tower fan. I don't know if it's right for everybody."
2,adjustable but noisy,"I bought this rack because of the advertised weight, rated capacity, and a $17 experiment isn't going to kill me. The adjustability is nice and the single rear support helps with aerodynamics. However, the rear pivot makes such a racket that it drives me nuts. I like my bikes to be silent except for shifting and braking.450 grams is an exaggeration. Once you add the beefier seat stay brackets it's more like 580 grams. The 30 lb. capacity is likewise an exaggeration. I tried to carry a twelve pack of beer in addition to my tool kit the other day and the 13-14 lb. load was enough to bend the seat stay brackets. It's fortunate that I rarely carry more than 5 lbs."
2,Discontinued Product,National Geographic has discontinued this TOPO! series in favor of their newer approaches to displaying topographical maps. They do not support the product on OS X Mountain Lion. NG and Amazon are still offering TOPO! for sale for a few states and unless you need and ask for support from NG the marketing does not mention it is discontinued and unsupported for the latest OS X.Since my FedEx delivery occurred to the wrong address and was not found for about a month it is too late to return the software but that is what it deserves.The concept of displaying topographical maps without borders is a good one and if the software worked reliably and was marketed honestly it would be worth about half of the asking price.
4,I wish I could have given this CD 4 1/2 stars,"This is a great collection of music, and a wonderful reflection of the hard work and careful choices involved in the inclusion of material in the Ken Burns ""Jazz"" collection. I originally bought this CD thinking it worth the money for just ""Salt Peanuts,"" ""A Night in Tunisia,"" and ""Manteca."" Instead, I have come to appreciate much more of Dizzy Gillespie's music, and jazz music in general. A great CD for anyone interested in Jazz."
2,Disappointing,"Normally, I love Omar Tyree's work, but I could not get into this book. There were no relatable characters, and the plot is extremely slow moving. Terrance spends a lot of time explaining and excusing himself and then describing his sex life. You'd think that Terrance's travels and sexcapades would make the book interesting, but it tends to slow the book down. Once you get to the 5,000th description of his arousal, it gets old."
1,Never Again,I will never buy another Omar Tyree book again.....The chapters were consisted of Terrance meeting a woman and screwing a new woman while getting phone calls from numerous other women. There were almost too many women to keep up with. For me the last 20-30 pages were good and then that is stretching it because Omar just wrapped that part of the book up. He should have devoted more of the 400 page book to what happened in the last 30 pages (don't want to give the ending away for anybody who will actually read this book after reading these reviews) Don't buy this book. The only reason I finished the book was because I paid for it and I wanted to move on to the next book I had to read.
2,Dont waste your time,this book is all about sex and is totally predictable. thank GOD i checked it out from the library and didnt spend my money on it.
1,The worst read,"I purchased this book based on a lot of ravings- I was sadly mistaken. I was very disgusted and bored with his thoughts and writing. I mean where was he going with this other than a young male model screwing a lot of women. It was not worth finishing his book. I will never suggest or purchase another of his books again. To tell you the truth, this book was a waste of money and I don't want to keep this on my shelf. Beware"
2,What Do They Want,"This is my second time reading this novel in five years and I still do not have a clue as to What They Want as far as this book is concerned. This book lack substance and a story line.Mind you it could of been good as each and everyone woman in Terrance life brought something new and different to the table which made me believe that Tyree may after all have a point. Sadly however this book was a flop. The only saving grace were the sex scenes except one in particular . So in the end, what does it really boil down to? I still do not know."
1,What They Want is a disappointment,"Mr. Tyree is losing me. What They Want and Pecking Order were both huge disappointments. My number one problem with this book is the fact that it is 400+ pages. You need to have more than sex to keep that going. My other problem is that parts of the book are drawn out to tell about situations that were not interesting to begin with. The drama with the sister, the celibate friend, all boring. The book was boring and I skipped to the last 3 chapters so I would know what happened. I never even got a good idea of what Terrence looked like, with the 500 million descriptions in the book, I don't think the author ever described what the brother looked like (or I skipped past it)."
4,A good review,"It is definitely worth the buy!My husband actually read the book before me and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was the first time I saw him read an Omar Tyree book like that since Do Right Man. I am enjoying the book and nearly finished. It is good to know about how men deal with women, especially more than 1. I definitel agree that what you do can come back to haunt you in some way. So for my brothers out there... tighten up or get hemmed up!"
5,Great! Great!,"At first I thought that this character was just going to be a straight hoe throughout the book and he wouldnt see the error of his ways. But he really stops and thinks about what he is doing and how it actually affects the women in his life, he really sees the trees and not just the forest. Omar Tyree is exceptional at story telling and his books are always page turners. I cant put it down and I cant wait for the next one that he brings to the table. Bravo!"
1,Glad I didn't buy it...,"I got lucky and found this book in my library. After reading a couple of chapters, I took it back and told them to get their money back, burn the book, and slap the person for ordering it. I simply could not get into this book."
1,Why did I buy this book?,"I put this book down on page 50 and came to Amazon.com to read the reviews. Doesn't matter though I can't read this anymore. I'm so disappointed, all I can say is you can't judge a book by its cover!"
5,See How They Grow - Wild Animals,"We've had this video for nearly five years and every child who's seen it has been completely enthralled. Children 18 months to 4 years relate particularly well to the selection of animals (rabbits, foxes, snakes & pheasants) as well as the method of introducing the animals throughout their growth cycle. Overall video quality is high (color, sound, etc.) and it's ability to withstand repeating viewing is strong. It also makes a great gift!"
2,Not so much,Panties feel flimsy and fall off. They are not my favorite Vanity Fair. I was disappointed as I usually love their products.
2,Something about the leg holes...,"I have another cut by this same maker in the same size that fit great. The seams on these ones are more ""raw"" and the leg-holes are strangely tight!"
5,Perfect fit,"I usually don't buy undies that are not full up to the waist briefs, but these panties have converted me. They fit beautifully and don't show above my jean waist line!"
4,"Comfortable, covers rear well",Very comfortable. I like the design that allows your derriere to be completely covered while your legs in front are unhindered. I would have liked the crotch to be lined with white cotton.
5,quality hi cut underwar for every true lady,These quality underpants are worth every penny. They look terrific and feel better than terrific.They do not curl or bunch at the seams and there is no puckering. They stay nice and flat even under pantyhose.I rate them the highest possible rating.
4,Good product,"The size is larger than expected, but despite my mistake this is a quality product, nice material."
1,vanity fair panties,I bought this model before and really like them. The fabric wasd ifferent and quite stiff like latex and was cut skimpy I was not happy with them especially for $[...] a piece. I would not buy them again or would buy them a couple of sizes bigger.
1,wrong size no response,"I ordered these underpants a few weeks ago. As far as the brand goes they are terrific. I bought this particular kind about 10 years ago and they have last that long. However, my low review is because of the company I bought them from. I ordered all the same size about l0 pair. 2 of the l0 came about 6 sizes too large as they were mislabeled. The person who packed each one didn't care enough to even bother to get all the same size. I have e-mailed amazon and tried to contact the seller with no response. I would not use this company again."
5,very comfy,"these are very comfy, wash up well and don't show under my slacks. I would buy them again. Wish they came tagless and seamless."
1,These are NOT SIZED correctly.,Size 8 were way too tight which I thought was weird so I bought 4 more size 9 and they were just as tight. The other reviewers mentioning the wrong sizing are CORRECT. DO NOT BUY. I'll be contacting Vanity Fair....what a waste of money!!!!
1,Favorites fall out of ranking,"These have always been my favorites and I have ordered them over and over. This last time, I ordered the same size as always and although I have lost 20 lbs. due to health issues, all three pair of panties I ordered, in different colors, are way too tight for comfort. What happened Vanity Fair?"
3,"Mediocre, Web version for free","Like so much in the opensource world, this book is not designed for the ease of it's users. The authors show little concern for accessebility or introducing their material in a structured, sensible manner befitting a primer on Gimp. This book, at best, has value as a reference work..."
1,Incredibly bad writing.,I will just add to the two negative reviews below by saying that the *explanations* I read when skimming through the book were so bad that I could only understand the sections on points I was already familiar with. I think this is the worst technical writing that I have ever seen in print.
1,Demanding Refund,"I am unable to derive any benefit from the book, it is too bookish and not ""step-by-step"" explanation.I therefore, demand refund."
1,Obsolete,"This book refers to Version 0.9 of GIMP. As of this review, Version 2.6 is current.Nuff said?Seriously, it spends a lot of copy on installing on Linux and setting up SCSI scanners, Ridiculous today!Whether the material about using GIMP is still relevant is irrelevant. The book is completely out of date!"
4,A good read for those with short attention spans,"I enjoyed reading this book a lot, but when I finished it, I realized there were some things I would have liked it to discuss. This book focuses mostly on the disasters of the modern centuries. That's fine, for some people, I guess, but I tend to be more interested in stuff that took place before the middle ages. This book also made a good attempt to be eurocentric, and it did cover some interesting events from other parts of the world, but I got bored hearing about every time Mount Vesuvius erupted."
5,DON'T LET THE RELIGIOUS FANATICS AT THE DOOR SEE THIS!,"REALLY, if they come knocking and telling you how the world is going to end this second (or maybe next week) and their proof is how bad times are and how many things are going wrong... well you can whip this little book out and show them just how horrible life has been all along! A little perspective! But wait... you started a dialogue with them .. and they'll be back.. again, and again, and again... oh no!"
1,no holding power,"They rusted within a week, so the 'spring' does not work right, thus they dont line up as they should. So that in adittion to the lack of magnetic stregnth means they dont hold the door open in anything more than a light breeze.A HUGE dissapointment after reading the other good reviews.I even tried two on one door, still no good.A VERY disapointing purchase, my worst buy yet."
5,"A great, simple idea!","No longer do we need to prop sneakers or whatever's handy in front of our doors to ensure they won't slam shut when we're trying to take advantage of some of the cooler spring/fall/evening air.With a pair of cats that like to imagine they're on the hunt while sitting at our screen door, it's always been a concern that a gust of wind will dislodge the makeshift door blocker and allow the door to swing shut and hurt our little guys. These magnetic door stops effectively deal with that issue. Not a door has slammed in our house since we have installed them (I picked up about a half dozen of them). Money well spent!"
4,Works as described,"This is a good, simple idea. It is a decent product which works as advertised. I would generally have to agree with most of the other reviews -- just the right amount of catch. The only knock I have is that the shipping costs were a little bit much -- i.e. cost as much as the product, thus doubling the overall cost. It's the only solution I could find and the door in question was REALLY annoying me so I was willing to take the hit."
4,Just what I needed!,These door stops worked well for us on our two bedroom doors that were continually blowing closed from the wind. They were easy to install and they seem to work well. I would recommend them.
5,Honey is Worth The Money,"Forgive me for the rhyme, but the sentiment is true. This product is rich, but at the same time light. After opening the jar, I loved the way the Hair Honey smelled, it has a sweet aroma but I didn't detect the ""cirtus"" smell in the product description. I am only sorry I didn't get the larger size."
1,Useless,"I have natural hair and I find that this product does absolutely nothing. It is a VERY light oil and seems to be most appropriate for very fine textured, relaxed hair."
4,Smells good and does the job,"As suggested in some of the reviews I have read, I have only used this around my edges and to brush my naturally curly hair back into a ponytail or bun. It has worked well for this use. With my texture, it may be heavy for flat ironing as I have very bouncy hair, but I don't know that to be true yet. It is not my favorite CD hair product (hair balm is, but I have not tried any of them outside of wearing my natural curls - trying to stay away from heat for a while!). Hair honey definitely smells better than any of the other CD hair products I have tried - hair milk, healthy hair butter, lisa's elixir, loc butter (on a friends hair), and hair balm.UPDATE - I tried a very little bit on the ends of my hair when I flatironed it this weekend. I dabbed my finger just so that there was only a trace and rolled the ends of each piece of my hair before flatironing. I was pleased with the results. My ends did not look dry, frizzy, or damaged."
3,Nothing special but it works,"This product can weight down your hair very quickly, you only need the tinest amount. I find that it works better on natural hair and relaxed hair that is damaged. When my relaxed hair was damaged, this worked great and was very moisturizing but once my hair got better this even in the smallest amount made my hair very greasy and heavy feeling. I had to wash it only a couple days. For my little bro, his natural hair loves this product, it makes the curls softer and gives his hair a natural shine."
3,"Great, but again?","Ok. this story is well written and exciting but the plot is a hundred novels old! Let's start: first, they plan on attacking a clan world that should be garrisoned only by a PGC, but find out ,too late of course, that they have a front line unit on the planet, which also happened to Prince Davion in Lethal heritage and to the Black Thorns in DRT. Then they lose their ability to take off from the planet,what has happened to almost all units, mercenary and regular alike, everytime an assault is planed on the Battletech universe, then, like all the other books, one of the characters comes up with an uncanny way of saving the day. I'm not saying that the book is bad, just that the story is not as inventive as it may appear."
4,An exellent novel that meets the Jaguar Fist first!!!!,This novel has good info of the workings ofone of the finest merc units around!!!The Northwind Hilanders meet the SmokeJaguars on there own ground.However things do not go as plannedand everyone must wonder if any willsurvive
4,This IS the original poster text,"I have an original poster for this awesome movie and despite what the other comment says, this is the correct text from the original 1972 release.They are holding 44 Magnums in the poster BTW"
5,Regeneration,"This is by far the best of the best of the fifteen books I have of this type. Very well written. You don't want to miss this book. This is the type of books that keep you young. From the very first, I couldn't put is down. A great book to carry on your travels. I would not ever leave home without a copy. Maybe the author will write more. J.W.Miller"
4,"Fast Shipment, Great Price!!","Ultra fast shipping! Overall a good transaction, the only reason it got 4 instead of 5 stars is because the case had a few cracks in it when it arrived. Thanks very much, I would order from you again."
4,A quick read mystery novel,"""Unfinished Business"" is a quick read mystery novel that keeps you guessing up until the very end. The story starts from the first sentence without having to read several chapters in to get to the juicy portion. The author injects mystery, suspense, a little romance, and humor all rolled into one book. It's easy to read this book in one setting, and the reader can easily follow along with all the characters. Can't wait for the next book to be released!"
4,Great Whodunit,"I don't usually finish ""whodunits"", but ""Unfinished Business"" was a page turner for me. I really liked it and the end was not what/who I suspected. Knighthorse in the end proved to be a pretty awesome guy, when throughout the book I had this love/hate feeling for him because he's such a cocky SOB. I have to admit though that he made me laugh out loud by some of the stuff he said.It's a great ""whodunit"" and I'm looking forward to Hargrove's next one book being released in March 2007"
1,wrong book.,"I ordered this book about a week ago, it shipped VERY quickly. I opened the package and on the book was electrical tape covering a few things up. That's kind of sketchy if you ask me. I expected to receive the product I ordered, but underneath the tape in big letters it read ""INSTRUCTOR'S EDITION"" as well as ""THIS PRODUCT IS NOT INTENDED FOR RE-SALE."" I kind of feel like I've been ripped off, I got this to home school my brother so it's still usable but if I were taking the course in college it was a waste of money. the book is in great condition though."
3,As described.,It was as described and was shipped immediately. It mounted on the rifle with no problems. I am satisfied with it.
3,Mediocre,"Target hits from a 22 are clearly visible at 25 yards; still visible at 50 yards, but not clear. Panning the scope around on the target, one sees variation in the focus clarity which suggests surface irregularity of the lenses. The optics are adequate for casual plinking and small game hunting at modest range making it a reasonable choice for the casual 22LR shooter needing a budget scope. However, as scopes go these days, it is on the lower end of optical quality.It can be focused for best retical clarity or best target clarity (""best"" never actually being crisp), but not both. One must find a compromise to fit one's preferences. Considering the rather low price for a variable power scope, I consider it a mediocre value and give it 3 stars. A lot depends on your tastes and optical demands.The included scope mount rings are of low quality. I did not use them."
2,Disapointed,"I got this scope expecting it to be at least as good as the free scopes that came on my kids Air Rifles i was dissapointed.it's very dark, and out of focus and I can't get it to focus at all. it was suppsoed to go on my 10/22, but i think I'm gonna return it or chuck it...it was cheap, but worse than a free one...."
2,buy a barska instead,it's a cheap scope you get what you pay for i sent it back cause it was blurry and i didn't like the blue tint that u see when looking through it get a barska u will like it better
5,NCStar 3-9X40 Silver Scope/Ruby Lens,"Great scope for the money, good clarity and field of vision. Mounted on different rings to fit my rifle and sighted in quickly with included instructions."
5,Super soft!,"This blanket is too cool. It's larger than I would have thought, and soooooooo soft and silky. It's washable, which is great! I see there is a choking hazard warning on Amazon. I don't see where they get that from. It seems completely safe."
3,"Good Writing, Confusing Story","I made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book, and because of that I found the book to be completely different from the movie and therefore hard to follow. There are a few characters that were interjected into the story that confused me and there were times when I found myself just skimming over parts that were uninteresting. The writing itself is good and suspenseful, but the story, for me, was just overall hard to follow. I would recommend reading the book beforehand, especially if you have interest in seeing the movie because both are told quite differently from one another."
5,Breathtaking,This is an amazing story about an abused wife's fight for survival. Nancy Price creates an interesting veiw on spousal abuse and also manages to bring in dozens of interesting characters and a few subplots without taking away from the overall story.
1,Please don't waste your time!,"I worked in a bookstore about 10 years ago and had the opportunity to read `Sleeping With the Enemy'.I found it to be one of the most poorly written books I had ever read, as the writing ability of the author resembled something out of an 8th grade composition class. It seemed a poor first attempt by a fledgling author and I remember being very surprised that it actually got published. `Sleeping With the Enemy' was a disappointingly easy read, written in an immature style, by an obviously inexperienced writer.Years later I was shocked to find that someone had based a film on what I considered one of the worst books I ever wasted two evenings on.I think the pseudo feminist message (an abused woman fights back against her oppressor) and the movie's `Julia Roberts Dazzle Factor' might confuse some with whether or not this is a well-written and interesting book.Sadly, it is not."
3,"for once, not as good as the film","In general the book was not as good as the movie because there were no real nail-biting moments. (Stephen King's Rose Madder had a far better description of a fleeing wife's terror and hope). I liked how Sara plotted her limited spending and fixed up her new home by herself, and I enjoyed some vivid descriptions of foods she ached to eat and material comforts that she missed. But I could not get interested in the lives of the bitter mute invalid and her home companion who was hiding a pregnancy from a disapproving family. Those women were so passive and boring, and they turned a potential thriller novel into stereotypical ""chick lit"". At least the book's version of Martin wasn't as over-the-top as the movie's, and readers got plenty of passages from his perspective."
5,Absolutely Fabulous,"I saw the movie and I thought it was good. So I decided to find the book. I looked all over the place for it and found it in a used book store. I read and re-read it. I love it!! It is my favorite book. The detail was exquisite. Try to find it, it is a must read. Very realistic. Strong plot. Great ending! (Different from the movie)"
2,Movie is better,"This is one case where I thought the movie was better than the book. I do have to agree with other reviewers that the movie was changed somewhat from the book, but all the changes were good. I couldn't get the same suspenseful feeling from the main character in the book as the movie. Sara was totally lackluster in feeling anything once she escaped, I felt. Honestly, the book gave me a headache. I also couldn't understand why Sara was even interested in the professor - there just wasn't enough elaboration on that point. From an avid reader, it kills me to say the movie was better."
3,Book was okay,The book I orderd that I thought was going to be better than his 2nd edition fell short. But it was a good book.
2,This guide is too simple,"If you have used point-and-shoot camera for a while and want to learn more tricks like me, I would not recommend this book because two third of the guide gives the basics you should already know, and the last third has few tips you might think useful. In addition, this book is B&W print that makes the example photos not standing out between different settings."
5,extraordinary collection,"From its wonderful title to its powerful final story, this collection defies the very limitations the writer has imposed on herself. Ostensibly there is a gimmick at work here: each story includes (and is usually titled with) an animal that begins with a different letter of the alphabet. In the hands of another writer this device might force a writer to include weaker stories in the name of the ""fulfilling the assignment,"" but Ms. Adam's has such a gift for language and scene, for finding the precise moments when two people connect or don't connect, that one actually forgets the original conceit. It's only when you come back to it after reading most or all of the book--when you think about all the ways the animals and humans have been circling around each other--that you really appreciate what a triumph this collection represents. I eagerly await this writer's next work."
1,Don't buy this DVD recorder,I have owned it for about 2 years. I worked reasonably well for about a year (although I had to have them send the 8X software upgrade). Now it is worthless. Wont even play a standard DVD. Of course the warranty is expired. I would pass on this unit.
3,Does the job but smells awful.,This product was recommended to me to handle a rash on my leg (not a baby's butt). It did the job but I have two complaints: it's messy and needs to be covered; it smells very strongly of perfume. I don't know if they can do anything about the messiness. A thickener might work. But the perfume stench is simply unacceptable. Until they produce a fragrance-free version I won't be using this again.
5,Yeah! Cool Animorph Book!,"This is one of the latest Animorph Books. #26 is The Attack, #27 The Exposed, #28 The Experiment, #29 The Sickness, <Megamorphs #3> Elfangor's Secret, and #30 The Renunion. A total of 54 books are scheduled."
4,"I think the book was good not the best, but still good.","I thought the book was dull until they had to be squid and found the ship, because it got exciting when they turned into squid and found the ship. It was dull because it was not really exciting to me in the beginning. The reason is because Rachel fell off the beam and T.T. caught her and asked her out."
2,"Animorphs go down the drain, down the drain down the drain..","...my fair author. The plot is good. The story isn't. It took about 150 pages to tell almost nothing. When I was done reading this, I was wondering where all the story was. I could hardly remember what had happened. Yes, the more the Animorphs, the worse the quality. It's hard to find a good Animorph book. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,"Not Bad, But...","This book is about the androids' holograms faltering and the animorphs struggle to help them.Why do i say not bad, well because it's not extremely good either. It's a bit far fetched, if you ask me. And each book gets lousier and lousier. Take a look at all the books for kids. Goosebumps, Spooksville, and what not are deteriorating in quality. And i think it's happening in ""Animorphs"" as well.Pardon me if i contradict you guys, but i really don't think it's that good a book."
2,"Ok, but not the best","Alright. It might have been ok, but it was boring. Also, Rachel was a rude creep throughout. She seriously needs to learn some manners. Can't she tell a guy she ain't interested without insulting him?"
2,Not a good animorphs book.,I didn't like this one at all. Rachel is acting really weird in this book. Being part of the Animorphs is like a drug for her. If the Yeerks leave Earth Rachel will want to keep fighting. Who knows what might happen? The only good part in the Permilite ship. The Permilites are soo polite and it's really funny.
4,great tasting,"Not the most economical way to buy this, but the packets are convenient and the cheesy garlic is delicious without being overpowering."
2,Very Nasty,"These were not what I expected. I expected them to be a bit crispier yet they were mushy and the cheese tasted fake. I threw them away because they so so flavorless and soft even when I had them in the oven for over 30 minutes. I dont recommend these cheap bisquits, you are better off making your own."
1,Extremely poor noise canceling and uncomfortable,"I had tried a pair of the Sennheiser 250's. With those, you could hear a range of sound disapear and reapear as you turned them off and on. With these, you could hear a range of sound become slightly mufled.The noise canceling is extremely poor.Also, they are not very comfortable. The band digs into the top sides of my head.But the real killer is, they actually made you feel as if you have motion sickness. No kidding. Again, I've tried other pairs of active noise cancelling headphones, and this did not occur"
3,"Non, Non! Not a Starter!","The Jarvi 5th has been overrated by Gramophone as a starter introduction. I agree with other reviewers here that the tempos are erratic perhaps, as also pointed out, that the symphony has very obviously not been rehearsed. Its too loud in parts if one sets the volume to hear the softer very quiet segments of the score. Chandos Records are known for the quality of their recordings but this disk would also be a bad introduction to Chandos. I prefer Haitink/Concertgebouw. It leaves its imprint on you even years after having heard it."
2,not the best,"Not the best book out there. If you are interested in finding out if meditation and spiritual guidance can help you solve your dogs issues, than get this book...good luck. If you are serious about dog training and rehabilitation, I recommend the following:- The Other End of the Leash by Patricia McConnell- On Talking Terms with Dogs: Calming Signals by Turid Rugaas- Cesars Way & Be The Pack Leader by Cesar Millan- The Dog's Mind by Bruce Fogle"
2,Disappointing,"It's a clever concept and yes his prose is a bit florid, but generally entertaining. Yet, the execution leaves much to be desired. There just isn't much in here which is new or groundbreaking. Also, I've been a professional ancient historian for many years and I have never seen a classicist with more venom towards Hector's character."
5,School Dayz,"This is an excellent video. It relies on realistic (however sometimes ...) depictions of high school life. It shows the lives of those who were picked on in school, the drug problems with teenagers and the ever-wonderful, tragic love story."
4,Grieving a Mother,I found this journal/book to be very helpful in dealing with grief over the sudden loss of my mother. The introductory sections described exactly how I was feeling and the pages to journal give space to get feelings down on various subjects. Using the book helped to remember the good times. I would recommend it to anyone going through this process. I actually felt a bit better after working through it using the book.
1,"I Remember You, A Grief Journal","I returned this book as I could not see a journalistc advantage, to research and acknowledge a process through grieving."
2,Not as good as mini sour crawlers,"When I purchased this item, I thought that it would be like the mini sour crawlers that you get at grocery store (5 oz. packages). They're not. They're bigger, but not as sour. Tastes ok, but not as good as the mini ones. But taste is subjective, so you might love these bigger sour ""worms""."
3,Good,These are good but they aren't the mini sour Brite crawlers. I didn't know they came in full size until the arrived. They taste slightly different but not too much.
1,Not sour,"Maybe its because I'm used to sour patch kids, but these did not taste sour at all! Still okay, just not sour enough for me."
4,Learning book,"This is a young child's text book. And, as far as those things go, it's quite thin. Make sure you haven't got a really marked up book, because you might want to enjoy some of the mystique of 'solving the questions'. I like it's fairly simplistic statements to be solved. Could be quite fun."
3,Good fun reading if you like Deepak's non-fiction stuff,"This is Deepak's second try with fiction. I am just not sure why I like it.I would recommend it to anybody who has done trainings with Deepak. Or for those who are fascinated by this teachings. And, boy, he is a very good teacher. His books, tapes, CD's and trainings about the mind/body connection are groundbreaking and practical. This book will help you in learning more and deeper. As a learning tool this is effective.As fiction... as a novel to read, with a glass of wine beside the couch? I am not sure. I like his entertainment efforts in poetry and music much better.The story is revealed in some other reviews, so I leave it right here and now:Good foor students and Deepak-fans,...forgettable for other folks.Go out and buy his CD with Dave Stewart though."
1,Good performance....for a while,"I have gone through two of these batteries in my laptop. They work like a dream for almost a month, depending on how frequently they are used and then cause the computer to malfunction. All of my lights came on and stayed on and I had no sound for as long as the battery was in. But if I removed the battery, problem solved! I would not recommend this brand at all. Buy a new battery from your local computer store."
3,COLTRANE DESERVES BETTER,"Resuming JOHN COLTRANE in 1 cd is not a good idea at all, since the man had five transformations in his career.The COLTRANE who played with DIZZY GILLESPIE in the early fifties is a different man than the COLTRANE who was free jazz's best frontrunner along with MINGUS, DOLPHY and COLEMAN.Instead of buying this rehash, you should buy the following albums:ROUND MIDNIGHT with MILES DAVIS;GIANT STEPS which has JOHN finding himself and IMPRESSIONS with ERIC DOLPHY which is the best example of intelligent free jazz.If you like those ,then go to ASCENSION a very difficult album to digest.KEN BURNS i am sorry to say ,is more at ease with baseball and the civil war than he is with jazz."
4,"A good collection, but something's missing","I don't know why it is, but the album I have has slightly different track listings. My copy does not include ""Giant Steps"" .. it says in the booklet that it couldn't be included because of licensing restrictions, although it is on ""The Best of Ken Burn's Jazz"" as well as in the box set, so I am not all that bothered that it is not on here. Also ""Bessie's Blues"" is not on my album, but ""Mr P.C"" is. But apart from those discrepancies, whether there's 2 versions of the same album, I don't know .. but I do know that it is a great introduction to Coltrane. Of course, no one disc can do real justice to such a jazz giant, but I was kind of suprised that nothing from ""Blue Train"" was included here. That happens to be my favourite Coltrane album, and I think they could have substituted ""Mr P.C"" or ""Naima"" for one from ""Blue Train"", seeing as they are both from the same album. The booklet includes an essay on Coltrane as well as some photos."
3,Too Comprehensive For Many Listeners,"This CD accurately reflects the range of Coltrane's career, which spanned from well before the avant-guarde phase of jazz into the thick of the avant-guarde jazz era. The problem is that whereas cuts 1-6 are beautiful, sweet, and melodic, the later cuts are from Coltrane's avant-guarde period and therefore, by definition, harsh and non-melodic and rather atonal. I would have preferred that Coltrane's avant-guarde period be represented by only one or two short songs and more of the CD be devoted to Coltranes melodic ballads. For this reason alone I subtract two stars because, presumably, those who are into avante-guarde are a minority of the listening public these days."
1,Not impressed,"The 1573 is good for phone testing and RJ45 Cable mapping but very limited as a tone probe for RJ45, unless optional equipment is purchased."
2,Don't Buy,I've had this for about 2 years and hardly use it because it sucks.The tone/probe is a joke and I can never hear the tone in a server room or even quiet places.I have even tested it just over a 25ft Cat5 cable and could barely hear it.The cable tester is good but thats it. Product feels cheap plastic and uses 9-volt batteries and a cap that you need to removed with a screw driver!!!I would sell mine for 10 bucks to get rid of it. Want it? :)
4,"Good product, but a note on toning out CAT5 cables","I have used one of these for 2 years now and am very pleased with it. One thing I found though is when toning out a Cat 5 cable, plug the adapter into the RJ11 port then make sure you connect the clips to 2 different colored wires in the cable; IE green and orange, rather than say orange and orange-white. The twist in the like colored pairs serve to cancel the noise the toner produces. I've toned out cables 100 feet or more using this method and a set of these; I found a Cat5 jack with wires on the back I keep in my bag to trace out cables that already have connectors installed."
4,It does the job,"I got this for wiring projects around the house. The toner works fine, and the cable tester is handy. The toner isn't particularly strong- you can't trace through walls, for example- but I have had no problem tracing cat5 or alarm cables back to the source with it. I'd recommend for the DIY weekend warrior."
1,Junk...,"Cable testing is okay, but I bought this thing for Tone/Probe. Let's just say it doesn't do the job well at all. Not once have I been able to tone a CAT5 with this device, even after making sure the batteries were fresh. Very disappointed."
2,Lousy,"Despite the reviews here, I thought I'd give it a try. I'm disappointed, but not surprised. The cable test function is fine; powers each wire sequentially so it can be seen on the remote end. Toning/tracing is hopeless. It explicitly won't work on a live line, so you'd have to be sure both ends are unplugged; useless if that's why you're toning in the first place. The receiver seems to have no filtering on it, so it picks up 60Hz hum if you're within several feet of a power cable. The tone signal is so weak that I couldn't trace more than about ten feet before it was inaudible. It has the ability to apply an unbalanced tone to counteract the shielding properties of twisted pair, but this mode didn't fare any better.I'll be returning this unit and shopping for something that works."
1,All I received in the mail yesterday was an EMPTY envelope! The book was missing. So I cannot review this product,"Yesterday I finally received something in the mail from this Amazon purchase, and it was an empty envelope with a sticker from the local post office saying that the contents were missing from the envelope when it arrived at the local post office. It is my expectation that I will be refunded my total purchase price plus shipping -- or a similar valued product will be sent to me free of charge."
5,Like myth? Sci-fi? Adventure? And yeah...romance?,"Marge Piercy blends the myth of the Golem of Prague with futuristic sci-fi to make a totally entertaining story (whether it's believable or not is not a concern of mine). It's a cliche, but I couldn't put it down. Most of her novels are only a step or 2 above beach-blanket romances, but this one shows depth and research. Her second-best, totally different: ""Gone to Soldiers"" (WWII). Check that out, too"
1,"Ursula K. Le Guin, she ain't","I disliked this book so much that I had to put it down after just 80 pages. As a Jew working in artificial intelligence, I found nothing even remotely compelling about Piercy's description of Jews working in artificial intelligence, and I found her ethnic stereotypes especially galling. The Jewish stereotypes were awful enough, and making the Jewish grandma into a ravenous slut didn't improve things, either. But the way that Piercy stigmatizes latinos by calling the street punks ""ninos"" and having them use Spanish words in their dialogue, made me really sick.Theodore Sturgeon, defending the science fiction genre against the accusation that it is 90 percent crap, replied that _everything_ is 90 percent crap. He was right about that, except that, as the dismal _He, She, and It_, suggests, with science fiction, it's more like 99 percent."
2,Hard Reading,"This book is a very hard book to follow. There are two stories going on at the same time, and it is hard to keep the information separate."
2,Sexist,"This book is very sexist. She is a good author, but her ideas are a bit difficult to take. Very femanistic."
4,A Golem Android In Dystopia,"This is an odd but intriguing book. It's odd because it's clearly SF but just as clearly not written by an SF writer. Piercy is a mainstream feminist with a strong grasp of characterization and (unlike, say, recent Tepper) the ability to communicate her politics without polemics and man-hating.Anyhow, the novel is set mainly in a somewhat dystopic semi-near future, with a portion of the book alternating between the main story in the future and a retelling of the classical golem legend. In fact, the main story is quite clearly an adaption of the golem tale, not only in the notion of creating intelligent life, but in that creation being the defender of a shtetl-like town weathering a pogrom. The ending could be stronger, but the book holds up."
4,"Good study sessions, get the study guide!","The DVDs for Desiring God have 10 sessions that you can go through as a group study, Sunday school class, or just by yourself. John Piper authored the book, and has now expounded on the experience with the DVD sessions. I personally have not read the book before viewing the DVDs. The sessions were able to stand alone without having read the book as a precursor. There is a study guide that you can purchase separately, which I did not have. I believe it would enhance this study when doing it in a group setting.Overall the experience was favorable. I would be interested to do this study again in a group setting with the study guide. I think having multiple perspectives would only enhance my learning and growing experience.I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
4,Great Seminar,"This video series is a great quality recording or film of John Piper teaching his ""Desiring God"" book. The lectures are engaging and the content is convicting.While filled with theology that will make you think deeply about your life and relationship with God it is not on such a high level that non-theologians will be lost. Piper has a way of ""putting the cookies on the lower shelf"" so that anyone can understand.I received this DVD series for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
3,Do you Desire God?,"I watched the DVD version of Desiring God by John Piper and loved it. Although it can be a little dry at times, I felt the material was presented effectevly. I do admit when Piper uses the term 'Christian hedonism,' I was first alarmed that it would be biblicvally unsound. Although i disagree with the use of teh term 'hedonism' i understand what he is talking about. We are to enjoy God and find satisfaction in this life through God. with this i totally agree, i just wouldnt use the term 'hedonism.'I would recommend this for Church Sunday school classes and small group studies.I recieved this DVD for free from Waterbrook Multnoma publishing in exchange for an honest review."
4,Evangelical Resource.,"John Piper is using his celebrated book, Desiring God, to lay out a 10-week Bible study on DVD.Many of the 10 lessons touch on Christian Hedonism.And what is Christian Hedonism? It came from this guy Piper. It refers to the idea that God gets the most glory when humans are satisfied in God. Does that make much sense?If you are scratching your head or if you simply skimmed over that description, you'll want to take a look at this DVD or, at least, read the book.This is a resource for the evangelical circles. Piper uses so much Scripture, you'll think you are watching some professor's lectures at some points.One of the larger points that Piper emphasizes is the idea that God is wanting to chase after us. In many evangelical churches this is old news. But some people may find this DVD a great resource.This DVD was provided for review, at no cost, by WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing"
1,YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME,$99 for a small jar of okra?!! This has to be the worst rip off I have come across in the internet!
5,It's A Great Book ...,"Book is very nicely presented with many great illustrations, pictures, and excerpts from notable authors. Great book for the casual or diehard baseball fan. This book covers the terrific exhibit now showing at New York City's Museum of American History. Check it out. It's very worthwhile."
1,The title should be: How to use IONA's COMet,"This book only helps if you use IONA's COMet to bridge. It tells you nothing useful about the two technologies, and like IONA, is way behind on the CORBA specs."
5,Bunny Hop,My six year old son loved this book. Easy to read as well as fun to read. Good first reader book. Illustrations were good.
3,sufficient,"This product does its job. The handle doesn't seem especially well-built, but I don't use it that often. I would say the quality is good enough.The size is perfect for my cookie sheet.I gave it three stars because the advertising is very misleading. It states that it has a very sharp edge. It is a blunt piece of steel! There is no sharp edge. It is about as sharp as the back of my chef's knife.Overall I would say that it was not worth the price, but it is cheaper for myself to keep it rather than pay shipping to return it. In other words, the value of this item is rather low in my opinion."
2,Item was returned.,Item is not suitable for more aggressive mountain trail biking. Did not feel safe using the bike.
1,Bike,"This bike looked great. Too bad it did not perform as good as it looked. I received the bike via UPS, & I immediately took it out of the box, looked at the directions, & proceeded to assemble it as instructed. After I got the bike put together, I took my black lab Dixie on a walk / ride. When I tried to shift into some of the higher gears it started grinding, & would not go into the gear that I wanted. At that point I shifted down to some lower gears & Dixie & myself made it back home. Later on I tried it again & this time the chain came off. I brought the bike back home, disassembled the bike, put it back into the box, & then returned it back to Amazon A.S.A.P. Other than that it is a great bike. Buy this bike at your own discression, but only if you have knowledge on fixing bikes. Thank You!!!"
2,Great Music Ruined By Poor Sound Quality,"The music on this collection is great for an introduction to Lester Young, but unfortunately there seems to have been no effort taken to remaster the cuts here and everything sounds as if you were playing it on the original 78s. I know some people say you can't give this disc a low rating due to the fact that these are recordings from the 30's and 40's. Well, I say you can when there are other discs out there of the same material with sound quality that is far superior to what is offered here. If you want a good introductory disc of Pres that has a lot of material and is not too expensive check out the album ""Lester Young: From A Cool Perspective."" You get over 40 songs on two discs for around $17 and the sound quality is excellent on all the cuts, especially by 1930's and 40's standards."
3,Ruined by noise.,"I own many CDs of 30s and 40s jazz. Usually the sound has been cleaned up nicely, so you can concentrate on the music. This one is so scratchy, it's hard to listen to. Pity, because the music is terrific and plentyful. Yet, because of the noise, I recommend buying something else (Verve's Jazz Masters #30 is nice, for example)."
1,Terrible sound and unacceptable noise ruins great music,"This is the worst sounding CD I've ever heard. And I own hundreds of CDs of music from this era. Obviously Ken Burns rushed this product to market to cash in on his PBS series, without spending any time or money to find the best sources for this music, or to digitally clean up the sound. You will find much better sounding collections of this music on other CD reissues of music by Lester Young, Count Basie, and Billie Holiday. I have some of this same music on old scratched up vinyl LPs and those stll sound much better than this messed up disc. Obvoid this disc at all costs, but do search out this music elsewhere. These tunes are monumental achievements in the history of jazz. Too bad Ken Burns was content to put out such a horrible sounding product."
4,I'll never look at water in the same way again!,I used this book extensively for a college report on the bottled water industry and found out there is a lot more to water than I thought. I use to take it for granted but now I really think about water and what makes it so unique. The author did a good job of researching and writes on some really exotic brands. It would be fun to have tasted all the waters.
5,"The best, however....","This cookbook is my favorite; however, there is a photograph of a dead pig that definetely could have been left out. Stomach-turning..."
2,Art House Boredom,"Although there are some stunning messages which are clear in this picture, there are also excessive amounts of tedious boredom which penetrate the viewer. The film concerns a young lady who has an incestuous affair with her brother and her spiral into the normalcy of the world, which is perceived as ""lunacy"" by most people. Bergmen toys around a summer beach house in Sweden and uses it as a backdrop to her plight, from enhanced shadows hiding inside an old wrecked ship, to a coming storm, this is a very artistic picture......"
4,Visually delightful,"The strength of this book is the excellent photographs, showing each work from a variety of angles so you can really appreciate the complexity of the sculpture. The commentaries are well written and straightforward. Having read the previous review, I read the Anthony Hughes book too and found its commentaries more complex--well, anyway,more opionated!--but its tiny pictures can't compare to the splendors in this book. Short of a trip to Italy, it was the next best thing!"
5,Stunning,"Truly beautiful over-sized, heavy hardcover filled with high quality color illustrations of all of Michelangelo's works. A great deal fro a complete survey on Michelangelo at under $4 including shipping! The book even features a special printing of the Sistine Chapel on very thin parchment paper, a truly beautiful site! great addition to any library, a must for any lover of renaissance art!"
5,the Most Magnificent!,"I was most fortunate to be in Rome in the early 1950's. Of all the historical high points we visited, the Vatican was by farthe standout. The incredible beauty and detail of the Michelangelo sculpture, plus the paintings and architecture of the entire edifice, are most deserving of the title - the Most Magnificent!Amazon is most commendable for it's packaging and historical data contained therein.Thank You."
3,Not so complete....,"The book is fairly well-written (perhaps a bit too simple), but some of the plates are somewhat disappointing. Also, the author omits the two paintings in the National Gallery, London (one of which, the Entombment, is accepted as a genuine Michelangelo by most scholars). I would recommend instead the book by Anthony Hughes, published by Phaidon."
1,Not what I was looking for,"I bought this book after I read all the good reviews that it had. The problem was that I was expecting a better book in terms of the presentation of it, I mean the size, the quality of the papers and PHOTOS. There are no pictures at all, and I really appreciate the photos in a cooking book. About the recipes, they are good, nothing out of the ordinary. I have a lot of cooking books and there was nothing special in this one."
4,Good Buy...Bad Instructions,"Overall a good buy, but some of the worst instructions I've ever seen! We were missing the supposedly enclosed allen wrenches and 3 bolts, which was frustrating. Although the 1-800 is helpful to get missing hardware, faster just to get them at Home Depot. When you get to the 2 person see-saw, the small bar attachment is NOT too long, as I originally thought. You need to bury it in the ground 6 inches or so for support purposes. The 4 person swing was by far the hardest to put together, because the instructions are not very ""step-by-step"". They dont even offer a completed photo to show you you are on the right track! Luckily my wife grabbed an ""in-store"" swingset guide that compared many models, and happened to have a color photo of this model! Lifesaver!"
1,Did not receive it,"Until today, I have not received the product. I regret the fact that this is taking so long. I hope that it will arrive eventually although I do not believe it at this moment in time. I am not going to pay for an item that they are not sending. If I receive it next week, I will draw back these words...."
2,Tenchi Series? I doubt it!,"Unlike some Tenchi series this one just stinks. The animation is horrible. I'm sorry to diss it this bad but it's true. This is, in my mind, the worst Tenchi series yet... I can't really find anything really good about this. I'd recomend Tenchi Universe or better yet the Tenchi OAV series. The people who did this one didn't do so well with the animation. The plot is acceptable but I've only seen these few episodes. It was very hard to get into."
5,"Good Coffee, Good Price","I'm very happy with this coffee. It's smooth, not at all bitter, but still strong, rich, and flavorful. Better than Trader Joes Ethiopian coffee, and less expensive!"
5,Superb Collection,"Yet another winner from the Ken Burns compilation series. Art Blakey's reputation as a master who constantly challenged himself and the young musicians whom he mentored is well-documented here. Songs like ""Confirmation"" and ""Ms. B.C."" smoke like fire on top of the burning rhythms he supplies. The disk also does a good job of capturing his more loose-limbed, relaxed side, on tracks like ""Doodlin,"" and ""Moanin'"". Wayne Shorter, Horace Silver, Freddie Hubbard and even Wynton Marsalis appear here, all alumni of Blakey's Jazz Messengers, as does Thelonius Monk, on his own composition ""Evidence."" Like Miles Davis, Blakey had a knack for finding talent and developing them, so this disk makes for some very rewarding listening as his changing cast of characters push him to discover new ground, or relax and swing easy. A Tom Ryan"
1,Awful Product Quality/Customer Service,"Product was recieved with a large portion of the chain jet black with tarnish. Sent several e-mails out for return inquiries and have yet to recieve an answer (15 days since first e-mail) Terrible company, would not recommend purchasing from company at this time..."
4,Loved it!,"Over all the show was great. The animation was fun to watch and the characters jumped right into your heart. I was a little sad that this show wasn't dubbed into English, while it has been dubbed into other languages, even though the story takes place in England. This bundle version comes with some booklets that further informs you about the characters as well as the time period the story is based. Even my mother borrowed the show to watch it after seeing my sister and I watching an episode."
4,review,"its great to have several books about finding work in today ecomony, i like this one alot, easy to read and apply"
4,Hard to find Bisquick mix,"I was pleased to be able to order this Bisquick mix because the stores in our area no longer carry it. We love these honey flavored bisquits, but will be hard pressed to use all 22 before the expiration date. I ordered them in the middle of March and they have a June expiration date. It would be good if the expiration date was longer or if it was given in the product description."
5,Truly yummy!,"My family absolutely LOVES these biscuits! They're quick, easy, and don't even need anything added to them afterward since there is honey in the mix!"
4,"great for skype, the updated 2 in 1 program really helps with improving skype",works really well with skype. you have to know how to set up the audio. but once set up it really works great.
4,It works good,"I got this phone with the one that connects to the computer and the phone jack. I can use either phone with my land line or my skype at the same time.The only problem that I have is that some times when I open applications on my computer, the program that that allows skype to communicate with the phone closes, so I have to open it again."
2,troublesome,"Difficulties setting up with Windows Vista and server. Updates from Windows disabled the phone software, now doesn't communicate with Skype."
2,Skype good landline not so much,"I agree with the others. When speaking on skype its fine however with the landline people tell me I sound low, garbled, slurring and so on. I would not reccomend this phone for landline calls"
4,Choir Boys,The Choir Boys are quite amazingThe music selections are excellent choices for themThe Supporting Choir did well and added the sound background for the sopranos.They should produce more CDs and also publisise their work more.North America is losing out on such fine and ispriation music.
5,Outstanding voices,"This is one of the best boy treble voice CDs I have heard in a long time. I am familiar with Ely, Kings, Jesus College Chapel Choir, Southwell, and other's. They are all great resources for such talented singers. ""Tears in Heaven"" and ""Miserere"" count as my personal favorites. All songs are fabulous. I love Purcell. The bonus track of Ben Inman (Fairest Ilse) is certainly worthy of the Trebby 2006 award. Look at his web site http://www.beninman.com and vote for Ben."
1,What a Joke!!!,This book was terrible. I can't believe anyone would need such simplistic advice about a 401K plan. Save your money.
1,No Wonder....,Clay Dietz works for Michael Scarborough...no wonder he wrote such a glowing review of this book. I wonder how many other of these 5 stars reviews are posted by employees?
3,Simple and functional addition to home kit.,"I purchased this Blood Pressure kit after taking a Wilderness First Aid course which touched on long term patient monitoring in a field environment. Blood pressure was introduced as a trend to monitor in extended situations where higher level professional care may be delayed. As a member of my local CERT Team, it also seemed appropriate to add to my larger home kit for a situation where someone with more training and skill may be available but not have the equipment.At a recent training session, this kit seemed comparable in quality and construction to other kits and completely suitable for the task. I am able to reliably take BP's and the kit seems like it will stand up to some use. I'll try to report back in after the major earthquake and let everyone know how it holds up!"
4,Have used a longtime,"I bought this pad in 2005. I originally bought it for gaming and have now moved on to other pads, but still use it at work for normal desktop usage. It is solidly constructed, but i does get dirty quite easily. It is easy to clean. It is durable, but the surface does wear down over time. The surface area is too small in my opinion."
4,Great surface but needs more traction!,I have owned this mouse surface for several years now and I have many good things to say about it and an area or two that could use improvements.First it is slick and my Logitech gaming mouse slides across this thing with ease. Having two surfaces to choose from is nice as well.Mine came in a nice metal case and it's fit and finish are excellent except for the clip that holds the mouse wire could have been designed a bit better.The only other thing is that my desk is glass (worst thing for traction) and this thing will not stay put in heavy use while gaming.I periodically clean all surfaces and that helps some with the movement.I know making anything sit still on glass is a tall order so all in all I love this thing and I do recommend this product!
4,Great if you don't have a Laser mouse,This mouse pad is awesome! has both sides which are great and have good texture.CONS:Like the title said it doesnt work with laser mouses. I have a Wolf King Trooper and it doesnt work at all. But i toss my Logitech mx510 on it and it works great. I have come to reason its the black. the laser cant reflect on black.DO NOT CONFUSE LASER WITH OPTICAL. works with optical mouses but not laser mouses.
5,Best mouse pad I have ever used!,What can I say this mouse pad works great with my Logitech gaming mouse.I have never found a mouse pad even close to the quality of this.My scores in all my PC games went up.
3,Satisfied,My wife and I are satisfied with this product. It helps to alkalize (is that a word?) our body and lends additional health benefits to our water.
4,When the Well Runs Dry; Prayers Beyond the Beginnings,"Book was used, but in excellent condition. It looks like it's never been used. It arrived within a couple business days. The book itself is very enlightening and positive. It takes a while to read through the theology, but it makes me think, and I think that's a good thing. I would recommend this book to someone who has started a prayer life, but wants to go deeper."
2,"Simplistic, short","This was an interesting book. However, the content was, in my opinion, limited. It was more like an outline with a few details. Information was interesting; but seemed to skim the surface of everyday Amish life."
4,Born Amish Written By An Amish,This is the true story of how one woman made the change and left the Amish lifestyle. It tells of the personal struggles of leaving family and lifetime friends all behind to adventure into a new life and follow one's own convictions. Very well written and informative. You can almost feel the pain this lady went through to start her new way of life!I feel that all books are over-priced and for that reason I give this book only four stars!
1,one womans story not a true portrayal of the amish,"book should be listed as fiction. it is ONE womans ALLEGED story, not a bible on the amsih as some seem to take it. Poorly written and biased, I would not recommend it."
4,When I Was A Young Man,"The book was well written and that it discussed what it was like living in Mid America in the 50's and 60's. It also discussed his experiences in Navy Seal training and his brief time in Viet Nam. I thought that the book was too vague about what he did to earn the Medal of Honor.I did enjoy however, the experiences he discussed about recovering in military hospitalsf rom his wounds from the Viet Nam war. Having had the same experiences made this portion of the book meaningful to me."
1,Way too small to be of any value or use,"The word ""mini"" is underated in this ""playset"". The figures are probably half an inch high, too small to play or to decorate or to do anything, and dangerous too."
3,Helpful,"Shattered Dreams is a helpful diagnosis of what may really be happening when our dreams are shattered. However, it comes across as a one-size-fits-all model. God has many purposes for allowing dreams to be shattered. Read Crabb to learn one such purpose, but realize that others exist."
4,CAUTION... Not for the faint hearted...,"This book hits you between the eyes... it is not a salve to make wounds feel better. It will get you in the gut, and often... particularly if you are already wounded looking for a ""magical answer""... you will feel worse than better. It will probe your darkest thoughts of God... and yet, if you are ready for some reality & real balance in the quest of healing... Crabb will get you working. It took me two reads to find some hope with this book. I highly reccomend following this one up with ""Abba's Child"" by Brendon Manning. It is the balance to the work of finding spiritual health & answers for the broken."
5,Shattered Dreams,"Next to the Bible, I really think that everyone should read this book. Seriously, Larry Crabb is a genius. With a simple premise of handling disappointment in life, Crabb uses this book to look at suffering using the book of Ruth. (Well, more accurately the story of Naomi). However, instead of explaining suffering away in a ""God will do good, and its because sin still exists in the world"" he really enters into the cause and solution, walking through the ""ok-ness"" of pain. He likens Christianity's attitude of suffering-- minimize the hurt and truck through it till things are ok again-- to an attitude of buddhism. Rather, he states we are called to enter our pain. We serve a God who knows every emotion we hold and a Savior who shared in our suffering so he may know us deeper. Regardless of if life is wonderful or painful, I'd recommend reading this book. It's great challenge to look at your understanding of God and expectations of his character."
5,changed perspectives,"this book had changed my perspectives in pain. it taught me that God uses pain to draw closer to Him, and that we only need to run to Him when our hearts are acheing in pain. Very much recommended."
1,I considered it worthless,"This book was a required reading in Bible College for the Poetical Books class.To better understand my review, I must first state that I am a very conservative, non legalistic Bible believing Christian.That being said, I would not recommend that anyone read this book or anything else written by Mr. Crabb. This book certainly does not esteem God's Word in an absolute manner and in my view promotes humanism. If my memory serves me correctly, Mr. Crabb even portrays our relationship with God as a sexual experience.I cannot browse this book again to write a more detailed review because I literally destroyed the book as I was reading it.I believe that Larry Crabb is false in his theology and views concerning God, humanity and the absolute nature of God's Word. This book is probably better accepted in more liberal theological circles."
3,Thought-provoking and controversial,"I bought this book because a friend recommended it, and we were looking for a new book in my Bible study group. This edition of the book has an eight-week workbook included, which lends itself well to a weekly Bible study format. I read the book and liked Crabb's examination of Naomi's role in the story of Ruth; every other study of Ruth that I've read focuses on Ruth herself. Several of the members of my Bible study, however, were turned off by Crabb's emphasis on the redemptive power of suffering. Nevertheless, the book proved to be a stimulating springboard for discussion. If you are looking for a book that makes you feel good, this is not the one. On the other hand, if you're looking for a book that challenges your preconceptions and forces you to think, you've come to the right place."
2,Bad production.,"The first two cuts blare out of the speakers, then you have to turn the volume up once or twice over the remainder of the cd to hear her voice properly. And there is virtually none of her phrasing, bending and playing with notes on this cd. While I don't know if these are the best choices of her songs, this cannot be the best single cd collection of her songs. I regret buying it."
5,Magnificant,"If you are not familiar with her music, this is one of the fine selections on a CD that one should own."
4,Shostakovich with all the edges rough,"Jarvi's reading is glaring and hard-edged, bringing out the mechanistic side of this enigmatic work. He makes it sound like a raw industrial symphony, which is an exciting approach. His Scottish orchestra is a bit thin, and the recorded sound has some glare, so one can't expect the refined, sophisticated sound that is available from Haitink, Chung, and Gergiev--I prefer all those recordings over this one. But the Fourth is the hardest of Shostakovich's symphonies to carry off, and Jarivi's rawer approach is convincing."
4,A fun read if you are interested in Montana cowboy lore.,I bought this because my Great Grandpa is a good guy in one of the essays. The book provided more detail on the family tale. The book is well written and a fast read.
5,Great collection of stories,"This is a great collection of stories about some truly despicable characters in Montana's history. In the introduction, the editor explains that the work, ""legitimately falls within a strong Montana tradition of looking with irreverence at our predecessors."" Being raised in a state with its own share of characters who make me cringe, I found the essays in this book liberating to read. We can look at the jerks in our history for what they are while moving forward. The essay on Calamity Jane by Jon Axline was particularly well-written as was ""Missoula's Murderous Madam: The Life of Mary Gleim,"" by Jodie Foley."
3,"somewhat interesting, but not as good as expected","You will be repeled by some of the subjects in this book and bored by others. This is a collection of essays by different authors, each proceded by a summary. Sometimes the summary would have been enough and the actual essay could have been skipped. I kept ""wanting more"" for each jerk covered."
2,Is there an orchestra here???,"Very disappointing. If you are the conductor's mother, you will love this DVD. You get to see lots of close-ups of him. Occasionally you get to see close-ups of individual symphony members as well. Unfortunately, anyone close to the point of focus in the shot is completely out of focus. I watch DVDs of symphony orchestras to feel the sense, the power, of the full orchestra. If that is what you are looking for, you are going to be very disappointed. If you are a relative of the conductor, then this is the DVD for you."
3,Good book - basically a rehash of the first episode.,"ANGEL:City of... wont take you long to finish. It basically is a novelisation of the first episode of the ANGEL series with a few more historical tellings of Angel, Darla, Drusilla and Spike (well worth reading for these). The story was quite bland, hence all the historical padding. All in all though, Nancy Holder did a pretty fine job working with what she had."
3,OK for boards review or medical students,"I'm starting a psychiatry residency after being a general practice doc, and want to get up to speed before beginning. This book is in outline format and covers a LOT of material very briefly--which is fine. But it's full of typos, some of which change the meaning of sentences in important ways! And the numerous tables are done in a font so small that even with good eyes I have trouble reading them. To me this is a good book to review for the psych part of the boards, or for a medical student on psych rotation."
1,Unreliable Source,The Saddocks do bad job in the section on ME in the unabridged textbook with many falsehoods included and also in the concise textbook ME is not addressed except en passant as the only disease mentioned as being associated with mixed depression/anxiety which is misleading to say the least. I expect they do a similarly bad job here. This book will get a five star review once authors include accurate info such as that in the Canadian Consensus Criteria on ME/CFS.
2,VERY generic,"The patterns in this book are VERY VERY basic and boring. If you have no experience at all with a scroll saw, it may be worth the money. The patterns look like a grade school student made them. I only have a little bit of experience and every pattern is way below my skill level."
2,Not my type of book but may be for you,"I had a hard time reading this book. The points expressed by the authors are interesting but I like books that spell things out more clearly. I found this book hard to read and I didn't find any useful suggestions on how to control anger. I also did not like the format that was used of showing example ""letters"" from the authors to fictional patients. I like a more factual books without human-interst stuff. That's just my opinion."
1,"Wow, what were they thinking?","Well, I tried to get the dumb Barbie doll to work, but no matter how hard you try, it doesn't register. Then I realized you have to have a compatible DVD player to have it to work. The problem with this is that the product does not warn you that you need a certain DVD player to play. Anyway, looking at the back of the case, there are only three little mini-games and it actually advertises that there is up to thirty minutes of gameplay. This is a waste of $25. Find another Barbie with flapping wings if you have to."
1,Have never been able to use it,This product never even worked for us. My daughter got it for Christmas in 2010 and it was a total waste.
2,Have to have a doll to play it,"I bought this not knowing that you needed a special Barbie to play the game. I found the Barbie and wouldn't you know it, my granddaughter took it in the bathtub with her and now the Barbie doesn't work!!"
4,"Not for BEGINNER Beginner, But Still Great","I find that when learning a new instrument, it always helps to be able to recognize a tune you're trying to play. That way, you almost immediately know that you're on the right key, and you can go from there. I've only been playing piano for six weeks and I was overconfident buying this book. I have no doubt that I'll be able to play them all in the next few months, as the arrangements are not hard, but beginner doesn't mean BEGINNER. It means ""you can read all notes on the scale and recognize music theory easily""."
5,Great selection of Disney songs,"My 13 year old daughter can't stop playing from this book. I now have to drag her from the piano to get her to do anything. I guess that means it's a good song book. There are a lot of great, more modern Disney songs. I would definitely buy a more advanced version of this book if it were available. Hint, hint. . ."
3,Fun for the kids,"I bought this piano book because I realize the kids don't know the classic Disney songs I grew up with and these would fall more into the groups of songs they know. The title of the book is so long, I didn't see the whole thing, and didn't realize it was an ""easy piano"" book - I'd really like a regular score type book as I play well, but since this book is just for playing while the kids sing along, the difficulty, or lack of, of the music isn't important. The kids like it, so I say the purchase was a success."
5,Great Product,This is a great product. The music is easy but not to easy!! A must buy for any disney fan.
3,A little more difficult than expected,"We bought this for our two kids who are playing level 3 piano and found it to be more difficult that expected. They have lost interest in playing the songs right now, but we hope that in a year or so they my try again."
4,Disney Mega-Hit Movies Piano Songs,"Nice book with lots of my favorite songs, easy to play and translate for my harp. Glad I ordered it."
3,Chord Players Wanna Know,"The book definitely consists of a fun lineup. However, like other reviewers have already mentioned: some of the songs' intros are missing. Two in particular are one's belonging to ""Colors of the Wind"" and ""Part of Your World."" Also, the chord progressions feel somewhat incomplete. There's a pattern in the lack-of-build into final refrains coming out of the bridges. Great songs, great keys to play them in, but the songs could have been arranged with a little more fullness. One chord within a 4/4 measure isn't enough for an epic crescendo, for me."
5,Amazing Findings Of History,"I was greatly intrigued concerning seventh day Sabbath observance down through the ages apparently not interrupted in the ""Dark Continent""! This book has me thirsty for more research on the topic!"
1,"Street Glow LED Tire Lights ""Exhaust Tip Design""","DO NOT, PURCHASE THIS ITEM!! I purchased 4 packages of this item to be used upon all of my bicycles. Items received in a timely manner.Appears ALL of these items are old or have been stored improperly. Total number of batteries received: 12 per package. Total number of live batteries: 0 Total number of dead batteries: 48 Note: EVERY battery had leaked acid. Batteries preinstalled in each unit, leaked causing considerable internal damage. Replacement batteries were all dead with some, having leaked.Removed innerworkings of 1 item, cleaned and installed new batteries and found it to work just fine. Bottom line here? Don't waste your money on this item!"
1,WARNING: This is a tuna byproduct...NOT flavored tuna...,"...with 13 grams of added vegetable fat!!While the label states that it contains 21 grams of protein, it also states there are 15 grams of fat, 13 of which are unsaturated...ie, from added vegetable oil [canola & soy..which have their own health issues].Compare this to G'Day's salmon products [a much fattier fish, BTW] which have only 99 calories for the same size servings!! [They don't add ridiculous amount of vegetable oil to this product for some reason].So, bottom line: this is a very unhealthy tuna fish byproduct...a macerated mess with so much oil added that it is guaranteed to put the pounds on! I got rid of mine...and I am writing this in the hope that others are at least aware of what they are buying. I wonder if the previous reviewers read the labels?"
3,"Ok, but.",Same quality as the others in the line..LP is not a favorite of mine though..I'll stick to the tomato based ones...MJL
1,"cannot use, fall off every 30 seconds on the road",Same problem as many others had with this product. The little metal arm pops open easily and the whole thing breaks down. The designer should real have learned harder in his college mechanics.
2,Do not buy if your car has a spoiler.,"Finally after a little over a year of owning this item, I am writing a review. I use if for two adult bikes on my Mazda which has a spoiler. The design of the rack does not allow for a lot of clearance over the spoiler by the two small metal braces. When I add the bikes, the rack is sitting just barely over the spoiler and when I go over bumps the rack damages the spioler and chips the paint off. Not only that, the rubber padding leaves a mark on my trunk. I wish I spent more money and got a better product. It depends on the car and the weight of the bikes you are trying to transport. If you have a car like the audi TT that is pictured you wont have issues with the metal braces. Transporting three bikes would be not be advised."
4,Great rack for the money!,"I used the site's drop down list to be sure it would fit my car and it does, nicely. I haven't yet tried carrying more than one bike, and while it appears to be well made and up to the task---it just looks like a tight fit for three bikes. Once fitted to the car, it's an easy on, easy off operation. I like it."
1,Damaged my trunk,"I bought this rack based on the favorable review by others. However, the second time I used it, I heard a loud ""clunk"" as I was driving along smooth pavement. I pulled over to the side of the road to discover that the two brackets that fit into the upper arms of the mount had collapsed. As a result, it put a dent in my trunk, and the bike pedal put a deep gouge in my bumper.I reattached the brackets in the holes and continued home. Upon arriving, I discovered that one of the support brackets had *again* popped out of the hole, but fortunately it hadn't completely collapsed on my trunk as before.Very poor design--cannot recommend it!"
5,Fits well and seems durable,I purchased this for my Volvo S60 and it fits the car perfectly! I use it to carry a GT mountain bike and a girls Specialized mountain bike. No problems whatsoever and the rack is quite secure on the car.
4,Bike Rack,Very good price for this Allen 3-Bike Rack which I mount on the back gate of my Chevy HHR.Easy to locate on your excellent Website. In the future will look for other items as the need arises.
5,Does the job it's supposed to do,"I was looking for an inexpensive but durable strap bike carrier for my Subaru Forester and came across this one. The exact same carrier on the Allen website was $110, but when I saw it on Amazon for sale at almost half the price I decided to get it!The box said "" Installs in seconds!"" ...well, not quite. It took me about 40 minutes to get it initially ""installed"", but once the straps are positioned and secured, it does come off and go back on fairly readily within seconds...or at least a couple minutes.It's first official test was to carry 2 bikes on the back of my Forester from Las Vegas to Big Bear Lake. No problems with stability at all! From Big Bear we drove to Santa Monica, and eventually back to Vegas. The carrier remained firmly in place on all legs of the trip, and the bikes remained secure in their braces. All in all, I am pleased with this product."
2,Average,"Item is ok, but had some issues. First off, it didn't fit securely on my SUV which is a Mercedes ML 320. However, this class of vehicle is on the list. Secondly, make sure you weigh your bikes. My 3 bikes did not fit. Too heavy, and it definitely doesn't hold once you're close to 100 lbs.We ended up strapping the bike holder to my Chevy Cruze and it worked fine.But not totally satisfied."
3,Works well but can damage the trunk,The Allen deluxe trunk works with 2 bikes at least but its very important to make sure the tension is balanced between the 4 contact points as even slight differences can mean paint scraping off or dents on the trunk. It seems reasonable stable and serves my purpose of occasional biking trips.
2,Doesn't fit my car as advertised,"I opened the package only to find out that it just barely squeezes onto the back of my car. I am afraid to even try it because it fits so tightly that my bumper might break or the top of the rack will slide off of the 1 inch that sits on the actual trunk. I give it two stars because it has a lot of potential for other car models, just not mine as it said it would. (I have a Dodge Stratus)"
3,bike rack,"i never used a bike rack before. my first time , i needed to bring the two bikes in for servicing. the first time i hooked it up, it seemed easy enough. the trouble was when i hit a bump. the rack jumped down. luckily it stayed high enough not to lose my cargo. the experts at the bike store assisted me and said the tieing the strap end in a knot to secure it would help keep it from moving. good idea, but this didnt work either. i will use it again and see if i can discover the correct solution. any suggestions?"
1,Not as specific,The spec of rack is universal but after I received my order I found the vehicle list which not including my model car.I have to return it because it won't fit my car. I have to pay for shipping fee.Make sure before you place your order.
3,"Caused damage to my bike and car but took care of everything in the end, they stand by their product.","I bought this rack based on the favorable review by others. However, the very first time I used it, I heard a loud ""clunk"" as I was driving along smooth pavement. I pulled over to the side of the road to discover that the two brackets that fit into the upper arms of the mount had collapsed. As a result, it put scratches on my trunk and bumper.I reattached the brackets in the holes and continued home. Upon arriving, I discovered that one of the support brackets had *again* popped out of the hole, but fortunately it hadn't completely collapsed on my trunk as before.Very poor designI think the wind blowing on the bike caused the unit to twist therfore releasing the metal torsion brackets, they need to have a lock to ensure they wont slip out.It wrecked one of the bikes and did plenty of damage to my car which i have all the photos to prove it."
3,low cost bike rack,This is an inexpensive bike rack. It seems sturdy enough but the instructions are not sufficient for a first time buyer.
4,porta bicicletas barato,este producto es de buena calidad. monto mis bicis i en free way no pasa nada es muy resistente yo lo puse en mi dodge neon con colita y quedo perfecta mente
3,Poor design,The design of this rack is really stupid. I had to completely jerry rig it to fit better. It seems pretty stable now but they way it is attached is idiotic. It also essentially blocks my license plate which mean I might get pulled over more often.
1,Not worth the money,"Straps would not hold,and bikes almost fell on the Interstate. Put a dent in the rear door. Do not waste your money!!!!"
4,Good Value!,I've used these types of racks before with success.This rack is working well on my 2005 Buick Lacrosse.You need to pay attention to detail and check it on a regular basis.It was helpful to read other user's accounts of what went wrong.(I would give 5 stars to hitch mounts only and you still need extra safety straps)
3,"Used on Ford Focus 2012, Broke rear glass",I bought this rack aftery buying theAllen Deluxe 3-Bike Hitch Mount Rack (1.25 or 2-Inch Receiver)for my SUV. I was pretty happy with the price and quality of the hitch mount on my SUV.I had to buy soft plastic pads to avoid the rack damaging the trunk paint with the provided brackets. I used very thin (about 2mm) plastics and installed it for a 200 mile road trip (all highway). When I arrived everything seemed OK but that same afternoon the glass broke and the dealer found the cause to be the place where the bracket touched the glass (apparently it doesn't touch but I can imagine it does when opening / closing the trunk).The rack is nice just be careful if the bracket is near the glass.
1,Bike Carrier,"I mounted this bike rack on my 2007 Toyota Highlander. It took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to mount it correctly. Once I figured out how to install it, subsequent installations took only a couple of minutes.While the rack mounts tightly, I am not convinced that this mounting would hold three bikes securely on a long highway trip - I am limiting its use to short in-town trips.UPDATEAfter using this a few time around town, I really can't recommend this product. It us just not secure enough. After those few initial tries, I have decided not to use it any longer."
3,"Decent, not perfect","Easy to set up and held securely in high-wind over long trip. The down side? It scratched the paint on my trunk. The bar that sits on top of the trunk doesn't have enough padding to keep the middle from scratching once loaded. We had two adult bikes...I imagine if we'd added a third, the scratching would be worse."
1,Disappointing and Returned,"Upon initial inspection the rack appears strong and sturdy. The tie straps are cumbersome and you really have to work to fit the bike frame into the plastic housings. Once installed and set up with 2 bikes attached, it seemed very sturdy and ready for travel. After about 45 minutes on a busy parkway, the metal braces that hold the rack in its extended position popped out, causing the rack to slump down onto the bumper of the car, nearly dragging to the ground. Thankfully I noticed immediately and was able to pull over before the bikes and the rack went flying and caused a major accident. (As my son was in the car behind me, this anguish was multiplied.) We were able to continue the remaining 2 hours, with extreme caution, and with the braces heavily taped into place. Needless to say, the rack was returned immediately. Really disappointed as it looked to be a good product."
5,It's simple,My husband purchased this saying it was the most simple design. It has worked well for our family - 2 adult bikes and a small kids bike w/ training wheels.
3,Check Allen's website to see if it fits!,"Arrived quickly in great packaging, looked sturdy, had high hopes, and... it didn't fit.Be sure to check every Allen model against their website: [...]To be returned for another. Sigh."
2,Might be OK for a single bike on an older car.,"I've had one of these racks since March of 2009. I've quit using the rack completely, partly because it was tearing up my car and partly because it does not hold bikes very securely. Detailed complaints:1) The rack is stated to carry 3 bikes but it is not big or strong enough to do so. It carries one bike OK.2) The rack lacks side straps (it should mount with 6 straps not 4) so it has no lateral support (it will shift sideways in a sharp turn).3) The upper trunk clips scratch up the trunk (other brands have thicker rubber on the clips).4) The lower clips dig into the bumper.5) The rack includes no method of securing the lower portion of the bicycles so the bikes swing in the cradles.6) The lower bumper put serious dents in my trunk!!!7) The rack requires an adapter when trying to carry a woman's bike that lacks a proper top-tube.Save your money and get a hitch mount!"
1,Don't buy this rack,I bought this rack at Walmart and wish that I had read the reviews first. I put the rack on in my garage with two bikes on it and then started to take them off when the two supports popped out and the rack collapsed scratching my trunk. After reading the reviews and seeing that this is a common problem I am VERY glad that I didn't try to drive with this rack installed. I'm sure it would have cause a lot more damage to my car and bikes. I returned it to Walmat for a refund. This is a very poorly designed rack and not safe for use. This product should be recalled!!!
4,Gets the job done,"The product works fine, it secured my bike (~25lbs) to the rear hatch of my 2005 Scion xB from Chicago to Cincinnati (about 300 miles). There are a few design problems though, for one, the hooks that hold the rack to your car are made of uncoated metal! I expected them to be coated in rubber or some other non abrasive material but the metal hooks are highly prone to scratching your vehicle at the restraint points. Which is why I used a layer of an anti-skid drawer sheets (bought at a dollar store). The ties that secure the bike to the rack are also quite flimsy. The little buckles are made of a cheap plastic but the strap is made of a solid material. I tied my bike to the rack with some rope (also bought at the dollar store). Overall it is a solid bike rack but lacks attention to the finer details."
3,Allen Deluxe 3-Bike Trunk Mount Rack,"This was the least expensive 3-bike rack at amazon, I didn't have big expectations from it. On the first trip, I loaded 3-bikes and I had to stop after 10 miles to secure the bikes. It is okay for two bikes or if you purchase additional tie-downs to secure the bikes it would be useful. I end up buying tie-downs, now I can carry 3-bike without any problems. I hope it will help you.."
4,Just the thing for the job,"First, the grain of salt is that I haven't tried many other products in the category. That said, it worked great and is easy to use on multiple car types that I've tried."
5,Great bike rack,"Great bike rack, especially for the price. This rack did an outstanding job on my most recent trip. Held the bikes secure. Tis is an excellent rack for quick in town or long drives. Highly recommend this bike rack for anyone interested in saving a little money but getting an excellent product."
1,Too flimsy,This rack is way too flimsy. Almost fell off my car on the freeway. Returned it and bought a real one from rei.
3,Cool product but not for longer rides,"it had worked all well for short trips but once we tried to take it for almost 3 hrs ride, withing an hour the bars got shifted and the bikes were hanging, chipped off paint of the spoiler. Finally figure out the steel hooks came off the position due to bumps on the road I guess. So the whole rack got shifted and was hanging. I figured out to tie the straps along the steel hooks too to prevent the hooks from coming off during bump or windy situations. That prevented for future carry ons, but I am certain that this is not suitable for longer rides. Just use to nearby trails not interstate drives. Good luck."
4,Love it but does not fit childrens bicycles,This product does great on my 2008 Nissan Sentra. My road bike fits wonderfully and does not wobble. I did not feel at all like it was time consuming or a lot of work to put it on the trunk. Pretty simple actually.
4,Allen Bike Rack,I love it... The only negative thing is the grey padded tore within a week... and I had to tape it to keep it together
3,Doesn't hold 3 bikes,"This product works, but it doesn't hold 3 bikes. It only holds 2 max!! Also it chipped the paint off my bumper... Not all that pleased with this product. It functions but its not all that great."
4,An inspiring book about a down-to-earth woman,"Marjorie Hinckley became one of my heroines after reading this book. She's so down to earth and cheerful. What put me over the edge was the way she encouraged her grandchildren to read. When she recommended The Agony and The Ecstasy, I was sold on her character. I'm not a big reader of Church books, or biographies, but I loved this book."
3,Missing scenes,Kudos to Amazon for their fast service. Customers should be aware that there are several scenes from the original movie that are missing on this DVD. This is one of my favorite movies that I've seen at least half a dozen times before. An example is the one where they are trying to teach Mountain how to wrestle and he keeps losing his cool and punching the other wrestler. Another is where Maish confronts Ma Greeny and tell her he wishes she wasn't a woman and she retorts that's the nicest thing anyone ever said to her. There is no reason for leaving them out and there is no notice that the film was edited for content. The movie rates 5 stars but the DVD only 3 for cutting corners.
4,Rod Serling at his most depressing,"Some movies simply require black and white; color would certainly have spoiled the flavor of this grim story. Anthony Quinn plays a boxer at the dead end of a punishing career. With no skills or experience outside the ring, and a manager who would sell his soul to pay off a vicious gambler, he has nowhere to go until one person sees something more in him and offers a bit of hope. There are people who prefer the Jack Palance version (which was done for TV prior to this full-length film), but the very different ending of this version is more credible."
5,Impressive acting !,"Robert Bresson stated in his notes on the Cinema: ""The important is not what they show me but what they hide me, and above all what they don't suspect that is among them""Precisely in this demolisher drama Anthony Quinn makes one of his supreme artworks, playing the role of boxer in free fall. The progressive process of decadence and moral wreck is shown with impeccable precision and convincing dramatizing mood.To my mind Ralph Nelson shaped this minor jewel in the Pantheon of the immortality. It will never be reminded among the Greatest Films in any age ever filmed but its inner honesty overpasses by far, many superior films."
5,Amazing and truly moving!,"I bought this as a gift after watching it myself on a classic movie station. I knew of all the actors in it from other films, but never saw this one previously. I expect stellar from Anthony Quinn and was not disappointed; his portrayal of prize-fighter Mountain Rivera develops depth as the film progresses; big surprise for me in this film was Jackie Gleason playing Rivera's smarmy underhanded fight manager, and Mickey Rooney and Julie Harris as support for Rivera through his career changes. Just an all-around great story of a bit of light trying to brighten a dark world; the ending for which is very similar to life: based on the choices we make. Profound."
3,Nichols and Nyholm is better,"Having said that, this is still useful. OK, it's like reading a 1800's dictionary of Arabic, where the transcription was not standardized; you really have to know some Ojibwa, for this to work. I sent it to a friend at the Teaching Drum wilderness skills school in Wisconsin, who was studying Ojibwa. He found it useful, though I will say N & N was somewhat more useful.An Ojibwe Word Resource BookandConcise Dictionary of Minnesota Ojibweare worth knowing about."
1,Color very disappointing,"Sage green is not even close to the color presented on the Amazon site. You get a washed out, sickly looking green that has none of the warm tones represented in the photo."
2,Disappointed,The sheets are too small. I have a normal sized Queen mattress and the top sheet does not fit. It seems like a Full Sheet.
2,Pinzon sheets,"Not happy with the lint on the first washing, I could of had a fire. I haven't used then as yet."
1,"Ordered Cream, got Coffee","In fact, they changed my request to coffee, the one that is on display, so I am guessing, given the price, that they are flogging the coffee and can't get rid of them, hence the change in my order. Before I get the comments on the comments that it must have been my error, no, I specifically chose cream, ensured that I got it on the cart as cream. After that, admittedly, I didn't check to see if there had been a slip between cart and purchase, but come on. Very irritating. I have no use for these and no desire to repack, arrange, make available for return to the deliverer, so I'm stuck with them."
4,"Cosy and warm, better colors though please!","Really nice sheets, but the tan looking color is more gold. Why isn't there a true tan option. More colors please, I'd love a second set!"
5,"Warm, comfy sheets","My hubby and I love these sheets. They are very soft and very warm. We wanted something comfortable but also warm enough for northern winters. These definitely are going to be getting a lot of use this winter! We have been using them for several weeks now, and I couldn't be happier with them"
5,Best sheets ever,"I received these sheets very quickly with free shipping! The price was great, I seen simular sheets on other websites for 25 - 50% more. I have washed them 1 time and yes they did produce a lot of lint but the sheets are as good as when I first pulled them out of the package. They are very soft, warm, and elegant. I feel as though I am sleeping in a five star hotel. I liked them so much I orded another set for a Christmas gift."
1,The sheets came off the elastic!,"I washed the sheets a second time and the sheets came off the elastic!I can not believe how these sheets are made! They were certainly expensive enough and they are even quite comfy and warm; I was quite pleased with them, but now I'm left with the job of sewing the sheets back over the elastic! I don't have time for this and I hate to sew! I didn't know I was applying for a job when I ordered the sheets. Unreal.This never happened to any other sheets I've dryed. There is nothing wrong with the dryer. I want another pair of sheets to replace these. I'm really quite annoyed (in case you couldn't tell!)"
3,Dissappointed,"I bought two sets of sheets of 190 gram but now they are like 140 gram because they lost a LOT of flannel in the dryer, so I am dissappointed in these sheets after paying a good price for them."
4,Very Soft and Cozy,"I bought these as back up sheets when I am washing my Sheex sheets. But when they arrived, they went into rotation with my other set especially in the cold winter months. These flannel sheets are so soft and cozy that you really don't want to get out of bed.The set comes with two king size pillow cases, a flat sheet and a deep set fitted sheet. They are very soft and after we washed them we did find some lint, but nothing extravagant or major to talk about. We put them on the first night and felt very comfortable using just the fitted and flat sheets as blankets. They are so thick and soft, yet light enough that they do not tend to pull you down.The color seems to hold and I have no pill to speak of. At $65.00 a set, this price point makes these an excellent buy. I am going to run these through the wash a few more months and see how they hold up and if they keep impressing me like they are right now, I will most likely be buying a few more sets for next winter."
5,DOES NOT PILL,These sheets are awesome. I don't care what anyone says. These sheets do not pill at all. Ive had them for several months and the still fell amazing
5,High-quality flannel and excellent construction,"I ordered these sheets in the middle of our snow and ice storm here in the Pacific. I've never liked flannel sheets because the bottom sheet usually doesn't stay fitted and ends up with big wrinkles under my legs and feet. These soft but heavy sheets stay put once made. The only problem was the color -- the CREAM sheets I received are much more yellow/brown than shown in the photo. I had hoped they would be a lighter off-white, but am totally satisfied. They wash and dry well, no shrinkage. Hopefully our ice and snow melts soon!"
5,Great sheets!,"These flannels are sturdy, heavy, and cozy. They haven't pilled at all that I can remember. Will eventually buy other colors. They beat Land's End I think. No complaints!"
5,Soft and comfy,"Love the set! Very soft and comfortable, which makes it hard to get out of bed. Just as it's described. Purchased the duvet to go with it"
4,"Really nice quality, but could be wider","I bought these sheets for my 16 year old son's queen sized bed in January, so I don't know how they will wear long term, but they are the thickest, softest flannel sheets I've ever seen and he absolutely loves them! Expensive but worth it IMO. I wish they were a little wider because they cannot be tucked in on the sides, but my son doesn't care. I would give them 4 1/2 stars if I could. Would buy again for $54.00."
3,160 was a better value,190-Gram is thick and warm. But I think 160 ones are just as good but with better price.
5,Heavenly Slumber Sheets,"Love, Love, Love these Pinzon sheets. Washes nicely, very soft, warm, cozy and snuggly comfortable. The reviews on these sheets are spot on. I plan on buying a few more of these sets before the winter ends. Great investment for this quality sheet set and well worth every penny and more. GREAT buy!!"
4,Great comfortable sheets - wash and wear well a year later,We've bought 3 sets of these sheets in different sizes for us and our parents. Colors aren't always true but the sheets are comfortable and reasonably long lasting.
2,Sheets great for first few weeks,"My husband and I absolutely love these sheets, however after washing them for the first time and putting them back on the bed, the fitted sheet ripped quite easily. I immediately stitched the rip on my sewing machine and we are continuing to use the sheets which are great for cold winter nights. Just disappointed that they were not better quality resisting tears."
5,Very soft sheets,"These are great sheets, the more you wash the sheets the softer they are. I would recommend these sheetsfor everyone."
5,Soft & Cozy,"My ex-boyfriend bought these flannel sheets a couple of years ago and we both really liked them. So when he asked me to move out, the first thing I did was order the exact same sheets in a another color. I washed them once before using and as expected the lint catcher was full after being in the dryer. Tonight was my first night sleeping on them and so very glad I got them!!!"
4,"No pilling, whole in top sheet","Love these sheets. They are thick, velvety soft, and warm. The best feature is that they do not pill. Unfortunately, I had to give the item 4 stars instead of 5 because the top sheet came with a quarter size hole in it. I could have returned the item, but it wasn't worth the hassle. Check your sheets closely for holes and immediately upon receipt; returns are accepted within 30 days if there is a problem. They tend to shed a lot in the dryer so I hope they maintain their softness over time."
5,Velvety flannel sheets,"The Pinzon flannel sheets are like sleeping on velvet! They are soft, warm, and comforting on our cold Montana nights. We got one set, used them for a week, and ordered a second set. They are also very wide, so they drape a good 12 inches on either side of our Cal King bed, so they keep out the cold air even when one person rolls over and takes a bit more than his/her share of the sheets. Would we buy them again? You bet!!!!!"
4,Very warm,"This is my first set of flannel sheets. I'm very pleased with their warmth and the way they tend to ""stick"" to other blankets (there's really nothing sticky about them, it just seems that if I make the bed they don't get bunched like lighter cotton sheets do). The cream color is a few shades darker than pictured, thus the 4 stars."
5,Ready for Winter,"I LOVE these sheets. I have had them for a month or so and have washed and used them multiple times. They are incredibly soft - I don't want to get out of bed in the morning. They wash up well - no need to iron and they haven't pilled up at all. The color is also really nice - very rich, and it has held up during washing. These are the best flannel sheets I have ever owned."
5,Love these sheets!,They are amazingly soft and warm! I want them in every color! I highly recommend them.They did have an odd smell when they arrived but after the wash they were fine.
5,Soft and Durable,Sheets are soft and warm. Purchased the sheets over a year ago and plan to purchase again this year to have an extra set.
5,Best Sheets I have owned so far.,"I have been looking for some decent sheets at a good price point for awhile. I can truthfully say that I have found these sheets to be the most comfortable and soft from all the other sheets I have used over the years. I didn't notice any issues with the stitching and the sheets fitted well. The sheets are slightly thicker than my previous sheets, and I havent had any issues with sweating during sleep. The pockets were deep enough for our bed, which did help the sheets from not forming lumps during the night. I would definitely buy another set for future use. if your on the fence about wether to get these or not, I would say that you should try them out."
5,Best sheets for winter,"Just like butter, love the sheets. I don't think I could go thru another winter without climbing in between these sheets."
4,velvet flannel sheets,"these sheets are very soft and washed very well the sizing was also very good, I'm pleased with this purchase"
3,velvet flannel sheets,"We like the feel of these sheets, and they fit our king bed very nicely. However, after washing them, the color has faded in spots. The dryer lint catcher has filled up each time after the sheets have dried. I'm glad I bought the light colored sheets. If I had bought a darker color then the color fading would have looked worse."
5,Love going to bed,"These sheets are proof, like beer, that God loves us and wants us to be happy.They're worth the wait.<-4 more words were required."
4,Good Choice,"I'm very pleased with these sheets. The color is darker in person than the photo would indicate. Fortunately, they still look good with the rest of my bedding. They're nice and warm, especially when you first climb into bed on a cold winter's night. The feel is soft and nice. Overall, I'd say they're good."
4,Warm sheets,I previously purchased two sets of these sheets in Dec. one as a present for our adult daughter and one for our vacation condo in the mtns. I then decided that we needed a set on our bed at home. If you do not use an electric blanket these sheets are great in the winter as they are not cold like regular cotton sheets. They are soft and very comfortable. They do pill and release lint when washed. Too early to tell how bad the pilling will be. Stay tuned!
2,Very Disappointed,"We were looking forward to these flannel sheets made in Portugal because during our research we found that 190 gram sheets were higher quality than the lower gram products. After washing them and sleeping on the sheets for a month, we have found a lot of pilling on both the top and fitted sheets. These bits and pieces get on everything and on my carpet as well. I don't know what causes this problem but I plan on returning them."
5,Perfect,"I was very skeptical about purchasing these sheets, But I read all the reviews and they sounded like what i was looking for.Well I have to say these are the best sheets i have ever purchased. After washing they still fell new. No pile of little balls all over,They are perfect. I liked them so well I have ordered me a seconds set. Very pleased with these sheets."
3,"Flannel , yes, but not very plush.",This set of sheets is a little disappointing in its thickness. Definitely better at avoiding the chill of summer sheetsbut the pile is very short and not quite as cosy as anticipated.Would not recommend to a cold-sensitive friend.
5,Very comfortable,"To quote Aziz Ansari: It's like sleeping in lotion.Fits my deep queen as well, so no complaints at all. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys this type of material."
5,Comfy! This is a keeper!,"Happy with this sheet set. Decent quality. The color is not quite as shown, but it still works for me. The fit is good.One reviewer wrote that his or hers did not shed lint when laundered. Mine did, but they are still thick and strong."
5,"Soft, warm, and they fit","I bought the cheaper Pinzon flannel sheets a year ago and was disappointed how poorly they fit my 13"" mattress. These 190 gram sheets are wonderful for a couple of reasons.First of all, they are quite soft and much thicker. Secondly, they fit my mattress. The top sheet could be a little longer but the fitted sheet stays on no matter how much I toss and turn. The pillow cases fit my king pillows perfectly.There is the usual lint after washing and drying them but nothing extreme and they didn't shrink to the point of being unusable. I was pleasantly surprised at how much softer they are than my old sheets. Very nice.When I bought mine, there were different prices depending on the color I chose, so beware!"
4,Great product for the money,A bit thinner than my other flannel sheets but definitely worth it for the excellent price.
4,OB1,"I have to agree with a few people who said they have more of a ""Felt"" feel. They are thick and smooth. They also seem to be softening up after each wash. There is a ton of lint in the dryer after each washing. But absolutely no ""Pilling"". For the money, though, I have not found anything close to this quality."
5,So soft and comfy!,Bought these sheets because of the great reviews. These reviews were right! Sheets wash up really nice (no piling) and are so comfy. We bought them for use on our boat but I have since bought another set for home.
2,Pillow cases feel horrible.,"I've never had cause to complain about linen before, apart from shirts, though these feel a bit weird particularly against my face, though weirdly OK rest of body. Will probably bin the pillow cases. You may do something else."
5,Pamper yourself,"I was in a mood to indulge myself when I ordered these. We are experiencing a cold autumn this year and these flannel sheets are just what I needed. So warm and soft, they will make you feel pampered. My old flannel sheets, from Kohl's, have held up well but they were never as soft as these. I hope these remain as nice through repeated washing and drying.Note: Several weeks after purchasing these, I received a gift of flannel sheets ordered from Overstock.com. Overstock's heavy German flannel sheet set is not nearly as heavy or as soft as these sheets from Amazon."
4,LOVE THESE SHEETS!,These sheets are everything and more! They are a heavier fannel blend than I thought so i dont know if these will be our summer sheets but they are so soft and cuddlely for the winter. They make it hard to get up put of bed! We also paired it with a down conforter and that makes the bed! Thanks so much for the amazing reviews bc we searched for weeks trying to find the right sheets :)
5,Awesome Flannel Sheets,Seriously this flannel sheet set is one of the best sheet sets I have purchased!!! So comfortable and very durable - will last more then one winter season. I didn't want to take them off my bed for spring they are so comfy! Worth the purchase!
4,Very nice...,"I bought these sheets as an anniversary gift. I was very well pleased with the quality of the sheets. They are very soft, and seem durable. I plan on buying a set for myself in the near future. The reason I only gave four stars is because I don't know how they've held up after washing, etc."
4,Good sheets for the price....,"These sheets are good for all intents and purposes. However they are very thick, and make you very hot, like sleeping on a towel. Not to say they are not comfortable, because they are, very. I just think these are much better suited for winter to keep you warm than they would be in the summer....P.S. these sheets also have very deep pockets, as they easily wrap around my 14"" mattress..."
1,Poor quality,These sheets pilled after just 1 washing. They also shrank and so were pretty much throwaways. Material not quality. Would not recommend.
3,"Nice sheets, poor shipping","I ordered these beautiful flannel sheets for friends for Christmas. They are nice sheets but unfortunately the company must have drop kicked them, broke the plastic enclosure, and then scuffed them across a dirty floor. I had to wash them before I could give them away. That was a disappointment."
5,Flannel Sheet set,"This is by far the best flannel sheet set I have ever purchased. They are just great, even after washing. They did not shrink or pill up at all. I would recommend them to everyone who wants warmth in their bed at night."
5,"Ooooooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh, Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaby!","These sheets are heavenly! Sooooo soft, these are the ultimate in luxury! Just ordered my second set, because we can't bear to sleep on anything else now that we've tried them. Ordered a set for my very hard to buy for mother-in-law for Christmas, too!"
4,"Scrumptious, but the pillow cases are short","Scrumptious is definitely a good word for this sheet set. They are so soft that I am having trouble getting out of bed for my morning walk in the cold! The only downfall about them is the pillow cases are a bit short. A good sheet set will usually include a standard pillowcase that will cover a queen pillow as well. However, this pillowcase just covers the standard pillow. Great price for the quality though."
2,Not what I expected,"Just bought these sheets and will be returning them as they are not true flannel sheets. I should have known better as the word 'velvet flannel' is used in the description. As the name implies, these sheets really do feel like velvet (or microsuede) - which is fine if you don't care whether you have the real thing or not. But I want traditional flannel for winter so I will keep looking until I find what I want."
2,Sheds tons of fiber,"This sheet set had very good reviews on Amazon. I shop from Amazon all the time, and my decisions are mostly based on user reviews. But I have to say, this time I was extremely disappointed.First of all, the fabric does not feel soft. It does not feel comfortable on skin. But more importantly, it constantly sheds fibers. This gives me allergies and irritation. Even though I washed the set many times, it just keeps shedding fibers and eventually I stopped using them. Is it only me, or did you have a similar issue?"
2,very comfortable but faded with first wash,these sheets are not color fast. they faded in splotches with the first wash. (i purchased the grey.)these sheets are not color fast. they faded in splotches with the first wash. (i purchased the grey.)
4,Flannel Sheets,The first set I have ever owned. Bought a new bed and wanted something nice and warm; these blankets did the job well and are very comfortable.
5,Love them .,"On a cold winters night there is nothing better than climbing into a soft warm bed . These sheets are so warm and yet comfortable, soft and smooth feel. They launder perfectly and fit great . the"
4,Very comfy,"Overall, the quality of the sheets is very good. They are soft, wash well, and are generously sized to fit my thick mattress. The only negative I have is that they pick up a lot of lint and critter fur. Not a huge problem, but it would be nice if they attracted a little less of the fuzzy stuff. However, they are very soft and cozy and that is what I was looking for. (I purchased the Aubergine color - very rich and a good match to the color you see on Amazon.)"
5,Worth every penny!,These are truly the best flannel sheets I have ever owned. They are so thick and cozy and have held up well after being washed. I wondered if they would be worth the cost since they are a bit more then some of the other flannel sheets on Amazon. I'm so glad I took a gamble and spent the extra money! The only problem now is crawling out of such a cozy bed in the morning!
4,"Very soft, but shrunk significantly","I have had bad luck with sheets shrinking, so I got queen size sheets for my full size bed. It's a good thing I did because despite taking all precautions when washing these when I first got them, they shrunk. They fit my 10"" full size bed alright, but would not fit a queen size bed any longer without significant bunching.Since I planned in advance, I am very happy with the purchase, but it's something to be aware of for you all out there."
2,Pinzon Flannel 'Calfornia' King Sheet set,"I bought this set based on the many reviews with plenty of people indicating they bought the ""California King"" size. They said it didn't shrink when washed, didn't pill and fit 'nicely'. I've owned a Calif King since the 80's and the top sheet in this set IS NOT a Calif King - it is a King! It is not long enough to tuck in at the bottom. Buyer beware."
5,Love these sheets!,These are high quality sheets - so soft and warm that I don't want to get out of bed! I highly recommend.
5,By far the best sheets I have ever slept in period.......,"I have had flannel sheets before but man, the first week and they are already pilling. Not these. I will never use another kind of sheets on my bed again. I almost bought some of those supposed (Egyptian Cotton) sheets but finally figured out that they are not Cotton at all but micro fiber polyester junk. So I took the bite and got these instead as they have incredible reviews. You will not be disappointed. I sleep like a baby in these sheets. Very Very nice stuff."
5,feels so good to get into bed with these soft soft sheets,I never knew flannel sheets could be so soft. I can't wait until you get more king size in!
5,Excellent flannel sheets,We are really pleased with these sheets. They are so soft and cozy and even look nice. We have had them for a month or so and washed them several times. They just get softer each time. Seems very high quality. Highly recommended.
4,Pinzon 10-gram Flannel Sheet sets,"Nice, warm, comfortable, heavy weight - I expect a long service life from these. A previous set of flannel sheets from another source and brand failed when the fitted sheet ripped after a short life. That brand has reputation for ripping. Reports on Pinzon 190-gram have all been good but it may take 10 to 20 years for a report on the life of these sheets. I get the impression they will last many, many years.I really enjoy climbing into a bed that will not feel cold even on the coldest days. Now middle of the winter here and multi-day power failures are common in this area so a bed that does not feel cold to the touch is important."
4,Time will tell,"Price is good. Some previous reviews said little lint in the dryer..NOT SO! Had to clean lint filter twice during drying, which took a LONG TIME! Good sign I guess."
5,yum!,"They are soft, soft, soft, warm and cozy. The pockets for the fitted sheet are deep, I really love these.I have only had them for a few days, so I know nothing about durability, but they are soft, I haven't noticed much piling. I did wash and dry them several times before using them, to get rid of the initial lint that seems to come off sometimes with new fabrics, and the amount of lint that came off at first was considerable. Be that as it may, the sheets are very soft, very warm, and except for my not being able to comment on their durability, they are just wonderful."
5,very soft now,"The sheets are lovely and soft. I hope they stay that way after repeated washings (and I hope I remember to update my review later). Like the color, too."
4,"Nice, thick sheets",They are soft and will keep you warm. Tough to beat for the price. Hopefully they will hold up better than the pricey sheets I usually buy.
5,Best sheets ever!,"Mmmmm these sheets are amazing. So soft, warm and luxurious. I love these sheets and use them in the winter months. When I go back to the standard flannel sheets they seem like sandpaper compared to these."
4,They are warm,"On cold nights regular cotton sheets feel cold to me, but these definitely feel much warmer. They feel like flannel pajamas next to the skin. They fit good and snug on my over sized mattress."
5,Pinzon Flannel Sheets Feels Like Your Wrapped in a Cloud,"I've purchased flannel sheets before but none as thick and luxurious as these, even spending twice the price.So thick and soft you truly feel as though you are wrapped inside of a cloud (or at least that what I imagine a cloud would feel like.)The first few times I washed and dried them I had to empty the lint filter of the dryer several times each time and wondered if they would loose too much plushness - but they didn't. They are still ultra-soft and there is absolutely no loss of thickness.The quality of the stitching is amazing for the cost.I can't ever see using any other sheets during the cool weather."
4,Warm,I was totally pleased with these. I was surprised by the weight - heavier than expected and more than my current ones - feels good.
4,Super Soft!,"I love these sheets, they are very soft, thick and warm. The only drawback is that we bought the butter, which was a beautiful, pale gold and looked beautiful with our burgundy comforter, and it is now a strange, blotchy shade of pink. I have allergies, so I use small amounts of bleach and super-hot water to wash my sheets. Apparently the dyes couldn't hold up to it."
2,Poor sewing of the fitted sheet,Received the set promptly after ordering. Washed the sheets before using. Removed the fitted sheet from the dryer and the pockets were coming apart at two corners. Had to sew up the pockets before we could use them. Don't expect the sheets will last thru the up coming winter. Would not buy again!
3,"Soft, a little disappointed","Received these sheets and washed immediately. Ordered the cream and they are more of a butter yellow. They are soft, however after reading many of the reviews, I was expecting more for 60.00. Not worth the amount I paid for them."
5,Best flannel sheets ever!,"I pre-washed these sheets and they filled up the lint trap in my dryer. However, they came out the softest, most comfortable flannel sheets I have ever purchased. I have bought lots of brands, and these are much superior to even the ultra-pricey ones. There was no pilling at all. The fitted sheet has elastic all the way around for a great fit. The corner pockets are large enough to easily accommodate a thick pillow top mattress with room to spare. The flat sheet is generous and long enough to tuck in well at the bottom. The pillow cases are a bit skinny but overall the set is a real winner. I plan to purchase another set and get rid of all of my other so-called flannel sheets! They are 100% cotton so they breathe well as opposed to the polyester fleece alternatives. I didn't know it was possible to be so excited about a set of sheets. Try them- you will not be sorry!"
5,VERY comfortable.,"They don't look ""super fancy"", but as for comfort they are AWESOME. Very soft and warm, like pajamas. Perfect for people who want to snuggle up into comfort. I got the sage, which is actually like a soft, sea foam green (not the typical darker sage)."
5,warm and soft,"I have both these and the 200 gram sheets. It is hard to say that I have a preference. They are very similar. While the 200 gram may be slightly heavier and a tiny bit softer, these are very nice. They feel a little more like traditional flannel but better quality than most. They fit my extra thick mattress well. These are really great sheets for the money. I would not hesitate to recommend them."
5,So Soft and Cozy!,I debated before buying this sheet set but am so glad I did. Great quality and unbelievably soft and comfortable! A real treat to use on cold winter nights. Definitely can recommend these to anyone looking for flannel sheets. I bought the cream color and it matches several flannel duvet covers nicely.
4,The best! except...,"My original review said: These are the softest, warmest, most snuggly sheets ever. I absolutely love them. They are a very subtle shade of green, a little more pastel than I had anticipated, but still very pretty. They are the only sheets I own that easily fit over my tall mattress plus a feather bed on top.Three weeks later, that's still true, except that after two washings, the color is fading away in spots. Lots of spots, and they're yellow. It started with the first washing, and after a few more washings, they'll look tie-dyed. So they're great for me, but I'll never be able to put them on a guest bed.I bought a camel-colored set for my boyfriend two years ago, and he hasn't had this problem, so maybe this is only with the sage green. I will buy a cream-colored set because they are so wonderfully soft and warm, and I assume that color can't change much."
5,VERY SOFT!,Amazing thick soft sheets. Beware washing these with ANYTHING else. About a pound of lint comes off these suckers upon first wash! Otherwise AMAZING!!
5,AWESOME,Exactly what i had wanted! These sheets are warm and super soft. The color is perfect with a brown comforter.
5,a great buy,We had just bought a new adjustable bed for christmas......this was just the thing for the cold winter nights....no more ice cold bedsheets....allows us to lower the t/stat by at least 5 degrees....
5,Perfect for any season!,"We had a set of queen, chamois color for about two years and wore them out. Just ordered a set of smokey blue. These sheets are perfect in both summer and winter. It's hard to believe, but they really are! Durable and no pilling either. They do shed a lot of lint in the dryer, but that's hardly a complaint. I can't wait to get the new set :)"
5,SOFTEST FLANNEL SHEETS,"I have bought flannel sheets for over 40 years and by far these sheets are the best I have ever had. They are incredibly soft, do not pill and are THICK! I can not believe the price either, as their quality is better in every way, than sheets twice the price."
5,Best for winter!,I love this product! This is actually my 2nd purchase of the same product but in another color. It's that wonderful! You won't want to get out of bed on a winter day.I got it on sale. But I'd purchase it full price. It's that wonderful!
5,softest flannel ever,"Bought these for my mother who at 81 gets cold very easily. She is delighted with them. They are soft, luxurious, and keep her warm and toasty all night. The 190 gram weight will insure that they remain soft and smooth and not get thin and worn through washing as cheaper flannel will. Having only had them a month or so, don't know how they will hold up over many washings but after 4 or so, they are better than when new."
3,Not so sure,They look and feel lovely. I paid more for these sheets than I have paid for any others. I do not think they are going to hold up. There is a tare on the bottom sheet already. These are only a few weeks old. I will hand stitch the tare and we'll see what happens from there.
2,Can't Recommend,Save your money! These sheets are over-priced for what you get. They feel like a thin piece of felt. I'm genuinely surprised at how many positive reviews have been given for these. Sixty dollars for what are basically cheap Walmart sheets is too much.
3,it's ok,Feels like felt material and is warm and soft. I have noticed 2 things that annoy me. It becomes matted at times and I have 3 dogs and their hair is impossible to get off it without tape. Shaking it doesn't work. Going to buy smooth sheets like supima cotton next time. The best sheets are actually ones that have a blend of cotton/polyester and have been washed multiple times over the years which means they are used.
4,Excellent! but...,"So after reading on the raving reviews on these sheets I finally broke down and bought some. The bulk of the reviews were correct. These sheets are very thick, and soft. Fit my queen mattress well and they are in some aspects the best sheets I've ever owned. Retrospectively I wish I had not have gone for the Sage Green but a darker color. I have to lint roll these sheets every day because hair clings to them like crazy and my black hair on the sheets is very obvious and off putting. Also, in the evening when my room is lit only by artifical light, the green is so pale it looks gray and rather clashes with the dark brown tones in my comforter. If you do buy these sheets, the first time you dry them stop the dryer half way through and clean your lint trap or else they will never dry. Overall though great sheets."
5,Softest Sheets EVER!,"I live in a 100 year old COLD house. We have used flannel sheets every winter for years. Without a doubt, these are the softest, warmest sheets we have ever had. Sure, they will fill your dryer with lint, but what flannel sheet doesn't? I will buy another set, just to have when these wear out. They are that good!"
3,Disappointed,"With all the rave reviews for these sheets, I expected them to be heavierweight then they are. I guess I had been spoiled by 8 oz. flannel sheets. After doing the math (which I should have done before making the purchase), I now realize that 190 grams is more like 6 oz., so these sheets are definitely thinner than the super comfy ones I had enjoyed in the past. However, to buy a set of queen size 8 oz. flannels from the same catalog I purchased from originally would now cost me close to $150, so these sheets, for less than half that price, will have to do. Also, at least one reviewer mentioned that there was hardly any lint in the dryer lint screen after washing these sheets. I would have to disagree - I had quite a lint pile after their first wash. Moral of the story - you get what you pay for. I shouldn't have expected $150 quality in $60 sheets! My fault."
4,"Good Quality, but odd color","The sheets are actually pretty good quality--soft and pretty substantial weight for the price. We've been using them for two to three months and so far no pilling or notable thinning.The only disappointment was the color: we bought the ""Cream"" sheets, thinking they'd be a close color match for our ""natural"" ones. Not even close--the sheets we got were a bit darker...more like ""Latte."" Not a big problem unless you have other bed linens you're trying to match."
1,Ripped after 2 uses...,"Had these sheets for one month, washed in the washing machine twice using manufacturer's instructions. Bottom sheet has 2 small rips in them already. I missed my return window by one week. $60 down the trash. Will never buy sheets this expensive again. Save your money and buy a pair of less expensive sheets. They will probably last longer than a month...."
5,Best flannel sheets we've slept on!,"Love the length and depth. After several washings, they are still our favorite sheets! Works great for our i Comfort bed!"
5,So Warm,"My wife and I bought this sheet set for our bed along with a cotton velvet duvet & down comforter for the duvet. Its so snuggly warm under the sheets and they are incredibly soft. Likewise, its not so warm that you lose your mind. We keep our house between 70-72 in winter, and have a window open next to the bed because we smoke in the house. Getting underneath that duvet and the sheet makes it just warm enough, and if it ever gets to be too much just throw a leg out and you are fine. Best sheets I have ever owned in my opinion."
5,Soooo Soft and Fluffy!,"I bought the 190-gram cotton velvet flannel queen sheet set for my sister. She said they are wonderful! They are so soft and fluffy after washing and drying - and if folded right after drying are nice and smooth - no wrinkles. They are a nice weight and not thin or scratchy - again - sooooo soft and fluffy!! And the color seems to stay true even after washing. She especially liked the heavy duty elastic that is all around the bottom of the fitted sheet - fits well - stays on snug. This is the second set I have purchased for her - this time with extra sets of king sized pillow cases which she also loves. An awesome product for a very, very good price. No problems with giving this product 5 stars."
1,Nice soft sheets that smell like oil,"Nice soft flannel sheets that out of the plastic wrap smelled like oil. I washed them six times, left them outside on a line for three days in the wind and sun and still they smelled like oil. So i can't recommend unless you enjoy the smell of oil."
5,SO SOFT! SO WARM!,"These sheets are great - we received them for our wedding and they are amazing on a cold winter night. So soft and fuzzy - they're amazingly comfortable. They made a lot of lint in the dryer, so you may want to wash / dry seperate the first few times, but they are so thick and comfy."
5,LOVE,"I've spent a lot on sheets in the past, and these were so inexpensive I was suspect - but they are great."
4,Very comfy!,"These sheets are very soft and comfortable. The only reason they recieved four stars instead of five is the color. I ordered the ivory sheets and these are ivory but there appear to be patches on the sheets that are more yellow than others. The top and bottom sheet are slightly off from each other as well. The difference is small enough that I don't always notice it, only in certain lighting. The sheets are soft and warm enough that I would get them again."
2,"Great sheets, horrible color (Chamois)!!!","Ordered the Chamois color sheets for our new bed and bedroom set. Based on the pictures online I figured they were a tan/camel color which would go nicely with our Espresso finished furniture. When I got them however, they were pretty yellowish... almost mustard like. My first response was yuck, and I thought about returning them but our bed was coming the next day and there would be no way to get new sheets in time.Even though I hate the color, I must admit the sheets are comfy. My husband could care less that they clash with our bedroom so I'll probably just reorder the cream color and use this set as a back up.**Also, use caution when washing/drying the first time as they do shed a lot (I mean a LOT) of lint with the first run through. I had to empty my lint tray 3 times when drying to prevent it getting plugged up.**"
5,ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC FEEL!!!,"We have had flannel sheets for many years and have loved them, but they have been nothing as soft as these. We bought four sets of these ""Velvet"" flannel sheets to replace all of our old sheets. As someone else already said, five stars really aren't enough!At the price, they would make a REALLY appreciated wedding gift for someone.UPDATE AS OF 08/27/2009 - It's been 2-1/2 years since we bought these sheets and we still LOVE the feel! They have stayed VERY soft and inviting!"
2,Disappointment After the Wait,"Bought this sheet set in December and was wowed by the substantial feel of the sheets. They were soft and warm and wonderful and I wanted more. The new set came today, but the quality was not same. The new sheets are thin and smooth and don't have that ""feel."" What happened? The sheets were out of stock for 2 months, perhaps the manufacturer changed. Amazon, though, is amazing with their easy return policy."
3,Cozy but ripped.,"Sheets are thick and cozy. Upon first washing I noticed 3 tears in the flat sheet. Would have returned, but couldn't be bothered so just sewed it up.Expected a little better quality for the price."
2,"Great quality, but not deep enough to fit my bed","These sheets are great quality & very comfortable to sleep on! Unfortunately, they are not deep enough for my bed. For a 14 inch mattress (& topper included), these 16 inch sheets still do not remain in place & fitted sheet comes loose from underneath my mattress. I should've returned them for deeper pocketed sheets, but they have already been washed & used."
5,190-Gram Flannel Sheets,"This is a good quality flannel sheet set at a fair price. I've washed and used them several times and I'm very pleased with their performance. They are comfortable and have not pilled. Flannel is the only type sheet I use so I'm pretty picky. I would recommend this set to anyone who wants good flannel but doesn't want to spend alot.Updated 2/4/13I've purchased two additional sets of these sheets, Smokey blue and graphite. All sets are as comfortable as ever and they still have not pilled. I plan to buy one more set. Love the rich colors."
2,Sheds like crazy,"The velvet is extremely warm (perhaps a little bit too warm) and soft. However, within a few days, it started shedding like crazy. Now, my entire floor is filled with little pieces of the material and my clothes, hair, etc. are all covered when I get up in the morning. I kind of look like I just was under a snow machine. Hopefully a wash or two will take care of it, but I don't know."
4,Good Sheets for the price,"The sheets are great. They are soft, good quality and fit our queen size pillows and bed perfectly. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the color was not as the picture indicated. The sheets were a shade lighter. Other than that the sheets are awesome!"
4,Happy so far,"Well worth the price. Nice and soft,very warm. Not as much lint in the dryer as other sheets that I bought, but still more than I thought there should be for the price. Find that the colors are fading after only a few washings. More than happy with these, going to order another set."
4,Excellent bedwear,"These are soft, warm and very comfortable. I bought the king size to put on my waterbed. The bed has a heater which I turn on at night and crack a window with the room heat off. With a down comforter on top of the sheets and the waterbed hearter on it couldn't be better."
4,Oh so soft.....,"These sheets are the most comfortable, softest, flannel sheets I've ever slept on. The fit is good and they truly fit beds with deep pockets. The only downside is that when I roll over, the sheets tend to come with me and by the morning, they are coming off the corners. I was hoping with the deep pockets, they would stay put. Still searching for that solution short of the sheet garters which tend to come off as well."
4,"Soft, rich color","Really like these sheets initially - washed them before putting on our bed, and they remain smooth and soft. Have used now for more than a month, at least 4 washings and they are holding their color just fine. My only complaint is that they ""pill"" up quite a bit - small bits of fuzz develop where they are ""worn"" so we end up with lots of dark brown tufts that fall on the floor on the sides of the bed, and if I ever sleep in socks, my socks are also covered with the little tufts of fuzz and it's maddening to try to pick them off. Other than that, no complaints - they fit the bed well, and are so nice to go to bed to when the weather, and house, are cold."
5,Come home to comfort!,"WOW, WOW, WOW. After one years use, these quality flannel sheets are still my favorites. No more cold feet, no nasty little pilling spots, no stiffness, no anything less than perfect. Soft, warm, cozy and I am ordering another set today. Since I only had one set it was off and into the washer, dryer and back on the bed. Other set sheets need not apply. Go for these if you want the best."
3,Pretty Good,Its okay for wiping a baby's bottom. Don't use on the face because it caused my daughter to break out.
3,Could have been so much more,I enjoyed the flashbacks to earlier storylines. The ending was predictable and I would have enjoyed reading Spock's reaction to meeting Kirk again. Over-all feeling was that it was a wonderful idea (the crucible) but it floundered somewhere along the way.
2,Poor continuity research!,"Poor continuity research! Spock's mother's death was a major theme in the book by A.C.Crispin published in 1994, where she died of a wasting disease, so how come she dies here in a shuttle accident?Not the greatest read ....."
3,Second in the Crucible Trilogy,"I bought all 3 of the trilogy, read them in order back to back. I must say this second one was slightly disappointing. I feel I've known Spock for 40+ years, but I hardly recognised him here. One thing that bothered me was Spock's use of contractions. I don't think I''d seen that before anywhere. This book deals almost exclusively with his pursuit of ridding himself of emotion. Then there's an illogical ending kind of tacked on. Mr George is an excellent story teller as witnessed in the first book (McCoy). Where the first was a 5* plus this is only a 3*."
3,We need to consolidate the timlines people,"""Lost chapters"" are fine as long as they don't raise new questions like How could Amanda die of both a wasting illness as proposed in one book and a shuttle accident as proposed in this one? What is the point of having Spock undergo Kolimar training for a second time if we know that in another 5 years or so someone is going to make up an alternative explanation. It doesn't make any sense.I'm not saying that parts of the book aren't good they are there is some interesting interaction between Spock and McCoy epically and even the old Star Trek Animated series gets a nod but how can I or any other fan get excited about a book that seems half transcript of an episode I've already watched and half reimagined story line that someone is just going to change later? At least when your reading a Star Wars book you know that while certain developments are strange they will never change."
4,Product as expected,This doll is as expected. It's for my two month old niece so I'm hoping she grows into playing with it at the appropriate time. It's a soft doll with no parts on it that seem like they could come loose.
3,* touch and go *,"I had rather high hopes for this single, as it's apparently the precursor to Tipsy's brand new full-length album (the first in four years). What I discovered was a mishmash... doesn't immediately endear itself the way a listen to 'Trip Tease' does, nor does it give me the impression that it will leave a lasting appreciation. There's still that occasional glimmer of genius, though. Tipsy have demonstrated enormous talent with their dense layering of eclectic sounds (ie - 'TT'), but this single ranks among their lesser efforts (along with the Flying Monkey Fist 12""). A better investment would be the Asphodelic sampler, which has a great exclusive (?) Tipsy number - 'Bunny Kick' - as well as some remixes from TT and other amazing selections from Asphodel artists. The aforementioned 'Trip Tease' is also outstanding."
4,Pretty good book.,"I liked this book, most of it I already had knowledge of. But, I did really like the parts on astral projection."
2,"Eh, so so","Too flowery!! There wasn't much information. Actually there wasn't any information. It was just empty flowery words flowing from the front page to the back. It's written well, but there isn't any content to it."
1,There's meaning in there somewhere ...,"There's meaning in there somewhere only I can't find it for all the words. The thing is I really wanted to like this book but I can't seem to get past chapter two.The Author simply uses too many words to say the simplest things. And seems to hide everything behind several layers of imagery. It may be vivid imagery, and quite poetic, but the end result is confusion.A lovely first draft really but not a book that I could get anything out of."
2,Beautiful BUT,"Both salt shaker and pepper mill are large, colorful and very attractive BUT not functional. The size you ""see"" (and described) is deceptive as the amount of spice the containers hold is about a fifth of that! It's mostly solid wood ... great if you want to keep refilling the containers every week."
1,Glad I didn't buy this,"I got this from the library as an audio book and first off, the reader is absolutely HORRIBLE, one of the worst I've ever heard. Plus she sounds extremely old and the characters of the book are around 30, so that was weird to start with. I can't even describe her horrible reading style--just awful.I'm already bored to death with the whole thing. The background info on the characters is so long and dragged out and pathetic. I wish I had read the reviews before I even bothered checking it out from the library. I can't finish this awful mess and it takes alot for me NOT to finish an audio book.Who, at the publisher's reads these books? Could they possibly think this was good???? Or is it the usual case of an established author can produce any kind of drivel and they print it?"
1,3 weeks of being anoyed,"I chose 3 weeks in Paris because I like to read about modern women and I love Paris and I even enjoy a good romance novel now and again but this has got to be by far one of the worst books I have ever read! It started out alright in fact i really enjoyed it until the prologue ended. The book may have been passable had I been a ble to stand the main character Alexa but there was just something about her that made me want to ring her neck! It may have been the fact that everytime she said or thought something she sounded like someone who knew they were good at something but were trying to be modest in order to get attention. I have a strong feeling that Barbara Bradford is a very superficial woman and I dont think I will be reading another one of her books if I can help it. I would strongly recomend you stay away from this book or if you absolutly have to read it rent it from the library, dont waste your money!"
1,Just So Much Drivel!!,"Since I consider ""Woman of Substance"" to be a benchmark in women's fiction, I have read most of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books. ""Three Weeks in Paris"" was an utter disappointment and a waste of money. This 'essay' is such a sophomoric attempt that it is hard to believe she actually wrote it. It is filled with cliches, errors, repeated information and a very weak plot. The beginning showed some promise but before long it seemed the author got tired of writing and decided to wrap up quickly and go on to something more interesting.What a shame!"
2,Glad I checked this book out at the library!,"This story centers around 4 women who are were best friends in Sedgwick's School of Art. By invitation they return to Paris 7 years later. These women are so boring and you can't avoid not predicting the outcome of the story. The author spent an enormous amount f inki describing these characters and Paris; its streets, café and even the lamps that I began to think I was reading a tour guide instead of a novel. My suggestion is that you go to local library and check it out and form your own opinion, because its hard for me to believe that this book ever got published. Very disappointed."
1,expect to be bored,"... The characters are flat, the story unexciting, and the events very predictable. I decided not to give up on it because I believed it would get better. I was wrong. One thing, though, if you have trouble sleeping, this book will get you there faster than any pill the doctor could prescribe."
1,Boring,"""Once upon at time...................and they lived happily ever after."" B.T.B. has done so much better than this. I can't believe the author of ""A Woman of Substance"" could come up with such banality. The so-called fued was a joke, and the ending was so sweet it made my teeth hurt. I'm sorry I wasted my money."
4,A Quiet Paris,"I enjoyed the characters, going back to Paris and wondering just where Ms. Taylor was going with their lives. It was not however one of her best works. I did like the fact that she had her heroines come full circle at the end."
2,Rather boring,"This is a novel that I began b/c I adore books about Paris. Plus, I have read some other Bradford books and enjoyed them. This novel feels incomplete; characters are flat and the storylines are are wrapped up too neatly for my taste. In particular, the Alexa character gets on my nerves- too perfect to be true. Bradford presents us with scenarios that could be interesting (all the women have great careers) but are undeveloped. Only one plotline truly touched me and even that was rushed through. Paris isn't even that integral a part of the book! Thankfully, the book reads quickly. I recommend THe Last Time I saw Paris by Elizabeth Adler instead of this book if you are looking for something romantic, interesting and with more vivid Parisian scenes."
1,Terrible!,"This book was one of the worst I have read in a long time. Don't waste your money! It was extremely short and most of it was spent introducing the characters, none of which were interesting. The 'huge fight' that separated the 4 main characters was insignificant, none of them could even remember the exact details. These women were selfish and immature."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This isn't the worst book I've ever read but it's very close. The story is about four former friends who haven't spoken to each other in seven years but will be reunited when they celebrate their mentor's eighty-fifth birthday. What makes this book so bad is the fact that you don't care about any of the characters. All of their tribulations are all summarized so you don't experiance them with the girls.The feud that tore apart their ""strong"" bonds was juvenile and pathetic, worthy of only junior high students. One of the biggest beefs I had with the book is the fact that Alexa leaves America engaged to a fabulous guy and then hooks up with her old flame. Suddenly they're together and you never hear another word about Jack. In fact by the end of the book you're not sure she's even called him to break off the engagement.If you feel like you absolutely must read this monstrosity, borrow it from the library and don't waste your money."
2,NOT TOO GREAT,"Sorry I did not wait to buy this book used. Was not worth the full price I paid.....The main characters were very predictable and kind of boring....You know from the start where this story is going....Too much descriptions of the streets of Paris and houses....The story is about four women who return to Paris 7 years after graduating from Anya Sedgwick's School of Decorative Art....These women were best friends while attending school, but had a terrible fight and left after graduating. each persuing her own life and career without contacting each other all the years since..... They each received an invitation to attend their beloved teacher, Anya's 85th birthday party......They all attended and the rest of the story is spent rekindling old memories and revisiting all their old haunts.....etc. etc...If you want to read this book I suggest you borrow it from your library."
1,Same author?,"This author just can't be the same person who wrote ""A Woman of Substance."" It was such a tremendous book but they have gone down hill from there and has now ended up in the bottom of the barrel.This book spends much time developing the characters, but when you find out what the ""big quarrel"" was, you just want to say, ""Get over it"". This is a quarrel high school girls would consider major and these characters (30+) carried on for 7 years over that little incident? It was a disappointing and boring book. You would be wise to save your money. If you must read it, get it from the library -- but believe me, nothing happens in it. How do the author's get these types of books published? Because their names will sell anything - boo!"
4,"Remember the movie ""Beaches""?","This book reminds me a lot of that movie, which I loved. In this book about friendship and love we find four friends who have not communicated with each other in many years.Once upon a time, these friends were inseparable. They attended the same Art school and you never saw one without one of the others. That is, until one of them makes the others cannot forgive. Eventually none of the four are even speaking to each other until a surprise FED-EX envelope mysteriously appears, forcing them together again - to hate or to love. Each girl has a story of her own. Each girl believes without doubt she is right, and each has a story never told. But there just may be magic in the air in the form of an 85 year old lady named Anya. Watch for a surprise!"
1,Very bad!,"A Woman of Substance, which I thoroughly enjoyed, is the only other work I've read by Mrs. Bradford. So, when I checked out the audiobook of Three Weeks in Paris from the library, I was looking forward to good read (listen??). Even a reader as excellent as Barbara Rosenblat couldn't make this book better.The characters were all self-centered, soulless, shallow, and unsympathetic. I never want to encounter any of these people. I should have stopped listening, but it was like a train wreck--I was mesmorized by the horror!This is not a good book."
3,Didn't realize it was going to be a used library book.,Decent recipes but was quite surprised when I received this book and it was actually a used library book. I was pretty sure it was listed as new.
3,Not for vegetarians!,"The information in the first few chapters regarding all the different kinds of beans and how to cook them is very useful. I learned a lot I didn't know, even though I've been cooking lots of beans for years. However my biggest complaint is that, while not claiming to be a vegetarian cookbook, one might reasonably expect that something called ""The Bean Bible"" might be more vegetarian than not. But most of the recipes in this book call for meat of some kind, and many I would say are even more meat-based than bean-based. This is a real disappointment to me since I am a vegetarian. It's easy enough to replace the odd meat item in a recipe with a soy based meat item, but these recipes rely very heavily on meat and many do not lend themselves to substitutions. I would only recommend this book to hearty meat eaters."
2,Weak Book by Good Author,"Jane Langton's series of Homer Kelly mysteries is excellent; this book is weak. The characters are thin, the plot is disappointing, the atmosphere lacks her usual charm. Langton's a very enjoyable writer, but this book does not demonstrate it.If you've read and enjoyed the others, you'll probably want to read this to complete the series. If you haven't read any of her books yet, pick a different one."
2,A mystery based on an incredible coincidence disappoints,"Langton's picture of Nantucket is vaguely matching my own recent memories, although she succeeds in making it duller than it was for me. More than that, the story begins with a scene that is explained as an incredible coincidence pointing to our heroine as the murderer. I kept thinking, ""No, this is a device to mislead me"" but it was not the clever intricacy I'd been waiting for. It was just plain silliness. This is not just a small problem; this is the kind of mystery in which one must suspend commonsense. Some people can accept that fantasyland escapism. For them I've got a great bridge to Brooklyn cheap."
2,disappointing plotline undermines scenic thriller,"This mystery takes place on Nantucket Island, which I've visited. And the feel of the island is nicely drawn by Langton, if not with particular colorfulness. the incredible coincidence at the core of the mystery, however, undermines the novel. It demands a leap of ""faith"", that is, fantasy beyond any degree of realism, which I was not willing to take. In a nutshell: Langton, here, can't tell a story."
4,Valuable to buy,"This comprehensive and stunning volume introduces the world of wine through some beautiful photography and readable text. Novices and wine experts alike can learn this book to create an informative compendium of the production, character of wines. The illustrations of the vineyard and chateau producing the best wines in the world makes you want to travel there to taste the wine. The Book to be worthy recommened for you and collect it on you own bookshelf."
2,DIY was needed for my road bike,"Initially the attachments did not fit my road bike. You might need to go to DIY shop to find proper parts. I newly bought, Omega'' shape parts and spacers, nuts."
4,Credentials credentials credentials,Ann is someone who leared from the best. Jimmy Williams and George Morris. Ann always impresed me with her persistence and determination. She never waivered from her goal. I haven't read the book yet but can personally vouch for the author.
5,Great Resource,"I bought this book many years ago as a beginner/intermediate rider, and still refer back to it as an advanced rider. Why? This book is excellent at instilling the elements of riding; it provides the tools for maintaining a good foundation in basic skills and how to apply them to more complicated tasks/situations. There is a logical progression of exercises, encouraging the rider to be conscious of their skill level, as well as that of the horse, and identify exercises that will advance both as a team. It is well organized/photographed and easy to reference; it can supplement lessons from a competent trainer and may provide clarity after a lesson where you 'just did not get what they were saying,' or be an inspiration/tool kit on practice ride days when you want to develop a skill/remedy a trouble area. The author encourages to ride with a purpose while maintaining a positive, respectful relationship with the horse."
2,I Prefer George Morris,"I bought this book at the same time as ""Hunter Seat Equitation"" by George Morris. I much prefered Morris' style of presenting information and have been able to incorporate pieces of it much faster. Kursinski's approach to this book, essentially telling the reader to tell his or her instructor what to do, did not work well with me. Try telling a ""lead mare"" what to do in her own barn! From personal experience telling your trainer that a book determined your training program is not a bright thing to do. Maybe a self-taught rider would have more luck with this book than a person in riding lessons."
5,Great book!,"This is a really good book, and it has helped me a lot. I recomend it to all people who would like to improve their flatwork, jumping, and overall performance, and to anyone starting to jump. It's a good book from begginer through advanced."
4,I'm Still Shaking!,Great cd. I listened to it again and again and always found something I hadn't attended to before!The first song is the best!!
2,Cobra LI 7000-2 WX VP,I have had these 2 way radios for less than a year and I am already having poor reception and batteries will not fully charge.
2,Not as good as it says,The range is not all that. The 2-3 second delay is terrible. And how do I put it on a maximum range? I have tried what the manual says and doesn't work.
3,I think was better,"Really i think, this is the best radio, best range, and best battery duration, but no. Its a normal walkie tolkie but whit more channels. not is a fantastic radio its a normal radio."
4,Very Good for non-professional radios,"Being an Amateur Radio Operator I am very tough to please with radios like this. I am used to radios made for emergency communication that are the same quality as police and fire radios. In addition I have walkie talkies that go through repeaters that can communicate for hundreds of miles. HF radios communicate around the world.I purchased these for a cruise. The UHF frequencies go through metal better than lower VHF. Having the extra power helps to. Even though they will have a reduced range on things like a ship, they really do pretty well. Having the security codes prevent interference from other people who may be using the same frequency. Overall worth the money.This radio also has a 1350mah battery that lasts much longer than so many other cheap walkie talkies. This is probably the best one made."
4,Dart World 19903 Piranha Darts,Purchased as a gift. Major disadvantage is that it does not have a moveable point. Flights move which is great if another dart hits it.
4,Beginning Dart Player,These are very nice darts compared to standard darts. I think the only draw back I don't like is the fact that the tail spins. I have since thrown with other darts that don't and that is one feature that I would change. Otherwise you get what you pay for.
4,"Not exactly as described, but I like....","So the grip I got is not as advertised... but I like the darts anyway. They are better than what I was using from the local Academy prior to this purchase, and since I knew I'd be dealing with return shipping and delays, I decided to try them out anyway and I liked them enough to keep them. The box and all indications showed that it matched the product in the photo, but the grip on my darts has no knurl- it's smooth metal aside from the 4 grip rings etched parallel to the dart shaft. The heavier weight works for me since I tend to hurl the darts at the board, and I use a pencil-grip, so they ended up being pretty good for my purposes. I like the spin-free flight shafts too. All in all, I am happy with what I got and the performance of these darts. Nice hard case that holds extra flights as well. Wish the set came with back-up shafts, but happy for what I got and the price paid. :-)"
5,Perfect,These darts are perfect!I feel so much more confident on dart night..These darts fly so straight..I was amazed with the consistency I gained once I switched to Pirana darts..They give me an advantage.The case is really impressive to.You will want to show this set of darts off to other darters. Thank YouRamendra James
5,"""Ruby""s are a gem","I just got the Ruby in sand. The lining is velvety, the sole is padded and springy, and the color is exactly what I was looking for - something neutral to go with a lot of different outfits. The photo looks a little washed out, but the material is a rich leather. What is not visible in the photo on Amazon, though, is that the strap (not the one across the toes) has six little leather braids across it; this is a unique detail that adds character. Maybe an additional photo should be added."
3,Not Bad for a B Movie,"This movie was worth watching; it's funny and entertaining. The plot changes half way through and never comes back to complete the story. But that's what you'd expect from a B movie. Heck, I've seen A list movie worse than this one."
2,Not Much Here Besides Excess,"I'll be honest, I sat through the hour and a half mess that was RoboGeisha and I'm still not 100% sure what the movie was about. There's a lot of blood and violence but there's not a lot of sense to it all.I like movies that try really hard to be serious and fail miserably. Plan 9 From Outer Space and The Room come to mind as movies that worked because they were disastrous. RoboGeisha on the other hand doesn't even look like it tried to be serious. It was a joke from the start, plain and simple.RoboGeisha will have its appeal to some. Some people enjoy the over the top action and lack of apparent plot. Crank and Shoot Em Up come to mind. But RoboGeisha lacks the fun that I found in either of those movies. Unless you're really into Japanese B movies, there's not much appeal to this movie."
2,"This would have made a great, funny short.","The first 30 minutes of this movie are quite entertaining. Think a female 3 Stooges meets Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and 70's video games. But the ole' Butt Blade gets old, and while lines like Pig Geisha B****es Die! have a certain amusement factor, the film gets repetitive with its cheap effects and cheaper dialogue and before you know it, the fun and humor have worn off faster than you can realize that no one in the film can shoot, no matter what orifice the bullets fly from. There are some really original touches -- the breast-powered machine guns are a hoot, as is some of the fighting -- but a lot is downright silly or a snooze and there's no real character development. A good idea that could have worked well as a short film, but too much of a good thing gets boring and the plot is too convoluted for the level of hilarity that doesn't quite ensue."
1,Another bad moive,"Not much can be said about this movie. It has an awful script, bad acting. Bad all around."
1,"This is total rubbish, bad script, poor acting, senseless plot","At first I thought it might actually be worth watching because it was released by the same folks that produce the animes. However, Robo Geisha's plot and characters don't make any sense, and it isn't even in a silly way. It is as if a 3 year old wrote out a wild story on index cards, threw them in the air, and a director just randomly picked them together. I highly recommend you avoid this movie."
1,Completely Dreadful!,"This is the worst movie I have ever watched. As a matter of fact, I didn't even watch it in play. I watched it at 2x speed to save 45mins of my life. Even still, 45 mins of my life was utterly wasted.If you want to see geisha robots kill opponents with: ninja stars that shoot out of their (covered) breasts, swords that are attached to their butts, a skillsaw that forms out of their mouth, slicing a man in half with their hand, and numerous other completely non-sexualized, not even humorous fashion . . . then rent this movie (don't even buy it as it may still disappoint).I want 45 mins of my life back . . . can Amazon refund me that?Dreadful!!P.S. Nothing erotic in the entire movie. One kiss in the movie, that's it. WASTE."
3,decent B movie,this movie was okay and kept my attention throughout. The premise was entertaiing and the actors did a decent job. Only gets 3 stars
4,Robocop Just Got Pimp-Slapped!!,"Length:: 9:56 MinsJust kidding.In this video we discuss:The importance of machine gun nipples,spring loaded butt-sword safety,anal-projectile calibration,as well as demonstrate proper care for circular saw dentures.Seriously though....RoboGeisha is this months madcap entry into the hyperviolence sub-genrefrom Noboru Iguchi & Yoshihiro Nishimura; the lunatics behind Machine Girl & Tokyo Gore Police.It's may not be as gory as the formerbut it's zanier than the latter.ALSO RECOMMENDED:Machine Girl, Tokyo Gore Police, Vampire Girl vs. Frankenstein Girl, Mutant Girls Squad,Hell Driver, Hard Revenge Milly, Meatball Machine, & Samurai Princess"
2,Definately not my style...,"I did have a very hard time to watch this movie. I usually expect either a good story, or senseless fun from Japanese movies/animation. But this did not have a good story, neither a lot of sense, and of course no fun.There are very good FUNimation imports here, this is just not one of them. I can't even compare this to anything. If you look at the cover, and like what you see, you might probably enjoy it. However, if - like me - you do cannot make any sense, I assure you your experience would be worse than what you expect."
1,"Silly Movie, Good Japanese Practice","Actually I think this movie has a plot but it's too silly to give it any attention. My interest was in using this movie to practice understanding Japanese and in that regard it's actually ok. Because some lines are repeated this makes listening to the same thing twice easy without having to rewind.Visually the quality appears to be fairly decent (some rather simple sets).If you're looking for entertainment, this certainly fits in the category of ""mindless""."
2,Acid Breast Milk,Yes. The subject is correct. There is acid for breast milk in this film. This Japanese movie is one of the craziest things I've ever watched. It is about a band of female assassins that recruit geisha. They are on a mission to clean up Japan. There are robots and crazy fight scenes. This film is so surreal that you will enjoy it for the strangeness - but I'm not sure you will care for much else. There are sub-titles.
2,pointless but amusing,"I love Asian cinema, withOnibaba - Criterion Collectionremaining an all-time favorite. However, any and all thoughts of art can be dismissed from consideration when it comes to ""Robogeisha"". I concede that a film like this one isn't meant for anyone who doesn't normally go for, well, whatever this thing is. But it's so completely devoid of anything that makes a good film it's stomach-churning. It's possible to enjoy a crappy movie, if it's not intentionally awful, but when the filmmakers set out to make a dreadful film it's just pointless. The back cover of this dvd proclaims, seemingly proudly, that ""Robogeisha is an orgy of WTF"" - despite all this, it seemed more amusing the second time around."
4,"Not my cup of tea, but my friend helped review","I was curious about this Japanese action genre of this kind, and was really taken aback by the movie, I did not expect it to be what it was! But I got my friend who is into these things to watch it, and he liked it. He said not a bad addition to the crazy Japanese movies like this, including the machine girl, he has. So it's a matter of taste, and for folks who enjoy this genre, it is indeed a fun and enjoyable movie to watch. I could also kind of agree with the ""art"" of the movie and direction. Something in me also enjoyed it, who doesn't like pretty girls shooting and cutting up people!"
4,Fantastically awful movie,"If you're not in the mood for a movie where a cybernetic geisha transforms into a tank powered by her strumming on a string instrument as she tracks down a pagoda golem and dodges grenades thrown by bikini-clad goblin girls on the creature's face, then this is not the movie for you.If that description of one scene, only one of the many hilariously over-the-top scenes in this movie, catches your interest, watch this movie. Preferably with friends and a steady supply of snacks and drinks and a broad sense of humour."
3,Purple Sticky Stuff and a Movie,"Okay, I a big fan of ICP and the likes, but what a trip. What kind of demented nutcase thinks this kind of bizarro stuff up?I always thought that Godzilla movies were cheesy, but now I have a different take on a seriously deranged culture.Although this is not my cup o tea, I do realize there are more folks, worse off than myself, who can truly appreciate this imaginary chaos.If you like a gaffe of nothing but bizarro gore special effects and no real story plot... you'll more than likely need a bag of purple sticky stuff to enjoy this movie."
3,"Not bad, but lacking in terms of the real goods that you'd watch this kind of thing for","Let it be said right now that if such things as bleeding buildings, acid-burning breast milk, and robot buildings are not your thing in the least, turn back now. RoboGeisha lives up to its tagline as being ""an orgy of WTF"" by throwing one goofy visual gag at you after another, with little to no remorse for that matter. If you've seen such works as The Machine Girl or Tokyo Gore Police, then you know what you're getting here with RoboGeisha. That being said though, RoboGeisha doesn't come close to being the kind of splatterfest that either of those two films wound up being, but it is much more lighthearted as well, and easier to swallow for those who typically don't check out flicks like this. Still, RoboGeisha is worth a look for those with a warped enough sense of humor and a taste for the freaky."
5,A Tribute to the Richner Family,"The Richners should be commended for keeping this 120+year old newspaper alive. As virtually nobody in Rockaway is capable of reading anymore, its publication has got to be a labor of love. The granddaddy of the Nassau Herald, the Rockaway Journal is one of the State's oldest newspapers. If you live in Far Rockaway or ever did live there, you should be receiving the Rockaway Journal. And say thank you to Stu and Cliff for their weekly Rockaway Journal."
2,Really disappointing film,"I am a huge Vanness Wu fan. I watch everything he does no matter how bad because I see him as a star with a ton of potential. However, I cannot make any allowances for this steamer. Everything is horrible from the poor script, bad acting, poorly choreographed fight scenes and the terrible dubbing of the voice overs. The only strong point and the only thing that allowed me to watch the entire thing was the fact that Vanness is the hottest guy on the planet. So, unless you just want to watch V-Dub with the sound down I really do not recommend this movie at all."
3,"Descent movie, misleading dvd cover","The movie is ok, specialy for the price. I bought the dvd at K-mart for $1.99.The dvd cover is really misleading. First off, it's not the Kumite that we know, it's more like a torniment like in the movie ""the Karate Kid"", second, the guy on the dvd cover is the bad guy,(the guy the star fight at the end) The story is ok, a long love story in the middle of the action. The one thing that botherd me is that at the end of the movie you don't know who wins. Over all, an ok movie. For the price. $1 to $3 is a good price to pay."
3,Vanness Wu!,"This movie is about a boxer and his relationship with a teacher. (Younger man, older woman relationship / student, teacher relationship) If you like Vanness Wu (in F4), then you'll enjoy watching this movie simply because he is in it. Otherwise, if you're looking for a story line.. character development.. boxing or marital arts moves.. realistic plot.. then maybe not."
1,false advertisement,"false advertisement picture shows 100 dics but received only 1 dics worth .50 cents , come on."
4,Opera in English,"This is the one. You'll never know more than two words of Hungarian, say, ""hello"" and ""thank-you,"" and neither is in the libretto for this opera."
3,Not worth the price.,Once again the price is great but the price paid for it and the shipping charges is outrageous. I will never order from this company again.
5,real trinidad hot sauce,This is real Trinidad hot pepper sauce! Beware if you are not a fan of hot but if you enjoy habanero sauce this is a great one.
5,My favorite!,This hot sauce has both great heat and flavor. Even though the flavors are unique it happily goes on anything that you would normally put hot sauce on. People unprepared for the heat may find it a little intense but for any one that enjoys heat this is a good one to add to the fridge.
2,Description discrepancy--clarification please.,"The description says that there are 60 rods in the package. However, the specifications indicate that there are 6 rods of each color. There are only 7 colors shown in the picture. Which means 56 rods. What's with the discrepancy? I don't like that at all."
2,Pack of crap!!!,The purple ans the gray did not bend at all! Period! Luckily I had some purples that I purchased from a beauty supply store when I was on leave in the states. The orange ones are ok at bending then the rest of the little one are pretty good too. But I normally dont want little curls. I like the big ones! I was so upset. I knew I should have just order the Annies...
3,Hit and miss,This would have been perfect if the purple and grey ones bended.. Other than that they worked just fine. For the price I can't really complain and i also don't have long enough hair to use the bigger ones but. I would still recommend this.
3,Worth buying,"All of then work great, except the purple an grey ones, but the others work great, theres enough of them for my whole head to make small to medium size curls. A lot better then using heat or sleeping with huge rollers."
5,He's Back!,"Andre Nickatina's back and he's as good as ever. This new CD is a masterpiece, for a true Nickatina fan. There are several great songs, such as These R The Tales and when Andre teams up with San Quinn, in Saw A Gangsta Cry. I would request this album to only true Nickatina fans."
3,decent...,"Just because its Nickatina, you cant rate this too harshly.I can listen to about 2 or 3 tracks on this CD over and over.. which is worth it to me."
2,Very Disappointing,"I really like Andre Nickatina, but this was dissappointing. The production seemed lackluster and his flows were just not as good as the patented King Nicky that we all have grown to love. Oh yeah I didn't even notice any ninjas."
3,customer service is bad!,"Bought the ""Roaring Rapids"" slide for my daughters birthday party, within a few days a seam split without undo pressure. OK things happen, but the manual with the slide says"" call manufacturer not retailer"". Called TOYQUEST. Horrible customer service! If you can get someone to answer, they are indifferent and tell you to send them this and that and then you hear nothing back. I called again today, amd now the story is "" we don't normally ship single slides so it will be a few more days."" Then called Amazon and they said I should have called them first despite the instructions and they will ""see what they can do."" The slide was great while it lasted, but the aftermath after the problem is just what you would expect nowadays. Won't buy through Amazon again."
2,They need to make this product more durable.,We were able to use this product maybe 4 times last season. We pulled it out this year for the first time and a complete seam went out on the curved small slide. For the cost of this we should have got much more use. We took very good care of our slide and supervised to make sure it was used correctly. When called company said we needed and extended warranty. Have not found out that you could have purchased an extended warranty.
2,Happy for one day!,"We purchased this slide with the impression that the quality was going to be very durable. However, after the first use we had gotten a rip in the seam. We tried to use the provided patches and glue. however, they will not hold. In addition trying to get in touch with toyquest.com takes more than a week. Then of course they tell you that you can send it back to amazon. Which amazon tells you the item must come back in same packaging. Unfornately our kids played with the box and there is no way we can mail our slide back in original packaging. I will not buy from amazon or toyquest again."
4,Great slide for Summer fun,"We purchased the slide at the end of June (2008) and we have used it at least once a week since. The first couple of weeks it was almost every day.Only issue I have is that I only weight 160 and the climbing wall won't support my weight like it stated it could, but that's OK. We bought it for the kids. If I was able to slide down with them that would have been a bonus."
4,Slide,Relatively easy to set up on flat area. Grandkids had a blast! Kept them busy for hours. Came down easily for putting away.
5,Fantastic,"I purchase this water slide for my daughter 7th birthday party, and it was a hit with all the kids. Adults and kids had fun it is very durable for both adults and children. The water slide was the hit of the party everyone keep talking about it even when the party was over telling us this was the best party they ever attended. MONEY WELL SPENT!!"
3,Worth reading,"I have mixed feelings about this book. Four stars would be a rather generous evaluation, three stars is probably too severe. There are hundreds of drawings showing the forms of the different styles. This part is excellent and it will serve you very well in remembering the sequences. Obviously, it is impossible to learn the forms only from drawings: no book could possibly do it.The rest is not very convinving to me. I have the impression that the author, in his quest to deliver knowledge, gave too many personal interpretations. The borderline between facts and legends is often blurred. I am not capable of assessing whether the philosophy of Tao is explained properly, nonetheless it's interesting. Would I buy this book in back perspective? Probably I would, however this book didn't click my switches. Yet."
4,Get the hardcover edition!,"The original hardcover version (The Tao of Tai-Chi Chuan) is a classic of sorts, with numerous line drawings of different taiji forms, silk-reeling exercises, and Taoist diagrams galore. The paperback edition (The Dao of Taijiquan) is updated with Pinyin transliteration, but unfortunately all of the drawings have been very poorly scanned; the whole book looks as if it was done with an Etch-a-Sketch."
4,Great fit but not sure of quality yet.,Easy to install but nowhere near the quality of the all metal OEM valve and thus the 4 stars. Turned out nothing was wrong with my old one so I just cleaned up my old valve and keeping it as a spare just in case.
1,Factory rejects,"Shoe was poorly constructed. The material that was cut for the bridge of the shoes was not calculated correctly. The length of the shoe will fit your shoe size. However, the shoe will fit extremely tight around the top of your foot. I have never bought a pair of shoes like this before. I'll never buy Daniel Green shoes again. Do not waste your money on these made in China shoes. Buy some Isotoners instead."
1,DANIEL GREEN slippers,"I like the style, but they are don't fit properly. In fact, I will return them soon in the original condition.Joan"
1,TOO SMALL,"I love DG slippers, but these are defective. I'm sending them back. If these are size 8M, well, they just can't be. They are size Barbie!"
1,Disappointed,"This slipper looks great, but within 3 months there are holes in the insole. I have pedicures every 3 weeks which alleviates poorly maintained feet as the cause. The material used in the insole, now the exposed material, make my feet sweat and burn. I have owned Daniel Green slippers previously, twice. Sadly, this pair has been a waste of my money."
3,Pretty,"En mi experiencia cada estilo de pantuflas Daniel Green vienen diferentes las tallas, esta, no es que corra chica lo que pasa es que esta demasiado angosta, leí lo que opinaba la gente y yo soy 7 1/2 M. Y ordene 8 wide y me aprieta, debí de haber pedido 71/2 WW y estaría muy bien por lo demás me acaba de llegar por ahí leí que se le descosió a una, no me ha pasado con esta marca, si no todo lo contrario; si salen de poca calidad lo agregare mas adelante, están muy bonitas."
4,"Nice, but runs small and narrow, W stands for M","Very nice product, feels great, comfortable, but certainly runs small and narrow. So, if you are 6 or 6.5 M, for sure get 7 W, or else it will be too small and narrow. Quality wise, five stars, but sizing is not true to size. I got two pairs, one for my Mom that usually wears size 10 W. I got her 10.5 in W because that was the widest one, and it is way too narrow for her. Length wise just barely there, but width did not work for her at all. So, I returned her pair."
1,Never got the item,I think I would have liked this item had it ever gotten to my house. I placed an order for three things all on the same day through amazon.com and two of the items came a week later. This item however was ordered on Nov. 30 as a Christmas Present for my mother and I got notification on December 23rd that it was returned undeliverable. How the other two items in the same order made it to me fine and this one got sent back is beyond me but I was upset because it took so long to get any information that I wasnt even able to try and get my mom something else for Christmas. So Amazon thanks for nothing.
3,Review of Daniel Green slipper,This slipper is not as comfortable as I hoped it would be. That is why I gave it only 3 stars.
3,FAIRLY COMFORTABLE,"Better than some of the cheaper mules, but these are definitely not leather as described.Price was cheaper than the other Daniel Green slippers."
3,Slippers,"I order this slipper in size 8Wide, but they are too nero. They look nice. I will try to make them bigger or give a gift to somebody. Not so happy."
3,I like the slippers,"If the shoes were leather as advertised, I would give a higher rating.They do run small and narrow, but I did order the correct size."
2,Daniel Green Slipper was a disapointment,"I had heard so much about them from others but when they arrived, they were not well made. The heels felt like they were not glued together so they creaked when I walked on them."
2,Not leather,"I bought this because I need a pair of indoor slipper with heels, since I have a back problem. For that, it serves its purpose. However, I am not happy with the description on Amazon. It claims that this slipper is made with leather. But when I got the product, it clearly states all man made material in its label.I am giving it a two star since for a pair of all man made material slipper, $37 is quite expensive. And it does run small. I ordered half size bigger than my shoe size. It sill fits a little tight.Jing"
2,Slippers,"Daniel Green slippers are very comfortable if you order the right size , they tend to run very small and because of this they are tight around the instep. I only wish they had 1/2 sizes, I only ordered these because of the price(usually they are much more) Again I only wish they would fit."
4,What a hoot!,Fun record by the 13th Floor Elevators band-mates...some nice crunching guitar. each song is followed by a humorous piano based anecdote. Worth picking up if a fan of the IA (International Artists) sound
2,The Chicago Outfit,"This is an exceptionally poor book. Fact are wrong (Green Mile for Green Mill nite club), locations are wrong (Chicago Theater does not have a back door on Walbash) Seem to be a clip and paste effort done mostly from old newspaper clippings. How anyone could write about the prohibition era and not mention Canadian Ace, or the DeLisa brothers, or Botchie Conners or Jimmy Sterch or Nattie Trigger or ... the list could go on as long as the book. At least Asbury's book on Chicago crime spoke of such ancient history that even though you knew it was a hack job it was amusing. This is too bad as no one to my knowledge has done any real interviewing of the survivors of the real outfit. Serragusa could have supplied a wealth of information, if he had been cultivated. All in all, just a little better than the cheap sensationalism of Jack Lait."
4,great overview,This book is a great overview pictoral of the Chicago Outfit with a focus on the early years. For me it was a goldmine as I was doing a genealogy search as well.
5,"Uplifting, inspired, a guiding light - I can't say enough!","This ""must have"" book is a guide post to spiritual living. It ignores dogma and religionists while championing the living faith of Jesus. Those who find no home in organized religion will find comfort and a friend in these pages. Compelling, encouraging, thoughtful; yet easy to read and understand. Offers great hope for these troubled times."
4,Does exactly what it says,This changer is a premium accessory for the connection of two male VGA cables to create an extended cable.
3,"Yngwie Faces The Animals Of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Yngwie had been putting out alot of albums that were just hitting par and this live set is no exception. Recorded live during his FACING THE ANIMAL TOUR and released in August of 1998, YNGWIE MALMSTEEN: LIVE!! is much better than Yngwie's other live disc TRIAL BY FIRE: LIVE IN LENINGRAD, but it sounds like everyone is just going through the motions. Highlights include ""Seventh Sign"", ""Rising Force"", and ""My Resurrection"" with disc 2 of the 2 CD set being extremely forgettable except for the now classic ""I'll See The Light Tonight"". Nothing really new here, just Yngwie ripping it up live with the results sounding less than inspired. The companion VHS/DVD of this show is much more enjoyable if only to see Yngwie playing on stage which is truly a treat."
2,Fondant rings,I had hoped to use them for more than fondant; ie some very thin doughs but they are too fine for this purpose. They need to make a ring another size thicker.
1,DO NOT BUY ... SAVE YOUR MONEY,"In theory ... the rings sound great. In reality ... a waste of good hard earned money. They did not make a bit of difference in rolling out my fondant. As a matter of fact ... I purchased the 20' solid plastic roller to attach the rings ... and that was a bust. I put the new roller and plastic rings aside and used my old fashion rolling pin and came out 100% better than with the ""helpful"" tools. SAVE YOUR MONEY folks. If you have an old fashion rolling pin ... USE IT!"
3,Mostly Good,"These are just normal tolling pin guide rings that fit the Wilton 20in rolling pin. I thought they would help out alot with getting my fondant rolled out evenly. That is only partly true though. You must get these rings on just perfectly for that to happen. I now do not use them anymore because they are more hassle than they are worth. I just eyeball the thickness and I do just as good of a job as the guide rings. Overall, these are exactly what they should be. I just wouldn't buy them again. I feel like it was a waste."
2,Limited usefulness,"Nothing in the description indicates what size rolling pin these rings will fit. I couldn't even get them past the handles on mine, so they proved useless."
2,"Looks good, sounds flat","This trumpet is all about the looks, the keys don't fit properly and the sound is flat. Over priced for a toy, not good enough for a first band trumpet"
3,Another Tech Book Killed by Frills and Filler,"There can be no doubt that the pages of this book contain some of the most original and decisive ideas about dashboard design of any book to come out on the market. Yet this strength cannot quite redeem it. This book is mostly pictures, figures, and graphs, many of which are not needed. The same could be said of dashboards in general. The prose is watered down and childlike, as if the author would spoon feed his ideas, one per chapter, to an infant audience. In the end I am forced to conclude that, like many tech books in HCI, a hard core text filled with complex ideas, lean, well-written chapters, and something like wit is both outside the reach of its authors and outside the bounds of contemporary techie marketing. This book may sell, but it does nothing to promote a sophisticated, confident HCI core at a time when awareness of the profession is still patchy. It will be a great day for HCI when its ""Gurus"" stop condescending to their audience."
3,Kind of a Drag..,"First of all, this is a great book. You read through its pages and find yourself saying ""ahhh, that makes sense"". But the problem is that the author spends the majority of his time criticizing other dashboards without offering as much examples of what an ideal dashboard should look like.There are two dashboards that he offers as exemplary dashboards, but I don't think that's enough. Furthermore, too much of what is saying is either commonsensical or simply too theoretical for a person to retain - only if this book was supplemented with a set of exercises..."
4,Informative and amusing,"At last .. a documenting tech-head with a sense of humour. I found this book enlightening, amusing (ok tongue-in-cheek style) and useful. What more could you want in a manual? The book is a little more glossy than it needs to be, and if they cut down on the white-space it would fit into my handbag. However, the content is excellent. It's easy to read, easy to follow, and gives you everything you need to know about developing the most effective and efficient dashboards. I recommend this to everyone who has to design and/or develop performance solutions for their business community."
1,too basic,Working in BI i thought this would help with visualising and better techniques to build dashboards but the book didnt give best practices or information on what gives the end user more value. it instead gives you choices on what is available for dashboards but that is more common sense. don't waste your money.
5,"A great book, a great sale","I bought this book from this source, and it came in very good condition and no hiccups in the process."
2,Disappointing,I had high hopes when picking up this book. In the end I found little of use. Perhaps I was looking for more than an approach that was business oriented. Information displays for systems monitoring are a topic almost completely missed in the book.
1,terrible packing - good content,"About the packing:the item came damaged... pages bended and ripped. the buble plastic bag packing didn't provide enough protection the book needed.About the content:The content of the book is ok, very clear and the brochure has a good paper material. The author is very objective and conducts the reader to a quick understanding of dashboards principles and best practices."
1,Lack of depth and necessary detail,"This book seems fit for people concerned about layout more than how you actually build a dashboard. The fact that most dashboard projects are 80% data warehouse/OLAP work and 20% design work has been ignored by the author. There is also a sense of arrogance in the writing, where the author gives most attention to his own unique dashboard layout ideas which are partially irrelevant to the commercially available dashboard tools that most organizations are buying today. In summary, this book may be helpful if you need help deciding what colors to put on your charts, but it is completely missing most of the activities that are key to the success of a dashboard project."
4,"Good, Practical Contribution to Visually Communicating Data","This book offers more than the title might suggest...more specifically, this title provides a good foundation for how to communicate data visually in general. Stephen Few does a good job demonstrating examples of good and ""not so good"" visual presentations of data utilizing Information Dashboards.I found the example Information Dashboards at the end of the book to be particularly useful. This book could serve as a good reference for those interested in effectively communicating data visually."
4,A high-water mark in the category,"I don't use or create dashboards, but I've been looking for clear guidance in the area of graphs and charts. The Wall Street Journal and the Economist seems to have mastered the job of cranking them out. Instead of aping the ones in the paper, I needed some background training to appreciate what I'm seeing. I tried Tufte's beautiful work, but found it too abstract for a first-timer.Stephen Few is evidently a man of taste and wisdom. This volume speaks eloquently and in the just the right amount about common pitfalls and the path that avoids them. He performs a tremendous and valuable service assimilating work by other greats in this field and adding useful innovations of his own.If you appreciate great design, and work with numbers, especially Excel, this will make you a hero. Rarely do you acquire expensive new skills as easily as you will by reading this book."
1,Yawn yawn yawn..................,"The best of Malmsteen? This guy cannot write a decent piece of music at all. The songs have and always will be terrible. This is the difference between YJM and Eddie VH, VH write songs that appeal to more than just mainstream neo-classical retards. You could rename this the 'worst of' and it wouldn't make any difference. The Swedes like this kind of thing cause they don't understand the songs. Mind you that goes for everybody else out there that can hear."
2,Doesn't work well!,I bought this to encourage more tummy time but my 4 month old doesn't care much for it. It doesn't stand up well and the handle to start the mouse moving is very hard to pull for a baby.
4,WWII Willys Jeep replica,"I am using this model to create a replica of the Jeep my father drove in Europe with the 4th Infantry Division from D-Day to the end of the war in Europe. It is pretty detailed for a 1/35th scale. I have not completed it as of yet. So far, the pieces fit well and I am very satisfied with it."
3,Hardcore subject--but too flattering and soft with facts,"Overall I was dissapointed to not learn more about the great love of Eric's life, Arcadia Lake. This talented raven-haired beauty supposedly died of a drug overdose in 1990, but their are no published obituaries or places of burial listed anyplace. Eric is not too kind to this great love of his, blaming her for his own addiction to cocaine. It's only his story we read every place. Where is her story? Who knows, like Bambi Woods or Hypathia Lee, she might still be alive today! Alexander's book seems to be contracted for approval by Mr. Edwards since all the sympathy lies in his burnt-out corner. A lot of the book covers a day in the life of shooting porn--or a week--oh heck, without Arcadia he's all washed up now, anyway. The AIDS scare is also covered as well as interviews from some of porn's most well-known stars and supporters."
2,Save your money,"I heard a great song being played at Tower while I was shopping for some Christmas presents (picked up a wonderful Afrobeat remix album and Bebel Gilberto), and immediately asked what it was. ""Si*Se"". So I picked it up and a few friends and I sat down to listen a couple of nights later. The comments ranged from bland to derivative - nobody was very impressed. Though that one song was a good one, I was disappointed in the album overall."
2,cheap made!,"My son found this costume online and had to have it. The costume is horribly made! It doesnt fit right, the mask is really small and was so smashed in the package I can't get it back in shape to fit his face! I am very unhappy with the quality for as much money as I paid for it! Never again!"
5,Pure Delight for lovers of both Mozart and music for organ!,"Seventeen short epistle sonatas (played between the reading of the Epistle and the Gospel during Mass) for chamber orchestra and organ. Here we have young Salzburg Mozart, full of joyous music. These pieces are so much fun, it is hard to believe they were ever allowed in church. They must have caused dancing in the aisles!Genevieve Soly plays the organ with such subtlety and finesse on this CD. How lovely to hear an organ used as an enriching member of an ensemble rather than as an overpowering solo instrument. And what a superb ensemble Soly has to work with in the I Musici de Montreal.Buy this terrific addition to your collection of Mozart! You won't be sorry."
5,Pediatrics,"The book Pediatrics by Osborn, DeWitt and Zenel is a unique textbook. Its novel cover compels the viewer to open it. I have been a pediatrician for 47 years and there has not been a textbook so well formulated. The various colors identify the topics and make it useful for anyone. When appropriate, the authors include recommendations for the patient, parent, family and community in the treatment of the condition.The textbook is appropriate for medical students, residents, practicing physicians and nurses."
3,"Suggestive, but not nude","If you're looking for this type of plot with skin, look at 'the wife swappers'. This movie was very suggestive, but there's no real nudity. Some great sexy swim suits and lingerie though. I wish the blond in this flick woulda got topless!!"
3,Swap Meet,"I enjoyed ""Suburban Roulette"" more than I thought I would. I'm not sure about the swinging lifestyle and didn't think this movie was for me. However, Herschell Gordon Lewis, who doesn't shy away from the exploitation of the subject, manages to probe the complexities of such arrangements. A single relationship is complex enough without adding more relationships. Yes, you will multiply the fun, but you multiply the hang-ups too.Characters are one-dimensional, but I guess that's what you expect when you have to keep track of a number of interacting characters. A moral film despite the subject matter.I am disappointed in the packaging of Sinister Video DVD-Rs. The film's title is misspelt on the side of the cover and there is no info about the film and its credits on the back. I think I should have bought the Something Weird DVD instead."
2,"Russian Roulette, Anyone?","[SURBURBAN ROULETTE -(1967)- Directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis] Early pioneer of the infamous 60's ""nudie cuties"" and no-budget horror flicks (though some had their moments regardless) H.G.Lewis again strikes out in what's probably the first American film involving suburban wife-swapping. Yessiree folks: Infidelity! Booze parties! Drugs! Orgies! And of course, backyard barbecues! Well, before you say ""Sign me up"", let me advise all potential viewers that this flick's tame, even by 1967's standards, and there's nary a sign of nudity, profanity or sleaze to be had anywhere. It's a cheesy soap opera morality play that teases and never delivers - it's like trying to get a lap dance at a christian singles get together, so pass on this one. There may only be one bullet in the chamber when playing Russian Roulette, but I can assure you that you'll be the one biting the bullet after this purchase."
5,Interesting for research,I rented this book but in the end I purchased as it was an easy going light readying with simple everyday samples. Recommended to just the ones who are studying environment.
3,It was fair,This book was recieved with out a jacket. Other than that it was in perfect condition. It was written in an overly complicated style.The use of charts and diagrams was ok but they did not always relate directly to the text. The organization of the rtext into short sections did make understanding what the author was trying to say easier.
4,"Loved it, mostly.","This is the first in the Hap and Leonard series and maybe the best of the books. There is a strong sense of humour throughout the work and a feeling of comradeship with the two lead characters.The men are not incredibly brave, good looking or intelligent but they are real.The story is pretty entertaining although a smidgen improbable, but very much worth a read."
5,"Beware, one Lansdale book will hook you","Now that I've read all three of his earlier soft cover books, I will buy and read his new hard cover book. This series is great."
2,IN A NUTSHELL--A 3 DAY READ,IT WAS OKAY--IT KILLED 3 DAYS.I SAW A COMPARISON---LANSDALE TO A KING / PARKER MIXTURE.SORRY--I DON'T SEE IT---BUT---A HARMLESS READ.
4,A nice literary snack,"At less than 200 pages, it does not overstay its welcome. In fact, this was the perfect length for this story. Hap and his friend Leonard (who we are told in no uncertain terms is a gay black man) are asked by Hap's ex-wife Trudy to help her find the money from a bank robbery committed by someone her current husband knew. That's the main plot that this is based on. From then on, however, everything goes wrong.There are no gray areas here, everyone is either good or bad, and there are some very bad people here. Some of the scenes are particularly gruesome, but Lansdale's writing carries one through. The characterizations save this one from being common-grade pulp. I would probably pursue Hap and Leonard through other adventures. I will most certainly pick up another of Joe Lansdale's novels."
3,"I hate the word ""thriller"" but....","This was the second of Lansdale's novels I'd read, and it's a great intro to Hap and Leonard (these guys appear in several novels of his at this point).The characters are not only very well-rounded and fully realized, but I felt like they were old friends of mine by the time the book was done.More so, the writing style is just so much fun; the man's got these wonderful turns-of-phrase, and, unlike so many books today, it's not ""Written for the screen."" It's an actual book. There's more than just dialogue on these here pages.Good stuff. Only 3 stars b/c ""Mucho Mojo"" and ""Two-Bear Mambo"" are even better."
5,Perfect in it's niche,"This is an odd case for me. Landsdale is among my favorite living writers, and the Hap and Leonard novels are some of his best. But he's not someone I'd recommend to everyone, and his work will likely never have universal appeal(not that this is a bad thing). It's occasionally violent, often strange,and rarely relies on the typical descriptive cliches even the best writers dip into as a matter of course.If you're not the type to be easily offended though, and you're willing to take the ride, Lansdale is one of the very best, and Savage Season is a good start to the wonders of that world."
4,Gigante is El Gigante for Hap and Leonard,"Reader Phil Gigante gets to the heart of the novel through his performance that spans five CDs and five hours in this unabridged presentation of the first of a planned ""Hap and Leonard"" series by author Joe R. Lansdale.The reading - changing voices/accents for the variety of male and female characters - captures the balance between witty humor and vicious existential nihilism surrounding the personalities and adventures of good ol' Texas boy Hap and his best friend, Leonard, who is a gay, martial arts-practicing Viet Nam veteran. They have a plan to pursue some easy money that will take care of all their troubles, but their plot quickly unravels and sends the duo stumbling down a path of great intrigue.Gigante comes up huge and the listener is the beneficiary as Hap and Leonard bound through their foibles while in pursuit of their variation of the American Dream."
5,And the Truth Shall Set You Free,"I've read many of Crabb's works in the past and this is one of the best.To be absolutely honest his writing style is a bit redundant and disjointed but once you get over that you realize that you are getting life changing truth. In this book Crabb brings to light some of the underlying assumptions about life that weigh us down without our knowledge. With his help we can identify some of the things that keep us defeated when God intended us to be free. This book has helped me to be ""transformed by the renewing of [my] mind."""
4,The Pressure is really Off,"I really like Crabb's perspective on life. In this book, he explains how he's arrived at the conclusion that life isn't about performing to meet someone's expectations. In his and in my case, that would be God's expectations.He argues convincingly that when we want God's blessings more than we want God, those blessings become our god and we set ourselves up for profound disappointment.(Admittedly, I didn't get all the way through the book because my wife took it, read it, and gave it to my sister to read before I could get it back.)This could be one of Crabb's most powerful contributions to personal spiritual formation, but because he personally grappling with his main point as he writes, it's a little challenging to access, although it makes the reading much more intimate.I highly recommend this book!"
5,Fish like it,The pellets are small. The guppies like it. It floats long enough to be mostly consumed. I will buy again (I wish it came in larger quantities).
3,Great trivet,I got my Kuchenprofi Expandable Trivet some 14 years ago. It works very well with one exception. But I do hope that the problem got fixed in the last few years.The trivet has little screwed on balls and some of them liked to fall off. When I adjusted the shape of the trivet the balls started to get loose and they liked to fell off when the trivet got moved to a different place. This was a little bit annoying. I therefore found a place next to the stove and left it there. It does look great on the countertop and is of heavy quality. Overall I did not regret having bought this trivet.
4,Masfield gives a step by step approach to word.,"Mansfield gives the user the opportunity to follow steps easily. The book is easy to understand and follow. The author also provides instruction in the book that generally isn't found in Word manuals, like how to create a table of contents and how to create an index. This is a good reference Word book to keep around for when you cannot remember how to do something or for when you need to teach yourself a new skill."
3,Not One of dePaola's Better Books,"While the illustrations are cute, the plot is severely strained. Perhaps a toddler can appreciate being all dressed to play in the snow and having to go back and be annoyingly undressed to use the bathroom. That's about all Santa does in this board book. Nice art, next to nothing of a story line."
4,Santa Gets Dressed,This is a great book to share with youngsters that will be transitioning off of diapers
4,Works,"I bought the backpack version of the Medela Pump In Style Advanced to use at home, and this item to keep at work since they have the hospital grade pumps. I've only used them a handful of times and am satisfied. The only downside is the tubing builds condensation. I don't have this problem with my electric pump at home. Other than that I am happy with the purchase."
5,Great functional item.,"Arrived promptly, great item to use with the Medela symphony. I've used this product three times a day for three months now, and have not had any complaints. Easy to clean, easy to use."
4,Good item,it was a better deal than the other stores and it was brand new and good item. It was the original Medela part
4,exactly what I ordered,product was exactly what I ordered and arrived before the expected date. very happy! Would recommend this product to other nursing women in need of this style connection.
2,Kit only comes with medium size flange,"After several increasingly painful weeks, we called Medela and were told that the kit is designed with different sized flanges. For $45, Medela should pack all $.10 of extra flanges so you can pick the right size that works for you. We were ignorant as to the sizing options (not for lack of attending classes or researching pumping) but just that *no one* ever talked about having different size flanges. There's not even any indication on the box. You will have to find someone to ""fit"" you if end up getting abrasions on the nipple or (due to inadequate suction from poor sizing) a clogged duct."
1,was not satisfied,This product was not what I had been wanting to order and was labeled on the site as something different and was not able to be returned. I am not a happy customer.
3,Enjoy the book - ignore the details,"Dugard's slightly fanciful account of Cook's voyages certainly makes for an entertaining read - I read it cover-to-cover on a recent trip to Hawaii.However, despite the lively, engaging style, it is a bit scant and even sloppy in some areas - particularly the account of Cook's interaction with Australian Aborigines near present day Cooktown and the Easter Island encounter.That said, I enjoyed it."
4,Fine Intro to Captain Cook,"I enjoy non fiction books of interesting historical characters. This book is an excellent introduction to Captain Cook and his almost unbelievable career. This book is well written and with enough detail to give the reader a good sense of Cooks career and character. This is not a tedious history complete with mind numbing detail. It is an interesting and breezy account of a fascinating man with an almost unbelievable tenacity and drive to succeed. Dugards colorful descriptions of the main characters is well done indeed. In addition to Captain Cook we meet such notables as Lord Sandwich, Joseph Banks, and Cooks long suffering wife Elizabeth. If you like true life adventure stories, and learning about great explorers, you will enjoy this book."
4,Fun Read,This was a very enjoyable read. Fast-paced and descriptive. I feel like I got a very good sense of Cook's explorations and his psychology.
1,Painfully flawed,"While the subject is fascinating, so many inaccuracies crop up that it makes the rest questionable. Inaccuracies such as the proper names of Royal Navy ranks and ship construction, which are hard to overlook. Hasn't he done the research? Is he dumbing it down for a general, nonspecialist audience? Is the 'adventure story' taking precedence over the facts?By contrast, some other biographies of the era (such as Patrick O'Brian's 'Joseph Banks: A Life') are reliable both in detail and in general. You can depend on the author's having done the research.I hope the author takes the time to edit and improve this in the second edition. For the moment, I cannot recommend it."
5,"Vaughan Williams 6th, with Bryden Thomson and the LSO","This is an excellent CD in every way...first rate performances from the musicians, and great recorded sound quality. I purchased it to get the 6th Symphony, but was also very happy to have the Tuba Concerto, wonderfully performed by Patrick Harrild."
4,Simple and easy,"This is a good product! Simple, cheap and it works. Great for those of us with older gadgets and newer PCs."
4,Great Product,This was exactly what I ordered and was a great product. It was a little hard to install the drivers. But I would definitely recommend this seller to anyone.
3,A serial port that almost fit,"This cables unlimited serial port for a PCI card slot works fine for my application. Once physically installed in my computer, WinXP found it automatically and installed the needed driver with no intervention from me.Installation glitches prevent me from givng it a five star rating even though the card performs well:1) The slot for the mounting screw was too small to fit my Dell Inspirion. I had to open it up slightly with a file. If you do this, carefully blow all the metal debris off the card before installation.2) The instrctions are vague and refer only to Win98 or previous operating systems. The part number for the I/O card don't match to driver files on the provided CD. Note that no drivers are needed for WinXP, Vista or Win7, only for the earliers operating systems."
4,Exhaust Clamp,Item came earlier than expected. They said this item wouldn't fit my van but was an exact match to what I had on before which the muffler shop put on. Could be the muffler shop put this one on because of the price. Harder to put on than I thought. Not sure if it was the way the manufacturer produced it or not.
2,"Bracket fits Walker muffler, original caravan bracket did not",Got this for a 1999 Dodge Caravan that needed a new muffler. Bought the Walker 21275 Quiet flow 3 muffler. 1st tried the original stainless steel muffler clamp as it was in good shape. Problem was it did not fit the contour of the new muffler even after trying to bend it into shape. Used this new Walker muffler clamp. Had to rotate the clamp 180 degrees and use the longer original bolt to engage (bolt supplied was too short). Also had to cut the original nut off the old assembly so I didn't need to go to the hardware store to buy a matching bolt. Final result was fine but didn't exactly work as advertised.
5,Some older books are great!,Just to keep this short: For a few dollars you can get an older book (this uses the traditional descriptive notation) that is very humorous and insightful. The key is learning the deep principles of playing combinations--not just doing lots of puzzles. So this is primarily an instructional text that can be read in a few days and will be of value for anyone rated below expert level. Good Reading!
2,What an annoying author,"""Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good books."" -Jack HandeyNo, this wasn't a good book, but it often felt like the author was there talking to me, which is why I found this book annoying. It seemed Mark Bego can't end a paragraph without verbally winking at the reader. Once he concluded with ""Oh that Cher, always so practical!"" Please, sir, just tell it like it is. This book could have done without the constant reminders that the author is there."
5,Love this One,I think this If you Believe is fantastic and recommend it to everyone who likes to feel good. Is fun fast and makes you want to Dance.
2,"Big price, Tiny bottle","I don't mind paying more for good hair products, but I didn't think this worked any differently than any other conditioner I have ever used. Not worth the money at all."
5,Very interesting performance of Beethoven's rare work,"Imai successfully plays Schubert's 'Arpeggione' Sonata without changing key and with minimum alteration of original pitch (it is inevitable to play an octave higher sometimes). Her performance is characteristically non-romantic, but her passion for this work is evident. Beethoven's Notturno Op.42 is an another thing. This is originally an arrangement by Beethoven himself of his Op.8 Serenade into viola and piano, but the available score is Primrose's edition only and this is not the version accepted by Imai for the present recording. Her powerful, non-romantic approach is a remarkable success for my ears. Recommended for viola fans."
1,Don't bother!!,Very dangerous! My daughter was constantly tipping over on this bike. The handle bars turn too sharp and just dump them over. There is only one good thing about it. The seat puts the child higher than the pedals and they can use their weight to get it going. This helped my daughter learn to pedal. The constant nose dive however....was not worth it. Don't buy!!
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$ AND TIME...AND bANDAIDS,"TRIKE TIPS OVER EVERYTIME MY 2 YR OLD TRIES TO GET ON THE ---- THING!!!!! SO DISSAPPOINTING FOR RADIO FLYER!!!THE BACK SEAT COMES UP TO HIGH FOR THE KIDS TO GET ON AND OFF BY THEM SELVES,,,THAT IN ITSELF TIPS THE TRIKE OVER ALSO."
3,Too small!,"My daughter received this for her 3rd birthday. It's super cute, but alas, it's too small. It's supposed to be 2-4 years, and she's average size. But she's having a hard time pedaling because it's too small. I have to bend down and push her along to make much progress. Quality is OK. Lots of style, a bit short on substance."
5,Never had one when i was lil'..........,I wish i was little again!:( It goes by soo fast that when you're a lil' kid you don't even realize how good youve got it and then you grow up and it's like a flashback!!:( :( Sad...very sad....i would haved loved to have a pink trike when i was little but i had a dumb red one insted!!! Its a great trike.....very cute! By the way i'm 12....later...peace
4,"Overall, it's a good bike","My daughter received this bike for Christmas when she was 2 and a half. Overall, it's been a great bike for her and she rides it almost everyday. The little bucket in back is great for her sippy cup or her dolls. I have noticed that it occasionally tries to tip over, but she reacts by sticking her feet out to catch herself, so she's never wiped out. However, the one thing i'm dissatisfied with is it's weather resistance. In order to keep it looking new, you have to bring it in every night, which we did at first, but now we leave it outside on the patio all the time. The two screws on the seat are not sealed over with anything, so they've rusted. Also, the plastic parts have no UV protection, so they faded after about a week of leaving it outside. Granted, we live in Texas where it's 400 degrees, but I still think they should have weatherproofed it a little better. Overall, for the price and the amount of play my daughter has gotten out of it, it's a great buy."
1,Not Safe - tips too easily,"We purchased this bike for christmas for our 2 year old daughter. She was pushing it around but not pedling it. Well, now after 4 months she is ready to ""ride her bike"" but everytime she gets on and gets going, turning a corner, it tips her off and she gets hurt. The distance between the back wheels and the front wheel is too close (easy folding) making the bike very easy to tip over and she falls on her head and shoulder, pinning her under the bike. I do not recommend this tri cycle for anyone that wants to encourge riding all we've had is tears,scars and now she doesn't want to ride anything, for fear of falling off. We are off today to find a new bicycle that will help her, not frighten her."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BIKE!!!!,"I cannot believe Radio Flyer put this bike out! Every single time my 2 year old got on this thing, it toppled over!I actually called Radio Flyer, they denied ever hearing any complaints about this model (then I found out there are plenty of angry parents out there!) After some resistance, they agreed to refund me and they did.The back wheels are too close together, making it very easy to tip over, plus the fact that it is so lightweight makes it even more unstable. I tried it too in the store on smooth ground, but on the sidewalk, forget it!Please save yourself the trouble!"
5,Little Heard But Excellent,"I've loved this album since I first heard it some 20 years ago. Coverdale's voice never sounded better than on this album -- if all you've ever heard of him is from Whitesnake's metal days, this will surprise you. But then again if you're only into Whitesnake's metal days, you probably won't like this album. It's more indicative of earlier, bluesy Whitesnake but - for my money - better than anything they did. Great stuff."
2,"A lot of sound bites, not much meat!","Strategic Marketing in Telecommunications does not live up to the reader's expectations. Maureen Rhemann does not provide enough actionable recommendations about how to market a product mix in the telecommunications industry. The author uses a lot of buzzwords and tired phrases to describe what is going on in the industry. Furthermore, Rhemann needs to pay better attention to the organization of her book. The author regularly repeats herself without adding much value to her message. Finally, Rhemann oversells her Texas-based consulting practice through the book to the annoyance of her readers."
2,A firm commitment to playing it by ear.,"A light-hearted, superficial read for anyone interested in learning the new buzz words and hyperbole of the industry. The book is useful insofar as it sets the tone of the telecoms revolution, however it ultimately avoids analysis. The text is as hurried as the synthesis of ideas is absent. The outlook is curiously Texas-based. The use of strategic marketing in the title is really misleading as the book provides little new insight in this area."
3,Intriguing book,"I love mysteries, and always look for them on Amazon. This was more detective story but was written quite well and I enjoyed it very well."
4,Enjoyable read.,"Looking forward to reading the next in the series ""True Crime"". Very interesting read of author blending history and fiction."
3,"Interesting, but not great","This was kind of a strange mystery novel. The historical characters fit in quite nicely (Eliot Ness, FDR and even Ronald Reagan). The real mystery was a missing persons case, and the story seemed to dwell more on name-dropping and peripheral descriptions than on what was actually happening. Not much suspense, and I ended up not really caring about any of the characters, but it did have an interesting twist."
3,Enjoyable crime story with some history I wasn't familiar with,"This is a solid read, and a promising start to a detective series that I'll probably try more of in the future. It's a hardboiled mystery, but generally avoids feeling too much like a cliche by using characters with a little more complexity than your typical crime fiction. The meticulous attention to historical detail adds a level of realism to the book. If it errs anywhere, it may be in cramming in so many historical references. By the last third of the novel, some of the celebrity cameos start to feel forced, in spite of the fact that, yes, they could have been around in that region at that time. A couple times I felt as if chapters existed mainly to spotlight the tremendous amount of research that must have gone into this book, but for the most part, the narrative still moves along quickly. If you like classic detective fiction, you should enjoy it."
3,Historcal fiction,"I almost put the book down after 2 chapters, setting the family history background was quite boring to me and could have been incorporated throughout the novel. The story line, however, was good, not great, instead of a page turning detective story it turned into an early 30's Chicago documentary with many historical references. I enjoyed it since I was born in Chicago."
2,Vogue,Those looking for the excitement of a thriller should look elsewhere. All too often this reads like a fashion magazine.
2,Great concept but unreliable,"My first unit was also DOA, second worked fine for 11 months and then failed. It registered ok with the T6c watch but erratic / intermittent speed recording.The grooves for the battery cover are also a little flimsy - easy to strip off if you don't get it aligned just right.that said, the Suunto gear is great at recording data and providing feedback, just not so good at interval trainingCheers"
4,Better then Polar,Had Polar and am now switching to Suunto. You can either wear the HRM or mount it on the handlebars if you want to keep tracking your performance. Information is consistently accurate.
3,Poor Packaging & Quality,"I love all the MTM's, however I'm so disappointed in the 5th & 6th year packaging. It's poor, cheap quality is a real let down and does not match with the first four seasons. After returning the the broken case for the 6th season, I have now dicovered that disc 3 is defective in several areas........no sound, and/or feezing up.Mary Tyler Moore would NOT be happy!"
4,Mary Tyler Moore,It came on time and was in great condition. I am happy with it. I cant wait to get the last season of Mary Tyler Moore.
5,Anxiously awaiting Season 7,"Could care less about packaging etc, love this show and each season is better and better...hoping season 7 is around the corner.."
4,Mary Tyler Moore season six,We enjoy the older TV shows much more than the newer ones. This season won't disappoint if you enjoyed any of MTM series.
4,Better than Season 5,"Funnier and better. I still don't know why it looks so cheaply put together. No episode listing; it could have added the Emmy awards acceptance for ""Chuckles."" Could have had adding Betty White as a regular cast member etc...but still one of the funniest ever TV series and looking forward to the last season."
4,Another plea for the final episode curtain call!!!,"Yes, I too would like to BEG Fox to restore the final episode's original ending where Mary and the cast make their final appearance in front of the applauding audience. I vaguely remember this from the original airing when I was 10 years old and have not seen in since in all my years of watching reruns. Please don't leave out this critical and nostalgic nod to one of the greatest comedies ever made. Thanks!!"
4,Mary Tyler Moore- Season Six,"The sixth season is funny and entertaining, but it lacks the variety from previous years due to the absence of characters like Rhoda and Phyllis."
4,Sometimes we need to be wired,"Enjoyed this great little book as I always do Kerasote's writing. I wanted to read it because he had written an article in an outdoor magazine 15 years ago on ""Camping Beyond Aid"" and I wanted to compare his thoughts then and now.But no matter: while camping ""beyond aid"" in the wilderness two weeks later, I developed a life-threatening medical condition that required Air Force helicopter evacuation.That sat phone sure would have come in handy."
2,Dissapointing,"Ordered this because it was suggested by Amazon as a book that might be of interest. This because I am so very fond of David Petersen's writing. Kerasote can't hold a candle to Petersen! He does not enlarge his subject to include any of the larger insights or issues, of which there are many imbedded in the subject of man and nature. From Melville to Petersen, we have struggled to describe and comprehend our relationship to society and nature. Kerasote adds little to the discussion."
3,good if you just want to practice the multiple choice part,"This book contains many multiple choice tests. Although it contains a glossary, there are no explanations of answers. There is nothing for the open-ended questions. However, the sheer quantity of tests makes it helpful for rote memorization and test practice."
4,Bad instructions,"The instructions say to push down on the knob, but all that did was shove the rubber coupler all the way up into it. I will need forceps to get it out. More likely I will go to the hardware store and get something better. Aside from that, I like the aesthetics."
2,2007 Saturn Vue Floor Guard,"Great Pricing, but does NOT fit 2007 Saturn Vue. (Designed for a full-sized Pick-Up Truck.)"
2,Too expensive here,"Don't bother buying it used here...It only cost $31 for a new hardback from the publisher (Higginson Book Company) and only $17 currently for a paperback. Good information, though."
4,review,"We purchased this product to use as a learning tool for our grand-daughter, she had been trouble learning to read. It was very helpful."
1,Wristband is NOT for a woman's wrist,I love Freestyle watches but this wristband is HUGE......not made for an average size woman. I'm not talking about the width is the band. I can slide this off my wrist when it's closed......so don't order this watch unless you want to replace the band before you get this watch......I am totally disappointed in this watch.
5,One reason to buy this book....,"....To make a glock full-auto. It is a 58 page book that gives you step by step instructions on how to turn a glock fully automatic including blue prints and schematics, its rather user friendly and easy to do. There is nothing else in this book other than directions to do what I mentioned above."
1,Glock,"I was VERY disapointed with this book. If all you want to know about is converting the glock to full auto, you might like it, that is all it covers."
2,not the movie I thought it was,I had thought that this was the new TV serries by the same name. It was not. I consider this my faulot for not checking clooser.
4,"Lush details, beautiful writing","I really liked this book although I agree with the reviewer here that it was hard to understand the motivations of the characters (like Gentile). Still, the story is interesting and the writing well done. It reminded me some of Ellen Kushner's work."
5,Rich in flavor!,"The Stars Dispose is an unusual historical fantasy. More attention seems to be placed in providing a rich description of the food rather than a system of magic. However, the plot is a slow seduction of the reader, giving view to just enough of the threat facing the characters that the reader is eager to turn the next page. A plethora of Italian names may be confusing, but a glossary at the back helps."
5,Covers a diversity of subjects,"Perfect Plant Perfect Place by horticultural expert Roy Lancaster is a simply magnificent, detailed, and user friendly ""how to"" guide to gardening that positively overflows with more than 1800 vibrant color photographs. Packed from cover to cover with descriptions of and basic care instructions for recommended plants for indoor or outdoor gardening, Perfect Plant Perfect Place is the ideal book for beginning to intermediate gardeners seeking to select just the right species of beauty to best decorate a home, lawn, or greenhouse. A most thorough, practical and enjoyable presentation, Perfect Plant Perfect Place covers a diversity of subjects from acidic soil, raised beds, plants for paved areas, and herbs in the kitchen, to rock garden bulbs, aquatic plants, containers in the sun, and urban back yards. If you can have access to only one gardening guide, make it Roy Lancaster's Perfect Plant Perfect Place."
5,Perfect Book,"This is the most useful gardening book ever. Cross-referenced by soil, color and type, this is the one gardening book to select plants and trees. A minor caveat; I wish he had included more American common plant names. I wish Lancaster would write a similiar book on trees alone."
4,Packed with vibrations,"4 1/2This is a Metheny release of the adventurous variety, and quite a consistently engaging one at that. A bit overstuffed in spots perhaps but to me these are my favorite types of releases from one of our greatest jazz guitarists- seventy plus minutes of filler-free compositional free fall. Pat functions best in the middle of this persistent forward-thrusting seek, always appeasing music freaks with complicated arrangements, and never sounding overly intellectual so to scare away casual admirers."
4,"Good, but nothing new from PMG","On first listening, I thought most of the tracks were pretty good. As I listened to it more, they began to sound more like throw-away tracks from ""Imaginary Day"" than an entirely new album. With very few exceptions, the songs are predictable, unimaginative, and at times very repetitive. I still like this CD but it doesn't live up to the level I know PMG are capable of, not to mention my own expectations."
4,"PMG broadens the same envelope, but the stage is set...","PMG broadens the same envelope, but the stage is set for both the current tour and the albums to come. With such huge changes in the group, the choice was made to stay close to recent roots. Therefore, if you like the albums of the late 80s and early 90s, then this is a much better pick due to its depth on many levels. (Just read what other reviewers say!) If you're hoping for a ""Second Circle"" refusion of Metheny's straight jazz performances (Song X or something with DeJohnette or Trio Live, etc.), then this is NOT it. However, this group is clearly up to that challenge if they choose. Let's hope they continue that path through on-stage improvisations and the albums to come. So, their stage is set for ""the next higher level"" that could again truly redefine jazz-fusion-rock and blow everyone away as was done by ""American Garage"" 1979 and ""Song X"" 1986."
1,A Huge disappointment,"As a big fan of the PMG I have to say that I am very disappointed in this effort. I have strained my ears to hear the innovative chords, melodies and cultural journies that we've all become accustomed to hearing with each new PMG album. All I hear is some great piano work from Lyle (as usual) and... well, fluff. That's the best way I can describe it. Predictable, mechanical, formula-powered fluff. Oh well. Even Pat (God though he is) can't always amaze...."
5,Yet another master work..,"Pat Metheny is one of those very rare artists who stirs my soul whenever I listen to his music. This new CD is yet another reflection of his ongoing growth as a master of producing sound that literally transports me to the most wonderful places. His music is uplifting to the soul and speaks to the spirit. If you are new to Pat, toss out the garbage and fill your CD rack with his music. The man never ceases to amaze me!! He is one of those artists that produces CD after CD of music that I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO!! Thank you Pat Metheny for producing such wonderful music."
4,Another Great Effort,"I really liked this CD. Not as much as ""We Live Here"" which remains a constant on my CD player, but ""Speaking of Now"" is still a great effort. The first song ""As It Is"" is the most traditional sounding PMG song on the CD. After listening to it, you would think that the whole album would be that way, but the rest of the tracks are very varied in their artistry. I liked the addition of the trumpet player, and the vocals on ""Another Life"" are hauntingly beautiful. Great job!"
3,"Great!, but...","The group has come up with a collection of sunny and bright tunes that that are wonderfully orchestrated and realized.However, I do not care much for the last two tunes, (I find them to be melodically annoying) even though I'd have a hard time picking ANY PMG tunes I didn't like from other albums.The other seven tunes are typically terrific PMG material, I just wish there was a song or two with a darker or blues influenced sound.(IE, Roots of Coincidence)I don't think it's as compositionally interesting as Imaginary Day but still a terrific album. Not many artists make music this well thought out anymore."
2,I Gave It A Few Tries,"I've given this one a few listens. I've tried leaving it for a while and then coming back to it. Nothing helps. This album is just too formulatic. It tries to do too much, and winds up accomplishing nothing. I'll hold off on buying any more ""PMG"" albums. Here's hoping Pat leaves the ""Group"" behind and sticks to other projects."
2,It Had To Happen,"PMG has tanked. This CD goes almost entirely in the opposite direction we have expected of PMG - it goes not to new territory but to completely uninspired rehashing of the old arrangements, riffs and what once were original, other-worldly sounds from electronic instruments. Once PMG inspired. Now they de-spire. The production sound is so muddled it is embarrasing. I have bought every Pat Metheny (The Group or otherwise) CD I could find but this one is already in my backroom CD rack. A trumpet is all that is new here. I believe it is playing taps....."
2,"sadly, it does seem like a formula","As usual, I was quite excited to see that the Pat Metheny Group had a new release. I'm afraid I have to agree with another reviewer that this CD seems like it follows a formula. Nice, melodic songs, but no real fire, no real artistry... it seems like the whole band (yes, even Lyle Mays and Steve Rodby) are simply going through the motions. We own all of the group albums, and this one simply doesn't cover any new ground (or interesting old ground). Disappointing."
5,A magick carpet ride on the space time continuum!!,"I don't know what that means exactly but the words came to me while listening to this amazing CD. Ethereal, exceptional and inspiring, the musical bar has certainly been raised a few notches with this release from the Pat Metheny Group.Few CDs captivate from beginning to end, this one does.If only the world were as perfect as this music!"
1,"Boring, unlistenable","I love Metheny, but, if you have nothing to say, don't make an album. I can't even listen to it, it is so trite. I don't think I heard one melody. The CD sounds like a collection of the middle or endings of their older, inferior songs. And we used to get some time before the guitar synth was introduced, now it hits you in the first song. I would challenge Pat to put this collection into a songbook, I'd like to see the lead sheets-no melody, just chords. And to add insult to injury, I played Letter From Home this weekend. How far the fall!"
3,Same old same old,"The songs on this CD sound like they were taken from older Metheny albums - much older albums, from other a decade ago. Metheny is one of the most respected and talented jazz guitarists out there and there is no denying his complete mastery of his instrument, as the talents of the people who work with him. But it seems like in terms of depth and composition this CD is a failure - the compositions seem bland. Once again we are treated to the synth-guitar sound of Metheny, the trills of Lyle Mays' piano, etc ... The best Metheny album in my opinion is Secret Story. This new CD is just a shadow of it."
1,Lame and boring,"WOW! Yet another disappointment from Metheny...this disc is tired, lifeless and extremely formalic and boring. AVOID at all costs...Metheny seems to be running out of ideas."
2,Out of New Ideas,"Others here have said it, so I won't rub salt in the wound. But this sounds like outtakes from far better MPG albums. Our Golden Boys (Metheny & Mays) have clearly run out of anything new to say. From the Moogy whining synth guitar, to the old keyboard echo flourishes, to the predictable (and forced-sounding) crescendos, this is tired and disappointing. And while we're at it - why replace the amazing Mr. Wertico.et.al.? Did he perhap not want to partake of this ""new"" material.? I'd hardly blame him.I have every PMG and solo project out and I always look forward to a new one. Perhaps it's time the boys take a break and re-think the next. They're far better than this."
2,Sign of Decline,"Don't waste your money. I just did at the local Wherehouse. This latest CD is a huge disappointment and can be summed up with one word: WEAK! I own all of Pat Metheny's various studio releases, both with his band and other collaborations, and while some were a little difficult to digest for being unusual, this release falls flat on its face for being formulaic and uninspired/uninspiring. I just wanted to warn potential buyers: spend your money on something else."
5,One of the best of PMG's recent albums.,"This very clean CD makes a good companion to the more electrically charged DVD, Speaking of Now Live.Given a choice between the two, however, I think I would go with the DVD... the latter has more selections -- and more of Richard Bona, whose stellar virtuosity doesn't project through on the CD."
3,DT's on Metheny's Speaking of Now,"Love it, yet compared to THE WAY UP, it's not at that level. I guess my problem is that I got SPEAKING OF NOW too late and after I got THE WAY UP. Still, Pat Metheny Group is the best!Enjoy,Diego TaylorPanama"
3,More of the Same,"Here's why I rate this CD with only 3 stars. I've been a loyal PMG, Metheney's and Lyle Mays' solo career follower for many years. I simply decided not to buy this CD, after listening to it carefully, because it accentuates on me the feeling that from ""Still Life, Talking"" up to these days, these guys are stuck into a formula repeating circle. There's no doubt that they are terrific performers/composers/arrangers and you can see that in any of their concerts, but at the shows they keep playing their ""classics"" too. I certainly hope their minds and creativity are not over and done. Albums like ""Quartet"" or ""Trio 99/00"" still blow some winds of hope.With the stars I'm only rating the individual/group performance, trying to recognize and be respectful with Metheney/Mays and the long way they walked, giving us such great albums as ""Offramp"", ""First Circle"", ""As Falls Wichita..."", etc."
5,Eureka! PMG Strikes Gold,"This album's like panning for gold. Every track's a giant nugget - rich, dense, a pure motherlode of complex free flowing PMG instrumentation. Metheny is the ultimate miner of musical treasures. Can't wait to the next release!"
2,Pleasant but Formulaic and Stale,"I bought my first Pat album back in 1978 and have been a huge fan going back to the Phase Dance days and I know this will be an unpopular review. But PMG's periodic output has suffered greatly over the past ten to 15 years. This latest offering is proof positive that the writing, right down to the obligatory ballad with classical guitar, and arrangements are just stamped out for the masses. It is all very pretty and pleasant but Pat and Co. don't ever challenge themselves as a group anymore and thus never produce any albums these days that are as consistently astonishing as First Circle or even We Live Here. There may be a quality tune or so on each album but not much more. The contrast is striking if you look at how Pat challenges himself in so many different ways outside of PMG."
5,Very Cool,The group has new found energy and talent. The 3 new additions are incredible musicians and add a new drive and chemistry to this already fine group. Sanchez is an incredible addition on drums. Just saw them on their tour in Detroit. Better in person. Hard to believe.
3,A jazz listener is disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I love Pat Methenys works in general, but this album sounds like a rehash of his earlier works. Basically, I think he as an artist has eclipsed this group members. I'veenjoyed his more recent albums with great players like OrnetteColeman ,Roy Haynes. The tunes on the album are good, its just that I can't take the piano synth sound which is old sounding and makes alot of the tunes sound the same. I was disappointed that the vocals had no lyrics. I liked the trumpeter, bassist and drumer but none of them weredistinguished."
1,"Sorry, can't listen to this one anymore","OK, I'm a big PM fan, I own at least 10 discs of his. I really think he's lost it. This is the most generic disc he's ever produced, following a trend that started with We Live Here. SoN will not offend anyone; this disc does not contain a single song that has any significant emotion or dynamics. I can't believe the man who produced Secret Story and Wichita Falls came up with this monotonous, blatantly commercial drivel. Strictly by the numbers. I bought this disc and listened to it on the way home. The next morning, I went right back for a refund. A huge disappointment for me. After 9/11, how could Metheny produce such perfect Muzak? I guess many great artists lose their energy after awhile. Pat sure has.I guess it's great for the Berkeley/Marin County mild leftie-Vegan types who drive to Whole Foods with Free Tibet and No War For Oil stickers on their sport-utes."
1,a review,"I was very disappointed on hearing just one cut from this album. It seems Matheney hasn't evolved any since ""Off Ramp"" or ""Secret Storie"". While the songs are well-mixed and balanced, there is no new stuff that is unique or soul-searching. It seems Matheny is just repeating the same riffs off the older albums in a hybrid form. Too many notes, but too little soul or fascinating lyricism like the album ""Missouri skies."""
2,un'attesa un po' delusa,"L'evoluzione del Pat Metheny Gruop, ormai alla soglia dei 30 anni di attività, non poteva essere più deludente. Depauperato del talento di Paul Wertico alle batterie, a cui Antonio Sanchez non presta affatto un adeguato conforto e arricchito del dubbio talento di Cuong Wu alla tromba, resta la ritmica equilibratissima del duo Lyle Mays-Steve Rodby a fare da contorno ai continui quanto ripetitivi assolo di Pat Metheny.L'ascolto risulta essere pesante e monotono, fatta eccezione per Proof e Another Life, probabilmente i migliori brani del lavoro, un lavoro molto simile al precedente Imaginary Day e lontano anni luce dall'innovativo We Live Here e dalla perfezione timbrica di Still Life TalkingSpeaking of now sembra un disco pesante e molto approssimativo, inusualmente poco curato nella registrazione e davvero deludente.Proprio non ci siamo..."
5,Another wonderful album from PMG,"but what else would you expect? All the usual Metheny trademarks are here, the singing guitar synths, soaring wordless vocals, and of course, Pat's instantly recognizable Ibanez guitar sound. The songs are of their usual high quality. The vocals have a distinctly African tinge to them, evocative of Richard Bona's native Cameroon. Cuong Vu is a great addition to the group--his trumpet adds some welcome color to songs like ""Proof"" and ""Wherever You Go"". Longtime PMG fans will love this record and new fans will like it as well."
2,PMG descends to formula,"The formula worked before---in fact I have every PMG album since the first---but this time it's just a formula. Except for As It Is and the tune with the 5/4 samba (as a drummer I enjoy that kind of thing), the rest is, well, vapid.The new drummer sounds like a tentative version of Paul Wertico (with much less tonal variety), the new vocalist has been practically mixed out of the tracks, and the new trumpeter is so laid back he practically isn't there.Never thought I'd be ""dissin"" a PMG album, but there you go."
5,Great product,"Im am a huge Collector of New kids on the block, and also purchased one for a friend. It was delivered perfectly just like new. Would recommend seller and if you are a collector of NKOTB, this is a sure MUST have!"
1,Not what you'd think,"This product does not work at all, I just threw it away after a few attempts on several of my bowls."
5,Filled from cover to cover with numerous examples of script,"The Book Of Hebrew Script: History, Palaeography, Script Styles, Calligraphy & Design by Ada Ayardeni (an expert graphic artist and calligrapher, and who holds a doctorate in ancient Semitic language, as well as being an authority in palaeography, and epigraphy) is an outstanding and seminal 355-page illustrated reference to the evolution of Hebrew script down through the centuries. Filled from cover to cover with numerous examples of script drawn from different eras of history, and offering an extensive discourse concerning both profound and subtle variations in Hebrew script, The Book Of Hebrew Script is a core resource for professional and academic Hebrew Language Studies collections."
2,Ada Yardeni,"This title came up even before Amazon had it available. Unfortunately, I bought it before I was able to look at it carefully. The quality of the plates and illustration material are terrible, really awful. All the more so because there haven't been many new books on the subject since Cara Marks."
3,Fits very oddly,"Bought for a friend, he is 6'1 and 200lbs. Got the XL. Was HUGE around the middle, fit his shoulders and was VERY short in the sleeves. ALso, the sleeves have a button on the wrist which causes them to bunch oddly. My friend is NOT oddly shaped, he normally wears a L at Express for men. I bought the XL so he could wear sweaters underneath. Am returning. Leather was nice and seemed well made."
5,Gave as a gift,When I took this out of the packaging I knew instantly that my husband was going to love it! The leather was so soft and when my husband tried it on it was very easy to move in. He kept telling me all day how much he loved it!
5,Outstanding,"Simply put, I love this coat. It's warm - chicago area good for all except the coldest dead-of-winter days. Well constructed, and the buttery smooth soft leaather is wonderful to the touch.Not all lambskin jackets are the same and this one has exceptional softness. Ir is not a fully pitch black color. More of a extremely dark brown. For sizing, I am a 42Long suit jacket, I ordered the XL Tall....and it is a very good fit."
4,Not quite black...but nice,This coat is a nice coat but its not black...its brownish-black. I brought a pair of black leather gloves to go with the coat and THEY'RE black. I brought this coat for my husband and it's as described except the color. It's the reason I give it 4 stars instead of five.
3,Welsh ghosts and a domestic problem novel - oh my,"First off, bear in mind that Elizabeth Cody Kimmel writes wildly different types of books from year to year. Her most recent series is the ""Suddenly Supernatural"" group of four books, which I think is one of the absolutely best and most creative modern girl/ghost/adventure series available.But, ""In the Stone Circle"" is one of Kimmel's first efforts. It combines blended family drama with some half-baked quasi-Welsh seasoning to produce a fairly unsatisfying ghost story. It has a reasonably moody sort of feel, and a workmanlike set of characters, but I'm not sure who this is for, and I certainly wouldn't suggest it if you want a sample of Kimmel's current work. (And if you want Welsh tales, try Susan Cooper, or Jenny Nimmo, who each do a much better job of capturing the flavor of the old Welsh legends in a modern setting.)"
5,In the Stone Circle,"I am really into mysteries and history so it was really my kind of book. It's now my favorite book, it made me more interested in Wales."
5,Best Book I've Ever Read,"If you are considering buying In The Stone Circle, you should , immediatly. It is so exciting and you will want to read it over and over again. I have read it at least 4 times. It is truely a good book to have in your collection. Great for Teens. I'm 13 and Love it - so do all my friends- who i made read it!."
3,unrealistic at times,"I have to say that I was both happy with and dissapointed by this book. My overall impression was that the methodology for trying to really understand how to create a home that reflects the person you are is sound. However, I was dissapointed with much of Stoddard's descriptions of how she applies her theories in her own life. Frankly, it sounds as if she has all the time in the world to take the day at her own pace, and I was left wondering: ""Who lives like this?"" I don't know ANYone with this kind of life! At one point, she mentions that she likes to sit in her pj's and write 'till lunchtime. Me, too! But PLEEZE - who has the time for this? These kinds of 'insights' into how to live your life left me feeling frustrated."
1,The concept is OK but nothing new,"I was surprised to read the above review of the book, which states that most decorating books leave your personality out of the picture. Most decorating books omit you? That's just not true. My favorite decorrating books talk to me all the time, helping me work my life and loves into my rooms. This book doesn't do that job as well as some of my current decorating book favorites, so I'm returning it. The author seems to have discovered the personal style trend years and years after most authors and publishers!"
1,Feeling at Home: Defining Who You Are & How You Want to Live,"I really disliked this book. I felt as if the author was out of her element with this particular book. Perhaps her other books on decorating are more true to her area of expertise, but I felt as if she was attempting to be my therapist with this one, and I don't like psycho-babble. The author should save this stuff for the shrinks and stick to decorating."
2,Home Psy 1A,This book reminded me of a text book you would get for a home economics class. It had very little helpful advice and required way too much time to arrive at very simple observations that most people already have a sense of. I would not recommend it.
1,Vague and a little insulting,"I discovered that my other favorite decorating books do a much better job of inspiring me to make my home personal and giving me sound suggestions than this book. I found her premise snobbish, because she clearly thinks that she'sjust discovered this idea and that the rest of us still need to be told or convinced that putting our personalities into our homes is the thing to do. She is way behind the times and seems to just be catching on to what the rest of us have been doing in our homes for many years now. I would like to know about the author's qualifications, because I agree with an earlier reviewer who noted that this book is filled with lots of ""psycho-babble,"" too. Get a good decorating book instead of this one."
1,Silly-Sappy-Biased,"The book is sentimental in a particularly unhelpful way. It is filled with quotations from famous people, each of which may be insightful taken alone, and which together make no sense. I am very sorry I bought it."
1,Page after page of dumb questions,"I was terribly dissapointed with this book. My brain went numb as I read page after page of dumb questions about what you might do in each room. The author writes as though she is the wize, all-knowing mother and we are poor, imbecilic children in need of enlightenment. When I buy a book that is supposed to improve my home, then I expect some tips, some examples, SOME PHOTOS. Nothing like that here."
3,"Part Psychologist,Part Decorator","Alexandra Stoddard is a unique contributor to American decorating. She spins a story well and creates intriguing food for thought in an overlooked area of our lives- the physical space we dwell in ""at home"". She is a blue blood Martha Stewart who has studied philosophy and is an intuitive natural psychologist who delves into our deepest secrets based on the way we live in and run our homes. My only complaint in this book, and it is a significant one, is that her privileged background will resonate with only a select number of people and creates distance between her and many readers. I don't believe she is aware of a pretentious tone in some of her exhortations, but it certainly exists. Her reference points to ""the rest of us"" sometimes seem small and out-of-touch at times. However, the pluses outweigh the minuses and this book deserves your attention in clarifying the importance of home, wherever and however you define it."
4,Ahhh says my soul. . .,"I always enjoy reading Alexandra Stoddard's books. When I need to calm my soul and nourish the feminine, there's nothing better than Alexandra Stoddard's writing style. Feeling at Home was no exception. Really enjoyed the tips, the dialog with clients, and the overall content."
3,well....,"well, these books were a little hard getting into...the first book i thought the characters were all kinda shallow and the plot kinda thin--not to mention how obvious it was that these books were done by a female author--but by the second book (nearly midway through) i realized that the characteres were actually very complex, so maybe it just slipped by me to begin with...also, ive read other reviews that have commented on the the vellantim being so dull, and i understand the importance of having the 'bad guys' bein someone you can understand, but i really dont think that they are the 'bad guys.' the conflicts are for the most part internal with the major external being between pol and andry. so, with that said, ill go on with my own personal ravings about what ruined this whole book for me and just about made me not finish it--KAZANDER DIES!! thats the most depressing part...along with all the other favorites that die..but he was my personal favorite....so there's my review"
4,Good but not Great,"I really like Melanie Rawn as an author. She has an interseting style of telling a story although sometimes i find it hard to keep track of who is who the son or daughter of who, ect.The only problem I find is that she kills off my favorite characters."
1,VERY POOR,I ORDERED THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON OF FLAVOR OF LOVE AND IN ADDITION TO IT ARRIVING LATE & BEING OVER PRICED IT WAS THE WRONG ITEM. THE DVD EXCHANGE HAS NOT CONTACTED ME REGARDING THEIR ERROR AND I WILL NEVER DO ANY BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN. I AM NOT AT ALL SATISFIED AND I AM ONDERING IF I HAVE LOST MY MONEY!
2,Is it truly uncensored?,"Before I buy this video, I wanted to see if those of you who have purchased this DVD, if it is truly uncensored? I know that more and more, DVD producers call a DVD ""uncensored"" when in reality, they are only talking about letting the language fly free. When in reality, most people looking for ""uncensored"" are more interested in the body parts. :)So how about it? Is it truly uncensored? Does the viewer get a glimpse of an ""uncensored"" New York walking around in her lingerie? What about anything else? The 3-some shower scene?Thanks. (and if its truly uncensored, I'll bump my star rating up!) ;)"

3,Very sad. These Women go Ape-Crazy over this ugly freakin' Black guy.,"He looks crazy, and although I like His wild personality, it's just like Miss New York's show; very Un-Love-like, deceitful, fights galore (Yay!), Crazy Women in line for Someone very ugly and with no rap talent whatsoever, and Who sports the biggest clock a Human could carry.I find Him quite repulsive save for His fun side. This isn't to say that I didn't enjoy it. It was just not the greatest set up, just like Miss NY's silly show. Both - entertaining. Both - sleazy. Both went home empty-handed on the first season!And don't EVEN start, cause this is a Black on Black hate crime!

5,How does she do it?,"Cynthia Heimel makes me snicker knowingly right out loud in public. She's wise, witty, pointed, and pulls no punches. Oh, and did I mention that she's funny? Especially her alter ego, Problem Lady?I recognized people I know on almost every page of this book. I may force my boyfriend to read it. If it doesn't terrify him, it will almost definitely give us lots to talk about."
3,I love Cynthia Heimel's writing...,"...but this collection is sparse compared to earlier books. I finished this one in less than one hour, and in hindsight would not have splurged on a hardcover edition. But everyone should read Heimel - I'd give 5 stars to all her other books."
3,"""This is narcissism run rampant!""","Once upon a time this author was brilliant and I would have done almost anything to read her in print. No longer fresh, she rests upon her laurels and seems rather bitter for it."
3,"I'd read anything she writes, but still.","This book, a collection of essays interspersed with mock advice columns, wasn't (to me) QUITE the hard-hitting, poignant & outrageous material I've grown to expect from Heimel, but it was still a witty & fast read. She seems to be holding back this time, not sharing the miniutiae of her life as much, & dwelling heavily on her love of dogs, a mindset I personally don't share, though it's interesting get that viewpoint. Though a little less fresh than her earlier books, it's worth a look to get at least some feel for where Heimel is at this point in her life. Didn't come away feeling like my brain-cells were being realigned...but it's still worth a shot."
5,Boomer Basics: Everything you need to know...,Great book. Very useful tool. The book really talks to the issues I face today. A must for the library. The website and the website references really make for a complete one stop for issues facing my generation.
3,A very broad overview of a complex subject ... a primer.,"Typical Osprey book. Attempting to present the WWI British Army in the short format of an Osprey book means that the presentation will be broad and general. I was looking for specific information on the London Scottish regiment, and, by pure luck, this volume had the information I was seeking. Its strengths, as expected, were equipment and representative uniforms. Its self-admitted weakness was its orders of battle for the Western Front, Italy, and the Middle East ... they were a representative sampler, not any real appreciation of the OB's over any period of time ... the space could have been put to better use on another topic. I was particulaly frustrated by the lack of explantion of the British battalion numbering system. All in all, it is a solid volume for uniform research, a first volume for interest in the WWI British Army, and a weak volume for any reader expecting depth."
5,I apoligize - Larry The Cable Guy,"It is my opinion that Larry The Cable guy's CD of I apoligize is the best comedy CD since Dice Rules by Andrew Dice Clay and Rodney Dangerfield's, No Respect and Son of No Respect. Anyone would be hard pressed to convince me that Larry The Cable Guy is not the best comic performing today. His subjects are new and interesting and we all new a laugh for our mental well being.Dan D'AlessioRhode Island"
1,Polly Pocket vendor rips you off,"The item is a number of small Polly Pocket figures and is OK for girls from 6 to 11. The problem I encountered is it was OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED. One of the packages was priced at $39.95 and the other slightly different but with the exact number of figures was $49.95. After cancelling this order and being charged a $25 restocking fee, I proceeded to my local Target and Walmart and purchased the EXACT SAME ITEMS for $7 each! Yes, seven dollars on sale (the regular price was $9.95 at all stores I visited). So, buyer beware of anything coming from JNL TRADING. Do not do it!"
5,Sensitively conducted with spectacular Chandos sonics.,"I was never a fan of Tchaikovsky...but when I heard the opening movements of the 6th Symph...by Oslo SO with I was totally hooked.Out of print...but if you can find it used, I would whole heartedly recommend this recording. Satisfying in every way."
4,Good,"In this book, the Yeerks are working on a drug that makes humans have no free will. Read it! It's good"
3,good book,It is a good book. I like how the Animorphs have to sneek into the meet packing plant. I also like how Ax accidenty morphs a cow.
3,I love Animorphs and this just wasn't as good as the others,This book would not make other people who have never read the seriese before want to read it. I would recomend the other booksin the seriese. This one just didn't have the animorphs sound to it.
3,I like Animorphs a lot.,"For Animorphs #28 The Experiment, I really like the book a lot but there isn't as much fighting or anything at all as much as in the other Animorphs. That is all I have to say about this book"
4,OK.,"The Yeerks are desperate. They've decided that if they can invent a substance to destroy human ability to make decisions. Therefore, they can get more people infested and speed up the invasion. Now, the Animorphs have to stop the testing on a few humans. If they don't stop it now, rebellion is impossible. And the Animorphs take the elevator down right into Visser Three's arms..."
5,"OK, Cool! Way Cool!","<I think all ANIMORPHS books are cool, sure, not so bad. This one is a bit strange but I still highly prioritize them all. Ax-Man discovered TV! Him & Marvelous Marco are gonna go buy Horse-Boy a TV guide, but on the way they meet a talking Fed-Ex truck. Wait! That's no truck full of ""stuff"" that's Erek the Chee! He warns them about he's not sure how, but the Yeerks seem to be doctoring burgers. Sounds crazy? This book, other than talking trucks & TV-watching Andalites, introduces Andalite-tipping, not that it's respectful or called for at all. Now I will not tell you any more because I want you to read it!>;-D"
5,Let me lecture you on why I gave it 5 stars rather than -5.,"Ahem, now you fans, listen up, some of you haven't got the point of the book.As time changes the books change and in this case, it's a little deep.It storyline is complex and hard to get to the point. The message it's trying to give you guys is there's no such thing as a human without free will.And if you guys think im corny, i'll give you a easier explanation, K.A. Applegate is writing Animorphs and Everworld at once so she's probably kind of losing her touch. But I don't think so. don't just read, understand, don't flash through and go through it in 10 minutes.Go and take your time to read and ponder and be pensive for a while.So think about what i've said and try to go with it.:)"
2,BORING&POINTLESS!,"I usally love animorphs books, but this is pointless.The whole plot is about a yeerk experment that is a fake! It does not work!!This book is not worth anyone's time!If you want to read animorphs, read a book like #29, The Sickness. That is a very good book.(...)"
3,IT WAS OKAY,The experiment was an okay book.Applegate has wrote other animorph books that were much better. It was confusing and it really didn't have a point.
4,Doll for grandson,I was looking for my grandson a soft doll. Looked at several before finding this one. My grandson really likes the doll. He uses it as a lovey when going to sleep and holds it when taking his bottle. He is 9 months old. Am very pleased with this purchase.
4,Fun Music. Lots of good rhythm,"Would like to see more gentle string selections. Perhaps ""The Palm Court: Music From the Age of Romance and Elegance"" by the London Salon Ensemble. The kind of music played on the ""Real Titanic."""
2,Glass breaks with the slightest touch,"The two frames I recieved (Imperial Frame brand) were 12x18. They seemed nice enough, well made and solid. But after pulling back the little clips and removing the glass, the glass would not go back in. Now I'm not a clumsy hamfisted guy, and I tried carefully as I could to get it in. With barely a push, the glass from the first frame broke in a corner. Not wanting to make the mistake again with the second, I tried ever ever so delicately to push the glass back in. Not only did this one break even easier, but when trying to get the glass out, the shard CUT my poster. So not only am I out the thirty bucks from both frames, but it cut my 20 dollar poster. It has been a long time since I was so frustrated.Maybe others have better luck than I, but I would not recommend buying these frames."
2,Frame is not as pictured,"Be advised that these frames are not as pictured. They do not have the grooves that appear in the photo. Rather, they are a simple rounded black frame with no detailing. They are fine for what I need them for, especially for the price, but others should be aware that the photo does not match what I received."
2,Not worth it,"For the price, the frame really doesn't look any better being solid wood than any cheap plastic frame you can buy at any retail venue. And even with the seller-enclosed directions and diagram, the hanger is a pain to install. I wouldn't buy another."
4,fit perfectly. decent customer service.,frames are great and fit perfectly. my only complaint was that the mounting screws came w/out instructions and having a Y chromosome obviously prevented me from figuring them out. i emailed them but didn't get an answer. however when i called in i got right through to someone who helped me out.
2,Frame Okay Glass Defective,"The frame is okay but the glass in it is poor quality. The glass has wavy patterns resembling dried water spots and scratches. I tried using a glass cleaner to remove them with no luck. I ordered two frames and both had bad glass. Even with a photo in the frame the marks on the glass are very noticeable, especially when light reflects off of them. I wouldn't recommend this brand of frames."
5,Excellent Service,The frames are very nice & well priced. They were excellently packed & arrived in less time then required. I would definitely buy from them again.
5,great frames!,"I've ordered this frame many times, as well as other sizes from my frame store..they have all been awesome! I use them to frame my photography and hang in my home and it's just wonderful."
3,Decent,"This frame is very decent, especially for the price. I have two complaints:1) The fit is less than perfect. The pictures wrinkle a bit - the frame opening is a tiny tiny bit too small. I'm thinking about removing the glass or slightly trimming the prints (1/16-1/8 of an inch should do it).2) The mounting kit included is pretty useless. The frame is too narrow for the included hardware. The wire is too short for horizontal mounts - 1-2 more inches and it'd be OK.I will likely buy them again though."
5,Great Frame,"I bought 2 of the black 16x20 Frames and i'm very happy that I did. The frames are of great quality, and dont look cheap at all, even though the price is quite a steal. I would defiantly recommend these frames and im actually going to be buying a few more in the near future."
3,Good value,"Average quality but well priced. Looks pretty good from far away but imperfections are clear when looking up close. The folding stand, used for placement on a desk instead of wall hanging, seems to weigh unevenly on one side. This makes it hard to center evenly when hanging on the wall. Can't beat the value so I guess I can deal with that."
2,Not the best,"The frame itself seemed fine but the glass was filthy and flimsy. When I tried to clean it and then replace it, the glass broke very easily. I wasn't even able to get the glass clean and I tried everything!"
2,Frosted Glass,"The frame itself is great - nice wood, very simple and classy, but the glass has a film on it that won't go away! It is scratched, and looks dirty. I have washed and dried it several times with plain water (no soap), and it keeps getting worse. I have never encountered this with a glass picture frame before. Sadly, I will have to return it."
1,This Frame is Junk,"I ordered the 8x12 frame for an odd-sized family photo. The first one I received was in great condition - a little cheaply made but it's just going to sit on a shelf so no big deal, right? I ordered a second 8x12 to frame the family photo as a gift and it arrived with cloudy glass and paint chipped off the corners. I sent it back and quickly received a replacement from Amazon. The replacement frame was torn down one side on the back, so when I opened the back to insert the photo, the entire flap just came right off! I'm returning it this time for a refund. What a piece of junk!"
4,Great Company - Great Product,Shop with Confidence at this site. I had exactly what I wanted within 3 days without expedited shipping.
4,Nice frame,"I was looking for a 8x12 frame and they were impossible to find anywhere but online. This one was inexpensive enough that I paid for the frame and shipping for less than I could find the frame anywhere else. It's a nice, sturdy frame, also."
2,Poor quality,"I would not have purchased this item if I could have seen it in person before hand. It is very cheap quality - clasps bend easily, the cardboard backing does not fit properly and it also bends easily. The frame itself was dented and lightly scratched even though it arrived very well packaged in layers of bubble wrap, so the damage must have occured before it was packed."
2,Wouldn't buy again,"I suppose I shouldn't be too critical, because ""you get what you pay for,"" but my frame arrived with a gap at one of the corners, where the wood pieces don't actually come together at the seam. It didn't seem to be a shipping issue as it was packed well, and the glass was intact. I am keeping the frame as I don't really care too much about it (which is why I bought such a cheap frame to begin with!) but it is definitely a noticeable flaw when you walk by the picture. Otherwise the glass and hanging hardware were fine. Would purchase from a different brand next time."
4,"great frame, great price","I thought I'd pay a fortune for this hard to find size, but it was incredibly reasonable. It isn't the best quality, but it's not poor quality either, and unless someone was picking it up and looking at the frame one would never know. Quick shipping too! Would definitely buy from here again."
1,Crummy Frame,The rating for this frame appears to be inaccurate. There are ELEVEN inconvenient tabs that secure the place holder in the frame. These all have to be bent up using a screw driver. The glass is too thin...dangerous to clean. The glass was also quite dirty and hard to clean. The frame is for wall hanging only. No back stand provided.
1,Piece of Crap,This is a cheap and dangerous product. The glass split right down the middle leaving 2 sharp shards of glass just as I was trying to get all the ridiculous cheap metal prongs up to put my picture in. I could have cut myself very badly. After I wrote a previous review (which I now can't find on the website) I received calls and emails from the company wanting to send me a new frame. WHY WOULD I WANT ANOTHER???? So I CAN cut myself this time?? When I didn't respond they sent me another anyway - it sits unopened in the corner. Each time they contacted me they asked that I take my bad review off the site. I find that the most disturbing. Replace a cheap frame with a cheap frame and I'm supposed to be satisfied and not share my safety concerns with others? Don't think so. Don't buy this frame and if you do wear gloves and don't open it on your lap!
1,This thing is a total piece of trash.,"horrible, horrible, horrible. Order a different frame. Don't try to save money, this is frame is garbage. xxxx xxx x"
3,"Difficult size to find, difficult frame to use","Once my picture was in the frame I was happy with this purchase. However, getting to that point was a struggle. This frame was so dirty and dusty, I had to clean it off to even take the backing off. Taking the backing off was especially difficult - there were so many of the small metal black tabs and they were pressed down so far, that even a butter knife repeatedly scratched the backing board when trying to pry them up. Some of them, when bent up damaged the wood material of the frame. No one sees that so it's fine - just annoying to struggle to use something that should be so simple. Because this size frame is so hard to find, it was worth it in the end."
2,JUNK,"One of my frames arrived broken, I did not have time to wrap and return so I took a loss. Luckily the awl-mart in Killeen had 8x12 frames for $2.99 that I purchased for a Bridal show"
3,Flimsy glass,"The product arrived intact and within a reasonable amount of time; however, the glass itself is very flimsy. When I took it out to clean it, it cracked. Not while I was cleaning it, but when I placed it back into the frame it simply cracked and fell apart. This happened several times which is why I returned the items. I don't feel I was rough with the glass, it simply fell apart in my hands. The ones that survived look good; I hope I don't have to take it apart for any reason."
4,Excellent book,"Excellent book. I was looking for a detailed book regarding the various technics/stands etc of TKD. And this book is just what i was looking for.Very detailed, with diagrams for every step/move/either hand or foot and very descriptive on hoew to execute well each technic.I would recommend it with no doubt to everybody who lloks for a books with detailed descriptions for TKD moves."
3,Not enough drawings and pictures that explain the moves.,"The most important thing in marital arts is to understand how to do a proper move. Drawings in this book are black and white, sharp, but too small.Sometimes hard to understand how to do moves.In fact it is not enough pictures and drawings.It should be colored pictures, like in Gracie's Jiu-Jitsu books. But price of this book is not bad, so overall it is good buy. But there are better books.Other thing. Taekwondo is not about belts and forms. It's about kicking and self defense. I don't care much about forms, so I wish to see more actual fighting moves and sparring situations that I can use for self defense."
3,Taekwondo not all the same.,I bought the book for my son just starting out in taekwondo.The book did not match with his class.different forms and styles. I didn't know there are so many ways to teach this sport.Make sure you get the book to match the class.
4,Not a full TKD book,"To be fair, I don't know if Masters of TKD are allowed (or even want) to put everything they know in one book. Maybe they want people to pay for TKD classes. What I DO know is, this book is very helpful. However, there are certain things in the book that is missing.It has all the color forms (belts), but does not have every kick, punch, or other move that you can learn in an actual TKD class.This book is good for beginners. Once you hit green or blue belt, you will only use this book for the rest of the forms, or for a random kick or punch that you should have learned before but didn't...It's a good book, don't get me wrong, but it's just helpful for certain things..."
4,A great book,"This book covered all the aspects of taekwondo as both a martial art and sport. The illustrations were great. The poomse section beautifully explained the WTF forms. My favorite part, though, was the footwork section. My prowess in the ring improved almost immediately after having read it. The authors scattered many helpful tips throughout the book, as well. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in Taekwondo. Well done!"
4,Taekwondo: The State of the Art,"This book offers a comprehensive overview of Taekwondo, from the history and philosophy of TKD to strikes and Poomse. It is the perfect reference for beginners and intermediate students of TKD."
2,not my favorite,"they are smaller than i had thought they would be and the ears make them not really look like pigs, but I probably should have seen that before ordering"
3,Very imaginative...,Mildly interesting but not much real substance. People who are looking for something to grasp onto (whether fact or fiction) may be satisfied with the content but they may be better served by learning to deal with reality.
4,"Peace, Joy and Hope for a Greiving Parent",After losing my 19 year old son to a tragic accident I have had to learn more about death and where we go afterward than I ever wanted to known. Fortunately my son reached out to me in dreams and I was fortunate a friend recommended Mr. Anderson. That experience was more healing than a thousand grief therapy sessions or Compassionate Friends meetings (although I would recommend the later). This book helps explain a lot about life after physical death and will give great hope to those who have lost a loved one. It will also speak to those of all beliefs and even non-believers about what we should strive for in this very short life we live in the flesh. Anyone who is on a spiritual journey or grieving should read this book.
5,Walking in the garden of souls,This book opened other wrolds of thought for me. My husband died and this book helps give me hope of seeing him agian. The book also helped me understand why we are here on this earth and how important it is to work on your path.
3,Just ok.,"Interesting information but I would have preferred more actual stories and less preaching. I geatly preferred ""The Afterlife Unveiled"" as more grounded and informative. I prefer facts and experiences over the author injecting his own feelings into the book."
4,In Other Worlds,I have seen Mr. Anderson in several TV appearancesand always facinated by his down to earth explanationas to why he is able to do what he does. Enjoyedthe book tremendously.
4,A beginners view into the hereafter,"A friend of mine recently had a tragic loss. Someone told me about this book, so I bought it for my friend. She told me she couldn't put it down. She is convinced that her daughter is in a better place and happy. It's worth while to at least look into this theory."
5,Walking in th Garden of the Souls,This book is spell-binding another home run for George Anderson. I would highy recommend this book to anyone. Definitely 5 stars!
4,Not her best but still very fun,"I always look forward to Harrison's stories, and this one, like all her others, was quite entertaining. She has a way of creating all-too-realistic characters, with all-too-realistic foibles. Her tales have more twists and turns in them than one usually finds in 3 such tales, all interwoven in a very clever fashion. Yes, this was another of her books that I had a lot of trouble putting down, so I could get some sleep. It was not her best, but it was still darn good."
1,Yuck,"I am one of those people who generally think you have to finish a book once you start it. In this case, I gave up halfway through. Uninteresting characters and no plot."
1,Don't bother,"I am not entirely sure why Harrison went through the effort of writing this book. There is not much of a plot, the characters are not well developed nor remotely interesting. I'd never want to visit this town. I was past page 100 wondering when the book was really going to get going. It never did. Why I finished it, I'll never know."
5,Circa 99 vulc. Awesome,Excellent service. Receieved the package way before the scheduled date. The shoes are dope. I will definitely order shoes from this company or user again.
2,run small and narrow,I was a bit disappointed with these ones. They run small and narrow. It looks awkward when I wear 'em coz they look really small. It would have been a pretty good lookin' shoe if the size was right
5,Wonderful resource!,Warren Wiersbe always has lots of insightful perspectives on the Bible. I found this book VERY useful in teaching my Sunday School class!
5,Betty Crocker,"I love all brands of Betty Crocker's cookie mix; the double chocolate is usually sold out...thus, why I bought it through this website. I am a chocoholic!"
2,Pre-made not as good,"Betty crocker--or any mixes, for that matter--rate mediocre at best. Personally, I find most betty crocker mixes a bit too sweet for my tastes. In this one, there's a lot of sugar, and there's chocolate too--but the chocolate is not the deep, rich flavor I like when enjoying a decadent chocolate dessert. My advice? Dump the mix and make it from scratch--it's well worth the effort!"
3,The Weatherman LP,"Hot beats, but his flow is near average, his guest stars kills it though. It still a good album."
4,Stellar,"I initially wanted to give this a 4.5. Classic? No. But it's damn close. Give a damn what anyone says. I will say, everyone is entitled to there opinion. But give props where it's due. This album is strong. Lyrically, Production and even track order. It doesn't really have any track that I skip. So, once again, give it a shot. But do be advised, don't jump into this if you haven't listened to Evidence or Dilated prior to this release."
4,The Weatherman LP,"I have heard the best tracks on Hip Hop websites, but aftering buying the album I saw the up and downs in this effort. He comes with interesting flows on most tracks, but some of the beats are not worth mentioning. I also think the hooks could of been better considering who he is known for being with. I think this album is worth the money you will spend, but you must listen to this with an open mind!"
4,Great for your Barney lovers out there,"this is a cute book. My two year old got more than half of the ""ingredients"" right. She loves this book."
1,"""X is for Extra-Sharp Cheddar""...Please!!!","This book has a really cute concept, and is of course appealing because of the ever-friendly Barney. However, ""X is for Extra-Sharp cheddar""? I realize that X is a difficult letter, but if the author was going to do an alphabet book, one would think that it would be incumbent upon said author to create an appropriate food for each letter...or else don't use food as your concept!!! If not creative, at least the book should be correct...it is supposed to be an alphabet learning tool!!!"
3,Cheap parts mar an otherwise good product,"I just receive these stand. Although higher priced than some other stands, it was purchased because it appeared to made of more durable metal parts. This is true of the legs and the stem, giving the unit a very solid feel and solid stance when set up. However, the adapter thread insert is made of cheap plastic and looks like it will break quite easily. Normally, these are made out of brass, which this one should be. Also, there is no tightening knob or handle for the holder, so unless you have a dime or penny in your pocket, you will be out of luck. Overall, then, I feel a good product has been marginalized to save a few pennies."
1,Mic stand,This never came in the mail. I waited and waited but it never showed up. Disappointing as I really needed a mic stand.
3,Does what it does.,"For a desktop microphone stand, it does most of the things I need it to do (being 1. work as a stand 2. stand).The adjustable height mechanism could be improved, as it would keep lowering itself to the minimum height despite me fastening the bottom fasteners unless I rotate it at such an angle, in which it would hold. I replaced the microphone holder with the one that comes with my mic as the one provided doesn't work as well.All in all, an OK product for the price."
1,Where is my product?,I ordered the mic and after waiting several weeks realized that they shipped it to a completely different State. I have sent two requests to the company with NO response. I DO NOT recommend.
4,A window to another era,"I have just finished rereading this book for the first time in over a decade and it has enticed me into ordering a slim book of the poetry of William Carlos Williams. I am not, in general, a great lover of poetry, but he does such an excellent job conveying the exact details of a time and a place, of another era of medicine. Being a doctor myself helps to understand some of the situations, but he writes so specifically that anyone can see what he's trying to say. I like his use of exact, conversational quotes, and his unromantic, but generous view of his, often unhelpful, patients."
4,Insightful,"This is an interesting series of short stories by the great American poet, William Carlos Williams. Williams was actually Dr. Williams and practiced pediatrics for many years. These stories are built around a series of clinical vignettes from medical practice in the early part of the century. While these stories are not great literature, they are very good and Williams is very good at descriptions of clinical phenomena. Some of the clinical entities at the center of the stories are now rarely seen. These stories convey the experience of medical practice in this era very well and several stories have considerable emotional power. This book will be of interest to anyone who likes American literature but will perhaps find the most appreciative audience among physicians."
4,Powerful and Uplifting,"I differ with another reviewer in that I was not bothered by passive voice nor the occasional personal aside. Joel's book gave me an incredibly authentic view of what it is like to live in America with a highly visible disability. His expression of his equal discomfort with the extreme reactions of both pity and hero-worship was very eye-opening. His faith in God is clearly what helped him through his challenges and gave purpose to his life. I began the book thinking that it would have been better had Joel been allowed to die at the scene of the accident. By the middle of the book, I came to see that his life, while having tragic aspects, was not the tragedy that his loss would have been. A fascinating read, but keep a few tissues nearby in the early chapters!"
4,Testimony to Faith and Family,"I met Joel in person at a conference, where he autographed a copy of his book for me. The book is an autobiography of Joel's life so far (he was born in 1977). After hearing him speak, I expeced to read about the powerful role that faith in Christ plays in his and his family's life and he is quite clear about that in the book. What fascinated me more was the role of his parents in his life. They did everything in thier power to make Joel's life a success and to count for something. If it had not been for his family and thier commitment, Joel's life would probably have turned out very different. This book is a testimony to the positive influence of loving and dedicated parents."
5,You will never forget Joel.,"In Joel, you will come as close as you can to seeing life through the eyes of one who has had more asked of him in any single day of his childhood than most of us endure in a lifetime. This is the story of a determined fighter and frankly a roaring success, told with an endearing humility and honesty. Joel can inspire you to look beyond the outward appearance of any disabled person you encounter, to know each is an individual like you in so many ways inside.I was Joel's Orthotist/Prosthetist at Burke when he was about 4 to 5 years old. I have never forgotten what an energetic and normal boy he was, always ready to laugh. Sweet and rambunctious. At that time I read Race For Life, by Joel's lovely mother, a book I still cherish. I never stopped wondering how his story went on after they moved away. Today I couldn't put this book down until I got to the last page. I feel amazed and somehow proud of that little boy all grown up."
3,Still looking for a copy in English,"Ever since my daughter met Joel at a youth conference this summer, we have been seeking a paperback copy in English. I'm sure the book is wonderful, but no one in our household is able to translate Spanish to English, so it may be a while before we get to experience it firsthand.Still looking....."
2,English Words (meanings),"When I was a freshman at De Paul University in 1982, I met a young co-ed, Tricia Chen. We studied this book together to learn about English vocabulary, and how to use these words. We had a brilliant English teacher who taught us about the best way to use a word in a written sentence.I was just a young man who took an ESL class(English AS A Second Language). Now, I think back about the lessons from this book. It takes time to learn the words if you have the time.However, you will improve your standing in the educated community if you learned something more than when you first started to read this book. I was just glad to share this book with that young woman so many years ago.Yes, I still remember Words, Words, Words."
4,"Alright, but missing some things","It is pretty much a good game guide, but i wouldn't recommend it for beginners. It has all the moves, and stuff, but it has hardly any secrets. I don't know about this one...but its a good book for the experienced player."
3,Maybe...medium opus!,"After the bone-crushing'Seventh Sign'Malmsteen and Vescera did one more album together,rehashing the same themes in a more polished manner,but without the urgency of their first effort together.A decent album,but rather predictable."
2,bad CD,"Although he tried to make good songs, this Cd is no good, thanks to singer Mike Vescera. THis singer had worked before with the Japanese band Loudness, and just listen to the aberration he made with them! In ""Magnum Opus""< the songs start wel,, then decline, and decline, and decline..."
4,"Hard read, but worth it","The first 50 pages can be hard to get through, but ones you get into the examples, it is a very interesting change model, using historical figures as examples. Not only do I understand Heifetz's adaptive technique for changing an organization, I also got many mini history lessons."
1,Disappointing Read,"The most disappointing part of this book is its blatant political slant. The book is NOT about a theory of leadership, but about an ideological judgement of the performance of leaders. Heifetz starts by insisting that leadership is necessarily tied to values because if you disagree....then the rest of his book is meaningless. Heifetz believes that to be a good leader you have to adopt positions that he advocates and if you don't, then you aren't a good leader. So, in Heifetz's world, Reagan wasn't a good leader, but LBJ was.Do yourself a favor and keep surfing...."
1,liberal agenda,"does anyone else think Heifetz is pushing a liberal agenda...Every liberal politian/action is praised, and every republican is demonized. What else can we expect from a Harvard professor?"
1,translator,"this product doesn't work on computers with McAfee 8.0 security + windows vista. If you have McAfee security installed on your computer, don't waste your money on the Systran translator."
2,A book on Feng Shui this isn't...,"The subtitle of this book ""Using feng shui..."" is misleading. I returned my copy."
1,Couldn't finish it,"The plot sounded intersting but the dialog and the romance was not even lukewarm.I didn' feel the love and passion. The heroin was described brilliant but if she was, she did not show it. I finally gave up. Nothing really seemed worth the time to finsh it."
2,It must be hard to write a second book,"Because so many sophomore attempts are awful. (Chance book is an example). The first book was very entertaining with a new concept. This book went for the pity me angle -the I'm so tortured with pain, guilt whatever. I tried to like the characters, but the entire conspiracy angle overwhelmed the story. Also are the others friend's or foes. Make up your mind please. Over all I would borrow but not buy full price."
4,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"I enjoyed the first in the series, Dark Protector, and was looking forward to Blake's story. Blake is a Paladin and watches the border between our world and the Others. Paladin's are born warriors and often die in the line of duty, but are continuously brought back by their Handlers. Once a Paladin has been brought back one time too many, he becomes an Other and must be put down. In the First book, Blake was very close to becoming an Other. I had the feeling he was on the edge of losing his humanity. I did not get that feeling in this book, even though it kept saying he was close to having to be killed. I just expected more of his character and felt somewhat dissapointed. I didn't care too much for Brenna either. Dr. Laurel Young and Devin Blane's characters were more fleshed out in the first book. I still enjoyed the story but I wouldn't give it 5 stars. It kept my interest for the most part, but just didn't carry me away."
4,Awesome!,"On the one hand, I really think Paranormal Romances are in a rut. The plotlines are really all staring to be the same: Immortal guy meets girl who saves him from becoming ""Other"".Still, I like this series. I tore through this book in just a few days (would have been shorter if I hadn't been so busy with other stuff). I recommend it highly."
4,A fun read!,"What an imaginative story line Ms. Morgan has created! She grabs your attention and then you hang on for the great ride to the end. The barrier divides good and evil, or does it? Can't wait for the 3rd book!"
1,Great show - bad item,"I'm a huge Moonlighting fan, so of course I love the show itself. I just wish I'd opened the package as soon as I got it. When I took off the cellophane packaging, the cd's inside were all completely scratched up. So my advice is to inspect your item as soon as you get it and make sure to keep the receipt!"
4,Taking me back,"I so loved this series when it was on tv. While watching all 5 seasons, that I couldn't wait for the next one to go on sale and get into my home, it reminded me how tv could be enjoyed by all family members without worrying that something inappropriate would appear on screen. In this day most people don't realize how funny Bruce Willis is. I laughed alot. The storylines are predictable and a little bit corny. But whats so wrong with that?!"
1,Moonlighting final season,"This season was poorly written and the acting was awful, don't waste your money on it!"
3,Should have stopped sooner.,"They should have stopped the show after two and a half seasons. The fifth year was getting better right before the last show. I like year five more than years three and four, the old jokes were coming back from the first year."
4,All good things must come to an end,My wife and I followed the series from the beginning to end. As in many series of this type their lives are built around the job. Romance is always questionable at times and that makes the series all the more interesting. Frustration is always part of the game that is played between them selves and their clients. It helps keep a form of friendly competition growing within the series.Bruce Welch
5,"season five , the final season","I liked this season, maddie was toned down in this season . I don't think she slammed one door. but I enjoyed it .True fans will love it ."
5,Moonlighting Season Five,The final chapter in the love-hate relationship between David and Mattie with some poignant twists as they each move on in their lives. Great commentary from the producers and cast. Quick fresh wit and comedy.
2,They just couldn't recover,This season of Moonlighting was slightly better than season four but the writers tryed to patch up the relations ship between the characters in a haphazard way and the story line never recovered from season four. AS a result the show was cut short and so you only get 13 episodes instead of 22. In my opinion it should be a lot less expensive since you don't get as much.
1,WORST CD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT,"I got this cd like a week ago , i thought it was a interview with nsync and its NOT . Its just a person telling you there life story how they started etc . I Dont recommend this at all"
4,A book that helped with lab management,This book really helped us to get things straight when we were trying work out how to manage a lab of computers that were all different versions of windows and all served by an NT server. I recommend this book to people that need help with setting up logins from any type of windows machine into an NT server
5,EXCELLENT!,I am a technical trainer and have started recommending this book to all of my students. This slim volume helps solve many of day-to-day NT problems and includes a great amount of very useful information. This book has some of the best information I have seen to date reguarding the integration of Windows 95 and 98 clients into NT networks. The author consentrates on useful real world information.I only wish this book had appeared earlier in NT 4's life. I hope the author has started the Windows 200 version of the book
1,I expected more..,"Having lived in Texas when Kinky ran for Governor, I was expecting biting, raucous humor. But, sad to say, I was disappointed... Seemed like more of an effort to make a little money off his ""fame"" than a serious attempt at humor.. I read through the whole thing - but it was a struggle to keep from just tossing it in the throw away pile.. What a waste of time.."
2,Bad signal,I've installed several radios and this adapter just has a awful signal. Radio stations only come in some of the time.
3,Amazing,It is so weird to watch this doll sing and being that you can plug your MP3 players into it and she's sing's your songs. My daughter just loved it.
4,Great Dug-out Help,"The bat rack has been a huge help organizing our dug-out. We have a team of 12 nine year old boys and during the game, bats were everywhere. The best part, is that this item holds Big Barrel bats. We play Pony and Travel baseball and all of the bats fit nicely."
4,Works Well,one of the few I found that holds more than 10 bats. Great for tournament play as we can simply roll the bats up and carry it from dugout to dugout.
2,Hard to follow,"I had to read this book for school when we studied Japanese internment. And I can't say I loved it. The paragraphs were written in haikus, or something, and it took me two chapters to figure out who the main character was and if it was a boy or a girl. All in all, it wasn't a bad book about Japanese Internment in Canada, but I wouldn't read it over again if I could avoid it. ""Shichan"", the main character, was kind of blah, too. I think she should have spent mroe time thinking about her feelings and thoughts than talking about snow. It wasn't too long, though, which was pretty good."
4,It really opened the mind,"Well, I liked the book. My partner bought it into me when I was in hospital for a couple of days and I found it to be absorbing and it kept my mind off the things that were going on around me. Trefil really made a great job of putting into plain simple language some very difficult concepts and ideas. A snapshot of science today, and it will be interesting to see in 10 years how much the list he has chosen has changed."
5,Technical but fascinating,"Someone gave this book to me as a gift. I like the way it is organized into sections according to sub-categories in science, such as biology, physics, medicine, etc... Some sections are quite technical and take effort to envision, but other sections offer a great view much more complicated subjects like quantum mechanics. This book makes a great gift."
3,An interesting collection of ideas.,"The book is a well written collection of 101 chapters, more of a reference book than a good read. Will go out of date relatively quickly. The things chosen make sense and each is well explained."
4,My Razr V3,I received my unlocked razr v3 here in Baghdad and right out of the box it was great. I am not pleased at all with the hands free. The volume from the ear piece is not the quality I have come to expect from original accessories. The sound of the mic according to my wife is distant. Again not the quality of an original in my opinion. I have browsed the inside of the phone. I am a long time motorolla user so it was very familiar. I have a plantronics bluetooth in the US and when I get home I will try it with the phone.Merry Christmas and Happy New Year from Baghdad!
1,RAZR V3 International Version,"From day one these phones were a problem. They were listed as new but when I turn them on there were a history of use. I informed the seller and they were willing for me to return them but I decided to just accept a free leather case being that they looked new. BIG MISTAKE! Within 3 months I had to purchase 2 new phones. Problems include dead LCD, batteries not holding charge, phone turning off in the middle of calls and the list goes on."
2,the sound is pour for a $100 phone,"the sound is pour for a $100 phone,like many of the cheap go phone,well not that bad.the sony ericson z310 is a much better buy.and its a cingular go phone only $50"
2,PIECE OF GARBAGE,"This phone is junk. The design stinks. Buttons are too small. The back cover keeps falling off and won't secure tightly. Can't upload ringtones from a third party. Every now and then, you'll be dialing and certain number keys don't work. Then you try again and other number keys don't work. You reboot the phone and it's still screwy. Only after turning it off for ten minutes was able to get it working correctly. Good thing I wasn't trying to dial 911.Then a week later it's deja vu all over again. Not just one phone. Both mine and my ol' lady's phone too.Junk. Garbage. Cr*p."
1,do not buy this phone,"do not buy this phone, it is defective and does not work. it will not charge the battery at all, i spent extra money thinking it was just a defective battery when in reality it was the phone itself that was defective. dont waste your time or money on this phone save yourself some grief!Motorola RAZR V3i Unlocked Phone with Camera, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with No Warranty (Silver/Gray)"
2,Motorola RAZR V3 (silver),"We purchased two Motorola RAZR V3's almost 2 months ago. The battery life on both is about 1 day if you do NOT use it and about 15 minutes if you do. I've lost a few calls and I have to continuously charge both to be able to get a call in. I realize I purchased without warranty, realizing this is an older phone, but would not recommend anyone buying them. I ended up moving my SIM card to another phone altogether. The other phone is being used, but away from a charger, I worry about losing calls. I love the look and feel of the RAZR, but the value should lie in whether it works well or not, and it doesn't."
2,Disapointing,I ordered a new cell phone and when it arrived it seemed it was put together in pieces. The back battery cover is sprained and the flip hinge shows signs of rust and makes a noise. In addition the body is scratched with one chip on the front casing. The plastic battery bag was unsealed.
1,sorry excuse for a razr,"worst cell phone i have ever purchased kept losing calls had hard time getting text messages from others.i had 2 razrs before they were great phones but thisone is a piece of crap.hadn t had a month and i ve already ordered a new phone,not a razr"
2,Not what I expected,"This purchase was to replace a Razor that completely went black after 9 months. Because I had all of the accessories for the Razor, I purchased another. Half of my information did not transfer to the new phone. This new Razor is an unlocked phone and obviously from a different service provider. It is totally different than the previous phone and I am unable to connect to the Internet or receive picture emails. Just pay full price for a phone with your provider..."
1,Dissapointed!!,"First the cell phone was used and not brand new. The display screen came off at the time and the body of the cell phone was all scratched up. When I contacted DataVision and complained (they make you hold like 20 minutes before you are able to speak to any representative), they apologised and basically told me to buy a new one and the best they could do was to send it for free while sending the previous one back. I had to gift this one to a family member just before christmass and therefore I had no option but to go ahead with their offer. However the return postage on the return item was paid by me and I have not been reimbursed the money yet for the return item even after nearly a month has passed. I will not buy anything from Datavision from now on."
2,Compatable Brother LC51 Ink,The quality of this product is incredibly poor! I would not purchase this again at any price.
3,It works,"The product works as I expected, the color is not vivid as one printed with the maufactured ink, the trade off is it's only one third of the brand name price."
2,Trailer was effective,"It's a cute movie, but very slow. I watched the trailer and thought it would be interesting but I was sadly mistaken. The story line is realistic, but its almost like the characters the main interacts with are slightly incomplete. You're able to fill in the blanks about who they are in relation to the main, but it leaves you wanting more."
3,Too Slow,the movie really was about someone reminising. I like movies with more of a mysterious plot. This movie was boring.
3,I felt like the story didnt connect...acting was good,"The plot was missing something but the acting was pretty good, Salli Richardson-Whitfield did her thing.... as usual and the other cast were decent as well."
2,I guess,"It was a well put together movie, but I hated how it ended and it didn't give me the cinderella finish I love. I guess I may just be melodramatic about this but the heart wants what the heart wants. It was alright, not spectacular but nor terrible. Lets just say I flicked the TV off when it was over because I was unhappy with the end result. FYI the cover is a liar"
2,SLOW AS HELL,I REALLY HAD A HARD TIME FOLLOWING THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT WAS SO SLOW AND BORING. THE MAIN CHARACTER'S AUNT HAD DIED AND THEY HAD BEEN REALLY CLOSE. SO THE MOVIE IS BASICALLY ABOUT HER THINKING ABOUT OLD DAYS AS SHE CLEANED OUT HER AUNTS HOUSE. IN THE MIDST OF HER PACKING UP THINGS HER AUNTS DAUGHTER COMES THROUGH AND SPEAKS HER MIND ABOUT HOW SHE FELT ABOUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND THE MAIN CHARACTER'S EX BOYFRIEND SHOWS UP ALSO. I WOULD SAVE MY MONEY...THAT IS TEN THAT COULD GO ON GAS...
1,One of the Worse,"I try to support black movies , and actors, actress, but I cannot believe that this was a movie, there was no beginning , no middle and a very strange ending that made even less sense than the movie itself, I can safely say I hated it."
3,subtle and complex.,Recommended highly. Seems to drag at first but then the relationships with the different characters flesh out. The kind of movie that stays with you.
3,I WILL FOLLOW,"well, it mostly starred Sally Richardson, so I wasn't too excited since I originally ordered because of Omari who had a short part BUT full of emotion and passion so I give it 3 stars. very long before it even shows Omari Hardwick wasn't happy."
4,Splendid read,"I read this book in three days straight, could not concentrate on anything else. Especially since I am born Dutch, grew up in Portugal and lived in Goa for a while, this is the book that I've been waiting for all my life. Can barely wait for the follow up. Adventure, History, passion, love and murder, what else does a reader want. Bravo!, Nicolette"
1,Not quite there,"I did not like this book. While the historical content is fascinating, the characters are fairly contrived and the plot is, well, very bollywood masala. (predictable and disappointing). I did not like the writing either. The writing lacks subtlety and is parts is way to graphic, bordering on the vulgar. the writing is stilted in places and lacked a certain sophistication that I'm used to seeing in other historical fiction (examples: Indu sundaresan, Amitav ghosh). I could not relate to ANY of the characters: they remain flat and rather unbelievable and highly unsavoury.The writer is ostensibly a historian and a ""student of india"". yet, there are jarring inaccuracies, such as the use of the phrase ""ishvar-allah"" for God willing. What he means is ""inshah-allah"". I was also irritated by the use of ""hindi"" (the language) instead of ""hindu"" to refer to the local non-muslim Indians.Overall I would not recommend it- at all."
5,Dazzling Tale of a Distant Time and Place,"This novel is beautifully-written, rich with sensuous narrative and vivid characters. It brings to life one corner of India's vast history, and the interractions of the rulers and the ruled, native and foreign. You will cheer on the protagonists and the lovers, and draw dark satisfaction from the justice visited upon the evil. Don't miss this book!"
2,OK to borrow. Not worth buying.,"I borrowed this book from the library. Good I did not invest in owning it. Some characters and events sound juvenile - this from a layperson's point of view... I am not a historian...There is SO much about eunuchs, (as much if not more than content about the temple dancer herself) the book might as well be called something else.Just a pet-peeve, how Indian, esp Hindi words were contorted to English - e.g., ""Ishvar-Allah"" (Ishvar indicates the Hindu God of Destruction, Shiva) for ""God Willing"". The actual phrase is closer to Insha'allah. And one would think an ""Indian history buff"" would know a tad more than this!"
1,A Waste of Time,I found this book a bit insulting in its unbelieveable set of characters and their predicaments. A waste of time and money.
3,A Fairytale with Unsavory Characters,"Not bad...Interesting cast of characters, the men being extrememly grotesque and cruel and the women beautiful and weak at times. You have Maya, a brainwashed temple dancer that honestly believes that opening her body to men is serving her god. Lucinda is a pampered Portuguese girl that is all about dresses and corsets and the woman she is in the end is amazing and I enjoyed reading her change. Geraldo, Victorio, and Slipper (and about 20 other fellows) are the most disgusting, vile men I have ever read about. There is an immense amount of cruelty, greed, and hate and a hint of homosexuality here and there. The women alone, and the way they grew and blossomed and grew stronger on this amazing journey amongst the perversion made the book worthwhile. To sum it up, the book is about men and how their greed controls them and the deeds and bad deals they make to advance themselves. The women are simply caught in the middle of it."
5,"Witty, Intelligent, Transforming","Fiffer has spent time reflecting on his life and it is obvious when reading this book that it was time well spent. His observing eye is keen and his narrative is clean and well-written. What I loved about this book on top of coming to know Fiffer as the courageous and honest individual he is, was its HUMOR. One of my favorite characters in this memoir was the trainer who called him Crip and who lived at home with his dominating mother where he ate Cool Whip, the universal health food. This is a memoir to learn from yes but the best way to learn is to ENJOY the process and that is what Fiffer makes possible through his prose. I read this book through in one wonderful day. I recommend it to everyone."
1,What uninspiring arrogance!,"After reading published reviews of this book, I had high hopes, but found them dashed as Fiffer revealed his outrageous self-serving arrogance. I almost threw the book away several times, but persevered, assuming (incorrectly) that he'd eventually learn some lessons. Optimistic me.... One of Fiffer's friends in the book refers to his ""healthy perspective."" I think not! He takes such advantage of people, especially those who try to help him. I felt so sorry for his parents, particularly. It's a tribute to their love that they stuck with him. Does Fiffer ever think about anyone besides himself? Ask such characters as Dave Scott, or Sandy, or the nurse Miss Boland, whose treatment by her patient can only be described as sexual harassment of the worst sort. Far more inspiring books are Tim Hansel's ""You Gotta Keep Dancin'"" or Joni Eareckson Tada's autobiography. As for this one, too bad you don't have a 0-star option."
1,Most Stupid!,This is probably the worst product listing on Amazon. The item is Goodyear! Goodyear what? Fuel hose? What size? How long? There is absolutely no information on this 'product'. The 'specifications' list the brand - Goodyear. Do we need to do a Google search to determine what goodyear is selling? Note also that the fuel injection hose 'may be easily removed when not in use'! Really dumb.
3,Hope this helps the hopeless item description,"Go to the Goodyearep website and search for ""Fuel Injection Hose SAE 30R9."" There you will find the following table which lists the part numbers for the various interior diameter hoses and their various lengths which will enable you to determine what particular hose is being sold on Amazon:Part Number ID (in) OD (in) Lengths (ft) Working Pressure (PSI) Burst Pressure (PSI) Min Bend Radius(in) Vacuum HG(in) Weight (lb/ft)65148 1/4 .50 1.5 max 100 900 0.75 24 0.1065151 1/4 .50 25 max 100 900 0.75 24 0.1065301 1/4 .50 250 max 100 900 0.84 24 0.1065149 5/16 .56 1.5 max 100 900 0.84 24 0.1265152 5/16 .56 25 max 100 900 0.94 24 0.1265302 5/16 .56 250 max 100 900 0.94 24 0.1265150 3/8 .63 1.5 max 100 900 0.94 24 0.1465153 3/8 .63 25 max 100 900 0.94 24 0.1465303 3/8 .63 250 max 100 900 0.94 24 0.1465164 1/2 .80 50 max 100 900 2.00 24 0.16"
1,WTF,WHAT ARE YOU SELLING??????I don't know WTF I can say that the other two reviews haven't already.I might need this but I will never know.
1,worst posting,"What size hose, ID, OD, length? This posting with no information is completely useless. Can't even consider product, insufficient product details."
2,Slow and Fragmented,"This movie had a hard time keeping my attention. It's not so bad when it comes to low-budget horror but it had it's fair share of problems. It's paced too slow which makes it boring most of the way through. Too many of the story pieces felt like they were just thrown in ""just because"" to me as well. It's pretty anti-climactic too. The only thing that redeems this film in any respect is the 'classic' ghost story elements. Rent it and make up your own mind but I wouldn't suggest buying this one."
3,A good tv movie type thriller,"But don't expect more. There aren't any real thrills like there could have been, but if you like tv movies, this might be up your alley.The ending is a little strained like it was a rush job. A few strings were left untied, but it just seems like they forgot to tie them, not like they were hoping for a part 2."
3,Good little thriller,"While most of the reviews for this movie here are negative, I think some people just put down movies because the internet allows them freedom to be a ""critic"". That aside, I like this movie and watched it twice, plus recorded it to DVD-R. It's an interesting ghost story, I don't care what the naysayers here write about it. Recommended for horror/suspense fans and you can catch it on Fearnet."
2,A Choppy Chop film,"This movie felt very much like an armature investment, the problem is the Screen writer! lol, the actors lines are not fully developed, the story jumps in time, and never fill in the Choppy parts,"" when Elizabeth, or her other name, meets the News reporter who was killed 30 yrs ago, they meet his doing a story, on malpractice, suddenly "" Chop!"" they are talking about apparitions. just one issue. It could have worked as there are good moments and some very good actors strewn in an through the story line. The hilarious dialogue of the Killer. Brilliant."
3,Stay Out Of Vacant Houses!...,"A TV news reporter (Alexandra Holden from WISHCRAFT) witnesses her boyfriend's brutal murder. Afterward, she takes time off to return to her hometown, and moves back in w/ her mum and dad (played by Leslie Easterbrook and Sid Haig from THE DEVIL'S REJECTS!!). Rather than getting a nice, long rest, she finds herself involved in a dark mystery involving a mass murderer, ghosts, and a family secret. Ms. Holden is quite good in her role, as are the (very restrained) Easterbrook and Haig. Another DEVIL'S REJECTS alum (Bill Mosely) plays the sheriff! While far from being a masterwork, A DEAD CALLING is certainly worth a look..."
2,A DEAD MOVIE,"A DEAD CALLING is another of those low budget throwaways that you'll feel compelled to finish watching just because of the time you invest in it. Alexandra Holden sheepishly portrays a young tv journalist who suffers a breakdown when a stalker kills her fiancee. She returns to her hometown and joins the local small tv station where she finds herself embroiled in the mass murder of a family by their physician father/husband. There's hints of more than just journalistic involvement, however, when Holden makes a shocking discovery.The movie suffers from a predictable and implausible script, and mediocre acting...the father is particularly laughable. For true lovers of the genre only."
3,"Strange and interesting, but not Brilliant","The Birdwatcher is a pretty interesting band, and their album ""The Darkest Hour is Before the Dawn"" is at times pretty enjoyable to listen to, especially for people who are interested in more heavily instrumental music. But there's a lack of continuity and progression that exists throughout the whole album that makes listening to it very boring at times. Also, though the musicians do experiment very heavily with different instruments and tones, there is an obvious lack of ability. Repeating 3 chords over and over for 4 minutes is not brilliant."
4,a good comparative perspective,"Because of Kunstler's certainty that the age of cheap oil may doom our auto-dependent cities, his opinions of American Sunbelt cities are perhaps a bit more pessimistic than my own -- and if this book was limited to Atlanta and Las Vegas, I would be more sympathetic to the views of the negative reviewers.But what makes this book worth reading is his discussion of European cities (especially Paris). Learning about other countries' policies gave me a bit more of a feel for what works and what doesn't. For example, by discussing Paris's use of street trees and smaller parks, Kunstler shows how not every park has to look as wild and ""natural"" as Central Park. And by explaining Roman classicism, he explains why classically styled buildings are more attractive (at least to him, and frankly to me as well) than modern glass boxes."
2,Stick to commentary on the urban condition...,"While Kunstler in the past has accurately described the current dilemma of the space in which we live, particularly in the Geography of Nowhere and Home from Nowhere, his focus is much less acute in this text. Take his chapter on London--instead of his usual critical eye discussing the landscape of London, we get a rehashed lesson in history and countless digressions in reference to other cities topped off with a remark about homosexuals in a park. Most annoying however, is his increasing penchant for attacking individuals rather than problems (note his inexcuseable comments about a woman who has just lost her husband in his chapter on Atlanta). His anger may keep him vigilant on the subject of suburban sprawl, but it often times detracts from the reader empathizing with the position he puts forward."
2,Socialistic Eurotrash,This book is nothing but Socialistic Eurotrash. Don't even bother. I give it a 2 to get my opinion published.
3,"Disappointing content, nice pics","Okay. It's a book with naked women. Some of the pictures are nicely arranged, but most are just the usual vanilla pornography -- and I still don't quite get why it is that the bondage theme is so universally considered erotic. Seems like fully 25% of the pics in this book are devoted to bondage or lesbian bondage. I'd much rather just see nice bodies in interesting poses. [...]"
2,erotic disappointment,"Some photographers think what's erotic is what's hidden and left to the imagination. Two Thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing, leaving plenty to the imagination. Think of playboy magazine in the 1950's or Vogue or Madamoselle magazine today. Many of these are stylistic, but not very erotic. One in three of the photos in the book are erotic, not afraid of nudity. Don't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism. Instead get ""Shaven Angels"", ""Natural Beauties"", ""100 Naked Girls"", or ""Crazy,Sexy Girls""."
5,All things bright and beautiful...,"All creatures great and small, all things wise and wonderful, the Lord God made them all... This is a great hymn, one of my favorites (especially the arrangement by John Rutter). Reading (singing!) this book to my children has given them an appreciation for the beauty in God's world. The illustrations are the kind that a child is drawn into - the kind they can gaze at and imagine themselves in the scene.A carefree country girl goes on a ramble as the hymn unfolds. My children (me too!) want to kick off their shoes and share in the child's absorption of the beauty around her.Great way to children-ize a hymn."
4,"Quartet In and Out Sign, 14 x 10 Inches, Black (8133-1)",Nicer than expected little board. Looks neat and a bit more professional than dry erase board. I would definitely purchase again. One draw back on the one I got; some of the letters that you use for the names seem too loose on the slots. Also would be nice if the board was a little bigger.
2,Not The Best,"I got this cd as one of my Xmas presents which were mostly WWF, Pamela Anderson & Xtina stuff and this wasn't as good as it is described on the back of the pkg. Its a set of 1 cd, 1 cd-rom & 1 book. The cd DOES NOT CONTAIN MUSIC OR INTERVIEWS. It only has a woman with a crummy accent saying things in a non-emotional way. Here is the real track listing: 1. Bio, 2. Sing-along-with the weirdo (not to be confuesd w/karaoke) 3. Answer the weirdos questions although shes not there 4. Another sing-along with the weirdo, I found this cd offensive. I'm not psycho so why would I want it? The cd-rom which contains ""games, links & trivia"" is no better except for the fact that it has a few pics. The trivia isn't an actual trivia & this has no actual games! The book is very colorful & descriptive as well as the cd-case so get it to get it & for the book I guess."
5,"Good product, but no instructions or parts list","Very good product, but they are wasting money by including so many extra parts and wasting my time with no instructions and nothing telling you what is in the box."
1,spend a little more money...,"In a word, these are ""junk"" stands. I bought two and the hardware supplied was either incomplete or mis-manufactured to the point it was unusable. I substituted my own (much nicer) hardware and got them assembled, but I would never trust them with anything heavier than about 25 pounds. The idea of using (a very cheap) 6mm bolt to support the entire weight of the speaker is laughable and the overall quality of the stand could be surpassed by a first year metal shop student. If anyone actually used these in a studio (which I doubt), it would only be long enough to buy new stands and get these sold on ebay. I blame myself since I was suckered in by the low price, but these are not suitable for any professional use. Save your money and buy a real stand from a real manufacturer."
4,Studio Monitor Stands For The Modest Engineer,"stand is good quality, I ordered one to try it out, ended up buying the second one... Only complaint is the the instruction manual... it lacks lest say... instructions... there's a picture but it's too blurry and dark, you kind of have to take a stab at the dark with it, I ended up with extra peaces... ya I know extra pieces... all and all it's a good stand for the price, sturdy and you can put casters on it."
3,Solid stand...if only it came with all the parts,"These stands would be great if they came with all the correct pieces in the box. Add in vague directions and the result is mediocre at best. The seller on amazon has been very helpful, however, the actual manufacturer, Quicklok, has done nothing to resolve the situation of the missing parts. A good price and if you're willing to take the gamble of what might show up in the box, I'd say go for it. Otherwise, shell out a couple more bucks and buy a set from a more reputable manufacturer."
1,Buy something else.,Poor quality. Tapping of post did not match up with threads on bolt. Could not put together. Get something else for your speakers.
4,Good stand. Useless wiring clips,"I bought two of these to hold my Adam A7X studio monitors. The stands are made of solid material. The triangle footing definitely helps in the constrained space of my small studio. They are more prone to tipping than a square base would be, but unless you place them where people might bump in to them, the likelihood that they tip is minimal. The accessories are the only negative for this stand. The wire clips broke just trying to insert them. I don't know how they were supposed to work, but trying to insert them in to the holes as described didn't work at all. The clip looked like it was supposed to be pushed in and put through the hole, but the plastic just broke instead of bending. The other draw back is the instructions. They are definitely not very helpful. I got through the assembly pretty easily though, even though I was a little worried at the start from seeing the instructions and pieces. It's pretty straight forward. Overall, I'd recommend these stands."
3,I would not purchase again,There is only one reason I would not make this purchase again. There is one screw with knob on it to tighten or losen. This screw is what holds the stand either higher or lower per your adjustment. It is poor quality screw and you can't find the holes to adjust easily.The entire stand itself is heavy duty and great quality! I drilled mine out and use a metal rod in those holes to adjust much easier and stronger. If you look at the pic of the product I am talking about the adjuster found mid-height on the pole. As long as your handyand willing to put a little time into it. Not a bad buy. As is though... junk hardware.
4,"Does the job, but no directions to assemble","I've always been a fan of Quiklok merchandise, but when this item came with a bunch of random pieces without instructions, it was frustrating to say the least. After about 10-15 minutes it was assembled and does the job with my HS80M Yamaha speakers. I'm satisfied. I guess I'm curious why there's no directions with the product. I bought two and think the price was very reasonable. What a difference to have the speakers level with your ears as opposed to on the floor."
1,Not Recommended,"We thought we were buying a video with nothing but trains. Turns out it's mostly an informational DVD with some kid narrating almost all the way through it. My two-year-old wines everytime the kid comes on. If you're looking for something for older children so that they can learn about trains, this video is fine. But, if you are looking for just train video, let this one roll down the track."
3,rigorous history,"This is not a cute recounting of Sacajawea and her French husband. This is not Pocahontas and John Smith with a Parisian accent. You can tell that the author is a historian's historian. She is writing for an audience of scholars on Native Americans. She looks at four examples taking place in the Midwest during the 1700s and 1800s to talk of how intermarriage and miscegenation played a role in European exploration, domination, and trade. You have to be well-versed in Native American studies and Midwestern history in order to understand this text. I hope the author gets tenure because this was a truly erudite text. Unsophisticated readers, be warned!"
4,Must for anyone interested in the fur trade,"The title of the book is a little misleading, because what you really get is a history of the fur trade in the southern Great Lakes: Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana. It also does a great job demonstrating how kin relations, both literal and fictive, created communities and networks that allowed the fur trade to thrive. If you know anything about how the fur trade in Canada operates, this book is a must have, as the fur trade in the southern Great Lakes was drastically different, as Sleeper-Smith demonstrates. In a large part this was due to the role of women, as is demonstrated in the book."
5,A+,"I'm not sure if it smells much like morning rain, but it smells great! It dissipates in about 2 minutes at the very most and leaves my carpet smelling and feeling awesome."
5,silence de lo mejor,"es el uno de los mejores cd's de gigi que ha sacado en toda su carrera, podemos ver lo maduro que es y lo demuestra con estas canciones, les aseguro que se enamoraran de el"
3,The Man in the Santa Claus Suit,"With all the junk that gets re-released on DVD, it is a mystery that ""The Man in the Santa Claus Suit"" has never reappeared in this convenient medium. After all, the industry went to a lot of trouble to sell us on the new and easy disk format, and it certainly is better than the clunky old tape cassettes. So follow up!Somebody, somewhere, who has the rights to this excellent film can create a win-win situation by bringing it out in a good, clean DVD. It will sell well -- as the responses to the Amazon listing clearly indicate -- and make a buck for the folks who own the property.What's keeping this from happening?????????????????Merry Christmas, Mister Scrooge."
5,Soothing music for the soul,"I was surprised to find no reviews of this very fine collection of clarinet works. I've owned the LP version for many years, and have come back to this music again and again. Janet Hilton's clarinet playing is superb. The Vaughn Williams pieces are real gems. This is very soothing music for the soul. It's a good album to listen to after a long and tiring day at the office."
4,My dogs love it!,"I have two 7 month old puppies. They love these. The only problem is the puppies are chewing bits off the toy. I think they need a stronger, more durable type of toy. One puppy loves trying to figure out how to get the treats out. The other one wishes the treats weren't in there, but works on getting them out also."
1,Fun While It Lasted,I have a 6lb. Maltichion and he destroyed this toy... I was shocked when I picked it up and he had chewed a big chunk out of it. Definatley not the toy for a chewing dog....he had a ton of fun with it while it lasted but now its in the trash. I really like the Premier line of toys but this fell under my expectations.
1,Good concept bad design,"The twist-n-treat looked promising with thick rubberized plastic much like a a kong, but our border collie/australian shepard mix chewed off portions of this toy within minutes of getting all the treats out (which took about 15 seconds, even when twisted down to a very small slit). Luckily she is prone to spitting pieces like this out."
2,Small pieces of plastic falling out.,"Our dog loves this toy, but before she learned to play with it properly she chewed off small plastic pieces out of the toy within the first hour. The plastic is too hard and not pliable. We wish we had bought a Kong product instead because they are generally more flexible and don't break off. This toy should only be used under supervision."
2,Lasted 10 mins,"I'm sure that for ""non-chewer"" dogs this is fine...if dogs like that exist. This lasted about 10 mins before chunks of it were being bitten off. If you have a large dog or a chewer of any strength, go for the Kong stuff...they aren't perfect but they are the toughest I have found."
3,Premier treat dispenser,"I try to buy small treat dispensers for my maltese to keep them entertained when they start sparring (as my husband calls it). I also have to deal with a chewer, so try to buy toys for hard chewers. This is not one of my favorite toys, although I love the Premier brand. My 15 lb. maltese had this toy for approximately 15 minutes when all the treats were gone and he had already sort of bent one side of it from chewing. Also found that when I screwed the two pieces together to match up the release point, it was either too small or too large for the treats I used. Try the Premier waggle or busy buddy."
3,Too Much to Little,"The concept is neat, but I couldn't adjust the toy to let the treats out correctly. Either nothing came out or all the treats came out at once. I have other treat and food dispencing toys that are more user friendly."
3,"great toy, but not good for bully dogs","i think this would be a great toy for most dogs, but not mine! it is a great tool for mental stimulation, but our 1 yr old pitbull mix had a chunk eaten out of it in less than 5 minutes. so, i you have a strong jawed dog, this probably isn't for you."
2,Not a hit,"I'm sure there are dogs out there who love this, mine did not, no one has ever touched it in the entire year++ we've owned it, to be honest I even tried putting kong stuffing in it and the dogs still weren't interested, I think I tossed it!"
1,Horrible smell,"I bought two and threw them away after a month. They had a horrible chemical smell that no amount of washing and air drying would remove. Not sure where they are made, but not worth the risk."
5,Great to keep them busy for a bit,"My aussie likes her treats but gulps them down anticipating the next one. This toy slows her down a bit and keeps her occupied. I usually only put in a couple of small treats and the rest is her dry dog food. It takes her a while to manipulate the toy to ensure she gets every morsel. It can be a bit messy if your dog salivates a lot, but the dog really seems to enjoy it, so well worth the periodic clean up. Btw, I have the large size for our aussie and the small one for our pomeranian. She is still a puppy and even the small one is a bit too big for her at the moment."
2,"great idea, poor design","other products are better for the same purpose. keep looking. this toy was hard to load. the screw never quit fit into the other side so it was hard to open, close, and adjust so treats wouldn't just fall right out. ultimately it broke (see pic). save your money and go for one of the other treat dispensers"
1,Chew Toy?,"My 13 pound Havanese spent about an hour getting food out, with varying success. Then it became a chew toy. Also, it's only about 3 or 4"" diameter - much smaller than I imagined."
3,Keeps the dog busy,It keeps the dog busy but is not really durable. My yorkie chewed it up in less than one hour. This way it comes out really expensive.
4,Good fun for owners and dogs,"My 7 year old, 9 pound chihuahua loves this toy. He eats way to fast and I got this to help him have fun and eat his dry food slower. He figured it out pretty quickly, but isn't bored with it. It's pretty entertaining to watch him roll it around and get the food. One piece drops out and he eats it then resumes rolling the toy. It seems sturdy enough to last a long time and easy to clean. The down side is the food compartment is very small; it holds 1/4 cup of dry food at the very most."
3,Nice toy,My dog likes it. Very stimulating and it make him work hard for his treats! I usually put small pieces of carrots and apples and he can play with it for a while. However one major drawback that the toy gets easily stuck underneath couches or tables and sometimes it's hard to find!
2,Not impressed,"I didn't really like this toy for my dog. I couldn't really fit any treats in this thing and the ones I could fit in fell out very easily. This wasn't a challenge at all for my dog and I regret buying it. I think that with some of these treat ball toys the company wants you to buy their treats that are specific to the toy. I understand the marketing ploy, but I like my dog to eat natural/organic food. I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone. It seemed like a big waste of money and didn't hold my dog's interest whatsoever."
4,Excellent alternative to hard plastic treat dispensing toys,"Unlike the Buster Cube and other hard plastic treat dispensing toys, this toy is soft, so when your dog rolls it around the floor to get the treats, you won't want to pull your hair out and your floors and furniture will not be damaged. Another key benefit is that you can adjust the size of the opening by unscrewing the two parts a little more, making it easy to use a range of food or treat sizes. This gets regular use at my house."
3,Twist a treat,"Not the favorite among my dogs--they would try for awhile, but it seemed like too much work for too little reward"
3,Too easy,"They figured this out right away, and they aren't particularly bright dogs to begin with. If the treats aren't spectacular they will roll the toy all over the floor in the hope that there will be a great treat in there somewhere, and then you will have a floor full of kibble to sweep up. A more difficult-to-release-the-treats toy would enable you to tell when they are rolling it to play or to actually get the contents to eat AND would make the game last longer."
2,not for big or powerful dogs,"I bought this toy for my parents' dog, who is a very strong and large (approx. 120lbs) mixed breed. He opened his present Christmas day and within minutes had chewed it to pieces. I think the idea of the toy is great but he was just too strong for it."
3,In little pieces,Great idea for a product. perfect for puppy to stay busy but when my little one got older she chewed it in to tiny pieces.Three stars for the idea and that it kept a small puppy busy.
4,Great for Cats too!,"We actually use this treat toy for our cats. Our cats are pretty petit. One is 5 lbs and one is 7 lbs, and they have no trouble with the small one. The small is large enough to put a small kibble meal in, so we have used this to give part of our cats breakfast in the morning when we leave for work. We have owned the product for about 2 years, and it has held up really well. We are not feeding any dry kibble at the moment, but still use it for treats, and it is nice that it is so adjustable for different sized kibble/treats. I don't love the rubber smell, and I have to say it has really only faded a little in the time that we have had it, but it wipes clean easily and it's nice that it's not noisy if they start rolling it around on a hard floor surface. I would recommend this for both dogs and cats!"
2,I'm not fond of this...it's hard to get the food out,"I ordered this along with a couple of other toys that dispense food, but I don't like this one. It's hard for my dog to get the food out of this one so she just gives up. I threw it away. I don't recommend this one at all. Instead I would recommend the ""Premier Busy Buddy Bristle Bone Dog Toy"" and the ""StarMark Bob-A-Lot Interactive Dog Toy"". She loves both of them and are easier for her to get the food out of. The Bristle Bone requires refills and I get the Premier Busy Buddy Refill Ring in Cornstarch rather than the rawhide....I think it's healthier for my dog. The Bob-A-Lot is easy for her to get food from because all she has to do is push on it with her nose or feet to get the food."
3,Dog like to carry it around,Very good but if you have a big dog be careful the treats are small and may cause choking. I bought two also the medium size. Peanut butter works if you leave it alittle open.
2,not good for puppies,My dog chewed thru this toy in less than 20 minutes. She had the treats out in no time at all. I will say she still enjoys carrying it around the house even though I no longer can put treats inside it however!
5,Fun for my Frenchie!,I got this for my French Bulldog when he was a puppy to occupy him while I was crate training him. He did really well with it and I could adjust the difficulty easily. I started him out with the small one and as he got older I got the larger one so I could fit a whole serving in it.When he got older he developed epilepsy and the phenobarbitol has made him even more food obsessed and even lazier. This toy is perfect because it occupies him enough that he can be food obsessed and he gets a little exercise too. By the time he's eaten his food he's worn out enough that he's ready for a nap instead of snuffling around looking for things to get into.My favorite thing about this toy is that you can adjust it for the kibble or treats you are putting in it. My second favorite thing is how easy it is to clean. The only downside is it sometimes gets stuck under furniture.
3,Very beginner level food puzzle,"I purchased the large for my 50 lb lab mix. The side opening is just large enough to allow pieces of kibble to fall thru when tightened to the most challenging position. The toy easily dispenses food with just the nudge of a nose making this a good option for beginners. The top and bottom halves tend to come unscrewed easily making it very easy for all of the food to dump out. The toy is softer rubberized plastic making it quiet on hard floor surfaces. For that, it earns it's stars.The toy is not very challenging, but it does slow down eating. For more challenging options, I recommend the Buster Cube or one of the Nina Ottosson games.As many other reviews have stated or at least alluded to, this is for supervised play. If your dog chews everything up, it will chew this up too. Again the Buster Cube might be a better option, as it is too big to fit in most dog's mouths.Overall, I am satified with the product, I just don't find it particularly inventive or impressive."
2,NOT for power chewers,"What self-respecting mid-size dog isn't a power chewer? I have a 36 lb. border collie mix and she chewed large chunks off this within 5 minutes, perhaps less. It's a nice idea, though to keep them busy. The smaller ones may be good for smaller dogs but there is no point to the larger sizes; the material is much too soft. Get this if your mid-sized dog is elderly and mentally focused but can only gum things."
1,Easily chewed up,"I bought the medium for my Staffordshire terrier to ""mix it up"" with her toys when she is crated. Within a few hours she had gnawed enough off of it that pieces of rubber were coming out and I had to take it away for her own safety. The flying saucer shape is really interesting and moves/rolls in fun ways, but the durability is definitely lacking. However, I have also purchased the Busy Buddy squirrel and the ""Waggle"" bone and those two items, even though they are the same brand, have held up fine!"
5,BooBoo loves it!,BooBoo loves it! What else can you say? He rolls it around on the floor banging it on chair legs and other furniture until its empty. It is sturdy and shows very little chew marks. It is easy to clean and adjusts easily to the kibble size. So far so good. Hans and Klaus like Boo's toy too. I would definitely recommend this toy for other dogs.
3,Dog loves it too much: chewed it to pieces.,Nice idea . My friend's dog tosses it in the air over & over to get the food to tumble out.My dog tries to chew it open.
3,Cool but not tough,"The concept is cool, it twists apart and you put treats in it, leaving it open a bit so they can work to ge them out. My Big Dog Shepherd mix loved it, but the first night she was tearing it apart a little piece at a time. I hated to take it away but couldn't let her eat the plastic. The medium is about 5 inches apart and fairly heavy so I thought it would last a bit. I'm disappointed. If your dog is a chewer, it won't last long."
5,our pit mix loves this toy,"We got this toy several years ago for our 40-pound pit mix. She really loves this toy. She is a fairly aggressive chewer, and she did not destroy it like some other reviewers mentioned. I wonder if that happens more with puppies because they tend to be fairly enthusiastic chewers (with sharp puppy teeth). Anyway, her toy was starting to get a little worn, and we were thinking of replacing it. Now we can't find it, so we just ordered another one today."
5,Sonny love this!,"My little guy loves interactive toys. When he sees me pick this up, he gets excited. It usually takes him 10-15 minutesto empty it. And it's small enough to put in my purse when we go visiting."
2,Our chihuhua mix will chew off chunks of this!!!,"This is not durable enough to leave with our 10lb chihuhua/daschund during the day, as after watching him play with it in the evening he will begin to gnaw on it and break chunks of plastic off! which I then need to take out of his mouth, terrible! This is good for supervised use ONLY."
2,Does Not Really Work Like It Should,"Someone gave this as a gift to my dog. The idea of it is great, but it doesn't really work well. You're supposed to screw the two halves together and depending on how ""tightly"" they are, the crack between them adjusts to allow different sized treats to fall out. The problem is often-times, it's either too tight or too loose, meaning the treats either don't fall out at all or all fall out within 5 seconds. I haven't used it much because of this, since my dog either gets frustrated because nothing ever comes out or eats all the treats quickly."
2,Ok challenge,"It's a fun shape, and pretty durable, but I found the method of release to easy, my dogs figured it out - and got all the treats out - too quickly."
4,My yorkies LOVE it!,"This is great to entice your dogs to eat their left overs! I always put leftovers into it and they finish it fast! I'm glad I purchased this because it's better than I had expected. However, must take away the toy after they finish, otherwise, they start chewing the rubber. Some of the rubber is coming off...and I had it since Christmas..."
1,Not even close to indestructible,"We have a 6 month ago pit bull puppy and this toy didnt even last a day, or 2 hours for that matter. He tore the plastic and the treats fell out. I do not recommend this toy unless you have a dog that doesnt chew."
3,Twist and Treat,These are great toys but they run out of treats too fast. The best thing to do is put some yogurt or honey mixed with your treats and freeze them.
2,not very durable,I bought this toy for my dog and it only lasted 2 days. It works great for entertaining them with treats but if you have an active chewer it will not stand up to them. my dog was able to chew it enough that treats no longer stay inside at all.
2,Not as durable as I thought it would be.,I'm sure this would be great for a dog that doesn't care to chew. Ours wanted to chew it up after the food came out. We found the Buster Cube works much better for our dogs.
3,NOT DURABLE!,I am changing my review because for my recent dog he was able to get a chunk out already. This is NOT a toy for powerful chewers as others have said. It worked fine for my smaller 30lb dog but NOT for my 8month old (now 1yr old) White German Shepherd. I have to keep an eye out that he doesn't start taking more chucks out. He loves this toy and it does what it needs to but its NOT DURABLE like they claim it is!I'd only recommend this for med-smaller sized dogs.
2,destroyed in 2 hours by our 20 lb dog,"this toy is great if you dog doesn't chew things up. our dog had lots of fun playing with it to get the kibbles until he destroyed it, but the rubber is very soft and not at all durable like a kong and he gouged a huge hole in it after just a couple hours."
5,Simple and Great !,I was hesitant after reading the trouble some had with filling this toy ! Amazing... it is simple !Pro'sNot loud for indoor useYou can determine how much is dispensed by how tight you turn it.Stong material (pieces can be chewed off)Dish Washer Ease in cleaningGood Size for pup to carryCon'sCan fit under furnitureHINTSUse Peanut Butter to add some attention to the toyvary treat sizes in the same batch to create some more action needed.
4,Twist N Treat Dog Toy,"This item is very durable, but a little difficult to adjust properly for the size of the dog food. My dog loves puzzle-type toys and flips this one all over the house until all the food is gone and eaten. I should have ordered the large size instead of the small which holds only a very small amount of food."
2,Maybe for a toy dog,"I have to agree that it's not durable. I filled it with treats and gave it to my 1 yr. old, 25 pound dog. With 2 minutes there was rubberized plastic bits all over the carpet and who knows how much he swallowed. An enormous waste of money."
2,NOT for chewers,"I have two dogs an italian greyhound and lab mix (a VERY strong powerful chewer). This toy would be good for a more delicate chewer. The concept is great and could keep a non-chewer occupied for a little while. But my lab mix had this entire toy in pieces within 5 minutes, so I would not recommend this for dogs that are powerful."
1,lasted about 10 minutes,Lasted about 10 minutes with my dog then went to the trash good concept cheap quality. Gave my little one about an 1/8 of a cup of kibble in this toy which he had fun getting out then once the food was gone it was time to eat the toy itself. Maybe if they used stronger rubber (like a Kong toy) they could last more than 10 minutes. Oh well lesson learned
4,Treat ball !,It works great....just put small treats or break them in pieces and leave the rest to the dog! I have a cocker spaniel.
3,"It's okay if your dog is not an ""avid"" chewer","I have a 30lb dog who is a year old. She is what is known as an""avid"" chewer. I thought this would be strong enough for her - it's not. She LOVED it, though. I think all dogs are smart in their own way so what I'm about to say, I don't think is just ""her"", but she figured out the concept in about 2 min. Meaning, she figured out how to flip it exactly to get all the treats pouring out and this is on the hard level. I wish it were stronger and had been harder for her. It lasted a week in our house and then she chewed up so much of it, I had to throw it away. Even after she got all the treats out, she still enjoyed it. I think she liked the shape."
2,Hard to use,"I bought this toy because my dog has a rubber ball that dispenses food and she LOVES it. This one however, wasn't such a hit with her. I personally found it hard to load so that the treats didn't all fall out at once but still let some out gradually."
1,Not strong enough,My dog quickly got board and just decided to eat the toy. It is not stong enough for puppies with excessive chewing. My dog also digested the toy.
1,"Chewers will kill this in minutes, good idea, poor materials","I should have trusted the other reviews. Great idea and my mini dachshund loves it, maybe too much. He's completely destroyed it in less than a day. Good idea, poor materials. If a 13 pound mini dachshund can chew this to bits any dog can and likely will. Somewhat dangerous too my if they swallow the bits the chew off. I never thought of my dog as a vigorous chewer before, but if there's food involved I guess he is."
3,It's a cool idea...,"But my dogs didn't like it. I was hoping to distract him when we leave the house, but he wasn't much interested in the toy."
1,Dog's show NO interest in this,I bought this for my Lab puppy and full grown Westie. Both show NO interest in the toy. I also have not had luck getting kibble to fit well in the toy. The food pours out of it even on a tighter setting.
2,Not for Strong Chewers,"I have a 65lb shepard/lab mix who is a strong chewer. My dog loved this toy when i put treats in it, but within a couple of times she ripped chunks off the top making the toy useless. At first, she would roll the toy around to make the treats fall out, and then she got tired of doing that and just ripped the whole thing open. My dog can chew through a medium sized(10"") rawhide in a couple of hours."
4,Great Interactive Toy,This size is great for tiny dogs.Our puppy plays with it when it's got treats in it and when it doesn't. He's teething and the rubber is durable and is firm.His size kibble is very small and falls out too easily so it's not much of a challenge for him. Maybe it will be more challenging when he starts eating kibble that's a bit larger. Using the suggested snack also works well.
4,durable fun,My dog likes this toy and it withstands his attempts to chew it up. The only problem is either the treats come out too easily or not enough so it only occupies him for about 15 minutes. But I still think it is a good mental exercise so I recommend it.
2,my dog thinks this is stupid,"I kept trying to get him to chase the 'top' to get the treats out. He really wouldn't play with it. I too, put nibble sized food inside.When I tried washing it in the dishwasher, it just turned a powdery purple color ... that even I didn't like.save your $$"
3,It was lost after two days,"This is a neat little toy, really. We have (had) the small, and very little food fit inside, so this is really just for play/snacks. And our puppy seemed to love rolling it around. But. No one can find it anywhere. We've looked under furniture and moved things around, and it's nowhere.So, the toy is strong and durable and does exactly what the description said. But the small one is too easy to lose. We've bought a lot of dog toys, and this is the only one that we never eventually found. I should note, though, that we also have a cat. My guess is that she's the one who found the impossible hiding place!"
4,Twist and Treat,"The Twist and treat is nicely portable, easy to open/close/wash, not too noisy on hard-wood, and fits small kibble very well. Make sure you remove it after the kibble is gone, as our small dog (Puggle) loves to gnaw on it and it is pretty easy to tear pieces off. Even after several good gnawings, it still works well."
2,My dog destroyed it within minutes!,"Unforunately one of my labs was chewing on this and bit a chunk out after I gave it to her. I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the durability of this item. It was a great idea and was easy to fill, but it didn't even last 20 minutes."
2,Toy,You can only fit a limited size treat in the product. My puppy was excited at first then lost interest after the 3-4 time. Good idea that just needed a little more design.
1,Rip off!!!,My 55 pound lab destroyed this within 2 minites. Not durable at all. Don't waste your money.
2,difficult,IT was difficult to adjust the openings. It just screws together and you loosen or tighten it to adjust for kibble size. Our dogs were able to take it apart very fast and eat everything inside and move on.
3,Twists open too easily,"We probably should have gotten the large size for our dog but PetSmart didn't carry it. His kibble is too large to fall out of the medium size when it's screwed on tightly but if it's too loose, he easily twists it open himself in a few minutes. It is showing signs of wear after about a month and he's not really a big chewer. He prefers gnawing on bones but I bet if he wanted to he could rip it to shreds.We have found it useful as a freezer toy. It's good for filling with soft foods, then freezing. It takes him much longer to unscrew it and keeps him entertained in his crate while we're at work."
2,My Cocker chewed through this in less than 15 min,"Very disappointed considering the cost. Hard to adjust size of opening - it was either too large, or too small. My main complaint though is that my 24 pound cocker spaniel pretty much demolished this in such a short period of time. I was glad I happened to be watching so that I could take the small pieces away as they broke off."
3,small dog can damage it easily,"I have a 15lb minpin who chewed chunks out of this within 5 mins... its not for strong/powerful chewers, at all. I'll stick with the bustercube thats plastic!"
1,Great Idea ...Poor Execution,"I bought this for my two year old mini aussie. She likes to tear things apart, but in general it takes her several days to destroy a flimsy squeaky toy, however the twist and treat did not last more than a hour. I had great hope for the twist and treat and envisioned it as something that would keep my dog occupied for short periods of time. She took it out of my hand ripped it apart and had the treats out right away. I was out $10 bucks with nothing to show for it. My dog is not destructive nor an aggressive chewer, and she simply ripped the thing apart. I will never ever buy this again for her."
4,Thumbs up from the Dog,"As long as there is a treat inside the dog won't put it down. Really seems to enjoy playing it with to get the treat. It's a nice toy to occupy the dog when you when you need to get something done. All kinds of treats can go inside, some are easier than others to remove but they all work."
2,3 minutes,A nice shape but it took my red Heeler x 180 seconds to chew a chunk off. It only cost me [...] but that's quite expensive for 3 minutes entertainment when you think about it ;-)
1,not for chewers-don't waste your money!,I love the concept of this. I thought I would try this for my 8 month old 80 pound Cane Corso since she destroyed her molecule that was interactive. Big mistake. I put peanut butter inside which kept her busy for a few minutes. When she was done with that she proceed to rip it apart. Way too soft of a material. I will have to stick with Kong and Nylabone.
1,No Challenge,"I have a 15lb mini-pinscher mix. This toy is not a challenge. The first time I gave him this toy, he unscrewed the 2 pieces and had access to all the treats. The second time, I tightened the toy as tight as possible. Within a minute he had unsrewed it again. This toy is not a challenge and I would not recommend it."
2,destroyed within 5 minutes,"This looks like a good idea, but sadly my dog didn't bother to play with it at all before she just chewed it into a million pieces. The material is kinda waxy... dog couldn't resist."
2,MY SCOTTIE KILLED IT!!,"My beautiful Scottie (almost 12 years old) killed this within an hour of letting her have it. To be fair, I have found very few that can withstand her powerful bite, thought for the money - this shold have lasted longer!"
1,my puppy chewed right through it,Great idea but my puppy was able to chew right through it on the very first day!
1,lasted 5 minutes with my 22 pound dog,this is not a sturdy product it lasted 5 minutes with my little dog what a total waste of money. stay away from this product
2,"Not very useful, too small","Nice idea, doesn't hold enough (I have the small one). Dog likes it so if it were bigger it might be better. Can only hold tiny kibble"
4,"Great, but don't put in dishwasher","I love that this is adjustable and you can screw it up or down to adjust the size of the gap based on the size of treats you're putting in. But wash it by hand! we put it in the dishwasher (on the top rack which is less hot than lower rack) and after that the screw part didn't work smoothly anymore. I guess it expanded a little from the heat in the dishwasher and so it doesn't screw together well anymore. still works, but it doesn't screw down as far as it used to."
2,Too quick and easy and material not tough enough,"I bought the medium size for my Yorkie-Poo since being a Yorkie, he is an avid chewer and nothing lasts for him except Kong type toys. This toy lasted one month. I took it away after the food was dispensed, which took him only 5 minutes no matter how tight I closed it, so he couldn't chew it up. But just from chewing on it to get the food dispensed, bits and pieces started coming off. Good concept, just dispenses food too quickly and product not tough enough."
2,treat toy,This is nice if your dog doesn't chew. My Border Collie distroyed his the first time i gave it to him. My little dogs do well with theirs but need to monitor my BC around them so he doesn't eat the whole thing. It is nice for dogs that eat their meals to fast.
3,sturdy,the treats either fall out too fast or not at all. I have tried to play around with it in several ways and there is no way to work with it to make it perfect. I have another toy that is for the same purpose which works great. I am disappointed with this one. great idea but wish it would work better.
2,Eh..,This product wasn't so great. My dog didn't like the treats that fit in here and he didn't like playing with it or chewing on it.
2,"Not my favorite, too easy to get treats out","This is not my favorite food toy, the food comes out too easily unless it's the perfect size and even then, I find other toys work better. Seems to be more a way for them to sell their own treats designed for it, but even those fell out pretty quickly. On the plus side, it's smaller than some treat toys, and relatively quiet since it's plastic. Chewers may just chew right through it to get at the treats though."
1,Lasted less than 30 minutes,My lab had destroyed this within 30 minutes. He chewed at the opening so treats wouldn't stay. He does not ruin about 80% of his toys - this one went the quickest
5,Terrific toy,"I am owned by a rambunctious, precious, spoiled and slightly psychotic Shitzu. And this is one of the best gifts I've given her.You twist open the two pieces (like a big, purple, rubber Oreo cookie) and then fill it up with small treats. I use flat disc type treats but the great thing is that you can adjust the opening for any style of bite-size rewards. This is also good so that you can start out by letting one fall out when you roll it across the floor, let the dog know what's inside, and then take it back and twist it a little tighter so that they now have to work a little harder for them.. Happy torture!It's very durably constructed for a small dog but I don't know about bigger breeds. All I know is that my dog loves it."
5,AWESOME for my beagle,"my beagle is a chewer, and she is in love with this toy. we've had one for a year or so, purchased at a local pet store, and it has held up very well. there are teeth marks in it and whatnot, but it still functions great, even with daily use. I like to smear a bit of peanut butter or put some liver treats in it and she will chew and lick until every last morsel is gone. It keeps her occupied and chewing on something she should chew on. My only gripe is that I wish I could tighten the toy more, to make it harder for her. Otherwise, every dog I ever have will have one of these."
1,Horrible smell,I should have sent this toy back immediately. The plastic/rubber smell is so overwhelming that I didn't want my dogs to touch it! It's been out on the front porch for over two weeks now in hopes that the toy would off gas enough to use it...no such luck. It will probably end up in the garbage.
2,don't leave your dog unattended,"I purchased this for my lab/terrier mix, and within 5 minutes she had gotten out all the treats and torn off a piece of the plastic disk. Not for strong chewers!"
2,Stunning moments desolve into confusion,"The opening grabs the reader and pulls you into a strange world of the dead and the near dead. Angel flash backs are always interesting to further establish his character. Also the faint Buffy references provide a nice continuity. But the flash backs between Angel's life, Meg's life and the past often break up the action. In the end as masks are removed and villians become victems there is no satisfaction and much confusion. Angel's encounter with an dying old woman is the most touching I've read in a long time. I almost wished for an epilogue in which Angel finds the child and passes the memory so she is not forgotten. I enjoyed the book but the plotting is not Ms Holder's best."
3,Hard work to read; rewarding but exhausting novel.,"I read all the other available Angel books, but could never get into this. I tried starting it several times. The beginning had too many original characters, too much confusing mixed mythology (and I have blood relatives in South East Asia so it is not a cultural bias I am talking about...). Finally I had finished Avatar and had no new Angel or Buffy or Sixth Sense novels to read ((The SIXTH SENSE books are for ""intermediate readers"" but are TERRIFIC and should not be missed. I am over 20 years old and I mean this.)) I tried once more to read NOT FORGOTTEN; it continued to be ""more work"" than the other novels in the series---but, you know what?, it did pay off. I would have preferred an easier read, but I was desperate and it DID give me an Angel reading experience, with much reward, when there was nothing else available. I'm glad of that."
2,Not for real.,"It took me a few minutes after I read the book to figure out what had just happened. This book has to be the worst in the series. It tries to mix humor in with Angel's broody nature and it fails. Can anyone out there who watches the show actually picture Angel responding to the question ""what are you doing here?"" with ""livin' la vida loca""? It isn't a terrible book but it just doesn't stand out like ""Redemption"" for example. It does have it's strong points though but other parts are either confusing or just plain boring, especially the strange ending."
2,Not as good as it could have been,"This book is about a cult worshiping an Indonesian death god and bringing over illegal immigrant as sacrifices. This book had the potential to be really good, but was rushed and confusing near the end. The writer also needs to do more research. In the Buffy episode, Halloween, it's said that Angel was 18 and still alive in 1775, but in Not Forgotten he supposedly became a vampire in 1752, 5 years before he was even born."
3,Okay Book,"If you're an avid Angel fan, then you probably already read this. But for those of you who haven't: I'd advise you not to unless you want to end up really confused. Overall, plot was pretty good, but kind of at the climax of the story...it appears as though the writer left out a few pages. It's an alright book, but City Of, Redemtion, Close to the Ground, and all thereafter are much better."
1,Expected better,"I've come to expect better from this author. The book reaches a climax but not a conclusion. There are numerous loose ends and many unexplained happenings. It is as if the author ran out of ideas. It would have been just as effective if she had skipped the last few pages and written ""The good guys won. The End"". Definitely not her best work."
3,Not What I Expected,"The story idea was good but it was confusing attimes. Ms. Holder is one of the best authors for the BtVS and Angelnovels but this book was somewhat of a let down. I did enjoy the Batman references though. To make this short, this book is not the best but definetly worth reading."
3,"Not what I'd hoped for, but still pretty good","Angel, Cordelia, and Doyle go to battle against the Indonesian god of death and his obssessive followers after a series of mysterious deaths and Angel's telepathic connection to a potential victim. Interesting idea, and I like the flashbacks into Angel's past, as well as seeing Doyle again, but everything gets rushed and confused at the end. Good portrayal of the characters keep it interesting, but I think things swerved a little at the end and the climax could have been better"
2,Cute scenes Bad Plot,"If your just getting into the Angel books , do your self a favor don`t read this one. Like so many have said before me , "" It grabs you then confuses you."" There are a few cute scenes : Like Angel getting a speeding tickett and a scene with a dying old women. Not one of best , not somthing to waste your money on. But hey, don`t judge The series by one badly written book . Redemption and City Of.. are the best."
1,Waste of Money,"I really did not like this Angel book. Meg, Latura and Jusefwere getting more boring as it went on. I personally thing this wasthe worst Angel book so far."
3,Decent,"This is a decent video card. It really isn't fast enough to run current games at their full potential. But for basic computing, older games without high end graphics and internet browsing, this will more than meet your needs. The big problem I had was updating the drivers. You have to uninstall the previous driver first, and then install the updated version. But I ran into problems with Win XP not loading it's own driver for the card in order to bring anything up on the monitor until I could install the new drivers. So I would have a blank screen. So unless it really is needed, I would recommend leaving the updating alone as it is really a chore."
1,Horrible,the trumpet makes a great sound but the valves don't work. it does not matter how much valve oil I put into it the valves keep sticking to the bottom of the trumpet it got stuck once.don't buy this trumpet.
1,"TERRIBLE TRUMPET - LOOKS GOOD, DOESN'T WORK","I purchased this item for my son, and should have known better since I was a professional musician for half my life. There is a GOOD reason this is so cheap... it is of unbelievably poor quality. It looks beautiful and can produce a decent tone once the valves are in position, but the valves do not work. They stick constantly, which is very frustrating for the beginner who is working hard on embouchure and fingering, only to find that it is hopeless since the valves are ridiculously non-responsive. Valve oil does not help. I'm a double reed player myself, so I had a professional trumpet player inspect the trumpet to get his advice, and he agrees it is absolutely worthless. Save your money and either rent something of higher quality, or spend the dough to get something better. I hope this review helps!!"
1,got Ausmus? Adult Cap T-Shirt,"I purchased a large thinking this was an adult T-shirt. No it was not!This shirt was not even large enough for my teenage daughter to wear.Maybe a 10 to 12 year old female could wear it, but certainly not an adult. Bad advertising in my opinion."
1,Not for music appreciation.,"This is an interesting film for experimental film buffs or Charleston Heston fans. It is NOT designed to help introduce youngsters to beautiful music. The DVD does have the Peer Gynt Suite as its soundtrack, but the audio quality is inferior, so if you are trying to encourage youngsters to listen to classical music, buy a CD with a good symphony release of this masterpiece."
1,Disappointing,This novel is truly disappointing. I've been an admirer or Pico Iyer's non-fiction work for a long time but I couldn't find anything to like in this book. It's repetitive and boring--you keep hoping something will happen to redeem the narrative but it never does.
1,SAVE YOUR DOUGH!,"This book is a big waste of time and money.The author should never write fiction, or anything that requires an imagingation.I understand that he went to lots of famous schools and has been everywhere in the world (except the places in this book, apparently). What an embarassment for the schools.Didn't his education help him realize that this book was excruciating, and needed to be edited by someone who actually cared how painful this would be to read?"
2,"Yep, disappointing","Great idea for a novel but it doesn't work. Not here, anyway. I like Iyer and wanted so hard to like this novel. Unfortunately, the characters are completely unsympathetic. Whatever it is that keeps bringing them together is never exerienced by the reader. Occasionally wants to be a mystery story--John gets home and finds out someone was on his computer earlier. Never worries about it again. Hmm. The various persons with manuscripts and what they may have known or not and how their narratives might have played out was the only thing that really captured my interest. But that would have been a different book. A more interesting one, I expect."
2,Weak tea,"I heard the review on NPR and bought the book on the strength of it. I was predisposed to like this book but didn't. I share the views of the other reviewers that Camilla and McMillan have no grit as characters. As a reader, I couldn't care less what happens to her and never want to encounter her again. I kept thinking that if she weren't such a beauty, would our hero McMillan bother with such an irritatingly pathetic child. I don't know this writer's other work, but after reading this book, I feel he may have spent a little too long in California drinking weak herbal tea."
4,a must!,"This book let me say has it all! A really great and easy to read history-type book on the incan civilization and colonial society in the Andes. It's very well written and includes so many interesting and no so obvious details. It's easy to understand and a fast read. The only complaint I have is that it's a bit repetitive throughout the chapters, but for students, that's not a bad thing!"
2,Software Application Crashing,"I have Windows Vista 32 with Duo Core + 4 G SDRAM PC, I installed the PCI capture card and the program Studio version 11.1.2.Connected my miniDV camcorder via DVI port.Tested the capture via the software and via windows.It worked well upto that point but when I tried to preview the file via Studio 11, it would crash and force dump the application.I uploaded the patches but still nothing is working.I am still going to try to fix it but if I cant then I will just scratch Studio 11 and switch to Vegas Movie Studio 9."
2,Poor Poor Noel,"I may have just listened to only the samples on line. But, I can already tell you...Noel, you have lost your touch. They sound very ""high school"" type of music. I loved your playing with Jimi, I feel you went down hill. Sorry bud. I always will remember you old style. I even own one of your SIGNED bass guitars...number 771. Good luck."
4,good little speaker mounts,I just wanted small speaker mounts for my rear speakers of my souround system. These are a good small size for this and match the gray/black of my curent speakers as well.
2,Pretty Dull,"Even for young children (2-4 yrs.), this book needs some VOOOOM! It's a story that says, A cutesy, 'See all the things God does.' Page after page of this gets pretty tiresome."
5,Just what I needed,"These bowls were just what I needed. I love the timeless beauty of Spode Blue Italian and use this pattern for everyday use and entertaining. Often I ""create"" a dip tray with a bowl that doesn't match as the Ascot cereal bowls are too large. These dip dishes are perfect and I will use them often. They arrived quickly and in great condition."
2,She doesn't like it,"Our female cat had a favorite squeaky mouse toy covered with real fur. We were trying to find something with real fur, thinking that this was part of the attraction. It's more complicated than just being covered with fur. These Fur mice are hard--not compressible. I think that the cat likes something that her teeth will actually sink into, and that is not what this Fur Mouse is. This mouse looks fine to me, but for our cat it just isn't appealing."
3,.,"I liked the touch up spray, I used it on my car. I wish the touch up spray came in a actually spray bottle."
3,took forever,"finally received this item today october 20th. it took over a month and four attempts. there were some issues. seller was unwilling to help and referred me to manufacturer. it took a few minutes, but manufacturer was helpful, and so far things look good. still, i am upset that it took four attempts to send out the product in good condition as it was sent to shipping company damaged on three occasions."
1,Horrible product - Came broken in various places!!!,VERY DISSAPOINTED!! I think they resent me the damaged unit that a previous customer complained about. Doesn't the company know that's bad business. I got my money back and they paid for the shipping return. Still...........throw this in the dumpster & don't keep sending this to other customers!! The box was ripped in varous places when it was delivered. It had was reinforced with plastic wrap to hold it together. I opened it and various pieces were snapped right in have. Cheap mdf!!
5,One more great British detective series,I have yet to preview a British police series that was not excellent. This one is no excepion.I was late finding this series but am really enjoying it.
1,"Fine series, defective edition",We were enjoying the first episode on disk one of this set when the picture froze during the final scenes. Amazon did a very prompt and simple replacement and we had our new copy within one week. The replacement proved defective at the exact same place. We confirmed the problem using two additional DVD players -- this is a manufacturing defect.BBC should have caught this defective lot before distribution -- there is no excuse for this from a major media producer. It is particularly egregious to encounter a play defect right in the middle of the denouement scenes of a mystery story!The program itself is very engaging -- we particularly enjoyed the by-play between the two contrasting lead characters.
5,Bring to USA,"I always enjoyed this show and have several on tape. Cannot understand why they haven't been released here in the USA. It seems like every show is being released so why not this one? Soon, please!!"
2,Do not like!,"Personally I do not like Dalziel and Pascoe, mainly because of language and attitude.I love mysteries. I order quite a lot of them. I am going to return this set."
2,Dalziel & Pascoe,This is the first time we have seen this series. Both my husband and did not like it and will not be buying any more.
1,HORRIBLE BOOTLEG...KEEP AWAY!,"This is a horrible bootleg edition with tacky art work of ""Carcel de Mujeres"" (Mexico 1951). The film itself is not bad and it boasts an excellent cast of female stars including Sarita Montiel, Katy Jurado, Emma Roldan, Miroslava and Maria Douglas among others. This DVD bootleg was done from a bad print of the film which is very dark, lacks sharpness and contrast plus there's noise in the soundtrack. Another insult to consumers who like films in Spanish. Keep away from it!"
1,Not the real thing,I love this scent and have used it for years but I believe I was shipped counterfeit goods with this order. The perfume is green instead of the trademark blue color. It has made me leery of ordering perfume online.
3,good people to deal with,When I used the first one it broke. I used another and it was ok. They did replace the broken one free and without any hassle though.
5,Astro Pneumatic 2181 Double Cut Carbide Rotary Burr Set with 1/4-Inch Shank,Astro Pneumatic 2181 Double Cut Carbide Rotary Burr Set with 1/4-Inch ShankThis set of double cut carbide rotary burr's is everything I had hoped it would be. Great price point and quality that should stand up to the tasks I have in mind.It also comes with a decent FREE plastic case if you do not have a drawer for these.I have included some close pictures so you know what your buying and hopefully from the words I've shared can easily make a good buying decision.Buy these with confidence.RagenRat :0)
5,Astropneumatic Carbid bits,"These are absolutely worth the money. Just looking at the case I'd wager a bet that every set not made in the states comes from the same overseas factory, regardless they work excellent. I can't believe I went this long with out buying carbid burrs. I've only used them on mild steel/welded mild, but it chews through both with ease and there still is no visible wear on the bits. I would/will definitely buy them again if mine ever wear out or are lost."
3,spa bath pillow,"Product is overpriced. Smaller than desirable and not as comfortable as expected. Pillow needs to be ""fuller"", thicker and more pillow-like for comfort."
1,"meh, its not really worth it","I saw the other reviews and figured I'd still give it a shot. It definitely is not worth the purchase. The suction cups don't stay in the slots, which I expected based on other reviewers, but the real problem is the foam inside the vinyl cover is not a solid piece. After one use, the two foam pieces inside got jigged up such that they aren't a uniform shape. I'm really disappointed in this."
4,I would recommend this pillow,Very well made. Constructed of dense foam for a good cushion with 3 suction cups to hold in place and small enough to tuck away in a small drawer.
4,aptly named,"This is a cute little pillow. It looks good, feels good and arrived quickly to my doorstep. It looks like it will stand the test of time too - it won't deflate that's for sure."
3,"As described, but the suction cups don't work","It looks great in my tub- very clean and simple. The greatest issue is that the suction cups will not stick to the tub. I've tried a dozen times, and it inevitably falls to the bottom of the tub when there is no water, or floats away until I get in when there is. I want it to stick in the same place so I can just leave it there. It's driving me crazy that it won't do that."
4,Great spa pillow for the price,"I was skeptical when I received this pillow. I had already had a bad experience with ordering a spa pillow from another company through Amazon. This one was a pleasant surprise. It's great quality and comfortable and I believe it's not going to turn moldy after using it for a while. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was the suction is not the greatest but I've yet to find one that has great suction. It's worth the money, in my opinion."
4,good product,the only thing that could make this product better is if it wasn't so flat. I also have this suction pillow in the below link (pillow D). It was a better design but not as soft. The shape of the pillow to this link is actually designed to conform to your neck and head better.[...]
2,"Nice pillow, had to be replaced after 4 months","Not much more to say, it lasted 4 months or about a total of 10 uses. Not an item that I would reccomend."
2,Thumbs down,Suction cups pull off and don't stay in place. Expensive for inferior product. material and cushioning are good. Too bad it doesn't do the job
2,disappointed,"I got this to replace another foam pillow that I have had for several years. This pillow is rather flat and does not give any support to your neck if you are using it in a standard bathtub. If you have a tub w/ a sloped back, I'm sure it is fine as a head cushion, but my old pillow was much thicker and actually supported my neck/head while lying in the tub. This provides a tiny ledge for your head, but absolutely no neck support. Not what I was hoping for and will keep looking for something more similar to my last one."
3,comfy,"Comfy pillow, but suction cups on the back started popping off after the first use.Can't expect a foam pillow to defy the laws of physics, so I can't complain that it isn't useful for underwater (lumbar) support--wish I could find something like that. And, if the designers wanted to add a loop somewhere so that it could be hung out of the way between baths, that would be nice.That said, it IS very comfortable."
1,Doesn't stick to tub,"Very nice pillow, but I couldn't get mine to stick to the tub for more than 2 minutes at a time. The color is perfect (biscuit). Matches a biscuit tub perfectly. Just wish it would stick to the tub!"
1,Cheap product,Certainly not worth the price. I would not buy this pillow again. The suction cups pop out not only when the pillow is in use but even when you're trying to pop them back in. Very annoying. Worth about $1.99 - certainly not over $20.00.
4,Pretty nice.,This bath pillow came fairly soon and is a great size. Much larger than I thought it would be. The plastic is alittle sticky but after a soak or two it is fine. Over all pretty pleased.
3,spa pillow,At first I had a hard time getting it to stay in place. Once I was able to do that it has worked out OK. I have tried so many before and this one for now seems to work.
2,jellybean pillow,This was very disappointing. The suction cups did not hold well in the tub. The design was not as comfortable and it looks.
5,jellybean is sweet!,I use this pillow in my hot tub and I love it. It doesn't get moldy or gross and is perfect for making leaning against my tub comfortable and relaxing. Thank you!
1,don't waste your money...,This bath pillow simple doesn't work. The suction cups do not hold it to the tub. It slips and slides and pops up when you lay back on it.
4,good taste but texture is chewy/dry,"flavor is good but the texture isnt as moist as i would like it to be. Its not plastic and cheap tasting like fruit roll ups, it tastes like you are eating something good for you. Good alternative to fruit snacks and fruit roll ups."
3,Weird,I havent seen the DVD yet but i think its really weird these DVDs arent following the books really at all. Its gonna be interesting to see what they do different in the 7th DVD
5,What I needed,This book was exactly what my husband & I needed. We received it as a gift and have since purchased many copies to pass on to other couples experiencing the gut wrenching pain or a pregnancy loss.
5,Brought restoration and more importantly HOPE,"I lost my daughter in my second trimester. I was devastated beyond words and was blaming myself. It was through reading this book provided by my sister that I was able to begin to heal, to grieve properly, to HOPE again. I highly recommend this book to any Christian woman dealing with the grief of a lost baby."
5,Great book,Empty Arms has really helped me deal with the loss of my child. There are so many great things that this book has taught me. If you have experienced a loss this is the perfect book for you!
3,We bought it for someone else based on other recommendations.,We bought this book for someone else based on how others told us it was. They told us it was really good for what happened to the people we know. They said it really ministered to them and the Lord used it to bring healing and restoration.
3,Great info...but...,"I have had two miscarriages and have not had a successful pregnancy to at this point.I read this book after reading ""I never held you"" I found the information in ""empty arms"" to be helpful and encouraging however ""I ever held you"" applied to my life more.I think that the writer may have phrased some sections differently if this book was written right after her still-birth. She takes on the ""you can just try again"" train of thought more than once. I think that this was why ""I never held you"" applied to me more because this author does not currently have children, and is still working through the ""God's will"" struggle with having children."
5,very helpful in grieving process,This book was very helpful in grieving for my baby who died during delivery. It helped me to know that my feelings are normal and really helped me to understand everything I was going through. I have recommended this to several of my grieving friends. I love the Christian perspective.
4,A great source book for grieving parents of a stillborn.,"I read this book one month after delivering my stillborn son. Although I found the information reassuring, I wish I had read the book when we found out that our son was not going to make it--several months before he was born. It answered all the questions I had, but was too heartbroken to ask. This is a great source book for parents that know ahead of time that their baby will be stillborn or die prematurely."
5,Slay bells,Book arrived in great shape. It arrived before they predicted it to arrive. This was for my son to do a school project. He was able to read the book and complete his assignment. Thank you for great service.
1,Be careful- Not what the picture saids it is,reading the description- I thought it was the floor railing that I was buying. Shows pictures of people using rail and describes how people use this rail. It turns out it's just a 68.95 floor plate. No rail included. What a crooked way to do business.
2,Nice display but lacks basic features,"When you try to cram too many features into one unit, basic features usually suffer and this is definitely the case with the Legacy LD34MUT. The display is nice but the unit doesn't have any ""Last position memory"" which means that your MP3 disk will start from the first song on your disk instead of where you left off. The display is nice and very readable (I gave one star for the display) The other star was for ease of installation as they did stick to the universal color code on the wiring harness, making it easy to match with my Toyota harness adapter. Documentation is poor and you'll have to search hard for answers. On one page they have a diagram labeling what all the buttons are for but the descriptions aren't even near the diagram - you'll have to search the whole manual."
4,"Glad To See ""The Friends"" On CD","Let's face it guys, ""Highly Distinct"" just didn't have the pop that ""Grazin"" had, but there're some good songs on ""Distinct"" (""let yourself go"", ""it's sunday""). It's just shows how hard it is to have two top ten songs (pop and soul charts) like ""grazin in the grass"" and ""going in circles"" on the same album, those ""Friends of Distinction"" pulled it off. You're gonna love their version of ""elis coming"", the girls are really showing their range on this one. I've listen to alot of FOD, and still can't tell who's singing between Jessica Cleaves and Charlene Gibson. What a pair of great voices. (here's a hint, Charlene sings ""love or let me be lonely"") Then there's ""peaceful"" another diamond in the rough. The Friends of Distinction, I'm sure you're gonna enjoy."
4,"great photos, inspiring ideas","It was so hot here in AZ this fall, I needed a jumpstart to get into the Halloween spirit. This was just the book. Great photos and seasonal recipes made me run out to buy sweet potatoes for making the baked chips! I envisioned keeping them on hand for lunches and snacks, but they were gone in a day. The black cats were cute, too, but we all suffered with black tongues after the fact. Plenty of other cute ideas for little ones.If you want Julia Child, don't buy this book; but if you want a holiday read, with great pictures and some nice recipes, find a notch on your bookshelf for this one."
3,"Beautiful pictures, some good ideas but not much substance","I enjoyed the wonderfully festive pictures and I was able to glean some ideas from her book as a starting point for my own Hallowe'en projects. However, I'm not so sure there is enough substance nor wholly original ideas to make it a worthwhile purchase. It is a fun book to thumb through but most of the ""magic"" is to be found in the photographs. I tried some of the recipies: the cocoa cobweb cupcakes were not ""chocolatey"" enough and the pumpkin soup was okay but not spectacular."
5,Fun book,"I've collected a lot of Halloween books over the years, and some of them have been real duds. I was relieved this was not one of those. The pics are cozy, there are some fun decorating ideas,and I found the recipes creative and different. I highly recommend both the book and the seller."
3,Cute,"This book is cute and has some fun ideas but not all the items have pictures and there is a lot of ""adult"" oriented food in there which is not why I bought it. A few cute ideas but I suggest buying it used to get your moneys worth."
5,Inquietante,El camuflaje que JJ utiliza entre la fantasia y la realidad es inquientante. Para aquellos de fe profunda y mente abierta es un reto al balance entre sus creencias religiosas y sus atrevimientos a dudarlas
2,see below,"I took a course which used this text, and I must say that that class was the least interesting class I have taken in my life. I think that looking at algebra from a geometric standpoint (and vice versa, an equivalent statement) ruins both algebra and geometry. Algebra is beautiful. Geometry is beautiful, but for a different reason. The intersection of their beauty (also, the beauty of their intersection) is the null set."
5,History of Architecture on the Comparative Method,"This hardcover 1961, 1366 pg., 17th Edition is an excellent and essential reference and a treasure trove of architectural history for architects or anyone interested in architecture through the ages. I earlier bought a less expensive printing of this book from Amazon without all the illustrations and drawings which are essential. The fact that my earlier purchase did not have illustrations and drawings was not in Amazon's product description, or I would not have bought it. This book was used, in very good condition and had everything I wanted in it--just as described by the seller."
2,Close but no cigar!,"Mr. Yorgason may know his Mormon history but he sure blew it with the rest of this story. His credits claim that he has degrees in history but it's more than obvious that he didn't bother to use anything he learned about researching the subject before he put this one together! He's used one reference (and we all know which one it is)without bothering to authenticate any of the details and, unfortunately, he's so far off the money that he took much more than ""literary license"" with a story that was confusing enough already. Now he'll have even more people mixed up about what happened since some obviously can't separate fact and fiction. How would Civil War buffs like it if an author moved the date of the Gettysburg fight by a month!!"
4,"Hearts Afire, Books 1 & 2","This is an excellent book and I liked the story line, but I found the author to be lacking in his ability to use simple descriptive words. This made it difficult to keep up with the story. I don't mind stretching my vocabulary some, but there were times these unusual words caused me to drift from the story. Like I said, I did like the story itself, except for the female lead character repeating her efforts to repent of her sins. It became a little boring there. But overall I give it 4 stars...A good book. I will buy book 3 when it come out."
4,Very Good,"When Randolph steps on Olivia's dress and damages it he comes face to face with his proclaimed enemy, and what a lovely face it is. When he tries to mend the breach between the families, tempers are lost and difficulties arise. As the two find themselves being drawn to one another, the whole town is being ripping apart. When the truth comes out about a murder, Olivia is afraid that Randolph and his family will seek to destroy what's left of her own.The only complaint I have with this book is at times I found it maddening the things that kept them apart, but I enjoyed this book very much. It was the first I had read of Catherine Palmer's, but it won't be the last."
1,A small LARGE,"The ad said orange large waggle. However, I think it was really a medium size. I previously purchased a large green waggle that was much bigger and harder than the orange one."
4,"Great as a tug toy, not so much as a treat dispenser","Now, my dog admittedly isn't the sharpest crayon in the box, but even with cutting the plastic nubs down on the inside of the treat balls, she could not EVER get those treats out.However, we did find that this works GREAT as a tug toy that she can't destroy! We can't do ropes or anything with any kind of fabric b/c my dog (55lb husky mix) will completely destroy & eat them, but she loves this toy more than anything. Given, it does break in half after a few months of abuse, but given that tug isn't its intended purpose, I count that as pretty good.Four stars for not doing so great at original intended function but being a great surprise tug toy."
4,My dog is too dumb for this toy,"It seems to be a decent-quality toy and it's a cute concept, but my dog has a brain the size of a raisin and couldn't figure out that 1) there was food inside and 2) how to make it come out. It's not the toy's fault. I'm considering keeping the toy and returning the dog for a refund instead."
3,Not as challenging as I thought it would be..,"Our 7 month old lab mix likes this toy, but the kibble falls out pretty easy, so it doesn't realy take her long to get it all out. Made solid though and will last a long time."
5,my standard poodle loves this thing,"It took him a while to figure out how to get the pieces of kibble out -- he's not the brightest bulb in the pack. You can trim the openings to make it easier for treats to fall out. Now that he's figured it out (his method is to lift it in the air, then drop it over and over again), I need to buy one that hasn't been trimmed. My dog prefers this waggly barbell to the stiffer barbell also made by Busy Buddy.My dogs get part of their food each day out of puzzle toys while I'm at work. My other standard poodle doesn't go for this one (or maybe the male just never lets her near it). She pushes around a Buster Cube to get her kibble, which the male has never figured out.I have 3 strong chewers but none of my dogs thought it was a chew toy."
3,Not suitable for super chewers!,"While I love the concept of this toy, my 70 pound Lab gnawed a large hole in one end of it in about an hour. He hasn't done any damage to the large Kong he's had for seven months. This Medium/Large Busy Buddy just isn't tough enough for my resolute chewer. I've uploaded a photo of the damaged Waggle."
5,Hours of Enjoyment,"This toy has provided countless hours of enjoyment for our dog. We have a 65lb labrador greyhound mix. She eats most toys and is not fond of kongs once the stuffing is out (but she is not able to eat the kongs beyond the soft puppy one). This toy is great because the hole is small, yet there are little prongs you can cut to make the toy less challenging. I think she enjoys the noise the treats make inside the balls. Larger treats of course take her longer to get out, but stuffing it with her food works just fine most of the time. She realyl enjoys all of the Busy Buddy products - Squirel Dude is great but the saucer got old quickly for her."
5,Amazingly durable,"My young lab has destroyed almost every toy put in front of her, but this toy has been the most durable we've tried. I didn't cut any of the ""fingers"" and she works relentlessly to get the treats/kibble out. When it's not full of treats, it makes a great toy to throw for her to catch, as it is soft and light, and doesn't risk injury to her teeth.I have tried nylabones, which she chews to the point of tiny, tiny slivers of it coming off, and fearing injury, I've had to discontinue using them.So pleased with this toy!"
