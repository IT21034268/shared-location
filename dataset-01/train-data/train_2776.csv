1,Good in the begining - but fell apart over time,I loved this little wonder for the first 8 months. It was great! The cofee was strong and wonderful. It wasn't too messy and it was nice being able to make a single cup of cofee.Over time it stopped working properly. When I first made coffee it would leave the coffee grounds in the little hopper almost dry from all the pressure. Now the hopper is still filled with water when it says it is done. I turned it in for warranty repair. They didn't end up fixing anything - oh and they called me to let me know that they dropped it while it was in their care so the back plate was chipped.So although it started out great - the fact that it didn't really make it a year of use means I won't be buying another Briel product anytime soon.
1,Avoid - - Unfortunately...,"Worked great in the beginning. We loved it. It did everything that everyone says about it and more. Great espresso. Great being able to make cup after cup. Then... it broke. So, I sent it back to the service company in New Jersey. They sent it back after 3 weeks. We made one cup, and then it broke again... Oh well. Luckily, we still have our old standby [$$$] Braun cap machine that I bought from Onsale Auctions a long time ago."
2,um............some like it hot,"The machine makes great tasting espresso with a very nice crema however, the coffee isn't hot. After calling the manufacturer, I found out that the coffee should be between 175-185 degrees. My husband and I tested the temperature (for 10 days straight) and discovered it was only between 150-160 degrees. I called Briel back and he said that we need to let the machine,with the filter holder in tact, warm up for 5 to 7 minutes before we make our first cup of coffee for the day. Well, we tried that and it only raised the temperature to 165 degrees. Briel said we could send it in to have the thermostat replaced however it wouldn't do any good (because it was the user's fault not the machine...???) SO...I guess we'll have to heat our espresso up in the microwave if we want hot coffee :-( - I wouldn't buy this again."
4,Fabulous espresso/cappuccino - a little messy,"We enjoyed an Il Primo for many years, but we didn't know what we were missing. This espresso is so smooth you won't believe it! The unit is not as brain-dead easy as the Il Primo, but you will be rewarded with amazing espresso and meringue-like foam. It is a bit drippy, like the other reviews said.Even in you don't buy this machine, you must get a unit with a pump and dual temperature control.Some additional hints:- Lavazza is fabulous Italian espresso. It comes pre-ground, so you don't have to worry about the coarseness of the grind.- It has a slider for the amount of coffee/espresso it makes, but keep it on the lowest setting - after the first ounce or two, all you are doing is adding bitter flavor, all the good stuff is already in the cup!If you spend more, I seriously doubt you are getting better espresso/cappuccino - just features."
2,The 1 year Machine,This was my second machine and seemed fine until it broke. I have since ordered one made by Solis... For [this price] this is not a bad machine but one year of service is not what I was hoping for. If you notice most people who rave about the Chamonix have only had it for a short time. The best test of any product is time and this one failed me. ...
4,Water droplets in the new unit is NORMAL,"This posting is primarily for people who want to buy this and are reading the reports of water condesation inside the plastic bag of the new units. THIS IS NORMAL. You just need to follow the instructions to clean the unit prior to first use.If you read the instruction manual carefully enough you will find that water condensation is the result of water pressure testing that every machine apparently goes trhough as the quality assurance. This condensation (and the high rate of incidents of the face plate falling off) can be a problem if you buy this machine as a gift for someone.Apart from those small issues, the pump, filter, filter holder, frother and all the controls (the imprtant stuff!) are as sturdy as industrial espresso units. If you buy it for yourself you'll have great espresso. (Bye-bye Starbucks, this machine pays for itself in about 3 months for me in money saved every morning at the espresso stand)"
5,"great cappucino, perfect crema, and so easy to use.","We listed this on our wish list for Christmas and were so pleased to get it as a gift. We use it weekly, clean up is a snap, and our mocha's, cappucino's and latte's are very enjoyable. Our last maker was a Krups and this Briel espresso maker tastes so much better. One added benefit is that you don't have to worry about running out of water when steaming your milk! We love it!"
5,Love this machine- 8 years and runs like new!,"I bought this machine 8 years ago for my husband, who drinks espresso about 4 times daily. We have never had a problem with it. Initially, it does take a little getting used to (like any espresso machine), but once you know how to use it, it consistently makes perfect espresso. My husband and I travel to Europe at least once a year and the espresso the Chamonix makes is comparable. It is difficult to find the parts, but once you find the order form (online or by calling Briel), then it's a piece of cake to order them. We've had to replace the filter twice. Ours came with a 10 year pump warranty but I'm not sure if they offer that anymore. Otherwise, we love this machine and recommend it to anyone who wants a pump-driven espresso machine at a great price."
4,Great low-end price machine that runs like a Timex,"I had three Krups espresso/cappuccino machines in my lifetime. They were ""okay"" but I wanted something better and purchased a refurbed Briel Chamonix 4 years ago and have no regrets.I use the machine to make espresso and cappuccino just about everyday. The only time it failed me was in the beginning when I refused to RTFM. When I did, it worked like a charm. It's easy to clean, and it does not sputter water into my milk or drip like crazy like the Krups did. It makes a terrific cup of espresso and is effective and quick at steaming milk.My only complaint is that it takes a minute or so longer than the high price machines to come up to full heat -- but for the price you can't beat it."
2,Nice Out of the Box,"Let begin by saying this is my second machine. The first machine I had, had a problem with the pump and not shooting out the right amount of espresso. I returned the machine only to find out the same machine was available for alot less money, so I bought another one. Maybe it was just a bad machine I got. I've had the current machine for about 2 months and have experienced the same issue with the pump. Briel's customer service is not very helpful. They want you to ship the machine back to them (at your cost) for them to repair it (no loaner given). Needless to say, I am doing what I can to work around this issue.Alot of the features on this espresso maker, makes this machine appealing to someone who spends $135 per month on coffee from the local coffee house. But, read all the reviews before you decide to invest in this machine..."
2,OK while it lasts,"We've had our machine for 8 months. The pump still works, the machine roars, but it doesn't push water through the right nozzle anymore (if only we could figure out a way to use the steam frother hookup to make coffee--water shoots out of there). I think, due maybe to the difficulty in descaling, that you can count on using this machine 6-9 months. Ask yourself, wouldn't I rather pay more and get one that works for a longer time? Wish I had."
2,Good for a year,"I hate to complain because the customer service people were nice, but since they can't come to my house and wave a magic wand to fix our machine I want to warn people who are thinking about buying this one that it doesn't last long. We used it, off and on, for about a year before our attempts to clean off the filter head and rinse out the machine with vinegar and or commercial machine cleaners failed. The pump still works; it's a shame to throw it away, but it doesn't make coffee so out it goes. We're buying one that costs $600 and hope that it's 600 times better."
2,Briel Chamonix,"I bought this from a 'GoldBox' deal on Amazon. I loved it - at first. Easy to use, easy to clean up. Drawbacks have been well documented - the main one for me was the low height of the brewhead - very hard to find a large enough container to capture a double shot. The unit I have died after about 6 months - no consistent steam pressure. Sometimes, it works great - most of the time, it takes 20-25 minutes to get enough steam to heat a pitcher of milk. I tried everything, from cleaning out the water feed tube, to the steam wand. No good.Luckily, I received a new higher-end machine for Christmas (Starbucks Barista). Frankly, The Briel unit looks, feels and is cheap comparably to the Barista. This would be expected for a machine 1/4 of the price. I only wish it would have worked longer, but I love my new machine! I would have given the Briel unit 4 stars had it not failed to work after six months."
1,Briel ES-35 APG Espresso (Maker?),"I was excited about this machine after reading previous reviews. Unfortunately since purchasing it, I have never had one sip of coffee come out of it. The filter holder leaks more water from all sides, than gets to the cup and then remains filled with water on top of the coffee. The mess from trying to get the machine working is entirely too time consuming. Needless to say I would not recommend it and if I still had the box I would return it. A lot of money for something that never worked once. My old ... machine is still going strong."
3,I guess it is good for about two years,"Worked great at first. Over the last two years, now having problems as noted in other reviews where it leaves water in the filter creating a mess. Now it has coffee burned on the filter housing that can't seem to be removed and leaks all over the place creating quite the artistic impression on the counter top! After about six months, it started admitting steam into the filter area when you are steaming the milk. DON'T TAKE THE FILTER OFF WHEN YOU HAVE STEAM PRESSURE BUILT UP (even when turned off) OR THE FILTER WILL BLOW OFF IN YOUR HAND SPRAYING COFFEE GROUNDS EVERYWHERE and possibly burning yourself..."
2,"the good, the bad, and the ugly",the good. It is quick. much closser to coffee shop espresso than the non pump machines.the bad. no carafe came with it. unless you have lttle short cups you are going to have to go out and buy more. coffee temp is only warm. the ammount you get out is only 1/2-2/3 what they say. only ever think of putting one cup underneath it. don't tamp the grounds too muchthe ugly. oh my gosh the mess i had when i put in too much coffee grounds and tamped it down
1,Not a good experience with the Chamonix!,"The first machine that arrived came all scratched up, so I exchanged it through Amazon. The second machine came over two weeks later, only to arrive with a broken pump. This time, Amazon returned my money and suggested I buy a different machine."
1,Save Your Money,"I bought this machine after going through several cheaper models, hoping a [price]machine would last longer. I was wrong. The machine stopped pumping a few days ago after only 1 year and I'm having trouble locating the manufacturer's website for repair information. The basket where you put the grounds has been stuck in the handle since it was new."
4,"Good machine, needs a betterr basket","This is my third Briel espresso machine. Other than gasket problems I like the products a lot. The latest machine has a basket that is smaller than the one on my previous machine, so slow to filter that I kept my old basket and got rid of the new one.I did have problems with the first machine I received (did not work) and the second (broken basket retainer) but Amazon was quick to replace the first and give me credit for the basket on the second."
2,Not worth the risk,"I got this as a gift and after two weeks I am returning it. I can't seem to get consistency from it. After reading the manufacturers recomendation of using bottled water and running 3 gallons to flush the metallic taste out, it still tasted bad. I never got the same amount of espresso when I brewed. The frother is at a very awkward angle making it difficult to froth the milk. There is also no cup included and a normal cup does not fit. I had to use a bowl to catch it. I am very disappointed that I have to return my christmas gift and will be going to Starbucks this weekend to look at their Barista models. Also if you read the reviews here, most of the positive ones come from the same reviewer. Many people indicated they had to buy another one 6 months to a year after purchasing this one. My advice, pass this one up!"
1,I Just Returned This,I ordered this machine because it sounded great - lots of features and easy to use.But when it arrived I was disappointed. It is too lightweight for everyday use and the frothing wand is very annoying.
2,"Two Units in 2 years, time for a change...","I purchased my first one just over 2 years ago. I got distracted and left it on for about1.5 hours and it never worked again. However, it had also been brewing an inconsistent volume for a few months, in spite of daily cleaning and recommended maintenance. So I thought I would try again since I had saved hundreds of dollars by avoiding Starbucks.Number two arrived and I was obviously excited. But alas, the coffee holder leaked. No problem - I used the one from my old machine. So a few weeks ago, again, the volume of coffee becomes inconsistent. But I figure after spending $300 on two units, I could work with it. Well wouldn't you know it, I left it on again today - close to 2 hours. And when I went to make coffee, it spewed steam everywhere. Argh! Since I make at least 2 cups a day, I need to find a reliable machine and I'm fairly certain this one isn't it."
1,"Easy initial setup, bad quality coffee + hard handling","When we bought the machine we were hoping for something easy to setup, but make decent coffee.The first is true, it's not that difficult. However, you run into numerous problems pretty quickly.1) Attaching the coffee filter is hard. Only after a little while I figured out that you can only put so much coffee into it, that you can still attach it.2) Only very small cups fit.3) Amount of espresso made is inconsistent. Sometimes it fills the entire cup, sometimes only 1/3 of it.4) Espresso brew runs over, by the filter. Even after adjusting. Adjusting the filter we lost the screw, we are truly ""screwed"" now. Already sent mail to Brittax, haven't heard back.5) The extra coffee runs into the container below, needs to continuously be cleaned.6) Today the steaming valve started leaking, water running out of it at a constant drip while brewing espresso.If there is/would be a way to return this machine after 2 months of usage I will."
2,Ruined by Sticker!,"This was my birthday gift and we had to wait three weeks for it to arrive, even though it was supposedly ""in stock"". When it finally arrived, the manufacturer had stuck a large sticker on the unit right below where the coffee comes out. When we tried to peel it off, we could never get all of the sticky goop off of the plastic no matter what we tried (hot soap and water, rubbing alcohol, etc.) We are returning it since it is an unsanitary and sticky mess. Also, there was a human hair in the water resovoir when we took it out of the plastic wrapping. Pretty disgusting! Our advice is to pass this one up unless you like gross sticky stuff and someone else's hair in your espresso! Yuck!"
1,"One year later, it no longer works","When I was preparing to replace my little old braun espresso machine, I thought I did a good job of research. I read many reviews, talked to people, looked at many different models and finally landed on this one. What an improvement it was at first. It made a controlled amount of coffee and steamed milk very nicely . It did have a little water dripping from the steam wand when not in use, but the owners manual said a few drops of water were to be expected. After seven or eight months of once or twice daily use, I noticed that the steam pressure for steaming milk seemed to be waning. Shortly thereafter, I noticed a small steam leak coming from the inside of the machine.I still make coffee, although it isn't doing that as well either, but I have not steamed any milk for a while and am looking hard to find a new machine that will be more reliable."
2,Poor Durability,"Worked great out of the box, although the electronic controls were erratic and hard to set. Made good espresso.However, after about 18 months, I have to throw it away and buy something else. It is gradually self-destructing."
2,Not the quality you might expect,"We received the product in battered manufacturer's container. The unit is made of non-sturdy plastic. We found that the steamer wand is so close to the base and your counter-top, making it difficult to swirl the wand while steaming milk. We will purchase a higher quality unit that is heavier, since this one requires two hands and a firm grasp to lock the coffee scoop into the unit. It will require us to pay return shipping for the experience of looking at this product. I will think twice about buying a product of this type again from Amazon without actually seeing one. Finally, the actual machine we received was marked ES-35F, NOT the ES35APG as advertised in the product description...difference??? Who knows."
5,A Little Bit of Europe at Home.,This an excellant machine. It makes the task of making a fine cup of Espresso a breeze. It creates Espresso with the quality that you would expect to find in a cafe in Europe. I wish other products were as easy as this machine to operate.
1,Expected too much for so little.,"I knew when we purchased this machine it would be a dream come true if it could last for any decent length of time. In the beginning it was great but as time past the machine seemed to have more difficulty pushing the water through the coffee. I've followed the directions to no avail, opening the steam valve over and over, turning the pump on and off, even releasing the filter holder to release the so called ""air lock"" condition this machine seems so prone to. Now it takes just as long as getting dressed and walking over to the local java house. They may boast a ten year warranty on the pump but the bottom line is the pump is just plain weak.This machine has paid for itself but the fact remains...you get what you pay for. I am now contemplating our next espresso machine purchase."
2,Very Poorly Made Machine,"I bought this machine in November 2001 based largely on the positive reviews here but since then I've noticed that most of the positive reviews of the Briel Chamonix are from customers who have only had it a few days or weeks. My machine worked great for a few weeks. It made excellent espresso and produced a lot of steam. Unfortunately, after a couple months, it started to leak. Not a few drops either. Streams of water run out of every opening and flood my countertop. Then the steamer stopped working. Today, 9 months and numerous replacement parts/repairs later, I finally gave up and bought a new one from Starbucks. I used my old Starbucks machine for 7 years before I ""upgraded"" to the Briel and I never had a problem with it. The construction was exceptional and the customer service unbeatable. The Briel machine is going in the trash. :-("
1,Briel ES35AB,"I bought this espresso maker last Christmas and it worked fine for about 6 months, when is started to have problems: leaking frothing nose, pressure lost. I sent it in for repair and worked fine for about 2 more months. Now is broken again, same problem. I am tired of it. Don't buy it, is not worth the money."
2,"Looked promising, but it was a disappointment","I finally decided to replace my 10+ year old Braun Espresso maker and chose this one after the good reviews I read. Unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to its promise. The pump doesn't deliver the right amount of water most of the time. I finally decided to return it after I ran through four pump cycles to get the amount of water I expect to get out of one cycle (sometimes it works right). I've read the directions and I don't believe I'm doing anything wrong. I also don't think the machine is necessarily defective, just of questionable quality. I'll be looking for a different brand next time."
5,Excellent quality for a low price!,"When I bought the Viridian Collection of Baccano for such a low price, I was not certain if the quality would be good or not because I have never seen this series be sold for less than $30. When I played it, however, it was proven that the quality of the series is excellent. As such, I would recommend that people buy the Viridian Collection of Baccano. It is an excellent anime to be viewed, and for such a low price, that makes it even better!"
4,Great... but gory,"This series is incredibly original. It is also horrifically gruesome and, at times, psychotically dark. There are no main characters and the entire series focuses on a singular event. However Baccano pulls off this complicated ballet of blood, guts, and story telling in a way that is both addicting and intriguing."
5,English dub is so worth it... most certainly will buy,"This series has enough interesting plot, visuals, and music to offer that I won't relate it all to you here, but know that buying this series is certainly going to be worth the price of its localization: the English dub cast is phenomenal, and perfectly matched for each character. I mean, who doesn't want a 1930s era anime set in America to be done in full American accents? It's pretty sweet.I've never been one to buy box-sets brand new or for full price, but I am definitely saving up for this one!Edit:Got this boxset a while ago and am still loving it! It's a well priced and boxed release, with lovely character art on each thin-pack case in the set. I always recommend it to friends."
3,Baccano! on DVD,"Don't get me wrong on the three stars, ""Baccano!"" is an amazing anime. It was written almost as a monument to how much more interesting non-linear stories can be than linear stories.The reason why I only gave this product three stars is because of the surprisingly low video quality. Admittedly, it's probably no lower than the quality of any stream you could find of the show, but it is a lot more obvious the second that it hits the TV. I can't imagine that ""Baccano!"" was actually originally animated at this terribly low resolution, so it makes me wonder why the DVD release is so low quality.If you are looking to buy anime series for a more visual experience of them, you'd be better off just streaming this. Otherwise, go for it!"
5,Great and very necessary Wisdom!,"An open mind and heart are required to ""get"" the information Mr. Icke presents in his books and DVD's. But, when checked out, his knowledge is beyond reproach and very enlightening. Those who don't get it are obviously still into manipulation and not ready for freedom of mind and spirit. The closed minded are unfortunately playing into the hands of the very people (and I use the term lightly) that Mr. Icke exposes."
1,Oh dear,"This man saw ""V"" on late night TV in the UK and spun a career out of it. Thank goodness he didn't watch Doomwatch. And you've got to love the people who believe this nonsesne who tell us that we deny these lunatic ramblings because we are still under Reptilian ""manipulation"". That's priceless. If you believe the ravings of a loon, you are enlightened. If you denounce the irrational nature of everything these people say, then you are still under the control of some secret society run by anoles and skinks.I'm staying on the side of ratioanilty thank you all the same."
1,ColverPA,"This book was awful. Hard to read, nothing happens. Characters are dull and the story moves soooooo slow. You keep thinking that something must happen on the next page, but it never does.Story is unbelievable and stupid. Adjectives, adjectives, adjectives, adjectives. Woods, woods, woods. It's like plowing through quicksand. ""Alice in Wonderland"" had more suspense and horror."
2,My first taste of Ramsey Campbell was a disappointment,"I had heard that Ramsey Campbell wrote in the Jamesian (M.R.) tradition so I eagerly purchased The Darkest Part of the Woods hoping to have found a new author to feed my addiction to that particular kind of creepiness. The book started out with promise, although the dialogue seemed a little contrived and so were the characters, yet I held onto hope that the story would pick up. Indeed there were moments at the beginning of the book where it seemed as if Campbell was ready to deliver the goods, but as the chapters moved on, instead of building horror, the book waded into plodding chapters of boring inner-familial conversations full of imprecise reminiscences, all of which threw a wet blanket over any malevolent threats or horror the author was attempting to establish. When I found myself skipping over pages and pages of dialogue between flatly-drawn sisters, I knew it was over."
1,Too slow and full of characters I didn't care about,I picked this book up in the library expecting because it seemed to have similar elements to a book I am writing. Hopefully my book won't come out this way. Cambell spends far too much time showing us the inner workings of a family we don't particularly care about and not enough time building our interest in what is in the woods. I didn't even stick around to find out.
1,A slow walk to nowhere.,That is what this book should have been called. Reading it is like a very slow walk to nowhere.
1,Oh God this was the most horrible story ever WRITTEN,"I have never in my life read a more BORING, POINTLESS work of fiction. You will find yourself utterly befuddled when trying to follow the poor wording and punctuation of this story. The plot is MIND NUMBING, and of course I have to finish it because I am compelled to finish every story I begin reading. I wish I could find it in myself to light this on fire and put the ashes in my cat's litterbox but that won't happen for another one hundred agonizing pages at least. RUN THE OTHER WAY while you still have the chance, friends! Use the five or six bucks you would have spent on this paperback to buy some toilet paper instead, I promise it will be more interesting!"
5,"slow, odd , beautiful and really, really creepy","Like Heather Price, the main character in this novel, I started out in denial of the power of The Darkest Part of the Woods. The pacing was slow, the literary conceits seemed obvious, the characters acted tranquilized. But eventually, I became obsessed with the woods and I continued to think about (be haunted by?) this novel long after I finished reading it. The reviewer who complained about Campbell's over-use of forest imagery missed the point. The woods are a camouflage; it's the darkness that holds the power. This is a difficult book, and I understand why the reviews are so polarized. But I thought it great and seriously disturbing."
3,You get what you pay for!,The product is OK and works fine. I prefer and use my (really) old electric clippers. They cut closer. They are also made in the USA !
3,It does the job...kind of,"These clippers are okay for the price. They get the job done, but not very efficiently. Also, they're very noisy."
4,Solid Product,"Good pair of clippers, haven't had any problems, well worth the money I've saved by cutting my own hair with these."
1,ME VINO DAÑADA,"me vino dañada la unidad donde se colocan las hojillas no corta y hace bastante ruido como si no fuese una maquina nueva.Atentamente,Saul Diaz"
5,great clips,"Great quality, quiet clipper! We have been through many clippers and this by far is the best for cost and quality."
3,Terrible Retailer,I have trouble reviewing this product because I was sent the wrong item. The retailer's communication skills are practically nonexistent! I returned the wrong item per their instructions weeks ago and have heard nothing from them since! I am sure that the actual product is quality but avoid this retailer no matter how much money you might save!
4,Want a detailed description of a snow-banner? the nut-pine?,"Or numerous other natural phenomena? Come browse Muir's collection of books. Yes, browse the 1,030 pages which comprise his writings. This book is excellent for the student of nature because his descriptive writing takes you to the high Sierra, the redwood forests, the 1,000 mile trek through Florida to the Gulf of Mexico. You are there and you want to be THERE! While much of the description was written over 100 years ago, the magnificence of a Sequoia, the humidity of a Florida swamp and the curiosity of a Douglas squirrel is still REAL today. A true travelogue for nature lovers and mountainmen wannabes alike"
5,Countless $$ saved drilling out cylinder head bolt on Diesel jetta,"A few weeks ago I bought a Jetta diesel as a project car for really cheap, as it had needed a new head gasket. The only catch: A stripped headbolt. The bolt was their special triple square design. I could have used a stud extractor if the space around it would have allowed: It did not. I decided to drill off the head, but had very poor results with some dewalt bits. I got these, and while working, periodically backed it out to eject all the metal shavings, and sprayed WD40 in the hole. When I was finished, the bit looked almost like new, just barely worn through the TiN coating on a few spots on the tip. Job well done, it'll live to drill another day. Thanks, Bosch, for an awsome drill bit. Save the other brands for the non-important jobs, bosch is the only brand I trust to do critical work!"
1,When they were Austrian steel and made in America ... they were decent .... Today???,"Bits break with the first use, even in soft woods, And, no ... the drill was not held improperly or twisted, plumb and level ... and I am not speaking of the smaller diameters. These bits are, basically worthlessand should be sold, solely, at Harbor Freight.I take that back, even their Chinese junk is not as bad as this Chinese junk.I have long been a Bosch fan, I have their 12 inch slider,several of their drills/impacts, jobsite radio, cordless oscillating tool, Colt palm router and many of their 12v subcompact stuff. Perhaps, they're not Festool quality, but they're OK.These bits? Described above (worthless) and a huge waste of your money."
3,Not made in USA,"Have not used them yet, but be clear these are Chinese, not American.Will update stars once tested.They are sharp and straight and well packaged,"
3,item delivered not as pictured,"It may be worth knowing that ordering this set of bits results in a delivery of a set that is different than the picture shown in the item description. Actual case is a longer rectangle shape. I haven't used the bits yet, they look like good quality."
1,NOT made in USA,"Haven't used the bits yet. Decided to purchase them because origin was listed as USA. When I received them, the package said Made in China. Very disappointed that I was misled."
1,Very disappointed,"The very first time I used the 5/16"" drill bit, it snapped into. I believe these are made from recycled steel. If this was made from solid steel, it never would have broken. I agree with the other guy when he said they probably would be good to be used for aluminium or wood.I am going to Sears or some other company to find a quality set that will last."
1,This book is a bad influence,"My daughter loves this book, but I hate it. It shows pictures of a little girl standing in a potty, and with a potty on her head. The accompanying text says that this is not what you do, but the pictures are compelling. AFter reading this book, my daughter started standing in the potty, saying ""no, no, no!"" I think the book would be a lot better if it only showed positive pictures."
4,"Finally a potty book for the ""rest"" of us","Why are all potty books illustrated with white/pink girls?? Finally, here is a potty book for the rest of us, one that shows children who look like *my* kids learning to use the potty."
2,Boat on the road,"This product just doesn't adequately secure a boat to the cartop. The foam blocks tend to slip along the kayak, causing them to loosen, and only one strap is provided to strap the boat to the roof when two are really necessary. At the very least, it should include two roof-to-car straps. Also, the foam blocks should have a larger surface area to keep from causing a buckle in larger-span roofs like vans."
3,Could have been a very good book.,"This could have been a very good book. There are some great photos. Houses I haven't seen in other books. But. . .There are some great captions that are poorly represented by the photos. Some of the photos are so poorly laid-out that it is hard to tell it is supposed to be two separate photos. House drawings that don't show features mentioned in the description -- where is the other bathroom that was mentioned?If you want to use this as a guide for designing a natural home, choose another book."
1,What An Idiot,"This idiot says ""free X-Raided"". Funny thing is that if it had been your grandmother who got capped you would be whistling a different tune. Anyone ever consider this scumbag went to jail for murdering somebody's grandmother? I guess I'm doing it all wrong....maybe I need to go cap someone's family member, make an album in prison over the phone, and then become rich. Too bad the only thing I'd be able to spend my money on would be ramen noodles and soap on a rope."
1,Tender Ballads about Chaste Young Lovers,"This is truly refreshing in today's sordid cultural climate: Here we have a nice young man who resists the blandishments of the modern popular music industry, defies the trend machine, and bravely sings heartfelt songs about the poignant memories of a young man's first love, the chaste kind of love one feels for an idealized beauty whom we revere as the embodiment of all our noblest longings. The solicitous way young Mr. Raided sings of the fairer sex brings a tear to my eye. I had thought such tender decencies had long ago fled this harsh world, but this fine young gentleman has proved me wrong and restored my faith in the young people of today. Unfortunately, I must subtract four stars from my five-star review because I detected a few stylistic infelicities that, here and there, tarnish his otherwise fine tenor singing voice. But I'm sure that with maturity and experience, he will grow up to become one of our most inspiring musical artists."
1,Prevent Those Ugly Rings...,...from forming on your hardwood coffee table by using this CD as a coaster for those frosty mugs. I got this album at the bargain bin for 20 cents...and it was worth every penny spent. Now my coffee table is protected. (You can always remove the lurid booklet if you don't want to be staring at this guy's ugly mug.)
1,I have a $600 coffee maker because the espresso stopped ....,...I have a $600 coffee maker becaue the espresso side stopped working after five cups of espresso. It wont heat the water and starts pumping cold water as soon as you turn it on. Besides that the frother spits water! I will except the first offer of $250 for it.jazzcatlewis@home.comI also have the Briel Portafila and it works fine.
2,Plastic Parts Warp,"I purchased this machine last year for Christmas. It worked well for about 6 months. The plastic interior parts warp and create problems. It will no longer brew a full cup of coffee. Also, the lid warped. Replacement parts cannot be purchased. The machine must be returned to New Jersey for warranty work. Based on the cost of the coffee maker, this seems to be very poor quality."
3,Troublesome machine,"I purchased the Briel as an upgrade from a Capresso espresso maker that was giving me a lot of trouble. I am sorry to say the Briel has joined the ranks as well. I am experiencing the same problems as the last reviewer whose machine stopped brewing full cups of espresso after about 6 months. After calling the Briel customer service line, they speculated that my filter holder must be clogged and are supposedly sending me replacements (I had to pay for them of course). He claimed that this fixes the problem in about 90% of the cases but I amanxious to see if it does. My machine also drips water continuously from the frother. I would say that if you are a novice with low expectations, this machine might be fine. But a friend of mine has a basic model Saeco that I think makes much better espresso with more crema. I wouldn't spend the $$ on this machine again."
3,Reservations,"Arrived in time as a x-mas gift to the wife, who has evinced an interest in a pro-quality espressso machine. Since our drip coffee maker had just failed, it seemed an excellent choice. And we were certainly pleased with the appearance and obvious quality of the Briel. One caveat: it was inoperative - no lights, no sound, not even coffee. It has been returned with refund requested(to a high-end mail-order catalog). Another irritating feature was the instruction booklet which reminds one of the 60's era of Japenese manuals. Not being familiar with espresso brewers, we both felt that it would take a bit of experimentation to become proficient. But after reading the reviews & comments on your web site, we are considering ordering a new unit(at considerable savings)..."
1,"Nice, but more for show than use","My wife purchased this for me a year ago and that is the only reason it has not been replaced.It lacks enough power to make more than one espresso per two or three minutes and the coffer brews hot but has never maintained a reasonable temperature. It is silly to have to microwave a cup of coffee out of the pot.I called the Briel support and it was far less than expected. They dismissed my concern over the low coffee temperature (130 degrees) and told me to keep adjusting and cleaning the espresso cup, which I did at length before the call.If you want a combo unit for show, this is fine. If you want to have espresso more that every few weekends, but something nicer."
2,Problems with Briel,"I have owned two Briel coffeemakers, and both had problems. This model never pumped the water correctly. We now have a lower model, and the coffeemaker top broke almost instantly and the top of the entire unit never sat right - water leaks out. The systems look great and the espresso part was perfect, but overall, we were very disappointed."
2,BEWARE of BAD machine,"great looking machine! when it works. Briel DOES NOT exchange machines if not working. I don't know where you live but the only service is NJ. You pay shipping one way. When this machine works its good, but when the filter is stuck in the machine. let me tell you it gets hot and water collects on the top of the espresso, so when you can finnally get it out the hot water burns you. I'm out $450 for the machine and still awaiting the return from NJ. Cross your fingers for me. I hope it's fixed."
3,Heating element kaput after 4 months,"This Briel unit seemed to meet all of our needs. However, when I tried to find it online for the lowest price, it seemed that the manufacturer was having trouble supplying its distributors. So, right off the bat, it was hard to get.The features did meet out needs...while it worked. Some of the switchgear and controls feel a little imprecise, however. After 4 months of modest use, the heating element on the drip coffee side failed. Briel customer service is apparently provided by a gruff bunch of commercial appliance repair people in NJ...a phone call to them was like conversing with stunt doubles from The Sopranos.When it worked, it was fine. I just wouldn't expect a $600 (yes, at the time, that was the best price we could get) unit like this to fail so fast."
1,What the heck happened here?,"While you can see where they were trying to go with Starfleet Command 3, it doesn't cut the mustard. They tried to simplify the game and bring in people who didn't want to learn the complex command of the first two StarFleet Commands. While the idea is admirable, they've failed miserably.Not all is lost, there are some nice touches, the new ships from the Next Generation era, and things like Warp Speed actually doing something.Unfortunately, this isn't enough to make me ditch my SFC II."
4,An important REVIEW by a trekkie,"Starfleet Command 3, this game has great graphics, but after an extended campaign it freezes and you have to rebut your PC. It also has an extra which enables you to custumize your own ship this is new.The game has great battles and fun and exciting levels that were well thought out. There our two ways to play the star empires own campaign, or conquest the galaxy this one you can have people join your fleet. Also there is a one on one battles on Dynaverse{internet}. cAptain Picard briefs you on the missions. Its a wonderfull game set in the Next Generation era, and no more stupid missiles either. It is a must buy."
1,If I only knew,"If I only knew what I was buying, I would have given the money to a charity. No, not to a charity, to the first person I meet on the street.It took me about 3 hours to understand that that was it, this WAS the game, and I was not going to get anything else. By that time my eyes were closing and I was falling asleep.This is what you do in the game - you listen to endless and pointless conversations directing you to do something, you go and do it, and when all of a sudden time comes to shoot, you shoot and run and shoot and run and turn and shoot and run and shoot and run and shoot and turn and run and shoot and run and run and run and shoot and shoot and shoot and turn and run.This game cannot be called strategic, because you are totally limited in choices, it cannot be called arcade because it is not only slow, there is no word in the language to say how slow it is. What kind of game is it?? I don't know..."
1,Too Many Bugs!,"This game is full of bugs, even after the latest patch. Gameplay is simply ruined by all of progamming flaws, such as lock-ups. Even some game objectives are dead ends. Some missions on this game are unconquerable thanks to the poor programming. [its not worth the price that i paid and is not worth considerably less]"

3,Cute necklace..get what you pay for.,"Of all of the items I have purchased from Eves Addition, this is my least favorite. I wasn't impressed with the quality, just kinda feels cheap.Its cute and was a nice price, but I would pay higher for a better quality."
5,"Extreme cuteness, a pinch of comedy & an unexpected surprise...","WOW!!! The fourth and final installment of this outstanding anime series blows them all out of the water. The evil Byoh have came to Okashima City in search of Taruto. The final hour approaches, while friendships will soar and all will be revealed. Is Taruto the Princess of the Kinka? I'm not telling :)If you like...Cutesy anime...cat-girls(Nekos)...magical adventures...then what are you waiting for? Magical Meow Meow Taruto is definitely a worthy addition to your collection. It has a rating of 7 and up and I am 34. I dearly love this series and I highly recommend it. Especially if you have kids."
3,Scottish Clan and Family Names,I was a little disappointed in the book. It just didn't give me the information I was hoping for. I was looking for more information on my family name of Duncan
3,Nice fit,"This is a very nice, quality sandal. The soles are a bit cheap. This makes them a little uncomfrtable. Overall, nice product for the price."
2,Can't find his energy,"I met Rolling Thunder in 1979 and what was immediately noteworthy about him was his incredible charisma. His energy seemed to fill the arroyo where he was staying, and it felt rumbling, like rolling thunder. I had hoped the video might capture some of his energy, depth and charm as a keep sake of my meeting with him. Unfortunately, it didn't."
2,NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATION NOVELS,"I loved the foundations novels, including the three post-Asimov novels. However, I found Psychohistorical Crisis extremely difficult to follow. It seems to be taking place in four different periods, whIch I found to be a gimmick and very confusing. I did not recognize anything familiar from the original or three post-Asimov novels. I really could not understand what was happening after the first chapter. For those who like novels with clarity and easily defined protagonists and antagonists combined with a linear plot, this is not for you."
3,A Good Novel..but no continuation from the Foundation Series,This novel was a very good book to read and I was highly anticipating the book since hearing that Mr. KingsBury was going to be the author. But... the book had seemingly dumped the entire end of Foundation and Earth and removed the Gaia factor that was present there. As I stated before a good novel to read but I found follow through from the original series to this one very poor.
1,Immensely Irritating - Absolutely Hated It,"Trying to read this book drove me absolutely nuts. While I realize the author changed the names to avoid copyright infringement, it still was extremely irritating. Splendid Wisdom, Harry Seldom, and Cloun - give me a break! Reading this book was like trying to program a computer while fighting off food poisoning. Every so often, you get hit with a bad ""something's not right; I feel queasy!"" feeling. He may have had some good ideas in here, but I got so disgusted I quit after about 30 pages."
1,Dull and pointlessly vulgar.,"I find Asimov's writing style tedious, but this was worse. Good ideas gone bad, kind of thing.And maybe these are supposed to be post-humans in the distant future, but reading about a 14 year old's sexual activities just doesn't do it for me."
4,A re-imagined future of the Foundation,"There may be fans of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series who think that its integration with his Robot novels was a crowning achievement. I am not one of those fans, and apparently neither is Donald Kingsbury, the author of Psychohistorical Crisis. Over a thousand years after the end of Asimov's original trilogy (Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), Kingsbury resumes the story during a crisis period of the Second Empire. The preservation of civilization once again depends on human ingenuity and insight (aided by the mathematics of psychohistory), not on manipulation by robotic protectors. I found Psychohistorical Crisis to be much more satisfying as a continuation of the original Foundation series than any of Asimov's later novels. It gets four stars due to the rushed ending. I only wish Kingsbury had taken more time, and maybe a hundred more pages, to finish."
3,If you are keen on Asimov's foundation series this is a must read.,"As a kid I really enjoyed the orginal foundation series. I then enjoyed several books that Asimov wrote on the same theme.As such I was quite keen to read this book.Unlike many such books written by writer on a fiction subject that someone else wrote, this writer obviously does know the early books by Asimov well. As such this book is what Asimov should have written to complete his series.I do confess that I would have prefered a shorter book as I thought it was too long. Also more details on psychohistory in the context of the foundation series maybe the writer could not do this as in later books in the series Asimov gave up on the idea being possible. Lastly I would have liked more on the game at the end."
5,What the world has been waiting for!,"If you are the parent or educator of a child with autism, this book should be required reading! Well-written and informative both the professional and the non-professional alike can learn so much from this multi-disciplinary approach to treating this difficult and heartwrenching disorder. Edited by two esteemed and experienced professionals, this book answers any questions you may have, and even questions you never would have thought to ask. I cannot more highly recommend this book!"
1,Great for Little Dogs...NOT Tough,This is not a tough toy. My dog ate it in less than an hour...very big waste of money.
1,Extremely dangerous! Do Not Purchase!,"Immediately after giving this ""toy"" to my german shepherd, his lower jaw became ensnared in the lattice opening, resulting in a 10 minute frenzy of his screaming in pain and me trying to loosen the rubber around his jaw enough to release him from it. His canine teeth were inside the ball, and he was frantic! The rubber is so hard I couldn't stretch it over his teeth, and he thrashed and screamed the entire time I tried to remove it. I finally calmed him down enough to stick my finger on his tongue and gently help him back out of it. Unacceptable. Returning it the same day it arrived."
4,Its ok,Its a good product. Our bulldogs love hollee rollers! One of the few toys they cannot destroy right away. The picture is a lil disapointing. It looks smaller then it is.I also did not realize this was a product made in CHINA :( that's rather disapointing. We do not knowingly purchase made in China toys or treats for our dogs ever.
2,Not as indestructible as I need,"I guess our boy has razors for teeth, as I have only had luck so far with the Nylabone products. He was ripping pieces of this off and of course trying to swallow them, after 15 minutes, oh, well, the search continues..."
3,Black is not my dog's favorite color,"This toy is ""okay"". My dog is a mega-chewer and he hasn't bitten through this. But, then again, it doesn't hold his attention long enough to do so. The holes are very large, which makes it easy to grasp and carry, but they are too large to hold any of his treats and my dog is quite partial to treat-bearing balls. The description reads that the colors vary. I got a black ball. Kind of ugly and that color certainly doesn't help to get the dog curious enough to play with it on his own - especially if it doesn't hold treats."
1,Lasted less than 30 minutes.,"My lab was very excited to receive this toy and it was fun to play together with it but he is a heavy chewer and within half an hour he had completely demolished it. If your dog has a reputation for chewing I would not recommend this toy. Despite the claims, it is not durable."
3,"Good to put treats in, Otherwise dog is uninterested","Unfortunately this toy hasn't made the cut of the top toys for our 50lb lab. He wasn't interested in playing with it alone, so we really only use it to put treats in. That said, due to how big the holes can be (the holes differ in size) we can only put treats that just fit in the large holes, and smaller and they come out so easily. We use the Milkbone Medium sized bones for this. We still prefer Kongs for stuffing treats in though. And I will say that we have had several JW brand dog toys and I guess we should be grateful that our dog doesn't chew on this one because he has chewed through just about all other JW toys."
5,Dog loves this,My dog got 3 new toys today and she LOVES this one. She eats through anything and many 'tough' toys last 15 minutes out of the package. 3 hours of serious chewing/playing and this is fully intact. Great for hanging on with teeth & paws. Strong yet safely pliable material. Good for shaking. She's really enjoying this toy. Hope it last.
4,holds up well,"I have a lab- 9 months old. I don't leave her alone all day with this toy but she does like it (and has liked it since she was very young). It has held up when several other toys have not. I really liked it for on my porch where smaller balls would slip through the railing, this one is big enough to not fall through but still fun."
2,Not for a chewer,"I didn't even leave my dog alone with this, I was sitting right there with him, tossing the ball down the hallway and he brought it back to me broken. I just let him destroy it, took about 3 minutes. I like JW Pet products usually but not this one. Also it's pretty big if I remember right, larger than a softball."
4,Holl-MollEE!,I have two very aggressive chewers. Toys usually do not last longer than 30 minutes with either of them. I bought two of these balls a month ago and they are both still like new.
1,Lovely hummer,"First of all my son loved this toy, NOT!!!! This toy was a disgraceto the boy world. My son loved Hummers until I bought this toy for him. This toy goes so slow even though it says it goes really fast. This toy went like two stupid miles per hour. I am really warning all of you guardians or siblings out their never ever buy this stupid hummer toy ever!"
2,Wow. It's Great! NOT!,"i purchased this for about 30 dollars and i thought i was gonna love it. Before i even played with it, i needed 6 AA batteries. So i got 6 rechargeable ones. I charged the batteries and started to play with it. I like it alot but then, it wouldn't go on my grass lawn! so then i decided i hated it. i took it apart to see if i could turn a switch or someting to make it go faster. i took it all apart and the put it under my bed. the next day, it was gone.Pros-NoneCons-It sucks"
4,Vacpan works,"The Vacpan central vac attachment worked well. Unfortunately, the original (5 years old) broke. I was able to replace it without too much difficulty. It works great."
3,TOP-NOTCH PRIVATE EYE PROGRAM,Magnum pi was for me one of the best programs on television in the 1980's. I remember seeing this particular episode not too long ago on t.v and i liked the fact it took place out of the Hawiil setting into London. All i remeber this was a fast paced episode like all the other ones and the most memorable as well.
5,Important book,"This book is a valuable resource about on-going electoral fraud in America. And, as Miller indicates in the subtitle of his book, this fraud will continue unless we enact legislative fixes required to preserve democracy. Read this book and take some action if you don't want to be fooled a third time."
2,geeb us a brek,"I found it partisan, disingenuous at times, really depressing and with a tendency to frost the cake when making accusations. Felt similar to listening to a liberal version of Rush Limbaugh."
3,"Provocative and Intriguing, yet a bit heavy handed","If the author's premise that voting integrity in America has been compromised is true, citizens should be outraged with the misconduct and demand satisfaction. The book itself seems to struggle with it's own identity; the author loses scope when identifying the misdeeds of the incumbent party, and sums himself up best with his own quote, ""The book is a farrgo of half-truths, selective evidence and dark insinuations, making an absurd but by-and-large coherent case - and one rendered dramatically enough to garner a broad readership and arm the propagandists for the endless fight."""
2,A mile wide and an inch deep,"If you're a ""member of the choir"" and enjoy righteous indignation this book is for you. A well documented compendium of violations, abuses and near-abuses perpetrated by the right during the run-up to the 2004 presidential election. It contains some important information. You'll read both about evidence of widespread ballot tampering and the expulsion of democrats from Bush campaign events (shocked, SHOCKED!), all presented with the same seriousness. There is litte of importance here that has not been reported elsewhere so if you have been paying attention to the media (beyond the ""mainstream"" sources) this book will be a re-hash. If you are an Independent concerned about the integrity of our electoral system pass this one by."
2,A Media Critic knows Political Science?,"Mark Crispin Miller taught at The Johns Hopkins University during my undergraduate years. His courses, in the Writing Seminars Department, included ""Films of the Seventies"" and ""The Films of Stanley Kubrick."" So when and where did he acquire the knowledge and scholarly skills necessary to research and write a non-fiction book dealing with the 2004 Election?Although Mr. Miller is an excellent writer and can definitely turn a pharse, he lacks the intellectual heft necessary for a Political Science author. Perhaps he ought to return to his trained profession and leave politics to the professionals."
4,THIS SERIES WAS CANCELED BY THE PUBLISHER,"I just wanted to let people know that may think about buying this book and the second one that was released NOT TO. The series was canceled and it would have been much longer than just the two books that came out, so unless you like to not know the end of a story save your money.I think that AMAZON should be ashamed of themselves for selling this book at full rate when should it be on super clearance. I know that some people here might think that would be a good idea but I found it to be an enjoyable read. Sad to say we will never know the end."
2,"Very ""Dusty "" plot","As a veteran Fantasy fan, I got tired of this storyline years ago. The hero (or heroine, in this case) sets off traveling the world and gathering companions in a quest to save the world from the forces of darkness and evil. From ""The Lord of the Rings"" to ""Star Wars"", its been done to death. This is book one, so it mainly just sets the stage and introduces the characters. I expect book two will see the heroes barely avoiding disaster only to triumph in book three. As another reviewer said, if I read the follow-up books, I'll plan to borrow them from the library. Like many of its predecessors, the story seems to drag on and on. I prefer my fiction with a little more hope and optomism."
2,Typos,"I was surprised at the many typos in this book. Some were valid words, but not in the right context. We instead of He, No instead of So, etc. And it wasn't just in one spot, but thru a lot of it. Even things like ""E"" instead of ""I""...not good at all. Made me question a lot of sentences."
5,Good Stuff,I'm a chemical sensitive asthmatic and this does not make me sick. Bonus points for a nice clean smell and earth friendly ingredients.
2,Acorn Media provides a censored product,"Listen up everyone... This DVD set is a censored version of the original series that ran on the CBC. I have seen un-cut episodes and eps from this set and there is a LOT of scenes missing and the annoying muting of swearing and other ""off-color"" language. God forbid we hear language that real adults use... I am extremely displeased with this DVD set because I love this show so much!Give us an un-cut version!!!!"
4,da vincis inquest theme cd,"Is there just a CD of the background music of Da Vinci's Inquest - would like for work --having problems getting response on website - Love the show - in reference to someone asking about why it wasn't shown in US - well at prime time - someone had mentioned the competiveness of the companies in the US - where Canada and their entertainment shows such as this are financed thru certain agencies or similar in their government. I found I had to do a manual time set on my recorder - as I was missing out on bits, rather then setting by show title itself. Decided not to download as I want to play music at work - and in car."
5,AS GOOD AS TV GETS,"What a fine show. The strong acting, the no-cheap-shots writing and the brilliant casting make for engrossing entertainment. The setting, Vancouver, is gorgeous and sleazy but not distracting. Without car chases and gun battles the show makes the viewer abhor violent crime but does not deny the fascination we have for what us human beings do to each other. Most of the major characters are government employees, and there's a running theme of politics and bureaucracy which rings true. My only complaint is that I've got the series musical theme stuck in my brain, a jazz trumpet thing that is terrific. A minor price to pay for some worthwhile time in front of the tube."
5,Hooked on Da Vinci's Inquest,"I recently (in the last 2 months) have been an avid, every-week-day-plus-Sunday-1:35am watcher of this Incredible Series. (I fortunately have TiVo so can record the ""noontime"" broadcasts) I notice that some of the language, specific words have been ""blanked"" out. Now I know why!!Thank you so much, everyone for writing about the differences between the DVD versions. And due to your comments, I've purchased the Alliance, 2003, (Complete Season One) version ($20 or so) and can't wait to get it home and see the REAL THING. And like everyone else, am anxiously waiting for any further seasons to come out on DVD."
1,Product Defective,"This DVD does NOT represent the ""COMPLETE First Season."" This product is defective in failing to include Part 2 of the last episode in the first season. You are left with a cliff hanger, and no resolution. Do not buy this particular DVD [package represented runtime of 598 min]. Packaging was also cheap; arrived broken with one of the discs rattling around loose in the case."
5,Hooked on Da Vinci,"I can see that I am not the only one who was mesmerized by this program. I've been watching for the past month and have my DVR set for this great show. My wife is now hooked on it too. We loved to discuss it and the characters' moods and such. So much is said by a ""look"". We also laugh about how on Law & Order and other American crime dramas they'd be yelling at the suspect and throwing things around. The Amer. cop show moods are somber to instant EXTREME anger. On Da Vinci, these guys listen with quiet respect even to people who are obviously mentally unbalanced. It's the kind of show I'd want everyone to be like and see. I love the Da Vinci/Zack sessions!!Now, make the rest of the seasons for us to buy please."
5,Definitely NOT censored,Please be assured that the Acorn Media DVD of Da Vinci's Inquest has most definitely NOT been censored. It is 611 minutes long and is the UNCUT version.Can anyone give a specific example of a scene from the program that has something censored in it?
1,received wrong book,I received the new testatment instead of the book ordered and when I realized it - it was too late to return.
3,primrose hill,"Primrose Hill gives the reader an insight into the lives of teenagers living in a bad estate in London. The dialogue and characters are very realistic, though I found Eleanor an extremely disturbing character. The language is quite crude, but necessary for the tone. Though it may seem depressing (the subject matter certainly is), it is delivered in a lighthearted and often hilarious way. Si's struggle to determine right from wrong from the grey areas perfectly represents the confusion that is the essence of adolescence."
2,This Item came up in a search for aggressive chewers...,I have a 3 year old Golden Retriever/ Lab mix. This item came up in a search for aggressive chewers b/c he more than likely will destroy whatever toy you give him. His Kong even has a few tears in it. He chewed this toy apart in about an hour.
3,Fun and colorful,"Neat toy, but my dogs won't really play with it. They are super picky and I guess this didn't do it for them. It is tough though. Great for dogs who aren't picky about thier toys."
2,It's Tiny!,"When I read the description of this product, I assumed it was 7"" as pictured. It's 7"" stretched! It's 1/2 that size as pictured. I'd never give this tiny thing to my 15 pound Min Pin mix puppy. He'd rip it apart in seconds. I returned it to Amazon.com."
3,mixed,"My dog enjoyed tossing this toy around and pulling on it. It probably would have lasted a long time. Unfortunately, my friend's dog, a lab that eats rather than plays with toys, totally destroyed it in about five minutes.So if your dog is a real chewer, this thing won't hold up."
3,Not for My Dog,"My dog is more of a plush toy chewer, but I thought I would try this after reading great reviews. It has a strong rubber smell. It's fun for a little tug of war, but he's not that interested in playing. He won't voluntarily pick up for chewing/playing."
2,Nice design but very weak toy,"I give this 2 stars instead of one because this would be a great toy if it wasn't built so weakly. The toy was in pieces within 5 minutes. The rubber used is very soft and weak, my dog started pulling off chunks of it immediately. If there was one made from a better rubber I would buy it though as the design is interesting and it seems like it would be a fun toy."
2,Not the same size as before,This is NOT a 'Large Dog' toy. I have owned this toy before and this is a small for a small or medium sized dog. A choking hazard for a large dog. Charged a 'large dog' price for this item. Need to relabel toy as small/medium. This item comes up when you search for 'Large dog toy'. If you have a small or medium sized dog it is rugged and will last a long time. Disappointed in the labeling of this item - especially since I have purchased it before. Sadly had to return.
3,Smaller than expected...,"I ordered this toy for my new lab puppy, when it said small i though puppy=small, boy was i worng. When this toy is rolled into a ball he can put the entire thing in his mouth and that freaks me out! its great for teething and safer than ropes for tug-o-war, but i do not recommend the samll size for larger breeds."
3,Dog Toy,"This toy was suppose to be for dogs who were chewers, who were ""action"" dogs. While my dog loved this toy and it looked very cool, she ripped a big chunk out of it within ten minutes, simply from sitting and chewing on it."
2,Not good for chewers,I have a 2 year old dog that loves to chew on toys and often destroys them within seconds. I thought this toy might last a while longer since it had some pretty good reviews from people that have dogs that chew. I gave my dog the toy and a couple minutes later he was swallowing the chunks he had chewed off. It is fun to throw and play tug of war with but it's not a good toy to let my dog play with alone. I have yet to find an indestructible dog toy with the exception of the nylabones.
1,Almost killed by dog,"The makers of this toy want you to believe it is made for big dogs and rough play. There are a few reviews that seem to back up this contention, so I ordered it for my 70 pound shepard mix. It arrived on a Wednesday afternoon. Thursday morning he was playing with the toy before I left for work when a piece came off and choked him. Thank goodness I am trained to deal with emergencies and was able to clear his obstructed airway. No dog toy should fall apart and become a choking hazard after less than 18 hours of ownership and less than two hours of playtime.If you have a dog stronger than a teacup poodle, I strongly suggest buying a higher quality toy. The cheap price tag is not worth the life of your pet."
5,Fun Toy,"The 1 year old lab pup that can destroy anything in a few days if not hours still hasn't been able to destroy this one. It's flexible enough that she can't get a death grip or stretch on it. It rolls and bounces around in interesting ways, unfortunately that often means under the couch. Will definitely purchase another of these if she ever figures out how to break this one."
1,Stinky toy...literally,We have two 11 week old puppies and neither one of them has ever played with this toy at all. It looks fun and I tried to get them to play with it many times. Then I realized the smell of it up close and it is super stinky rubber! Even puppies who sniff hind ends wouldn't play with it and I wonder if the reason is the stink?? Going in the garbage...
1,NOT FOR CHEWERS!!!,"If you have a dog that does any amount of chewing, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID! I have a small 40lb hound mix, this toy lasted less than 5 hours. He chewed it and eat some of it before I realized what was happening. The tag on the toy says for chewing and tug a war. Tug a war maybe, but definitley not for dogs that chew. Remember, my dog is only 40LBs, I can't imagine how fast a rottie or a pit would go through this toy."
3,Lasted 2-3 hours before chewed apart,"This toy outlasted 90% of dog toys but still did not survive one full evening of chewing from my boxer and had to be thrown away on the first day.So far the only toy from JW that I have tried that survives heavy chewing from my dog is the MegaLast Bone toy, which I think is a very good value compared to Kong products, which are the only other rubber toys that survive. The MegaLast Bone has lasted months without a rip, tear, or puncture."
1,Not for a chewer!,I bought this for my 2 dogs to play tug of war with but before they got to that the puppy took a bite out of it and I had to throw it away. Had it on the floor for all of 5 minutes. A complete waste of money.
2,not for heavy chewers,I bought this for my dogs. They are very heavy chewers and nothing lasts very long. This toy lasted about a week and then they started to get it apart.
2,Small Disappointment,"I was disappointed in the ""large"" size. It's a fairly small toy, definitely too small to play tug of war with a medium-sized dog. Usually when I see the word ""large"", I assume it's a good size for a large dog. I think this would be a ""large"" toy for a beagle or a yorkie, but it's a very small toy for our lab mix. I would not recommend people with dogs over 40 lbs consider this toy."
3,"Great - super strong, not a fave toy of the dogs for some reason, though.","This toy is fantastic if you have tough chewers - it springs right back into shape. For some reason, they prefer the West Paw BUMI I purchased at the same time, though they seem to be the same material. This is neat, though - it looks like a ginormous DNA strand."
3,"Bought this for my cats, they don't really like it","I bought this for my cats because they chew on cardboard and plastic items all the time but they don't really like it... It has a bit of a plasticky smell, and is smaller than I imagined. Not terrible, but not a hit in my house."
3,Didn't last long,"My 16 month old Vizsla loved this toy, however he loved it so much that it only lasted 15 minutes before the first piece came off. All told it lasted 45 minutes. Good toy if your dog isn't an OCD chewer. Saddly for me this was a waste of money."
2,Meh,Neither of my dogs was remotely interested in this toy after the initial courtesy sniff. I'm not sure if it's the rubber smell or if they just don't find it appealing.
4,"Good, Durable Toy for the Price :)","My border collie puppy LOVES this toy! It's perfect for fetch or tug-o-war, though eventually (after lots of use) it wore out and broke in one spot. But for the price, this is a good and pretty durable toy. I would recommend it!"
1,Dog not interested in this at all,"The title pretty much sums it up. This toy has a distinctive smell (almost like baby powder), so I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it. I've tried reintroducing it a few times with no luck.Update: I thread jerky sticks into the toy, which makes my dog work for the treat. However, once the treat is gone she loses interest in the toy immediately."
1,Not Pit Worthy,Our Pit/Lab mix had this toy for exactly one hour and it was chewed to pieces. It is not as advertised and I certainly would not recommend it.
4,Not Made of One Piece,"I received these measuring cups, and they are not stamped out of one piece. The handles are bolted on, just as in any set of measuring cups."
1,The worst tapes in the world,"First , my blessings to the person who gave 1 star.Unfortunately it was too late for me. The worst spent money of my life. Ofcourse 1 star is to mutch for this garbage. An old person saying stupid things.This is all about. I am sure that people who gave more than 1 star, are friends of the author. This kind of crap sould be forbiden for selling at amazon's. Save your money and run away."
1,Disappointed,"Incredibly difficult to listen to. The yelling and ""over-the-top,"" cartoon-character behavior of the instructor was so distracting, I couldn't finish the series. And, I didn't glean anything from what I was able to endure, as I was so distracted and put off by his manner."
2,He should practice what he preaches!,"There's good information here, but I found it very uncomfortable to listen to. Tom Miller spends too much time yelling (yes, yelling) at audience members who give wrong answers to his silly ""class-participation"" questions. For example, he'll be talking about something really interesting, ask the group a question, and suddenly start screaming: ""Who said UP?! Who said it?! I'll rip their face off! The answer is DOWN!"". He comes across as a very angry man who likes to belittle the people he's trying to help."
2,Bring your Thesaurus,"This book is a tough read. Ms. Hanson has certainly done her research, but her prose is barely understandable because she uses many words that are unfamiliar to the common reader and her sentences are a mile long. This book is only for hard-core fans of D.W. Griffith's Intolerance and Rudolph Valentino. Be warned, you will need help staying awake while you read it..."
4,Clarity counts,"This book is clear and straightforward and since following the exercise program for two weeks, I see a difference. Had tried chiro, accupuncture, physical therapy and lots of exercises but these are structured and show levels to advance through--very helpful for my lower back."
3,Approach with an open-mind,"As a Shi'i, I do not have any difficulties in accepting the Shi'i doctrines because I have always been taught the reasoning behind them. Therefore, it can be misleading to those who are not very familiar with Shi'i beliefs, to read books that do not give its reasoning, (clearly indicated by the misunderstanding by many). It is also worth noting that not everything published about the Shi'a are true, and so reliable sources must be followed. I recommend to those interested the book, Then I Was Guided, by Sheikh Teejani al-Samawi (available online, and summarised in al-islam.org). This book traces the life of the author and his first encounter with a Shi'i, his detailed study of Shi'ism and its acceptance (very enjoyable to read). You can also ask the Shi'a about their beliefs, especially when the reasoning is needed."
2,Little misleading,"Coming from a guy who's been researching the Shi'i context of Islam, this book is a little misleading, no offense to Heinz Halm. The misleading part of this book stems off from the stereotypical Orientalist view of Shiism. I read this book about four years back and I remember when I started reading into different schools of Islamic thought, what I realized was that its sources were mainly ripped off from Pro Sunnite scholarship, claiming Shiism to be a politically inflamed creed, based upon revolution and rebellion( which is true to some extent), what it fails to introduce is real resources from Shiite scholarly works from Al kulayni to Majilisi, Tusi etc.. and the philosophical nature of the theological stance on Imamate. It neglects to give Shiism a say from a Shiites scholars point of view. For anybody interested in learning about Shi'ism at its roots, this is not a great book to look at."
4,Two great Action Horror movies together,You can't go wrong with this combo pack. Van Helsing is an interesting twist to the story of the famous Vampire Hunter with lots of action and a gathering of the famous Monsters of the past. The Mummy with Brandan Fraiser is not you typical monster classic but lots of action and lots of funny scenes and lines throughout the movie. You will want to watch these movies again and again.
5,The best album. Ever.,The best album. Ever. Buy it right now and hear the best guitarist of all time at his best.
5,This tool works great.,This is a great little tool that is easy to carry and use. I keep mine in the range bag just incase anyone at the range needs adjust thier AK/SKS front sight post when I am there.
2,Hmmmmm,"This product was sold under the heading sks forward sight adjuster/removal tool. I have yet to come accross an sks that this tool works for. it wont fit through the hole above the sight pin. It may function really well, but i have no idea."
4,fits tight,it works as intended but fit very tight in my chinese rifles hood but after shaving it a little worked a ok
3,Gets the job done,"It works. How long it will work is questionable. Looks and feels cheap, but hey it is. I have a shrouded sight on my AK and was worried it wouldn't work, but it did."
3,"Good for what it is, but it's incomplete.","This is a nice, efficient design with a slick plastic covering. If you're adjusting the elevation on your SKS, it'll do just fine as long as the front sight isn't too tight or rusted. Two things of which you must be made aware, though: It isn't made for Yugo SKSs (though cutting back the plastic sleeve and filing away the inner surface might do the trick) and it won't adjust the wingage. There are a lot of good combination tools (look like C-clamps with a notch at the end of the bolt) out there. Usually it's ""jack of all trades, master of none"", but the combo tool really does a great job with each if you're looking for a good sighting in."
2,Not good enough,"Worked find for a while, but burned out turning just 2-3 gallons of thinset. Had to finish with my B&D 18v cordless. Stepping up the DW511 with is 6.7 amp versus 5.0. 1 year warranty is lame."
1,FDV16VB Hammer Drill,"I purchased this drill at a local discount lumber yardand took it home for a personal try,on installing a 1/2 inch drill on second hole thur a 2x4 the drill made a noise and smoke came out the drill, i do not recommend this drill to no one thanks."
3,it's ok so far,It smoked today as i tried to use it as hole saw. hope it is ok. Drilled holes in concrete yesterday.
2,Good for small tapcons only,"This thing is fine for small tapcon screws, but don't try to make big holes in anything hard with it.I had an experience similar to one of the other reviews. I was drilling 5/8ths inch holes in concrete with it. I drilled 2 holes and then the bit started to slip. Tightened up the chuck and it worked a while and then slipped again. I was able to barely finish the job by really jamming the chuck tight every 10 seconds of drilling or so.Now the chuck won't even close, I think it's completely shot. Anyway this drill is great if all you need to do is sink tapcons with a little bit. If you ever want to make big holes, get something else. This thing is liable to give up after only one hole."
4,Use it correctly and it works fine,"If you read the other reviews about this drill you'll see complaints about burning out, etc. This is not a heavy duty contractor type tool. It is great for heavy duty homeowner use where the duty cycle is fairly short. It is specifically NOT for mixing drywall mud or thinset. This is hard on any drill not designed for this task. It is NOT for drilling holes in concrete where you have to do this continually over a sustained period of time for over a half hour. One guy said he burned out a 5/16"" drill using this in concrete. Well, this has a variable speed to drill at an appropriate speed in concrete and if you use a good quality bit it works just fine. And be aware that the ""5/8"" inch means the drilling capacity in concrete NOT the chuck size which is 1/2"". Treat this tool well and use it for it's intended use and it will perform well."
4,Good light duty drill for the jobs around the house,"Since I have a lot of little jobs around the house this easy to handle light and durable piece of machinery is just the thing I need. The first instinct is to buy a powerful tool but this being a second drill I decided some thing light and easy to use is just what I really need. The drill is quite powerful for its size/weight and its variable speed can be used for driving. The drill would warrant a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the variable speed trigger, which is not as smooth when trying to variate the speed, but with regular use I've learned to feather the trigger for driving screws."
4,Excellent for around the house,"I've had this drill for two weeks and it does the job fine for me (around the house). It drills through wood and plastic with no problem what-so-ever (maybe the guy who had the drill die while drilling through a 2x4 had a defective product). It eats concrete block with no problem (A friend and I have drilled maybe 20 holes in block) and I even used it on poured concrete. It took maybe 10-15 seconds to drill an 1 1/2 inch deep hole, but I wasn't expecting anything better.One of the best tips I've heard re: power tools is to let the tool work for you. I didn't ""get into it"" and apply all 210 lbs of me into the drill. ON the concrete, relax, put it on a low setting, and apply modest pressure. The tool, the bit and you will benefit.Overall, for around the house and for the money, this drill is perfect."
2,bad drill,"Don't like the speed control or chuck on this drill. Bits keep coming loose in hammer mode no matter how hard I twist the key. Key does not fit cogs of chuck well either. Speed control also unsatisfactory. either full speed or too slow,nothing in between."
2,Heavy duty hammer drill? I think not!,"I bought this drill to replace a 3/8"" Skil that was 20 years old. I used it for thinset and grout mix it smelled like it was burning but, worked fine no problems. I then used it to drill 1"" holes in poured concrete. It lasted for only 8 holes the bits kept coming out of the drill no matter how hard I tightened the chuck. Then on the 8th hole it started smoking and died (brushes are shot). This is labeled a heavy duty hammer drill. I think not. I don't suggest this for anyone who uses a drill alot."
4,Decoupage patterns,"These are pretty and colorful patterns. They are ""dated"" in the sense that they are patterns that were popular probably a century ago. Some of this I find odd (like children's heads popping out of flowers and fruits) but there aren't too many of those and maybe some people like children ""emerging"" from fruits and flowers! All around a good selection, I would think most people would find much to their liking in these designs."
2,Rambling Consumerist Babble,"I had high hopes for this book. The notion of a uniting, core drive is appealing. But after reading halfway, it is revealing it's true colors as a rambling hodge-podge of mutually contradictory theories without coherence or concrete action plan.The main ""meat"" section is strictly designed for business selling. No plan is provided for home telesales. Later chapters feature high school psychology concepts along with cut/paste Internet newsclippings etc."
3,Keeping It in the Family,"Wicked! Dominique Sanda is quite the seductress. This film deserves a better film treatment, an Italian director's cut, instead of this poorly transferred, expurgated, U.S dub release."
5,Best book on the Mormon Battalion,"Sherman Fleek has written the most authoritative tome on the Mormon Battalion. Most writers approaching this subject do not have any significant military experience. Not Sherman. As a retired Lt. Col. who is presently Command Historian at West Point and who has written many articles on this era of our history, Sherman is uniquely qualified to write on this subject. Sherman grasps the true military and historical significance of this most unique group of religiously-oriented American soldiers. As he points out in his book, there has not been such a singular religious group of American soldiers before or since. Any serious student of Mormon history must read this book. Any serious student of American history who wants to study the broad diversity of our military history should also study this book. Written from an objective perspective, Sherman Fleek does a superb job of describing every important aspect of this unusual part of our history."
3,Not the Same Title as the McDonald Observatory Copy,"I made the same mistake as the disappointed reviewer--searched under ""The Power of Ten"" instead of under ""Powers of Ten."" They are two different videos. If you're looking for ""Powers of Ten,"" which shows increasingly distant views from the original subject matter (in powers of ten), change your search term--Amazon does have it (at the same price as the McDonald Observatory)."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered the tape after returning from the McDonaldObservatory and wishing I had purchased""The Power of Ten"" there. I was disappointedto find this a totally different video with thesame name. It was home video quality--$$$is too much for this type of film. The tapeshows a man giving a lecture--it may have been agreat lecture, but I wasn't in the mood to goto class, so I didn't even watch the whole thing."
3,New space film for me,A little ho hum. Very raw information but learned new things. Disappointed in the narration but had lots of new information
5,"10 years ahead of its time, at least","This is the *most* interesting business book I ever read, and I did read several hundred books on marketing and management. In this, his last book, Richard Normann pioneers so many new ideas which academics slowly start to appreciate.Because many of his ideas are so radical, it is not an easy book and requires a lot of reflection to understand how this new landscape looks like. My colleagues and I tried to capture some of the essence in the following article: S. Michel, S. L. Vargo and R. F. Lusch, ""Reconfiguration of the Conceptual Landscape: A Tribute to the Service Logic of Richard Normann,"" Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, volume 36, 1 2008, pp. 152-155."
1,Sportline Walking Advantage Back Support Slimmer Belt,"I recently bought this belt hoping it would provide my back with added support, but it doesn't give any support to the back. It might be good as an abdominal binder, but if your looking for back support this product won't give it. It is a good length and the velcro holds well, but the little extented flap area on the back doesn't get stretched at all so there is absolutely no support at that area or anywhere else on the back."
2,Somewhat dissapointed,"I just love hearing Il Divo sing, but when I received this Yule log DVD it skipped from the very beginning and throughout the entire DVD. I played it on my laptop and it played perfectly. My DVD player is fairly new and I have not had any problems playing other DVD's."
4,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED,"The music is great but we were disappointed that it wasn't actually a video of IL Divobut scenes of holiday fare. We always look forward to watching them sing in concert, whether in person or on DVD. Happy holidays to all."
1,disappointed..,Bought this for my wife thinking it was a concert video of Christmas songs..it turned out to be a Christmas recording with pictures of burning fireplaces etc.. I should have read the liner notes before I ordered..Gave it away to a person we are trying to make Ildivo fans..Bought the new video also and we are delighted with it..maybe my mistake..
2,The Il Divo Christmas Collection,"The music in this album was very good, but I was disappointed that it was not a ""Live"" concert. The use of only three winter pictures to accompany the music was a surprise to me. If I had known that this was not a live concert recording,I would not have purchased the DVD. I could have gotten the same music on a CD for less cost."
2,Il Divo--not what expected,"I ordered this DVD for my wife. She has the ""non DVD"" version and wanted to see them sing. This was in Our Opionon a rip off and I should have read the reviews before ordering. Just three scenes, no Il Divo's. Now we can play at the same time on both stereos."
2,The Yule Log DVD,I didn't realize that It was the same as the CD. I thought I was going to see IL Divo perform the songs. It was not clear in your preview
3,Not what i expected,"This is his worst album that he has put out, but there are a few good songs on here. I can only listen to a few songs on the cd before i want to throw it out the window. Its worth the money but not his best. Get his other albums if you want great rap. laterz"
1,This is a poor quality album Do Not Buy!,I don't know why in the hell everybody thinks this album is so great. As you know X raided is locked up in prison for murder so there is no way he can get to a studio to make a record right? So he raps his songs over the prison telephone and records them and yep you guessed it folks this whole album was recorded over the telephone and you get poor telephone sounding quality music for the whole album. Don't waste your money on this one folks! But don't get me wrong I think X-raided is the the only true real life original gangster rapper out there and he does deserve much respect and he does have a excellent album called Psyco Active (wich is NOT recorded on the phone either). So if you love sick perverse violent rap artits as much as I do you should get Psyco Active by X Raided but not Xorcist.
1,bad deal - only 5 episodes,"This is a bad deal--there are only 5 episodes. The better deal is to purchase the season 1 & 2 combo pack, since there are 5 and 13 episodes, respectively. Monetarily, it is better to purchase the combo pack."
1,Liked it at first,"Kept chips very fresh - then would not hold a seal. When I emptied the container, I found it had cracked along the bottom."
2,Too skinny for practical use,"The item does what it says it does, but the dimensions are pretty much for spaghetti or tall licorice. Most items that we would use the item for fit in the container...and waste a good deal of space at the top. One of the wider-shorter containers is much more useful for 95% of what you would put in it.Definitely a one-time purchase for a container with these dimensions."
4,Nice watch,"I have had the watch for a couple of months now and I like it quite a bit. Nice, functional design. Sits well on my wrist. It's also fairly light which makes it ideal for an active lifestyle. What really attracted me to this watch was it's simple, slick look. Not at all audacious like many timepieces on the market. If that is the look you are going after, then you probably wouldn't like this watch."
4,Wenger GMT: Good pilot watch.,"I'm a private pilot, and have used the Wenger GMT Aerograph for two years with no problems.The 24-hour numerals are small, and best read in a still environment; the minute-hand has 30 seconds of mechanical play in it; the second hand ticks are sloppy; and as mentioned by others, the Zulu hand has to be tweaked to sync with local time. So it's no Rolex in terms of precision.Also, the back must be opened with a larger than normal tool that not every cheap shop has.However, the local-time face is extremely readable at a quick glance, the watch is reliable and keeps very good time, and, as mentioned by others, it is light and looks cool.It's a good buy for the money."
5,gawain comes alive,"Over the years I've read versions of this poem by numerous people: Brian Stone (the best before this), Tolkien, Raffael, Silverstein, and the archaic and almost unreadable version by Marie Boroff, and more. This is by far and away the best I've come across so far. For one thing, it's astonishingly accurate. Second, it's in a highhly crafted and subtly alliterated modern English. It SOUNDS like someone telling a story not putting on a literary manner and trying to sound important. I despaired of ever being able to introduce my students in reading groups to a convincing translation of this marvelous tale, and here it is. I listened to this version on Public Radio years ago and was captivated. Now I have the book and will delight in sharing the story with my students with a confidence I never had in any of the other translations. Fine introduction too - by the author and by Helen Cooper. Very highly recommended."
4,Good overall.,"Product was good, arived on time for the holidays, but shipping was kinda chinsy. As a result the orange cone popped off the front end, though it saved my brother having to use pliars to do the same. Gun itself is good, but they should move the shell release button to the other side so its more convienant."
4,"Better than expected, well worth the value!","I bought this expecting a ""you get what you pay for"". But for the price you get much more with this trailer than similarly priced trailers. I researched lots of trailers from inStep, Schwinn, Giant, Burley, etc. and this one had the features I wanted for the best price.Features I looked for:seating 1 or 2 childrenpadded shoulder straps20"" wheelslight (20 lbs)folds up compactlyFeatures I got in addition:Stroller additions (bar and front wheel)I would have given this trailer 5 stars, but the cover has these velcro strips that don't match up exactly to the velcro on the trailer. The 3 on the front match up, but the 2 on the sides don't quite work. There are 2 more velcro loops on each side near the top that hold everything in place plus two clips that hold the cover in the back. I had it out last night and there was no problems with the cover on a 17 mile ride.Happy Riding!"
4,good bargain...,Our grandchildren have already enjoyed their first ride in the Dreamer Design bike trailer..It arrived promptly amd in excellent condition and was only missing one little non-integral piece..
2,Don't Spend the Xtra Money for Digital Counter,"While the ab slider works fine, the digital counter does not work at all (after having spent extra money for it) and there were no instructions. So, just buy the regular ab slider if you are considering buying this item."
2,Don't rush to buy this product,"The Product is OK not very great and after doing excercise for 5 min. everyday, it doesn't help me build any abs. Also, the LCD Digital counter doesn't work and forget about Satellite TV. Nobody gives you such things. I am very frustrated with Amazon for this purchase."
1,Don't do it!,"One of the handles would not go in, the digital unit did not work and had no instructions on how to work it and when I would use the unit the little keeper ring on the side would cut into the side of the housing and cause some drag or friction. They told me to send it back for a replacement and I'm STILL WAITING and WAITING!!! So I Would rate this unit a -0- How do I get my monies back???"
3,knock-off,"This is my 3rd Ab-Slider; although this one appears to be a cheaper made ""knock-off"" from the original. It has a smaller internal coil - which is the part that snaps and breaks after several months of use from any of these. I expect this one to break much sooner. I was looking for a deal - but should have known something was up when the shipping was almost as much as the Ab-Slider- I'm sure the seller padded the shipping cost to to make up for the lower cost of the slider."
5,Sensitive skin & acne since a teenager,"Firstly, I would like to mention that Im a Nurse, so clinically Dr. Perricone's research makes total sense. Ive had acne forever, on my face, on my back and neck too! I tried birth control, tons of face washes, proactiv, dermatologists gave me topical antibiotic as well as pills. Nothing worked! EXCEPT this diet plan. When I was in my 20's I tried the diet for 3 weeks and saw very visible results. Pimples were popping up less and my face looked like it was healing. Even my uncle (who was visiting) asked me why my face looked like it was glowing-and asked if I had just got a facial done. If he noticed it, my mom, plus me I think its enough validation. Im 30 now, and didnt keep up the diet, went back into my bad dietary habits (no fruits, no veggies) and acne is back and eczema. Eczema is an inflammatory response - so I think I will go back on the diet and see how it goes."
4,It worked,"This book has lots of good information in it, I tried it for a bit and it actually seemed to work. It's kind of hard to stick to the foods though."
3,This program plus microdermx worked,"I used to have acne scars, zits and skin that was showing signs of aging. I used the perricone program for a while and did like have some positive results. But then after hearing about Microdermx on beauty forums, I tried it and the Microdermx has completely changed my bad skin into skin that I looks beautiful to me. I have about 85% less acne scars, no acne, and my skin is firmer with a glow. The price is better too than say Dr. Brandts."
1,Interesting Idea - will cause OCD,"For someone already obsessed with their complexion, finding ways to control their life through a complete change of diet is probably not the healthiest method.For me, I found that my skin finally cleared up on its own once I started accepting myself for who I am and for the skin that I am in during this instance.I did notice that my skin appeared a bit better while eating these foods, but I would really urge people to enjoy life and not become obsessed with their skin to the point where they feel the need to control everything they eat."
3,waste of my time,The flash is not working the best for me. Is it me? Maybe. But took it to camera shop and they told me never by an off brand for a name brand camera. You get what you pay for.
4,A great veiw of christmas,"I purchased this after buying number of books in a the ""A Day in a life of"" series, great photography and adjoining stories."
5,Christmas In America,This book has become a family tradition at our house. I just bought two more copies so that my married children can each have one of their own.
5,A good game,"I played this game years ago as a rental, then purchased it recently so I could play it again. My only real complaint would be that the repeated mashing of buttons necessary to play it can feel like it's giving you carpel tunnel syndrome if you play too much. Another thing (I guess I lied when I said I only had one complaint), I wish you didn't need to use a memory pack for this game. I unlocked and received gold medals in every event and set all sorts of records, only for my memory pack to go screwy, and now I've lost all of that."
4,Get the chance to be an Olympian,"I'll start off by saying this is a great game. Competing as an Olympian doing many many events from the 100 M dash, to javelin, to swimming, to weightlifting. Just to name a few. There are four events you need to unlock in order to play them. It is pretty hard to unlock all four new events, but can be worth it.P.S. (Tiny spoiler alert) I don't know why the guy on the cover is holding a baton. Because there is no baton race in this game."
5,"As Originally Penned, Not Revised","""We the People"", compiled and edited by James F. Gauss, Ph.D., is a convenient resource for anyone studying the founding of the United States of America. Here one can find in one reference book those documents which were key to establishing our country's principles and laws---find them as they were originally penned, not revised to suit present philosophy or political correctness."
1,Fire and Brimstone,"Dr. Gauss's works find an audience in a world that relies on whether or not Abraham had broken his covenant with God, also I'm pretty sure he wrote a guide of lists to survive Y2K... any ethos for this fundamentalist should be shattered by that work alone. This book relies on tradition and is nostalgic for an era he obviously doesn't understand."
5,WHOO-HOOO! STAR TREK!,Great Star Trek game... wait... what am I saying? Awesome Star Trek Game! Its even supposed to have a level where you fight on the hull of the Enterprise E! This is gonna be one of the best games ever. The demo is awesome!
3,"Good, but 'elite'?","This game's graphics and story line are much improved on the first entry, ST: Elite Force. It also adds some puzzle-solving tasks, which is a nice way to break up the action. If you liked the first game you are likely to enjoy this sequel, but don't expect anything new to the FPS genre.Some issues:The single-player game doesn't take long to complete - a day or so, if you're putting in solid hours. This may not be much of a concern if you plan to play multi-player.Second, and I know this is subjective, the designers (at Ritual) have given us very few holomatch maps from which to choose, and they all look like they came from Doom III. What happened to the space station maps of EF ver. 1?"
3,Star Trek Elite Force 2,"If I had a choice, I would Elite Force before I play this game. I wanted forever but the game is not bad. The game requires you to do a lot of baby-sitting and you are compressed to time. The tricoder has to be used a lot like to find energy terminals and health terminals. The game offers a variety of people or things to shoot at. The problem or the good news is that you have to spend a lot of time by yourself, the game is quite clever because the different team members doing some of the thinking but you can't shoot them or hurt them like you did in the other elite force game. When you did in that game, they would turn around and shoot you and even if you killed them, the game didn't allow to go on but that is not a problem in this game. Last, the game is not a very good game to be basing on the series. Picard and Barclay are the only people from TNG and Tuvok is brought back as well."
4,"Very good game, only one bug....","This is a good game: great graphics, interesting story, a very satisfying assortment of weapons and you get an up-close view of the Soveriegn Class Federation starship (nice looking main shuttle bay, and big too!).BUT: Before installing the game, make sure that you have DirectX 9 compatible video and audio hardware and drivers installed on your computer or else the game will completely lock up your PC on the second part of the game. I had to download new drivers for ATI video card and Soundblaster sound card to fix this problem.Other than that, this game is better than the first Elite Force in many ways and its worth the $$."
4,Star Trek Elite Force II,"An fps based on the Tv show with the voice of real cast including Captain Picard. Built on the Quake3 engine the graphics are not much different and quite dated today but the system requierements are low. You play the leader of the Hazard Team, Lt. Munro and take over the baddies who have a weapon of mass destruction. Some of the missions are linear while some missions are very hard. This time you can choose what to say and even choose which women you want your charecter to fall in love with. EF2 is better than the orginal. If you liked the orginal you will love this one."
5,Elite Force Strikes Back,"I recently ordered Star Trek Elite Force 2 and from what I have learned the game will include brand new weapons, never before seen, more holomatches on holodeck, and of coarse- what we have been waiting for-Roaming mode, where you can walk the Enterprise vessel controling all that happens, and interacting with Members on the ship. I own Star Trek: Voyager Collectors edition and I know the graphics are very nice...but with Elite Force 2 the graphics look almost like a humanlike movie. Even if you dont watch Enterprise on UPN every Wednesday night at 9pm you will enjoy this game."
2,It was not as expected,"I thought that the story line in the first edition was much better and considerably more challenging. The graphics and game play have kept up with technology, however."
5,Elite Forces2,"Dunno why they pulled it from the USA shelves so quickly, i was planning on buying the Gold or GOTY version later on so i wouldn't have to buy the expansion packs and suddenly it was pulled from the stores never to be seen again.I was very satisfied with this product. as it said Pegi on it instead of ESRB i am led to believe that this was a non USA version but that still made no difference in playing it. it ran just fine on my computer and i was able to get lots of screenshots for the StarTrek CCG Dreams cards i was messing around with creating.The price was a little steep but considering how rare it was this seller had the lowest price i had seen for it."
5,"Single player great, multiplayer technically challenging","SINGLE PLAYER: GREAT! Very Long and involved story, fun sub plots occuring in the background.MULTIPLAYER: Very Fast. Weapons hit hard, this is not a game where you take a little damage and run around looking to get healed.TECHNICAL SUPPORT: Their support has responded, during the business week, within 1 day to any inquiry. When they have offered support, it has been accurate. No Support of console features, such as cheat modes or hosting your own server.ONLINE PLAY TECHNICAL ASPECTS: You can not host and play on the internet on the same machine. Two machines are required. Only one player per license can play on line at any given time. LAN play does not have these restrictions."
3,Set Phasers to Stun,"All in all this was a decent game. The atmosphere was good, and the graphics were much improved from the original Elite Force. The weapons and sounds were authentic to the series as well. So what, you may ask, is the reason I only gave it a 3? This is because it has poor replay value. I beat it in about 3 days and I don't really feel like going through again. Good game though, I liked it. If you're a Star Trek fan its a good game to check out."
2,how the mighty have fallen...short.,"the first Elite Force was ground breaking and a good FPS for its time (2000 a.d.) but this game just stinks. it fell short of every expactation i had. first off the game is too short. only 10-11 missions, i finished in 2 days. second, this game IS NOT Star Trek, its just another monster fighting FPS...soooooo dissapointing. i wanna fight Borg, Romulans, cardassians and other Alpha quadrent foes...not monsters...if i wanted monsters id pick up Doom. the one thing that was okay in the game were the weapon choices and the fact it takes place in the alpha quadrent on the Enterprise. dont waste your money like i did, im 50$ out."
1,Sequels are better? Wrong!,"I got Elite Force II 'bout a couple of months after it came out. I had previously tried the demo on Windows ME but the mouse cursor was so slow. Now I have the real game and these are the pros and cons of the game.Pros:-Good GraphicsCons:-Where's Voyager?-Very Slow-Hard playI thought this game would be based on ST: Voyager, but I was wrong! The only Voyager characters that they have is Tuvok and Barclay, which does not really count. Just throw this game away and get Star Trek Voyager Elite Force on PC or it's expansion pack."
1,"Nice price, horrible quality, 100% failure rate","We run a small business and we bought 6 of these small DVD home theatre systems as gifts for employees and customers. They are nice, compact, cheap and perfect for a bedroom unit. However, you absolutely get what you pay for. All 6 of these units have failed within 3 months of opening the box. The only thing that is left working are the speakers. The manufacturer really cut every corner possible in order to build this product, and the failure rate proves this fact. The manufacturer offers a 90-day warranty, and we were able to find the receipt and get 2 of them replaced. We just had to pay for the cost of the outbound shipping on the defective product, and an additional $18.00 to cover the cost for the return shipping. If you choose to buy this item, save your receipts because you'll likely need it when the product dies on you."
2,I was so hopeful,"I bought this movie because I'm a fan of Florencia Lozano (Celeste), she said in an interview that she'd always wanted to carry a movie and finally had. My first disappointment came when my DVD player got to the main menu and the only subtitles available were Spanish. I stopped watching roughly 1/4 of the way through, because at that point, she hadn't been featured much, and the scene where I stopped, she was speaking Spanish. I can more or less understand Spanish when spoken a bit slower than native, but at that point, she was in a church and I gave up."
2,Not worth the watch,"Those are one and a half hours of my life that I can't get back. Although John Leguizamo did an excellent job in his dual role as twin brothers Dante and Perfecto Mendoza from the Bronx bent on revenge against slumlords and crooked cops because of an accident in their past, I found the movie confusing, disjointed and kind of 'B-movie-ish'. Harvey Keitel is okay but nothing memorable imho as cop partner Joe Bruno. Wanda De Jesus, who I have never seen before, was very good in her role as police Lieutenant Diaz.The film begins with a teenager witnessing her detective father's murder outside a restaurant by a 'messenger of the Lord'. Fast forward thirteen years ahead and this teenager, Celeste (played by Florencia Lozano), is now a NYPD detective investigating the execution of slumlords, an execution carried out in the same style as that of her father. In the process, she becomes involved with one of his killers.Not worth the watch."
2,Can't handle espresso grinds,"My grinder is 6 months old and already: (1) so much fine dust built up on the motor that it slowed almost to a crawl, (2) the doser fails to catch and deliver a dose, (3) too much coffee flies out onto the countertop, (4) the finely ground coffee builds up and eventually clogs the output from the grinder area to the doser area, and (5) the owner's manual is useless for information to take apart the grinder and clean it.It works much better with the coarser gind for drip coffee, but stay away from it if you want to use it on weekends for espresso."
2,Great grinder -- for a few months...,"I loved this grinder when I first bought it. That it has an espresso doser was a big plus. And for a few months this was a great little machine. Soon, though, grounds started jamming up the burr. Then, when grinding fine coffee, it would block the exit into the ground coffee receptacle. It seemed like I was taking the thing apart every day. This caused the bean holder to crack, and now it's unusable. I guess I could get some of the parts repaired, but for ... bucks, I would expect a little more than 3 months of trouble free operation. Fortunately I have an old blade grinder available while I search for a really good, sturdy burr grinder..."
2,Worked great for a short time,"Like many other reviewers, I was quite pleased with the grinder at first. After grinding a few pounds of coffee I had the same problem with clogging. I tried cleaning it by running a pipe cleaner through it over and over which just BARELY helped. The unit is unusable for espresso. It will not feed any beans into the grinder reliably. I got what I think was an excellent deal for the Briel Brazil espresso machine plus grinder and base to hold the two for only $168 but don't spend $100 for this grinder. Two generally accepted excellent grinders available are the Rancilio Rocky and Gaggia MDF. each will run closer to $200. I also heard some good things about the Solis Mulino for about $125 but it doesn't have the doser attachment. good luck!"
3,"Work with the machine, not against it !","Yes -- it throws coffee all over the counter -- simply place a paper towel under the doser, sliding it up the back a little, when you turn it off, fold up the paper towel and throw it out. The doser really leaves little room -- just take the filter out of the transporter and place it directly below the doser (be sure to hold it snug against the stop ---..."
1,Doser too short,"I bought this grinder for doser feature so I could dose right into my espresso basket. The area between the doser and the bottom is too small, so it this feature is useless."
1,Briel Model CG-5 Coffee Grinder,"I use this product exclusively for espresso. Initially this grinder worked great. However, within 2 months the system became clogged with finely ground coffee causing the motor to seize. It was impossible to clean well enough to solve the problem. In addition the owners manual was totally lacking in describing what to do when a problem like this arises. I use the product on a daily basis therefore the warning not to leave coffee in the container for an extended period of time was worthless. Finally, the manual gives no hints about how one would contact Briel."
3,Mess can be avoided! Good grinder after all,"This grinder works reasonably well. I was concerned by the comments others added about the mess and the doser. I found that most of the mess is caused by ground coffee not dropping out of the doser. You can remedy this by giving the grinder a slight whack with each dose to be sure the chamber has emptied. It's a bit of a pain, but I've found it works for me. To be sure that the doses are consistent, be sure the ground chamber is reasonably full."
2,What a mess,"Functionally works great, lots of settings, grinds perfectly. Great coffee/ espresso.BUT . . . when grinding it spews grounds from every imaginable place. The plastic container also gains a static electric charge when grinding, so when you open the cover coffee is thrown out.Don't buy."
2,messy,"The grinding is OK, But you can't touch the unit with out getting coffee grinds on the counter, etc.,doser is useless ! cost me over $100. putting a paper towel under it & holding it together while grinding(as said in other reviews)is a bit lame for a unit of this price !"
2,No Staying Power,"This grinder worked fairly well when new, but now I'm looking for a new one, definitely not a Briel. I grind my coffe fairly fine, and the output feed from the burr grinders constantly jams with ground coffee necessitating a messy and frustrating cleaning every couple days. In addition, after about a year of use the input from the bean canister to the grinders is not working properly. The grinder spins but no beans go into the grinder. Another messy and frustrating cleaning."
1,Not worth the money.,"The doser just doesn't work. It dispenses a tottally random amount of ground esspresso every time you pull the handle. It's also very messy, shooting grinds all over the place.It's made from [inexpensive] plastic and is manufactured with poor tolerance. It 'feels' like a [inexpensive store] style grinder."
1,Dont waste a year of Grinding,This is the least expensive burr grinder with a doser I could find - that should have been my 1st clue!the product arrived with a broken hopper and the wrong color - clue #2finally get to grind some beans - but my portafilter wont fit under the doser... so I improvise and fill the basket instead - clue #3while grinding this machine creates so much static electricity that it'll shock your hand if you get too close - clue #4two months into using the machine a bean gets jammed... need a screw driver to remove ( this happens 4 more times ) - clue #5Eleven months and 15 days (just shy of one full year) I smell smoke coming from the unit .. box it up and ship it off to the Mfg for warrenty repair ... email just arrived ... $70 for a new motorGET A CLUE DONT WASTE A YEAR! OR $100

1,Briel CG5B Java Heavy-Duty Coffee Grinder,I needed a grinder to use with a drip coffee machine and an espresso machine. I chose the Briel CG5B Java Heavy-Duty Coffee Grinder because it came with an espresso doser. When I got the grinder I attached the doser and put in some beans to grind. I was very pleased with the ability to grind coffee as fine or coarsely as you could ever want but I was very disappointed by the doser. It just doesn't work. The coffee gets clogged and doesn't come out until it can fall onto the counter and create a huge mess. This grinder will grind coffee but it feels flimsy and is more trouble than it is worth. There are lots of coffee grinders and many for better prices. Choose one of them.
2,I'll Pass on this one !,"I received my Briel CG5B Java Heavy-Duty Coffee Grinder. I have to tell you that I'm a big Espresso drinker, so looking forward to trying my new ginder out for the first time. I attached the dispenser for pre-measured amount of ground coffee. Cool feature right ? Nope ! I turn the Grinder on and watched ground coffee fly on to my counter top from the bottom of the despenser. Ok, I attached the storage container and Ground some coffee into it. I poured the coffee in a Jar that I use to seal my coffee to keep fresh. But this made a mess also. The grind of the coffee at the lowest setting is still to course for my liking. So I decide to ship this item back. To put icing on the Cake. (...) I have purchased a much better coffee grinder for half of the sale price that lasted for four years. The motor in my opinion is far from heavy-duty or a professional Grinder. Well, I'm off to buy another Coffee grinder! Thank you for you time."
4,ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY,I did not read the book as I bought it for my daughter. But evaluating my order. The book came in record time. Wayyyy before the estimated arrival time I was given. It was on the doorstep in just a couple days from my order date. That is definatly a PLUS.
2,Christian book in disguise,"I can sum this book up really easily: lots of women get PPD. Take medication, grasp at any and all support sources (your own parents and husband, especially), and accept Jesus as your savior."
3,Helpful,I found this book very helpful when I was first diagnosed with PPD. Knowing there were other women out there that had experienced similar feelings made me feel not quite so alone.
5,Soooo helpful,This book made me feel comforted and not alone when I was feeling depressed after giving birth to my twins. I highly recommend it.
4,REALLY GOOD READ,It gave me a good understanding that I wasn't alone...and it's nice to relate to people that completely understand what u are going through. I think it gives a very broad range of people who have suffered so that everyone who has had PPD can relate to at least a few people. Very encouraging that you WILL make it through to the other side...I am in PPD so it has been a good comfort for my mental health that I will get through this.
4,Good replacement,"Well made replacement for older model Panasonic 12v which lasted 7 years - - the trigger operation does jump from very slow to fast rather abruptly - I would prefer a more gradual, smoother transition."
2,Doesn't seem to be real Sandalwood scent,"i was looking forward to this powder, but am disappointed because i specifically wanted the sandalwood scent. This is more perfumey (sandalwood ""fragrance"") not really sandalwood - and too strong for my taste. Someone else might appreciate it but i think i'll try the mysore powder."
2,Cheap.... and I don't mean just the price,"Comfort Wheels start out quiet and seem great, but after a month or two, the plastic axle wears down and becomes so loose that the wheel becomes too loud to tolerate. I was buying a new 5.5"" Comfort Wheel every other month for my Roborovskiis until I finally took up the suggestion of others and bought a Wodent Wheel. Wodent Wheels are completely silent, and I swear by them.If you have the funds to be spending $5 every 2 months for a new wheel, go for it. I perosnally would rather spend $10 on a wheel I never have to replace."
4,Not too shabby,I received this item as it should have been received. My only complaint is that I recieved it at a later date than I had anticipated.
1,piece of crap,"i hate this wheel and its not worth the cheep price. For one it isnt durable at all, my 2 hamsters destroyed it in about 3 days. Also this wheel is so loud that it has woken me up during the night. All in all go spend the extra money and get the silent spinner."
2,worst ever no good rotten wheel,I bought this wheel and put it in my hamster's cage.i watched her at first it clanked then binged then it just broke ! this is a very bad prouet for hamster maybe a rat would like them but not a hamster.
4,Nice,"I bought two of these for my colony of Dwarf hamsters and they really seemed to like them. It is the perfect size for most dwarves. the plastic screw does tend to get chewed up and becomes clanky and a little squeaky but a little olive or vegtable oil helps. These are much better than the supposed ""silent spinners"" which are too narrow, go to fast and are far from silent."
3,better than 1633 less than 1632,This book is much better than the previous sequel 1633 but not near as good as 1632 which started the series. This one right up front lets you know it is a collection of short stories unlike 1633 which was about 4 short stories intermixed haphazardly throughout the book with about 3 or 4 hundred pages of boring history and old plane safety and flying.The stories in Ring of Fire introduce new people and have occasional appearances of our heros and heroines from 1632 - some of the stories happen before 1633 and some after 1633. A few of the stories even had some of the joy and adventure which made 1632 so good. It was a nice look back into the Mr Flint's 1632 time frame by many authors but did not really advance the overall series much.Hopefully Mr. Flint will re-engage and put some effort into writing a real sequel.
4,Solid collection of stories.,"This collection of stories is a solid addition to the Ring of Fire world. The added characters rarely feel frivolous, and most of the stories maintain the tone and direction of the original books. A solid purchase for anyone that is interested in the world of 1632 and it's sequels."
2,So-so.,"Different authors bring different qualities to the table. This anthology is readable, but only just."
5,A great addition to the franchise,"Fans of 1632 and 1633 will definitely enjoy Ring of Fire! Eric Flint follows the path of many previous writers, allowing various authors to ""explore the alternate history"" he created in his previous books. The result is a welcome expansion of characters and events that helps to flesh out the story of Grantville, the West Virginia town transplanted to 30 Years War Germany. The effects of American ideals of liberty on the repressive and absolutist rulers of early seventeenth century Europe are especially enjoyable to watch!"
3,Not as good as his early work,"I found this piece quite boring, in particular if one considers the early works by the composer. Compared to St. Luke passion, this is high quality (church) elevator music."
4,"Such an important time, relatively unknown","After finishing this book you should walk away with a new appreciation of the importance of this administration's decisions. The author doesn't spend much time on Harrison's administration (lasted about a month before he died) but the politics involved in making Harrison the president was very interesting. The great part of this book was the amount of resistance and trouble Tyler had in his bid to be respected as ""The President"". In addition to this Tyler was hit by wars, domestic economic troubles, party troubles and whatever else you can imagine a one term president could endure. He did expand the United States' territory and was relatively productive which I wasn't aware of before reading this. In summary, a very good account of the troubles of inherited presidency."
4,A GREAT ANALYSIS!!,"THIS BOOK IS TYPICAL OF THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS PRESS PRESIDENTIAL SERIES. GREAT INSITE OF THE GROWING UNITED STATES DURING OUR POLITCAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE UGLY SIDE OF PERSONAL POLITICS. INTRIGUE REACHED A FEVERED PITCH WITH LESSOR KNOWN INDIVIDUALS ELECTED AS PRESIDENT WHILE THE ICONS, CLAY, BENTON, WEBSTER AND CALHOUN HELD OUR COUNTRY IN THE SENATE."
1,Not What I expected,I found this book to be repetitive regarding information and the central character to be too self-involved and whiney for my taste. These problems distracted me from the substance of the novel and made it an effort to read. I did find the incorpratioon of Cherokee language interesting.
3,Easy for travel but...,"it's made of plastic, so it's pretty flimsy. Easy to roll up or fold to bring somewhere, but other than that, it's not super useful."
1,A comlete waste of money,"This book is a complete waste of money. It looks nice and glittering, but in reality it is devoid of information. I had hoped for some specific information on Norfolk terriers, as Im the happy owner of a Norfolk puppy. It is difficult to convey the extend of my disappointment with this book. Its gives me an impression like: get a lot of pictures, make an ""change all"" in a standardtekst from xx to Norfolk and you have a book on Norfolks. It doesnt even have a race-standard, let alone an explanation of the race-standard. Or specified instruktions on stripping or trimming or..... Besides I find it extremely irritating, that there is a lot of advertizing, disguized as information. Avoid this book if you are serious about your Norfolk. What you can try to do is get hold of the old book on Norfolk by Joan R. Read. It looks a bit oldfacioned, but it is full of information. and it is much, much better."
5,This book is PAWSOME,"This book is pawsome! It covers all you need to know about Norfolk Terrier care,trimming,special needs,sicknesses prone to the breed,as well as some very interesting facts about Norfolk Terrier history as well as to how the breed came about. I feel that this book is wonderful and I rate it 10 paws up! If you love Norfolk Terriers I feel you will enjoy this book as much as I did!"
4,Two sides to an opinion,"i read this book whilst I was ill in bed as well. It didn't make me feel like dying it actually made me feel better. Its a wonderfully touching book and deserves to be read, it only took me a few hours! Other reviewers mark it as a disappointment, I can see their point, however I think partly why they see it as such a let-down is because it is the exact point of view of a child and maybe is meant more for children or adults trying to see into their little worlds. When you're ill you tend to feel a bit like a child, being cared for by someone else, that could be why I liked it so much. There is fine line between having the talent to write from another perspective e.g a childs, and just failing to produce the standard of work aimed for. But I think to understand this piece you need to understand whos speaking the words, a child!"
3,A little disappointing...,"This book was quite disappointing when compared to Sophie's World, which was much more in depth. Through a glass, darkly had a lot of potential and would have been brilliant had it explored the issues raised like God, death and life, in more detail. This novel felt rushed and was not as enthralling as its forerunners. Still not bad, just don't expect the same quality of Sophie's World."
2,Empty space,"Written by the author of Sophies world, boasts to this tune feel as though they take up every empty space of the book, and to be honest the whole book feels like empty space.I expected to be taken on a wild ride that would ultimatley leave me questioning my pre concieved ideas of the world, unfortunatley it's just the tale of a sick little girl and her Angel.Not one to give up on a book I read every single last word, (much to the dismay of my friends I might add!)It's not badly written, there are no glaring oversights and it's entirely tolerable, however I was just frustrated the whole way trough, some books take you on a rollercoaster of emotions but this was just a flatline of dissapointment.There's not much more I can say, I wouldn't recommend it to a friend but if I were doing a book exchange I'd mail it off and not lose any sleep over it.headlinesandheroes.tumblr.com (more book reviews for your delectation)"
3,i was expecting more,"i am an avid fan of mr. gaarder's work, but this one's quite a dissapointment. he's been covering the same subject, dealt with the same issues in all of his books, but i find that ""the solitaire mystery"" and ""the christmas mystery"" were more creative. in fact, i read this book about the same time as ""hello, is anybody out there?"" & to be quite honest i think they're not much different. it was not memorable, at least to me anyway. a friend asked me about this book earlier today, actually, and i was surprised myself when i couldn't recall the exact story, i kept confusing it with ""hello,..."" when i can recite the other mr.gaarder's stories by heart."
4,A hidden gem!,"I came across this while browsing in a library in Providence. What a neat little collection! Nothing trendy, nothing hip, just a nice variety of styles and stories about Rhode Island."
5,handy little gadget,"I've owned this product for over a year and I'm still very pleased with it. It is a great 'cheater' device for making fancy coffee drinks. If you heat the milk (I use the microwave) and then whip it with this, you get an effect similar to steamed milk from an espresso machine. It may not satisfy a true cappuccino aficionado, but it works for me. It is also perfect for mixing up some hot chocolate - no more lumps! It gets fairly regular use and I don't think I have changed batteries yet, so no complaints in that area."
2,OK- but underpowered,Not as good as the bonjour which was out of stock when I bought this as a back up. kind of wimpy
2,for people who know zero about surfing,"This book covers some areas well such as technique, and the dangers of surfing. But it left me with many questions, almost as if this were half a book. This book is for people who have never seen a surfboard in their life."
1,Not very useful,"The author clearly didn't have anywhere near enough to say to make a book, so he filled this one with all kinds of useless trivia, like ""look out for jellyfish."" We don't need someone to tell us that. A lot of the book is a sort of dictionary, but he shows his ignorance in many of the entries. He appears to be just another person with limited knowledge, trying to jump on the surf bandwagon. I totally agree with another reviewer who recommended going to the beach and paying attention, instead of wasting your time and money on this book."
1,Save yourself the money and go to the beach,"For what is useful in this book, go to the beach for an afternoon and watch some surfers - you'll get just as much out of it - probably more."
1,Learn to Surf?,"It just so happens that the person on the cover of this book is in fact riding a SKIMBOARD, not a surfboard. I just find it rather amusing that the cover of a surfing book displays a skimboarder and assumes it is a surfer. Alot of people don't know about wave-riding skimboarding, so I guess that explains it. But I do find it amusing."
1,The Worst,"I've been a faithful customer of Kensington for years, and I bought one of these because it was pretty and shiny.While it definitely was aesthetically pleasing, it was the poorest ergonomically engineered trackball/mouse I've ever owned.My hand pain was worse with this thing, than a regular mouse.I personally recommend the Kensington 4-Button Expert Mouse USB/PS2 Trackball. It may not be as sexy, but it's easier on the hands (my hand at least.) Kensington Guys: Go back to the drawing board and keep the Ugly White Expert Mouse on the market."
3,"Good Performance and features, but...",This mouse does work nicely and I have had no real tech problems with day to day use. It is however a major power hog. It goes through batteries faster than any mouse I have ever owned. The only complaint I have is that it tends to really kill my batteries during game play. That is a real bummer when you are trying to dodge a rocket... :)
1,Imperfect Technology,"My Kensington wireless mouse, new out of the box, would lose connection several times a day. Frustrating? You betcha - I went back to a wired mouse after it was clear there wasn't a solution but a permanent deficiency in the technology, at least in the Kensington."
4,Expert! Wireless trackball,"This device is excellent for me. I have limited space and could never stay on a mouse pad, no wires on my desk. I get much less had,arm, shoulder, and back stiffnes/soreness. I do use the wrist rest. Actually my doctor reccommended a track ball and my regular one became worn out to quickly. I also use this for photography work requiring some fine movements and it works quite well."
1,Too Many Examples DO NOT WORK,"I hate to write a bad review. I really do. But here's the deal: if you're just starting out with ActionScript, and you type in some of the examples in the book (several, actually) they will not work.This is frustrating beyond belief.I'm using FMX 2004 Pro, and every other example of code that I've tried to use just flat out will not work.Sorry."
3,An OK book for programmers,"I have been a professional programmer for about ten years now, and recently started working on ActionScript-heavy Flash applications. I don't really find this book that usefull.A lot of the examples are obvious explanations of the AS documentation (eg, how to set the background of a TextField). Others should be know by any programmer (eg, how to loop through an array). Seemingly usefull functions, like recursively stopping everything in a MovieClip, are missing.If you are a seasoned programmer, I would pass on this. If you are a beginning programmer, this may be handy."
5,Make room on your desk for a new permanent addition,"I received this book 2 weeks ago and have not put it down. The author did a phenomenal job breaking down problems and could not have been any clearer on his solutions to the problem. This is not a how to book, rather it is the friend you're looking for at 3am when nobody else is awake. I have yet to run across something that I couldn't find the answer to in the AS Cookbook! I highly recommend this book to any Flash/ActionScript developer. Thumbs up to Joey Lott & O'Reilly."
1,Not useful at all,"I bought these because of the price and the see through bucket. I should have saved my money. I started getting into enemas becuase of the Gerson coffe enema. I had already purchased the expensive stainless steel bucket, nice 5/15 hoses and a good nozzle. But - can't see how much of the enema has been taken. So, I thought if I get one of these plastic buckets and use with my good hose - then I can see how much I have taken. But.... the outlet of the bucket is much too small for my hose - it only seems to fit the hose that came with the bucket - and that is useless. It is soo coiled I could barely uncoil it to use. There is no actual tip. Just the end of the hose is closed off with holes in it. The blue thing in the picture is a cover for the hose - it comes pre-lubricated.Anyway, I wound up throwing both of them out without using them (I bought two)."
4,Works as described,This product works and is as described. The only reason it didn't get a 5 star rating is because it only comes with one package of the stimulant to put in the water.
3,Shipping issues,"The product came in fine shape. The 1st shipment got lost.. not the shippers fault. I actually forgot I had ordered it and sent an email to the seller. I then got a shipment of ultrasound gel, addressed to me..... odd. and then a week later I received the actual order, without even advising them of the mistake. I wonder who's missing the ultrasound gel..."
5,All Things Considered,"This set comes with Enema bag and bucket.Included:2x tubes/hoses with pre lubed covered tips2x Castile soap2x drape2x stop flow valve thing on tubes1x bucket notched w/handles1x bag hangableItem is as described.Not much on the instruction side of things, though its simple enough to figure out.Only the Enema bag kit is sealed and the bucket kit is not(in closed bag). All in all for the price and what's included I find the item's to be of reasonable quality especially for the price. I would buy this item again. Meant for one time use but I guess it could be used again if properly sterilized.Recommended: Something to hang the bucket/bag at proper height. I used twine double looped on my shower curtain bar."
5,Great Enema Bucket at a Great Price,"I needed an enema bucket to do coffee enemas based on the Gerson Therapy so I bought one of these. At a little over $5 for the bucket, tubing, and shipping you can't beat the price. I have had this bucket for over 2 months now and have had done at least 50 enemas with it and have had no problems. I think I can easily use this for at least a year doing 2 + coffee enemas a day. The handle works perfectly as I hang it on a door knob in the bathroom which provides the right height when doing an enema. It's easy to clean too. It's nice that it's transparent so one can see how much of the enema liquid has been released and how much is left. With a stainless steel version, you wouldn't be able to see that. The enema bag that comes with it is pretty worthless, but for $5 who cares. The bucket and tube was all I wanted. It also shipped pretty fast. I think I got this within 3 to 4 days from ordering."
5,I have used this several times and it works well,I have used this several times and it works well. I have no complaints about this product. Works exactly as described.
2,Didn't come with everything.,The Enema Bag and Bucket Set didn't include the bag or the tip for easy insertion. I was disappointed. At least it was shipped on time.
2,No Enema Bag! Too Bad!,This set is supposed to come with the enema Bag.All I received is the bucket. Everything I received is fine. ButI really want to have the bag too.It's bad to deceive people with false advertising.
1,"A ""forged"" knife isn't stamped!","This item, called ""forged"" in the title is listed as stamped in the description, which may be an indication why so many people are not happy with their purchase. Purchase forged knives for the best quality."
3,"Hoan? Pusan, Korea? Who Fritz?","Didn't mind Hoan -- they sometimes can be quality.Did mind Pusan, Korea, as the place the blades were made (possibly the whole knife with handle too). Not Germany, not even close.Did mind that most of the blades were sharpened on one side only, and that the scissors were quite short.Plus side: they were quite sharp, and the sharpening stone was a nice change from the usual serrated tool.First knife set: quite nice. Upgrade set? Not really.Definitely not a gourmet set."
2,Dull Knives,"These knives look nice and are sturdy, but frankly I found myself sharpening them upon my first use. For the money, I think you can do better."
2,Downloading problems...,I would love watching the old MST movies if my ipod didn't buffer every few minutes. I won't sign up for Amazon Prime now that I know what I'd have to deal with. I'm disappointed.
4,Movie sucks but riffing is good,"Two points re:this episode1. The ""star"" of this flick is, what I would call, ""the poor man's Jean Claude Van Damme"". Looks like him, more or less.2. The funniest riff comes early in the show when the Jean Claude lookalike guy is fighting with an out of shape, pudgy android. They mostly throw empty cardboard boxes at each other. Mike riffs, ""Battle of the guys who peaked in high school"".Overall, a pretty decent episode."
5,"Superlative as an Appetizer, or Even Atop Dessert !","I've found that this dried squid is perfect for use as an appetizer at parties -- it can be placed by itself in small bowls around the room, or can be served on trays with assorted dips (horseradish, or mustard, or beet puree) to positively punctuate any sort of social gathering. The smaller tips of the tentacles are deliciously crunchy, while the larger parts are delightfully rubbery (dicing some of the rubbery parts into raisin-sized bits, and serving them atop scoops of vanilla ice cream, presents a dessert surprise your guests will talk about for decades!).Be aware, this flavor is unique and cannot be mirrored by using some cheaper product, such as smoked oysters or octopus, or crusted pate. This is the real thing... ENJOY !"
4,I'm impressed,"I stumbled on Ms Hart's website a couple of weeks ago and listened to selections from her CD there. For bargain shoppers, the CD can be bought direct for $10.00 which includes shipping if you want to use Paypal. I don't use Paypal (or any other third party source for credit card orders) and I was delighted to see that Amazon has the recording available. It's worth it to me to pay the premium.Anyway, I've only listened to the CD once. It doesn't impress me as being traditional jazz but it does impress me. Her voice has a touch of Stevie Nicks but is much smoother. The style of music is tilted toward lighter rock as opposed to what I consider real jazz. I suppose that's what is referred to as ""smooth jazz"" these days. No matter how you label it, this CD is nice to listen to and I would recommend it to anyone who loves female vocalists--but maybe not to those who only love traditional female jazz vocalists."
3,"Great products, horrible mailing policy","I redeemed live caterpillar coupon at insect lore website and received a confirmation e-mail stating ""We'll notify you with another email when your order ships."" but not hear about the shipment. When I checked my mailbox I find out the dead caterpillars. I really disappointed with the shipment method. Company did not notify me about the shipment via e-mail as they stated in the confirmation e-mail and send the caterpillars with an ordinary mail to my mailbox even though I paid about 5$ for the shipment. These are live animals and shipping them at these hot summer days needs more responsibility. When I contact to company they promised to send me a prepaid redeem coupon but still I am sad for the dead caterpillars."
1,Bait and Switch -Beware you will have to pay an extra $5,This is a horrible company!! This product does not cost $14.88. All you get for this price is a large fabric bag. You have to contact the company for the butterflies (caterpillers) and when you do they tell you it is going to cost another $5. That brings the price up to $20 not what is advertised.
4,loved it,my girls loved doing this... everyone should try it. It is very easy to use and set up. And the kids will never leave the area
5,Heather,We purchased this item as a Christmas gift for our daughter. We sent away for the caterpillars this spring. I was impressed that I received the caterpillars during the week that I requested. We enjoyed watching the caterpillars proceed through their life cycle. We received 5 live caterpillars and today we are setting free 5 live butterflies. Very enjoyable product
5,butterflies becoming,The Live Butterfly Garden is even cooler than we thought it would be.It's great to have a long-term project that doesn't provide instant gratification. It's interesting and fun.
4,Process To Remember,"All 5 larvae made chrysalides; but only 3 hatched out to be butterflies. We bought the host plants and plants they like to eat hoping that they would hang around; but alas, they began their long flight immediately upon release. I think my 6 year old will remember the process all her life."
5,Butterfly garden for children,Live Butterfly GardenThe live butterfly garden habitatwas just perfect. Along with the garden we ordered a book about insectsand butterflys to encourage curiousity and a learning adventure. I was happy with the intrest and excitement along each step of the butterflylifespan until the moment of release. My child was eager to learn all he could and take care of these little creatures who did some amazing things along the way. He would ask questions-such as why did the cocoon just wiggle and instead of us finding the answers he would go to the internet and look them up or search his book. The butterflys were beautiful. For a heads up when they mature you will need a orange or source of food unless it is warm enough in your area to release. They will not survive in cold climates. Shipping was great and it is a easy to store kit that you can either pass along for others to enjoy or keep for future bug findings.
1,Company is impossible to reach to get caterpillars/butterflies!,"I received the butterfly garden over a week ago and have tried every day to contact the seller to get the caterpillars delivered. It is impossible to get through to them. The phone is always busy, their website doesn't work, and the do not respond to email. I am completely dissatisfied and would not recommend ordering from this company.Also, if we are ordering online anyway, why not just send the caterpillars with the kit??"
3,Cute but Much better to Find your own Caterpillars,"I bought one of these to raise and release some Black swallowtail Caterpillars I found at work last year. The kit itself is fine and does work to keep them safe from being eaten, but I dislike the fact you can order caterpillars through mail. I wouldn't ever think of sending away for someone to ship me live insects. It can't be very healthy for them and seems like a cruel thing to do. Instead of paying $5 to ship sick or dead caterpillars look in your own backyard. Do some research into what butterflies are in your area and plant host plants that those butterflies lay eggs on. Then use the kit to raise and release your Butterfly. Better for the caterpillar and saves you from having upset kids."
2,"Extra S&H fee $5.00, plus personal info","I don't know how much this product will bring my family latter, but I am really unhappy about extra $5.00 to pay, plus fill out the card with personal info and credit card info. I rather pay everything up front via Amazon, then just mail a postcard to request the live caterpillar.Not a good gift idea. It will be bad that give it as a gift. The gift receiver will have to pay extra $5.00, or they don't want to pay & give out their personal info, then you wasted what you payed."
1,Does NOT include caterpillars. They cost extra!,"Yes, it's great to watch caterpillars grow, but this is NOT a kit to hatch them. The price you pay is for a pop up butterfly tent and a plastic pipette. The caterpillars cost you an additional $5.I received this as a gift and was really disappointed I had to pay to get the caterpillars. Buyers, beware."
2,Beware...,"The CATERPILLARS are NOT included and you have to pay $5.oo to get them shipped. What a joke. The TV commercial advertises ""call now and get 2 sets of caterpillars"", well, you have to pay extra and WAIT for them to be shipped! VERY disappointed! We haven't played with it yet. Still waiting for the Caterpillars!"
2,lame extra costs,"I was really disappointed to find that I had to send off to get the catipellers after the package came. Then they never came. Pretty lame! I do like the idea, lets just hope someone else copies the concept and makes it better with better customer service."
1,DEAD BUGS,I purchased this for my 7 year old daughter for christmas. I was guarenteed 3 live larve.They are all dead and I can not get ahold of the company. I would rate this a big Zero
2,Not exactly what we thought...,"The item arrived right on time, but it wasn't clear to me that you have to order the caterpillars separately AND you have to pay an additional $5.00 AND pay postage to send in the form. This might turn out to be really neat,educational, durable,we don't know yet- but it should show in big print that there's additional effort and cost required. This stuff isn't easy to explain to an exicted 5 yr old"
1,Insect Lore Live Butterfly Garden,"Very disappointing. The product was damaged and it didn't come with butterflies. It is misleading marketing and packaging as you think it is a butterfly garden equipt with butterflies, similar to the lady bug lands but your 5 year old nephew will quickly point out with a frowny face that there is nothing in the box worth his time :("
1,Won't ship larvae to Hawaii.,Bummer!!! Would of loved to try this out. Just a warning to other island folk. Hope to find something similar that's island approved.
4,butterflies,the butterfly garden is a perfect place to house the the chrysalides until they are transformed into butterflies.
5,wonderful,"this was for my 4yr old son and 9 yr old daughter.This was great, we received 10 live caterpillars watched them eat and grow and turn into the crysilis attached the paper under the lid with a close pin to the butterfly container with in a few days they were butterflys.We soaked a sponge with humming bird food and watched them eat for 2 days then we let them go. Althrough 2 didnt turn in to butterflys so we only had 8 to let go. but its a great life lesson for $30 total. We are born we grow up and one day fly away to live life for our own. If you want these to hang around your yard get some butterfly attracting plants."
3,Beautiful butterflies,"I got this from Target in March and went back to get more to give as gifts, but they were all gone. We got the caterpillars on May 3 as we requested and they were growing already! About a week later, they all formed cocoons and a week after that, all 5 butterflies emerged. I have to mention that I was very careful with the caterpillars and cocoons around the kids and my 5 and 3 year olds were allowed to look, but not touch. They are interested in the butterflies, but do not seem to understand the wonder of having watched the transformation from caterpillar to butterfly. They will not put their hands in the net to put in the flowers or orange slices, since the butterflies flutter around. I will get another in a couple of years and maybe they will appreciate it more."
3,Would've been so much fun,"Our caterpillars weren't moving much upon arrival, but the instructions said that was normal. So we followed everything to the dot, including waiting by the mailbox for the delivery! The caterpillars' movements reduced to zero and eventually I decided they had passed on. We did not get much out of this kit, unfortunately. Perhaps summer of 2010 was too hot for postal insects! We did use the mesh cage several times capturing live butterflies in our garden. Even some fireflies. Got something out of it, I guess."
3,Live butterfly,"It took longer to arrive. It must have come on a late Friday or Saturday delivery, but sat untill Monday. I usually check the mail, but that Saturday I was out of town. It was the hottest weekend. The containers were sticky and smelly. I opened the netting and placed the cocoons as directed. I waited and waited, at the end 3 of the butterflies must of been dead and another died which only left 1, he soon died because his wings were damaged. Horrible to watch. Won't do this again.NL"
2,$3.00 and 3 weeks to receive larve in mail. Dissapointed.,This was a dissapointing gift for a child.When you receive the kit you have to mail in a postcard (or go online) and pay $3.00 to order the larve. But the it takes up to 3 weeks to receive them in the mail.The box contains the screen habitat and an instruction booklet. That's it.
1,Misleading Video,Caveat Emptor...i.e. buyer beware. Dont get your kid excited by watching the video. Because you get the kit in a few days but then realize that it doesnt include the larvae...so you have to deal with a disappointed kid and a wait time for the larvae.i realize the fine print kind of represents this however the video is very misleading.
1,Inhumane..,"As a preschool teacher, I thought this product would be tons of fun for the kids. They would be witnessing the stages of life unfold right before their eyes. Wrong! I witnessed weak/dying larva and dying butterflies scattered all over in a small canister upon opening the package. It looked like they had been thrown every direction possible in the journey to our school. It made me sick to think that I played a role in their demise..the thought never crossed my mind that shipping could kill them! Therefore, I feel the need to warn anyone else that may be considering this purchase. Check out the other one star comments-there are many that say the same thing. I can't imagine who would dislike these comments as well..hmm..maybe the people who would not be gaining profit?! Save yourself some money and heartache by just exploring the wildlife around you!"
2,disappointing-had to purchase caterpillars for the initial project.,"Very disappointing. When my granddaughter received this gift, she found that there were no caterpilars to watch, and infact had to wait to purchase the crystallis before she could do anything! Very disappointing!"
4,Gift,This was a gift. I am only typing this because the site is forcing me too. I bought this as a gift.
3,Tumble Buggy,Children Toys:Purchased two cars for grandchildren. One conked out after 30 minutes. (give me toys) was fast to replace it. Great Vendor but product may have a few flaws but not the vendor's fault. The price was good and I would buy from this Vendor again if Amazon did not have in stock.
1,Poor product.,Only one larvae lived to hatch and it had a broken wing. Not a good outcome for my 5 year old to enjoy
2,Be prepared to wait,"I made the mistake of thinking this would be a creative Birthday present. First you receive the net habitat. Now you have to pay to get the actual larvae. Ours were lost, and no one wanted to help. They don't track the package so you are at their mercy. Finally we received the little creatures and they became butterflies while we were away on vacation.:("
4,fun but be aware of the extra costs,"My son (aged 5) and I loved this toy, both fun and educational--and all 5 of our caterpillars survived to be released. We received this as a gift and although I didn't mind paying the extra $3 to ship the caterpillars, Insect Lore now has a version you can purchase from their site that includes the live bugs already in the box in case that's an issue for the gift giver. My only complaint is that the cost to order replacement butterflies seems awfully high."
4,Fun,THe only downside is that when it comes to your door you have to send for the butterfly larvae. So I would recommend NOT having a little one open it up or wrap it and give it as a gift.
2,"Shipping takes forever,Never saw the caterpillar stage","It takes them forever to ship the larva to the east coast (there on the west), I actually called thinking it was lost and they sent out a new one, which also took several weeks to arrive. (I ended up with 2) By the time the larva arrives the caterpillar have formed into crystals. so you are missing out on a major part of the process. (I couldn't believe that a company which time is of the essence shouldn't take this in consideration)This company has a great product in theory, but is extremely under efficient in their distribution and shipping methods. If they could upgrade that you have a phenomenal product.I would love but wouldn't order from this company again. But I give it 2 stars since the concept of the product is amazing. (maybe if you live closer to them its faster)"
4,Great for tweens,i bought this for my 9 yr old niece for her birthday. She was so thrilled with it. Very educational and entertaining!
4,Butterfly Garden,"I really enjoyed watching the caterpillars grow & turn to butterflies. I had trouble attaching the paper disc to the top of the habitat; it was so fragile, but they hatched just as easy lying at the bottom."
4,BE VERY CAREFUL IF THE BUTTERFLY DIES IN YOUR HOUSE!!,"WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I HAD SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND THE BUTTERFLYS WERE GREAT EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT WHEN ONE OF THEM DIED, WE HAD TONS OF BABY CATERPILLARS RUNNING AROUND THE HOUSE!! I WENT TO THE LIBRARY AND GOT A BOOK ON REPRODUCTION IN BUTTERFLYS AND IT SAID THAT BEFORE THE BUTTERFLY DIES THEY HAVE TONS OF BABIES. PLEASE JUST WATCH OUT FOR THAT!! OTHER THEN THAT IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIANCE!!"
1,Insect Lore... POOR Customer Service...still no larvae,"I assume that this product would receive a 5 star educational value rating, but I don't know since it has been a month and a half since I ordered the the larvae and I have still not received it. Three weeks ago, I sent the Insect Lore an email letting them know the larvae hadn't arrive and the CEO and founder, Pat White, promptly replied with the shipment date (that it, not a hello or anything), which was almost a month ago. After sending Pat a follow-up email, she never replied. Since then I have sent two more inquiries and Pat has never replied, nor have I received the larva. My daughters are pretty sad about this. I am frustrated. Not sure if there is another company that sells butterfly larvae, but you may want to save yourself the money and hassle and order this kind of product somewhere else if you can.Very disappointing."
1,Very Disappointing,We followed the directions perfectly but did not have a single butterfly. All 5 caterpillars died at various stages. My 6 year old granddaughter was very disappointed and cried each time one died.
1,Beware,"I bought this for my classroom this past year. I sent in payment for the butterfly larvae in March by mid April had received no larvae from the company that makes this item. I wrote a complaint and they sent me the ""larvae"" in the mail which was just the food and NO larvae in a small container. I again sent a complaint to the company. They responded they would send me a replacement a week later. The replacement came and again no worms. I would have written a complaint on their website but there was no place for one. Beware of this company! My first graders and I were disappointed! I have a feeling this company sent me no worms purposely because of my complaint. I didn't even see a dead worm; only food."
5,Great Learning Experience for my Son and Me!,"This product delivered just as promised! I expected to get dead caterpillars or something lame. Nope! Once I mailed off the enclosed card for live caterpillars, they arrived in a week or less!We are in the pupa stage now and are awaiting our beauties!Great product! And you can re-use the net part. Just go buy some dill at the herb store! I did and had 14 little fellas! (ps they look like specks of dirt at first!) Be sure to buy LOTS of dill, as these guys will double in size daily!"
5,Love It,"I have two kids, a 4 and 5 year old. We all loved our butterfly habitat. The caterpillars were so much fun to watch. It was easy to order them. My kids especially enjoyed feeding the butterflies. We liked seeing which flowers they liked best. My kids also liked squeezing the sugar water onto paper towels. We are going to order more caterpillars soon.The one thing to be careful about is that the adult butterflies can get their wings caught in the bottom seam of the habitat. I just don't feel like I could keep them over the winter with that in mind. They really should be let go pretty quickly after emerging."
5,FUN & EDUCATIONAL,"I bought this for my Grandson and sent it to him. It was a hit withhim. It's one thing to read about butterflies in a book, but a wholedifferent level to watch them grow and let them go, and feel you've hada part in their care. Highly recommend."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I THOUGHT I WAS ORDERING THE WONDERFUL KIT WE HAD LAST YEAR BY THE SAME NAME. INSTEAD, I GOT A SMALLER HABITAT AND NO LARVAE - HAVE HAD TO SEND AWAY FOR '3-5 LARVAE' FOR AN ADDITIONAL $5 AND A LONG WAIT. LAST YEAR WE GOT 10 LARVAE INCLUDED. I CAN'T TELL FROM THE WEBSITE IF THEY WILL ARRIVE IN THE CYLINDER OF FOOD LIKE LAST YEAR; MAYBE I'LL HAVE TO SEND NEXT FOR THE FOOD!THIS IS A SERIOUS DISAPPOINTMENT AFTER OUR AWESOME EXPERIENCE LAST YEAR."
1,You must order the butterflies separately / coupon code doesn't work,"Because the pictures of the product on Amazon show larvae and butterflies, and there is no disclosure that extra purchase is required, I assumed that this was a complete kit. However you must purchase additional butterflies (and when you go to the Insect Lore website you see that this ""kit"" costs just over 8 dollars). My enclosed coupon code for the ""free"" larvae (actually $3.00 for shipping) didn't work, either. Extra cost and hassle."
3,Disappointed,"Several years ago one of my sons was given this as a birthday gift and found great joy watching the caterpillars make the cocoons and then emerge as butterflies. So I bought one for my niece and nephews who live in another state. However, instead of just needing to send the card in to get the caterpillars, they had to pay an additional $3 as well!!! What?!?! I already PAID for this! I realize $3 is not a lot of money, but I was very disappointed that there was an additional hidden cost. Plus, they sent off for it about three weeks ago and to my knowledge have not gotten the caterpillars yet. If they don't recv them soon, I will file a complaint with Amazon.I gave this high marks for ""fun"" and ""educational"", but that is based on the assumption they actually get to do it."
3,Live Butterfly Garden,"The ""idea"" of the Live Butterfly Garden is a wonderful one, as long as the caterpillars arrive when the customer requests! We were unable to order the ""free"" caterpillars online, so we sent in the order form via snail mail. When I contacted the company after the request date, I was told that they must have been ""lost in the mail""! I have now requested that the replacement caterpillars be delivered on 8-24-09.Meanwhile, we arrived home from our two-week vacation, to a container of dead caterpillars! This has NOT been a F-U-N experience for our child! We can only hope & pray that the caterpillars we requested, arrive on the 24th (alive and well)!"
5,Fantastic and interesting for the whole family,"This butterfly habitat is such a great gift. I've given it as a gift a few times and always get excited phone calls from them when they get their caterpillars in the mail and again when the butterflies appear.The package and description clearly shows that you have to mail away for the larvae so as long as kids understand that when opening, it's not at all disappointing... quite the opposite. Kids love anticipating fun things coming in the mail. I'm happy to now be able to buy this for my 4 year old daughter who loves all things science and I can't wait to get our caterpillars :)"
5,We really enjoyed it!,The caterpillars arrived pretty quickly after we sent the card in to request them. They were super teeny but quickly ate their way up to a chunky size. We were amazed at how quickly they beefed up! All 5 survived. We really enjoyed watching them emerge and releasing them into our garden after a day or two of keeping them in the observation box. This was very educational. It gave the kids a great appreciation of butterflies.
5,"Fun, educational, and really cool, too!","I bought this kit for my 5-year-old, but my 3-year-old wound up loving it every bit as much as the older one. The caterpillars arrive in a sealed container with everything they need--all you have to do is observe them. After a week, we placed the cocoons in the habitat, and out hatched five gorgeous butterflies. What's more, they began laying eggs within a few days, and before you know it, we had DOZENS of teeny-tiny baby caterpillars! Of course, we set them free outside (I'm no bug farmer), and we enjoyed painted lady butterflies throughout the rest of the summer. This kit provided my children with a wonderful, exciting learning experience that they will never forget!"
2,"Cute, but not a great company","My 4-year old loves it for about 2 minutes each day. It's not very ""fun"" until you can release the butterflies, since the container just sits there, but it's still a good learning experience.However, I had an issue with the company from which you have to order the caterpillars. My voucher said it costs $3 for processing of the larvae, but I was charged $5. And then instead of the 5 larvae I was supposed to get, I got 2. How much fuss does one want to make over a $3/$5 charge? I have enough on my plate to waste time going back-and-forth with the company. My initial contact with them received a quick response asking for order clarification, and then I never heard from them again. It's not a lot of money so I'm not losing sleep over it, but I imagine how much extra they can make ripping off lots of people a dollar here, a dollar there, a caterpillar here, a caterpillar there. I don't think it's a good company, and I wouldn't do business with them again on principal alone."
4,Growing Butterflies,My boys loved this gift from the Easter Bunny. Our butterflies just emerged this week and they loved seeing the process. Shipping of the caterpillars was quick. We faxed in the order to speed up the process. (You have to mail in a certificate to get the caterpillars afer you receive the kit. The certificate comes with the kit). I will need to clean the net soon due to excretions from the emerging butterflies so I am not exactly sure of the durability after washing. Very educational project! Much better than more toys that are not needed or candy!
4,LIttle over priced for what you get,"Over all I'm satisfied with the product even though the garden is just a mesh pop-up cylinder with a silkscreen image and it took over 2 weeks to get the larva. I guess it was my fault for under estimating the management of my 4 year old, getting the butterfly kit without the caterpillars. Though I immediately mailed the card with my $3, it took over 2 weeks to get the larva. Now that we have everything, he's very excited and checks them out everyday. It was just the management of getting the garden and then having him waiting. If I had to do it all over again, I would order a kit that came with everything all at once."
4,You have to order larvae separate,"The product was overall a good deal. My daughter was very excited about the whole process. I also bought a kids book to follow along the process. The advertesement on TV claims ""ten"" larvae. To ensure you receive live larvae, you have to send an order and $5 bucks. In a world of video games this is an inexpensive and fun activity for any young kids. You can even throw in a little learning."
5,Fantastic gift,"What a great gift from the Easter bunny. My kids aged 4 and 7 at the time, loved this gift. All but 1 one the ""worms"" developed and we were eventually left with 5 beautiful butterflies. My kids enjoy enjoyed the birthing process, feeding and letting the butterflies go. Every time we see a ""matching"" butterfly the 4 year old says, ""There's the butterfly we grew!"" It so sweet! You won't be disappointed!"
4,"Everything is great, except the undisclosed $5 charge for the larvae","Give this 4 stars and not 5 because they don't tell you that you have to send away for the larvae for a $5 charge and wait several weeks. if this were explained on the Amazon website, it would be a little easier to handle. As is, it is an unwelcome surprise.That said - a nice habitat, lots of room for 4 butterflies (which you send away for) and beautiful monarchs emerge at the end of the process."
4,Great fun for all ages,This is not my first time to purchase this great Butterfly kit. I have bought one before when my oldest daughter was young. IT is so fun for your kids to watch the process of the butterflies going through all the stages. My only disappointment is that you know have to pay for the caterpillars to be sent to you. I think this would be a great gift but only if you gave someone the $5 to mail off for the butterflies as well.
4,Great for the classroom!,"This is the second time I have used this particular brand of butterfly garden in my classroom. It is a great size for suspension from the ceiling or even a bulletin board, so that all of my students can view the process of metamorphosis as it occurs. I've used this in 7th and 8th grades and they have all been fascinated by the transformation. The butterfly garden itself can be used from year to year, clean it, spray it with disinfectant and store it opened up in the open air."
5,best project ever,"I'm a new homeschooling mom. I wanted something educational for my children ages 5,4,and 2. We got this and were so excited. We used our coupon code and bought our caterpillars online. They take about 4-5 days to come in the mail. We enjoyed watching how fast the caterpillars grew. We drew pictures and documented what we saw. The kids asked questions and were just fascinated. Even my husband got in on the fun. When they turned into butterfly's only one died shortly after it emerged from its chrysalis. The best part was letting them go. Each child was able to put a butterfly on their finger and let it go. It was a beautiful memory. I hope to do this again with my kids."
2,Extra Expense Involved!!!,"I just opened this up to see that you have to pay extra $$ for the shipping and handling o the butterflies. Sorry, but this should be included in the price. I already paid for this and should not have to pay more! I am looking forward to doing this with my daughterm but disappointed that I have to shell out more money to get what I already should have purchased."
4,Butterfly pavilion a big hit.,My grandson is 5 and really enjoyed the butterfly pavilion. A great educational tool!
3,Gross,"We are in the caterpillar stage right now, they are disgusting! These are not the pretty furry caterpillars we have in the midwest, they are slimy worms with a few hairs sticking out. My husband even says they are gross!! They spin webs at this stage and you can see their waste, and they are ugly and disgusting!! Think twice."
3,Hidden Cost,"I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter. We went online to order the live catepillars and found you had to pay another $5. I didn't mind, but this was misleading. They came quickly, crawled around for a few days, then made their cacoons. Two have already hatched. My daughter loves it, but it was very squicky having to pin the cup lid with the cacoons to the net cage."
5,A+++ Butterfly Kit,"I couldn't be more happy with this kit. Hardly any maintenance other than feeding butterflies with orange slices everyday. I love the way the caterpillars are self contained and self feeding so there's no worry in getting them to eat and drink. Out of the 5 caterpillars, one didn't make it but the rest developed normally and are now happy and healthy butterflies."
1,Never got it in the mail,I never got it in the mail...and i was telling a friend that also complained about how her order came late in the mail and when she opened it. It has all turned into butterflies...
1,Caterpillar Ordering is a Nightmare!!,"I have been trying to order the caterpillars for our kit for three weeks! They are still not here! I have waited for literally hours on their phoneline. You cannot order the caterpillars online and the fax number comes back as invalid. They do not answer emails. DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT THE CATERPILLARS ANYTIME SOON! I will never order this for my classroom again. School is going to be over before they even get here, let alone get through the lifecycle. I am giving it all one stars, I am sure it is fun, educational and sturdy but it doesn't help much if you don't have the butterflies."
3,3.00 processing fee?!,I bought for my grandson's birthday and was very disappointed find the certificate required another 15.00 to be sent in! I understood the cost of the larvae would be covered. I have done this project with students and it is a wonderful experience but I think this particular kit is misleading.
3,Don't know if this comapny is still in business..,I have been trying to get ahold of this company to redeem my butterfly certificates for a week. No one answers the phone and the website is down. Are they out of business? I would warn anyone who's thinking of buying this to make sure they are not just buying an empty kit.
1,Live butterfly garden,"I got this for my son's 5th birthday. He is very excited about getting the larvae to start his garden. However, I don't know how to break it to him that the larvae aren't coming because the company doesn't ship them to Hawaii. I found this out a bit late. First I tried to register online but the site won't let you. So I tried to call and fax but the lines are eternally busy. Then I sent the application. A week later I got it back with a rude note that they said...""Hawaii???"" ""We don't ship to Hawaii"". Amazon says they don't ship to APO or FPO addresses but no mention is made about Hawaii. I thought the company could have at least offered a coupon or credit in the value of the larvae or even a suggestion as to a way that I could get larvae here. The container itself is well made and Amazon shipped quickly as always. I love Amazon. The educational value? Let downs are a part of life???"
1,Don't order this if you live in Alaska or Hawaii,"After ordering this product for a birthday present, I was very disappointed to find out that the larvae cannot be shipped outside the Continental United States. This information should be clearly stated in the product description."
3,They loved it! But it's a one time thing.,"We ordered this for my nephew's 5th birthday. He and his 8 year old sister loved it! The caterpillars arrived fairly promptly (though require a $5 fee...shouldn't that be included in the original price?). They learned a lot and had a blast.The problem, is that it's a one time thing. If you want to order any more caterpillars (Certificate for Live Butterfly Garden), it will cost you MORE than the original kit (but at least they don't charge you $5 fee). So, they'll enjoy it for a week or so, but then it's essentially a throw away product."
1,Still no butterfly's,It's been 6 weeks since I placed my order for the larvae and still nothing... Horrible customer service. My 5 year old is really disappointed that he cannot use his birthday present he was totally excited about initially.
2,They will not ship the larvae if it's too hot or too cold,"I gave this to my 6 year old for her birthday in June and she is all excited to get the larvae and watch them grow into butterflies. Unfortunately, I found out when I tried to order the larvae online that they will not ship to my state (Texas) because it's too hot. Well it's hot here from May to October. So now I have to wait until probably September before I can order them. And I have to be the one to check back periodically to find out when they deem it not hot enough to ship. Only in the fine print does their website say anything about temperatures being an issue. If I had known this upfront, I wouldn't have given this to her for her birthday as she is going to be very disappointed."
4,Great Birthday Present,Gave this as a birthday present twice now and each time it was a huge hit; once to a 4 yr old and once to a 5 yr old. Would do it again - it sparks an interest in science and nature.
5,Insect Lore- great product and customer service,"This was a gift for my son and he just loved it. What was really great was that the whole family could enjoy the butterflies (even the cat, though maybe not in the same way). The net is durable and you can rig it to hang if you want but we left it on the table. The woman who gave it to him as a gift ordered the caterpillars also and she was able to specify the date they were to arrive. They came on time but they already were forming into their crysalis so by the time he opened his gift, they were already hanging upside down. It was July and a particularly hot time and when I called the company they explained that the process can be faster in the heat. But, they said without hesitation, they would send out a coupon for FREE (no shipping costs, either) caterpillars so that we can order them again once the weather cooled down. Within the week we had the voucher! They valued our experience and I will remember that in future purchases."
5,Great Product - this is my second one,I bought this 3 or 4 years ago for my son. Sent away for the caterpillars and had two delighted kids watching the whole process happen. Each summer this has also been our lightening bug container each night in June and July. We've caught local caterpillars and had varying degrees of success having them turn to butterflies or moths.My son's preschool and kindergarten class have also borrowed it for a month at a time when they were doing butterfly projects.So it wore out. Hence we are happily buying another one and will start over with sending away for caterpillars this spring and I'm sure it will house many more creepy crawlies to come.It is easy to store (folds down and velcro holds together). The zipper is easy to use (both my son and daughter could manage it at 3 1/2. It is way more humane than the plastic bug holders with a magnifying glass because air circulates and temperature is less likely to get hot.We highly recommend.
4,Great fun for the family,"This is a great product that shows little ones the life cycle of a butterfly. I have had a little problem redeeming the butterfly certificate. The phones are always busy and the website ordering is ""unavaiable"". I have finally just mailed it in."
5,Great fun!,This was a great way for the kids to learn while having fun. The size is perfect for young ages.
2,Not for me,"If you are a Baptist, and a male - or if you are in any call system - you may resonate with this author's clearly articulated pain. If you are in an appointive system where people can't vote you out, well, it doesn't help much.I wish the author had gotten past the tremenous pain he suffered befor he wrote the book. It seems cathartic for the writer, but not practically helpful to the reader."
3,Great for small messes on the floor,"We have two long haired dogs and this does well for vacuuming the hair that collects in corners (on hard floors). It does well on dry messes too (sand, coffee, soil, etc). It's handy for vacuuming the car as well. It will get the majority of the mess off the carpet, but it does not get down into the fibers of the carpet so you are better off using a normal vacuum for that. Also, it does not get dog hair out of carpeted stairs."
1,You get what you pay for...,I'm sorry people... I know we all search for a deal. THIS IS NOT A DEAL. This is a piece of horse$h1t! Spend some more change and get a better unit. I need to return it after 3 months...
3,Good Vac But Poor Battery Life,Good quality for the low price. Served our household well for probably about two years but then the rechargeable battery stopped taking a charge. I would have liked to just replace it but it does not appear that replacement batteries are sold for this unit which is unfortunate. Because of this fact I will not likely buy this model again and switch to something that has a replaceable battery pack and is a little bit more powerful.
1,not satisfied at all!!!,the worst product ever!!! i tried to vacuum my car twice and it didnt work at all. now i know why it was on such a huge sale!!! i do not reccommend it at all.
2,Works for awhile.. then dies.,"This unit works fine when it's new. But we didn't even have it a year before the battery wouldn't hold a charge anymore. We could only get a minute or so before the battery would die! Very frustrating. Then when I went to try to replace the battery I found out that you can't! You are supposed to throw it away and buy a new one! That sucks.The next one I buy, I am going to be sure I can replace the batteries when they die."
3,happy customer,"This product was shipped quickly. It was easy to assemble and worked great the frist time we used it( NOTE:it could use more power, but we knew what we were buying) so for our purposes, it worked to our satisfaction. Couldn't complain about the price either. We would definately buy more products in the future from this seller.:)"
1,Cant get parts or support,"This product has now a dead battery. It cant work & black & decker are no help at all. They just say battery in unavail. SORRY ,So I guess that means ""Screw You ,Your out of luck "" Very Disapointed I just learned that B & D is offering a Replacement Unit. It is to be sent shortly Well see"
4,Dorothy Smarz,I love this product! It is so light and easy to use. I recharge it after eachuse so I can just pick it up when needed and use. Easy to store too because itdoes not take up too much room. I have no problem with this product andthink others should give it a try.
4,small n smart,"this cordless hand vaccum is very helpful for those who have small kids in there home coz kids always making mess n this handi vaccum quickly picks up all the mess, its easy 2 clean n easily hang on wall too. thnx amazon."
3,Too Week,"It didn't cost much, but it didn't have much suction power. I guess there are no real bargains.When will I learn?"
4,It works well,"I just recently bought this dustbuster and I have to say I like it and it does the job. I was expecting the brush to be a bit larger for some reason but it works just fine for small pick ups. I bought it for kitty litter clean up as well as small dust bunnies when I don't want to bring out my full size vacuum. The only thing I don't like is that it can blow dust around while you're trying to pick it up. The power is also good. All in all, for the money, and the Black & Decker name, I am happy with it!"
2,One year life expectancy?,We have had this vacuum for a year and it has already pooped out on us :/ Battery can charge two days straight and still only last four minutes
1,really disappointed,"I bought this little dustbuster after years and years of hearing how great the dustbuster is, but I have found that it is soooo not great. I charged it maybe 10 times over the course of 2 years and the battery is DEAD! Really? 10 charges and nothing? So disappointed."
2,Very short lifespan,"I've had this cute little DustBuster for about 9 months, and must echo the woes of everyone else about the battery life. I BARELY used mine (i.e. a couple times a month), and when I did, it was for no more than 2-3 minutes. Now, even when it's plugged in it only lasts a couple seconds -- and then it won't turn off! (I even unplugged it and took it apart, but the motor kept running.) I enjoyed it in the beginning but it gradually stopped working...so I'm here shopping for a different one."
2,works about 5 minutes tops,"i dont like this one, before i had the dirt devil extreme power hand vac with 15.6volts. it died and i chose this cheaper hand vac to replace it, but i would not choose it again nor over the DDE 15.6v.the B&D; is compact which i do like. it is quietish. it is easy to unplug the charger cable.cons: doesnt pick up sesame street crackers, kix cereal, or objects of that size. the voltage is really low. not something you'd use to vaccuum your car. doesn't carry charge very long. awkward parts keep falling out.i had to sweep my entire floor surface into a pile, and even the vac ran out of juice before i finished vaccing up the pile. definitely dont recommend a vac with this low power.i dont understand the reviews where people say they vaccuumed phenomenally with this, and the real only good thing i could say about it is its charging cable is nice and simple and small."
4,Nice little vacuum,"This vacuum is very easy to use, it has pretty strong suction and it's easy to empty and clean the filter. Works great for in the car"
2,Dustspreader; not buster,This thing picks up the lint you want in addition to the slightest bit of dust. It then promptly blows the dust out into the room via the poorly fitting seam where it breaks apart for cleaning.
4,So far so good,I purchased this a few months ago. It has plenty of power and seems to hold a charge well. I've been pleased with its performance.
2,"Sucks, and not in a good way","This dust-buster, like the ones before it, stinks! The battery died within two years even though I was careful to only plug it in for charging when needed (as opposed to keeping it plugged in all the time which seems to wear down the battery even faster). On top of that half of what it picks up gets blown out the sides, and if you're not careful that air will also blow around the stuff you're trying to suck up with it. How stupid! And finally, the replacement batteries cost more than throwing it away and buying a brand new unit which is not great for the environment. Way to go Black and Decker!"
5,Dust Buster,So in love with my dust buster!! I charged for the full 16hrs as recommended for first inital charging and it works great it has great suction. It doesn't have a long life but long enough to do what I need. I'm not trying to vacuum the entire house with it just small quick jobs.
3,Ok,"I got this to pick up dog hair and crumbs quickly before guests came over. It works ok, but seems to get clogged easy. I didn't expect to much from one under 20.00 and you do get what you pay for. It started to loss the suction after 9 months. Just remember to charge it a lot."
2,Don't think it's that great.,"I ordered it because of its raving reviews. I was surprised to find out that this popular vacuum only lasts like 5 minutes. It evens says on the instruction, battery lasts no more than 10 mins. Plus, it doesn't even vacuum that well!!!"
2,Not such a great buy,I got this to replace another Black &Decker hand vacuum. This was a big disappointment since it is not very powerful and recharges really slow. Has no indicator light for recharging and doesn't work so well.
3,Not Bad,"Pretty good for it's price. Only 4.8 volts though. It's good for bigger crumbs, but I wouldn't recommend it for pet hair."
4,Solid and reliable,"I buy a Black & Decker Dustbuster @ every 15 years. I use it everyday. This unit has great suction, a long battery life, and is lightweight and comfortable to use. It's perfect for cleaning up dirt on small rugs, spills in the kitchen, and vacuuming the carpet in my car."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this for the little things, and for that it works- as long as it doesn't take you more than about 3-4 minutes to clean up. The battery on this thing sucks. It takes a long time to get a full charge and a full charge means only about 4 minutes of battery usage.Save yourself the frustration and spend the extra few dollars to get a higher quality vacuum."
1,Lousy battery sends it to the landfill fast,"This nasty little unit is an environmental disaster. Do not buy it.A convenient product for the 2 years it held a charge, now it's junk. I used mine sparingly and tried to unplug the continuous charger to conserve power.This thing charges all day, which kills the battery, eats up power, and results in a dead battery in no time. Even worse, the battery is not replaceable.My replacement was a Shark brand. Works great and I think most or all of their mini vacs have batteries that are replaceable."
1,"terrible, dont waste your time","this dust buster keeps its charge for max 2 min. Ive used much stronger dirt devils and the chargelasted for ages. Dont bother with this, it will only frustrate you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!like it did me."
1,Did the job until the battery died!,"For about 2 years (with very light usage), this DustBuster worked well enough. Its not powerful, but for the price, it helped with basic clean-up of dirty carpets. After 2 years, though, it stopped charging. Now it can't last at full power (which is only 4.8 volts) for more than a few seconds. I should have just spent more money on a better quality vacuum cleaner in the first place."
2,"It sucks, figuratively...","I hate to say it, but it isn't really useful for me. It hardly even sucks up crumbs from my couch. :("
4,"Very good, but could be dual voltage","Very good, works very well, nice to leave in the car and clean small dirty, such as dust, leafes, rocks and food. I just don't understand why the charger is not 110 ~ 220 V..."
2,"Fully charged, won't last 15 minutes!!!","So far i used it only once, fully charged, unfortunately it can't even last 15 minutes, won't use it any more."
3,"Product is fine, packaging was atrocious","The product arrived quickly and is in good condition. The fact that it is in good condition is something of a miracle, since it looked like it was packed by a blindfolded four-year-old with one hand. It arrived in a box which had been cobbled together Frankenstein-style out of three hacked up cardboard boxes. The tape was barely holding it closed. The inner packaging (the actual branded box that contained the dustbuster) was severely dented, and I am questioning whether it was actually new because it was in such poor shape. Given how shabby the box was and how poorly this thing was prepared for shipping, I'm extremely surprised that it is in good working order. Not the kind of quality I expect from Amazon sellers."
2,Works for a short time - poor battery charge,"It works great when it's charged, but keeping a charge is difficult. I experienced the same as a previous review - even with a full charge it drains very quickly when being used - no more than 5 minutes."
1,Never got a cord.,"I emailed the service company. They said they would look into it, but never got back to me.I'm still annoyed about the whole thing.I would like a replacement.Ma"
1,The main character had no depth and was very unlikeable!,"By reading the book jacket and the cute title, I thought this would be a fun, summer read. I was especially excited that the story took place in Ohio. Well, much to my horror, the whole book poked fun at Ohio and all who choose to call this state their home. Was the author from Ohio, or did she just pick a spot on the map? The story was uninteresting and the main character shallow. I work in a library in OHIO and I won't be recommending this book to any of my patrons."
2,"In a crowded field, this just wasn't a standout","I really wanted to like this but when compared to recent books like GIRLS GUIDE TO HUNTING AND FISHING, CUPID AND DIANA, and those of Elinor Lipman, this just wasn't in the same league. The humor was a little too broad and the characters a little too flat."
2,Jane Austen has nothing to worry about,"This book was extremely disappointing. I should have been tipped off by the subtitle, ""A Romantic Comedy."" That's what you call a movie, not a book. You can almost hear the author thinking, ""OK, Julia Roberts can play the lead..."" Although Austen's name and quotations from her books are sprinkled freely throughout The Accidental Bride, there is nothing Austenesque about this novel. The characters are unlikeable and unrealistic. Their actions make no sense. The prose is dull and the book is riddled with typographic errors. If you want a funny, well-written book to read on vacation, get ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and its sequel."
1,Insufferably smug,"I find it amazing that this book got published, and shocking that it got fairly good reviews. It combines a wooden, schematic plot with a smug, self-centered, unlikeable heroine. The scary thing is that the author seems to regard the heroine as a shining example of modern womanhood. I found my level of irritation rising to outright anger by the time I got to the utterly predictable , yet completely ridiculous, ending."
2,"I finished this book, but...","I have no idea why I finished this book when I have so many others waiting to be read!This book is so lightweight that even hours after reading it, I can hardly recall much about it except that I did not like it. I do remember thinking how lightweight and sterotypical the characters were and how much I disliked Lily, the ""Accidental Bride"". She was a total wimp!There were no shades of gray in this book, just stark black and white contrasts between the inhabitants and lives of those in (barely disguised) Cleveland and those in New York City. The author's antipathy for Cleveland and its (in her words) provincialism made reading this book very difficult--- and I have no love for that city.The best part of this book was the short parody that Lily wrote called ""Martha Stewart Dead"".All in all, forgettable."
1,Utterly disposable fluff,"What's scary is that the author of this silly book is actually the vice president of The National Book Critic's Circle, according to her bio. Though she tries to give herself credibility by quoting Jane Austen and referencing Proust, the fact is that this tiny, mindlessly bubbly book is sub-level Ally McBeal. Worse than watching TV--totally charmless."
1,Don't bother,"I checked this book out from the library and am sorry I wasted time reading it. Ugh. Besides the main character being a whiner, the dialogue is jerky, and the ending is ridiculous. Not to mention how offended Ohioans must be. And living in New York can't be that great all the time. Save your money."
2,Just okay,"Parts of this book were cute, but for the most part, I could not help but think that her fiance was too good for her. Nothing to write home about."
1,A Miss,"A few parts of this book are actually quite funny, in a laugh aloud sort of way as well as in a more subtle manner. However, I found the main character (amoung others) to be incredibly unlikable. Lily is completely unconnected to any one person in her life - a self-absorbed individual without the courage or strength to voice or act on her own opinions. However, her failure to be a driving force in her own life has no consequences in this novel. Needless to say, I don't think this was the impression Harayda was going for. Perhaps the challenge of attempting to present a woman who can both question the appropriateness of her impending marriage, while still relating to and with others didn't work for Harayda's sense of humorous satire and wit. I think it could have been done. I found this work to be terribly unfeminist in its failure to question assumptions and to examine relationships. A great setup, but poorly executed."
4,Loved It!,I was looking for an escape from the dreary winter days around here and this was the perfect thing. I snickered or downright laughed all the way through to the surprise ending. It kept me guessing all the way. This is a great book if you are in the mood for a little fun.
4,Great way to end the day!,Not since Bridgit Jone's Diary have I laughed like this! I loved this book - I found myself excited to crawl into bed at the end of the day and read. It let me drift off into another place and leave the stress of my day behind - the definition of a succesful book! Especially great if you are a Jane Austin fan.
2,did the writer ever live in New York?,"This is a truly bizarre book. The main character longs for New York, and constantly compares her suburb of Ohio to Manhattan--and, of course, Ohio always comes up short. But the main character's experience of New York is so cliched, so touristy, that I found myself wondering if the writer had ever lived in the city, or had just read the New Yorker cover to cover, every week, for years. The plot, well, disconnected at best. This book gives a bad name to both Ohio and New York."
3,"If you want Jane Austen, read Jane Austen","I picked up this book because of the references to Jane Austen-I thought it would be filled with the subtleties and complex characters of the great one herself. Boy, was I disappointed. Other than Lily, the characters are stock. (Although her parents did remind me somewhat of Mr. & Mrs. Bennett). I found the writing frightfully poor at points. I also found the constant idolatry of NY a bit grating. I have been to NY, and I didn't find the people at all superior to those of Cleveland, or any other city for that matter. Overall? A pleasant afternoon read, but if you're looking for true romance, strong characters, and an all around entertaining read, read Jane Austen instead."
1,Jane Austen would be shocked at the comparison.,"Did the author ever read Jane Austen? I find it in poor taste to even use Jane Austen in the book-Jane Austen found English society humorous, not a certain location. If the author wanted to make fun of a specific location, she should at least be bold enough to name Shaker Heights, Ohio (Colony Heights was founded by a Shaker Colony). Many people have made fun of Cleveland as an easy joke, but it shows immaturity and a lack of creativity."
2,Have to Agree with Previous Review,"I am a happy Bosch tool owner. Most of my power tool purchases have been Bosch as I replace my aging Craftsman tools. I have been very pleased with all of my Bosch tools so went looking for Bosch bits when I shopped for a new drill bit set. I have no issues with bent bits but stay busy ordering replacement bits for the ones that break. I know drill bits break and I have broken my share over the years, but have never experienced anything like this. I use my bits mostly with wood and hardwood and have been averaging two or three uses per bit on the smaller ones before they snap."
4,Fan of Agatha Christie,"It is a delight to have these in our small growing library and any fan of Agatha will feel the same. David Suchet is incomparable.These are little gems, every one and we look forward to adding to our collection."
1,POIROT-Classic Crimes Collection,"If you are an Agatha Christie fan, don't buy this collection. I watched (suffered through) 3 of the DVD's. They have changed the endings of the stories and have made muddled messes of the plots.I gave my brand new collection away.Read the books."
3,What you see is NOT what you get!,"Did you read in the product details that this DVD includes closed-captions? Well, you're being deceived - A&E;'s Poirot Crime Collection, as most A&E; and THC dvd collections, does NOT have closed-captions. And this is a BIG flaw not only for the hearing impaired but also for both teachers and students of English. And you are not used to the British accent, you're also going to have some difficulty to follow the dialogs!Shame on both A&E; and THC!"
3,Poirot-Classic Crimes Collection,"I have been a big fan of David Suchet and all the actors of the BBC Poirot series. This collection does not live up to the superior standards of the earlier ones. A small complaint is the amatuerish acting. But a bigger complaint is that I can barely understand the dialogue. The actors mumble and slur. And there's no Closed Captioning! How can these be produced without Closed Captioning? In spite of all this I give these films three stars, primarily for the presence of David Suchet, and for the fine detailed sets and locations."
1,Disappointing,"Episodes in this Poirot collection have been unnecessarily padded, to the extent that they become both boring and baffling, and it is difficult to follow the plot. Intrigued by The Mystery of the Blue Train, I purchased the Kindle edition of the book. The print version is better. It makes more sense. Even if you do not know who did it, it is easier to follow the plot. And the plot itself is more intriguing. Many liberties taken in the adaptation conspire to make it an unsuccessful one. The same applies to the remaining episodes in the collection. Good photography, though. And Poirot, unaccompanied by Captain Hastings or Inspector Japp, his usual foils, loses some of his charm."
3,And the Hercule Poirot series bite the dust!,"David Suchet does a great job, as always. But without his support actors, and the faulty way that A&E handles the recordings; it is time to say ""Good-Bye Poirot."""
1,The Mystery of the Blue Train,"I only saw The Mystery of the Blue Train of this set and if the others are anything like it, I don't think I'd be interested. This film does not meet up in visual standards to or have the story coherence of the regular TV series. The fades between scenes were amateurish, the editing disjointed and I wanted to fire the cinematographer. I do not subscribe to the trendy technique of excessive closeups and being unable to situate the characters in a scene or in relation to each other. If you like looking at a parade of cut-off heads, you will love this film."
2,False advertisement of this DVD,"The DVD was labeled as starring Captain Hastings, Chief Inspector Japp, and Miss Lemon. They were nowhere in this DVD and I was disappointed and annoyed not to find Hugh Fraser, Philip Jackson and Pauline Moran in this film. Whoever is responsible for this mistake should be notified. The Classic Crimes Collection is OK, but Poirot without the characters mentioned before is just not up to the same standard."
4,"Excellente, comme toujours!","As always, David Suchet is excellent. The movies are well-done. I miss Jap and Hastings, but I'll get over it. One complaint is that there are unnecessary plot changes in several of the movies."
2,has lost Poirot lost his little grey cells?!,"I am very disappointed in these new movies of Poirot. I am a great fan of these mysteries as they first appeared, with the interest being placed not on the dramatics but on good acting and a more subtle sense of humor. That is no more. The characters are over dramatized and even Poirot reacts emotionally at times, as though he had lost his little grey cells. And the camera work in The Mystery of the Blue Train made it difficult to even focus on the screen. I miss the more refined and fun Poirot of old, and probably will regretfully not buy more of these more recent versions."
4,Great Poirot - but with edited audio,"These are a great addition to any Poirot fan's collection. However, A&E released these DVDs with the edited audio for TV soundtrack so all the curse words are silenced. This is especially noticeable in ""The Mystery of the Blue Train"". Overall a little annoying but it doesn't spoil the great stories."
5,classic poirot,This is a wonderful set and puts the little gray cells to work. David suchet is poirot. Sets and costumes are perfection.
5,Clasic crime solver,The BBC series of Poirot is superb and a must have for clasical mystry movie fans. (I am a fan of all movie and TV protrayals of Ms. Christie`s works.)
4,Lost something but still fun to watch,"I agree that these are just not the same as the old Poirot movies. I miss his humor. But I still have to say that I always like to watch Suchet as Poirot, it is always enjoyable and I won't give up an opportunity to have a few more to watch."
4,sharp and witty,THIS IS A SERIES OF STORIES BASED ON AGATHA CHRISTIE'SDETECTIVE HERCULE POIROT. I SAY BASED ON BECAUSE SOMESERIOUS CHANGES TOOK PLACE. THE CHARACTER OF THE DETECTIVEIS MARVELOUS. I LIKED THEM ALL EXCEPT CARDS ON THE TABLE.THE DIRECTOR AND THE WRITERS HAVE TAKEN LIBERTIES TO ADDTHEIR OWN VIEWPOINTS ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE NOTHINGTO DO WITH THE MAIN PLOT. THESE VIEWPOINTS ARE NOT FOR EVERYONEAND THEY WERE NOT SEEN IN THE BOOKS. IT'S A REAL SHAME TO RUINSTORIES THAT WERE VERY POPULAR FOR MANY YEARS.
3,Disappointing but beautiful,"I am completely dumbfounded by the way these movies are edited. I actually was quite sure I was watching ""abridged"" editions of much longer and probably more satisfying movies. But from what I have read here these are the complete product. I think the editing is very poor, jumping from scene to scene and often back to the same actors in a completely different setting so you are left to wonder - same day? However, they are beautifully filmed. The atmosphere is wonderful, the tone and feeling, sets etc are as always very well done. I do miss Poirot's cohorts. I loved the actors and their on screen personalities."
1,"Who ruined Poirot, a real mystery","I was anxious to view these episodes as I love the traditional Hercule Poirot series. I found myself VERY disappointed that the old Poirot character and story dramatization style was gone. The new version is chaotic and nothing but emotional bedlam. I found The new production style featuring extreme closeups distracting and overly sensational. Seemingly every character in these stories is out of control. Trying to follow these stories gave me a headache. I miss the old introspective, rational, calculating character that is Hercule Poirot."
3,"Still fun to watch, but lower quality than earlier ones","As you would expect, when novels by an author are being considered for dramatization the best ones are selected first. As the number being dramatized increases the novels left to chose from are less adaptable to dramatization or are not as well written or have plot defects.This is what has happened with Poirot. After many dozen dramatizations the bottom of the barrel is being scraped for material. Another problem with these is that the characters, even though wealthy, are portrayed as culturally lower class.That said, the technical details of the dramatizations are very good. The period costumes are correct, the casting makes the characters believable.One disappointment is that Poirot is on his own and his three sidekicks from other episodes, like Captain Hastings, are not in the program."
5,christmas gift,I bought this because I enjoyed the series when it first debuted. I gave it to my mother and will watch it after she does. I am waiting for her review of it. David Suchet's Poirot is stunning!
5,DVD,"Another excellent Poiret DVD. Part of my extensive collection. Watched it a few times already. Buy it, you love it."
5,Poirot Classic Crime Collection,"This is the greatest crime collection available, Poirot is the best, especially with Hugh Frasier, as Capt. Hastings. Good mystery with just the right amount of humor. David Suchet as Poirot could not be better. Have the entire series, wish there were more. My wife enjoys it as much as I do.Don"
5,If you can do everything on this DVD you have a full performance,This is so cool to watch all the way through -- the lessons are broken up by performances. The DVD definitely warns you when a trick is likely to hit you in the head or face. It makes you obsessed with practicing.
3,Functional,"This mat is great to keep the pet food mess down to a minimum, while being easy to clean. Functionally it is perfect. The giant manufacturer's sticker right in the center of the mat is annoying, because it didn't peel right off. I have no intention of wasting a lot of time trying to scrape/scrub/peel a sticker off of a pet food mat, and I don't think I should."
4,Pet food mat,My little guy eats like a little piggy so this helps contain the flying kibble and I can clean the mat instead of the floor.
2,A Film students first time...,"I apologize in that I bought this based on a mass emailing from the Witchvox, and I wasted $10 plus shipping. It was a lovely little narrative on a few paganesque people, filmed almost as a Film Students first docu-type assignment, and nothing more. I had hoped that it would be a little more informative, or possibly something that I could or would show my Outer Court or lend to Mundanes to show them something safe and .... well... it's not. I gave it away. Arwythur"
4,Very Informative,I really enjoyed this! Gave me some really good information on an alternative religion. I wish I would have watched it sooner as I have a few Wiccan friends.
1,Dangerous to own,"Once the weapon was in the holster, was near impossible to remove it from said holster due to some obvious design flaws. I created a short video demonstrating this and sent to manufacturer. I issued an immediate claim/return and bought a Comp-Tab Belt Holster [...]Here is the video. This product is a liability[...]"
1,Not as advertised,"I received the holster, however it was not the paddle holster that was advertised. Instead I received a holster with belt loops. I would not order this its, or use the supplier again."
2,Regurgitated...,"This sequel to ""Goodbye Norma Jean"" regurgitates several scenes from that film in flashbacks, featuring ditz Misty Rowe as a young Norma Jean Baker. ""Goodnight, Sweet Marilyn"" has a very puffy & bloated Paula Lane taking over as tortured Marilyn. Unintentional laughter will take hold of you when she ""sings"" Happy Birthday Mr. President in a dress that looks nothing like the actual gown M.M. wore that evening. At least they are consistent with noticible inconsistancies because they couldn't even get Norma Jean's hair color right in the first film either. Poor Phyllis Coates (Lois Lane in the black & white episodes of ""Superman"") got plucked out of obscurity to play a cameo as Marilyn's nut-job mother in a hallucination scene."
1,Motor broke,"I had this piece in my collection for years when I finally was able to display it. It worked great through most of the holiday season last year, then the motor just quit working. You can't even take it apart to see if it is something like a loose wire. It is in the pile with all the other cute things that don't work. I might get 50 cents for it at a yard sale."
2,Not as described.,"Before ordering this leash I specifically checked the description to make sure that this leash was stitched at the ends.The description stated that it was indeed ""securely stitched"" which is false. It is a welded only leash. I'm not happywith this purchase. One should be able to rely on the description written."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"Strange Kiss is indeed a bit strange, in almost a Lovecraft sort of way. William Gravel is a SAS hard man, but that is not all. He is some sort of magic user as well, or as he calls himself, a combat magician. Not your average job.He is marking time, having annoyed one boss too many, and trying mostly to stay alive. When a friend gets sick, he investigates and finds some truly horrific, disturbing, and alien that he must try and eradicate.Not for the squeamish or prudish is this series."
5,This book made me laugh and cry!!,"What can I say? I am a mother of three young children and have a wonderful, crazy and sometimes difficult life. Beth Teitell captures it all perfectly. ""From Here to Maternity"" had me laughing out loud. Her honesty, sentimentality and sense of humor about the joys and pitfalls of motherhood makes this book a must-have for all new moms and even seasoned veterans nostalgic for the old days. I highly recommend it to all parents."
1,Waste of time and money!,"I bought this book after hearing a radio interview with Beth Teitell. The time and money spent on looking, paying and shipping the book were a waste. The only stories that I could relate to werethe swimming lesson where she didn't know the nursery rhyme and improvised and singing the Brady Bunch theme song, because she couldn't remember any others. The rest of the book (and I admit I only got half-way through before I tossed it) was horrifying.Getting mad at your children for turning OFF the television? Telling your in-laws not to let your children nap, so that you have quiet time when you get them back?Hiding the fact that it's Halloween?Seriously, what kind of a person does this? And her husband is a pediatrician.If you are as selfish as the author, you shouldn't have children in the first place!"
2,Please don't buy this for first time parents,"Witty and funny, yes....but also just more trite trash about how inconvenient kids are and how to minimize any effect they might have on your life. I especially hate how she writes in a conspirational tone, like we're all doing these awful things and she's the one actually admitting to it, like denying your kids naps til its convenient for you, throwing them at sick grandparents or whomever so you can go shoe shopping, and feeding them fast food to shut them up. I'm not so sure she even likes her kids after reading this, and I don't recommend it for a new parent. Give a newbie something encouraging and positive, not this."
5,Not my first Panasonic drill,"I bought a 9.6 volt Panasonic drill approximately 15 years ago. I have replaced the batteries twice and continue to use it. This drill appears to be of the same excellent quality. It has a nice small form and can get into tight spaces. It has excellent power and speed ranges. The chuck locks in place when stopped, which allows it to be used as manual screwdriver and also allows one-handed operations of the chuck."
4,Love this drill.,"This is my second Panasonic 12 volt. I still have my first which I used daily in my cabinet shop. It is now 13 years old and still works well. That is why I bought Panasonic again. It is light weight and perfect for shop use. The batteries stand up reasonably well. If you are looking for something for heavy duty work you may want to consider an 18 volt.The thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is Panasonic's service. The charger gave out within 3 months. No big deal, it was still under warranty. It took forever to find a repair center to service it under warranty. Two local shops were listed as Panasonic repair centers but would not warranty it because I didn't buy it from them. Finally, after the fourth call to Panasonic they had me send it to Virginia. I'm in North Carolina.I love the drill and will stay with Panasonic, just not pleased with the service."
2,"Great drill, but batteries are crap",The title really says it all. The drill has great feel and balance but the batteries started going bad within less than a year of moderate use. Replacement cost for the batteries would have been considerably more than the cost of the entire kit. Buy something with quality batteries or you'll end up sorry down the road.
5,Good product,"This is a nice drill. I replaced a Skil Top-Gun that I had used for 16 years. I like the small size, it is easy to get into small spaces. The Ni-cad batteries work just fine. Has plenty of power to drive screws."
1,Pagemaker Upgrade For Mac OSX Not Explained Clearly Enough,Sounded like just the ticket. A new iMac with OSX run by an intlel chip that needed an upgrade to run Pagemaker. Only problem it doesn't run on new iMac. Not clearly explained before purchase.
2,Not really an Atlas,"I would like to second the comments of Jacques P. Talbot. I bought this book expecting an atlas, that is a book of maps. There are some maps in this book, but they are small and cluttered and I don't really find them useful. The book is mostly pictures and text. It reminds me of that Time-Life series, that is aimed at young people, although this book is not as good as any in that series. The publishers must have changed their mind about what they wanted to do with this book. They should not have put the word ""Atlas"" on this confused mess. It might be OK as an introduction for people about 14-16 years old, but if you want an atlas with useful maps in it, don't buy this."
3,Not Quite An Atlas...,"Perhaps it should be called, ""Penguin's Lavishly Illustrated but Brief History of Ancient Rome With a Bunch of Maps."" As some reviewers have mentioned, it's really too small -- both in map quantity and size -- to earn the name of an atlas.Despite that, and the errors mentioned above, there is a lot of info in this book that can be useful -- and some of it is hard to find in other places. The map of sailing times across the Mediterranean, for example, presents information I've only found in Lionel Casson's excellent books -- and presents it in a form much easier to use.As others have mentioned, the pictures are nice, and the captions are informative. While it falls somewhat short of an atlas, I use it as a quick supplement to other references -- but now I'll be careful to verify what I find here.What I'm really looking for is a book of large-scale maps of the city and environs of Rome itself from say, 400 BC to 400 AD -- now that would be useful!"
3,Decent Introduction,"A quick and reasonable overview of Roman history. This short book provides the basic narrative, historical geography, and some highlighting of specific topics like art, funerary customs, and religions. A good introduction for high school students or early undergrads with little prior knowledge of classical history."
5,Starting point.,This short book is an excellent introduction to Roman history. It is divided into easy to digest chapters which deal with a single theme.
1,TOO MANY MISLEADING TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS,"WHY IS AMAZON RECOMMENDING THE PENGUIN HISTORICAL ATLAS OF ANCIENT ROME?? (APPARENTLY SOLELY TO MAKE MONEY!) IT IS FULL OF SERIOUS TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS SUCH AS DATES OF WARS AND BATTLES AS WELL AS FAMOUS GEOGRAPHICAL PLACE NAMES. I HAVE BROUGHT THESE ERRORS TO THE PUBLISHER'S ATTENTION SO MANY TIMES, BUT NO CORRECTED EDITION HAS YET TO APPEAR. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS ATLAS TO MY STUDENTS."
1,Missed Delivery a common problem,I was subscribed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. I enjoyed reading the delivery when it came out. The problem is that at least one or two days a week Amazon has a problem with the wireless delivery and the Kindle edition is not delivered. Each time they send a note that they are working on the problem. This has occurred for many weeks now. Until Amazon-AJC get this problem resolved I would not recommend this.
1,AJC is NOT News!,"The AJC has a long history of positioning itself in the far-left realm. Evidently, they believe they can sway public opinion. Economics have proven them wrong. The majority of people just want to read the news, not the AJC's opinion of the news. Their Kindle service is very poor. I subscribed for three weeks and the paper was late over four hours or not delivered at all seven of those 21 days. Don't waste your money here."
2,Not much of interest in this rag,"I tried this one and found little of interest.Not many articles and too shallow.Maybe if you lived in Atlanta you might find it better.I don't recommend it, at least to those outside the Atlanta metro area."
2,the ajc is crummy.,Save your money and buy a real newspaper. This is nothing but Atlanta news mixed with some local stuff.
2,atlanta journal-constitution,being a native of atlanta I looked forward to reading this newspaper. Unfortunately over the 4 days I had the subscription twice I did not receive the paper. No good explanation provided other than it was not provide. When the problem was resolved I still did not receive the missing issues. There were also gaps of data.
1,Inconsistent Delivery Kills Value,"I am cancelling my subscription to the Kindle edition of the Atlanta Journal Constitution today. I have subscribed for six months and I am at the end of my rope. Both yesterday and today, they failed to ""deliver my paper."" Instead, I got a message saying that they are experiencing problems and the edition has been delayed. It never came yesterday. If the paper arrives after 9:30 AM, it will have passed my window of opportunity to read it. This has occred more than a dozen times in the past six months. I'm tired of muttering under my breath about the level of incompetence this failure to deliver represents. It's time to fire the paper boy."
4,Very good Kindle product!,A very good presentation of the AJC. Fills a big gap now that the AJC's print edition is not broadly available outside of Atlanta.
2,Consistently Late,I'm from Atlanta but working in another city for several months. I thought the idea of getting the Journal via Kindle would be good. If you can accept the late or failiure( a few times) of the delivery of the paper daily you should be good. It gives me the information about the local sports I don't received other places.
2,Less than stellar,"I have been an AJC reader for many years, even before I moved to Atlanta, so I was excited to see that it was available on Kindle and at a very good price. My experience with the Kindle edition of the AJC has not been satisfactory though. As others have pointed, non-delivery or late delivery is a common problem. This is beyond annoying since my train trip in the morning is pretty much the only time I have to read the paper. The paper has been late the last two days. Also there appears to be no compensation to the customer for missing and late delivery.Yesterday was the most troubling of all since once the paper was delivered there were several issues. Some of the headlines or section headers were over the wrong articles. The Vent was under the heading of Deaths among other errors.I hate to unsubscribe from my local paper, but I also refuse to pay for poor service."
3,"Easy to carry around, but...","As a longtime hardcopy subscriber, the idea of adding the newspaper to my Kindle (which I love!) was a good one, I thought, one less thing to carry around. Though daily delivery has been timely and consistent thus far, to my dismay THE most critical and unique daily item is missing --OBITUARIES. Egad! C'mon..."
2,"no box scores, comics and delivery issues","for the price it is about right but poor delivery is frustrating. few pics and no box score, no comics and limited vent a bummer."
1,Needs Kindle Fire Support...NOW!,"I love the AJC, but ever since I purchased my kindle fire, it is all that I carry with me, especially when I travel. Please bring compatibility to the Kindle fire, or you will lose or miss out on subscribers."
3,"Decent Paper, but....","I honestly enjoy the Journal. I live not too far from Atlanta, so it gets a lot of use from me. BUT the Kindle edition doesn't include the Sunday edition. If you subscribe via Kindle, you will not recieve a Sunday paper..."
1,Not Enough Beef,If you like guys flashing their chests and buns this is for you - other than that stay away. This is not a DVD full of hot spring break guys showing their stuff the way its advertised. There were actually a couple of guys I had to fast forward over the moment their faces appeared and no one on here really hot. It was the mediocre shows who wanted to show everything - the only thing the cute guys showed was a deflated balloon. I've gotten 3 GGW and I think that's enough. I know there is an appeal to the concept of amateur straight guys taking it off for a camera but there's got to be better done DVD's of this kind of thing out there.
3,guys gone wild: dude where's my pants,"one of the first from guys gone wild. this was when they could geta lot of college guys to work with them. not bad, but later editionsgot better"
1,What a waste of good money!,"PROS:+ None I can think ofCONS:- The suggestion is that these are wild college-age guys but more than a few appear to be well over 30!- Really not that erotic or entertainingThis was a total waste of money. If you're looking for erotic entertainment, I'd suggest to continue looking!"
5,HOT GUYS I'M TOTALLY THERE!!!!!!!!,"I think that everyone woman and gay guy should have this,because its hot guys and we get to see their chests and who knows whatelse so go out and pick yourself a copy!!!!!"
5,An entertaining and informative read.,"Along with John Toland's The Last Battle and Cornelius Ryan's The Last 100 Days, Beevor's The Fall of Berlin paints a vivid account of the last days of Hitler's Third Reich. Many of the negative reviews of the book stem from the fact that Beevor's does not sugar coat the brutal behaviour of the Soviet forces as they fought and raped their way through Germany and Berlin. Don't fall for the Soviet apologists' revisionist history- read this book and make up your own mind. The book reads like a novel- fast paced, full of information, and quite entertaining."
4,"Not ""Stalingrad' but better than most","Having read a great deal of Russian history, both pre and post Revolution, I can say Beevor is a dedicated and educated historian. Fall of Berlin doesn't quite measure up to his first monumental ""Stalingrad"", but it is an honest and heartfelt work.Compared with some of the nonsense that is on the market trying to pass for good research and discipline, Beevor's book can do nothing but add to what we have learned about the Russian incursion into Berlin, and its aftermath.Some may find it slanted or overly curious about the sexual behavior of Russian troops, but who is there to say he is wrong?"
2,A biased book,"A book well written but unfortunately highly biased justifying the russian atrocities. Certainly war is by itself an atrocity, but that do not allows an army to commit barbaric actions against women and children."
3,Mixed bag of beans,"The book does give a good picture of Nazi Germany's last grotesque death spasms e'ven though it is not anywhere near the standards of ""Stalingrad"".The best parts are the eye witness accounts, dairy notes and letter snips. I also like the way Beaver weaves many personal stories into the book along the way.The weak spot is that Beaver ended up with 300 pages in stead of editing it down to the 100 pages that would make it a job well done.Beaver relies too much on too few sources. Sterotyping is obvious. And several themes are repeated again and again; rape, rape, rape, Berliners sense of humor, Berliners sense of humor, Berliners sense of humor, Russians stealing clocks, Russians stealing clocks, Russians stealing clocks. Boring, isnt' it?You can learn quite a lot about the last great battle of a terrible war but you have to add and subtract a too much along the way to end up with a balanced picture."
4,"Entertaining, informative, meaningful","I hate the Nazis and am incredibly glad the Soviets defeated them. I admire the sacrifices the soldiers of the Red Army made. Prior to reading this book I had not understood the extent of the rapes committed by some Soviet troops.In any account such as this it is hard to follow what is happening in what town or neighborhood on what day. The book could have benefited from additional maps.It is rare for me to read a book of this size in a few days, but I read this one. Anyone interested in accounts of the Nazi defeat in WW2 will enjoy this book."
3,NOT as good as Stalingrad,"I bought this book because I loved Beevor's Stalingrad account. This book was not on the same level. Beevor employs the same readable style, and tries to depict the experience of people involved in the conflict. I found the book too sympathetic with the Germans, but not to the same effect that some of the other reviewers did. What disappointed me was the lack of the same buid-up and climax that Stalingrad provided. The account does not contain much of actual the fighting, tactics and strategy. Beevor really does seem transfixed of German women being raped by Russian soldiers. I did like this book to some extant, but definitely did not live up to my expectations."
2,Sloooooooow,"I guess mine is a minority opinion, but I found this book very slow going, often just plain dull. Certainly the fault is not in the story, which is of abiding interest. But Beevor just failed to ignite in me the excitement that these events merit. Inevitably I compared it to John Toland's ""The Last 100 Days,"" which treats the same period in a much more lively way (though out of date in its research). Perhaps it's the division of my interest among too many characters, some of whom (the Russians primarily) are not portrayed very vividly. Maybe it's just too many battles and not enough human interest. But as I said, mine seems to be the minority view."
3,Not bad...but I've read better histories.,"Rather than reiterate the topic of this book, I will simply state what I didn't like about the book - it read more like an historical novel than it did as a detailed book regarding the fall of Berlin (i.e. the books written by Toland and Ryan were better). However, I found the stories of Red Army looting and raping to be quite horrendous, although I knew this took place. The stories of the Hitler youth boys taking up arms and vainly attempting to go into battle were quite sad. All in all, not a bad book but not as good as I had expected."
3,"Fine book, but not outstanding","Beevor has written probably the definitive English-language history of Stalingrad, and in this volume attempts to repeat the feat with the battle of Berlin. Curiously, he does not succeed. The book somehow drains the drama from the most incredible events. It is perhaps too well researched...was the author overwhelmed? Contrast ""The Last 100 Days"" by John Toland, which is a chaotic tapestry, confused and probably useless as a reference, but utterly enthralling as story telling.""The Fall of Berlin"" is not a bad book, it is just not a great one."
3,More of a General Campaign review than strictly battle of Berlin,"I wish the author would have provided maps of the actual battle situation in Berlin itself. Most of the story is a general coverage of the campaign to capture Berlin. By the time we get to Berlin the book is almost over. On the plus side, this book should be a must read for high school students to de-glamorize war - the author's coverage of the brutality is very straightforward and hard-hitting."
4,Tremendous parallels with the invasion of Baghdad,"If you read Beevor's book and then some news stories from Iraq it will be deja vu all over again. Weapons of Mass Destruction? The Soviets were convinced that the Germans had them and trained in gas masks. When the Red Army showed up, however, no chemical weapons could be found. Looting? They had it down to a science in 1945. Grand rhetoric from the leaders who were about to be rolled over by enemy tanks? Check."
2,detailed but dry,this book has good detail but I found it a little dry to read. I found myself flipping forward page after page to get past the boring details.
1,I hated this....trash!,"This idiotic shamelessly pro-German/Nazi account of the closing months of war in 1945 is a disgrace to historical works. In fact, Beevor is nothing but a journalist who should not dare to write a book as ridiculous as this again. The Soviet regime was evil yes...but to brand that evil on to the brave soldiers of the Red Army men who fought not for an ideology but for a motherland which they loved more than their own lives is stupid. They should be treated as the hero's they were...did you ever think that all armies rape in every war..."
4,"Amazing scope, but it is the details that you remember.",Might be Beevor's best yet; this is a historian writing with the confidence that comes with full command of his subject.
5,Capturing and Detailed,"Beevor, outdoes himself in this book. I'm personally not a huge fan of war books, but this one gives interesting insight into the wavering Nazi regime in Berlin just before the Third Reich fell. Detailed decription of the eventual collapse of the defenses, as well as Hitler's morale and the relentlessness of Goebels, the Minister of Propaganda who is loyal to the very end, by killing his young children and them himself and wife. The perspective is almost entirely from the German side with the exception of a few glances from Eisenhower and Churchill's view."
3,"Book: ""BERLIN: 1945"" by Antony Beevor","A remarkable historical accounting. I had the good fortune to be in Berlin while i was reading the book and visiting thesites Beevor describes added a dramatic dimension I've seldom experienced. With or without that compelling presence,this book is a ""must read"" for anyone who has even a passing interest in WW II and/or the common theme of any war story:mans' inhumanity to man."
3,A bit long read but still interesting,I found this book an average read. It took almost 200 hundred pages to actually get to the battle for Berlin.I also found that the constant minute description of atrocities committed by the Soviets as they advanced made for laboured reading.All in all I think that there are better and more succinct reads on the fall of Berlin out there.
5,Best Drill you will ever buy!,"After going through a couple of medium priced off the shelf drills that either locked up or were too heavy to use comfortably in a days work this one proved to go the distance! Lightweight, very quiet, easy to use, and super powerful! One year old and going strong! BEST DRILL EVER!"
4,kitty pics,great pics and great book but only downfall is not enough content of pics. just covers basics. still a good purchase
4,great application studyy,I found the book is an excellent starting point to address the application of the Gospel to the everyday challenges we face. I would not depend on the book as a sole source but the start it gives you is worth the investment
2,Late and doesn't work!,"I had received the iClick way past the estimated delivery date.The seller was generous to refund the shipping, but it was waypast my daughters birthday, and long after we returned from vacation. I have experience with MP3 players, but after many hours, I have yet to be able to get this one to work."
5,Great,"While there are many courses that teach you classical/written Tamil, there are not many courses for those interested in modern colloquial Tamil.This one is really good. If you're interested in spoken Tamil, don't waste your time, just get this course. I would also recommend A Grammar of Spoken Tamil (by H. Schifmann).This course is given in a semi-phonological transliteration (with Latin script and occasional IPA symbols).The course is not in phonetic transcription (the way people pronounce it).For example: poovoom (let's go / we'll go) is normally pronounced as [po'] and not as the transliteration may indicate.These differences between the transliteration used and the actual pronunciations (recorded in the available audio material) are not explained."
5,Saved My Skull.,"This is my 3rd ski helmet and so far the best. I originally bought this helmet for how it fit my head and and goggles (A-Frames) and was very impressed with how it preformed in the cold. It is warm and the adjustable vents do help control the airflow. For my head it is a perfect fit.Where this helmet really preforms is in protection though. I ski hard and occasionally fall hard. Recently though I took a hard spill while wearing this helmet and still got knocked out. The helmet is dented slightly, but still absorbed most of the impact. I tell you If I didn't wear a helmet I would be dead or at least a vegetable.Simply put if you want a fine piece of equipment that preforms Buy this helmet."
4,Useful reference plus very interesting information,"The book contains very interesting folklores related to Asian teas and introduced some of the author's favorites. Kam gives a brief introduction to few of the finest teas in the world, and much on the popular teas. Then an interesting tea ceremony. Although at some points I don't agree with the author, I do recommend this book to whoever interested in teas. A pleasure to read."
2,Beware misinformation!,"The Way of Tea has a very nice photographic explanation of gong fu tea preparation. Unfortunately, much of the information about tea types is misguided or just plain wrong. The author uses terms that are not in general use or are confusing, such as ""light green"" for oolong. Even worse, he seems to think that varieties such as oolong, black, white etc., are produced by different types of tea plant rather than as the result of different ways of processing. The tea history is pretty much cobbled together from other sources, though where he got the idea that Middle Edo period in Japan corresponds to the Tang Dynasty I have no idea! Buy this book for the information on gong fu and the nice illustrations and photos, but get your information on tea types and processing from ""The Story of Tea"" by Heiss and Heiss."
5,Great starter tea book.,I was very pleased the The Way of Tea. I have learned so much from the history and overview. I had the pleasure of taking a tea class from a great new spot in NYC (Radiance Tea) and it was nice to know a little going in. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know more about the art of tea drinking.
2,Hackey Sacks,"The girls loved the colors but the durability of the hackey sacks are poor. We received them by Easter and already six have ""bitten the dust"". The beads fall out easily and do not hold up long at all. My youngest hackey sack was finished within 30 minutes."
4,very good,these hacky sacks are not the best but better than average. They are filled with foam and durable. They are better than you would expect for there price but not for an experienced hacky sack player. I would recomend to be perfect them for a beginer.
1,sucks,horrible product most are shaped like eggs the rest fall apart after one use dont buy there just so sombody can buy them for 10$ and sell them for 15 to rip sombody off
2,Little less durable then we'd hoped,We received this product and my son immediately ran around playing.Super fun. But they broke quickly and he'd already broke 3 before 30 minutes justfrom regular play. We have cats so the little balls of stuffing are dangerous also.Disposable toy
4,Hacky sacks are good for juggling too,"These Hacky sacks were to be used to teach a small group of children to juggle. It appears to have succeeded! Hacky sacks are squishable and easy to catch, making them good juggling props. These are also not very expensive (around $1 a ball). Even tennis balls cost more than that these days."
5,"Beautiful Flatware, High Quality","Had these dishes for over 2 years, and they are still beautiful. I've never bent one fork or spoon even the slightest. The design is very pretty, and all the utensils have the perfect weight, feel to them. Probably the best flatware I've used in my whole life."
2,Children's Stroies,"This DVD series for children may purport to be a good way to get children interested in the Bible, but it takes too many liberties with biblical stories and is lite fluff. We tried to use it for our summer children's church material. Though it was somewhat entertaining for the kids, it did little to enhance their understanding of God or the Bible. The dvd segments are short (15-20 minutes) and need a good deal of support by people who know the Bible well and can fill in the gaps."
5,This is definitely the best guide of its kind I've seen.,"I've just spent some time driving all over the state of Wyoming. Before I went, I looked at every guide book I could find at local libraries and travel book stores. Laurence Parent's book is one of those that I chose to take with me, and I used it throughout the trip. Every chapter was filled with accurate, interesting information. Some of the best places to see in Wyoming are away from the major tourist areas and some are completely ignored by other (many larger) books that I had."
5,Froolap,Batteries arrived as advertised. They work fine in my Sanyo camcorder. Would recomend this seller.
1,"Should be called ""not last"" batteries",I purchased two of these batteries. They are nothing at all like the original batteries in length of charge. They MAYBE last 1/2 hour. I guess you get what you pay for...cheap chinese knock offs.
1,It Broke the first time I used it,"The first time I used this machine the handle broke off (a 1/2 pin completely sheared off under the rubber dampers), and I only used it on my driveway. The pull string also did not return properly, and I found it was completely underpowered. Unfortunately the customer support line was not helpful, and I ended up replacing it with a different companies model. It is just not worth the time fighting with the customer support people. Buyer beware."
1,Junk,Does not work - junked it (not expensive enough to return. Ipod Nano did not recognize it and would not charge.
2,Manufacturing defect makes otherwise nice boots very uncomfortable,"I purchased these boots online and saved $50 instead of purchasing at Nordstrom's. However, after wearing them for less than two days, one has developed an irritating crease near the start of the laces which pinches my foot every time I take a step. It's very uncomfortable. The other boot fits great. I'm disappointed in paying so much money for these boots and now they are painful. I would exchange them for a new pair if I hadn't worn them yet."
2,Sole does not last,"This will be my second pair of ECCO Men's Track II High boots. I will start out by saying that they are very comfortable and the uppers are bullet proof. The weak link is the sole. It is an injected/molded design which cannot be replaced (with same design). The outer material wears quickly, exposing the black injected foam. Once this happens, the sole will wear quickly and the boot will have to be re-soled. When I sent mine to Ecco, they charged me $75.00 and replaced the sole with a hard Vibram sole. Completely changed the characteristics of the boot....no longer a ""cushy"" ride! Contacted Ecco customer support and got noooo response. Opposite of Keen which will do anything to make their customers happy.....disappointing!"
2,Sole deteriorates,"First off, I like Ecco shoes and probably among the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. If not for the deteriorating sole, I would rate this 5-stars.I bought mine couple of years ago and wore it probably 5 times. This weekend it is cold and raining and I decided to wear it. About an hour later I noticed that my foot is not feeling right but I ignored it. After a while, I checked the shoes and the sole literally is breaking apart. A few chunks as big as 1"" x 1/2"" x 1/4"" can be seen along my trail (and I was just shopping in Costco)! I got home and checked the sole...inside it looks like a soft almost clumpy/powdery foam and once the rubbery outer shell started to break, the rest just falls apart.I am very disappointed with the quality especially for the price I paid for it. I will never recommend Ecco until they change their sole material."
3,Not the same,"I have a pair of ecco high gore tex boots purchased six or seven years ago which I really like and the quality and workmanship is second to none, the new ones are not the same, being outsourced to China was not a good thing to do to the customers who want high quality and comfort that we were used to in ECCO products.."
4,good boot!,"The ecco trackII is a very well made boot. The cut and stitch work were of fine quality. The instant I put them on they felt very comfortable. No break in time is needed, the leather is soft and flexable. I work on concrete floors in an autobody shop for ten hours or more everyday. My legs,feet and knees have felt much better at the end of the day since wearing my TrackII's for about two months. I gave them four out of five stars....for now. If they prove to be durable and stand up to my work enviroment, then they will get five stars. But for now they get four. I do plan on buying another pair just for everyday wear....they are that comfortable. Maybe i'll try TrackIV....ecco has made a new cutomer in me!"
1,FYI,"[...] This should be readily available public knowledge for anyone looking to purchase this shoe. After all, it is your hard earned money that you are shelling out to them. They make the soles in a way that they fail early on so you are tied into a repair or ""reconditioning"" fee. wrong wrong wrong. ECCO = FAIL"
5,These boots are Made for Walking,I have purchased two pair of these boots. The first pair was purchased over three years ago and they have worn (daily) very well.They are very comfortable and provide great support for my ankles and feet. I use Aetrex inserts with them and they fit perfectly. This boot is a great value for me because I have big feet and they cost less than the retail store.
3,Track II Ecco's,Good boots and always sturdy. However they are not as comfortable as other Ecco styles I have had. I recommend the Track 6 plain toe boots for comfort.
1,ecco danish for falls apart,"Echo previous negative reviews. Sole fell apart. These feel like wonderful boots, you try to take care of them- suddenly soles are crumbling beneath you as you walk. I thought it was a fluke when it happened in another pair of Eccos- now has happened twice."
5,ECCO MEN'S TRACK II MID,The boots are of very high quality. I have used as a work boot for 10 years in the automotive industry. They are extremely durable and as comfortable as a high end hiking boot.
3,Cracks after a couple years,"I used one of these on a 1990 Audi Coupe Quattro, to connect a port on the 7A throttle body to a metal vacuum line that I believe makes its way to the charcoal canister. On this application, the hose is in a hot area near the exhaust manifold. I can't say how long ago I replaced this, but it was at least one year and possibly two years ago. I found that this hose was all cracked up and leaking. I get the impression that this rubber, which is quite soft, is not as durable as the original equipment. However, I don't find many alternatives at the local auto part stores, so this may be the only option if you need one. Just keep an eye on it after a while."
5,why pay more?,"This charger is cheaper, smaller and even charges is the vehicle, why pay for the original canon charger when you can charge on the go for less."
5,Things Are Getting Intense!,"This set will cover episodes 27-39 of the rebirth of the world's greatest anime- Dragon Ball Z! On the last set, we were introduced to Freeza, Zarbon, and Dodoria. On this set we will see the arrival of Goku at planet Namek, and the Ginyu Force! FUNimation Entertainment is not holding back on these releases, as the sript is outstanding, swearing and all!I was a little disappointed that Freeza didn't get the cover for this release, but hopefully he will be on Part Four!This will make a great Christmas present, as it comes out in December!Support DBZ by buying these sets!"
2,"Tried to order, but........","I tried to get one on here when Amazon was selling this for around 12$. I waited over a month and received nothing. I eventually received an email that said it was cancelled and that they were not receiving anymore. Bummer. I watched some of season 4, pretty good looking, not perfect. There's no telling whether this version of dbz will play to the end on Blu ray. I don't like how some seasons are already discontinued, delayed, etc. Also, what's up with the other versions, 1.2, etc. They're milking it, and not makeing sure the fans can even complete their collection before coming out with other versions. Not sure what else to say, Amazon! I want this for 13$ :)"
2,"Sorry, didn't like it. Does not have a variety of styles.",I was highly disappointed in this book. I was expecting a more step-by-step format. I would not have purchased it had I seen it in person. Why is it listed #1 in the matting category? I hope that this is no indication of the books in that category to follow.
4,Slightly disappointed,"These arrived in the mail today and when I opened them up, I was slightly disappointed. They look a lot bulkier in person that they did in the picture. They're still very nice though, and definitely quality silverware."
4,Good but not perfect!,"Generally, Nintendo Power published an excellent game guide! Everything is perfect as always for a guide, the walkthrough, maps, detail locations of items, side quests, etc.The only flaw of the book are the exclusion of the Lunar Ruins section of the game. Even though bestiary did show some of the monsters in the Lunar Ruins sectin, the guide only reveal limited information about the whole floors of the masive dungeon.There's also no strategy on the tougher bossess as well as any maps to show the whole dungeon.Overall, this book is an invaluable source for those who just want to finish the 1st part of the game without continuing on to the Lunar Ruins."
2,"DIDN""T HAVE WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR","I was a big fan of Finial Fantasy 2 back on SNES. I played the game many times and know it pretty much back to front.I ordered the strategy guide for the add-on levels of The Lunar Ruins. I was hopingto find map layouts and what enemies were on what floors. Like where to find all the really rare enemies.Instead, I got one page on The Lunar Ruins, no maps of its 50+levels, and ex. - Worst Malboro can be found in the Lunar Ruins. Yea thanks for pointing out the obvious.There wasn't even that much artwork to acompany it. Just a lot of repeats. And Amano has tons of Final Fantasy art they could have put it in this guide.Really not worth the money unless you're a beginner to the game."
2,"Too predictable, not enough depth","I have to say I had high hopes for this novel. I love small town stories and characters but other than the main character, we are not given the chance to learn or really like much about the other people who change her world. The storty reads more like a made for t.v. movie. If you are looking for a good 'small town read' find a Fannie Flagg novel and enjoy."
1,What a disappointment,"Open letter to Lawana Blackwell: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. But that's what happened with Ms Blackwell's latest book, and it's a mess. Ms. Blackwell has produced an impressive body of work in the historical/romantic Christian fiction, and this is a departure. While I've found her past work compelling, interesting and complex, this latest edition (set in the current day)is -- in a word -- boring. In her past books I've found the heroines individuals that I was interested in and would root for; but for the antagonist in this book I couldn't muster an iota of sympathy or plain old interest. So my suggestion to Ms Blackwell is to return to what you know and have succeeded with. I had high hopes and great anticipation for this new read...and am very disappointed."
5,"functional, sleek, solid",This product does what it purports to do. Seems sure that it will hold up better than cheap aluminum presses I've bought in the past. Storage of the cleaning tool is a wonderful thing -- I bought this press because I lost the cleaning tool from my previous press (different brand). I trust the Hoffritz name.
4,"WORKS GREAT, BUT...","I love this garlic press! It presses garlic like nobodies business and the price is right too. I gave it 4 stars instead 5 because of it can wear out and brake quickly, especially if you use it a lot. But for it's reliability, I recommend that you buy a few of them to keep on hand, just in case."
1,Boring,"There is not much content here. There isn't much being said, if you buy this for your child I would say it is ok. If you are an adult I would not read this. It is pretty mundane and not very in depth into Adam's life or thoughts really at all."
3,adam sandler or is it?,"of corse everyone loves adam sandler,but not all the book about him are to love.adam sandler;america's comedian by bill crawford seems well 'safe'.I as well as other people want to know the true about adam and this is not the place to find it.so yes on a scale of one to five i give this book a three. Because the writing was ok (and i mean ok).we aren't little kids mr. crawford.If you what to know about adam get this book but if you what more..."
1,Education for the Right Wing,"The worst book on education I have read. Over-and-over through this book the author makes blanket statements about cooperative learning, bilingual education, whole language (I do agree with her some on this one) condemning them and stating that these can hurt students and especially at-risk students. Education is not that simple and to give exaggerated negative information about these practices is obnoxious and harmful to the thousands of educators who apply them successfully in the classroom."
4,Works as advertised,"It works, no problems. Makes the Garmin GPS not eat batteries every two days with constant use in the car. I have not tried it on a boat yet.-Pete"
4,Plug in charger,This is great so compact. Space is always a concern with all the items in my car so this retractable charger is really nice. Good job Amazon.
4,Garmin Cigarette Lighter Power Adapter,This power adapter worked perfectly with my Garmin. I was able to run the line through the dash so it stayed hidden. My install was very clean and this adapter had a lot to do with it.
4,Solid cable,"This is a very solid power cable built to last. My only complaint is that it is difficult to use with the Garmin mount (GARMIN 010-10457-00 Auto Mounting Bracket Suction Cup) due to the angle of the wire lead from the GPS connector. Otherwise, this is a very good product. The connector mates with the GPS unit solidly and stays where it belongs even when the GPS unit is getting bounced around off road or falls off the dash mount."
4,Works exactly as advertised!,...and at a cheaper price than Garmin's equivalent. I took off 1 star because I emailed the manufacturer with a question and they never replied.
4,Screwed by Amazon,"My Order was over $475. with free shipping... Then Amazon pieced mealed it out.. some items were less then $25. then I got hit up on shipping... Never again Amazon, will I use you !.Said everything was in stock... well 3 weeks later got items because it was not in stock.. What a Trick...never again... and I tell everyone I know of this trick...Frank"
4,"Works great, but not necessary.","I bought this to use with my Garmin GPSMap 60CSx. It works great, but is a little ""clunky"" with the huge adapter for the serial cable port. What I found, though, is my phone charger cord for my Motorola phone is the same adapter for the usb data cable for this device. So - I already had a power cord for this GPS. Didn't need this adapter. Either one will power the unit in the car."
4,Nikonuser1,"It works. I could drive around with this connected to the 12V output on the car and not use the batteries in my Garmin GPSmaps 60CSx. When it came, I had a really difficult time pushing the connector onto the GPS slot. It finally started to go and after I connected and disconneeted several times it fit okay."
4,comfort issues,These shoes are adorable and I love them. I can wear them with so much however the material makes them a bit uncomfortable bc they dont give at all. Make sure you buy a size up if you have wider than average feet because they can be very uncomfotable at the end of the day.
2,Comfort and Fit,"These shoes are so cute! But really uncomfortable! I had tried them on in a different color at a Nine West store and they seemed ok at the time. They fit true to size but are very stiff and wearing them isn't improving the stiffness. They are fine for sitting at a desk but are very hard to walk in for a long time.They haven't given me blisters but are actually rubbing on a bone. I plan on trying leather softener but if I could return them, I would."
5,Really works,"I've taken uva ursi a couple of times to rid myself of a uti. It takes about 5 days to completely heal, but it does work and I am much happier taking something natural than antibiotics. This product worked very well for me. I've taken uva ursi in the pill form before but I believe the drops worked better and faster."
1,confusing,A great shame that this is written in such an obfuscatory manner. Some of it makes absolutely no sense at all.
2,"good product,bad company to deal with","I sent the antenna holder back in December 2011 for credit, per Amazon's instuctions(DXV44CQCRRMA),I sent Navshere a e-mail of why I was sending back the product,and I have not heard, nor received credit from Navshere! Called Amazon and they said I should wait longer to here from Navshere. All I want is my money back.The thousands of $$$$$$ I have spent with Amazon gave me too many expectations for a time like this when I had to send something back.Jim"
5,Exactly as advertised,Simple product works exactly as advertised. Stick it to your windshield and slap on the magnetic antenna and you're good to go. Also comes with two screws if you really want to make sure the antenna doesn't move.
1,Do not order if you may have to return them,The shoes were great but I had to return them for another size. I was never informed they could only refund my payment not exchange. I followed return/exchange instructions that were placed in the box. Then Dancewear Solutions claim they never got the shoes back and Amazon refuses to refund my payment so I have been screwed out of my money. I will never order anything from amazon or dancewear solutions again.
5,Awesome TV!,"I've had it for about 2 months now and it is an Awesome TV! My only gripes are that shadows or dark areas of subjects on the screen tend to black out instead of shadow, the other is that is has a lamp instead of LED, but hey, at $999 it still earns 5 stars. Other than that the picture is AMAZING. The TV has a slim bevel which is VERY nice, color is vibrant and very sharp. The TV's light engine is not noisy at all. High def signals (from Xbox360 or satellite box) looks so incredibly crisp. The TV does not have the bowing issue I have read about.The sound from the TV is not good but I never bought it for the sound (I have a sound system)."
1,"can you say ""bow""","As soon as I received this tv, noticed a bowing problem. Had a tech come out, but he really didn't know how to fix it. Called amazon and they are going to pick it up. I am going with the hlt5087s with the led light engine. I beleive the slightly higher cost will be well worth it so I don't have to buy replacement bulbs for the 5076s."
1,Samsung DUD - NOT Recommended: Support Sucks,"We purchased this TV through Amazon for the in-laws and the in-laws have had nothing but T R O U B L E. The TV spontaneously reboots approximately once every 1.5 hours. The error code in the bottom right hand corner of the screen do not match anything in the product manual. Samsung tech support punts us to Amazon. Amazon tech support punts us to Samsung. WTF? Calls are probably routed to Samsung & Amazon of India.Tried using the online tech support feature for Samsung. There is no apparent way to input the serial number for the product information portion of their repair request form. We can't even manually submit a repair request!We are so dissatisfied with Samsung and Amazon that we are boycotting both companies. I invite anyone having issues with either company to join our boycott.Yours Truly,A Very Dissatisfied Family in Texas."
2,Would've been nice if it worked out of the box...,"We're all psyched for the new big screen; delivery day is literally like christmas morning when you were 6 and still believed in santa. Everything is set up and ready to go (bonus, the remote does come with batteries already), 15 mins into glorious HD big screen wonderfulness... the whole picture goes purple, fuzzy, and shifts to the right. What? I thought big expensive things were supposed to work coming out of the box? Apparently not. Oh, and the customer ""dis""service tells us that samsung outsources their work to a company that can't be there for another 5 days, they don't bring anything they would need so we have to wait another 2 weeks for them to come fix it. Not cool. The TV seems to be fine now, but if you're looking for something that will work brand new, I'd look elsewhere."
3,Samsung service is the pits!,"Bought this T.V. after loads of research. Love the picture, but had a significant bowing problem. Almost had to kill someone at Samsung to get something done. Their customer service is for the birds. They made their money with your purchase, so that's as far as they want to go."
2,Great service from Amazon and Eagle. Horrible product from Samsung.,"Bottom line: TV is horribly bowed. 4 different Samsung techs told me there is no cure. I sent it back. If the TV was not bowed, the picture quality would be extrordinary. Alas, it is bowed, making the overall picture quality quite poor.Amazon and Eagle made the delivery and return process easy."
4,Great TV........ Horrible shipping,I just had a horrible experience with Eagle / Ceva. The original Samsung TV that was sent to me last weekend was badly damaged. When the delivery people first arrived I saw a huge tear in the box. After they opened the box we saw that the entire screen had been bashed in so I refused delivery. Amazon was very proactive and immediately shipped a replacement TV the next day.Yesterday Ceva delivered in a new box the original damaged TV back to me...... God only knows why.... After calling Ceva and speaking to the manager they confirmed that this was a mistake and the original TV once again left my flat. Later yesterday evening my replacement finally arrived....Worse experience EVER with home delivery.....Now that the shipping mess is over and the TV is here it has a beautiful screen and the HD channels are breathtaking...
4,I love this Samsung,"I purchased this television from Best Buy. I had been on the fence for so long regarding which television to buy (DLP, LCD, Plasma...etc.) for almost three years. I figured for the value per screen inches, this DLP television was the winner. The picture quality is superb, and I don't have a bad thing to say about this television. The television sits on the stoop above the fireplace. The TV dims just a little bit, but that isn't its fault. This would have happened to any other TV that I bought. Just have a little patience when setting the TV to your preference. The owner's manual is great and provides direction on how to replace the lamp when it eventually dies. Did I mention that this TV is great? BUY THIS TV!!"
1,White dots appear after two years- ruins picture -lousy customer service,Google 'white dots' and you will see what you are in for with Samsung and their TVs.A nightmare!They will not fix or repair the tv even though they know they installed defective chips.Thousands of complaints and another class action suit lawsuit brewing in NJ. DO YOUR HOMEWORK. These things are failing after two years of use.
3,I have mixed emotions...,"I am a bit torn about this book... the illustrations are very cute, and it is an interesting well written story, but I don't know exactly how I feel about the story... it is a bit scary, and I can see how some children would have to be reassured about this story... it does have a happy ending, but I think you should evaluate your own child's emotions and personality before reading this story to them... I own it, but it won't be a first read to my children... I will wait till I determine each child's reactions to other things..."
4,Tiny is the key word,"I bought this for my 17 month old son who is a little tall for his age. I couldn't wait for him to try it out, but he just seemed too big for it. His legs were so bent, he had trouble trying to push it. Although the age specified is 1 to 3, if you have a taller child, you might want to try a bigger trike. We gave it to his 1 year old cousin and its perfect for him. I really love the trike, its just very small."
5,Radio Flyer Trike Review,"We love this little trike. It's been the perfect size for our 12-24 month olds (we've had four now)... and someone else must have thought it was perfect too, because it was taken from our front yard when we left it out. So now we're getting another one for the youngest. It's sturdy and smooth and never lets your child lose control of it. It's great."
1,A Disappointment,This is a beautifully made bike but is too small for my 18 month old grandson. His legs are too bent for him to be able to move the bike with his feet. Perhaps you should have different heights available.
5,l,I had one of these when i was small i liked it a lot and so did my sister. It lasted a long time. When we were too big for it we gave it to my neighbor.
3,if you don't mind a little rust...,"We bought one of these 6 years ago for my older son and are using it now for little brother. Honestly, though, neither were ever really THAT into it. I think the ""classic"" wood construction is really more appealing to us adults than to the little guys. It's still in pretty good shape, save one complaint...though we stored it boxed in the garage for all these years, it did come out with a light rust coating on the handlebars when we pulled it out again, even though it's NEVER been exposed to rain or anything. Probably nothing a little steel wool and elbow grease wouldn't fix though. But, un ""upgrade"" to a Little Tikes bike seems eminent -- the little guys seems to gravitate toward those more."
1,cheese pleater,"Don't know what's the matter with this plane. It's nice and sturdy. But it hardly cuts the cheese at all, just wrinkles it up into ugly pleated hunks."
5,A cheese plane....,It's a cheese plane.....it cuts cheese.....and it does it well.It's a nice product.
5,lgcu500 battery,Excellent product and very reasonable price. Will buy the same product again if needed and will recommend to friends.
5,Great quick meal planner,"I purchased this book in 1981, and I still reach for it when I am recipe searching. The recipes are delicious and interesting too. The book is divided into the 4 seasons, and sure enough, if you need a summer recipe on a hot day, you'll find it here. Also, the entire meal is planned, including desert. I thank Jean Hewitt every time I reach for her book!"
1,Great functionality but waste,"This is my first blue tooth headset. Head set looks great!! Small yet stylish, great sound quality. But the biggest problem is, it doesnt fit in your ear and the so called ear hook stays way above your ear. The multifunctional button lies on the top of the head set and I press the this button every time i try to adjust the position of the headset during a call and the call ends. This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear. Please dont buy it."
1,Defective Item,"The item arrived on time and looks like the photo. However, the bluetooth that I received was defective and did not work."
3,Bluetooth,"The product cam ein odd pckagse but shipping was way fast, Sounds quality is absolutely great and very comfortable, but the mic sucks, It hears everything int he background except you"
2,"Cheap, uncomfortable, earloop will break!!!","I have had this unit for over half a year. Sound quality is actually ok, but thats where the positive characteristics end. Only one size of earloop comes with the unit, for me it was too large, just hovering over my ear. Its very flimsy and broke off after 3 months. The earpad itself is not soft enough and prolonged wear is painful. The worst part is that the rubber earpad tends to snag on clothing and come off the unit. If you don't find it, too bad, as again the unit comes with one earpad only.I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Very Disappointing - definitely not worth the money,"We have had this baster for less than a year and the bulb has already cracked and split, rendering the thing virtually useless. My old cheap plastic baster -- which I got at the dollar store -- lasted longer than this product."
5,Baster + Rotisserie = Yummy dinner!,"My husband and I were looking for an injector to replace the cheap plastic one that came with our rotisserie. When we saw this, we decided to give it a try.This thing performs wonderfully as a flavor injector, and we have used everything from barbecue sauce to tequila into the poultry and fish we cook in our rotisserie. The two work together making the healthiest, juiciest meats you can find.If you have a rotisserie, definitely get this item.Also, having cooked many a bird in a conventional oven, I recommend this as a simple baster as well. Don't buy a plastic baster that will melt when you put it too close to the heat source. Metal is better!"
1,"The Myth of ""German Engineering"" is Long Over","Although I have no idea where this ""thing"" is actually made, the name Hoffritz made me think of BMW and Mercedes; it may, in fact, be made in China, for all I know. Nonetheless, I fell into the trap - thinking that this device was a 1st class baster. Not only did the needle detach itself inside the bird - forcing me to perform pre-Thanksgiving dinner surgery on the bird to remove it, but the bulb starts to disintegrate when it comes in contact with hot oil (the kind frequently found in roasting pans). It is PURE JUNK & DANGEROUS! Do NOT buy it. Might be usefull for feeding baby lizards, or something."
4,Best Gift Ever,"My dad had been looking for a nice stainless steal baster for the longest time. All the ones he found didn't have the accesories like this one. He loves the injector attachment as well as the scrub brush. It's the perfect gift for someone who cooks as much as our family does, especially with smoking on the grill the injector allows you to infuse the meat with flavor."
4,Great starting point,"This book is a great overview of many of the topics first time moms need to consider since the vast majority of us are working before we have our fisrt child, whether we remain in the workforce or not.Love the ""feed to wake"" section. And the childcare topic is a great resource.definitely should be read in the conception/early pregnancy stage."
5,Thank God someone figured it out.,I thought I was going to have to give the baby back! Clearly I didn't fit the mom description in any of the standard baby guides. And while I adore all the Girlfriend's Guides - Babyville actually gave me some great guidance as well as making me laugh.Hope she's writing a sequal called Toddlerville! It's a tiny town but it sure as heck needs a mayor.Lotta
4,Awsome sound!,"The superb production makes this a great 1993 tour souvenir of the Mk 2 line-up. Songs include a 12 minutes version of ""Anya"", ""Anyone's daughter"" and ""A twist in the tale""."
2,Drab and boring!,"I couldn't manage any more than forty pages of this pathetically stuffy book. I consider myself a well read person and for me to give it only two stars should be telling your it's absolutely miserable. Reading the dialogue is like watching a bad adult video - and that's pretty bad! I stumbled upon this book by typing in the word 'assassins'. I recently read both The Brotherhood of the Rose and The Covenant of the Flame, both by David Morrell and they were EXCELLENT. Those are books that make you want to take a day off from work and finish - certainly not 30 Seconds. I'm really sorry I wasted my money on this. Don't make the same mistake I did."
2,Blank Book,"I love Susan Branch and have many of her books. I thought this book would be similar, but with spaces to write in special moments. Instead, this is really a journal. It's completely blank (lined pages with a quote or small picture). No writing prompts. I was going to give this as a gift but I feel it's not appropriate unless the person is truely a Susan Branch fan."
5,Well worth the $!,Even though these segments are from film elements...this DVD is well constructed and entertaining! What a GREAT time in TELEVISION! This is when HOLLYWOOD was full of GREAT stars....real stars with Talent! Johnny was the BEST! Leno doesn't even compare to what this show like. At least this DVD will be proof of what a REAL 'TONIGHT SHOW' was like!
3,I love Johnny Carson......but,This DVD is just awful. The picture is blurry and the voices do not match the lip movement....the volume is low. It's not good.
3,"clip, clip, clip","as seems to be par for the tonight show releases, as well as others,this dvd is edited so we can see what they deem as the best stuff from a whole episode. i get tired of people deciding for me what i don't need to see. this dvd is billed as a lost episode. the implication is you will see the whole show start to finish...we get about 35 minutes. if i want clips i'll go to a barbershop."
4,"A great time, but the DVD...","This is a great DVD, a wierd look at how different television was 35 years ago. You'd never see people smoking and drinking, with the guests half soused! In all, this is lots of laffs, most of which are still great today. All in all, the material is quite fun to watch.The producer of the disc has a clear-cut case of ""Because I can,"" that is, ""I can edit the program and add stuff to make it mine, so I did."" The opening was cut and clips of Carson entering the stage from different time periods were used. Ok. The most jarring thing is the psuedo-60s overlays with the guest's names after Carson announces them. What's the matter, can't we hear?Oh well. The material is as good as it can be for a video to film to DVD transfer. Get the disc for the laughs, not becuase there was good editing judgement used in putting it together. Maybe one day we'll get a bigger release of Carson's shows, with no stupid editors attached."
3,Very elementary guide,"Nice to have in your pocket while walking the beaches, but drawings are very simplistic. It will help narrow down what you are trying to ID.It is worth the cost for the beginner birder. Not much use once you learn the birds. Final ID will be from color guides."
1,Didn't fit,The replacements were much thinner and shorter than the ones that came with the extractor. The extractor was for 5/16 and fit my application but the replacements weren't then same.
1,PLEASE!,"No self respecting actor would ever use this text! It assumes you know absolutely nothing. It attempts to put the text into a readable form, but I see nothing charming about translating Moliere into American slang or braindead sentences. Get a real translation and don't waste your time!"
4,The Northwest Passage On Ten Dollars A Day,"A book I found hard to put down once started. Interesting historical information as well as a good true story. In this day and age of high tech, three ordinary men make an extra-ordinary trip through one of the most hostile marine environments anywhere. They did it in a boat one of them built in his back yard and proved you don't have to be a millionaire to have high adventure.They did it without any icebreaker support.The story gives the reader some very good historical information that even non-boaters will find useful and not generally available.The techniques used by these three who lived together in such a tiny space for five months without so much as even an argument are amazing.Overall a jolly good read."
5,A First-Time Mother's True Helper!,"This book was given to my husband and I, along with many other books, when we announced our pregnancy. The practical suggestions and real-world advice that this book provides far outshines many of the highly publicized books that are currently so popular. When preparing to stock our nursery with the essentials needed upon arrival of our baby I literally took the book into the store and purchased my much needed items off the list entitled ""Predelivery Essentials."" It was helpful beyond words and I highly recommend new parents to obtain and actually use this book. It has made preparing for our new bundle of joy a much more focused and empowering experience than had we gone it alone. I look forward to using it as my baby grows and for having it as a keepsake for this precious time in our lives."
2,Annoying,The voices were annoying. I played it in the car for my son and my husband begged me to turn it off it.
5,a must-have for car rides!,"i purchased this cd along with 3 others for the car when my daughter was 7 months old. she hated being in the car, and it was so stressful for me since there was nothing i could do from the driver's seat (especially since she was rear-facing at the time). none of the other cds comforted her much, but this one has been a true lifesaver. no matter how fussy she is, the minute i turn on track 1 of this cd, she stops whining and starts listening to bob and larry! it really is amazing, and i can't say enough good things about this cd. bob and larry talk quite a bit in between the songs, but the dialogue is cute and funny, even for adults (my husband likes it too). i also like how this cd introduces my daughter to some classic christian songs, such as ""this is the day"" and ""this little light of mine."" my daughter is 14 months old now and still *loves* this cd, and it has made car rides much more peaceful for both of us!"
4,"Great for toddlers, fun for adults too","Our 16 month old is already enjoying this CD. We got it for her for Christmas and she has had a blast listening to the songs. Although she can't sing along yet, she dances to the songs and I know she will soon be singing the words. Also, there are great little moments that adults will appreciate in this CD. It's great for being in the car and always seems to keep her occupied. We love the Christian songs on this CD - they are the type of songs I want my daughter to learn. Highly recommended!"
3,Good in parts.,"The 12v adapter works ok with my Pilot 3, once I'd pushed the plug right in, but the PC interface cable doesn't.The PC will neither recognise nor power the GPS. So there's a thick cable and plug which is absolutely useless. Pity.Especially as shipping to the UK doubled the price."
4,works fine,"This is fairly bulky, but it works great. I wish it had a USB instead of serial port. The connections fit securely which is appreciated since the last one I purchased for a diff't model had very loose connections."
3,Ok,"Not bad but really was evidently not what my wife was expecting as far as a potty training video, lol"
4,FREE shipping to Puerto Rico Not Anymore,Poster looks great. I took it to a nice place where this put in a nice looking frame and it looks great on the living room. Too bad I cannot continue buying nice stuff on Amazon because they stopped shipping for free to Puerto Rico. They started this all of a sudden since Borders (biggest competition in PR) closed down a few months ago.
2,poor craftsnamship,"Hoffritz Stainless Steel Hanging Rolling PinI found this nice to work with easy to clean. The only flaw is it came apart while using within the first 5 minutes. This could be a serious problem if you have small children as they could pull it apart and it could pierce a person. It appears the end tabs should be glued to prevent this from happening. Nice heavy weight roller just bad planning to keep it together, It is an easy roller for dough and yes dough will stick to it, a little pam solves that problem. The price is okay and I recommend it over a wooden roller."
3,Nice popcorn machine but...,"Makes good popcorn once heated up but it is a tiney work area and you have to be very careful not to touch the kettle when placing the contents of the package of popcorn, butter and salt which is challenging because of the tight confining area."
5,Excellent Read,"My mom got me this book for my birthday and I have to say it is an amazing guide book for teens. Its variety and well written nature makes it amazing.Also Recommended: Quotes, Poems, and Words That Flow by Kevin Grommersch"
3,keeps breaking,The link right next to the clasp keeps breaking. I received this as a Christmas present from my husband and I'm not wearing it because I'm afraid it will fall off and I'll lose it.The bracelet is beautiful and I'm really sad that I can't wear it.
3,NICE BRACELET!,"Very nice bracelet, came in a velvet pouch. But be aware that the bracelet is alot thinner/smaller than it looks in the photo."
3,"Big woof, but the fidelity bites","The Acoustic Authority A-5640RB 5.1 woofer rattles the windows and looks impressive, but the sound quality in the other ranges bites. That monster woofer added a bunch to the shipping cost too. By comparison, my Logitech X540 was $25 less, shipping was free and it has the perfect sound for a personal computer set up-- the X540 is a great value. Both of my systems are driven by the same sound card... so apples to apples."
1,nature's gambit,"Child prodigy which defined in this book as God giving specific gift to achieve some specific task, is indeed nonexistence. The only thing I see in this book is six highly intelligent kids who had been guided to develope some specific skill such as music or chess by their parents and/or their master teachers. The author is a researcher who starts with a wrong assumption, bend his research mathod whenever he likes and at the end, has no courage to admit that his research is misguided and his research subject does not even exist.The only thing that any parent of gift children can learn from this book is: let your children be, support them but don't push them. The worst thing any parent can do is to behieve like Adam's mother in this book."
5,Very comfortable,"At the beginning were a little tight, but after that were adjusted are really comfortable."
5,Bell Tree is great,Used for about six months in church group. Love the sound and tonality of the bells. Adds to my percussionist collection in accompanying the music group.
3,Gripping...,"At the end of the first section, I had to put the book down and go and compose myself. It was emotional. Not a bad way to suck a reader in.Tess awakes in the middle of the forest, surrounded by a massacre, and can't remember anything. Not even if she had something to do with it or not.From there, she acquires a band of people searching for the evil encroaching on their land. She joins them on this quest in hopes of discovering who she is.Again, another great Luna piece, where the characters are engaging, the drama is intense, and good battles evil.My only complaint is that it is shorter than the other Lunas, coming in at 302 pages. Since it is the first of a series though, I am willing to overlook that and wait impatiently for the next installment."
4,Interesting,"I enjoyed this book since the characters were very human. You could relate to the decisions and the confusion they went through. It was a very nice story line and i was extremely upset when it ended and i want to know what happens next!I only give it four stars considering the beginning of the book was rather gruesome and gorey. Also considering i started reading it on a plane ride home and it was odd to start to settle into the book and have dreadfully horrific images come to mind.Otherwise ""Shadows of Myth"" was a very good book and an interesting read."
2,Neither romance nor fantasy,"Having heard good things about the Luna imprint, I picked up this book on ebay. Now I'm glad I didn't pay full retail price. Shadows of Myth grinds along at a slow pace with no sense of direction except our intrepid heroes on a quest with obstacles dropping in from nowhere.I found it unbelievable that by the middle the book, when I was certain who Tess was that none of the characters even mentioned it, especially considering that Archer (Think a really dull Strider) told tales all the time.This book is trying to be both romance and fantasy, and sadly doesn't suceed at either. A true dissapointment with no real worldbuilding, except various Tolkien-esque elements which make it clear this not a well-built fantasy world. I found the characters flat and the peril never truly realized."
2,Erratic operation at times,I've had this over a year and have had an ongoing problem with erratic weights being displayed when the item being weighed is a little off center. A little wiggling and fiddling will solve this but like timers and flashlights a scale is something you should be able to trust completely or its usefulness is significantly curtailed.
3,Scale works,This scale works well. It was a gift for my girlfriend who needed one for measuring things out for her weightwatchers program.
4,Good product,Careful with the glass surface! Probably should stash the top in a drawer to avoid impact. Easily switches form metric to standard. Runs on easily available button batteries. Shuts off promptly when not in use.
4,"extremely readable, hard to stop","It's hard to avoid mentioning what other reviews have already mentioned, but I'll try. Simply, Ranma half has made Takahashi Rumiko very very rich. It's not hard to understand why. The stories appeal to all people, males, females, children, teens and adults. It's humourous, it has action, and if you read carefully, there ia bit of drama as well.Rathing I gave this book reflects the whole series, some stories are very funny, others not so funny, others almost a waste of time. I personally found several stories in books 6 and 8 hilarious."
5,AWESOME,"AND IT REALLY GAVE ME THAT FEELING.THIS MANGA IS THE BEST EVER. IF U HAVEN,T READ IT, YOU,RE INSANE"
4,A Takahashi Classic,"If you liked Lum, surely you've read this.A classic tale of boy-meets-girl. And boy turns into a girl. But, only with cold water. Hot water turns him right back to his proper gender!Confused? You might be!But it always turn out to make sense, in some twisted way. So take a look into this 'graphic novel'. Perverted old men, cowardly pandas, psycho sisters, and a girl with a teenage boy for a pet! lol Okay, *I* wouldn't mind....Done in classic Takahashi style, it's not as bloody as Inu-Yasha and not as fairy tale as Lum. Right in the middle, in the world where most of us live.The curses? Um. Artistic liscense. ^.~"
5,Ranma 1/2 (Volume 1),"This is a great Manga series, when I first started noticing Manga, there was only serious types, with blood and gore. Then I came across Ranma 1/2, and I got hooked, if you love funny Manga, then this is for you! I only read the first novel, and I got hooked, I'm now intent on buying the whole series, but I'll have to wait considering all I get is an allowance, ^o^."
4,RANMA 1/2 ROCKS THE HOUSE!,I bought this book at borders and I was alredy into ranma (thanks to amazon)I thought the book was funny and both boys and girls love it.To me the art work is wonderfuland sometimes the book can tech you things.
5,Hilarious and Addictive!,"This is a hilarious story about a boy named Ranma. His father takes him to train in these cursed Springs in China. There is a story behind each spring of a creature that drowned in the spring thousands of years ago. If you fall into one, then when doused with cold water, you will turn into the form of whatever drowned in the spring you fell into. So, Ranma's father falls into ""Spring of drowned Panda."" And Ranma falls into ""Spring of drowned Girl."" ^_^ The only way to turn back into their regular forms is to be dowsed with warm water. In addition, Ranma is to be engaged! This part, gives the story a comical twist.This is a GREAT story. I recomend it for ANYONE who loves comedies! But let me warn you, the plot is very, VERY addictive!^_^ Hope you enjoy it! Any questions? E-mail me: Boopsie1@aol.com"
5,"Silly, but very entertaining story about a half boy/girl","There is no doubt that Rumiko Takahashi has a wonderful sense of humor, besides being a great artist and storyteller. Ranma 1/2 chronicles the hilarious mis/adventures of Ranma, a young man ""cursed"" with the ability to change into a well-endowed girl when doused with cold water, and to change back to normal when splashed with hot water. The other characters are fascinating too. There's Akane --Ranma's unwilling fiancée, Shampoo--the Chinese Amazon who fell in love with Ranma , Ryoga--Ranma's pseudo-friend who turns into black piglet etc. A lot of martial arts fun, identity confusion, parodies and adolescent hi-jinks."
5,Why Ranma Rocks!,This book was really funny. It's kinda pointless in the beginging but then it has a point. Girl Ranma is better then boy Ranma.
4,it's ok,the ring is ok looking. you need to order half a size smaller. it is not comfortable enough to wear all the time.(I bought this ring for my fiance and I am writing all these according to what he has said.) you need to take it off if you are working out on machines and stuff for it feels uncomfortable on the bars and all. it might be a little uncomfortable if you want to wear a glove and all. but for the price it's not too bad.
5,I like it!,"I choose silver bcz it won't look gaudy and noble. Being a mortal, I prefer wearing sth plain yet pure and clean. I am so happy to have found this ring. It is not shining and glaring. Rather, it looks gentle. Specifically, its 4mm bandwidth makes it exceptionally elegant in both its luster and shape. Once feeling ""blurred"" on the surface, just simply wear it and wash your hands with regular cleasing agent and it resumes its freshness!Every friend of mine who saw this told me that I bought the right thing and it fits me perfectly!"
2,Okay ring,I purchased this ring as a thumb ring and wasn't really thrilled with it. It's inexpensive and you pretty much get what you pay for.
3,Truth is in the middle,"I'd like to say that I'm an avid athlete, having played collegiate basketball. I bought this product, hoping that it will improve my running durability, not so much my vertical jump. I have to admit that so far I have only used the insoles to for my morning 25-35 mins runs, and frankly I can't say that my runs feel lighter. I would have expected to be less tired and much fresher when i get done running, but that's not quite the case for me. I will probably start balling pretty soon /once i feel in good enough shape/, so I'm secretly hoping the insoles are going to give me an edge on the court in terms of quickness and stamina.So, I can't really say whether this product is a success or not, as it has not done the trick for me. I'm in somewhat good shape, but I know I can be ever fitter, and I was expecting this product to help me make my runs longer and more intensive. I'd be satisfied, if it works fine on the basketball court, but that remains to be seen!"
5,They suprisingly work,"Yes, I can sufficiently say that these soles work well.I've an increased vertical, I expected less. The simply make it easier to push off the ground. (an extra couple inches)Make sure to do as the directions say and place them underneath of your current soles."
5,WORKED FOR A 30 YR OLD BALLER!!!!,"I heard about this product a few years ago,and said yeah right! Now im sold! I'm a 30 year old 230lbs.(muscular) 6ft baller after using this product i'm jumping, like i was when i was 19-20.If you ball this is a must buy!"
1,Crap,"Total crap! Don't waste your money!!!! Total waste of money, could acquire more results from plain cardboard. Again....TOTAL CRAP!!!! Save your money."
5,springbaks insoles are great,"I chose this rating because the shipping was fast and they work very good. I like that they are light and help me with my jumping and speed. I would recommend this to basketball, football, and track players."
1,Don't waste your money,"Tried them out for several games, no increase in speed or vertical. These things are thin and flimsy, I don't see how they can possibly do anything significant for anybody. Think about it, if they really did work, you would see every athlete in the world using this."
1,Hyped up trash- DO NOT BUY!!,"any 5 star review must be from a company. What a fraud. These are just little black liners, with zero spring to them or cushion or anyting. These are the Emperor's New Insoles. Well I got fooled, but I hope nobody else will. This company needs to go out of business. What a menace."
1,Not worth the money,Insoles were too narrow for my foot. May have influenced performance but I doubt it. I did not notice any difference other than having a thin piece of rubber-like material in my shoe.
1,Terrible Garbage,I bought this to increase both speed and vertical. IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING. All it did was wear out and make my shoes have disgusting stains on them. They were under my soles yet the rubbish excess from them stained the top of my shoes. They wore out in 2 months and did absolutely nothing. The BIGGEST waste of $35 in my entire life. Please do not buy these.
3,i just dont buy the hype,"The result of this product could be purely coincidence. I really don't think this thing adds anything to your vertical or makes you faster. The only thing this item may do is increase your confidence and therefore boost your performance. The downside is, it will make your shoes fit tighter since it is inserted underneath the current sole. I played with and without, don't really notice much of a difference. I mean some days I jump higher and lift more than others due to other factors like sleep, diet, etc. Who knows?"
2,No noticeable difference,"I wanted to see if these athletic insoles could improve my speed and agility but I was disappointed. I tried playing basketball with and without these insoles in the same pair of shoes. I don't feel they made any difference at all, I couldn't run any faster or jump any higher or even notice a difference. I doubt these will improve anyone else's game either, I do not recommend them."
4,great stuff,"I use this in conjunction with bio pellets in 2 separate phos ban reactors, and I have to say they are pretty awesome. I would be sure to check pricing as it seems to vary widely. LFS charge almost double what I found on amazon, but I also found the saem size going for various price (and shipping) prices. for the best price make sure you shop around."
5,Simply a must-read,"I thought I'd just grab a primer on Bolivia, but got a whole lot more when I picked this book up. This guy is so multi-faceted, you never know what he's going to write next. Nearly every passage in his work make you angry, make you take sides, make you pause with a sense of befuddlement. Sometimes I folded it in front of me just to let a particularly beautiful revelation or moment sink in.For anyone who is eager (or compelled) to learn about the actualities of Bolivia's incredible past five years, its ""war on globalization"", this is the book to read. Powers, who was one of the few ""there"", talking and sharing with those involved and wholly understands what occurred. This is apparent in his telling of the Indian road-blocks, impending rain-forest catastrophe, and the stories of real people that you can relate to.After reading William Powers, the world becomes a far stranger, grander, mythical, more intriguing--and puzzling-- place than ever before."
2,attn Ebony Hogan re: BOOTLEG,"No disrespect, but you might want to look up the definition of ""bootleg"" - unauthorized, counterfeit, etc - to make sure it conveys the meaning you intended.(If so, please forgive my intrusion.)Also: your shift key is stuck."
1,"Wish there was a ""zero"" stars option","So terrible. Just awful. Honestly, I wish i could get the hour of my life I wasted watching this trite cliche drivel back!"
2,BOOTLEG,"WHOMEVER WROTE THIS TITLE IS GOOD! HAD ME ALL EXCITED TO WATCH AN EDGY LOVE STORY. IT WAS BOOTLEG AS EVER. ONLY BENEFIT IS THAT SUPPORTED SOMEONES BEGINNING EFFORTS OF BEING A DIRECTOR, PRODUCER, ACTOR, OR ACTRESS."
2,"Darn it, another disappointment","Irishman Robin Mark burst onto the Christian music scene in 1999 with Revival In Belfast, a passionate live-in-concert mix of ballads and up-tempo worship songs. It was brilliant.However, it's becoming evident that recording is a once-in-a-lifetime success. The sequel, 2001's Come Heal This Land, had a few memorable numbers, but lots of forgettable songs, too. The same, sadly, must be said about this project.Mark seems to lack the ability to structure drama or passion into his arrangements (i.e. stops and starts, changes in key at important moments, building up to an emotional peak), so pretty much everything on RIB II lacks passion, including the audience.Fans of Revival In Belfast will also notice his voice is becoming increasingly raspy. It's not a huge problem, compared to what else I've mentioned here, but it doesn't help.Wish I could write a slam-bang endorsement for this album...I was quite excited when it came out, but now feel let-down."
3,Interesting and yet not quite satisfying,"A collection of essays on various topics by Alan Lightman - some autobiographical, some dealing with the interesting contrast and similarity of his careers in science and writing, some biographical expositions into the pscyhe of famous scientists like Einstein, Edward Teller, Richard Feynman, and Vera Rubin) and others just exploring not science itself but the 'human dimension' of science, if you will, as an enterprise. I read 10 of the 11 essays but did not find it as stimulating or interesting as his book Einstein's Dreams, which I read in the late 90s."
5,"Lightman is superb in ""A Sense of the Mysterious""","We have been blessed by writings like ""A Mathematician's Apology"" by G. H. Hardy and ""On Being the Right Size"" by J. B. S. Haldane, now we have a newer addition to this fine category of literature."
2,Read with caution,"My 6th & 7th grade language arts teacher had this book in her collection. Several people told me it was a great book, although dicey in certain parts. After reading the first few chapters, I realized this book was more than a ""little dicey."" I feel this book should never have been available in a middle school. It should be instead with adult romance novels. However, I did finish the book, skipping the sex and drug situations, because it's very well written and has an exciting plot. Thank you Leslie Deane. You wrote a wonderful novel."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"This grater is not a convenience, it's more of a punishment. I have tried it for hash browns, cheese, chocolate, etc. I thought at first I was using it incorrectly, but then realized, there really is no wrong way of using this. Everytime I have used it it has caused me so much pain in my hands that I would rather do it the old fashioned way and just grate the cheese manually. My fingers and hands ache so bad that I can't even hold a pencil after using this gadget. I would not recommend this to anyone. Unfortunately, you have to rate this with 1 being the lowest star, but in reality I give it NO STARS!!"
2,A big dissapointment,"If you're of Italian heritage and you grate a lot of cheese, don't waste your time with this one. When the quantity of cheese in the grater gets low, it tends to be very difficult to turn. It also didn't last as long as I expected. Try a different one instead."
2,Sorry I bought it,"This grater is fine when you can get it to work, but most often the handle doesn't screw in correctly and you can't get it to. It's mostly a waste of time, though the concept is a great one. I'd recommend trying maybe a stainless steel one instead of this plastic one."
2,Not for lefties,"The right-handed folks in my family like this little gadget and manage to get nice, fluffy Parmesan out of it, but my daughter and I are left-handed and find it very awkward to turn the crank. I wish you could screw it together both ways for lefties and righties. Also, I think it would be much more durable and work better when the cheese block gets small if it was made of metal parts instead of plastic."
2,Don't Be Deceived...,"Despite the description, this ""Stainless Steel"" grater is plastic with a stainless barrel. From the description, I thought that the ENTIRE UNIT was stainless. Although the exterior is a heavy-duty plastic, it is plastic, nonetheless; not too much different than the cheapo version that I already own!"
3,ALMOST.....,"I'd like to say it was as heart felt and as touching as Sounder or Where The Red Ferns Grow, but it wasn't. I'd like to say the that the maturation process of the main character is unique and intriquing like that of a Holden Caulfield, but its not. Andrew Cowan has the all the craft to make Pig a great read but craft isn't reason enough to want to continue turning the pages."
3,Could have been better.,"I'm sorry, but I have to say that this book didn't go anywhere. It started off with some heart-felt feeling and there were times in the story that you can really feel the depression, loneliness and sadness but the story never fully developed and it left you wondering. I kept waiting for ""Pig"" to take off and get to the point of what Mr. Cowan was trying to make but it fell short of the mark repeatedly. I feel that overall, this book could have been so much better. It had a lot of potential but it just didn't make the grade. I gave it three stars for it's originality and for the emotion that certain parts of the story evoke."
5,"Very informative, original and full of tips","According to many this is the best book on the south pacific ever written and i have to admit that it is probably the truth. The book is very informative, full of tips on everyday life, customs, history, economy, politics and curiosities and written with a very personal touch and originality by the author.it is really full of useful informations, Even if the book is from 2004 is still very valid and helpful. Recommended. You will see that is different from usual guidebooks"
2,Inconsistent Performers,I bought 4 sets of these at an Amazon sale a little over a year ago. I found them to be highly variable. One set is terrific and continues to perform well after a year. Another initially worked well but now has only one remaining light working (not a bulb problem as I have switched terminals to no effect) but at least it is bright. The other two sets do not work at all. I tried replacing the batteries with high end Sony rechargeable AAs to no avail. I sent an email to Malibu about the problems I have had with these lights over 6 months ago but never received a reply.
3,Solar flood light,A good price but the item was not a bright as I hoped it would be.Besides that I am satisfied with the purchase.
5,Work nicely actually,"Ordered these lights after reading mostly positive reviews. They work for exactly what I need them to do. Highlight a small maple in my yard and a couple of evergreens in the flowerbed. I ordered just one to test myself before ordering another set for the other side of the house. Like most have said, the light is not the brightest in the world, but much, MUCH better than LED's used to be. It highlights landscaping nicely. My neighbor has incandescent, and mine looks a little bluer/crisper, but I think it looks nice, PLUS I don't have to run wires or have a big transformer block plugged in."
2,Works great.... for 1 year.,"I bought 2 of these and they both worked great for about 1 year. Lights seam ok, must be the solar panel. It comes with a 2 year warranty so we'll see how Intermatic is with service....more to come.Update.... after 1 week Intermatic set me 1 replacement solar panel. The whole process was done on online, and I think they missed the part where I said I bought 2....more to come.2nd Update.... Intermatic sent a second solar panel."
5,Just what I wanted,"I ordered these for lighting my new Koi pond. It's a small pond, about 10 by 10 feet under a porch area about 5 feet above ground.The kit included plenty of wire to run around and after a short one day charge the lights worked very well. I was worried they may be too bright but no they were perfect for this application.I'd guess that they were similar to about 15 watt incandescent bulbs. They really show of the waterfall and don't draw attention to the light heads. The black color of the fixtures blends in well and with a bit of care in placing them they are hard to see. All around I think they are a good purchase for gentle lighting. I'm a happy customer."
1,Don't last,"Light output was fine, but these started acting up after 6 months. Basically it is a bad design as water gets in the charger. Once this happens the connections corrode and make the lights dim."
4,was surprised at how well,the product worked. Not a brilliant light but lights up enough to see my patio area well which is what I wanted. Easy to adjust direction of lights and cords to solar panel actually too long for what I needed!
4,Pretty good lights,"I had no problem setting up these lights. They work pretty well. In fact the first night they were installed, my wife got up because they were so bright she thought she had left the front proch light on. I adjusted them not to shine on the bedroom window and all was well."
5,solar powered flood lites,"We have a new water feature with stone all around. The water feature has a water fall and we used the ""Malibu 3-Pack Solar with the remote solar panel"". When the sun sets the water garden lites up with a romantic blue glow. I wanted to lite up the space with least amount of effort possible. These lights have the smallest wires and could be hidden in the smallest cracks in the stone.Anchoring them was not a problem, just took the stakes and turned them 90 degrees and laid them under a stone. The price is also very attractive. I am considering ordering another set for another location."
4,lighted stairway,"I mounted these 3 lights under the edge of a deck to illuminate the stairway down one side of it and along the walkway 9 feet down. They are not bright, but I can see where I am walking or shoveling snow at night. These are exactly what I expected. They work well even when the day has been overcast, and my panel, to be out of the way, is in direct sun only about 4 hours a day.The wires are long enough to allow good spacing. I am trying to think of other places to use them!"
4,Great Value for the $,"I had low expectations for this type of lighting, but I was pleasently suprised after a couple of days of using them. The solar panel stores enough power with about 7 hours of sunlight to run the three lights for most of the night. They emit more than enough light to highlite just about anything you have in your yard. I used mine on a halloween display of pumkins and cornstalks. I don't think anyone will be dissapointed with these lights at Amazons very reasonable price. SAJ Northern New England."
4,Better than expected,"I bought these to shed some light on my driveway to prevent me from nailing the garbage can when I back out in the dark. So far, so good. They were easy to set up -- and I must say intuitive because the directions were a joke. No matter. I'll probably buy a couple more sets."
2,Not worth it,"I read the reviews and even though my expectations were not very high, I purchased a set. Not even my already low expectations were met. As somebody mentioned, flashlights are more powerful than these lights. They are white LED's, so the light is rather ghostly: blueish and very dimmed. Don't buy them unless you are looking for a rather undefined glow in a very limited spot. Another piece of advice: make sure you have a spot for the solar charger that remains exposed to the sun for most of the day. Otherwise, these lights are a one-night show. More powerful batteries will not help. On a positive note, I was well impressed by the construction: rather sturdy and good quality plastic."
2,Consistency Problem,"I ordered two sets of these lights from Amazon and two from another major retailer. The sets were totally different as far as light they put out. The solar collector fronts looked different. One looked sleek, the other like I put it together in my garage. One set put out acceptable light and I was very happy. The second set no where near the light. The inside lamp reflectors didn't even look the same. If this company is going to have such obvious inconsistencies in outsourcing and manufacturing their product, why not let me know - hey Bob, it's hit or miss! Now I have to pack them up, ship them back. A hassle - and a bad name for solar. A waste of my time overall and takes the mystery out of the good and bad reviews here."
5,I LOVE THESE LIGHTS!,"I mounted these light above my front door with the screw base mounts. They light the area perfectly!Even on cloudy overcast days, the batteries charge.My only gripe was that the wires were WAYYY to long for my use. A snipper and eletrician tape took care of that!Will buy several more soon."
4,Not bad at all....,"I think this is more a matter of expectations, if you are looking for security lights then these are not the lights for you. If you want accent lights for your landscaping these are more than bright enough to do the job. Granted I live in the tropics so sunshine is not a problem, but I've been very happy with my purchase."
1,wont buy here again...,the show itself is great but when i got the package the drill was missing and one of the discs was a bit scratched up. so much for being new. will never buy from this seller again if.
5,Great product! Promptly shipped!,"Good price for the product with super quick shipping! The LED light is also a plus! All in all, why don't they make more collectors boxes like this?"
2,Cute sweater but cheaply made,"I bought these sweaters for my dachshunds and they fit their long bodies very nicely. They are a nice rich color with contrasting neck and arm holes. Conveniently, they have an opening on the back for harnesses.I would love to have given these sweaters 5 stars and ordered more (my dogs love to stay warm during the cold high-desert winters!) But after only one use the arm ripped out of the sweater. There wasn't any exercise orplaying going on - just normal dog activity around the house. On one side almost the whole arm-hole is coming apart from the rest of the sweater.I had to cancel the sweater that I had back-ordered because I would rather pay a little more and have a sweater that at least made it to the wash before having to throw it away! The other sweater seems to be holding up okay. The material pilled up quite a bit after washing, but still wearable. So I am 1/2 - not bad but not great. Buyer beware :)"
2,runs small,"I had bought a pink sweater in small and it was just rite, but the small in this color is way too small. very tight around her body and hinders from walking well."
5,Love this!,Fits my dog (a 9lb rat terrier) perfectly. Seems to be very comfortable and the leg straps keep it from sliding up.
4,Nice,"The leg bands are a little too stretchy for my liking, but it fits like it says it will. It keeps my chahuahua warm, but some how between the time I put it on him when we go to bed and morning he has wiggled himself out of it. (He must be a wiggle worm when he sleeps)"
2,Not as practical as I expected,"I am disappointed in this book. I expected some practical and detailed suggestions for activities to incorporate in my college classroom. Instead, I got vague, general suggestions that, to a college instructor who has a background in education as well as my content area, seem like mostly common sense. I would recommend this book only for new teachers who have little or no background in education."
2,Sober and quite outdated,I did not find this book too useful. It is written in a very sober style and the writer assumes that all of us still use old fashioned methods such as writing intensively on the chalkboard and overhead projectors.
3,Not what I thought but still decent,"I bought these thinking they were 100% Stainless. They weren't. They were chrome plated steel and stainless. They do function well so all it not lost. The rusty chrome ones I replaced these with were the reason I wanted all stainless. The stainless portions are the handles and the cutting mechanism. The plate the mechanism attaches to is chrome. I prefer when a product is advertised as ""Stainless Steel"", that all metal portions of said product are Stainless Steel.Jim"
3,"Attractive and sturdy, but a bit uncomfortable","I was looking for an attractive can opener, that could be easily cleaned.Pros: Attractive design with a sharp blade that opens cans easily. Went through the dishwasher without a problem and came out shinny and clean.Con: The handle isn't padded. It's slightly uncomfortable when I have to grip the handles while opening a can. If I had joint or dexterity problems this would be a real issue. I have small hands, perhaps people with large hands don't have as much of a problem.I don't open many cans so I will continue to use it, but next time will look for an opener with a padded grip."
4,Good introduction to media advocacy,"This was assigned reading for my graduate level course in health communications. Admittedly it was a little hard to get into (not sure if it was because I had to read it or if it was a bit thick). I'm glad a got past the beginning introductory and descriptive stuff because the rest of the book was great! It offers a different perspective on health communications and really stimulated my thinking about how to use the media and how the media is used. I found the examples Wallack, et al., used were the most educational in understanding media advocacy and public health."
1,Received in damaged condition,Sent it back due to its damaged condition. Substituted a Wuhan cymbal in its place and really liked the Wuhan a lot.
3,"ZBT 16"" Crash Cymbal -Sheet Bronze, Entry Level","Overall this is not a bad option for an entry level cymbal. It's price accordingly and will get the job done. Someone with more years playing and a good ear will definately be turned off by the tinny sound but it delivers pretty well. It does not fade as quickly as advertised but is a brillant crash. If you used this for practice or thrashing while not wanting to damage your ""good"" cymbals this is the way to go.Pros:Priced rightSturdy, good for heavy playLooks goodCons:Does not fade as quickly as advertisedTinny and unbalanced feel compared to cast bronze"
2,Very thick,I wanted a clear crispy crash sound but this one was literally very thick and gave me more like a ride sound. It may be perfect for other people but was not for me. At least this cymbal should be very sturdy.
2,Great Expectations,"That should've been the title since the intresting theory it suggests is enticing. But unfortunately, the author turns this into another cheesy, cliché paperback thriller. One expects long Crichton like essay discussions on religon, but instead we're treated to a horny priest and a female scientist who is, of course, exceptionally beautiful. Sad."
3,Like it. Loves it not.,Found myself really wanting to get into this book but never really could. I did like the way she started each chapter with a reference to her life with her former fiancé. Just really could not get into her relationship with Henry. I liked him but never could see him as a committed guy & the ending really turned me off. It left me wondering how in the world they were going to make this relationship work. He probably won't give up his career & late nights with female clients & Ame doesn't seem to have enough self-esteem to accept this. I really would have liked to read more about how it ended instead of the very abrupt ending we get.
4,October RDI,"I wasn't sure what to think of this book. Some parts I loved, while other parts made me angry.Amy, the main character, was in an accident with her fiance, Rick, who didn't make it through it. It's been 2 years since his death and she still hasn't gotten over what happened. I like the fact that she's trying to get on with her life... put the past behind her, when she meets a man named Henry. They go on one date and she sleeps with him and is proud of it (one thing I didnt like about this book).Now I don't want to ruin the rest of the book, so I'll tell you this is worth a read."
3,"Loves Me, Loves Me Not","Amy's life has been in a downward spiral beginning with a car wreck that killed her fiance'. Now, crises are piling up at a rapid click. Her home has been sold out from under her, her workplace is going out of business, and life seems to move from bad to worse in general. Then, she gets the chance to find out if Henry Castle, her steadiest floral customer is really so wonderful as to be able to have a succession of unforgettable nights with a different girl each week, as his bouquet orders would indicate. Is he simply a serial monogamist, a gigalo, or is Henry the real deal?*** Though there really isn't much depth of characterization in this first person POV lightweight read, it has a simplicity and sweetness that compensates for that. The way in which it all works out packs a bit of a punch, and you will learn more about the language of flowers. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,not sure who this book is for...,"I bought this book for my daughter, and just wanted to ""check it out,"" before giving it to her. I'm confused. This book touches some mature themes (rape, some ""rituals"" performed by Amazon women with captured men), suggesting it is targeting adult readers, but it reads like a story for kids. Simplistic fairy tale, mixes a few elements of history with feministic propaganda. This is a great theme - perfect for building the ""girl pride,"" but the execution fails miserably. I hope someone else tries to pick it up, and does a better job."
5,an amazingly well written story,I thought this book was incredibility well written and had a great storyline. The author kept my attention page after page to the point where I couldn't put the book down. She writes as if she actually lived in this time period and makes you feel as if you're actually going through everything Rain is.
3,Okay for what I paid for it,"I guess it could depend on the person whether or not this will help stimulate arousal. I liked it okay, there are other things I've liked better but it's not bad for what I paid for it."
5,My Second One,"I love XM2GO, but was tired of carrying the office unit home every night. At this price, I was able to have a second, complete unit at home to compliment my two car units and the one that I now leave in the office."
2,Not great,Not as good or as funny as other books. Very slow going. Not worth the money. I'd read the reviews before buying my next bill bryson
3,Not what I expected,"This book is designed for the absolute beginner. It assumes you do no exercise, and gives you a daily goal/program every day for 90 days, gradually increasing both time and distance.As I am not a beginner, this book offered me very little."
4,motivational emphasis,"Fundamentally a motivational book with the structure of a calendar. Designed to push and encourage for that 90 day period it takes to form a new better habit. Like walking. Like exercise.Each day introduces a new idea, 2 pages per day of nice, simple, straightforward information. Not a hard read at all, but after it is over you learned something, but better yet may now find walking a habit.Good beginner book."
5,Walking doesn't get any better then this!,This book has helped motivate and educate me on the aspects of fitness through walking. I highly suggest getting this book. This is the step into the right direction for a healthy long lasting life!
1,welsh springer spaniel:acomplete reliable handbook,"ANNE WALTONS BOOK FAR BETTER BOOK IN DEPTH AND VOLUME, WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY FOR MORE INFO .I FOUND THE ABOVE BOOK BASIC AND I AM A NOVICE."
2,"Great cover photo, but mediocre overall.","I have to disagree with the other reviews. I felt the book was very much ""one of a series"" of breed books. The photos and text seemed sterile and lacking enthusiasm. I preferred Anne Walton's book."
5,Non-Cookie-Cutter dog book with glossy photos,This book is written by a Welsh Springer breeder/enthusiast. Many photos; they are glossy photo quality. Other dog books seem to come from a series with the same chapters except for 1 or 2 about the dog on the cover.
2,"Quisiera Darle Mas Estrellas, Pero...","No les puedo decir lo desilusionada que quedé con este CD. Espero que para la próxima, Marlon de aleje de Univision y se junte con alguien como Emilio Estefan para que pueda producir un CD que mejor luzca la voz magnifica de Marlon.A lo mejor pensaban que grabar las mismas canciones en dos diferentes estilos les ayudaría a escojer a las emisoras de radio, para que se pueda escojer cual les guste mas, pero, ¿para que necesitamos nosotros tener esto? Una voz tan importante como la de Marlon debe lucir, y en este CD, bueno - les digo que lo esuché una vez y ahora coje polvo.Espero que lo próximo de Marlon sea de mejor calidad."
3,"A train wreck, but...","The previous reviewer generally trashed this, and maybe I can see why, but I had never heard ""Bangkok"" before, and if I could play, I would play that."
2,So-so,"I wouldn't give this more than two stars due to poor design, odd shape and lack of sufficient padding. I'm still looking for a simple slip on-off case for my camera."
3,Worth a read.,"This is an enjoyable story. Not one of George R.R. Martin's best, but it's a good read. His writing style has evolved over the past 25 years and its very interesting to go back and read one of his earlier works to contrast it with A Game of Thrones and its sequels. For anyone having problems finding the book (Amazon's main site has listed it as out of print), try the Amazon UK site. This book, along with Fevre Dream, another book by G.R.R.M., was recently republished in the U.K. and was available at the Amazon UK site in January 2001 when I purchased it."
2,Stay away.,This book should take a day or two to read...but it took me about two months. The main character is so annoying that I wanted him to die and that is the only reason I finished it.George has come a long way from this book...so don't lose faith in him with this horrible start to his career.
2,mediocre Martin,"I am a fan of George R.R. Martin despite the fact that his works are difficult to find, but this book was not one of his better ones. It is imaginitive, but I could not quite identify with the characters."
3,Not bad,"I tried this book out based on the fact that I'm a huge fan of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series. The best parts of the book inolve his extensive world building and impressively imagined histories for each of the many divergent cultures in the book. His characterization at times is a little weaker than his current writing, and his plotting isn't as sure-footed either. There are long pieces through the middle of the book which get a bit tedious to read, but almost all can be forgiven thanks to an exciting, propulsive ending that's a real page turner. All in all, not bad."
3,"Awfully boring, but eventually redeeming","I borrowed this from the library and am actually pretty glad I did because it wasn't really a gripping page turner that you might expect from GRRM after reading ASOIAF. My biggest problem with the book is that for the first 50% or so of the book you really don't get to know the characters very well. I found myself wondering why I should even care about Dirk, Gwen, Jaan, or Garse and I was well into the novel.I do have to give him credit for his world-building, though. Although he takes hundreds of pages to do it, you end up with a very good grasp of Worlorn and High Kavalaan history. I plodded my way through more than half of the novel before I finally started taking an interest. I did thoroughly enjoy the last half and wish that the excessive pining of Dirk had been dropped.Not something I'd care to own, so if you can borrow it, do so."
3,Good but not quite great,"I really enjoyed the book and all its symbolism, but I was expecting more from this book and I did not get it. It's really good and keeps you gripped but I just expected more"
4,"Beautiful, imaginative","I first read this book several years ago, and I've searched it out and reread it twice. The imagery and the concepts are out of sight. Martin has created two of the most original worlds in literature, the world of the teyn and the frozen world. I was somewhat disappointed in the resolution of the story. I wanted to stay longer."
5,Leaves you wanting more...,"I have to say, when I bought this book, I was skeptical. I love GRRM's series, 'A Song of Ice and Fire', and being his latest work, in contrast to 'Dying of the Light' which is over two decades older, I had very high expectations.However, my expectations were most definately fulfilled. I was left with a permanent engraving of Worlorn and it's people, and I have fleeting memories, as if I'd spent time where myself.As always, GRRM's ability to draw in his readers is well shown, and my permanent attachment to Dirk, and ""Jenny"" will last long long after I turned that last page.Thank you again George!"
5,Pure Inspiration,"When my sister gave me this book for my birthday, it was one of the greatest presents I ever received. I was inspired, comforted, and emboldened by Masereel's wordless tale of a questing spirit. Despite the fact that I've read it literally hundreds of times (almost every night when I was working in Calcutta), I always see something new in the subtle, highly expressive woodcuts. Besides the brilliance of his technique, the story Maserel tells is exciting, complex, hilarious and moving. A treaure I wouldn't trade for practically anything."
2,Couldn't get too far into it.,There is a certain simplicity in writing that some people pass up in favor of a more literary/textbook style. That's what I found when I opened this book. While I'm sure there are many beautiful ideas within I could not bring myself to get past the first 20 pages.
5,5 stars is not enough....,"As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse I found this book to be very accurate in its description of the affects which it has on a person. This book will stick with me a long time and I hope even though it is long, readers will give it the chance it deserves. I thought this work by Mr. Iles to be very insightful."
2,Depressing depravity,"I usually like Greg Iles' novels, but this one did me in. I was exhausted by the horrors and depravity experienced by the characters. The characters are not even likeable or sympathetic. They are flat and one dimensional. Their stories became repetitive and tiring. I had trouble finishing the book once; I cannot imagine wanting to read it a second time."
4,"Well written, but be prepared for grim","Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book. I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender. I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side. The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie. In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen.As an aside, I remain amazed and impressed that Iles can so effectively write a novel in the first person in which the character speaking is a female sufferring from the effects of sexual abuse.Not a five star, but a solid four."
2,A Disappointment,It is a long book. I am sure the author wanted to make the most of the problem of child sexual abuse and he did. Somehow the heroine Cat gets kicked out of medical school but returns to study dentistry. Evidently the dental school was more forgiving and didn't care if she had a thing for her teachers. Then she jumps into forensic dentistry-and we all know how much that is in demand in a city the size of New Orleans. No wonder she drinks constantly as she does'nt have anything else to do most of the time. Also the solution may be immaginative but bite marks of the nature described take a lot of muscle power and I don't think could be duplicated the way it is depicted in the book. I did read the whole thing so some interest was there.
5,Intriguing characters. Great story.,"His characters are so detailed and real it's easy to imagine you're part of the story. There's so much passion in his words, it's more than obvious Greg Iles loves Natchez, Mississippi. I've never been there but feel like I know the town, almost as if I could drive through right now and point out landmarks I've never seen in person. It's like I would know them based on his descriptions.I was on the edge of my seat for the entire book, Cat Ferry is the main character and the secrets she uncovers about her own life while trying to solve a crime is tantalizing. It was impossible to put down, the detailed forensics and female character made this book a must read. Greg Iles' best book so far."
5,Southern Bloody Gothic,"Like a piece of gravel shot at one's windshield, Greg Iles' newest Up-All-Night page turner starts in the middle and webs its way out. This dark and unflinching incestuous Southern saga of serial slaughters is fleet of pace and crewed by characters the reader will not soon - if ever - forget. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
4,Great Book! Greg Isles never disappoints me!,Turning Angel was a page turner for me so I bought BLood Memory. WOW! It did not disappoint me!
4,What NOT To Do When You're Expecting...,"I guess it's high praise for Mr. Iles that he managed to get me screaming at our heroine at all her dumb exploits that had the potential to harm or kill her unborn child: free-diving, drinking, Valium, baths in scalding water.This was a thoroughly gripping book that at 764 pages long, I was sad to see come to an end. Greg Iles doesn't shy from the sensitive subject of pedophilia and tackles it with unflinching honesty.There is no way to guess the NOMURS ""bad guy"" in this book til the very end (I don't care what the Australian said who apparently solved the mystery in the first chapter) but I'm disappointed that the author did not interweave the Natchez and New Orleans crimes better.It does get repetitive like some said, but I still highly recommend this book if you're looking for a taut, atmospheric suspense mystery. Very well-written and fresh."
4,Always satisfying,"Mr. Iles could write on a lizard in the middle of the desert and make it a fine novel. Each of his renderings is on a different subject and at finishing you sit and think about what you have just experienced. That is a Writer. I have read all of his books and there is not one I have not enjoyed. I will stay away from the content of this one but you can read the flyer on the inside cover and realize what a interesting book it is. Take some time and read a good one, this is it."
3,Okay book,"The book is good and it is worth reading. If you took out the character repeating her thoughts over and over you would have a 400 page book. I feel the story was good, but the over writing was to much. This book needs some serious editing."
2,Toooooo Long,"Having read a couple other Greg Iles books, I thought this would be worthwhile. I don't doubt that the issues the author deals with are important, but 512 pp about this alcoholic, manic-depressive, obsessive, schizophrenic self-centered woman was just too tedious. It's hard to get into a lengthy book when you strongly dislike the main character. Half as long would have been twice as good."
5,MUST READ!,"This is the first Greg Isles book that I have read, and I plan on buying every one! He is a wonderful author. I could not put this book down! It is one of the best books that I have read in a LONG TIME!!!"
4,Great Read,"This was my 1st impulse buy, now I am a new fan, I liked this book and could not stop reading. This is a great buy. Page turner bite the nails.I just started to buy all of Giles's books but so far I haven't gone wrong with any."
4,Suspenseful reading,"I couldn't put this book down. The story jumped right in and took you down many twists and turns. The vivid writing is not for weak of heart and the book is very graphic. And if you are like me and love CSI books, this is an excellent one.And if you are looking for a good summer read to lose yourself in, this is a great book. But if you are looking for something with more depth, I wouldn't recommend it. There are no real life lessons learned here."
3,I can't believe I read the whole thing,"This book was odd, a fictional story about a serial killer that actually spent very little time dealing with the murders. The author chose to spend more time dealing with the mystery surrounding the shooting of the heroine's father years ago. Cat Ferry became obsessed with finding out the truth behind her father's death which occurred when she was a little girl. Was there a connection between what happened then and the serial murders? Cat was also working to solve the serial killings. I didn't have any trouble following the book until all of a sudden Cat had an ""Aha!"" moment and knew who the murderer was. Either I missed something or slept through that part, but I never figured out how she suddenly knew who the murderer was. I can't be the only reader who was left scratching their head. The parts of the book dealing with Cat's family were interesting to me; the rest was not. The overall feeling to me was amateurish."
2,This book goes on and on!,"In the beginning,it seemed to me like this book would be a great mystery, but then it changed themes and became another mystery. The writer tried to intertwine two mysteries together and to me it seemed to go on and on taking many unnecessary sidetracks to come to completion."
3,Not Very Good,"This book needed to be edited better. There's way too much internal thoughts which gets to be boring and slows the pace down. This book seemed to go on forever, it could have been a couple hundred pages shorter. I'd never read this author before and was disappointed."
5,Great,Great book and a page turner for me. I love all his books. Great plots and the characters are drawn out well
4,Great read,Good read. Once you start reading it is hard to put down. It is has twist and turn an exciting read.
5,An entertaining thriller about child abuse? YES!!!!!!,"Greg Iles is one of my favorite authors. His last two books have really disappointed me though. 'Sleep No More' was about souls switching bodies, and 'Footprints Of God' was just a boring Dan Brown rip-off. So when I heard the plot for 'Blood Memory' I was a bit leary. A thriller about child abuse? Iles actually pulls it off though. Blood Memory is the best book I've read this year. It is more than just a thriller, it reads like ""To Kill A Mockingbird'. A fantastic portrait of life in the south. Iles characters jump off the page like they are real people living in Natchez, Mississippi right now. Buy this book, you will not regret it."
4,"Fun read, somewhat predictable","This was the first Greg Iles novel I've read. It was entertaining and did have me reading longer than my ""normal allotted time."" I felt it was somewhat predictable and felt that after the number pages of spent early the ""wrap up"" was rushed. I will consider reading another Greg Iles novel."
3,Dead Weight,"I stayed with this one till the end and am not sure who or what wore out first the reader or the story. 496 pages of heavy duty lyricism with flatbed characters is a tough read for me.If you enjoy an almost Gothic tension for a degenerated Southern stereotype with a mood as oppressive as an oil soaked swamp then this suspense thriller is for you.Catherine ""Cat"" Ferry does not solve all her problems in BLOOD MEMORY, but she intrigues you with her struggles. Read it on a bight sunny Southern day and it's not so gloomy.Writing as a Small BusinessSins of the Fathers: A Brewster County NovelNatchez Above The River: A Family's Survival In The Civil War"
4,Well worth reading,"Greg Iles is a new experience for me, I love to read this type of book. I love the adventure, the plot, the way he carried it out. I don't know how I've missed reading his books until now. I found this book entertaining and well worth my time. I do find he tends to ""ramble"" rather like Stephen King, however not so much in this particular book. I did have a bit of a problem with a male writing a female persona however I think he pulled it off. I do plan to read more of his books in the future."
4,A difficult subject to make interesting.,"Mr Iles took me on an adventure with this heroine. She was not someone I would probably ""hang out with"" in real life but when I learned more about her sordid past -- you sort of feel guilty for judging her too quickly. At the end, it wasn't the best book I ever read, but while I was reading it I couldn't put it down. I just had to know how all the threads were tied together. I couldn't give it more than 4 stars -- but I would recommend it. It is not an easy subject to write about that is for sure."
4,Read It in 2 Days,"If you're interested in forensics, chances are you'll like this book. The book also manages to tie in sexual abuse, repressed memories, Miss., Vietnam, PTSD, and a little romance. It even broaches the topic of multiple personality disorder but does not linger there long. I was impressed by the breadth of knowledge that made this book's plot and discussions as intricate as they are."
4,"What a great read....disturbing, but excellent....","Greg Iles has slowly become one of my favorite authors....Spandau Phoenix, black cross and now blood memory were great.....This is gripping, fast paced and scary.....What a world we live in?"
4,I liked it.,I really appreciate that Iles can write about many topics. And he does extensive research about each one. This is no exception. He does a very accurate job of describing mental health issues and how people suffer from them. Good book. I enjoyed it.
5,His best yet,"After being mildly disappointed with Greg's last couple of biooks, Blood Memory was a total delight and surprise. His imagination combined with writing skills made this 700 page book seem more like 300 pages. I am a slow reader, but had no trouble getting through Blood Memory faily quickly as I could not put it down. Two mysteries in one with characters so real you may think they are your best friends or your neighbors. If his new book is even 1/2 as good as Blood Memory it will be a blessing."
3,kept my attention...,"This was my first Greg Iles book, but now am searching for some of his other works to see if it holds up to this one.Blood Memory had me guessing up until the middle of the book and I had the ending somewhat figured out, but it didn't deter from the book any. I still wanted to read on to see what happened to all of the characters.I recommended this book to my husband and now he is hooked as well."
3,Murder Mystery and then some.,"This story takes place in New Orleans where a serial predator has been killing middle-aged men. The plot revolves around Cat Ferry, an expert on teeth. Cat is the alcoholic granddaughter of Dr. William Kirkland, who is a rich powerful man and ends up in a relationship with her married detective lover, Sean Regan.Iles weaves in dark strains of child sexual abuse and the resulting repressed memories as Cat searches for the serial killer and for answers about her father's death.I found the book to be too long really and I could not believe that one woman could endure that much trauma and threats to her life and just pick up and move on to the next phase of her life so quickly. One minute she is running for her life and the next she is sitting at a table trying to solve several murders. I admit that it did keep me guessing and reading, but it wasn't entirely believable for me."
5,Dixie Chicks inspiration?,"The instant I heard the Dixie Chicks belt out ""GOODBYE EARL"" Margaret Moseley's ""Bonita Faye"" came to mind. Okay, so the black-eyed peas were a departure, the heart and humor of the song and Moseley's terrific mystery read are still very much alike. Don't miss this chance to laugh, cry and empathize with a woman you may never actually meet (Faye, not Moseley). Don't miss the chance to learn to love an author (Moseley not Faye) on her way up...up...up!"
3,light but fun,I enjoyed this book but on a somewhat superficial level. It was frustrating because there were so many characters that I could have really liked if there was something more to them. In a way that is part of the problem because it is hard to believe that so many of the people that Bonita Faye meets go out of their way to help her before they really know her. I enjoyed the book but it missed being really good
1,Was there an editor? Contrived and Tedious,"This is one of the silliest books I've ever read. The characters were original, but they all spoke like actors in cheap movies. Lines like a stewardess saying ""It will be almost four hours to Paris even on the Concorde."" are common. This is how the author tries to get information across - by having the characters over explain in a stilted lifeless way, most with ""cute"" accents. The title character's husband and ex both call her an ""idiot"" and ""stupid woman"" knocking her down on a gravel walkway, and then walk off together to buy each other a drink. This is played for laughs.How this book was nominated for an Edgar Award, I'll never know. Must have been a bad year for first novels"
1,ZERO,I found it to be downright flat & boring. Funny? Nope it wasn't funny. It wasn't interesting either. It was very shallow and read like a manual.
2,Contrived,"Likable characters, but the plot is just ""too convenient"". If you are willing to forego reality this book is a flight of fancy, with no real substance."
1,Here we go again.,"This book contains the usual worn out far left liberal drivel that college profesors have been trying to shove down the throats of uninformed students since the 60's. In particular, the author's attempt to blame crime on poverty, etc. etc. leaves me nauseous. Has he ever considered that our culture's failure to teach its young about moral absolutes might be a contributing factor? He is entitled to his opinions, however misinformed they may be, but the book should come jacketed with a warning label."
5,Gnius,"I found Reiman's work to be of high scholarly value to any critical thinker regardless of field. He willingly unravels myths that have long banded our eyes to the deeper anomalies and injustices of this 'criminal' 'justice' SYSTEM. Hopefully, others in related fields will follow his example, not readily accepting the obvious impression as a true impression, but to test what is a real image and what is distorted."
5,A huge wake-up call on our failing justice system,"Everything in this book seems to make so much sense, but why can't more people think this way? Our justice system in honestly going nowhere, and truthfully it is doing nothing to prevent crime, let alone rehablitate criminals. Recidivism-70% SAD! Something needs to be done, and I love the arguments presented in this book. Now we can back ourselves up in arguments on the topic of crime. I highly recommend this book to sociologists and anyone currently working in the justice system. We need to wake up!"
3,Nice but I expected more,These headphones have a nice sound but seem to be lacking a certain depth of fullness. I need to squeeze them in tight to my ears to hear the depth I am looking for. For the price they could have been better. You probably could get a better sound with something less pricey.
4,Great sound,Great sound but I can't use them for over 90 min in one session - otherwise my ears are too hot. I wear glasses and didn't find these headphones a problem with that.Recommended!
4,Sony headphones,"My neighbors suggested, indirectly, that I buy some headphones. Not big music fans, I guess. I've been buying Sony products for quite a while, with very few problems. For price and quality, good deal. I do suggest you also buy Sony RK-G138 audio connect, unless your La-Z-Boy is 6 feet away from your entertainment center. I would also like to thank Amazon cusomer support. They seem to get many regative reviews. I have not had one problem and have ordered over 25 products."
1,Headphones,DO NOT PURCHASE THESE. These are not good headphones for the price you can buy much better ones. They broke after a few months. I managed to fix them and then the other side fell off. Not good sound quality. Everyone around you can hear what your lsitening to and you can hear everything around you when you use these. Very poorly made cheap materials. My friend also had a pair of these which broke on her too after only a couple of months.
1,LOUSY SOUND,"I purchased these today,and am sending them back tomorrow cause the sound SUCKS! There is no bass at all on these,cant believe I wasted my time with them."
3,Darn good chitlin' circuit potboiler,"Williams is a chitlin' circuit veteran who'll work with two guys mugging their portable Casios if it's a paying gig, so it's nice to hear him with a decent band.He's in fine voice here, delivering the material with the ingratiating style typical of folks on the circuit. The band works a low-key, smooth version of Chicago blues, which gives Williams more of an edge than he's had on his previous, Malaco-type records.""Cold Shot"" is a good showcase for an underrated singer. With a good band and good material, Williams sounds as good as most.And another thing... If I weren't singlehandedly trying to stop the grade inflation here at Amazon, I'd give this record 4 stars."
1,OM Absolute Hindu Symbol Yoga Bracelet,"This is a very pretty, dainty bracelet. But the clasp broke after only wearing the item twice. I have an office job and am not rough, the clasp was just too thing and soft and it came right off - not even a way for me to fix. Won't buy again.Also bought a black nylon necklace that the same thing happened. Whatever you're using for the clasps isn't strong enough for even gentle use."
5,Excellent BizTalk book,"As a developer, I bought BizTalk Unleashed to evaluate the capabilities of BizTalk Server 2002. Specifically, I looked at how it can be used in EDI transaction processing and how to use .NET (VB.NET/C#) and I was impressed because the book has excellent examples, from general overview to step-by-step guide, on how to use every tools and technologies that BizTalk has to offer. Most importantly, the examples on how to use .NET (VB.Net/C#/) in developing COM+/COM/Web Sevices is very valuable. Not only they are valuable, all the examples I tried just worked which in itself saved me from frustrations!I must say that with this book, I clearly discovered many great capabilities of BizTalk and I am confident that I can accomplish anything that involves BizTalk using BizTalk Unleashed!By the way, the review just reflects my satisfaction of the book."
4,"Quick, ergonomic, non-electric chopping","My grandmother swore by one of these rocker-shaped knives for doing nuts and other fine chopping. I have one, and I use it a lot for mushrooms, nuts and herbs. Having said how great it is, I have to add some caveats:1. It's sharp, yeah, I know, duh! But...food gets caught between the two blades and it's tempting to run a finger in there to push it out. Well, don't. Keep a spatula or chopstick handy to push out anything caught there.2. You really should use a concave sort of chopping board if you can find one. While a flat plastic chopping board works just fine, a curved board makes chopping easier.3. Some things just aren't good for this knife: dryish but not TOO hard things (nuts, celery, etc) work best. The wetter the food, the more it sticks. Even so, I do use this for chopped chicken livers. But for nuts, it's about my favorite knife to use."
2,one blade is better,"Mezzalunas are great, but any w/ two blades are too tough to clean and get the minced items out from between the blades. My advice is to buy one of the many models w/ a single blade."
2,Misleading Ad,I thought those looking for a mezzaluna should know that this item IS NOT AS ADVERTISED. It measures only 5.5x4.5x1.0. It is 1/2 the advertised size.BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Well, it's decent, but there's more versatile designs.","It's good for mincing, and the form is a nice take on the half-moon design. However, an ulu would be better. It's single blade, but is good for slicing and shearing as well as mincing. This can only do mincing, due to it's handle design and blades.Personally, I prefer a tool with more function, like an ulu. Can't beat a design that's been used for thousands of years (for a good reason...)"
1,Sorry I bought this book,"I had to put 1 star because there is no -10 stars that I could put. This book is not what I expected, I'm wondering if this is a joke book instead of something that is supposed to be taken seriously. I am sorry I spent my time and money purchasing this book."
5,conversations with dog an uncommon dialogue of canine wisdom,Just finished reading this book and found it to be a teriffic guide to a better life. I now understand my own canine friend much better and relize that some of those thoughts that appear from nowhere are in fact coming from him. I look forward to more books from Kate and the animal kingdom.
2,To much writing,"The seller said like new. It didn't saw most pages written on in ink,with lines crossed out"
4,Nice book,This is a fine book containing many gorgeous pictures of John arranged in a chrono;ogical order.My only objection is the inclusion of a picture of John's murderer - it should not have found a place in a book celebrating Lennon's life.
2,Are we back in school?,"This book was highly reccomended to me by a dog trainer I called for help with my poodle. Well this book will be no help. It reads like a science text book and is really not designed for the ""common"" person. What a bummer, I was looking forward to learning from it."
4,Recommended,"it is definitely recommended! it works! simple and good ideas on very common situations. Hence, I recommend you to get one."
3,only dog - human guarding,"I haven't finished this book yet, and I probably won't, because it doesn't actually address the problem my dog has. This book is only aimed at improving resource guarding against humans. My dog guards from other dogs. Oh well..."
4,"Good book, fast delivery","This book is good if you have dogs that guard resources (toys, food, etc) from you or another person, but didn't help me with what I needed it for- our dog guards resources from our other dogs, but doesn't guard at all from us. Still, a very good book."
1,very unhappy with Amazon,"I have ordered my last from Amazon, due to the fact it is impossible tocontact them. In spite of what Amazon believes there is issues that doesnot fall in their format.Most companys have on their website a phone number or a contact us, notAmazon!!! I think this might be by design."
1,Merle Clamp,"The Merile Clamp is very well made except for one major part, the rewind system. Its hard to imagine how someone could put so much detail into a tool and then come up with the very poor design of getting the cable back into its retainer. The action of the spring spinning the flimsy handle could very easily hurt or break your finger. I used the clamp for the first time today and found the clamping ability to work very well, but the band retracing part has now broke. I can't understand why people are not complaining about the retracting of the band with this clamp. I am returning the Merle Clamp tomorrow."
4,Works nice,"Bought this clamp for picture frames. I do like the way it is made solid, but it takes a minute to get the hang of getting the strap around the piece you are working on. Works well when you do get it set up."
1,Pricey Lesson Builds New Habits,"After reviewing all 48 Psychobox cards, I consider that only 23% came close to meeting merchandiser claims: ""everything you need to delve into the psyche""; something to ""discover secrets, surprises, and amazements"" and ""a kaleidoscopic collection of psychological tests, . . ., and games."" The remaining 77% of the cards are mainly optical or perceptual illusions -- most entertaining for 1 or 2 uses.I am very, very disappointed and frustrated that there is no way to return the item (clever merchandising). I suppose Psychobox did help educate my psyche -- I have become a habitual user of the customer review service."
1,What games?,What a disappointment. There is only one card in this box that really qualifies as a 'game'. The rest is just op art and poorly explained junk.
2,Well protect but ...............,Do the job of protecting the ipod but in exchange your ipod will be like original Zune version due to the thickness added of the case.I threw out after 1 day trying.
5,Great Choice,"I have a Cannon SD 800IS and this case is perfect!!! It is very protective inside (soft & supportive) , it has actually two pouches inside and a nice zipper that contains it all. It has an additional strap for carrying and a place to cary it on your belt. I really like the belt option because you don't have to take off your belt to put it on. This also helps if you want to attach it to something else. The protective weather part is very discrete and hidden when not in use. All in all, this is a WONDERFUL case if you have a small digital camera!!!!"
1,DOES NOT WORK,This charger - though the number is the number of my phone - did not work - the jack to the phone is not the same. Not sure I can even get money back - probably not. I'll avoid buying accessories via Amazon in the future and buy direct from the OEM in the future.
3,I suspect too much praise,"The style of writing is disjointed. The co-author Barbara Forrest is an philosophy professor and mid-way through the book one can tell when she takes over because the writing style becomes smooth and reasoned.... an a philosophy professor would be expected to write. It's like night and day. The first half of the book is rough (in terms of the writing style) and almost painful to read. It's a very long rant, filled with obvious passion. I suspect that the co-author, Paul R. Gross, wrote it in one long burst and then ran out of steam. It was odd.I will leave the content for others to evaluate but I found the book difficult to read and the first part was unpersuasive unless one came to the subject already persuaded. Once one waded through those first 140 pages or so, the book evened out and began making reasoned, dispassionate arguments which is what I prefer. There is enough heat on this subject. I prefer light.Alex"
3,Informative but not a page turner,"Even though I appreciate the real effort made by the authors to expose the real motives behind the wedge, the book just didn't resonated with me. I had a lot of problems to continue reading, it just didn't hook me."
1,Conspiracy theory hysteria,"The better the book, the longer my review. This will be a short review. I have two problems with Forrest and Gross' work. First, as is common in conspiracy theory writings, it commits the fallacy of the neglected aspect; it builds its case on very carefully selected evidence that supports the authors' belief. The result is a gross misrepresentation of the true state of affairs (the second problem). Unfortunately, this type of hysteria/urban myth plays to the popular audience who keep the newspaper tabloids in business. If one is truly interested in what intelligent design scientists actually propose, one will be much better off reading what they actually say. In my opinion, William Dembski's No Free Lunch would be a good start."
5,A Valuable Service,"Forrest and Gross have done the country a valuable service by documenting the political and ideological foundations of the intelligent design movement. Anyone who still believes that movement is primarily, or even partly, a scientific endeavour need only search PNAS, BIOMED, BIOSIS, and the like for published research on intelligent design creationism in biology. There is none to be found. The ID movement's ""scientists"" publish no ID science.What, then, has all the fuss in Kansas, Ohio, Texas, New Mexico, West Virginia, and so on been about? Not science, for sure. Forrest and Gross describe with rich documentation just what is driving the intelligent design movement in spite of its scientific sterility."
2,Very disappointing,This book was advertised as a comprehensive history of the monarchy. I found it sadly lacking in detail of any sort. It was more of a synopsis of the monarchy. I was very disappointed and can only recommend it to those who want just a cursory review of the kings and queens of Great Britain.
5,Fighting for Honor,This is an excellent book. It gives a good perspective of some of what the Japanese Americans experienced during World War II while living in America. The perspective is from many sides. Well written.
4,"Great, but outdated","I've really gotten a lot out of this book, and I would highly recommend it, except for the fact that it came out in 2002 and only covers 10.1 (with an appendix entry discussing the new features in the ""up-coming 10.2""). Many of the methods documented here have been long since ""deprecated.""If you can find this book at a reasonable price, it would pair well with a more current book. I found it contained valuable information not present in some of the more recent books.If this guy ever releases an updated version of this book, I would buy it in a Nano-second (a little iPod humour there)(Yeah, very little)."
2,"negligent, inexact, erroneous...","this book is amazing, amazing how many mistakes and spelling errors it has. the publisher should ashamed. very sloppy work."
4,ice for mini me!,This is a great and very simple ice bucket. Do away with all the fancy features of the modern ice bucket! Return to the simple times when an ice bucket was an ice bucket. My only complaint is that this bucket is SMALL! 32oz really isnt that much ice. I'd say its good for about 4 drinks... which ought to do!
4,"Durable, easy to use","This ice bucket is very small, so don't buy this if you are looking for something for a big party of people. I mainly pull this out when I have like two or three people over because it is the perfect size for that. It is approximately six inches high/deep and easily fits on narrow shelves for easy storage. I would recommend storing it in the box because this little bugger otherwise seems to attract dust and when stored in the box the finish stays nicer. But good for small parties and intimate gatherings and especially good if you have small kids - the stainless steel will forgive a lot of wear."
4,For Friday Cocktails,"If you like your Friday cocktail, and enjoy having people over to enjoy it with you, then get an ice bucket and some tongs. I purchased this one when my old one rusted out and like it much better. It's just classy enough, without seeming snooty, and holds a nice amount of ice. Just fill it, stick it on your bar or table, and then you don't have to worry about continually opening up the freezer."
3,quite small,"I was surprised at how small this bucket is. To me, ""32-ounce size"" doesn't really describe the actual size. Also it is not insulated or double walled as ice buckets usually are and has no lid to keep the ice frozen - but the quality is top notch."
3,"Mini, but useful",I ordered two of these ice buckets for a recent party I was hosting. When they came I was surprised how small they were - and learned my lesson to look closely at the dimensions before I buy.
3,Read the fine print!,"This is a cute, LITTLE ice bucket with the emphasis on LITTLE.This is not a regular sized ice bucket, however it will hold enough ice for a small gathering. It looks nice too."
3,"Good tape, buy 63 minute version instead","These are great tapes for filming in HD on Sony camcorders (I use an HDR-HC3).However:The 85 minute HD tape is more expensive per minute than the 63 minute version. So until the price gets lowered to below 14 dollars a tape, you're just paying more for less tape. The only exception is if you have to film something for longer than 63 minutes (but less than 85) straight without ever changing tapes.Just remember, you get 6.3 minutes of tape per dollar with the 63 minute tapes (because they cost around 10 dollars a tape)."
1,Does it work?,"We bought this clock thinking it would automatically change time when you entered different time zones, but on our trip to Europe, the clock never left California time. I paid about $30 for this thinking it would be a great help on our trip, but it didn't do what it said it would do."
2,Worked great...3 times,"The egg poacher worked great the first three times I used it, then it quit working. Now, it is just a bulky toaster. My recommendation is -1. IF you want a toaster, buy a toaster.2. If you want a poacher, buy a poacher.3. If you want a combination unit, buy something else."
1,Great Little Toaster - Update,"What a great little toaster. Does exactly what it claims. Makes the toast, cooks the egg and meat, and a great little sandwich to start the day. Wonderful item.Update: The egg cooking portion of this toaster only worked for about 2 months with only occasional use. I have a friend who bought the same unit and had exactly the same problem. If this had continued to work, I would have given this unit the top rating, but since it broke so quickly, I cannot recommend it"
2,great while it lasted,this was the best toaster ever for my family quick easy egg mc muffins until 3 months later egg cooker quit working a short while after that the toaster quit working great idea not so great product.
5,Great little appliance!,"Just received this from Amazon yesterday. Made Egg/Sausage/Muffin Sandwiches for breakfast this morning. It worked like a dream! Sure beats doing it all on the range top! Egg was perfectly cooked, sausage was steaming hot, muffin was crisp and ready to slather with butter. Yum! Yes, it is one of those appliances that doesn't do much, but what it does, it does very well! Glad I bought it."
3,Egg pan hard to clean,"This little appliance works great. I use it 1-2 times a week to make sandwiches and just about everyday to make toast. My only complaint is that the pan that comes with it is very hard to clean. ""Paula"" is embossed in the bottom of the pan, so anything that sticks inside any of the letters is hard to get at. It is not ""nonstick""...everything sticks (in my experience) unless you use a lot of oil, which defeats the purpose of not frying an egg in butter/oil on the stovetop.Egg sticks to the sides and bottom of the pan (but mostly in the ""P"" of ""Paula"". I've actually started using a metal pan that came with my kids' play kitchen instead of the pan that came with this toaster.BUT it does make great sandwiches and toasts pretty evenly."
2,"Great idea, lousy product","I loved the idea of making egg and toast at the same time using same equipment. kudos.The product worked great for a while but in few months the egg maker was dead. The frustrating part is that I didnt even use the unit everyday.I went ahead with giving it another try thinking that the first one might had been a faulty production item. Again few months later, egg maker is dead.I wish some other company would take the same idea and design a better, durable product."
2,Not even heating element,The toaster part of the heating element is not balance/even.The toast comes out one side darker than the other.
2,DONT WASTE MONEY,"i RECEIVED AS A GIFT AND THE POACHING PAN CHIPPED AFTER ABOUT 1 YR AND NOW THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT FOR THE PAN ONLY THING GOOD FOR IS TOAST AND HARD BOILED EGGS (WHICH i DONT LIKE),DID FIND 1 PLACE TO GET PAN BUT SHIPPING WAS RIDICULOUS WOULD OF COST ME 16.00"
1,no yoke,"I have purchased both toasters White and Black) The first one stopped working after about 7mos. I then bought a second one, after 6mos it only makes toast.From now on I go to McDonalds for the egg/muffin."
4,High Style and Functionality,"Nice stlye and design add to the appeal of this easy to use appliance. Quick clean up after poaching eggs is a bonus, and you can also cook 4 soft/hard boiled eggs with no fuss - or additional pots. Ready made breakfast sandwiches come out moist and hot - just pop them into the poaching tray! Great new toy would make a very cool gift!"
5,THE VIEW,"BEING A FAN OF ""BONES THUGS AND HARMONY"", I BASICALLY LIKE ANYTHING THEY PUT OUT. BUT THIS IS NOT A MOVIE DESIGNED FOR ALL EARS."
5,Great Movie!,"The movie delivers a good look into what could of happened with Krayzie, Layzie & Wish Bone if they would of never met Eazy-E. Worth buying if your a Bone Thugs-N-Harmony fan! Only thing I didn't like was that of course Bizzy Bone wasn't in the movie, but other then that a real great movie! Don't sleep on it."
4,Great teaching resource,"One of my high school social studies teachers asked the library to buy this after seeing it on TV. She was impressed. We are an all-girls college prep school. So, finding things to promote women is important to our curriculum. We also use IRON JAWED ANGELS (fight for women sufferage) in our classes."
1,I couldn't believe the pennies were not copper.,"Don't waste your money on this toy. The kids were disappointed when they tried real pennies to replace the ""fake pennies"" that got lost."
5,Fender Original Bullets (3150 SL) Pure Nickel Bullet End Guitar Strings,"these are the best strings i have ever played on until now, I am waiting to compare it with Ernie ball strings. what i like about pure nickel strings is that they are so soft and have a warm tone, it's really amazing, i think i bought 3 boxes of them, i bought nickel wound strings by dean Marley, D,addario and Ernie ballall in the same gauge but still i didn't feel pleased like with pure nickel strings."
5,A Very Unique and Beautiful Work,"I guess the title for my review says it all. Steve Green has taken his art to a whole different level with this heart-moving album. From the very first song, there is an eerily beautiful melodious feeling to the music. I have never quite heard Christian music like this before and I hope that he is able to continue along this line in forthcoming works. There is almost a ""Phantom of the Opera...but Christian"" feel to it. Steve sings from his heart on this one and I recommend it with 5 stars!"
3,Somewhere Between,"Somewhere BetweenThis album did not inspire me like the other I have purchased. (I own nearly all non-holiday albums made by this artist.) It is good, but not as moving as some of the earlier albums."
4,Listen to Rez to break out of your comfort zone.,"Rez is nearly ALWAYS great. Totally passionate vocals by Wendy and Glenn Kaiser, thoughtful, realistic lyrics, variety in sound, and some of most vicious guitar playing anywhere (and most defintiely in Christian arena rock) by Glenn Kaiser and Stu Heiss. Opener ""Heart's Desire,"" a song of devotion, features a most yearning chorus, ""If Your Love Grows Cold,"" a great power chorded opening. Returning vet's plight, searching for self, futileness of this life, and the need for love and self worth are some of the subjects that Rez always seem to be in touch with. If you want to break out of your comfort zone, listen to any Rez music, but Reach of Love especially."
1,hard to clean & reassemble,"The lid has to be taken completely apart to clean, 4 pieces total. Ok, I can deal with that. You have to snap it back together carefully and as close to perfectly as you can get, or it leaks. Even if you get it back and it doesn't leak around the sippy, once it's used, it leaks around that little air hole for venting. I pour out any milk left over immediately, so it doesn't sit. Soaks in detergent and hot water, then washed in the dishwasher. Smells sour, the silicone ring around the underside of the rim is basically impossible to clean. It's nasty smelling. We don't use it anymore. If there's a sour smell, there must be bacteria?!! What a disappointment."
1,"Leaks all over, everytime. $20 rip off.","I was so excited to buy this product from thermos, thinking that it would be totally worth how expensive the sippy cup is. And with everything going on with the plastic chemical in baby products, I was thrilled when I found this. I wouldnt recommend this product to anyone, for the fact that it is advertised as LEAK-PROOF and leaks more than any other sippy I have tried. It is awful. It is like they never even tested this product.I would recommend Avent Organic sippys, you can find them at Whole Foods as well as the internet. TOTALLY DISAPOINTED AND RIPPED OFF.Almost $20 for one sippy! And I purchased 2."
2,Leaking Sippy,"If you want an insulated sippy that leaks when upside down, you should buy this sippy."
3,Not leak proof,"You have to get the spout lined up JUST RIGHT or you will have problems with leaking.Also - if you fill it up full, it will leak.But I love that it's stainless steel instead of having to worry about it being plastic and all the chemicals that come along with that."
1,Leaks!,I was skeptical when reading other reviews about this cup leaking. I ordered it anyway. This cup leaks all over the place! Trust me and save your time and money. I read the directions and took the time to make sure the seal was assembled correctly. Guess what? It still leaked. Leaks out the vent hole and around the mouth piece. I am sending these back today.
1,Expensive and leaky!,"The idea of keeping beverages in an insulated mug is great. The idea of beverages leaking all over the bottom of a purse or bag, not so great.It's very important that a sippy cup can be placed in a purse or diaper bag without leaking. It is not possible to do this with the Froogo sippy cup. It leaks all over. Almost every other brand of sippy cups come with a plastic lid cover or a disk that can be inserted inside the cup. Not so with Froogo.I've contacted Thermos, but they have yet to respond to my email.Don't waste your money!!"
3,No leak!,"I bought both the Foogo straw cup and this sippy cup. While the straw cup leaked continuously when tilted without the cap on, this sippy cup does not leak when tilted upside down!The spout is relatively soft although not as soft as the spouts on the Nuby cups/bottles. The valve took some effort to remove for cleaning as there is an additional valve plate over the valve and the plastic pull is tough to grasp even with small fingers. However, it is doable and I may get better at pulling it just the right way.This would a 5-star product if it had an easier valve set-up for cleaning and a cap to protect the spout from dirt when the kids drop it."
1,mildew problem,We were glad to see a stainless product for our LO so we weren't shy to pay the extra bucks. What we didn't expect is that the soft yellow plastic would build up mildew even when the cup is exclusively used for water. I have tried everything short of bleach soaking to get the mildew out (we aren't sure of the byproducts of soaking in bleach-outweighs the benefits of the stainless?). We even have a nursery sterilizer that doesn't put a dent in the mildew...All I can say is YUK!
2,Some bad advice,"The first part of the video, examining some new careers like Space Lawyer and Green Architect is very interesting. The problem is that interviewee Marty Nemko gives some really bad advice. For example, he suggests that you should ask about salary in the first job interview. Um...no. One, you should already have some idea of at least a salary range, had you already researched the company as he suggests. Second, you run the grave risk of being percieved as ONLY being interested in the $$$$ (I've been a recruiter for over six years, and I've had a number of clients agree with me on this). Basically, take any of this advice in this video with a rather large grain of salt."
5,"An insightful balm to an aching, wondering heart.","I have treasured this wonderfully frank and insightful book. How tragic its concept, yet how much comfort and support it has given me and several of my dear friends who have also experienced the death of a child. As we journey over the often-times, bumpy trail that is life, we may feel alone in our circumstances and this book enables us to feel a closeness and a shared strength with those who are also travelling along this path."
5,Most helpful!,I received this book from a close family friend after the death of my infant son. It helped me understand the feelings I was having and some of what my husband was going thorugh as well. Great LDS perspective of what happens to a child after this life! I always have an extra copy on hand to pass to other parents who have suffered the loss of a child. Highly recommend this book!
5,Kuryakyn floor board kit,fast shipping....very nice chrome..........easy to install.....very smooth shifting ............kuryakyn makes some nice stuff and this floor board kit is no exception
5,Profound. Simple. Human.,"This book is very aptly titled. The poems feel like waking up in a pile of cinders that used to be a house. Not sad really. Just sort of empty. As if everything has been reduced to stark facts with a few flowers sprouting here and there out of the ashes. There is something profoundly touching about these poems. They do an amazing job of conveying the spent feeling after the huge emotional turmoil of losing a parent. One line from the book that runs through my head sometimes: ""After a pause, she says--he hears her say--'I love you like salt.'"""
3,Not Atwood's best poetry.,"While it's always cheering to find literary poetry on the bestseller list, this seems to have made the (Canadian)bestseller lists merely because of the author's name. It's not *bad* poetry, just not great, and Atwood at this late stage is forcing the humour: she's funny in her novels without being coy or whimsical, which she does to excess in this collection. Maybe it was an off-year for Atwood as poet--she's currently stronger as a novelist, in a reversal of her early career. This book is not representative of Atwood's best poetry; unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to find Atwood's best poetry in the United States"
3,good,it is really good not what i was expecting but really good but remember products do not work the same for everybody
4,Above average guitar-driven melodic alt-rock,"Just over ten year ago, I heard the single ""Sell Me"" on an alternative radio station. While sounding a lot like the Foo Fighters, which I liked, it wasn't enough for me to buy the CD. A couple of months ago, I happened to listen to some of the song samples from this CD on Amazon and noticed it was on sale for a penny, so I figured, what the heck, I'd buy it. After listening to the CD a few times I can say I'm glad I bought it. It is not among my top ten desert island discs, and I don't listen to it all the time, but it is definitely above average. If you like the early Foo Fighters, Cheerleadr, or American Hi-Fi, you'll probably like this CD."
5,Frankie Machine...Not just Frank Sinatra on heroin anymore!!!,"Frankie Machine was the catalyst for the overthrowing of Egypt's government. Ryan Martin spills his guts out on this one. The drums were molested by Gary ""Who farted?"" Benson. Riley ""Effin'"" Baxter stands on the bass with the vengence of a mutant from another world. There was another guy in the band, but I can't recall his name. This album is the thing that dreams are made of. The album was called ""One"". I always wondered if the next album would have been called ""Two"". Seriously though, this is a very good hard rocking cd. Buy it."
3,Pretty Good,"Pretty good book. If you have limited time to read, this book is perfect for you. Short chapters with information we already know but a great refresher course to mentally help prepare us in our journey to a healthier body."
3,"Think Thin, Be Thin","Seems possible to lose weight through changing your mindset. I am only a few days into the book and program, but I am confident the changes will happen....we'll see!"
5,Lose it forever,"I like this book's new approach to weight control. Think Thin, Be Thin stands out from all the other diet books because it emphasizes techniques to keep the pounds off after you lose them. In the past, I have lost weight on various diets, but I always gained it back. This book shows how to use your brain to lose weight and then break the cycle of losing and gaining."
5,The sun burner's BEST friend.,"I am one of those women who never tans. We just burn. Then I found Colorecience SUNFORGETTABLE. My husband and I recently walked the streets of Salt Lake City in the bright, bright, 100 degree sunshine, wearing SUNFORGETTABLE. I did not even turn pink. The mineral powder is so translucent, no one can else knows you are wearing it, but your skin will know it and thank you!!! I am, at last, able to enjoy the sun without the sticky feel of a cream sunblock and without fear of sun burn. Thank you Colorescience."
5,Very impressive debut!,"I read this book on a cross-country flight and literally couldn't put it down! A fast-paced read with enough twists to keep me guessing. I'm definitely recommending it, and am looking forward to the next one!"
3,not bad,"The sheet is very soft, however it does not fit very well. It's a bit too big and the elastic is not strong enough to hold the sheet in place."
2,Kinda sorta works...,"I used this on some antique curtain rods with various layers of rust. I coated on a layer, waited 10 minutes, then rinsed. On the lighter rust, it got most of the rust off, but not all. So I put on another layer, waited 10 minutes, checked it, nothing, put on more, waited 45 more minutes, then rinsed. A little more rust came off but not enough to be impressed. I did this 5 more times and it just seemed to stop working. So, if you have very light rust problems, this may work. Anything above that, you may want to try something else."
2,Waste of time and money,"""Ideal for heavily rusted items"" is a misleading statement. It is mild acid jelly good for very light rust only. Three applications was not enough to remove 2 days rust from ski edges."
4,Naval Jelly,"This product has done what is says it will. We use it to clean the rust line in the toilet bowls. Brush a coating on the area, let it set for a while and wipe off. Sometime a scotch pad is needed for the tough areas."
2,Works on slightly tarnished but not rusted copper,"I purchased this to help with restoring a tube amplifier that has rust spots and heavy tarnish on the chassis. I used the product as specified leaving it on anywhere from 5-15 mins and retrying but it doesn't seem to do much with rust. This is after I have sanded most of the rust off already. It did work for slightly tarnished copper on other parts of the chassis, but that's about it. Not sure if I'm doing something wrong but this did not meet my expectations. I did not expect this to perform miracles but did expect it to make some improvement to rusted parts, well it didn't."
2,Keep looking,This sweater is cute but the neck stretches out quickly so your dog ends up wearing a skirt. I'd keep looking if I were you. Or you can do what I ended up doing. I whipstitched up the stretched-out neck about an inch. So far it seems to stay on better but it's not an ideal look or situation.
3,At this price!,"As advertised, these appear to be very sharp and durable knives. At this price you just cannot go wrong. The edges are slightly serrated. They cut salame, tomatoes, etc. equally well. I have thrown a number of other knives away, since these are such a higher quality knife. Nothing is perfect - the knife is thinner metal than I expected and with sufficient pressure, it bends when cutting. But for most cutting needs, this is no problem."
3,"yes they do need sharpening,,,",I've had these knives for a few years now. The handles broke and the blades are dull. :(
5,funny,"I bought this as a gift for my dad, but I remember it from when I was a kid and it was a riot. I remember hearing my dad laugh so loud at it."
3,"Great show, horrible production","It's great to see McHale and his band of merry men again. Shout! Factory, however, really did a poor job on the transfers. The sound is horrendously bad and out of synch with the characters' lips most of the time. Almost like they created the DVD video using second-rate software. The picture quality is good, with a few errors here and there over the discs that shows up as pixelated blockiness. The best picture in the world can't make up for the botched audio, though, and it's very hard to concentrate on the show itself when the audio is so badly out of synch. Throw in the incessant commercials at the beginning of the discs that you can't skip or fast-forward over and you've got your below-average DVD set that is not a complete joy to own, which it should be. If you really love McHale's Navy then it's something you probably want to have. It's a shame I feel as though I had to settle for this Shout! Factory hack job."
2,Won't buy any more Sharp Factory products.,"The only thing I hate worse than commercials is having to pay for them. This company Shout Factory puts commercials at the beginning of the disc like most, but you cannot forward past them. Maybe one commercial would be ok, but there are several minutes of them. I buy movies and shows to get away from these. REALLY disappointed in this company. Once you get past the commercials, the video quality is ok, not great but ok.. But every time you start the disc, you have to watch the lame commercials again. As a kid, McHale's Navy was one of my favorites, and still is, just a shame what Shout has done to them for a little more profit. Takes a little of the fun out of the shows."
1,avoid at all costs,"I don't own this recording but, just from listening to the samples, I can safely say, there is no amount of money you could pay me to convince me to buy it."
2,Too preliminary (and lacks technical depth) ...,"If you're not a technologist, and want to ""read"" about data mining or at best get aware of what are the various technologies and products in the field, then maybe this might suffice. But if you're a hands on developer or a technology manager trying to learn data mining techniques to apply to your web systems, I'd advise you pass on this book (unfortunately, though, I don't have another one to recommend -- other than reading white papers and research reviews from some of the leading vendors of data mining products)."
1,not impressed,"This book contains case studies from various data mining software. It does not contain any specific theory or practical examples for implementing a web analytics strategy for your site.90% of the case studies he uses in his book are related to companies which their sites no longer exist.I find this book very outdated and the examples the author use are related to visits on site, their age and country of origin. He doesn't mention anything about visitor site navigiation, trends or anything related to the visitor behaviour on site.I wish i never bought this book because it costed me $80 due to courrier fees."
4,As expected - Great product,"The ZBT is the lowest class of Zildjian cymbals, but I was quite surprised how this cymbal performed. It's a ride/crash and sounds great for both uses."
1,Terrible quality and sound,"I have been playing drums for 28 years now. Started with Zildjian back in the day and then went to Sabian and Paiste. I started jamming for fun again with some locals who have a set at their practice space,I didn't want to leave good cymbals so I picked up used this 18"" and a 16"" ZBT, as well as a 18"" Paiste 303 crash. The ZBT's are the worst sounding cymbals I have EVER played. Trash can and broken glass style sound.. Shame on Zildjian.. Go Sabian B8,Meinhl,or Paiste 303 if you want to go cheap, as least they sound like cymbals."
5,Excellent..........,"I've been a fan of Ricardo Castillon since he started.Had the pleasure of meeting him and his band through some mutual friends. No matter what he writes or sings I will always love his music. This CD is great, love all the songs and I will forever continue to listen to his music.Hope to see him soon in San Antonio again."
3,False Advertising,"I bought this drive from my local CompUSA for two reasons: I needed to backup my files, and I thought it would be cool to watch DVD movies on my Mac. The software for the DVD player was supposed to be included, right?? Wrong. Iomega does not offer software for the DVD player, but they didn't bother to say this on the box.Here is the software compatibility list that I found in the user manual:Iomega HotBurn Pro (PC users)Charismac Discribe (Mac users)Iomega Automatic Backup (PC only)Sonic CinePlayer (PC only)MusicMatch Jukebox (PC/Mac)Adobe PhotoShop Album SE (PC only)I'm giving this drive a 3-star rating because my experience with the CD-burner was great. The software installation was a snap, and it took about a minute to burn 350MB on a CD.Even though I accomplished my original goal, I would not recommend this product to Mac users. In fact, I wish I had checked on Amazon before I did."
3,NOT What It Says ???,"Bought this for a friend in US:While it says Iomega on the box, but is, in fact a lite-on, according to Nero.I have NEVER had a decent lite-on burner yet!!!!!!(Three stars given, as i couldnt leave blank)"
4,Interesting viewing,"This make interesting, if sometimes uncomfortable viewing. It spans the years introducing you to different systems and regimes in which the rise of white, educated and 'normal' people were the basis of some countries idealistic views to a propsperous and powerful future. This is not just about Hitler and Germany, but delves before this time, where perhaps surprisingly it uncovers that it was not just the Germans who had the view that 'white supremacy' was the way forward. Needs to be viewed with an open mind and looked at with a view to the 'bigger picture' that these people were attempting to obtain."
4,"Bel Canto, indeed","I became interested in this album after hearing a recording of Ms. Horne singing ""Superbo di me stesso"" on another album - her rendition here makes me tired just hearing it! This album is a live recording with piano only, but I found it to be a nice mix of music and of generally high quality. Her rendition of ""He's Gone Away"" is quite moving. Any fan of Ms. Horne's would be advised to purchase this recording."
1,Not a complete description given,First disappointment - you have to have 3 or more to play. Just 2 in our household. That was not indicated in the Amazon description. Rules were confusing. There isn't even a board to the Anarchy Board Game. Ended up shelving it. Have to give 1 star to packaging and the cool shape of the cards. But I could get that at a Dollar Store.
4,extra protection vs 3 year old !,My friends kid is always throwing the controllers around and it makes me cringe(I am A semi-avid gamer) so I bought 2 of these for her! She loves them.I have them for my x box 360 and like the protection against the occasional dropsies and I enjoy the grip.
4,Great skin!,Great silicone skin! I bought this to eliminate my sweaty hand syndrome while playing FPSs and it does the job and it also keeps the controller from sliding off of table tops so easily.
2,You don't get whats in the picture..,"I got this and assumed I was going to get the one in the picture but I received a different one. It seemed and felt like it would rip around where the control sticks would be and if you get this for fps shooters, the silicone around the control sticks gets in the way and feels odd. I was going to return this item but I would be spending more than I spent. I hope this review helped."
3,it was ok did what it was suppose to,"Its just a skin there aint ntn bad or extremely great about it but I guess you could say that it did wat was expected of it, its great for persons with sweaty hands"
2,Very bad!,"The silicone grip case comes off very quickly and is not strong. Worst silicone case out there, very disappointed in this product!"
2,Indifferent,More slippery than just the controller itself. Kind of a weird rubber material. I'd recommend something else if you're looking for a skin that is easy to hold onto.
5,Monster Energy,"My roommate ordered these so i decided to try them out. I took them 20 minutes before because he had taken them earlier that day. during the workout, i felt an increase in energy and was able to push more weight. After the workout, however, i felt like i was on crack (figuratively speaking of course). I was bouncing off the walls. Had I taken them during the time indicated on the bottle (30 minutes to an hour prior to the workout) I would have felt awesome. I would recommend them to anybody looking for an energy boost.about me (for comparison purposes)5'10""160 lbslast time i worked out was about 3-4 months agoplayed hockey through highschool so rather athletic"
1,garbage,this stuff is junk and dont forget to tell people if you have prostate problums you could end up with a cathader....rrrrrrrr
4,Great pump but beware.,I've been using this N.O. product for a couple weeks and I've just recently started experiencing what other reviews have talked about. I started getting red rashes on my arms. My neck turns super red along with my ears. This is temporary tho. Usually starts 30 mins after I take them then goes away after about 15 minutes. Overall solid pumps just beware of the after effects.
3,first day in using it,"i feels good, i got a great pumped feeling,if i take too long to work out i start to feel a heat around my neck area that kinda stings but if i go work out exactly 30 minutes after i drink it its all good...saw some veins popping out today i never saw those before while working out..after a few weeks il give a next comment"
2,Nothin Really,"I tried it a couple times, uhh dont really feel anything. I went from maxing 195 to 200 but that coulda just been natural. I'm only 14 so it could make a difference to somebody who was older and had more expp."
1,Gargage,"My wife bought me this and I am really embarassed for both of us because it did nothing to help and just drained are savings.I tried the full bottle, followed the directions, and it just did not help at all.I was not able to get a refund either."
2,NO Monster,I have been taking Nitric Oxide for about a year. I have tried several different products to see which would work the best for me. I was very disappointed in N.O. Monster. I won't be re-ordering it.
2,havent noticed a thing,have yet to notice anything 2nd day today and i took the serving size and didnt notice any difference or anything will try it again and see what happens if it does what it says ill delete this reveiw and leave a better one
2,Not that great,I saw all the reviews that this stuff is amazing and will give you a huge pump so I was excited to try it. Took the pills about 45 minutes before my workout and I felt relatively nothing..maybe a small pump. Since then I havent seen any better results
1,how do you contact Goliath Labs for active ingredients,How do I get a hold of the company to find out what is the ingredients in this product because I think everyone should know what is in a product before they take it. More detail should be added to this product because for those of us that take supplements we need to kwow what's inside so we protect ourselves.
1,DO NOT GET THIS ITEM!!!,I dont ever write review but i am going to for this!! this is a horrible item!! all the review you read about having red skin and feeling itchy are real. geez i real like i got totally smashed up just now.. your throat starts to get all swelled up and you start to feel dizzy!! you are not going to get muscles just by taking this!!
5,N.O. Monster,This stuff gave me the craziest workout out of any produst ive used. hot flash and red skin but cleared up after about 15 min. other than that its a must buy!
5,Very powerful; Recommend reducing the dose.,"I rated this product five stars because it gives me more pump and energy than any other supplement i've ever taken. (N.O. explode, fireballs, caffeine, Muscle Tech's N.O. Vapor). However, when I take the recommended dosage of 4 pills, I get a bit dizzy and a headache. Since I switched to 2 pills (half a dose), I have noticed no adverse side effects, and have substantially increased vascularity and strength. 4 pills is probably only necessary for true bodybuilders/athletes (220 lbs plus) carrying a lot of muscle weight. So I recommend taking 2 pills and upping it to 3 the next time if it wasn't enough."
4,Updated Review,"This product works. Period. When I take the capsules I get a lot of energy for workouts. I easily do more than I would without. I've been taking 4 capsules 30-35 minutes before working and it works great. I've been noticing some results, and I'm feeling great. Not really any side effects, but you do have to drink a lot of water, which makes you pee a lot. But overall, a GREAT product!"
1,Don't Try This.,"I cant recommend this product. i took the recommended dosage and after 15mins with it, heat and scratching all over my body to the point i'm almost want to puke. i have a taken N.O.2 before and this is the worst supplement i ever take."
2,not for me,"I've been workin on my physical fitness for 2 years now. 6 months ago a buddy of mine suggested i try jack3d. i did and it was amazing. once i ran out I did my homework and decided I wanted something alittle less synthetic. after reading the reviews of N.O.M I thought ""perrrfect"" but no. i did nothing for me. other than the niasin that made me temporaily break out in a rash. not hating just didnt work for me. not the ""rush"" i had grown so fond of with jack3d. plus u have to take 4 horse pills aday. i personally just wound up opening them and poorin em in to my shake bottle."
5,"Perfect ! Gorgeous, Elegant, worth the price !","After a long search for a durable, elegant and A+ quality product we bought a Hafnia set and we are more than pleased: very impressed. Sturdy but simply gorgeous, very comfortable to handle. The shine is absolutely stunning even that is brushed stainless. Perfect ! But the description of the aditional pieces as a Serving Set is wrong: they are not a TABLESPOON and a COLD MEAT FORK, the extra pieces are a LARGE SERVE SPOON and LARGE SERVE FORK (same as two of the pieces of the Entertainment Set). Be aware when you get this set it comes with this two wonderful LARGE SERVE SPOON AND FORK, perfect for salads. I have to return the Entertainment Set i bought together with the 42 piece Set because the description of the 42pcs set was wrong about the extra pieces. But i highly recommend Yamazaki Hafnia 42 piece set, that also comes with the wood box, flawless. About the price: Amazon.com have the best deal. Thank you !"
2,A bit expensive for what you get.,"This was just a plastic tray with some holes in it to pour the plaster of paris into. It came with some paint and a paintbrush, but really there is not much to this kit. The book that came with it did not really seem to go with the fossils that we made."
2,A Big Disappointment,I bought this thinking it had somewhat durable molds to make plaster casts of fossils. The molds are cheap plastic and though it did make a decent cast it wasn't worth the money in my opinion.
3,giggle as you go,"Bought this for a man who has everything. Thought it would be a great birthday laugh. Everyone loved it, wanted to know where I purchased it. He set up in the ""library"" and I have not seen him since."
4,A mixed blessing,"With so few June Anderson recordings available these days, sometimes we must settle for what we can get. The quality of this live recording is not the highest, but in no way inhibits enjoyment of the recording. Until someone releases a full Anderson recording of Lucia (I'm sure there's one locked up somewhere), we can enjoy the magnificent selection included here. Also first rate is her Sonnambula scene. Her rendering of the Traviata scene, however, is tarnished by the squawking of the completely outclassed tenor. Also, her Semiramide aria is better (and uncut) on her live Paris concert recording with Alfredo Kraus."
1,Overrated Drivel,"I find it interesting that such a supposedly important and relevant contemporary work has only been reviewed by 11 people at the time of this writing. That alone tells you all you need to know since this is a book that is classed under both Latino and Women's Studies, and is part of many university literary programs.The book is pretentious claptrap of the worst kind. If this book were judged on its merits rather than by popular, politically correct notions, it wouldn't come close to making the cut.Alas, academia has embraced the book as a great work, and so it is required reading for an English M.A. program at a major university that I was accepted into. An English M.A.! Once I saw that this book was part of the program, I didn't even bother registering.I don't mind rants against social, cultural and economic injustices. I've read many. But Ms. Anzaldua is no James Baldwin, that's for sure."
5,Borderlands/La Frontera's Philosophical import,"Other reviewers have covered many of the qualities of the work, so I want to dwell on just one point - don't be fooled into thinking that this work is useful only as a personal study on Anzaldua's cultural/gender/queer theory.Anzaldua is of high importance to any philosophy of the social; within her writing you can find the key insights of figures such as Derrida and Nietzsche, as they relate to personal identity crafted out of a fractured heritage. Her point is that we are ALL borderlanders given that the human condition involves being stretched across a chasm of self-alterity. Only through a full recognition of this can a critical inventory of the self be undertaken, which is a prerequisite to responsibility and genuine care of the self."
4,Good stuff!!,"I heard this compilation at a friend's house a few weeks before and decided that I had to have it. This is not my first Monty Alexander compilation, so again I'm not disappointed. A collector's item indeed!!!"
1,Its Fashionable to To Praise Non-Thought!,It could only have come in a context such as the 1990's neo-liberal America that non-thinking could be praised and even become fashionable. Derrida to tough to read? Make fun of him! Deleuze's philosophy too non-analytic for you? Make fun of it! Jacques Lacan getting too personal with his appreciation of the psyche? Denounce it as rubbish! You'll have an instant best-seller on your hands and a multitude of people who hate thinking here to cheer you on! Hooooo-ray!!!
1,I really really dislike this book,"This is one of my least favorite development books ever. After only a short time with it I have already given it ""Place on a shelf never to open again"" status.I somewhat prefer js over vb. However, to create an asp book that is purely dedicated to vb and not to list that on the cover is shameful. Since the person writing it seems to be tied into Microsoft I am guessing it is another MS attempt to push vb.The vb issue aside, I still completely hate this book. I found the little bit of actual asp in the Dreamweaver Ultradev Bible (another great ""bible"" series book) far more intuative and instructive that the junk in this book.Note: I have looked at probably hundreds of development books over the last few years and I have never trashed a book online before. That is how much I dislike this book!"
3,"Good, but not great","I am a SQL Server DBA and I have quite a bit of SQL and VB experience. This is a good book to learn ASP if you are an absolute beginner. The code snippets are explained line by line. While this may be good for a total beginner I found it annoying after a while. I would expect this more in a ""Dummies"" book.Also, there are WAY TOO MANY screen shots that take up a lot of real estate on the page. I think this is more filler than anything else to boost the page count. Greg Buczek (and most other tech authors) need to take lessons in brevity and clarity from author Ken Henderson, IMHO the best tech author on the planet! (see The Gurus Guide to Transact-SQL).If not for all the screen shots I would have given this book 4 stars.Despite this it was still a good resource to learn ASP once you wade through all the fluff and screen shots."
5,An ASP Developers Book for ASP People,One of the best resources I have read! This book is great for generating ideas and moving your skill set forward. As a Developer at a Dot com I can say that his two books this one and ASP Scripts are excellent resources.
5,"Easy, clear, consistent",This book gave me a good overview of web application development and of the basics of ASP. The explanations in the examples were easy to understand and very consistent in their structure. This is definitely a good starting point in learning to use ASP. I would definitely recommend it.
2,"beautiful, VERY POOR QUALITY!!!","the bracelet was BEAUTIFUL, but the clasp broke the first time my mom tried to put it on. I was very disappointed."
4,Goood Up To The End,"I liked this anime right up to the end, but then it really didn't have an ending that was up to the rest of the series. The two OVAs were good but I would have liked to see how things were working out for the main characters after Mother decides to give them time. We are given a build up to the end and I just felt a little let down after all these two and their friends were put thru. Overall, this is worth the money to have in your collection. Not to bad."
3,Pink Frame,Nice frame. I was hoping it would be a little more of a brighter pink. It is a flat sort of dull pink. But seller packaged well and shipped quickly. A+
4,good suggesttions,The guide had some good suggestions for my short trip in NY. I only had a a few days to explore a limited number of streams in the capital region and the book gave some useful advise. I am looking forward to my next NY fly fishing trip and plan to consult this guide.
1,Superficial at best,"You won't learn anything from this book you can'f figure out for yourself by driving by the streams they review. Its a very thin book, and addresses each river quite superficially - its more like a brochure than a comprehensive guide to NY fly fishing waters."
2,mediocre and copyright issues,"I agree with the previous review, this is a mediocre book. In fact I personally took two of the photos on the cover, as well as most of large trout photos contained in the book, all were caught in New York, but the author gave the photo credits to the owner of a NY tackle shop. So, I really do not trust the written text as being accurate. That said, NY has some of the best fly fishing in the country and I've learned not to give fly shop owners copies of my fishing photos."
5,Wonderful rainy day fun!,"This was great! My son LOVED it. Must have patience to wait for the plaster to dry, so have some ""shark"" learning in between. Be extra careful with the finished product. My son dropped one but, luckily, there were 3. Overall a fun project."
2,"99 cents, I got what I paid for","This CD is a compilation of different styles of reggae. The artist list was promising, but none of the best tracks of these artists are found here. I paid 99 cents for this in the line at Fry's and it's just barely worth it."
4,"Get the DVD, it is better...","Satzine is correct in his review ON THE VHS example, up to a very limited point.However, if he had bothered to really review this entire program he would have realized that the booklet, which, I understand, is included with the purchase of the VHS tape and is, also, in the DVD subdirectory \Extras\TAB is all ANY beginner needs to learn the beginning steps to playing mandolin.Like most of Huckabees tapes and DVD's it is quite good at teaching a willing student...even one that feels limited in their abilities. If one has ANY adequate desire to really learn they can begin with the mandlin here. Start with fifteen minutes of practice TWICE per day and pretty soon you won't even notice how long you practice. Within one year you should be playing with a few friends. Just DO IT! Trust me on this."
4,Incredible Photos,"I had a wonderful girlfriend once who introduced me to her passion about Everest. That passion rubbed off on me and now I am hooked on the stories from Everest. For me, this book was the perfect followup to Hillary's High Adventure. The pictures in this book brought it all home. They made it feel like the pictures were taken yesterday, save for the old equipment. With this being the 50th anniversary of Hillary's climb, this book had a large focus on that climb and rightfully so.PS - I also was checking the book to see if she had made it up the mountain."
1,bad product,"This product looks nothing like the picture. The hair was matted all over and messed up. The toy dog was VERY used, not new (as advertised), and smelled bad from this use (including the package it had been in AFTER the toy was taken out - even the next day).Purchase elsewhere."
2,Sweet but not enough,This dog looks very fake and not at all like the picture. Would not purchase again.
2,"Cute, but not like photo","Out of all of the plush pups I've purchased (and I've purchased many!) this one looked least like it's stock photo. It's cute but the hair is very hard to style and quite difficult to keep in place. You'll need to use a baby brush and spritz lots of Johnson's ""No More Tangles"" to get this Pooch to even remotely look as silky as it appears in it's photo.. (lol) The Mohair on this one is quite dry and fly away.. the stock photo makes it appear more lush and silky.. it's not."
2,Sent it back,"Cute design but gets everything wet. Mist doesn't shoot out high enough to fill area. L, . . .. ."
1,Do Not Buy It!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this humidifier for my Daughter's room and at first it looked cute & worked fine.She used it gently, only switching on during nights. but one morning (in just two months time) she woke up & went to switch it off as always and the humidifier had stopped working. Just like that, it stopped working, I tried to get a replacement but my 30 day window for returns/exchanges had passed.So don't waste your money on it & try something better."
1,Poor Product,"This product lasted one month then started making terrible sounds when turned on and woke up the baby. It's a piece of junk. It's super cute, but not worth the money."
4,piggy cool mist,"the box doesn't say so and i don't remember reading it any reviews, but this definitely makes COOL mist (not warm steam)pros- too CUTE, quiet, mist lasts all night (at 75% power or less)cons- the water container is a little cumbersome to fill, carry, and place correctly"
3,"Adds moisture, but loud!","I got this for my daughter when she had a cold. My son has a crane dragon humidifier, but it is a pain to clean, so I tried this one. My daughter loves it; it is pink and it is cute. I am not so sure. I have to leave it on the lowest setting or the moisture coming out just drops to the floor. (Even on the lowest setting, it seems like it is too much and the area under her 4ft dresser seems slightly moist.) It is also loud. I can hear it in my bedroom humming. The crane dragon my son has does make some sound, but it is an easy to ignore white noise. This one cannot be ignored. My daughter says she does not notice it, but she is young and can sleep through almost anything. I am looking for a third humidifier for my other daughter and will not purchase this brand again."
3,Demonic pig no match for AK winters,"The pig works o.k. By day, it is a cute pig humidifier, at night a demon pig. The red power light illuminates the whole body and with the mist spewing out of the nose it looks like a demon pig. The head is hard to seat on the base to make it actually work. If you don't seat the snout on the face correctly you get a pool of water. The pig only holds about a gallon of water, which, in Alaska, makes for frequent fills. These can be dealt with, but not in the middle of the night in baby's room."
2,Did not work well,I use it for two days and the water in the tank never went down and hardly any mist came out. I was disappointed with the product.
5,Awesome and cute,"I bought this for a gift. The color of this humidifier looks purple, but actually the color is pink. Looks more beautiful. Also, it works very very well. I strongly recommend it. Very cute!!!"
2,BAD QUALITY,It stops to work within only 2 weeks without any reasons!!!Really waste money and I fell disappointed about this product!!
1,It broke right away!,"This is a cute design, but after about a month of using this, it stopped working! We threw away the box, so now I don't think I'll be able to return it to Amazon. Plus, though the design is adorable, the mist comes out of the pig's nose, which sits at an angle. The mist falls downward instead of getting pushed upward. We really like an owl-shaped humidifier where the mist gets pushed out of its head."
3,"Super cute, not sure how effective","I love my piggy, but I'm not sure how effective it really is as a humidifier. It seems like the mist just comes out the side and goes straight down. I've never had a humidifier before, though, so I don't have anything to compare it to."
4,Fender 3150R Guitar strings,The product was a good deal as advertisedThese were manufactured in Mexico and they sound greatwarm tones and not to bright I would buy them again.
2,Umbrella,"The umbrella arrived as promised but am sorely disappointed in the product itself, the clips to attach the solar collector to the top of the umbrella are made of plastic and broke off after attaching and placing outdoors on a mildly windy day. I was attempting to charge the solar battery and will figure out a way to reattach to the top of the umbrella. I would not recommend this product."
1,Small Content,"The article was very short less than 1700 words, and I found the content lacking any real depth which made it to me not worth the value paid."
3,Not the item pictured,"I actually have one of the litter trays pictured, and love it. It's a great product (except for the darn label, remnants of which are still visible over a year after purchase!), and has two-piece clips that lock this pan securely to the cage side. I recently ordered 2 more from Amazon, though, and received the new-style model, which is NOT pictured, and which does not have the two-piece cage locks to keep it in place. Instead, it has little tiny hooks which don't hook far enough over the cage wires. Consequently, it doesn't stay on the cage. If you can find the model pictured, I would recommend purchasing it. Buyer beware on the newer style."
2,Sucks,Ferrets dig under and fling this thing all over the place. Only way to keep it in one place is to tie it down
4,Works fine for my squirrels!,"Litter pan works fine for my rescued squirrels and I'm thankful for the high sides to keep things contained. The only complaint and what keeps it from a 5 star rating is that the clips to keep it in place do not fit on my particular wire cage. however, i simply put it as best i could and wrapped a heavy duty rubber band around the two hooks to keep it in place. works fine now!"
5,Easy to clean,"I'm using this as a hay box for our guinea pigs. I love how it fits in the corner to save some space. It fits tons of hay, and contains it well, so their cage is kept clean as well. Naturally, the pigs poop and pee a lot while in there eating the hay. One pig pretty much exclusively goes in the litter box, which makes it so much easier for me! I've found it I leave 1 corner without hay, and place a napkin in the corner, it's much much easier to clean up than if it all turns mushy. Anyway, I got mine recently, and it has little hooks that hook on the cage, rather than the whole clips it used to have. This is fine for pigs, but I could easily see it being a huge huge problem for ferrets--it's just way too easy for them to unhook. I think it would be pretty simple to drill a couple of holes and secure with twisty ties or something similar."
2,Expected Better,"Not really impressed with the litter pan. I mean, shipping was prompt and even showed up earlier, and it was well packaged. I later on read the ""Colors Vary"" part (I know, hard to miss), and when I got it, I was expecting green. At least you should have a color select if that's the case. Now I'm stuck with a litter pan that my ferret seems to hate and the color just sticks out. The product is also quite small. This is probably my first Amazon bad experience."
2,threw it away,"didnt hook onto my cage so it kept getting knocked over and litter got everywhere, which is a pain to clean up /:"
4,Nearly as good,"The music of Ellegies is some of the most moving I have ever heard. The premise of the musical was that the monologues were from the perspective of those who had died from AIDS and the songs were those who were still alive (only the songs are featured on the album).The only problem with this album is that it isn't as good as the newer version (which I also have). The newer version has the monologues and stars of the stage that are more famous. However, the orginal cast album does stand on its own and is the perfect addition to any collection."
2,Cheap but not so strong,"These are the cheapest batteries I could find. They work fine, but don't last too long. They are definitely not as good as the Lumix-made batteries, so you should buy a few."
1,Snake Oil,"I hate writing negative reviews, but I always appreciate it when people take the time to leave feedback. It really helps when you are trying to decide about a purchase. I snore when I sleep, my wife says it sounds like a subwoofer! Tried the nasal strips (kind of helped) and then I bought this spray. Complete waste of money! It reminds me of the old West and the snake oil peddlers. Don't waste your money on this product."
3,Go to H4n,"A great device for live recording but 2 things. First, there is the new and massively improved Zoom H4n which does so much more and simplifies a lot of the previous complications. Second I noticed as with any other important audio recordings you make, the better the SD card the better sound of the recording and less sound problems with this unit. I suggest using the 2GB SanDisk Ultra II or Extreme III cards in this unit (the difference in sound is amazing) and is the same with the H4n but it has greater capacity and can take a much larger GB card. The extra GB in the H4n alone is worth it especially for using the 96khz 24bit best sound process."
4,Pleasantly surprised!!,"I was a bit skeptical that the sound would be very good on any recorder in this price range. I'm using it for a songwriting group who meet to share lyrics & melodies of our efforts. We record each effort then make copies to give to everyone to work towards enhancing the song in their own time. We are all very pleased with the sound quality, and so far it has been easy to record and play back. There is a bit of a learning curve on the mixing and production steps after that, but it is do-able. My only disappointment is that the screen is small and the text inside it is waaaaayyyy too small. Why didn't they make that a bit larger? I can work with it under good lighting, but with dim lighting it is almost impossible. I use a magnifying glass for that. Other than that one issue, it was a great purchase. It is VERY portable and produces high quality recordings. I am extremely happy that after researching a lot of similar products, we chose this one."
4,My first recorder - working well.,This is my first handheld recorder. Been thinking about buying one for a long time. I haven't been using this one for long but it's up until now at least met all my demands.
4,Good and not so good,"Great recordings, plenty off accessories, but the lettering on the screen was too small and very hard to see. I had to sell it. It's a shame because I really liked it."
1,EXECSENSEI,Easy to use. Great sound quality. Great conception.Screen died on first use. Lousy execution.
4,Great Tool For music Composers,"First of all I would like to give you all a look @ my back round as a musician.I have played with Al green,Tyrone Davis,Jackie Wilson and the lady group The Emotions.I also have played with jazz greats like Von Freeman and his son Chico Freeman.I have been doing home recording for about 4 years.I really like this unit for the 4 tracks alone.When composing you can really get onto it being able to over dub on 4 tracks,I have also found out you can also go to where says track wav and record another track and another if you cursor down to where it says no data.I have not used the the the other stereo recording much but I did test them to see if they work.I also found out you must use the right SD Card for unit to work.I would give the unit a 4."
2,Frustrating Control Buttons,"I purchased the recorder primarily to use as a sketch pad and practice tool. I liked the idea of having multiple track recording capabilities. Unfortunately, the product did not work for me. While trying to record multi-track I found the control buttons to be sticky and non-responsive in a random sort of way. As a result I just couldn't get the hang of using them. That made working through the menus difficult and frustrating...the last thing I needed when trying to make a recording. I ended up returning the item."
4,Love!,"Very pleased and happy with this product. My only complaint is that the casing seems a little cheap and not very durable. But the sound quality is excellent and it is very user-friendly. My husband and I are musicians and need to record ourselves several times a week, and this product is perfect for that. I would recommend buying a larger SD card, so you can record for a longer period of time."
1,Too small. Get the new one,"The Zoom H4 should be taken off the market. I bought it before realizing there was a new one (H4n) that's much bigger, better, superior. I should have sent the original back, but I'd already used it!"
4,Zoom H4 Recorder,"First of all, the sound is simply great and the recordings seem to sound better than the original, even w/o effects or enhancement.I would have given it a 5 Star rating except for the fact that the fonts in the display are so tiny as to be almost unreadable without a magnifying glass.At first, I found it impossible to remove the SD Card without tweezers or something similar; but after some use, the card loosened up and it can now be removed more easily with just a fingernail.I think the H4 would be a lot simpler to use if the display were larger."
4,Great for the money,"I am very pleased with my H4. I actualyl use it for memos, then play it into a speech recognition package. The results have been great. The housing is fairly cheap - I agree. Menus are sometimes annoying. I wish I could record mono. The extra inputs are very handy!I'm very glad it also serves as a card reader!There are definitely higher quality units out there for portable recorders. However, ""for the money"" I have been completely satisfied."
3,"nice sound, poor build","I found the sound to be quite nice, but the piece itself left a lot to be desired. It just feels light and cheap. Its all plastic and the switches are all cheap feeling. The interface is small and confusing...not very intuitive. This is a small thing, but it ended up really bugging me: When you push the record button, it doesn't push in at all. There's no feedback from the button at all, so you don't know if it's been pushed or not. You just have to look at the tiny little display and figure out of the numbers are running.I wish I liked this, but I don't."
1,Don't Try Synching This Audio with Video...,"For some reason, the internal clock used by the ZOOM H4 is a bit off the ""true"" clock. What this means is, if you video tape an event or something, and at the same time record the same audio with the ZOOM H4 (using it as an additional audio source) the audio files produced by the ZOOM H4 will NOT SYNCH with the audio/video produced by any MiniDV Camcorder!!! The H4 audio runs slightly faster for some unknown reason. The manufacturer acknowledges the issue, but can't fix it. Which means all of your audio is actually playing back at a slightly different pitch than what was originally recorded. To me, this is inexcuseable for a product prioed this high."
4,Well worth it!,"After much shopping around and getting other's opinions, I went with the H4. So far I've only used it for live recording of rehearsals and it's fantastic! I thought I'd need to use my own condensor mic instead of the built-in mics on the H4, but holy crap these condensor mics work great. It's light-weight and super easy to use. I look forward to using it to record live shows and even some 4-track recording. Buy it! You won't regret it."
5,Amazing from Amazon,I purchased the H4 Zoom with some apprehension. I am so pleasantly surprised. I recorded an 18 piece big band with extraordinary results.Some tracks sound like pro recordings.
5,Zooming into Zoom4,"The Zoom4 recorder makes magnificent recordings and is a marvelous device. I found learning how to use it efficiently to be rather challenging and the learning curve is rather difficult (as with many new electronics these days). However, once the operating concept is grasped, recording becomes fairly routine, and uploading it to your computer is a snap. I heartily recommend this product!"
4,Great recorder,"I like it. Is sounds great, gives you lots of options for recording, and has a lot of useful features for recording (phantom power, easy access to recording options, built in mics).I can't imagine why anyone would say that it's tricky to figure out. I heard this before, so I purposely pulled it out of the box and tried to use it without cracking open the manual. In about 1 minute I was recording with the internal mics- easy. File navigation is easy, and most of the pertinent recording needs are located via buttons (on the top) or switches (on the sides).That said, I definitely wouldn't want to drop it. It does seem pretty flimsy, but I take good care of my stuff so I wasn't too worried about that aspect of it. That's the only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.You can't beat it at this price level!"
4,Very convenient recorder.,"I bought a Zoom H4 to replace a clunky old cassette deck at our church. It does everything the old cassette recorder did, plus much more. It's very simple to use, records in several different formats, then transfers easily to a computer for editing or copying of audio files. Sound quality is amazingly good for such a small device, and even recording through the built in microphones is not bad. The only reason I don't give it five stars is that the construction is somewhat cheap plastic and the included cd with audio software was defective and can't be installed. Overall, a very nifty little device."
3,"Close, but no cigar.","It works, and it's a nice little gadget, but the controls could be a bit more intuitive. The fact that you have to press record twice to actually record is kind of lame, and the fact that in order to change the SD card you have to take off the battery compartment lid is even more so. And why the hell can't somebody create a 4-track that has a manual in actual English? This requires a mind reader. Still, the sound is good, price is right..."
4,Good product but not compatible with my powered condenser mics,I bought this product from a friends recommendation and reading reviews. It is the only small (hand held) digital stereo field recorder of these types with XLR external mics connections. I bought the unit so I could plug my DPA powered condenser microphones using the XLR connections. The Zoom comes with phatom power but the DPA's have there own preamp and power supply which is a higher voltage system. I am getting distortion even when the input gain is turned down. The signal coming from the mics is at line level. These powered mics don't seem compatible with the Zoom H4
4,Great Recorder too few tracks,"This is a great recorder. A little complicated to use unless you mix sound and effects; I don't use the effects much, the recording quality is great. It is important to know that you can only record 2 mono tracks simultaneously, or 1 stereo track. I wish it had more input tracks for recording, but I knew this going into the purchase so I am very happy with it."
5,"Digital mike, don't look any further.",Mulultiple uses. One of the most flexible digital devices out there. Welcome to the future. SD card makes slot it totally practical and pragmatic.
3,"Well, it's food.","The good: Very good chicken flavour.The bad: I'm not sure for whom this is two servings, unless it's for people who aren't very hungry. I'm assuming that it was deliberately in very small chunks, but, and I do NOT think that it was the fault of Amazon's packaging, which seemed fine, it was mostly powder when it arrived. Dried chicken powder isn't appealing on any level to me. Also, why put the equivalent of a quarter of a cup of dried chicken powder in a pouch that would hold considerably more, even reconstituted?I'm giving it three stars because it was chicken powder that tasted like chicken, but I do not think I'll purchase this again."
2,A book I wasn't interested in finishing,"I've started and stopped writing this review a multitude of times. I think I feel guilty reviewing a book when I only got 100 pages in. But I think now that the fact that I am an avid reader, a romance novel reader, a sci-fi/fantasy reader, and have a great interest in greek mythology and shapeshifters, and yet I couldn't bring myself to finish this book speaks for itself. It was poorly written and the characters did not interest me. Enough said."
2,Not for everyone ~~,"I just could NOT get into this book ~~ I'm a lover of paranormals, but just had a hard time buying into this story, and just could not make myself 'feel' it. Maybe it was because it is a teen book, which I don't think so since I'm enjoying the Gena Showalter series so much, but for me this one was a miss."
3,Couldn't get into it...,"Reading the synopsis this book sounded interesting. I tried to read it several times. I'd get ten or fifteen pages in and couldn't get any further. I've been unable to pinpoint why I've had such trouble. Perhaps it is because I am not part of the intended audience, perhaps because I have read more classic mythology and this isn't that, I'm not sure why.Give it a try if it sounds interesting. Perhaps you'll like it more than I did."
3,"Incredibly interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying","If you need a fantasy romance fix, then by all means read this one. The main problem is an overdevelopement of the female heroine and an underdevelopment of the hero. Why does he care so much about her, except for the prophecy. The real characters to watch are Brenna and Brigid. Elphame needs to stop whining about her place in life. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, I just didn't understand why we should care so much about Lojain and Elphame."
2,NOT a YA read,"Why on earth was this marketed as a young adult novel? I am a teacher and bought this for students to read because so many of my students are hooked on The House of Night Series. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to read this and realize that it was EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ADULT VERSION of the book before I recommended it to students! With on-page masturbation and sex scenes, I most probably would have been fired from my teaching position.As an adult read, I enjoyed it; as a young adult read (both as a teacher and a mother), I am livid!"
3,An Intriguing Fantasy,"It's hard to figure out what the target audience for P.C. Cast's ""Elphame's Choice"" is.The cover and back cover blurb clearly mark as it for a young adult audience, but yet as I read it, I found it a bit darker than usual. And yet, it never quite goes dark enough for my liking. At times it feels like the book is trying to please too many people and be everything to everyone, which is a shame. It could easily have gone either way and been a far better and more enjoyable read.But, then again, I fully admit I may not necessarily be the target audience for the book. It's a young adult fantasy novel with a good helping of angst and romance. It almost seems designed to capture those who've read ""Twilight"" half a dozen times and may be looking for something new. And I'll give the book credit--it's at least more engaging and has a stronger female lead that the ""Twilight"" novels.As I said before, this one may not be up my alley. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it either."
2,Disappointing,"Although the book summary hinted at a compelling heroine and hero, love story, and plot... this was not the reality. I had to force myself to finish the book. It was disappointing since it seemed to have such a strong premise."
1,Pagan Relaxation Reading,"Elpahme's Choice by PC Cast is an enjoyable Pagan novel with its characters of a Priestess of Epona (Epona was actually a Pagan Godess of Ireland) Shaman centaurs, and a Princess whose two legs are those of a centaur but whose figure is essentially that of a human woman. Spells, blessings, etc. are done in true Pagan style with reference to the four elements. The protagonist, Elphane, the woman whose two legs are centaur legs, is seen by the humans as a Goddess and not as a human being with emotional needs. Thus Elphane must find a way in life where she not only has a purpose but can have a happy emotional life. So, she goes to restore a ruined castle to be Clan Chief there, but she must convince her followers to love and obey her as an approachable woman. So Elephame's Choice becomes a romance as well as a magical adventure...The language is simple and untaxing, so this makes a nice easy, entertaining read."
5,A book for fantasy romance lovers!,"P.C. Cast is a entirely new writer for me. I picked up Elphame's Choice because first the publisher was Luna and also the cover of the book looks amazing.Elaphame and her lifemate Lochlan are completely different charaters for any I have ever read before. Elaphame is a beautiful women on the top part of her body and has strong horse legs on the bottom, which have been touched by the goddess Epona. While Lochlan is part demon, with sharp vampire like teeth, talon feet and strong velvet wings.The bond shared between Elphame and Lochlan is nothing short then touching. This book is truely fill with the struggle of love and acceptance.P.C. Cast is a wonderful writer who brings the characters emotions off the pages and your heart. I will for sure be read the sequal to this book ""Bridget's Quest"" and also the book ""Goddess by Mistake"" which is set in the same world.All and all I strongly recommend this book to fantasy romance lovers!"
3,Lost interest,"My daughter has enjoyed other books by P.C. Cast so I'd hoped she'd enjoy this as well. But she never made it past the first few chapters. She told me that the storyline just didn't keep her interested enough to finish it. She doesn't have much interest in centaurs, although she did like the pagan aspects otherwise. For teens who are more into ghost or vampire paranormal stories, ""Elphame's Choice"" might not be for you."
3,Not for young teens,"This book was all over the place. Was it a romance? Romance set in a ""sci-fi"" world? Thankfully, though, this book was written better than _Tempted_. I'll need to review that one next.The book had promise in terms of the actual plot, but was beset by my reminding myself that the book was marketed for Young Adults (YA). It's actually more appropriate for the 16+. There is too much sex, in my opinion for the YA market. That said, I was relieved to see that the dialogue between the characters spoken and unspoken was not cliche filled--like some other books this author has co-authored.What I enjoyed most--the Sci-Fi aspect of the book. I would read another in this series in order to give her another chance."
3,good fantasy/romance read,"Elphame, the daughter of a unique parentage, has always been worshipped by those around her, based on how she looks. Wanting to be normal, she sets out to find a place to belong, hoping that place is Castle MacCallan, whose legends have captivated her her whole life. Her personal quest becomes a chance to save both her country and her soul mate.Having never read anything by P.C. Cast before, I may have missed some elements of Partholon that are explained in other books. But Elphame's Choice still worked as a stand-alone read, and was a good book for whiling away a few hours. For fans of adult romance/fantasy or paranormal romance novels."
5,"An astounding book, well worth reading (and rereading)!","I have been totally blown away by this little book! Dr. Marshall was an extraordinary man. He purposefully limited himself and wrote in simple every-day English so that the rest of us could understand the simple, but beautiful truths of the Gospel and the Bible. Dr. Marshall's humor is refreshing and inviting and his examples are both informative and entertaining. I wish I could have had the chance to thank him and I do thank his wife, Catherine Marshall very heartily for the part she played in putting this book together and in inspiring her husband. I highly recommend this book for all people, whether polititions, teachers, tradesmen, or teens! It represents and portrays the true story of human redemtion from sin through the love and sacrafice of Jesus Christ."
4,Fun!,"Book two of the Robotech series. I like these books more than I thought I would. The story is action packed with a continuing story line. The whole ""Miss Macross"" pageant thing was a little monotonous for me but the the story is really taking me in. I am going to read the third book now to see what happens. The book is a quick read and entertaining. No deep thought involved. Great for those times I want to take a break from philosophy, science and history reading."
3,False advertising - really 18/0.,"I just received these last night. I specifically wanted them for being listed at 18/10 stainless steel. Opened up the package and only one of the four items in it were stamped 18/10, the fork. The other three utensils are stamped 18/0, an inferior grade of SS, more prone to rust and tarnish. They are attractive and feel solid, and I'm not sure if this is worth returning them over, but its definitely not an accurate listing to claim these are 18/10 when 3 out of 4 pieces of the set are not."
5,Perfect Beach Flatware!,"Very happy--The flatware set comes with these pieces already, so I bet not many of these will sell. For us, it allows our beach renters to lose or distroy something without having to change the whole set!"
1,cheap for a reason,Did not last 5 min before it quit working I guess you get what you pay for. Not even sure I should waste my money shipping it back
1,disappointing,"I just picked up the dvd version of Fighting Mad and it sucks. There are only clips of fights, not the whole thing. During the fight scences you'll see a few punches being thrown, but there are no fights that are eye catchers. Fighters here either try and run away or stand and take the hit. You will find yourself fastfowarding to find something good only to figure out that there isn't anything there.If you want a run for your money stay with a bumfights video."
4,the classic musical re-imagined as a chamber-piece,"After its disastrous Broadway debut 12 years before, GIGI made it across the pond in a slightly-tweaked version and was a much more intimate in nature compared to its over-produced Broadway counterpart.This production boasted three veritable legends of the European stage in Beryl Reid, Jean-Pierre Aumont and Sian Phillips. Joining them as the romantic Gigi and Gaston, respectively, were Amanda Waring and Geoffrey Burridge.This recording is very different than the 1973 Broadway cast, in that the arrangements are more simplified and are thus more intimate and romantic. There is the addition of an Entr'acte that is quite beautiful, and the performances are uniformly excellent.Amanda Waring proves to be the perfect innocent little Gigi, whose personal and emotional journey is far more believable here than on the original Broadway album.All-in-all, a superb recording, and its such a shame that it is currently out of stock."
2,Tyrant's Guide.,"With such vicious ways mentioned on how to handle employees, I find it amazing that Jack Horn has managed to get the necessary supervisoral experience to write this book. But then again its not like the upper levels of management bother to listen to lowly employee's complaints about a tyrant of a boss.Although he does write some good info down on the basic chores of a supervisor daily, he is definitely stuck in the days of the Steel & Oil Tycoons where they would force their employees to work 60 hrs a week for peanuts.This book is really not a good source of information for a supervisor, unless he wishes to completely alienate his work staff, and cause a high job turnover rate, not too mention a lot of sabotage and theft on the job."
4,faucet,This was a pretty good price I guess in comparison to alot of other faucets for sale. It was alot lighter then I expected. It looks nice and functions well. So far so good. I hope it holds up better then the crappy & expensive Moen brand that we had.
4,Pretty darned good.,"After 45 years of homemaking I finally found a solution to dull instruments. I now own three of these products for sharpening; knives, scissors and this one for garden tools. I've used it on all of my larger objects. I call it ""sharpening for dummies"" because I have no skills but want sharp garden tools. If only they made a mini sharpener so that I didn't have to disasemble my pruning shears I'd be a very happy camper."
3,"Works OK, But Not Great",I bought this to sharpen lawn mower blade and garden tools. It works fine on garden tools but not so good on lawn mower blade. After I bought it I saw this product on the shelf at Wal-Mart. You may want to check there before you order on line.
1,SHarpens NOTHING!,"This isn't a difficult item to operate--I'm not somehow managing to do it wrong--it simply sharpens nothing. Even after 50 passes, no difference is felt in the sharpness of shears, pruners or loppers."
1,Didn't Receive The Right Product!,"I received a totally different sharpener. Not what I ordered Or wanted.FORTUNE 006 Garden Tool Sharpener, was not sent.I'm not real happy! I'll give it a one star, because I did get something."
5,Makes it very easy to sharpen lawn mower blades,"This product makes it very easy to sharpen lawn mower blades, without cutting yourself. Safety-grip handle makes it easy to just run the sharpener along the length of the blade. Quick and easy. I had my blades fully sharpened in less than 5 minutes. This product is easy to use even for the less than handy person."
3,ok for light duty sharpening,Tried this item on my mower blades which I admit due to my neglect were duller than butter knives. Was not effective but think it would be better suited for light duty sharpening or on items that are not that dull. Was easy to use as far as going back and forth on the blade.
2,Accu sharp Garden tool sharpener,Tool is not large enough to do axes and garden tools well. Needs to have a larger opening for axes and garden tools. Basically the same as the knife sharpener
4,Not a bad tune on the CD,"Clean, simple, lyrics + driving tunes make this a winner. It's very high energy and upbeat. There are some interesting musical elements that caught my attention... They frequently make use of an echo singer that is somewhat haunting. They also use multiple singers on the lead, which normally I might find annoying, but it works for them. Their sound is strong and unique... A cross between alternative, punk and rock. I like every song on the disc. I haven't stopped listening to it for the past couple days. I'd rate it as a Very Good effort."
3,Not Bad,An album for the ages? Clearly written by a familliar of the band. I some them by accident in a concert featuring Aphasia. I was immidiately won over by ther stage presence and energy. Great live act. There music is pretty good. If they can build from here who knows?
3,"Location, Location Location","The school ""Debbie Does Dallas"" was shot at is Pratt Institute of Art and Design in Brooklyn. It is commonly known amongst its students (me being an alumni myself) that ""Debbie"" was shot in the library (very recognizable dut to the frosted glass floors), the back entrance of the library (which has been locked for years), the president's office (to the delight of many students) as well as the locker rooms of the indoor pool which closed its doors in the 80's.I'v been to Dallas,Texas five times, its a beautiful city unlike my small crappy town Winnsboro."
5,Love ...the true meaning,"Even though I read at least 4-6 books a week from all genres, I don't usually write reviews, but for this book... I had to! It is a story about the true meaning of love, friendship, and family. I was hooked from the first page and finished it in one seating. It was one of most touching books I have ever read, and it left me feeling positive about this fragile life we all live. Thank you Erica, you have touched my heart!!!"
3,For the Intermediate student...,"I am a beginner German student, doing home study as well as using a private German tutor three hours a week. I found this book to be too confusing to use for a beginner. The Grammer sections are fantastic and have many useful examples, but the written and oral practice are too difficult for someone without a strong vocabulary base. It was especially dissapointing to realize that the answers are not included and you have to purchase the answer key in a seperate book. I recommend this workbook for any student who has intermediate level vocabulary skills... and don't forget to buy the answer key!"
4,Good for Intermediates and as a Thorough Reference,"I used this book with my third year students as a review of grammatical structures already learned and for the excellent activities. The activities were well thought out and support the prevalent theories on second language acquisition, using the communicative approach. It offers an excellent way to fine tune all grammar structures learned in a first and second year course and goes into some detail concerning the finer points of these grammar concepts, giving the interested student a challenge, if desired or needed. Subcategories are well divided so you can pick and choose which areas to highlight or to ignore, if you please. I myself have used the activities extensively and would say it is definitely a good supplemental tool for the intermediate and advanced German student. Another German teacher in my district intends to use it based on my recommendation."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Norman Flynn summarizes many arguments and viewpoints about Asia's 1997-1998 financial crisis. Flynn, who thoroughly documents his information with examples, charts and graphs, lays out the key pre-crisis weaknesses in the Asian economies. Then, he examines ways that ""expressive"" personal relationships, especially among the élites, define much of Asia's economic and political activity. He examines shifts in society, as globalization and supranational institutions (read IMF) move power from governments and élites to the markets. Flynn leans away from drawing conclusions - he prefers to present various points of view - but when he does state a conclusive opinion, he is persuasive. The book is packed with useful information, despite being short, very dense, and rather academic. We [...] recommend this excellent book to anyone with a serious interest in investing or doing business in Asia."
4,"Good stuff, yo.","Fast paced, pretty much no filler, great animation, good character design, both protagonists and antagonists shown to be three dimensional characters with genuine motivations, with humor and action and drama all combining well, this is a seriously well made show. The only real problem I have with it right now is that since it's a bunch of middle episodes, there aren't any plot points that get resolved. Good, solid story telling in a pretty package."
