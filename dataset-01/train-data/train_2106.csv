5,Complex and compelling,"I actually read ""The Average Human"" after first reading the author's book for adolescents, ""Olivia Kidney."" The two books are not really similar, but the writer's compelling, literary prose is equally excellent in both. The characters in ""The Average Human,"" who live in rural New York State, are complex and not easily understood. Yet they are compellingly drawn and very memorable. Since I read this book, scenes and phrases from it have revisited me frequently. I will certainly read it a second time. Ellen Toby-Potter (or Ellen Potter, which she uses in the ""Olivia Kidney"" book) is truly a brilliant writer; I look forward to her next works for both young people and adults."
4,Masterful Writing,Hard to believe this is a first novel by Ms. Toby-Potter. The writing is masterful. Her use of the English language is a pleasure to read. What a feat of imagination.I am glad I bought the book during a visit to NY last month.
5,Powerful journey through the heart of darkness,"A good novel keeps you reading; a great one, like Toby-Potter's ""The Average Human,"" keeps you up all night because you can't put it down. For a first novel it is remarkably well done; the characters are each distinct, sympathetic, and understandable. Each of them breathes, thinks, moves in a dark but nonetheless vividly truthful world toward destinies unknown.Is it interesting? Eminently. When I can retain images of landscapes, kitchens, taverns, and faces--that stay with me after I've put the book down--I feel like I've come to know this new world on an intimate level. I only experience that with superior character authors like Richard Russo, Graham Greene, and Stephen King.The language is beautiful; Toby-Potter's prose moves as easily as a summer breeze. Her voice is unique and she creates in a descriptive language all her own.Read this. I have several times. Keep writing, Ms. Toby-Potter."
1,"Awful, basically porn","Just a wanna be erotica emulsting anne roqulaire. Disturbing scenes trying to capture your atention but it is in many ways like watching a bad porn movie, a combination of sex in the city with degenerates"
4,"Loved the pictures, graphs and sidenotes","This book is interesting to those who love Wall St history but don't expect an in depth analysis of the last 100 years. Obviously this is a high level look with the book only being about 150 pages but the photos are what make it a joy to read. It was interesting to see how the market performed over these years and the author did a good job of adding some fun facts to visual display. In summary, not a lot of historical data but a pleasure to view."
5,Beautiful Story for Little Ones,I have given this video to several families with children because the story of Christ's birth is portrayed so beautifully and for their understanding. It is a joy for even us older ones to experience.
5,Love this movie!,"This is such an amazing movie! My kids are still asking to watching it even though Christmas is over. My only negative thing to say is not about the movie- I wish Amazon would specify what shipping company an item will be shipped with. At the same time I had ordered this movie, I also ordered another item. The other item was shipped via UPS and arrived within 4 days. This movie was shipped via DHL- I have never had a positive experience using DHL and this was no exception- this item arrived approximately 2 weeks later. I have an idea for DHL and a ""slogan""- Better late than never. If the shipping method had been listed, I would have chosen another site to have ordered from. With that said, the movie is great- you won't regret purchasing it!"
5,What's Not to Like,I bought this for my son last year when he was 7 and he recently started looking at it again. He loves it and so do I.
5,It's About Time!,We watched this movie on a Direct TV channel (surprise) and loved it! My four-year old daughter watched the whole 30 minutes without flinching and that says a lot. It's explained so simply and with such wonderful animation that even I was drawn to watch it and I never tired of it either. This is definitely a must-have for your Christmas collection. Thanks to Exclaim Entertainment for a refreshing and long overdue nativity story for everyone!
5,Awesome Christmas Story,This is a great Christmas DVD for the entire Family! We loved it and will make it a family tradition to watch every year!
2,It is 23 minutes long!,"I paid twenty dollars for a 23 minute ""movie"". I had no idea that it was only 23 minutes long. Disappointing. :( Item is way overpriced for what you get."
2,An ok movie,"I was looking for movies for my elementary and preschool students. This one was ok, but not great. It was a bit slow, and I was concerned that it would not hold my students' attention. I ended up not showing it. There were others that were better."
5,fantastic!,Have been looking for this DVD for awhile. Would highly recommend to others. Entertaining and a perfect gift. Arrived on time with no problems.
5,Must Have For Security Moms,"In the current political environment, there is considerable talk about ""security"" moms. I believe all mothers are ""security"" moms. Regardless of political affiliations, religions, or cultures, all parents want to keep their children safe. As a mom myself, watching the unfolding horrors of September 11, I wondered what I could do to protect my own family. Now that I have watched ""The New Civil Defense: Survival Basics,"" I know the steps to take. While I don't like to contemplate the unthinkable results of a terrorist attack, as a parent I believe it is my responsibility to be prepared.""The New Civil Defense: Survival Basics"" and the accompanying manual present expert counsel that will allow you to safeguard your family in all types of disaster situations. The presentation is affable, easily understood, and most importantly, it imparts crucial information in a practical way. This is an essential guide for all parents!!!"
3,Textbook Reviews?,"I find that for this type of product, if you need the book you need the book and ratings won't sway you either way. The price here was good and the book came in acceptable condition."
4,Vortex XL Diatom Filter - A Must to Own,This is an excellent product to own for anyone who owns a fishtank - fresh or salt water. It cleans and polishes the water and even filters out Ick. Cleaning and re-charging this filter is easy. The only frustrating task is attaching the pump to the jar so it doesn't leak. The o-ring doesn't always seal properly. I solved this problem with some extra sealing material (a cheap and easy solution that Vortex should have thought of including in their product design).
1,Defective,"After ordering this filter, and owning a smaller one for thirty years, it came and I unpacked it. Afew weeks went by, and the time came to put it to use. It's quality had changed drasticly from my older unit, but I thought, well okay, times change. A total NiGHTMARE! the pump motor overheated and seized and would stop pumping. After cooling, it started pumping again for a short time ( just long enough to pump filter sand into aquarium) What a mess, 125 gallons of water, full of filter sand. Now I have to repack it it and send it back for replacement. I AM NOT HAPPY AT ALL!! I am still cleaning up the mess it made. Also, much harder to start siphon then the older unit."
4,succesful gift,"My husband requested this for his birthday and loves it. He likes to show me his favorite episodes, and I've enjoyed it too."
5,Thank goodness!,I am so glad that Bewitched is finally coming out on DVD! I just hope that Sony will keep putting more and more seasons out after this!
4,Black and White is the Best,"I always liked Dick York better than Dick Sargent. He was the perfect foil for Endora, who found no end of pleasure in casting bad spells on him. But, this was Elizabeth Montgomery's show as the perky Samantha who could turn Darrin on with a twitch of her nose, even if he didn't marry her for her magic. The first season sets up the scenario which would be greatly elaborated on in years hence, with a slough of television celebrities doing guests spots. I always liked Bernard Fox as Dr. Bombay, who had to be called in to remedy some of the most vexing situations Endora cast Darrin into."
5,Bewitched B&W or you'll be sorry...,"I went to Circuit City, Target and Walmart today to buy the B&W version of Bewitched. They only had the color version and they told me that they were not going to carry the B&W version. I ordered it from Amazon. I was told when they first announced that the show was coming out on DVD, that the Color version does not have the complete episodes. They are syndicated versions, where they cut out a couple of minutes of the original show and then they colorized it. Be careful if you are buying the color version because you might be dissapointed. I have seen the color versions on TV and they look awful...Grey teeth, etc. I am sorry that the B&W version is not readily available but it is available on Amazon and other sites."
5,Fantastic,"Im glad that the series is on DVD. This first season I barely remember. It's in black and white, which was what our TV was back then, but it's very watchable. The beginning of a great series."
5,B&W or Color?,"I was actually looking for customer reviews to find out about the quality of the colorized version. While I remember most of the episodes being in b/w, apparently only the the first and maybe the second seasons were filmed in b/w. I thought it would be cool to get to see all of the episodes in color, but part of me was torn when i found out sony had released two versions. I'm kind of a purist, and thinking I should really own the episodes in their original b/w. However, after reading all of the reviews, I found out that the quality of the colorization was actually really good. Someone said that we could just turn off the color on our tvs if we wanted to see it in b/w... i dont know when was the last time we had a tv that could do that! I think most tvs dont really have that option anymore.anyways, i'm still torn over which version to get... but i'm definetly getting the whole set soon! and hopefully the other seasons will follow closely behind! (& I Dream of Genie)!"
5,Bewitched-The Complete First Season,I think it is great and if any other seasons are offered I woulddefiantly buy those as well!!!!!!!!
3,Excellent Package,"Bewitched was one of my favourite show back when I was a childin Australia, but they only showed the colour episodes, so it'sgreat to see season 1 in black and while (I don't like colourised episodes). It's a quality show and it even has subtitles which I appreciate. It's also good to see the evolution of the show, as it's just slightly different from the seasons that follow, quite a few ""human drama"" episodes in this season, like trying to get a collague a girfriend, helping a mother cope with her young son, adopting a child for christmas etc., the only disappointment about the Christmas show is that they didn't allow Darrin to remember the trip. The only major gripe I have about the package is that the opening titles are from 1966 not 1964, which annoyed me so much that I only giving this 3 stars!!!"
5,"Good-bye ""Nick@Night.""","Who needs ""Nick@Night"" thanks to this DVD? Best of all, we get to see the whole show since many times the opening sequence is edited out. Finally, we're in charge of our tv shows again!"
5,About the colorized version ...,"DON'T GET IT!! This is a FANTASTIC set, the first season of what was one of the great, most magical (pun intended) sitcoms ever aired. But if you're going to get it, buy the black and white originals! Not only because that was how it was originally filmed ...But also because the colorized episodes are EDITED; they are the original SYNDICATED epsiodes shown years later, when colorization came into vogue, and are edited for more commercial content.It you want each original episode in its entirely, black and white is THE only way to go! Forget the colorized junk!"
3,"Sweet Inaugural Season, but New Colorization is Too Intense.","I purchased the colorized version of season one because of the multitude of Amazon reviewers who raved about how natural it looked, and what improvements had been made with the technology since Ted Turner colorized everything he could in the 80's.Well, it's okay, fairly convincing, but too intense at times. (I turned down my color on the tv set a little bit to make it look more natural. Much better results.) Yes, they seem to have gotten the hues correct when it comes to Endora's hair and gowns, and skin tones are good. But there are still issues, like Larry Tate's fake looking hair color, and sometimes the furniture/walls/business suits all seem to have very similiar shades of gray/blue/brown. But it is acceptable, just not excellent which I had expected."
4,re: The First Season was shot In black and white,"To the person who wrote the review explaining the difference between the colour and b/w copies....a big thank you. I intend to buy this classic and noticed in the stores the two options and went seeking an explanation....and there it was on the first review search on Amazon.Cheers,Darren from Oz."
3,Digital Restore?,"I purchased the colorized set, I think a lot of time and care went into making the set look as if it was originally done in color. My only critisim so far is, during the first episode, there is a scratch line that goes right down the middle of the screen. I think that these should have been digitally restored, much like the I Love Lucy episodes. I realize the original I Love Lucy's were done in 16MM and these were probably not but more care could have been taken into touch up. Still, the color ones are the ones to opt for, even if you are a die hard TV fan, the color was done very well."
5,Why in color???,"I'm very excited that they released Bewitched, it was one of my favorite shows. I'm disappointed that it is in color, it distracts from what you are used to seeing - black and white. Was this colorized?? In any case, still very worth having."
4,"Almost as great as ""I dream of Jeannie""","Many of those who loved the ""I dream of Jeannie"", ""Bewitched"", ""Flipper"" and ""Gentle Ben"" TV series in their childhood also liked ""Kentucky Jones"" (Dennis Weaver) and ""The Farmer's Daughter"" (Inger Stevens).I wish these wonderful old TV series and many others like ""Yancy Derringer"", ""A Man called Shenandoah"" (Robert Horton), ""The Detectives"" (Robert Taylor), ""Hank"" (Dick Kallman), ""He and She"" (Paula Prentiss), ""The Magic Boomerang"", ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (Jack Palance), ""Adventures of the Seaspray"" would finally be released on DVD.The Baby Boomers would be more than happy about it!!!"
5,wonderful,who wouldn't want a mother in law like Endora. She fun and exciting even when she's bad. Works for me.
3,Turn Up The Heat,This book was an interesting read.Not only are there ways to changeeatiing habits but also excersize options. The reader has to determine whether or not they are willing to invest the time andenergy to see this diet thru till it starts to work.
5,A too-long-lost treasue!,"Totally fun, totally weird read-- highly recommended for fans of Gothic/Victorian novels, murder mysteries, or just a good thriller!"
2,"Booklet, not book","This item is not a book, it is a booklet. It has less than 80 pages. It has a paper binding and the inside of the book looks to be desktop published. There are approximately 12 stories which are the same as the ones found in Mr. Traywick's book ""Ghost Towns and Lost Treasures,"" which can be purchased cheaper than this item and contains 28 stories."
1,"Defective - pages missing, other pages repeated.","I had two shots at ordering this book. The first copy I received had pages 15 through 30 missing, I returned it and the second was exactly the same (I can't tell whether Amazon simply sent me the first copy again). Given the problem with the first book you would have thought someone might have checked their stock. So sadly this book is simply not worth ordering."
1,"Title should be ""Bore"" Values","This book might give you some insight into life at the Academy--but as a novel it is poorly written and just a ""bore"" to get through. If you compare the writing quality in this book to Webb's book about USNA or Truscott's about West Point you'll know what I mean. Save yourself the trouble of reading a badly constructed book and read the ""Candidate's Guide"" by Smallwood--many of the same insights and you get to skip the wooden characters and bad dialogue. The basis of ""Core Values"" can be summed up in a sentance--the honor code can be used by a rival to destroy a fellow cadet, but things have gotten better and there are more safegaurds in place that can prevent that from occurring. The author means well, and his heart's in the right place, but he should have taken more creative writing classes and fewer science labs!"
3,Interesting book,"This book is chock full of information. Unfortunately, the author's 21st century attitudes prevail over the information. He persisted in interpreting attitudes and behaviors in a modern context which created a negative impact on the reader."
2,"Risky, But Could Have Been Better","A former Massive Attack collaborator, Nicolette presents a somewhat interesting yet flawed record that combines trip-hop, breakbeat, funk, soul, techno and electronica. It truly is an edgy and innovative album, still it doesn`t quite suceed at providing a cohesive and very solid final result. It has some intriguing moments and soundscapes, mostly those produced by Atari Teenage Riot`s Alec Empire, who creates a couple of dark and hypnotic gems here, still overall it only makes for a different enough yet average listen. It`s not easy on the ears at times, and a share of songs are really impenetrable. Well, at lest it tries to present something new, even if it is mildly disappointing overall.Worth a listen, even if it`s an uneven record."
2,"Short on substance, long on touchy feely","The basic concept of proprioceptive writing seems solid and useful to individuals seeking insight to their motivation and behavior. However, this book was disappointing in that it took until page 32 to get to the meat of the matter. Long introductory chapters seemed endless and were repetitive, redundant and boring (such as the author's backstory). Perhaps because the useful concept is such a simple and straight forward tool, the editors felt compelled to encouraged the authors to pad the product to make it ""book worthy."" In which case, the padding was added to the wrong places."
4,Right the Write questions' answers to get your voice to flow,"The best tool from this book are the Proprioceptive Questions and the ritual of doing a ""Write"" the right way. This book provides lots of examples of how clients have benefited from this techniques. It's interesting to know that people have used this to uncover subconcious core beliefs as a complement to therapy as well as help with creative expression. Proprioceptive writing is good to know especially when you're on a deadline and just can't expell a word onto the page. Wonderful for brainstorm session to get literary voices flowing. Brilliant in its simplicity."
5,Getting in touch with your subconscious,"I just finished a writing class where the teacher spoke about our character's early childhood wounds and how those wounds lead our characters to see the world through a flawed perspective. Epiphanies in stories occur when the character recognizes that this flaw prevents him or her from attaining the goal. The character still lives with the wound but is able to recognize the flawed thinking as a detriment to personal growth, and, in the dramatic situation, a hinderance to attaining the external goal. This, I think, is all our stories, and I think this book, by way of the proprioceptive method, allows one to get in touch with the wounds that hold one back. Does it work? Who knows. We are talking art and science here and proof is not easy to come by. For under twenty dollars it is enormously more simple than numerous visits to the therapist."
2,Not much comedy...,"this is more of a story of the comedy club, and not really a whole lot of comedy is on the cd. I was hoping for more Jim Carrey on the CD, but there wasn't enough to please me. There are some interesting moments on the CD, and it may be good for you if you want to know about the history and so forth of the comedy store."
1,Music for your girlfriend or granny,"You wanna know what's wrong with the music industry today?It is cross-over like this.Watson is one of those singers whose voice is slightly too trained to sing Pop or Rock, but not good enough to sing real opera (Berg to Verdi to Mozart to Monteverdi, I mean).Trashy, schmaltzy, sentimental and kitsch.I just can't imagine why people get so excited about singers like Russell Watson and his ilk."
5,MAGICAL VOICE OF THE 21ST CENTURY,"Russell Watson takes you places you have not been before. When he sings, you truly believe you are hearing the voice of an angel. Russell's voice is better than ever. Amore Musica track and You Raise Me Up are my favorites although I love most of the others too. He never ceases to amaze me and I can't wait until Russell's next album because he will choose the most beautiful songs for all his old fans and new fans to cherish. Russell truly sings straight from the heart. Don't miss out on this beautiful voice. His others, The Voice, Encore, and Reprise are special. And don't forget the dvd video concert. Russell's voice is destined to be the best for our 21st century."
2,Lack of photos and diagrams,"The reviewer Robert is correct: the book does not have ""step by step"" pictures of the procedures. So, it's very difficult to learn what is written without previous knownledge."
4,Another Valuable Source of Information,I think it must be made very clear that no one publication can or does hold all of the information a person needs to repair or actually build a watch. This book is one of many valuable sources of information that a watchmaker needs to fulfill the job requirements.
1,Simple book from a simple mind.,"This is a waste of time and money. With the big threat of Virus and Piracy in the Information age, anyone can seek to capitalize on people's fears of something they do not understand. This book is a perfect example"
3,Changed from 2 stars to 3 stars 03/29/2004,"I have grown to like this atlas more after using it, and have toned down my original review. Still not as good as the previous editions, but some things have improved. North America coverage is better, more extensive. The binding is still good (strings in the spine) so it wears well. The main thing I don't like about this edition is changes to the maps themselves. They are a little harder to read I feel. However, this new edition has some new sections which are nice: World Statistics (population, size, capitals); Climate maps; World Gazetteer (additional details about 30 countries; flag, government type, employment break down). The index is still very good, with over 11,000 entries. I would still suggest to get a copy of an older edition (in the Used section?). I have two previous editions; one from Prentice-Hall around 1983, the other by Penguin a little later."
5,Excellent Devotional for Chronic Illness Sufferers and Others,"Wow! Very enjoyable devotions on just about any issue. As an MCS sufferer myself I appreciated that the book was specific to those with chemical sensitivity, however the devotions would serve as a blessing to anyone. Once you have read this book it also serves well as a refresher reference."
4,American Folk Tales,"I bought this book for a Creative Writing Assignment I am doing with a class of 5th graders. I read them one of the stories and then asked them to write their own versions, using one of the characters from several of the other stories. These stories, re-imagined by Mary Pope Osborne are written in such a way that keeps any age of reader interested. Accompanied by wonderful wood-etched drawings care of Michael McCurdy, it allows a child, who has very little understanding of the way things worked before planes and cars, to get a feel for our early American times and the way these larger than life characters lived."
5,great for a snoring partner!,"I snip the cord off with a pair of scissors, I leave just enough of the cord to pull for easy removal."
4,Not meant to be taken out and put back in,"Good sound protection, but once you take them out, there is no way to put them in and you have to use another pair."
4,hearing protectors for loud concerts,after going to one too many live concerts where the performance volume was causing damage to my ears I decided to get ear plugs. These are great because they have a little cord and are easy to remove vs the ones without the cord which can get stuck in your ears.
5,Best of ALL Earplugs!!,"Definitely the BEST earplugs. Great for sleeping on airplane flights, hotel stays, slumber parties, neighbors nighttime get-togethers. Very comfortable to the ears. Compresses and expands to the size of your individual ear opening. Cuts out noise!! :) Cord allows you to keep track of ear plugs. Don't lose them in the bed or workshop. Hang over neck and insert. Twist in morning to remove - easily breaks suction without damage to eardrum. Still can hear alarm clock, but without an alarm clock, you may sleep in. ;)"
4,Multinational Financial Management,"It is use full, but if I didn't have it for a class I would not purchase it."
2,Be Careful what you buy,"This is NOT a text. There are many reviews that this is a text. It is not. It is a very small book with about 40 pages of activities. It appears to go with some kind of text. This I am not sure of. I purchased this item based on reviews. I was disappointed, thinking I had found (based on reviews) a great text. So just want to warn future buyers. If you are however looking for a small paperback packet this is it."
3,the book was in great shape but.........,"Disappointed, this book arrived to late, I paid 2 day shipping and I got it a week and a half later. However, they refunded the price or the extra shipping."
4,"fast paced, couldn't put it down, lots of sights and sounds","This book presents the joy, beauty, humility, helpfulness and resilience of America and the American people, told through the eyes of a Mom as she travels with her growing children: a son and daughter. I so enjoyed sitting in my big ""comfy chair"" while taking in the descriptions of their journey. I have heard the author speak of her travels in the past, so having an opportunity to sit and really soak it in made me feel as though I was right there in New Paint (their van) during every mile. What a great trip and beautiful family. I am happy to recommend this lovely book."
1,Hardrive failed after 13 months,The warrenty is good for 12 months so I am out the cost of this unit minus my 13 months of use but I would expect this type of equipment to last much longer. It is a nice looking unit but it has no long term reliability in my experience.
2,Broke.....the yoke,"Broke after ""over torquing""....frankly from the grain structure of the cast iron, this material is just not up to the job. Would not think of purchasing again...there are parrot vises out there made of steel...find one and use that. This vise was simply not acceptable for any cost. Two stars because Amazon took care of the return and made it easy....at least you can purchase from them with confidence."
4,Good Vise; No Instructions,"I bought this vise after comparing it to the Brownells Multi-Vise. This vise was significantly cheaper, but has the same features as the Brownells vise.I was initially disappointed when I opened the package. The box did not include any manuals or mounting hardware. While I was able to mount the vise on my workbench using a combination of screws and bolts I had around the garage, it would have been nice if the vise had included them.After installing the vise, I am impressed with the quality. It appears quite strong and the gripping strength is sufficient for my gunsmithing needs. I particularly liked the ability to flip the vise on its side to hold items vertically.For those who care, the vise is made in China. I found the workmanship to be just fine, but this is not for those who are buying American.All in all, I like the vise and the price I paid for it."
5,Great Vise,"I make knives for a hobby and needed a vise that could hold my blades in all positions. This vise does just that, is well made, and it's capacity is much more than I require. I highly recommend this product."
4,Great Light Duty Vise,"Needing a lightweight vise for general purpose work...and having looked at the prices of others, I bought this one.It isn't the best, and the finish leaves much to be desired, but for the money, it's a good little vise."
2,Vise,"Action screw is rough, feels like poor machining. Grease does not help it.I will sell or give away and get American made product."
2,The metal latch bangs into the door,"The swinging latch bangs into the door in the locked position, denting it. Had to stick a felt pad on it. Kinda lame. My previous latch didn't have this problem. Otherwise, it is fine."
2,NOT for doors with moulding,"The quality of these items is indisputable; they are durable and hotel-grade door locks. However, I was extremely disappointed to find that these are NOT for doors with an elevated molding. My back door has a pretty thick (3/4ths of an inch) molding around it and this item will not properly fit doors as such. Both the door and the wall must be flat and at an even surface with each other."
2,To reiterate - NOT FOR DOORS WITH MOULDING!,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, this thing will not work unless the door and the frame are exactly flush. Costs too much to return (I'd get back a 1.20 if I paid the 5.20 shipping to return), otherwise feels like a quality product."
1,Having issue with my three Tiger America 10 c. Electr Rice Cooker/Warme ( JAZ-A18U ),"I like the brand, had one for years, but the modeled I owned no longer in production. I have bought three of these rice cooker model #JAZ-A18U; one each for me, my son and my mom and all three rice cooker lids does not close tightly and If we keep the rice warm the next day; the rice started to spoil. At first I have my reservation, but when my son and my mom have the same issue; then it's effeminately the rice cookers are having issue.How do I go about having this replace and/or refund?"
2,Not much!,"I loved this song so much I thought I would buy a CD with different mixes to enjoy it even more. I was wrong. There is one decent remix and the other two are horrible. The fourth remix, the original, is still the best. Buy the single on I-tunes."
1,Disappointing...,"I had a seminary professor who said that if you get one good illustration out of an illustration book, you got your money's worth. Well, I guess I got my money's worth, but I was expecting more. Many of the ""illustrations"" are quotes from Swindoll's books, and weak quotes at that. And many of the illustrations are simply limp. With as much preaching experience as he has, one would think he could present a better line up than is found here. Maybe he just didn't want to give out his A material. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this book unless you can find it at a rock-bottom price. And even then, you might have paid too much for it."
5,A Big Help,"Thank you to Ms. Klein for taking the sometimes difficult, sometimes dry, and sometimes ""mature"" nature of the weekly Torah portions and making them accessible to kids. I use it with my own young children, who love the ""claymation"" art, and also with my Religious School third graders in my Torah lesson. If only there were accompanying worksheets or art projects! :)"
1,Pay and then pay again.,I can't believe you are selling shareware that has to paid for once you purchase this CD. That is just VERY misleading. I returned the product unopened. Shame on you for not divulging that on the website...sure would have saved me a lot of headache!!
1,Cut and Paste,"I bought this book hoping it would help me in planning my upcoming trip to Patagonia - no such luck. Basically, Chapter One contains the author's dryly written noodlings from his trip diary - which, by the way, follows the typical tourist trail itinerary that your local travel agent could beat after putting in 45 minutes of research. The rest of the book has the quality of downloads from the web and excerpts from pamphlets left over from museum visits. Maybe the book was just the author's half-hearted attempt to recoup some of the cost of his trip (good for him, bad for me). Wow! What a waste of time."
1,Awful and ugly,"I truly dont understand why everyone loves this product. Like all Bratz dolls, it's ugly! It has an oversized head, oversized feet, and oversized lips and eyes! But I hate this one more then a lot of others. Her first looks dry and washed out for reason. Her lips look like she's not wearing lipstick adn her eyes just look plain weird. I dont like her clothes either. The white jacket is too puffy and the pants just are odd."
1,bratz suck,all u bratz fans who say myscene copies bratz are wrong because bratz forever diamonds copied myscene bling bling because bratz just wants to take all myscenes fans and money and myscene came out in 1999 and bratz came out two years after myscene so bratz are coping myscene
1,SHE IS UGLY!,This doll is ugly. And they copied myscene. Bratz should realize that they will NEVER be as good as myscene. Also those diamonds don't even look real. And she doesn't even look like she is wearing makeup. This collection SUCKS! Face it Bratz fans. Myscene is better than these...these THINGS!Number 1 Bratz hater!
1,Bratz or Bratz Kids?,"The two images are of different products, one is a Bratz doll and one is a Bratz Kids doll. How are we supposed to know what we will get?"
5,Wow!,"I love this doll. She is soooo pretty. Some people think that the Forever Diamonds set is a copy of My Scene Bling Bling but it is not. It is alot better because The Bratz' clothes are alot less revealing and have less ""bling"" which makes their outfits realistic and classy."
3,Ok.... Just Ok...,"Picked up these pads for my 98 and I thought I was going to get amazing brake pads for this price but man they are not worth it.What I do like is they stop amazing and seem to wear well but the noise is extremely annoying. At almost any stop the pads squeal, I have found that this is a common problem with hawk pads in general and wish i would have found out sooner. I replaced them with wagner and couldnt be happier. Biggest waste of $70.."
3,"Quiet, but Low Max Stopping Power and lasted only about 33k miles","Installed Hawk HB332Y-654 front pads on my 1999 Yukon about 2 years ago. They do give off a bit of dust, but no worse than other pads. They've been quiet the entire time I've had them. Unfortunately, they've even been quiet as they've started to wear into my rotors. Noticed much better initial bite when applying the brakes, but I could stand on the brake pedal with both feet and not lock up the front tires. Yes, I could do that with the former pads with the same tires. They now need to be replaced after about 33,000 miles.I don't mind paying more for high quality parts. I might even be satisfied with their 33k mile life, if they were particularly good pads. But the low maximum stopping power has taken them off my list for replacements. In that sense I'm glad I'm getting to replace them after only a couple years."
4,This is a great unit!,"First off I'd like to say that I'm a keyboardist for over 21 years and this is my first Digital piano purchase. This Digital piano is a great machine, it sounds great, feels great and what else can you expect from Yamaha? It truly is weighted and the thing I love about it the most, it's only about 37 pounds. It's really light compared to its predecessors. I've been gigging with a Motif 6 which is 42 pounds and only has 61 keys. The thing I'm most disappointed about is that the main outs are RCA and you cannot control the volume. For a live on stage situation, this isn't ideal and I didn't realize this until after I bought the piano, that's why I'm only giving it 4 stars."
4,Soft Hair,This product works very well and I use with with their hydrating shampoo. The only thing I don't like (aside from the price) is that the smell is so strong that it makes me cough.
5,Love this stuff.,"I love the hydrate shampoo and conditioner. I have long, fine hair and live in Colorado where it is very dry. I heat style my hair nearly every day so I only shampoo about twice per week. Other days I simply condition and rinse, skipping shampoo. This has worked very well for me and my hair doesn't get oily or greasy. I even use some moisturizing product in addition to the conditioner with only twice weekly shampooing. I received the item well packaged and in a timely manner from this seller as well."
4,Definitely worth reading.,"It took me a few books to get into Ms. Bland's style of writing but now her character, Marti McAlister, is one of my favorite detective stories. In this one Marti finds out more than she bargained for regarding the death of her husband. When she pulled the puzzle pieces together I was both happy for her and enraged about the findings all at the same time.Thanks Ms. Bland for writing a good detective novel with a main character that just happens to be black and female."
3,Had trouble getting into it.,I had a little trouble getting into the book. The motivation seemed wrong to me. But then I don't read a lot of mysteries.
2,A book without a natural audience,"If you don't already know Outlook 98, don't try to learn it from this book. The information is presented alphabetically, and is thus unsuitable as an introduction. Experienced users won't need the information in this reference, so the question is, who was this written for? My best guess - users of Outlook 97 who want to see what's changed. I would be interested if anyone out there can recommend an Outlook 98 book for sophisticated programmers."
3,Not that great but good for the price,You can't go wrong for 6 bucks. Its no that great but I have to admit it did help me a few times.
5,A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This book is FABULOUS!!!!!!! Robyn Boyd has done an excellent job in pulling together vital information for HEALTH!!!!!! Absolutely everybody should own this book!!!This book is an important tool in my fight overcoming Cancer!God Bless you Robyn!
4,Great luggage piece!!,"I like this expandable luggage on wheels. I was able to attend a week-long workshop bringing just this one bag. I didn't, though, find it easy to put into the airline's overhead luggage storage. It barely fit when the expandable portions were not stuffed, at least, for me."
1,bad description,"description does not make sense, Aspire and Sarano are two different lines of Samsonite, has to be one or the other"
4,Wine Bottle Lights,"This set is really cute and I have had lots of compliments on them. I have wrapped them in a silk plant. My only complaint is that several corks have become detatched from the cord, but since they are in the plant,it's not noticeable."
3,Amstaff book using the name Pit Bull to sell titles,"this is a good book for people who want an Amstaff but it really isn't an accurate representation of the American Pit Bull terrier. Most of the pictures are of AKC registered Amstaffs rather than pit bulls with some exceptions to a few from ""wildside kennels"" and ""southern pride kennels"".I found the History of the breed section rather interesting even though I believed less than half of it. The worst part of the book concerns criteria for breeding. The best part of the book is the information on how to bring up a healthy, happy puppy to adulthood. Including some good training info even though she does leave some vital information out such as a good method for correction. I would recommend this book to those that are wanting to own a ""pretty showdog"". Keep in mind that if this is your first real American Pit Bull Terrier puppy you may be in for a rude awakening if the only knowlege you have on the breed is what comes out of this book."
2,Grudig SW / BB AM/FM radio,Product requires additional antennae to receive SW transmissions.Does not have sufficient filters to eliminate static.
5,Fantastic!,"The story of Matt and Khym is fantastic!Tony and Peggy made a great documentary here showcasing a real relationship and even allowed us a special peek, if you will, in to their lives.For a moment, let's take the sex out of the movie. Here we have a fascinating story of a couple and how they met and fell in love.The sex...Well, the sex is just an add-on to the story. It seems like a logical extension of the story that the filmmakers were telling. The physical representation of the words the couple was speaking.All in all, this was a very enjoyable film that was beautifully shot and put together very well."
2,Slow and shallow,Content was very shallow. Wasn't worth the money spent. I was disappointed. I don't know what I expected but this fell short.
1,Don't Bother,"I had previously ordered Xana and Dax by Comstock films and though it was pretty good so I decided to get Matt and Khym. I listened to the reviews for Matt and Khym, they all had real positive things to say...what a big mistake!! The movie was unfocused and blurry most of the time and the camera angles were all over the place. It looked as if someone took a handrecorder and recorded from another dvd playing on tv. I don't know if this was what the film really looked like or if I received a big dud from the seller... Highly disappointed, so not worth $19.95."
2,Good but not good enough,"Cute story about the couple, but come on guys, it's a sex dvd - i don't really care about your entire life story, in fact, I don't want to know it.Yes, the couple are obviously very much in love and when they do make love it is really 'well done' - that felt odd to type! BUT some music might have been nice, or some sound. They make love in complete silence which I found really off putting."
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"The ""Real People, Real Sex"" label had been used, very successfully about twenty years ago by a different producer. That series of VHS tapes included a great deal of foreplay in a loving and sophisticated way, with the couples talking and communicating during lovemaking. The Comstock series seems to be about 1/2-2/3 talk, which seems superfluous, then a rather mild and not terribly sophisticated session of sex. I would recommend either Vivid's Sex-Ed series or the Jaiya Red Hot Sex series ahead of this one."
2,too nice..,"Very nice film but too much talking. Sex parts were good, not gross but nice for a woman to see but the talking while very touching really was too distracting."
1,Too Much Chatter,Way too much inane talk between the couple. Listening to it was so boring we shut it off. I was very disappointed and so was my wife.
5,Philip Kiameh has done it again !! Another practical book,"Philip Kiameh has provided us with another practical book that focuses on Power Generation equipments. This book begins with an introduction to Electrical Engineering concepts and then continues with electric machinery, motors, transformers and generators. This book is very well written with excellent examples and figures. The book is also intended for those who are not electrical engineers and provides a comprehensive picture of electrical equipments in industrial applicatons. It is a must for anyone working in an industrial environment."
5,A Handbook for everyone,"Philip Kiameh has done it again. This handbook contains all the essential components of electrical equipment. Its' detail illustrations and examples gives the reader a comprehension view of electrical equipment.The book starts with the basics of machinery principles and then provides details of transformers, motors, generators, fuses, circuit breakers and variable speed drives. Philip provides excellent tips on the maintenance and troubleshooting of each equipment.I would strongly recommend this book for design, operations and maintenance personnel."
4,Great story with dark humor,"Ms. Haynes has an interesting and enjoyable writing style. I read Mother of Pearl, and for the most part liked it, but Willem's Field was much more to my taste. Set in 1970s Mississippi, this book is a study of very real people with very real issues, quirks, and afflictions.Small town life is perfectly portrayed, and the characters are nicely developed. The darkness and heartbreak that goes hand in hand with the real life struggles of this family is something that the author handled exceptionally well. I particularly enjoyed the way Willem's panic attacks were portrayed, and the humor (most of it dark) that balanced the hardships was great. The story was a little slow at times and there were a lot of sub-plots to follow, but once I got into the rhythm of the writing and how the story went from Willem's viewpoint to viewpoint of the Tills, I was pulled into the story in a very satisfying way.I recommend this book and will look forward to more from this author."
5,Poignant,"Elaine Bartlett is truly an inspiration to others who is or has been in prison under strict legal regulations. set up by federal government policymakers. Here is a woman who missed sixteen years of her children lives and life itself because of one bad decision made on her part. What does this say about the criminal justice system we live in today? Couldn't Ms Bartlett had a lesser penalty being a one-time offender?However, I salute Ms. Bartlett for her courage and nobility to moving on after sixteen years detained in the prison odyssey. She's really a moving force who prevails at nothing to get both family and her life back in order. This is a must read to everyone to know how it feels, when your freedom is taken away from you."
5,Life on the Outside : The Prison Odyssey of Elaine Bartlett,"The book was wonderfully written. It gave me a lot of insight as to what was going on in New York in the 1980's. I loved it. It was an awakening for me. Being a child that grew up in the same neigborhood and knowing the family very well, this book brought back a lot of memories and explained a lot of things. Thanks for writing this one Elaine."
1,Reactionary Nonsense,"This book could have been written in 1890; all the old rubbish is here - smug Anglo-Saxon superiority, the belief that ""human nature"" makes socialism and even serious reforms impossible, the angry assertion that the so-called natural order of things has been needlessly disrupted by such dastardly trouble-makers as Plato, Thomas Moore, Rousseau and, above all others, the red devil Karl Marx. Not a word here about the roles that the slave trade and piracy by such delightful fellows as Drake and Morgan played in the growth of capitalism in Britain and North America. If free market capitalism brings freedom, then how come such tyrants as Pinochet, Francisco Franco and Somoza loved it? And why did the German capitalists finance Hitler? John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan would have loved this book. Rosa Luxemburg and and Martin Luther King would have hated it. That says it all.t"
5,"As an economist and historian, I gladly reccommend this book","It is truly a good find to see a historian whom I have great respect for venture into territory I ahev a great love of. In the no-nonsense style that he has made his mark, Mr. Pipes makes an argument that many social scientists and economists find central to the idea of Western civilization- freedom and respect in the most every day aspects of life- freedom in realm of the economics.This is a refreshing book, and its detractors in the review section are wrong."
2,A Poorly Compiled Single,"I bought this in hopes of FINALLY obtaining the sought after Junior Remix of this dance classic. I was disappointed in finding that the mix labeled ""Junior's Factory Mix"" is not Junior's version but the version you can find on her album Land Of The Living. The first cut is just a simple edit you can do yourself on a cassette player or with a simple mixing program on a pc. The rest of the remixes are boring house versions (sound of the late 90s) that should have never been released as they shame Kristine's wonderful vocal track. If you download music from any sight you should try to find Junior's wonderful remix which is a bit harder with his signature vocal tricks; also, ""Peeree's Extended Mix"" is quite good for a remixer who I've never heard of. Neither of the latter remixes are on this ""maxi"" single:("
2,"Good, but buggy starting point for writting Java game","This book was a good starting point for developing Java games, but the code is very sloppy and unprofessional. It is obvious that they didn't test it at all (don't believe the nonsense that they've fixed things since the first printing, I bought it in 12/98). If you don't mind spending hours and hours (and hours) fixing their bugs, I would recommend the book."
2,Needs updating,"This book is now old - originally published in 96. Java haschanged significantly since then. The major impact to theusefulness of this book is the Java3D API.Positives: The book does a good job of starting with simplergames and then adding additional features such as networkinglater. It also mixes in useful material on theory suchas BSPs, ray casting, and texture mapping.On the whole, I would not recommend buying this book now."
4,CEJGP Covers It All,"CEJGP (The real name's too long!) is really great for anyone that knows a bit of Java and wants to start making good games for the web. It covers network games, multiplayer, single player, strategy games, a bit of Artificial Intelligence, and even how to make a Doom-type 3D game. Not recommended for someone just wanting to get in and start programming games, it does require some patience, especially if you aren't too familiar with Java or game programming."
1,Just plain terrible,"Shoddy code, and screwed up CD production - all based on a framework that's just too complicated.There are better resources out there, even for beginners."
1,Buggy Execution of Good Ideas,The code depends on a sizeable and buggy game framework thatis unsupported.
4,Great guide,I love it! It's useful and well illustrated. I like the tips. Time Out collection is never disappointing. Helped me to discover places a bit out of beaten tracks.
2,An intriguing and ghostly study of modern social thought.,"Although there is something to be said for a catcy title, Myths and Misuses of Darwinism soon vanishes from the reader's mind. As the book is unacceptably skant in both content and innovation, the reader is unable to conjure the meaning of the book. Thus, the reader is forced to delve deep into the phantom pages in order to ascertain the author's argument. At times, however, by way of some supernatural sense, the author is able to express his views to the reader often without actually demonstrating them in the text. Although this book is unable to make a lasting impression, it offers a rare oppurtunity for the reader particpate a he must envision what the author will conclude about Myths and Misuses in Darwinism"
5,Love Ranma,"I love ranma, and i think you will like it too! Just listen to the CD once and you'll love Ranma just like I do,and maybe alittle more! The opening song is my favorite.Its called ""Dont Make Me Wild Like You! "" i'm sure after you hear this CD you will love Ranma! 0_0"
1,Dry and boring,"I purchased this book, just before getting my Pembroke Welsh Corgi puppy. It had absolutely no useful information about the breed, other than ""top dogs"" that have shown well in the ring. Who cares? I wanted to know more about the breed. This did not help."
1,Did not work,"This size will not work if you have a large chest but small nipples as I do.. So it did nothing for me.. I am not using it, so for me it was a waste of money.."
4,They work well...,The size that came with the pump were too small so I had to purchase the larger size. They work as described and I have to issues with them.
2,TOO SMALL...,I would consider my 36 B's to be small to medium sized... so to find that a medium sized breastshield was too small came as a surprise...
2,Not the same fit as the others,"I thought these were the same as the standard Medala shields provided with the pump. They actually clean much better, but seem to fit much tighter, creating a stronger suction which is unnecessary for me."
5,It's so nice to have more parts,I'm so happy that these medela parts came so quick. They have made my constant pumping a little less busy.
4,Larger size was more comfortable,"When I met with a lactation consultant, she recommended the 27 mm (large) breastshields and they do seem to be more comfortable. The biggest advantage to the ""personal fit"" shields vs the softfit is that they can be cleaned in the microsteam bags (for whatever reason, the softfit that comes with the pump can't be cleaned in the medela microsteam bags...stupid). The biggest disadvantage is that the shield isn't as soft/flexible as the standard shield that comes with the pump. The other disadvantage is the price ($12 for a piece of plastic - really??)."
4,Happy,Glad I went ahead and bought the bigger size. I find it much more comfortable and I'm getting more milk
4,Helped a lot!!,"These shields really made the difference for me. I didn't realize there were different sizes and was having a hard time getting any milk when I pumped. I have a bigger chest made even larger by the extra nursing fullness. I did research online about how to get more milk when I pumped, and came across these. I still have problems with them leaking when I pump even when I lean forward. Not sure what the fix is for that but these are a good product. I am getting about 3-4 times as much milk as I was before."
1,"Seller ""MORE BABY STUFF"" selling OPENED BOXES!","The Amazon seller sold me an opened box. this is unsanitary as these are factory sealed for sanitary reasons and now I'm stuck repackaging and shipping it back. Ridiculous! Please don't buy from them! I have already reported them.The product itself I already owned and I can tell you that I'm finding them quite uncomfortable. I've tried the 24mm, 27mm and the 30mm and all have caused me problems with nipple damage. I'm now trying the Pumpinpals shields and while it takes me a couple minutes longer to letdown with them, they are far more comfortable. I recommend buying all sizes. I thought I might use the largest, but I used the middle. Cheers,"
4,Bracelet Buddy,Item received quickly and in excellent shape. Fairly simple to use and compact to carry.
4,"Collect block set,Sq & Hex","The set is very well made and of good quality workmanship. I would give it a five star but, I think it be supplied with a spanner wrench. Still a deal though.Alex"
2,Not the worst movie I've seen...,"But far, far, from the best.Definitely preferred cannonball run and such. Movie was full of bad acting, bad directing, and incredibly contrived scenes. There were a few laughs, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1, but the whole movie was just overall a painful experience... Find a better way to spend some money."
2,Almost...,"I had the unfortunate challenge of continuously comparing Million Dollar Mystery too much with my classic; 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. The plot is almost the same; a bunch of wanna-be rich people looking for money with disastrous and almost predictable consequences and in the end, (you guessed it right), none attaining the initial goal. The difference is that after looking at Million Dollar Mystery, I could not laugh as much as I should and was not excited by the script and acting either. Like some, it fails to take the 'It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World' plot to the 'next'-higher level."
4,intriguing inquiry into popular science in the early nineteenth century,"Valencius explores how early nineteenth-century Americans understood health and the human body, as well as other aspects of the natural world that interested them: climate, topography, agriculture, race. She delves into the work of physicians and other trained observers, but much of her evidence comes from the letters of ordinary settlers in the Mississippi Valley; the result is a fascinating picture of laymen's understanding of basic physiological and environmental phenomena. Valencius's fundamental insight is that there were significant parallels between how early nineteenth-century Americans understood cultivating the land and caring for the human body. They used similar concepts and language to describe both. I found the book somewhat diffuse and repetitive, but that probably reflects the state of scientific understanding at the time. It's a well-written work of scholarship that should be accessible to general readers."
2,Miss Match,Miss Match looks good but bored. I am trying to read it all but I am actually at 1 of less than 150 pages. LOL!!!
1,This book is a BAD try at humor!!!! HATED IT!!!,"Well based on reviews I tried this book, and it was awful!! I really thought it was so supposed to be funny. The author attempted to be funny, but it was like she is trying to hard. It's like talking to someone who wants to fit in and tries to tell jokes. You can tell they are over doing it and instead of laughing you wish you could just shut them up. I kept trying to read on, but it was just over done. The idea of the book was good and I think if the author would have not tried so hard to be funny, it would have been good. I would not recommend this book to anybody who truly likes funny books. There are alot of great, funny books out there and this is not one of them."
1,not very good,"the first pictures u see for the cover is 100% not accurate. i bought this cover because i wanted a metallic blue cover for my sidekick. when i received it, after waiting for 2 weeks, it was definitely not what i thought it was. It was a clear blue case that doesn't even fit my phone. I am not happy at all with this product. Put accurate pictures on what you're selling."
5,Wonderful children's book!,"This is the type of book that, if you were a parent, you would fall in love with it immediately. The first day I only read the first few pages to my five-year-old; but the next day I had to read it completely to him. He said he wouldn't go to sleep until it was finished. The illustrations are excellent and very imaginative. Both, me and my son, loved how the real life characters were portraid as animals by Andrew Toffoli. There is not enough good things to be said about it! Totally recomend it!"
3,Not up to par,"As one who only discovered Beethoven's absolutely sublime Fourth Piano Concerto 18 months ago--after almost 40 years of thinking that his ""Emperor"" was the greatest ever--I hesitate to ""diss"" this recording, but ""diss"" I must. Perhaps it's because I've listened to the Perahia/Haitink version for 18 months (dozens of times), but I find this recording to be heavy, mushy, and not crisp or clear. The orchestra seems mired in the mud. Ashkenazy's playing seems to try to tug the orchestra along, to get it moving faster, to little effect. There is none of the bright, brilliant color of Perahia's playing. Perahia moves along with such exuberant joy.Am I missing something? There's no comparison, in my book. This gets three stars mainly in tribute to Beethoven's unmatched music."
2,Hard to follow even with the CD,The CD jumps around and doesnt follow the book very well. There isnt any warning before the CD moves on and the book would be better if it had phonetic pronunciation in english.
2,Lakhotiya Woglaka Po! - Speak Lakota! Level 1,"I picked this book & CD because I thought it would be easier to learn from since it is set up for elementary school students. In actuality, the set is for teachers of the Lakota language for that age level. It was not very helpful to me personally. Lakota is a very beautiful and complicated language and I realize one needs more than a book & CD to learn from."
3,Good book in general,"Very informative, has some ""quirky"" stories of mishaps in history. Good read, but very dry and hard to swallow in places."
5,Book over Kindle edition,"I purchased the Leonaur paperback edition of this book and found it very enthralling, and a very interesting insight into the dangers, struggles and adventures that pioneers faced in the American Frontier of old."
2,"Happy at first, then the drawer defect hit us","Ours worked well at first and we loved being able to duplicate CDs for use in the car, but after maybe two years of very very very very light use, the recorder drawer refused to open. My subsequent research on the internet revealed that this player is known for this defect. Indescribably annoying. I don't even want to drag it in for repairs because even on the off-chance they do fix it, which in my experience is a rarity, I am quite confident the player will break again due to whatever the design defect is. Stay away! I will never again buy a Philips appliance, and they were formerly a name I trusted."
1,"Nothing more than a frustrating, expensive CD player","If you like being frustrated, aggravated, and throwing your money away, this is the unit for you!I have had my last call to Philips customer support. I am done with them, their company and their products. I have given this unit every chance: I have unplugged this unit hundreds of times; I have tried to finalize CDs that the unit itself burned; and I can sing you the entire song from the Philips customer support hold queue.This unit worked great when I first got it, but it quickly deteriorated. I paid $165 to have it serviced, and that helped problems for a short while. Now, the recorder unit does not even read regular, store-bought CDs: ""insert disc.""Do yourself a favor: stay away from this horrible piece of equipment!"
1,Philips cdr785 3-cd,"Stay away from this recorder, because Philips does not provide technical support. The unit will not let me finalize and keeps giving me an error message ""Update"". I called Philips, but they had no support information. Instead, they referred me to their web site, which, of course had zero technical information. Good bye Philips!"
2,"few japanese/okinawan karate masters, too much US",This book provides little information about japanese and okinawan karate masters and is much to US oriented for a real encyclopedia.
5,"Very,very,very,very,very GOOD!","I am taking isshinryu karate. It has great techinques.Anyway, This book is da bomb! It has alot of information. Every martial artist in the world should have this book. It goes over many styles in the world. Good pictures! You just can't stop reading it once it is in your hands.Big book."
3,Not what I expected,It's not as detailed as I would have liked it to be. The amount of reviewed vocabulary really isn't enough.
2,Not what we were hoping for,"Purchased these both for my car (4runner) and my wife's car (sienna). Taking extra care not to use the wipers when the windshield was dry or icy they started streaking after only a few weeks. On my wife's car the aerodynamics of the blade actually sucked water back onto the windshield on the return stroke, directly in front of the driver's view. I kept trying to remember if it did that before I installed these but wasn't sure. I have since returned to another brand and the problem is gone."
4,good quality wiper,"fit my EX35 without issue. easy to put on. have been holding strong for several months now. Will probably get 1+ years use out of it. I also use rainX after every wash (to help easy the load/lessen the friction of the blades). Oh ya, and as far as wiper blades go . . . these look pretty good! Docked one star for a small streak that they sometimes leave on the drivers side in light rain."
3,ok blade,"I bought this for a replacement wiper on my 2007 Dodge Caliber. Considering it is made by Bosch, I expected superior quality. This blade seemed to work pretty good for maybe the first month. After that, I can say it held up as well as cheaper blades from walmart. I was not very impressed with this product and honestly, would not spend the money on it again."
1,DOES NOT FIT H3,"i bought this for my h3, it said it was for an H3 but it does not fit. dont buy for an h3."
4,Well made for the price,"The hardware is reasonably well made for the price. I am using it on the magazine tube of a 12 ga shotgun and it seems to work pretty well. I rotated the assembly so that the laser is in line with the barrell and the light is slightly off to one side. The pressure switches seem pretty rugged, although they required surprisingly heavy pressure to activate. I have no basis for comparison, but you definitely need to press firmly. The laser seems to be of higher quality than the light, although both function adequately. The light (fixed beam) is the weakest part of the set, although I have not tested the long range effectiveness. It is satisfactory for short range and is better than a mag light. Not sure if a higher quality tactical light could be mounted in the same clamp, since both the light and laser are fairly small in diameter...about .75 in."
3,Light/Laser Combo.,"I first had this unit mounted on a 4x 35mm scope & it worked o.k. I was disapointed that the light wasn't an L.E.D., however, it was reasonably bright. I found having the laser mounted left, or, right of center was not such a good idea. It was also dificult to center the laser being so close to the light. When I installed a 6-24x/50mm scope, I found the laser completely useless as it wouldn't clear the objective lense. I was, however, highly impressed with the quality of the mounting system material. I was equaly impressed with the quality & power of the laser. I think, with a little re-engineering on the mounting system, you would have scored a high 5 with me."
4,No Nonsense Reviews,"As a parent, I found this series extremely helpful. Our daughter ended up at Occidental College and has found the classes and the staff highly attentive and qualified and she loves living in Los Angeles."
4,Fun to Read and Sing,"My one year old son loves this book. It's colorful, interactive and even plays the song."
3,"Pretty good Guide Book, but Lonely Planet's is better...","Right now I am in Beijing with a group from my school. Everybody brought guides, mostly by Frommer's or Lonely Planet. So far I've found that Lonely Planet's guidebook has more accurate locations, prices and recommendations of restaurants and sites than Frommer's, and it is easier to use. Frommer's is an OK guide for extensive descriptions and walking tours, but getting the Lonely planet version will make getting around Beijing and a lot easier and hassle-free."
5,Kid Friendly,"Light-weight GIJoe you can leave your kids alone with. Stong, if corny, anti-drug & pro-environment messages. However, the episode Kindergarten Commandos, where Cobra invades an elementary school is cute, but in light of Newtown maybe taboo for some people."
3,"Its Bad, But must see stuff","Its bad, I can't defend that, the things they do to characters is not good. Poor Hawk is relegated to bumbling comedy relief, others are just drawn badly and you're thankful when characters don't appear as it means they are safe from this terror. BUT, its the only chance you'll have to watch certain characters in action. The Eco Force episodes are a welcome relief as not only are they not butchered, but those are good episodes. And the Cobra & G.I. Joe episodes where they team to fight drugs are just legendary. So overall, its bad, but with just enough redeeming features to make it must see. Damn."
4,thank you Shout factory,"2nd half of the DIC series. Features lots of goofy characters like Night Creepers, flourescent robot vipers, and Storm shadow as a good guy! Should be fun...."
5,"GI JOE 2 and 2, just like Chuck.","Here it is, another review. As you know this is part 2 of the highly excitable series 2 of GI JOE. I'm not a fan of regular things, so it should come as no shock thatI utterly love this series. It's fascinating for many reasons which I won't go into here. But suffice it to say, it's worth your time and money.5 stars. Brilliant all around. Well worth it and worth your time and money. Yo Joe!"
5,Old school fun,"We happened along some of these in a ""flying kit"" with lots of flying objects (paper airplanes, frisbees etc) and these were by far the biggest hit. They are kind of hard to blow up so the bike pump is a must unless you want to asphyxiate yourself blowing them up. My kids especially like the squeeeeallll when you let them go."
5,Fun Baloons!,"They shoot quite high outdoors, and squiggle through thr room indoors. Fun! Most balloons can be resent up multiple times"
2,Very poor quality balloons that dont last,These balloons are very low quality that do not last very long. After one or two uses they explode when being inflated. In many cases they stop making noise which is the main attraction of these. I wouldnt recommend these at all. 90% of ours have already exploded.
2,Rocket balloons malfunction,Was disappointed with these. They would break before we would get them fully inflated. It seemed that almost half the package was defective. But once you get them blown up and flying through the air they make for an awesome affect with great whistling like sounds! Not intended for kids with ultra sensitive hearing!
1,Worse than E. T. and Pac-Man combined!,"E. T. and Pac-Man (for Atari 2600) wre more fun than this game. Yeah, they killed the Atari corporation because they were seen by consumers as the worst video games in history, and who can blame anyone for such a review, but hey at least you didn't have to switch back and forth between two controllers. Whoever decided that they were going to make an atari game that required more user interaction than was possible with 1 controller is an idiot. Period. Wonder why no other game, especially modern games, use more than one controller for a single person at a time? Enough said, save your penny and flush it down the toilet...even if you flood you house that penny was better spent!"
1,Very difficult,Perhaps I do not know how to play this game but did games even come with instruction manuals back then? It has proven to be very difficult and I am still unsure how to play it. You can move from screen to screen with your character but death is inevitable.
5,Dog bowl..??? Cat Bowl!!! ha ha ha,"My last ceramic cat water bowl, froze and broke in January(it rarely freezes in Houston). My cats hated the plastic replacement. This bowl is great!It has a low profile and the blue interior is ""cool"", when filled with water! I really recommend it! WB"
5,How MUCH water?,"HI,I read through all of the helpful reviews. One person even suggested the bowl be a bit taller to hold 'more' water, BUT not 1 review that I noticed, said how MUCH water the bowls hold!I am specifically interested in the 9 1/2 inch largest crock. Does it hold 2 quarts/litres, a whole gallon? can't tell by the specs alone.Just wondering if anyone knows...?Thanks!"
3,Chipped,"Well, I ordered this one and another one identical to this but the 7 and a half incher. This one in particular came chipped. It works still obviously, it was chipped along the top of the rim. I bought it to prevent my cat from tipping his water over. If it wasn't chipped I would have given this 5/5 stars. I am just concerned about the chip though. Is it being chipped like this dangerous for my cat?"
2,not substantial,I ordered 5. One was broken in pieces and 2 others were cracked through the bottom and not useable. The 2 that survived are not what I will keep. The bowls are thin...not what I expected.
5,Attractive Problem Solver...,"My Labbie would empty and then use his steel bowl as a toy in the yard. He would then hide it in the darnedest places. And when I find it, It is caked with dirt packed slobber. I got so tired of having to wash it after every meal. I knew I needed something heavy and not so easy for him to grip, This crock disk was just the thing. He can't pick it up and sling it around like the steel one and it's very easy to clean. But it is heavy, and can be slippery when wet. I've almost dropped it a couple of times. Now I set it flat on a towel on the counter and pat it dry. Great price and would highly recommend this dish to anyone."
4,Much bigger than I expected,"Very good quality bowl and nice colors, but it was much bigger than I expected (I should have looked at a ruler to see how big 9.5 inches is) and the blue color makes it hard to tell if the bowl is empty."
5,as advertised,"Heavy, solid, easy to clean. Everything you would want for Fido, or in my case, Charlie. Same bowls at $12 each at local pet store."
5,I liked the bowl.,This is an excellent food bowl. My dogs took to it right away. It's a nice size for large dogs.
4,Synopsis,"The Wedding book traces the history of nuptial rites and suggests poems, music, and activities to personalize contempory ceremonies."
2,Did not solve the problem,"Wanted to use my old PS2 controller as my PS3 broke and didn't want to shell out $55 for a new one. The 6 axis won't work for any Call of Duty games or any other games that require the use of the 6 axis. Everything else works fine though. Can navigate around using the directional but that's about it. A little disappointed because an earlier review stated it would work which is why I bought it....yeah, it doesn't."
1,Doesn't work well,"I got this for my wife, to used with Dance Dance Revolution. It doesn't work, at all, with the dance pad. It's okay with my old PS1 Dualshock controller, but I didn't try it for very long, since I'm not using it for that. If you have a PS2 compatible PS3, I would suggest the Dance Pad Adapter, by Hyperkin, for use with DDR pads. Though it is more expensive, it will definitely work."
1,Didn't expect much...,"I didn't pay a lot for this, so my expectations weren't high. Still, the USB plug was almost completely rusted over. No way in hell I'd stick that in my computer."
3,Only buy one!,"only one works on a ps3. i bought 2 because i have 2 DDR pads, but the ps3 can only detect one pad at a time. 1 works fine alone, but dont even bother with 2"
1,Did not work - do not buy,"Got this with the hopes of getting my wireless logitech PS2 controller, or wired Sony PS2 controller working with my PS3. The logitech wireless controller did not work at all, and the Sony PS2 controller buttons would all work, but not the two joysticks - making it useless...I am running firmware version 3.7 on a PS3 Slim 160GB. Luckily it was cheap so I'm not too put off wasting less than $4, but I post this review in the hopes of saving someone else the $4. If I could post zero stars I would."
3,Works on most stuff,"We bought the adapters so we can use or two old PS2 controllers (cheaper buying two USB 2.0 extension cables and the adapters then two more $50 a pop PS3 controllers) with our new PS3 -- so we have four controllers. This works fine on everything except our DDR mats. It will only read one of the two matts even though they are both plugged in. Other then this, they work fine on everything else."
1,Not as advertised,"Tried using this device on a PS2/XBOX DDR mat. It worked for the actual controler butons but not for the control arrows on the mat. I made this purchase because it was supposed to work on a DDR mat. This was a waste of money, Had to go out and buy a PS3 DDR mat."
3,Question ...,Does anyone know if these PS2 to PS3 adapters are still functional after the PS3 Firmware Update 3.50(Sept 2010) ?I've read mixed messages on whether or not they still work ...Thank You ...
2,Not completely satisfied,I purchased the adapter for the PS3 with the assumption that it would allow me to use the PS2 guitar for Guitar Hero. I read different articles to ensure that I got the one that would work. This one allows the PS2 guitar to connect but all of the buttons were backward. The Blue operated Green and so on. It works great for a steering wheel and gas pedal but not for the guitar. I broke down and bought a new guitar and game for the PS3. I was told that I could send it back and get a new one. I have sent it back as of yet.
2,Not registering 2/3 of inputs,I am using this for my Taiko Drums to play Taiko Drum master. It seems like I can only get about 1/3 of the hits in. It's possible that the drum is causing the problem that's why I'm giving it 2 stars. Will adjust rating accordingly if it works on other devices.
1,Do not buy for Street Fighter or Guitar Hero,Bought 2 thinking it would be a cheap way not to buy new controllers. I was wrong.
2,Does not work with Guitar Hero controllers,Useless to me because it does not work with guitar hero controllers. Lame. Looks and feels like a piece of junk too.
1,I didnt recive the item and it Keeps bugging me to leave a review,I ordered an Item and never received it. Amazon keeps emailing me to rate and leave a comment . So here it is . Happy'!!!! I would give it no stars but It won't let me so one star it is eventhough they don't deserve it!!
4,Works great!,I was worried about buying this converter because I wasn't sure if it would work but it's totally working fine. I got two new ps3 controllers for $5. Definitely worth getting if you have ps2 controllers lying around.
3,does not work all the time,"some of the buttons work. I am able to use wireless PS2 controller to navigate the menu remotely and play videos. However, not able to play Batman game properly, most buttons don't work."
4,Good adapter,"I don't have any problems with this, it works great with my PS3. Granted I haven't used it with third party controllers like guitar hero, but I know it does everything it advertised with first party ones."
5,Converter works,The converter works as advertised. It is inexpensive. It allowed my son to add another controller to his PS3 system without having to buy a new controller. I recommend this for anyone who wants to use a PS2 controller on a PS3 system.
3,Doesn't work with GT5..,"Ugh it's too bad, I wasted money on this one. I'm writing this review just to warn you people NOT to buy if you're thinking of getting this for GT5. My niece loves to play together on gt4 so when I got GT5 for the ps3 I figured it was time for a new controller and tight on money this was the perfect idea. Nice part is the controller seems to work for ps2 games running through the ps3 just fine and *SOME* ps3 games work 100% but sadly GT5 does NOT work. :'(Looking back I'd just get a official expensive ps3 controller.."
5,An adapter that works?!,"I am very skeptical when it comes to adapters, and I am very familiar with how poorly adapters for various electronics work. However, much to my surprise, these ps2-to-ps3 controller adapters actually work... even with wireless controllers! I have two Logitech wireless ps2 controllers that I just couldn't bring myself to sell, and so I decided to put them to good use and buy adapters so I could have an extra 2 controllers for my ps3. Now, I've got two wireless ps3 controllers, and two wireless ps2 controllers. It works like a charm, and I haven't encountered any problems yet!"
4,nice product,"i was going to buy a second ps3 controller, but saw this adaptor. bought it instead and i must say it works great, just as advertised, saved me a few bucks. (i have a ps3 120gb)"
2,"Only works with standard controller, not guitars!","Although the price is low, be aware that the adapter is fine for most features on the standard PS2 controllers when you wish to play the PS 2 games on your backwards compatible PS3, which we have. But it doesn't work with the DDR mats or the Guitar Hero Guitars.So Yeah for burnout and Kingdom Hearts! Have to keep the DDR in the other room."
1,Dont buy it!,"Product sucks, doesn't work on th PS3, don't waste your money.The buttons work, but the the L3 and R3 do not work, unable to move left, right, up and down."
4,Good Controller Adapter,"This adapter worked perfectly for my intended purposes. I needed a PS1 controller to work with my PS3 and this adapter does the trick. For PS3 games that don't require the Sixaxis technology, it's nice to be able to recycle old hardware with the new system.The only downside is that it didn't work with an old PS2 joystick I had lying around. I couldn't get that to work on my PS3. Fortunately, that's not why I bought this adapter."
4,Works as it should,"pretty simple product, just plug and play. I've been using this on my computer for some of my pc games.The only issue I've had is that games requiring repeated taps(very fast taps)tend not to pick up half the time, however this might not be the adapters fault and could be the game.The only thing I dislike is that the cord is a bit heavy near the USB side and I had to tape the controller cord near the plug on the table so it doesn't fall off and pull/mess up the plug. This is not the adapters fault though mainly a faulty plug design."
1,Does not work,I got this adaptor and found that the L2 and R2 buttons do not work. I tried it with two different controllers and different games. No luck. It is not worth sending it back.
1,Adapter doesn't work for guitar hero!!!,"Go to radio shack and get the ps2 to pc adapter, radio shack's adapter works great with guitar hero & guitar hero 2. Star Power, whammy bar and strum ups work great. Don't waste time and money buying this adapter."
2,Didn't work too well for me.,"Unfortunately, this adapter did not completely work for me. I bought it for the sole purpose of allowing me to play PS2 DDR on my PS3 (I have the old one that is completely backwards compatible). It would not recognize stepping on two arrows at the same time, which is essential for playing DDR. I checked the dance pad on a PS2, and it was not an issue with the dance pad so it had to be the adapter. I was hoping this would work, as another reviewer said it did, but somehow it just didn't completely work for me.Just a note that doesn't contribute to my rating of the product: I e-mailed the seller for a return, BargainCell in my case, but they never replied to me. However, I went through my personal e-mail so I will try again through Amazon. So I still have this adapter that I have no use for and am out $7. EDIT: The seller eventually e-mailed me back and refunded me even though I thought it was too late."
1,Didn't work AT ALL,"I purchased this product hoping to get some re-use out of my old ps2 controllers...I was gravely disappointed.First of all, the product came in just an envelope with no wrapping whatsoever. It seemed like it was a stolen and resold...Secondly, I tried this (which btw does not look anything like the picture) on both my wireless Logitech AND my wired original sony controllers and it never worked.Lastly, I tried to contact the company to have them resolve this. I have never heard back from them. They literally robbed me. BUYER BEWARE and do not purchase this product or any from this seller. You will be ripped off."
5,it works...,"works just fine, even perfectly. The thing i must express though, is that this is NOT a replacement for your original ps3 controller but a secondary one, or a backup at most. i have not tried this with anything other than a regular ps2 control."
3,Please Read,well i got this for ps2 controller for the ps3. works great but one problem. i was hoping i could get the world tour ps2 guitar to play on warriors of rock. works but not all the buttons work right. mapping is way off. do not get this for the ps3 if your hoping for a guitar from ps2 to work on the ps3
1,Didn't work,I tried to play NBA 2k11 with this thing and the controller lit up so I thought I was good but everytime I pushed a button nothing happened. Glad I wasted my money.
2,Its ok,"It served its purpose until I could buy a real 360 controller to use on my laptop to play some pc games(indigo prophecy,jade empire,halo 2, and etc). It was really good on certain games like pyschonauts."
2,not so satisfied,"I have a new ps3 (160 GB) and i don't have any problems using this adapter to navigate the ps3 menu, however, I wanted to play ratchet and clank all 4 one (a 4 player game) so i got this since i have a bunch of ps2 controllers lying around. Much to my dismay, you need to press the ""PS"" button to play this game, and this controller does not offer than function. some other models do, but not this one. If you are playing older games, or watching movies, fine, but this is not a substitute for the real thing. I'm not very happy with it, but it was only a couple bucks, so I'm not that mad."
4,Does what it's supposed to!,"Turned my old PSX/PS2 mini fightstick into a PS3 compatible fight stick. The only things I'm missing is force feedback and a ""Home"" button...but that's my fightstick's fault. Response times for Super Street Fighter IV seem pretty good, because I can still pull off the few combos I know (I'm not great yet haha so I can't comment as if I played with crazy tournament worthy skills). Worth the $$ since it wasn't very much at all!"
3,it gets the job done,it works w/ my streetfighter arcade fight stick for my ps2 on tekken6 as long as you press start and select at the same time as pressing the direction stick at an angle to get the ps3 to recognise it
1,AAARRRGGGG,Maybe I got a dud but this adaptor NEVER worked for me. I got it to play my guitar hero with my ps3 and it doesnt work. It doesnt work on any game I have and I went through them all. Guess I'm stuck playing guitar hero on the ps2. :(
1,Camera,"Buy something else this is not worth no money or the time..I found some other cameras at the big A that work great,think I aready reviewed them but if not I will get there,always Glenn..."
4,good,this is good and looks aggressive. I would only recommend it be used with simple modifications. The top sits way to high and limits the use throttle spacers and intake manifold spacer you can use with a stock hood. Other manufactures offer more style and same air flow at a lower price with better hood clearance. plus K&n oiled filters foul up sensors and dirty intake manifold. But still and good product and its K&N.
5,Awesome sound!,"This driver has awesome sound. Also the build quality is immediately apparent. I installed it in a Carvin 12"" powered floor monitor, 400 watt, and it vastly improved the sound quality."
3,The Joy of Bleak,"Well-written novel. Language beautiful, arresting and succinct. This is the book's main attraction. The activity (there is no plot) depends a lot on the fact of the war in the North of Ireland being of interest in itself, which it isn't necessarily. The characters caught within the hopelessness of their social and political milieu are solid, young, and even passionate in an odd way, if passion can have a negative value. In a world of tranquillising mush that often passes for fiction, the strength of this work is in its tonal bleakness."
5,Ahhhhh!,I love the Healing Garden products. The zzzTherapy Pillow & Room Spray isn't just for the bedroom in our home. We have a pooch who likes to rearrange the cushions on the furniture for her sleeping pleasure. Having a delightfully scented spray that is safe for fabric is a real plus. Pooch smells better too!!
2,Don't bother,"It came with the wrong timer... thus dispensing 0.5 cups of food at a time... way too much for my cat. If you decide to get it, make sure you get a timer with a ""seconds"" option so, in theory, you can actually control intake. However... don't count on it for a cat... within 5 minutes of opening it my cat had figured out how to dislodge the food cap and get into the area where it comes out. This, in part, was due to the see-through storage container and the gap that enabled him to smell his way to food. This enabled him to get to twice as much food as he should have. Also- the system does not give a sealed storage area... thus leaving it wide open to bugs."
4,Gotta Love Purple!!,"I love this comfortable shoe. I have received many compliments on the style and color of this shoe. It's the new fall color in clothes, too! The sales staff at Liz Claiborne loved the color to match their clothes."
2,Somewhat agree with first reviewer,"""American Dream"" is a big waste of time for a play, with overly simplistic names for characters, and a plot that makes very little sense. ""death of Bessie Smith"" is only slightly better, and ""Fam and Yam"" is just a bitter author's take on the ""establishment"" which sounds childish."
1,Dont even think of buying this book,"I read this book in my high school English class; I found it to be mindless obscenities from drunken characters. I believe Albee has written wonderful plays (Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) but this is not one. Here is an idea, don't buy this book, save your money, go to Burger King and observe the dull lifelessness of the teenagers working there. I believe you will get the effect that this book is trying to make."
1,Not for Mac,I bought this version of Majesty because I love this game but I have a Mac now. This version said it was for Mac but when it arrived it only works for Windows!!! =(
3,Ok food set,"This food set is nothing spectacular.My daughter did like it only because she likes chuck e cheese.The food is not very good quality and everything is taped toghether including the paper items so when you take the tape off it peels parts of the labels off.The set includes:4 party masks4party blowers4 cardboard crowns4 place settingspizza,soda,juice,chicken wings,cheese sticks,french fries and a birthday cake with removable candles and decorations(be careful when removing the decorations from the packaging since they are taped on can easily break the pegs holding into place!)I gave this set a 3 because it is a very good idea but not very well made."
4,Beautiful,These shades are a elegant looking rich brown a little trouble in figuring out how to hang them. Happy with them anyway
1,Useless for inexperienced,"It is impossible to get any kind of abdominal workout with this video unless you are very experienced using the swiss ball.You may spend so much time attempting to get balanced, positioned and then falling off the ball while the video moves on to the next segment that your abs will not get a workout.I cannot believe none of the previous reviewers commented on how difficult it is to just stay on the ball using the positions demonstrated.There is no instruction or tips on positioning or balancing on the ball. After a lengthy warmup, the video just jumps into a routine that many will find impossible to follow along with.Waste of money unless you are already highly-experienced and highly skilled using the swiss ball or have hours and weeks to practice."
3,GGW Canada,Just another mild GGW offering. A lot of flashing but nothing real hot. About a year ago this title was up for grabs for $40. I don't know whether it sold or not but I would call a $10 price as an upper limit.
4,Perfect little pot!,"Although I expected this to be bigger than it is, I use it for everything now. Rice? Oatmeal? Soup? It's just big enough. Now, I plan to buy more of them."
2,No confidence in temperature output,"Thermometer was much flimsier than I expected. Also, the temperature depends upon expansion and contraction of an inexpensive coil. My coil was slightly distorted upon arrival and I had to squash and unsquash it until it gave reasonably accurate readings, but I discovered that the readings were off at much higher or lower temperatures. I just have no faith in what this thermometer says and I intend to replace it. It DOES look good and it gives ballpark thermometer readings (plus or minus 10 degrees?)."
4,Bob-Dig Lift,"Can one ever have enough of Bob? Not in this household! More of the exciting stories featuring lofty and the gang. Teaching work ethic, good relationships and sharing. A wholesome alternative to other junk out there that isn't fit to watch. Toddlers and pre-school age children are always excited about Bob!"
4,Nice cartoon for kid.,"My son (2 years)like Bob the builder, I like it, too. In this dvd, I like ""Dizzy's Crazy Paving"" the most."
2,More self-indulgence from the me generation,"Does anyone really need to read more fatuous cries for attention like this? The song being sung here is ""Oh, please, I have troubles, pay attention to me."" Then the discordant refrain kicks in: ""I'm so helpless, buy my book so I can I tell you how helpless I am, and I'll tell you about all the other people who can't cope.""But it's the constant background whining of Barber's chorus that sounds the most unoriginal note, and is so embarassingly out of tune. Do we really need to feel sorry for yet another spoiled little rich kid complaining about how the everyday challenges of life were, and are, and always will be, just so, so, very difficult for sensitive little twits like him? Moreover, does anyone need to listen to immature moans posing as songs? It's likely the ""American Idol"" tryouts fulfill that particular need, or ""empty chasm of emotional isolation,"" as they intone in the world of pseudo-psychological cliches."
1,Singing the same old tune,"This book is little more than an embarassing catharsis from an author for whom no amount of privileged education succeeded in helping him to grow up. It surely reaffirms my own conviction that mental health professionals should continue in the direction of treating their work more as science and less as the virtually worthless ""sympathetic listening"" currently being peddaled as ""social work.""Mental disease deserves an informed, medical, scientific approach, not inane pop culture ""I'm getting OK- you're getting OK"" babble from people who can't deal their own demons, much less help others to deal with theirs.Mr. Barber's approach of sponging off of the troubles of others in order to feel better about his own inadequacies does little to help either side of the exchange. Don't bother reading this book unless you enjoy listening to someone feel sorry for himself. It's written by someone who been feeling sorry for himself his whole life, and he's singing the same old tune."
5,"Psychology and Life - One of the best ""intro"" books","I have about 30 introductory psychology books on my shelf, and none is more dog-eared and appreciated than this latest edition by Zimbardo and Gerrig. The breadth of coverage is astonishing, and they do so without sacrificing depth - several of the chapters (such as the outstanding ones on sensation and perception) are rigorous enough even for a graduate course in cognition.The style is eminently readable and still manages to cover all the important points. This is one of the best selling textbooks in the field of psychology with a long history of satisfied students and instructors, and this is no accident."
5,Polly Pockets Puppy Parade- w/ little case,"My daughter loves Polly Pockets, and she wanted 'all the sets' for Christmas. Knowing I couldn't buy all the sets, since she loves animals, I decided to buy a lot of the animal sets...thus this one, The Puppy Parade, was so appropriate! My daughter who is 8 loves it! It came with little dog leashes and dog bowls and everything....she loves it, even her 3 year old brother plays with them! The whole process of buying, shipping, and the product was great! And I love the little case it came in, to keep the peices in!"
3,Polly Pockets,"My 3 and 4 year old grankids like this toy, however the case it came in could be more durable.Girls like the toy, however mom and grandmom do not like picking up all the tiny tiny pieces....so if you have a crawling baby, think twice before you buy this toy."
3,"Smells nice, BUT...","Smells wonderful, BUT...it ""spread"" onto my clothes and made an awful mess. Probably won't buy this product again, as there are more practical (and less expensive) products for ""hair freshening"" available."
3,"smells weird, but it works","It needs to be really thoroughly brushed out of your hair after application- I have very dark hair so this product leaves it's mark if not brushed through. It smells weird. I can't quite place it, it's not bad, it's just not what I want my hair to smell like."
2,"almost great, but not really","Cake Beauty Satin Sugar is not for dark hair. The darkest shade I would use this on is a medium to light auburn. It's a reasonably dark tan color... if it were powder makeup. On my dark brown hair, it made my locks look dull and well, coated with something lighter brown. Now that my hair's back to natural black, I'm definitely not using this anymore. *sigh*"
1,wtf,Just received this and cannot get it to open so the powder will sprinkle out the top...maybe it's defective? Also opened it up and saw that the tiny little container is only HALF full of powder. It's a shame they waste all that packaging material to make this product look more substantial than it is. It smells delicious but definitely not worth the money for what you get.
3,Messy but does the job,"I am a dry shampoo fan.I have used almost all of them out in the market from sprays to powders. I have brown highlighted oily hair and need to wash daily. Dry shampoos allow me to skip a day of washing my hair. I have used this brand for about 4 weeks. This product is a bit messy to apply. I get no control with the dispenser-- I actually prefer Stila's dry shampoo's dispense top. I have been experimenting with how to best apply. Shaking directly onto the roots soaks up all the oil and grease, but gives my hair a dull,whitish cast. I found it works best by shaking it into hands first then running it into your roots. However, with the second method I still have been having a hard time finding a balance between getting rid of all the oil/grease versus the dull, whitish cast. Also, be sure to wash your hands before touching your clothing (especially dark clothing) or else you'll have brown splotches (easily removed in the wash). I will not likely re-purchase."
1,Cake Beauty Hair Powder,"Rather than refresh and de-grease, my hair looked dull and felt dirty. I was very disappointed with this product."
1,Looked like cinnamon in my hair,"I am a total dry shampoo girl and wanted to give this a go. Unfortunately I was not pleased. It turned a cinnamon like color and you could see it in my part as if my scalp was a tan color so very obvious. I can barely dust this on and it still gives that effect. It also didn't add any volume or make my hair feel clean. I won't repurchase. The spray dry shampoos are just better. Period. (On a side note, I recommend Pssst dry shampoo-smells like coconut and never leaves residue in my dark hair, also very inexpensive and can be found at Ulta)"
4,It's OK.,"It's not brown enough for dark brown hair. I hoped it would be but it's not. It's better than white though! I sprinkle this on a large face brush and brush it into my hair, like you would put powder on your face. Easy application, no spills. It's nice, but with my dark hair, it's not a repurchase for me."
3,Cheeply made,Product is not well made at all - the pins were bent and had to straighten them prior to use
3,Expensive Genealogy book,Very expensive book for family research. Great condition. Complete data. Good complete data source as intended...
3,It's okay,The fragrance and color seem a bit different than my first purchase of the lotion in a local retail store.
5,Love it,I love this lotion because it smells incredible (the scent is soothing) and always softens my hands when they're getting a little dry.
2,in no way is it like the product i was trying to match that i';ve been using....no effect at all,would not recommend this product to anyone trying to get the same results from original healing garden zzzsprayhas unpleasant aroma
3,A Stonishing Performance that Worth a Remastered Edition.,"A have this video originally in laserdisc format, and for a laserdisc, is a breathtaking recording in audio and image of one the best Rolling Stones tours, but for a DVD, the quality of the recording is above other issues from the same band originally released in DVD. The screen format is PAN-SCAN. The sound is Dolby-D 5.1 and 2.0, with no subtitles, but good. I just figure with the new technologies of digital remastering how wonderfull this video should be.I don not know if there are other superior editions from the same recording, but if You are Rolling Stones fan, You have to own this show.Paulo Vitor."
4,Get It While You Can YOU NEED IT!,"More white-hot rock and roll from Scott Morgan and crew. Scott has been especially active in the last few years, having gotten together with Deniz Tek from Radio Birdman for a couple of projects. He's also teamed with The Hellacopters and has formed three bands: Hydromatics, Powertrane and The Solution. The Hydromatics perform High Energy originals and covers of GREAT Sonic's Rendezvous band tunes (many you can hear on this one-off conglomeration ""Three Assasins"". Scott is the perfect man to cover the SRB material, as he was up front sharing the spotlight with Fred ""Sonic"" Smith in the SRB!This will eb a rare CD and it many not be the BEST of Scotts work in the last few years, it still outshines 99% of all CD's released in the last decade.GOod Stuff. Try to find the Hydromatics CD's and you'll have the best Scott Morgan has to offer these days."
2,Flimsy at best,"We were l looking for a good transitional seat for my 3 year old daughter who is not heavy enough for a booster but had outgrown her car seat. This seat has higher harness positions for older kids with a 5 point harness, but these were the only features we liked. The seat overall felt very flimsy, the arm rests feel like they could snap off very easily especially if a child were to sit on them. The removable seat pad makes it next to impossible for our daughter to sit up straight, she slides down until the buckle is tight against her crotch. The head rest, while it does adjust, doesn't provide adequate head support for kids who sleep in the car, our daughter was flopping all over the place.Maybe we feel this way because we started out with the Britax Roundabout(which we highly recommend!) I guess we should have just stuck with a trusted brand, we will be returning our Evenflo."
2,Only lasted a month with my toddler!,"I did a lot of comparison shopping. I tried out several boosters and decided on this one based on the comfort and safety features. I thought the armrests were neat and liked the recline feature. However, after not even a month with this seat, my toddler managed to completely remove one of the armrests!!! I looked back and he had it in his hand playing with it. I couldn't figure out how to reassemble it at all. Not only that, the pillow tore when my son played with the tags on it. I will say it did seem VERY comfortable for my son. He never squirmed or acted like anything was bothering him. But due to the items falling apart or tearing on it, I would definitely recommend you keep shopping if you want something that will withstand rough toddlers. I bought a different brand, but similar seat with NO armrests as a replacement."
2,Did not fit,"I ordered this vehicle speed sensor for 1999 Mercury Villager. Amazon.com webpage said it would fit but sensor that was shipped was, physically, smaller in diameter and would fit into transmission."
3,Needs something more...,"While the review questions in this book are very comprehensive, the rationals for the answers are not supplied. Instead, a page number next to the answer is supplied, but it doesn't actually match up with that page in the book. There must be some other book that goes with this, but I sure couldn't figure out what book it was. It's difficult to test yourself when you can't find the rational for your answers. I know that I learn and retain information better when I know the reason why something is done. I therefore would recommend that it someone knows what the companion book is, please list it on this site!!"
3,Citronella - Hem incense sticks,"The sticks were of varying sizes, some skinny, some thicker. They burned very fast. Use to have another brand, no longer makes them, but in comparison, these do not match up. Your fingers get black when handling them, but washes off."
4,Smell great,Smell great. Can't wait to use these in the yard when it gets to be warm enough. Purchased to be mosquito deterrents. Hoping it works.
2,bug sticks,"very thin and shorted lived. incense works as well ,lasts longer ,and no shipping charges"
4,An Introduction to International Law,"Good reference to any International Law text. It reviews all the details that have to be read between the lines in Law School texts. It also mentions all key cases reviewing them in a one or two paragraphs format, straight to the point.I recommend it as a second reference to International Law: Cases and Materials/ Janis (West)"
1,Very Disappointed,"Expected 2003 revised edition, received 1988 original edition - copy moldy, cannot read. Also emailed seller - never received a response."
5,Great book for bowhunters,"This is a great book. It is a biography about Chuck Adams and his quest to take all 27 big game animals in North America with a bow and arrow. The book is a little slow at times but overall a great read. Don't look for any bowhunting advice in this book, you won't find it. This book is all about the life of Chuck Adams and his dedicating his life to perfecting the art of bowhunting."
5,Life at Full Draw,"Very good book for the hunter in the off-season. Putting the reader in the shoes of Adams though his amazing, and sometimes frightening achievements (such as hunting a polar bear with a bow and arrow). IMO, the first half is way better than the second half. It got a little too ""political"" about the public opinion of Adam's achievements. Regardless I recommend this book for anyone interested in the challenge of bowhunting. If you are not a bowhunter, this book will still be interesting if you enjoy the story of a man who chased his dreams to the fullest extent by achieving the first archery Super Slam."
3,not too bad,"Honestly, I expect more hunting tales and less personal information. I didn't read the final third of the book because it is all about personal thoughts, issues and stuff not about hunting. I know Chuck is a great hunter and that many people are jealous of that, but I wanted to be a better hunter at the end of this book and I am not sure if that happened. Maybe I should have read ""Super Slam"" to hear more hunting stories. If you want to know more about Chuck and his personal conflicts and beliefs, then this is a good book. If not, buy something else."
3,Interesting Discussion but poor Presentation,"The first thing that struck me was the large number of typo's.Starting with page 4: ""when we does development abroad help""and on through the rest of the book. Also, the graphics appearcrude.In part 1, I could not find any reference to the fact that""free"" trade does not exist in the real world. Countries usetariffs, taxes, subsidies, etc. to further their own interests."
4,THis stuff is like magic,"I can't sit here and write that this product has made me smarter, however it has increased my mental clarity to the point that my performance at work has taken a turn for the better, so much so I have earned a higher position and pay raise. Could I have done it alone, I'd like to believe so, however I will continue to use Neurovar."
5,Neurovar has worked wonders on my career,My job requires alot of intelligent thinking. And for a little while i havent been working up to my potential. I have been forgeting important info that my clients have been giving me. since i have started on this wonderful product i have been superb at work . and i will continue to order this producct
1,DECEPTIVE REVIEWS,"I was all ready to order this product just from skimming the good reviews that it had. However, a little deeper digging alerted me to the fact that all of the reviewers except two have ONLY REVIEWED THIS PRODUCT. Why is that? Because they are all false reviews made by the manufacturers, that's why. And the two reviewers that had more than the one review reviewed other prodcuts that are probably prodcuts from the same manufacturer.This could be the best product in the world but I wouldn't buy it because of the BLATANTLY OBVIOUS COVERT AND DISHONEST MARKETING TECHNIQUES USED."
3,I wish I found Neurovar sooner,Neurovar has really had a positive effect on my clarity. I feel I have had trouble focusing since my menopause and this has really helped me to do so. I am always skeptical of supplements but I felt confortable with this one because 2 nurses over where I do aide work at both recommended it to me. So if I had only found this sooner before I took the other remedies I would have saved alot of money. I like it and will continue to take it.
4,I feel Neurovar has helped my concentration,I am in my first year in college and needed all the help I can get and let me tell you Neurovar really works! My concentration definately improved!
3,Makes studying easier,So far I've been using Neurovar for 2 weeks and I immediately saw I was able to study more efficiently for my exams. My grades have been easier to maintain.
1,Bogus reviews,As of 10/13/08 most reviews have 100% helpfulness. This is where I come to get people's true feelings for a product. NO product gets 100 helpfulness on people's comments. Manufacturer is tainting reviews. WILL NOT BUY.
5,my DreamPhone,"I first tried a Motorola V330 only to return it because my calls would be cut-off and reception was always low. Someone at the store recommended this phone and I couldn't be more grateful. It works like a dream. My voice conversations are crystal clear and the phone is packed with plenty of features, i.e. the side color lights would blink when there is a new message or a missed call, even in silent mode, so awesome. It is friendly and so customizable, you have tons of options as far as cases and side light colors. I hooked it up to my PC with a DKU-5 cable within minutes to load screensavers, contacts, calendar items, I can connect to Yahoo Mssgr/ or AOL chat right away, etc etc..."
3,It's a phone,"I loved this thing when I got it a year ago. Since then the weird stuff covering the lights on the side has peeled off. It was really gross. Never touch it, all four of them peeled off slowly, and I'm sure that's not good. It decides when it wants to ring and not and what ringer it wants to use and not use. No matter how many times I go and change my ringer sometimes it will use that default T-mobile one. Other than those complaints it's a great phone. I love Nokia, it was cheap, and it works."
3,not what i was hoping for (actually more like a 2.5/5),"I like the look of the phone. I like the size, shape, and weight of the phone. I like that it is not a flip phone.I do not like the navigational/menu button. I strongly do not like the menu system. Sometimes it automatically takes me out of the menu when I don't want to leave the menu. THE CAMERA DOES NOT HAVE A ZOOM FUNCTION. Annoyingly, whenever I send a picture to my tmobile album, I get a message sent back saying that it sent. There is no way to display the time on the phone's main screen. There is no way to automatically select what I want from the menu (on my Sony Ericsson, 1 corresponded to the top left, 9 to the bottom right, etc.)."
4,"Cute, useful, light, but no show stopper...","In what appears to be an attempt to emulate the popularity and customizability of the 5190 in the past, Nokia is branding the 3220 as a hip phone for youngsters. Regardless of how that makes you feel, it's useful. Although the menu graphics are somewhat disappointing, the phone's operating system is stable and fast. The phone itself is very small, smaller than the average Sony Ericcson small. It comes with a mobile internet browser, supports ICQ, AIM, and Y! instant messengers, and comes standard with a handful of java games. Aside from that, there is a vast array of Java applications you can buy to add to the phone. I switched to this phone from the Sidekick I color. I am relieved not to be carrying a phone the size of a large bar of soap in my pocket. I reccommend this product for people who want a visibly attractive, light phone that can handle the basics flawlessly and occaisionally do other things."
5,Nice phone.,"This phone is suprising me. I returned the Motorola V188 that I had bought from amazon because it had problems and was a bad phone.Loud speaker phone.Great call clarity.Lights are great when ringer is turned off.MP3 ringtones would be nice but hey its a phone and it makes calls.Battery life seems decent.......not great, decent.Camera takes ok pictures and video.Good solid basic phone.You can have the time display on the home screen you simply have to set it to do so...in regards to the previous post."
4,A decent phone,"I bought this phone with tmobile service from amazon couple weeks ago. I wanted simple, compact phone with easy to use interface and this nokia phone is almost exactly fits that description. I am a bit unhappy about graphical interface (sony ericsson phones are prettier) but gui is still good, especially when compared to Motorola. Few complains: small center button, the display does not show alarm time, unlock screen lingers a second too long after keys are unlocked, etc... but all of complaints are minor. I just wish cellphone makers learn how to design intuitive and easy interfaces (this would be a great open source project, similar to kde:-). Overall, this phone is good at making calls and that is all I care about."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE,"This phone has 2 good features, slightly better reception and slightly better impact resistance. Aprt from that, everything elase sucks....BIG TIME..I am a Techie and I found this phone so annoying to use...The Data software (PC Suite) is a piece of s hit, there is not milder word for it....please do yourself a favor and buy something else....Nokia sucks in User Interface...they are better in reception, but these days the networks are strong enough, especially if you dont live in a remote area you will find yourself happier with another phone.I want to give it 0 stars but that option is not available"
2,Sending back our second 3220 to Tmob,My daughter likes the phone but the ringer quit on the first two phones. Here's hoping the third one works. Tmobile is great on returns though.
1,PROBLEM:Headset icon appears after a few days,Please DO NOT buy this set!After a few days of use the phone thinks that the headset is connected and after that you either have to get a replacement set or use the headset.I have already got 2 replacements sets from TMobile.It is useless. The replacement sets show the headset icon too and then you can not hear anybody!
2,Piece of crap.,"Why is Nokia still producing ""high end"" camera phones without built-in bluetooth? Because people who don't know better continue to buy them anyway. Can you imagine buying a plasma television without a remote control? This phone is lacking in memory and UI design as well. I guess the clear scrapbooking arts & craft window in the back cover is supposed to make up for all the shortcomings? Come on, Nokia. No wonder you guys are losing market share to Samsung."
2,Nice but not practical,"This is my third cell phone. First time with t-mobile and first non flip phone. As soon as I got the phone I put the black cover on it. It looks a lot better, but it still looks kiddish. After using this phone, I would prefer a flip phone. Since it's easy to press buttons in your pocket, I have the lock feature on. So every time I need to make a call, I have to press the menu button then star. This gets quite annoying since its easy to miss the menu button. This phone is nice but it just may not cut it some.PRO: Good reception, durable.CON: Feminine or kiddish looking phone.Navgating the phone is hard.The middle menu button is almost impossible to presscorrectly with out hitting another key.Phone may be too small for some."
4,Not too much about Bagger Vance but great bk on the Gita,"This book gives a relaxed and informative treatment of the essential doctrine of the Bhagavad Gita. If you're too lazy to read the Penguin Classic translation of the Bhagavad Gita, get this. Knowledge is the first step to enlightenment!"
1,Another Krishna Consciousness interpretation,The Legend of Bagger Vance is one of my favorite books and I have spent a fair amount of time studying the Gita including reading portions of it in Sanskrit. I picked up Gita on the Green with high expectations but was quickly disappointed when I realized that it was written from the Krishna Consciousness perspective (A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada's Bhagavad Gita As It Is).I would recommend the Stoler-Miller translation of the Gita.
1,The Picture is Deceiving,"Beware, the plant you get (when you finally get it) looks nothing like the picture they show. It is actually about the size of one branch of the tree pictured. Also, the shipping info they provide is totally inaccurate."
5,Fantasies Can Come True,"This is part of the Fantasies, Inc. continuity series, and it's a winner! The hero, Tony, is at once both vulnerable and strong. After a debilitating injury, he wants to return to the role of a hero (he was a firefighter), and goes to Fantasies, Inc, to be able to be a hero once more. At night he's in disguise, the dashing rescuer of the island, and the man of Kyra's fantasies.Watch out for this one. It's a hot read!!!"
5,"Best tasting, easiest to mix","The title about says it all. My wife and I have been using this product for more than 4 years. We are hooked on the strawberry flavor and only use that. Mix it with a cereal with dried fruit and it's a tropical meal. No lumps when mixing, no problems swallowing, great flavor. We have it every day for breakfast, or a mid-day snack. We always mix it with no-fat milk. Mmmmm."
1,poor quality,"Interesting concept, but the quality of these things is ridiculously poor. I've found shop towels from the dollar store that are better made."
2,Naturade Soy Free Veg Protein Booster,"This is for the hardier consumer, taste wise. If you don't mind the flavor of powdered peas, this one is for you. Good texture, good dissolvability. Price is what you would expect--no bargain but not a killer. There is, however, most definitely the flavor of peas there, and nothing really covers it up. I like peas when they are green and I have to chase them around on my plate. In the form of a vanilla, or chocolate, or coffee, or banana, or blackberry, etc., etc. drink?--naw."
5,good stuff for SoyFree Protein,"I do like this protein shake, but I admit it's not the best tasting protein powder by itself. I find that anything that's soy or Whey free is not as tasty at first but I simply add Stevia extract to it and it works out great. It's very low calorie and high protein. I use this and Hemp Powder for variety and mix in some fruits along with it. I think it's the right way to go for the simplicity of a protein source that doesn't have any health negatives to it. Simply add a bit of stevia and you're all set."
4,Taste Terrible,I choose this rating simply because the protein source is really good but the taste I can barely choke it down still going to try different ways to mix it. The taste is awful and gritty tasting. But like I said this is an excellent source of protein!
4,Kind of a life-saver,"I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and being a vegetarian, tofu and eggs were my only pure-protein options and I grew sick of those very soon. Discovered this protein powder and have been using it in my cooking ever since. I have added it to soups, stews, curries and smoothies. I am yet to try making rotis with it. I prefer it cooked in my meal than in smoothies. It is better used with something that already has an overpowering taste. The product's website says it CAN be used in cooking, so I assume the nutrient value is not lost by doing so.I think it is a little high on sodium, but atleast it gives me more options in my food now. I have not tried any other protein powders, so I don't know how it rates compared to others in the market taste-wise."
5,Great product.,"Great for skin and muscles. I blend it with skim milk and sometimes a flavoring, although it is great with just milk. I will keep this product in my eating regimen. It helps to tighten my scalp. My hair doesn't fall out like it was before I started drinking this vegetable protein."
2,The Lonely Planet is getting lazy in Vietnam.,"In comparision with the older versions of the Lonely Planet Vietnam guides, the latest one (April 2001), does not add much. Bit of a lazy job if you ask me. Perhaps this has to do with the fact that LP insists on recruiting writers who have been 'slot machine repairmen', 'rodeo riders' and 'monkey keepers'. This probably to enforce the idea that a multi-media multinational company can still harbour and, moreover sell a hippy/backpacker image and that you and I may benefit from their 'bohemian' inclinations. Problem is that most 'rodeo riders' stay in the saddle for a couple of seconds only. The (co)-author of the 6th edition of the LP/Vietnam falls into this category. Notwithstanding the editors' attempts to portrait our wild west friend as 'quite a character', a gifted writer on Vietnam he is most certainly not. Disappointing and not worth the additional expense. Perhaps have a look at the Rough Guide on Vietnam first."
3,Interesting to read but also ask around for information,"The section on hill tribes were interesting but more coverage on Danang (it's historical background and marble mountains) would have been helpful. The information on Hanoi was not comprehensive; we thought the Youth Hotel was a good deal even though it was not particularly recommended in the guide; but it does have useful email addresses of tour companies and they reply quite promptly with prices and package information. It is actually a much better armchair travelling guide than Fodor's Vietnam guide but the Fodor's guide has some excursions not listed in the Lonely Planet and is systematic. Lonely Planet also has a Hanoi guide with maps, helpful if the cyclo driver is travelling in the wrong direction."
1,Not needed,Great idea for a book but it really isn't needed. You can find most tourist stops on the internet now...and most people speak enough English you can get around okay.
5,A Must Have Guidebook When In Vietnam!,"I recently spent about 3 weeks in Vietnam. It was a great trip and I highly recommend visiting Vietnam to anyone who enjoys travelling in Asia.With that said, I feel that during a trip to Vietnam, the Lonely Planet book is absolutely one of the most important books to have, to read before you go, to look at while you are there, and to reflect back upon when you get home.The book was great. It was so good, that I was constantly passing it up and down the bus to other people on the trip. Everyone used it, and to my surprize there were some people that had never used a Lonely Planet book. LP is the best, and they have never let me down. There Vietnam book is no exception.If you are going to Vietnam, buy and use this book.It is a great purchase."
1,Look somewhere else,"I travelled to Vietnam in Sept/99 and unfortunately was loaned this LP handbook so thought I would take advantage and use it. I was as usual disappointed with the type and presentation of the information provided. I grew tired of all the commentary in the book and so much so that it is difficult to select the facts. For example, instead of providing factual information on transport, hotels, etc., the book is filled with tidbits which are essentially useless for everyday travelling and end up being conversation between a bunch of backpackers in the travel cafe. This LP handbook has managed to dominate the minds of all travellers to Vietnam and, as in my case, I found everyone reading it and complaining, but they had no other option. I hope travellers to Vietnam can find some other guidebook so they do not follow the all to well beaten track through Vietnam as so many other backpackers do and perhaps may discover some things on their own."
2,A victim of its own popularity,"LP Vietnam, as several others have mentioned, is misleading and out of date. But even worst, is that it tries to scare most travelers into following its suggested itinerary instead of venturing out on their own. I was going to outline some of the more glaring mistakes, but other reviews beat me to the punch.In defense of LP, who have produced decent guidebooks in the past, Vietnam may be changing at such a fast pace that as soon as it was published much of the information was already out of date. However, not all the mistakes can be blamed on a country in the throws of rapid changes and as such as easily dismissed.Hopefully the next edition will have greatly improved and won't be written in such an amateurish way. However, I think I'll pass and try the Rough Guide or take my chances without a guidebook! What a novel idea..."
3,No pictures!,"Listen, this may be a completely nitpicky thing but this book has no pictures of the recipes. I HATE when cookbooks have no pictures and after speaking with some folks online I found I am not alone. The recipes ""sound"" good and we made two of them and they were okay. But there is more to the eating experience besides tasing, the visual is important. I also learn a lot from recipe pictures insofar as how to arrange the dish and to help to ""see"" if I have done things correctly, which is also part of the learning experience of cooking.So, I am not saying this is a bad book (I would have to complete more recipes in it) but without pictures it just is not my thing. So I am hoping this may help someone else who feels the way I do."
3,...But where's the adapter?,"I have wanted a Casio keyboard since childhood. I purchased one yesterday and had to go to Radio Shack for the adapter. The sales girl spent over an hour trying different adapters, nothing in the store worked on the Casio CTK 700. I ended up buying batteries. It should really come with an adapter since it is so difficult to find the correct one."
2,Great but where do you get an adaptor?,"Great for our 5 yr old who's learning to play, but seriously, where do you get an apaptor for it? I have a bag of like 20 different adaptors from old stuff and none of those work; when you look online, none of the adaptors say they work with CTK-700 so I don't want to buy it and have that also not work. We just keep buying batteries. It's a total waste of money. So unless you own a battery store, I wouldn't buy this one but instead go find another that comes with an adaptor."
3,Proud of Bim,"I love the flag because it's my homeland but the material was not what I expected. All in all, a good buy."
3,Fluff...,"An interesting look at the lifestyle and thoughts of a Chinese American woman in San Francisco, but not very deep or meaningful. A family mystery subplot is never fully realized, which makes one wonder why it was included in the first place. Also, the author seems rather fixated on interracial relationships, but Dustin is too one-dimensional a character to explore this properly. Michael doesn't supply any dramatic tension either, as he's pretty far away from the action. This book would really rate 3.5 stars instead of 3 if it weren't for Keltner's truly annoying habit of describing sex in horrible metaphors. Repeatedly. I mean, ""the bone dance""?"
3,"Not bad, but not great","First of all, I really enjoyed Keltner's first novel, ""The Dim Sum of All Things."" I thought it was amusing, clever, entertaining, and completely right-on in some of her observations of people and customs. With that said, I felt that ""Buddha Baby"" lacked the same freshness and energy that made her first novel so entertaining. I mean, it wasn't BAD but it wasn't great, either. I felt that some of the romantic scenes with Michael, although sweet, lagged. And the story line explaining why Yun Yun was so mean? It just seemed a stretch. But I did like her characterization of Dustin. He seemed delightfully unpredictable and untameable....I actually give the novel 3.5 stars."
2,Not authentic,"Whole book rings false. Like dining at the Olive Garden and hearing cheesy Dean Martin songs played out of the speakers. Or going to lunch at a Japanese restaurant where the diners are tourists and the only Japanese people there are the ones that come just to see where the tourists eat. Dialogue seems one sided like she's talking with herself even though it's supposed to be with other people. Plot seems, for lack of a better word, pretty whack."
2,Poor Follow Up,"I was so excited to see a sequel to Keltner's earlier Dim Sum of All Things that I couldn't wait to get this one and read it. What a disappointment! The writing is often stilted as she gropes for metaphors...""...as he continues to bump his cucumber against her fruit basket.."" Keltner can do better than this!I was also saddened and a little angry with her multiple jabs at Catholic schools, Sisters, and Priests. The tirades about St. Maudes got very old!All in all, not her best effort!"
3,Nice Product!,"We received this product recently, and we love using it. It did take us quite a while to put it together, as it had many small parts. It is not professional Gym Equiptment quality, but for the price, it does get the job done!! My wife and I both use it frequently. You can also use it in reverse mode, which is great! A good buy for home equiptment, and a good motivator to keep you healthy & fit!"
2,"""Look at the size of that bed!""","""The King's Demons"" looks and sounds very medieval. Although, it does seem very inconsequential, and the conclusion is a little awkward. Ainley and Davison's swordfight looks like they're rehersing. And if the production team were trying to make Kamelion the new K-9, well, I'm glad he was just in two stories. This might be the only 2 parter that should have been a four parter(padding is needed). A tolerable pseudo-historical."
4,"""A cosmos without the Doctor scarcely bears thinking...""","A fine anniversary tale with all the right elements! The story itself is a little thin, but the story is not what we're here for. Even without Tom Baker, and Richard Hurndall portraying a tolerable 1st Doctor, the returning cast of regulars makes it still very special. Best of all is the Raston robot, Gallifrey's perfect killing machine, and the Cyberslaughter. It's a shame that Borusa had to go rogue. Lots of humor, action and some sillieness add up to great fun, and the best anniversary story in the series."
3,"for fanatics only. And no Tom Baker, either.","As a fan who gets off on seeing Daleks, Cybermen, Yeti, the Master, the Brigadier, etc. all in one place, I enjoy ""The Five Doctors."" But when I think critically about it, I have to admit that it's just not that good, although it certainly has good ideas. And the additional scenes and FX don't paper over the obvious plot cracks (i.e. where Troughton could possibly be in his own time line). Richard Hurndall nearly steals the show as Doctor #1, however. ""The King's Demons"" has an interesting premise -- involving the Master, a shapeshifting robot, and the Magna Carta -- that unfortunately goes nowhere. I'd rather recommend the original ""Five Doctors,"" but of course it's no longer available. (To be fair, there are a bunch of six-parters they refrained from milking into two-tape sets.)"
3,Good Workout - Poor Execution,"Adam seems very knowledgeable, thorough, fit and straightforward. All commendable, and in tune w/my personal style and decision to purchase- however needs improvement with connecting to his public/people skills. The audio on this is poster child to ""read from a paper"" monotone Prince to the point of being laughable; I'm not sure he notices he may not have anyones attention yet. A ceiling mount TV would be a better choice for this DVD. He barely reveals the name of the next exercise and before you can reposition the ball or look at your TV, he's well into his set. Once you become familiar with the moves and his voice - you'll get a good workout - Just be prepaired. Not knowing this was his ""Norm"" - first I purchased the AB DVD but then preceeded it with this one....only to find likenesses."
4,Tandem Surfing: On The Money,"Bob Torrez has done a fine job on this production, it's a polished and concise offering with little waste. The world of Tandem Surfing is indeed quite small, however it's roots are firmly planted in the Waterman tradition. The inclusion of Steve & Barrie Boehne is perfect. They bring a unique aura to the world of Tandem. It would not be an understatement to say they have had the most significant input to Tandem Surfing over the last 40 years. (I would suggest their DVD released a few years back as the ideal 'learners DVD'). If you are keen to understand the 'inclusiveness' of Tandem I cannot think of a better offering in which to experience it on the LCD screen.Cheers, Simon & Nicole (Freshwater Beach, NSW, Australia)."
4,Vol 7 Bunny Girl,She is pretty but her counterpart blue and white S.D Comic Con exclusive is much prettier in my opinion. Affordable and displays nicely.
3,Curtis Speaks The Truth,"Namely, that the Colts were merely unlucky in their Super Bowl III loss to the New York Jets. ""We were twice as good as the Jets,"" he states... and that's the reality of that game. The bulk of the book documents the Colts' 1971 season, and will be interesting to Baltimore Colt fans. Although it's pretty much the same as any other athlete's memoir, Curtis is quite outspoken, and has no problem showing contempt where he believes it is surely due."
1,Think and Grow Rich,"The content of the book is great. However, this version has cheap quality paper, pages that are stuck together and TONS of misspellings. I got so upset with the number of typos that I went to the bookstore and bought another copy."
1,Incorrect reviews,"I notice something peculiar. Virtually every one of the reviews on this site pertain not to this edition of ""Think and Grow Rich,"" but, instead, to the ""Action Pack"" edition, an entirely different book. This is very confusing and could be very misleading."
5,Amazing Book,"This is one of the best books ever. I love the concepts and they apply not only to money, but anything you want to have abundantly present in your life."
3,Motivating....to a point,"This book is highly motivational. I can see its influence in other business books I have read. Good to have in your library.I only gave it three stars due to personal religious values/beliefs. I agree with almost all he says. I just dont care much for his religious views. The book was progressing very well until I hit the whole ""there is no life after death"" and ""death is just eternal sleep."" The author provides this to help the reader lose his fear of death, claiming that religion (at least in the past) fostered fear of death due to the ""hell concept.""If you deal better with overlooking things like these then it is a great five star book. Otherwise, glean all the great advise given and work through this last bit- it is still worth owning and reading."
4,good read but missing a little something,"I've read all this series so far and simply fell in love with them. This was a book I couldn't put down till I finished. While I enjoyed the characters wholeheartedly I was a bit disappointed with the ending. It was rushed and left some things unresolved to my thinking. I wished there had been some dialogue with our heroine and Dalton (The Imposter). If nothing else he owed her some big apolgies! Also, I would have like to have seen Collis given an honorary title and land. If no other reason (since I can't give away the ending) then for saving the Regent or many British soldiers lives. Maybe Collis and Rose will get an honorable mention in the next LIAR'S series???"
3,Better than expected; not the best of series,"Really 3 and 1/2 stars is more accurate; I can't rate it 4, because it's not as good as The Imposter. I was hesitant to read this one because I couldn't see the maid as an appropriate heroine. She is, in fact, a very strong character...perhaps too strong for Collis, as it turns out. The angst is minimal; it should be greater considering the class differences and Collis' disability.The plot is interesting, but there are no surprises and few real thrills. Much of the humor comes from the Prince Regent, who has a big role. The book almost feels as though Bradley needed a third book, and Collis and Rose were the only leads she could come up with, so she tried to make it work--to questionable success.I enjoyed the book; it's just nowhere near the quality of the first two. The historical accuracy isn't there either, and it often sounds too modern. Ethan Damont is a very interesting character and could make a nice hero; he's perfectly set for redemption."
2,Definitely Not the Best,"I love, love, love alpha heroes. The more tortured, moody alpha the better, bring it on Anne Stuart. This book had an alpha . . . heroine. She makes all the decisions, heads up the investigations, wins all the combat, and rescues the hero. The hero waits to be rescued and makes dumb decisions and stupid mistakes. Not to mention the heroine ""throws"" the hero on the ground at least, at least three times. I did not like it hardly at all and was not amused. I like a girl with a strong character as well as anyone, but when that strength overshadows everyone else what does she need the hero for? Plus, she keeps a secret from the hero that if he were to ever find out that she knew would definitely lead to some major conflict. Absolutely read the rest of the series but skip this one."
2,give it a miss,"I tried and tried to read this book. But, I was half way through it and still trying to convince myself to keep going. Don't bother"
2,Brooch In The Field,"Sidi bou said is an london based rock or alt.rock 90's band and they released their debut album brooch in 1993, which in turn didn't sell so well and for good reasons too. I wouldn't really hold it against sidi bou for it's terrible delivery after all this was the period at when they were learning about themselves as artist's, finding their sound and growing into it. The album itself start's of with a very mediocre track ""urge"" which really isn't promising at all the mixing of the track is all over the place, the instrumentals is loud and tend's to overshadow the lead vocals in pretty much the whole album from start to finish and to make it somewhat worse there are rarely any tracks that standout at all. I would advise for all intent and purpose buy to purchase their second album first if you are curious about the band and haven't yet heard any music from them. The album brooch can bring a little pleasure to the ears but tends too lack a lot of enthusiasm overall."
2,Intriguing but unsatisfying,"At times reminiscent of the Throwing Muses' more jagged moments, with hints of prog, Pixies, and a milder Babes in Toyland. The album features sparse, raw production, with disconcerting tempo shifts and loud/soft dynamics. The songs are genuinely creative, and the lyrics - where decipherable - are intriguing, but overall the album suffers from weak vocals, unfocused songwriting and a lack of melodies. The band improved with later albums.May be of interest to fans of Tsunami, Helium or early 90s math-rock (Slint, Rodan)."
2,Didn't work well,"Too visible to be worn anywhere except at home, too weak to hold for a long period of time. I gave all mine to a friend who seems to like them."
2,All the makings of a great thriller.....but,"As I began the book I felt confident that I was in for a treat. In fact the first half had all the makings of a great thriller. Some where along the way the author got lost in the words. He developed needless characters, absurd scenarios and seemed to be more intent on filling pages with words then in telling a good tale. The climactic ending was completely unbelievable. By the end I was forcing myself to turn pages so I could move on to a new book."
2,MUCH too long and complicated,"Not sure why this book had so many raves. Because it was written before the Internet, it now reads terribly out of date, slow and clunky.Too many characters, too much dialogue and too many backstories -- and too many killers! -- cause you to begin skimming pages to get to where the action is. Because it is not a ""plot driven"" story, it's easy to skim and not really miss anything.The climax(s) work well but 200 pages could have easily been cut to make more of a ""thriller."" It's more of a ""time killer"" so save your time and money for a better plotted book."
1,Cheap,This wasn't a good buy. The item does not work and it's very cheap. I would not recomment you get one. Find a cheaper one at Ross and if it's broke then you can take it back there and replace it.
4,"Keyes is funny and wonderful, but this was too short.","This was more of a long short story than even an novella. I liked it though. The main character, Lizzie, is killed in a biking accident, but doesn't know she's dead yet. Eventually she does figure it out (with the help of these angelic social workers of sorts) & is able to leave behind some messages about life to her loved ones. The characters would have been great in a regular-sized Keyes work, but in this short format they weren't given enough fleshing-out. But all in all, Keyes is always worth a read. She consistantly writes some of the most solidly entertaining women's lit out there."
3,Pretty disappointing,"I love Marian Keyes. I bought this book because she wrote it and, yes, it was clear that this is really more of a long short story than a novel. So I was forewarned. What disappointed me was how sloppy it was. The Kindle version was a mess! It was full of typos such as words running together likethis. Suddenly in the middle of a page would be MARIAN KEYES stuck in there for no discernable reason. Whoever put this on Kindle didn't seem to care much for the experience of the reader. The story itself is, as I said, a nice little short story, but way below the usual quality of Marian Keyes' work."
1,Great start but yikes...,"I've always enjoyed Marian Keyes' books...very entertaining yet insightful. And this book started out well, too. Light and airy yet touching on something deeper, naturally.But I agree with others--it was a little too short. And more importantly, contradictory. There are angels but no afterlife? Where are those angels coming from? I found the ending grim and empty. It was like Keyes was trying to put meaning into a meaningless end, but she didn't succeed."
2,not typical Keyes...,"Bottom line--this is a 79-page short story (and those small pages have large type and large margins). I read it in less than 20 minutes, and though it was a decent story, it belongs with the small gift-like, inspirational books you find near the registers at B&N and Borders, not here as a $12 book. I own all of Keyes' books and have read (and reread and reread) them. She is an amazing author. I recommend her to everyone, but was so disappointed in this. No Dress Rehearsal should be part of a collection with either her works or with other authors. Go find it at a book store and read it in the aisle--it won't take you long."
3,Not what I was expecting,Eh...not my favorite but an easy read. I finished in probably under an hour. I would rather spend money on a book that lasts me at least a day!
3,"Good Read, too expensive.","I love Marian Keyes and this story was entertaining. I have to say though, had I noticed it was only 79 pages long I would not have bought it as the price was way too expensive for something of that length."
2,Book review,"An excellent book but too short by far.Much too difficult to download in Europe, and far too expensive compared to a full length book.G.H. Grant"
3,Check how many pages before you purchase!,This was only my second kindle purchase and thought I was getting a whole regular sized paper back. I shall check in the future as this was a great read but not worth the money for the speed with which I finished it.
4,Good Brief Work,"Silva's commentary on Philippians is an updated version of an earlier out of print work and is quite good if you are looking for a commentary that is not too technical and gets to the point of the passage. At 248 pages it is not nearly as comprehensive or in depth as Fee's commentary (497pp.) or O'Brien's (597pp.) which are the 2 best on this letter. However, Silva is equally adept at dealing with the important interpretive issues in much more succinct fashion. Worth the effort."
2,There are Better Commentaries on Philippians Available,"Was disappointed with scholarship when compared to other commentaries on Philippians. Save your money and buy either Lenski, O'Brien, Fee, or Thurston."
5,"Excellent read, definitely recommend.","I was quite pleased with this book, as it arrived in flawless condition. No scuffs or blemishes on the cover, no staining on the pages, and none were torn. Both covers intact, and no stickers/stamps/watermarks anywhere in or on the book."
2,Have to agree with the other reviewer,"This book is not that great, but it will hold your attention. Pretty much the same stuff these characters have been doing the whole time, without much growth in their personality. Extreme predictability, including the obvious ending, really hurt the book as well. Time to retire the series."
5,Great continuation of the Drizzt story,"After reading icewind Dale, I immediately went to amazon.com and ordered Legacy of the Drow. I loved this book. Not only is Artemis Entreri back, but Jarlaxle is introduced. I tend to favor bad guys in any story, usually the complicated ones who are not quite all evil. Entreri is pretty much evil, but I just love the conflict between him and Drizzt and how so similar he is to Drizzt yet so different. Jarlaxle is a type of character I love. He seems evil at first, but its a bit more complicated. Don't want to spoil anything, but he has become my favorite character in this series. You see how Salvatore has improved himself. great books"
2,Legacy of The Weak Drow!!!,"I am a fan of Salvatore, but Legacy of the Drow Collector's edition is not all that good to me. I was disappointed in how week he made the Drow in books one and two, so I decided not to read the next two. How in the nine hell's was Cattie able to survive in Menzobarranazan, she's good, but she is no Drow. The Drow are described as the fiercest and most evil creatures known in the Realms, but were defeated by Drizzt, Entrerie, and Cattie. Salvatore focuses too much on Drizzt and his accomplishments which begins to get boring after so long. If the Drow are as tough as Salvatore say's that they are, why do they always lose, and lose they always do."
1,Someone Give Dino This Book So's He Can Bury It!,"Full of glaring misinformation, hackneyed stories Bill & Joe have told a thousand times over, and recycled publicity materials, this book's only saving grace is the rare artwork they've unearthed. There's a good reason why this book features a great big 'F' on its cover!"
5,Great Collection of Vintage Aviation Stories,"I love this book. The author is a man who spent his youth accompanying his father who flew around the country for TWA in the 50's and 60's. There were lots of ""cowboys"" and ""hotdogs"" flying then. As he grew older he visited with many of these older, retired, pilots recording and collecting their stories. Nowadays it is amazing to think that many of these commercial airline pilots were actually able to pull off their stunts. Today these same things would never be permitted. Anyone who enjoys aviation will love this book."
4,With a Caveat,"Excellently written, but one really has to have an interest in the formative years of airline flying tofind this work as captivating as I did."
4,good,its what you would expect and i have knocked it off the counter a few times and it still works great so there ya go. durable the wood looks real too.
4,Classic metronome,A nice alternative to wood for the price. Works the way I remember them. I have an electronic one but the red light reminded me of the cyborgs and like the visual cue of the pendulum.
4,Metromome,You can hear this metronome clearly over the loudest note on the piano. It is easy to use. Solid exterior which looks beautiful on the piano.
4,My Metronome,"I purchased this because my piano teacher required it.It does the job, even when I get frustrated using it!"
1,Total crap,"I took it out of the box, wound it up and set it on my desk. It failed to keep a steady rhythm at any speed. It almost sounded like it was intentionally syncopating the beat. Maybe it's a jazz metronome? Returning it"
5,A great read,"One of my favorite Carolyn Haines books. Judas burning is a gripping tale set in the backwoods of south Mississippi with an array of eccentric characters, realistic geographic descriptions and plenty of twists."
5,"Good Story, Good Storyteller","I enjoyed this book as it was a good story. The prose was lean and to the point, the dialog appropriate, and the characters were believable."
2,Wear ear plugs but not shorts !,"My Homelite Blower finally quit after 10 years of terrific service. For some reason I decided to try a different brand. Maybe I didn't think 10 years was long enough.The troy-bilt blows good but no better than my old Homelite.And to blow that good it uses a lot more gas.It is extremely loud! It probably should be outlawed. I have a 10,000 Watt generator that isn't as loud.Instead of a variable speed trigger that you can operate with your finger while you hold it, it has a lever that clicks to about 4 speeds that you have to operate with your non-holding hand.Plus the exhaust exits out the back making it easy to burn yourself unless you hold it out and away. And that is awkward because it is big and heavy.It does start easy, but so did my old homelite before it died.It is unfriendly to the enviroment and user!"
2,Poor Manufacturing Quality,"I have had 2 of these in 2 years. Very noisy. First unit was replaced after a few weeks with faulty pull-start. Flimsy zipper on leaf bag broke soon after. Also had a faulty throttle lever which I lived with for about 18 months till the the cylinder head worked loose and destroyed the piston and rings. Repairs will cost more than a new unit, which is academic as I have no intention of buying anything ""Toy-Bilt"" again."
1,Horrible Blower,"I have had this blower now for about a year and a half. It started leaking gas from the carb after a couple of months (maybe 8 hours of use). And good luck getting it serviced if you bought it online. They won't honor your warranty.Now that I have used it for a season and a half (maybe 20 hours of use), it refuses to start without at least 10 minutes of trying. The throttle turns itself down constantly, and it is placed in a very poor position.It is also the loudest blower I have ever heard. I will be throwing it away and buying something else before spring.The two blowers I have owned in the past, both lasted well over 10 years, they were both Craftsman, but now all Craftman sells is a rebadged version of this piece of junk."
2,poor mulcher,"I bought this specifically because I wanted to have a better way to mulch my leaves than my mulching mower. 10:1 sounded great. After an hour of use, I have to say the ratio is close to 10:9. It is going back tomorrow. My mulching mower does much better!"
3,Arrived Broken,"Opened the box to find a broken blower( looked like someone sat on it), so called troy bilt,they sent me the parts,big deal,never offered my money back..look else where....."
1,Look Elsewhere,"I've owned this blower since 2006, first year was fine. Now, if you can get it started, it works. If you will run it every 3-4 days, it'll start. But my routine is every other week, and it does not want to start. I think the problem is the plug is on the bottom, so it gets fouled with oil. Like other comments, idle will not stay on fast it always goes to idle. It's for sale, $5 plus shipping!"
1,A piece of garbage,I had this blower for 3 years. The first year it worked ok except the throttle control kept slipping into low. The second year it took about ten minutes to start every time I used it and I had to hold the throttle control with my thumb when I used it. The third year it started once after 20 min. of priming and pulling starting cord. There is a definite problem with the carb getting gas. I used this blower about 20 hours total. It cost $145.00 when I bought it. So I figure it cost $7.25 an hour until it would not start anymore. I will never buy a Troy-Built product again.
3,Troy-Bilt Blower-vac,"The unit works well, but the bag has a light weight zipper that isn't up to the standards of the unit.I've had three (3) fail on me in a little over 1 year with modest use."
1,Troy Bilt is Junk,"What ever reputation Troy Bilt once may have had is gone....this stuff is junk...worse than low end products you can buy at your local grocery store. Plus they will not back their product...if the engine blows they refer you to the engine manufacturer...who refers you back to Troy Bilt..etc. Yeah, now one is responsible anymore, just give us your money and so long sucker!!!!"
2,not good,"starts hard,takes awhile to get up to speed,speed lever gets in the way,once it's going it's fine"
2,tired of searching,"This is my fourth blower, yet this is my first troy-bilt. It blows wellenough for our needs. I will agree with the placement and size of the low-high control.. I don't have large hands, yet i tend to knock the speed down quite often. It is very loud, even with earplugs or noise cancelling earphones. I have had this less than a year, and it leaks gas from the carb. It is a bit heavy compared to other blowers its size and strength.I don't use it for vac/mulching, thats what the lawnmower is for. ;)"
1,JunK,"Worked great the first year then died, changed the gas in it a billion times, My brother has the same model and did the same thing, died after the first year."
1,JUNK,"This blower lasted a little over 2 tanks of gas, got hot and quit - forever!! This was from the same can of gas that I use for my Homelite blower so is 32:1 rather then the 40:1 so has plenty of extra lubrication(25%). The easy start rope pull spring is shot and will only partially retract unless you let it snap back from full extension.While it worked, it did move lots of air - so that is a plus - but it still needs to run to move that air!!!"
1,Do NOT buy this blower,"Right after I purchased this product in the fall, it ran ok first couple of times. However, I used it once this spring , took awhile to start and then took several minutes of running to get up to full power. Since then the blower will not restart (even followed troy-bilt's convoluted instructions on side of blower), took it to local Troy-bilt Service, who claims I didn't have the mix right so will not be covered on warranty. I used a 40:1 mix and the same fuel worked fine in my Ryobi 2-cycle engines with no problems.Bottom line: Blower is too bulky, throttle lever gets in the way, engine is poor quality, waste of money."
1,Buyer Beware,"I purchased my first TB320BV a couple years ago. After 9 months the motor basically burned up with black yuk coming out of the cylinder head. I didn't mis-treat it but I did expect the unit to be able to run 2-3 hours at a time during the Fall season. Anyway, I threw it away and purchased another one, yes, you read right. After less than a year this one burned up as well. The authorized repair shop said ""not another one"" and not to get my hopes up for a timely repair, he had 3 others in front of mine. I called ""Troy Bilt customer service"" who gave me the usual ""what did I do wrong? Did I follow the manual?"" etc. I asked them to call the authorized repair and help me get it repaired. They basically said ""not my job mon."" So it's still at the repair shop for over a year. If you want a 20 minute blower/vac this may work for you, as for me, Never Ever Again will MTD get my money."
1,Piece of Junk,"This is my second blower. It starts good for the first couple of times that you use it and after that it seems to stall and is difficult to start. I have not been impressed with Troybilts products; it seems that quality control is not something that they pride themselves in. Take a look at the Troybilt's home page, even the ratings on their own page tell the truth, save your money, buy a Stihl!"
1,This is junk,"When I purchased this from Lowes I thought Troybilt was a good brand. Unfortunately for me, this blower is cheap junk. After about 10 uses, the engine seized. I have not been able to get it started. When I complained, I was told it was operator error that caused this to seize. BULLCRAP. The machine is junk. Do not buy it, you will regret it. I did. I will never buy a Troybilt machine, especially after reading all the bad reviews. Too bad, I liked Lowes."
1,Built to Fail,"This blower has a plastic engine mount that is held on by 4 self tapping screws that are screwed into plastic. The screws back out and contact the impeller and eat through the platic wheel causing the catastrophic failure of the impeller. The two parts involved are about $30.00 but Troy Bilt would not send replacements because I did not have my original receipt. Even though the serial number proved it was manufactured in 2009 they would not stand behind this obvious defect in manufacturing when all I asked was for the replacement parts and nothing more. Don't waste your money on this product, it is designed for failure! I will never buy another Troy bilt product."
2,Does not whistle,I purchased this item recently and from the first time I used it the whistle does not work. I would love to return it but did not receive a return item slip with my order. I would not purchase this type of item (one that may have a problem and needs to be returned) again from Amazon.
3,"Ok, but not premium","The belts worked as expected but after buying a different brand, I noticed this brand ""junked"" up quickly and the belt was more fragile, breaking often.I recommend mercer abrasive premium belts instead. 100% different performance in those."
5,experimental novel; many stories expertly blended,"Vellum is not for everyone. Neither isHouse of Leaves,The Illuminatus! Trilogy: The Eye in the Pyramid, The Golden Apple, Leviathan,City of Saints and Madmen, or (dare I link to my own book?)Chunnel Surfer II.It seems to be one of a new trend in novels, an ""experimental novel"" if you will that takes multiple related stories, shreds them and re-weaves them in new and interesting ways, the result greater than the sum of its parts, due, in part, to the tendency of the reader's mind to fill in the gaps and create connections when they are not explicitly in the text."
1,Awful fiction,"An unruly mess of bad ideas mashed together and wrapped in angst-ridden narration and meaningless dialogue. Duncan sat down and said, ""I'm going to take every idea I have about the world and scribble it on little pieces of paper, lay them in order while blindfold, mix them up for good measure, and see if I can get someone to publish it because it's original and includes such an impossible number of loosely-connected ideas, I think it'll apply to everyone.""PUKE"
3,Frustrating,"All of my beefs with this book are largely matters of personal preference. I don't do well with extremely disjointed and abstract writing; I find it hard to connect the dots and make the leaps in logic required. Vellum is nothing BUT leaps in logic and abstractions, which makes it hard to follow. There's some gorgeous writing, and I find the premise fascinating, but I need something significantly more concrete. I got through the first 2/3 of the book pretty quickly, but the last third frustrated me so badly I had to keep putting it down. I didn't understand what was happening, or how it all connected, or even what I was supposed to be getting from the book. Sadly, I don't think I'll be reading the sequel, Ink. It's just too frustrating."
1,Not worth the time to read.,"Honestly I saw this book on the shelf and jumped at it, i read the inside cover and it just sounded like it would be an amazing book. I even read the first page in the store and it caught my interest. But I am sadly disappointed, this book quickly devolved into a mess I couldn't even figure out. I gave up trying to read it as well it just jumped around and made to little sense.It sounded great in concept, but the execution was just terrible."
2,Not for me,"I was utterly captivated by the first 25 pages of this book. Then something went horribly wrong, and I became quickly dissapointed. The premise is brilliant, but the characters didn't interest me in the slightest and the constant change of point of view was jarring. The writing itself was pretty good, but there was a frequent shifting between present to past tense which I found very difficult to adjust to. I just couldn't keep up with what was going on, and I didn't feel I knew enough about the characters to care much about them."
3,A bit too much,"Lots of great ideas and great bits all jumbled up into a mess. I'd call it more pretentious than ambitious. I wish he had cut a few characters, spent more time with the best bits, and realized that even a non-linear plot needs a sense of resolution. Still, worth the afternoon I spent reading it, and I'm curious to loan this to some Pynchon fans I know to get their perspective. I'll keep an eye out for this guy's future books because if he ever gets over himself he could be good."
3,Painful Potential,"The next time an editor gets a first draft from hal duncan, he should read it, then roll it up into a tube and beat duncan with it until he writes something more succinct. the man has talent, but vellum is an extremely disjointed book that could've done with a few more rounds with the delete key. non-linear storylines are the thing to do nowadays, but oy, this aint the illuminati here!"
3,takes a bit of getting used to,"If Snow Crash had been written in the style of the illuminatus trilogy and done by Neil Gaiman, you might have someting close to Vellum, while i confess i have not yet finished it, i think the only way i am progressing at the rate i am is that i've read Shea and Wilson's Illuminatus. After their own time jumps and perspecive changes, Duncan's are a breeze. At least Duncan waits for new paragraph to change form first person to third."
3,Alternately compelling and meandering,"Hal Duncan's first novel is obviously just that - a first novel. Vellum contains several books worth of nifty ideas, none of which are really developed in a satisfying way. Duncan is in general so focused on pushing sytlistic boundaries with the contruction of the book that he looses track of much of its potential. In particular, Vellum could have benefitted from a sharp editorial pencil in cutting out some of the repetitous material (the gay oppression political angle is fine, and valid, but is harped on so vigourously in the first half of the book that its impact is greatly diluted; also, the scenes of WWI imagery are tediously similar and overplentiful).That said, I did enjoy the book, and am thinking hard about buying the sequel to read the next time I have a 7-hour plane flight to sit through...."
3,Velluminously Confusing,"It seemed this book would never end. I kept waiting for something to tie the various elements together. I'm still waiting. Some major characters disappear for ages while others pop in and out for no apparent reason. I have no idea what Duncan was trying to say, but he sure took a lot of time trying. Maybe that's the best one word description of this book - trying.All that said, the writing style showed possibilities. Had the story been easier to track, I think Duncan's style would have been enjoyable. I will try Ink. Maybe things will coalesce when taken as a whole.I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes straightforward story telling and an easy to follow plot."
1,Too Much Vellum,"Now and again, I enjoy reading works that will stimulate my brain and open my eyes to something new and different without the flowery phrases or the plot that goes over everyone's head without any form. Vellum falls into the latter category: Duncan tries too hard to get his message across and instead makes it more of a rats' nest of ideas and concepts rather than an insightful and page turning novel. I really wanted to give this book a chance because I had heard so much about it but I could barely get beyond page 48. There is no question that Duncan has quite the imagination but the writing style and coherency of the novel leaves little to be desired."
1,Don't waste your time!,"The cover of this book caught my eye and it sounded interesting, about the end of days and angels and demons. Duncan writes in such a way that it is work to figure out which characters he is talking about at any given moment. He changes scenes within a paragraph. I got to page 100 and decided that I should be into the book by now and gave up. Aside from being all over the place, it takes place in different times and realities. It is also written with a British accent (I think), Irish accent, ancient language, but mostly swearwords. I am not opposed to sex and violence in books but I thought it was unneccesary. I was really disappointed that I bought this book."
1,A fine line,"Hal Duncan is living proof that there is a very fine line between genius and insanity. Unfortunately, this book proves good ol' Hal is more the latter than the former. This book reads like it was written by a complete maniac. Granted you can't help but be impressed by the genius of it all, but that doesn't make it a good, or even readable, story.I finished the book only because I forced myself to do so. This book is so easy to put down. There are many parts, when one of the oh-so-frequent changes between different characters (or perhaps the same character with a different name, or in a different time) would come along, where I'd find myself thinking ""oh, I just can't do this right now."" I'd then put the book down, and go back to actually doing work at my job because that was more appealing than forcing my way through more of this mindless drivel."
1,Forcing Myself to Finish,"I'm about 375 pages into this book and have to confess that my compulsive tendency is the only thing driving me to finish it. I hate not finishing a book and only the dregs get thrown into the recycling pile before I've read the last word. This one is almost there. Purporting to be about the big idea of the battle for the Vellum between the angels etc, I find that it is mostly about nothing much and nothing much actually happens. Streams of boring prose are spewed forth page after page while nothing of substance advances the ""BIG"" idea. Characters ramble on forever. Advancement of the story is almost nil.If you like this sort of purposeless meandering, you probably would like Gravity's Rainbow by Pynchon, only Pynchon is a vastly better writer."
3,Asks a lot of the Reader,"I really want to enjoy this book, but it demands a -lot- of the reader. Reading this novel feels more like work than leisure. The story is told in such a fragmented way that it's nearly impossible to keep tabs on what is going on, but the ideas and characters are interesting enough that I was kept hoping that everything would cohere -eventually-.This could be a great read if it were written just a bit more traditionally."
2,A sophomoric attempt to produce great literature.,"It starts off as if it will be a gripping story and then it compltely drops the ball. Frank Herbert's ""Dune"" series was able to tie in philosophical concepts with an engaging plot and captivating characters. Hal Duncan's novel loses all intrigue quickly, leaving the majority of the story stale.Don't get me wrong: I actually enjoyed a lot of Duncan's concepts and imagery, hence I gave him 2 stars instead of just 1. Yet it takes more than just interesting ideas and gratuitous prose to create a novel. I am a fan of cyber-punk, hard science fiction, as well as dark fantasies, but Vellum misses the mark.Bottom line: Hal Duncan is trying too hard."
1,Not recommended,"Vellum was the most tedious book I have ever finished. Having read some very positive reviews, I continued on, constant in the hope it would amaze me. That never happened and I'm truly sorry I didn't put it aside after a hundred pages. Frankly, one would have to be much more pretentious than I am to enjoy this book. It's non-linear, buckshot writing that demands far too much of the reader without a valid return. If you want something overblown to bolster your literary ego, maybe this is for you. Those seeking an entertaining, thought-provoking story should look elsewhere."
4,messy at times,"The bratz makeover torso is really cool if you want to pretend you are a stylist but the torso can be REALLY,REALLY messy with the glitter so if you don't play with this in the bathroom , play on the floor with a garbage bag under you."
2,completely without a spark,"I'm obviously in the minority here but I found this book virtually impossible to wade through. The prologue was a classic example of obfuscation at its finest. I was at almost the last page (skimming I admit) before I had even a glimmer of what she was trying to set up at the beginning and once I understood I remained completely clueless as to why she chose to start the book with that scene. So from my perspective, the book started off badly, ended on a down note and contained nothing engaging, enlivening or even particularly interesting between the beginning and the end. A fact which I found particularly disappointing because it's clear that McGarry can write (which is something I can't say anymore about certain other well known fantasy authors). My advice is to read a few pages of the book and see how they strike you before you buy - if it doesn't click right away - based on my experience it won't get any better."
4,Illumination,"I had thought that the Fantasy genre had about petered out. Then along comes Terry with Eiden Myr and I suddely have found a new world to play in. Despite the names I can't pronounce, reading this book made me feel like I did when I used to act out my childhood fantasies. In an age when science fiction gets all the attention, this is a serious fantasy that will bring you in and keep you entranced until it's way too late to be up!"
2,Spacy and overly artsy,"This book has a lot of good ideas behind it, but it's not very well written. Sure, the prose is clean and nice, but there's no passion behind it, no spark of genius or excitement, like comes through in Goodkind or Martin, or Jordan and Haydon, both of whom plugged it but whose work far surpasses it. Liath is a fairly interesting character but she degenerates into a predictable female role, when she could have been so much more. I recommend a read of this when you have a long weekend with nothing to do--it's hard to get through, but it does have some interesting passages. You might want to wait for the paperback, however."
4,beautiful,"natalia's music is not only well written and performed, it is food for the soul. anyone who likes folk, artists and music that makes them feel should definitly check it out."
2,It ain't too bad,I've got this CD and it's not too bad but if you're not a Powell Fan...don't buy it!
2,too much emphasis on white,I was disappointed by the lack of variety...I feel that she overstressed her personal preference for white.
3,Just OK,"Maybe I didn't read the description well enough, but I expected a book with some photos and examples, which this didn't have. It was OK."
5,enjoy soft tea time,we ues these cup for morning tea time. these are beautiful and good for all purpose.
5,"good, relevant, refreshing, real","Thank you Renee. This book deals with everyday people, not some fantasy character all neat and proper and ""spiritual"". I'm learning more and more how important it is to live life authentically and that to do so is to stop pulling an Adam and Eve. Living authentically really allows one to open and truthul not just with themselves, but with God and others. It allows God to move in and through us so we are not controlling circumstances but trusting that God is in control. Its a healthy lifefstyle; one that I believe Jesus embraced. He's my hero. I wish more christian authors wrote about flawed people instead of just flawed cirsumstances.Best!"
1,Doesn't work,"I got this and no matter what temperature the water is, the word ""HOT"" shows up and doesn't go away."
5,Great little ducky!,"We got the fireman! This rubber ducky is perfect for the bath. There is no way for water to become trapped inside, causing mold. Going to order another one....wonder which one I'll get?"
2,good as bath toy,"I bought this to help assist with bath time so that I would know if the water temp was right for baby. No matter how warm the water was the ""hot"" word always popped up. This is only good for a bath toy, there is another one available just like this that is digital and give the temp in numbers, i think that would be a better option."
3,Doesn't Work for Intended Purpose,"If you're buying this duck to tell you if the bath water is too hot for your baby, DON'T. It's definitely not an accurate tool for this purpose.However, I do like this as a bath toy, mainly because there is no hole in the bottom. Bath toys with holes allow water inside, which eventually creates mold & mildew. (gross) Not so with this toy, so it should last longer than many of our other toys.Please notice the ""colors may vary"" in the description. I ordered this duck for my son & received a mermaid duck. Oh well. He likes it, even if it is intended for a girl. It's the risk you take when ordering something like this online.If you are looking for something to help you with water temperature, I have found that theAquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Greenworks REALLY well. It's also very inexpensive."
2,Doesn't work well for us,"This is a cute idea so that your little one doesn't hurt themselves on the bath tub spout, however it doesn't work really well for us...it does fit onto our spot, but we cannot pull the lever up to turn it into a shower if the duck is on, so we would have to put it on and take it off each time we wanted to give her a bath - the problem with that for us is that it's such a tight fit that it's difficult to get off and feels like it's going to pull the spout off the wall..."
5,I could feel her pain,"Pauline Laurent wrote Grief Denied: A Vietnam Widow's Story. I'm glad I had the opportunity to actually meet Pauline before I read her story. It's hard to believe she has had so much sorrow in her life and yet she keeps an upbeat attitude. This excellent book shows Pauline's struggle to deal with the loss of her husband, the birth of her child, her pain for more than 20 years and how she coped.This book showed what this one woman went through and I'm sure so many others did too. BUT Pauline has had the courage to write about how Howard's life and death affected her and her child. It is a well-done book and should be read by everyone. I sincerely hope that it helps other widows heal also especially now that we have another generation of young widows among our population. Pauline should be proud of this book."
5,Tears Like Rivers Were Meant To Flow,"Reading Pauline Laurent's book, Grief Denied, A Vietnam Widow's Story has helped me painfully yet better understand the denied grief that is within me - grief and fear that colors my values and lends a dark skepticism to my personality in ways that my own psychiatric training has failed to enlighten. It hurts to have our darkness exposed to the light of Truth. I don't like hurt. Pauline's text has inspired me to ""flow on"", not to worry about the tears! After all, tears like rivers were meant to flow. It is the stuff of life. When we try to stop the flow...stagnation! I still want to work with patients, but in a different way, a way that is more spiritual, more meaningful for both of us."""
3,very interesting,"This would be an interesting movie to cast but nowadays, the dilemna would be solved with a visit to Dr. 90210 to acquire one's own pair of Grand Tetons."
2,ripper of all trades,"only heard one song - save me - is this he story of one mans struggle to find himself? It was catchy and cute, yet a tad frankenfido, with priest presiding over the marriage of yul brynners hair to donny osmonds teeth, so to speak.One hopes that now that he's sporting his own size nines, the rest of him might show up for honeymoon, without the priest or donny's teeth. And what do you mean this isn't the Goodies home page? oh - oops."
5,Ripper's back,"First It is great to see a man whose proud of his metal roots and wears them proudly. This cd is way different from Tim's work on iced earth's glorious burden ( The best metal record ever!). It has a more american feel than previous owens efforts which might make it more accessible to american audiences. Ripper has an amazing voice and gives this band his all. The band is tight with some great double bass drumming and nice solos. My personal favorites are: coming at you,Save me,my last words, and The faith. This is a great metal record with a guy that can really sing and in a world of metalcore and death metal I think it's awesome that this band is around. Now with that said a plea to Tim owens PLease stay in iced earth and beyond fear cause we need two great metal bands that release new material."
4,Real heavy metal need only apply here,"This is a darn good album. Bone jarring, crunchy guitar riffs with Owen's glass shattering vocals! One of the other reviewers said it right - this is a perfect blend of Priest and Iced Earth.If you like Dream Evil and classically good heavy metal (not the numetal crap) then this disc is for you!"
3,great work music,It reminds me a bit of Damageplan but with better vocals. I have always been a big fan of Ripper and his singing did not disappoint. The album is lyrically dull compared the the epic bands that I prefer. The music gets your blood pumping. This is a great album to play at work or at the gym but not one that you can sit down and listen-to. None of the guitar riffs are very clever but do sound good. I incorporated it into a couple playlists and relegated the disc to storage.
4,Metal Mania,"If You like Judas Priest,Halford and his other band Fight than You will like Beyond Fear.A full heavy metal onslaught.tracks ""Save Me"" and ""Scream Machine"" are the best."
4,The Ripper,"I think this is more Ripper Ownes! He did well fronting preist, but this is more his style."
2,Should Have Been Better,"Tim ""Ripper"" Owens always sounds good on vocals, no matter what. And if the entire Beyond Fear debut album had been like the opening cut ""Scream Machine,"" it would have gotten five stars. But this CD is a bit inconsistent, with most songs being rather average--and at least one cut, ""Coming At You,"" being quite weak. ""Ripper"" Owens has been on the vocal end of at least one CD that is superior to this one, namely Iced Earth's ""The Glorious Burden"" (which is a masterpiece!). Beyond Fear does contain some solid, aggressive power metal but overall it lacks consistency and the lyrical content is weak, too; for instance, the song ""Telling Lies"" seems to be a slam at President George W. Bush but no matter what you may think of why or how we got into the war in Iraq, Metal is not the musical genre to tackle political issues. Leave that to the Bob Dylans and U2s of the world."
1,Unhappy experience,"The Ignite Power Walker with a 44"" tread length is really too short for anything but a slow stroll. Speed up and you fly off the back. The machine's computer broke down after two weeks and the customer service representatives suggested that we did not have the expertise or tools necessary to deal with it. The machine has been returned."
1,My daughter loves the Teletubbies BUT,"This Little Teletubby is based on the This Little Piggy rhyme. Unfortunately, the rhythm is lacking, the repetition uninspired, and the conclusion blah. My two-year-old daughter, who will beg me to read the same book ten times in a row, furrowed her little eyebrows after two readings of this book and said, ""No, Mama, put it away."" That pretty much covers it. I would return it if I still had the packaging."
5,Pretty Sweet,"This thing is pretty awesome. I've been collecting wine corks for about a year now and didnt know what to do with them. After doing some research online, I ordered one of these in early Decemeber. I made one for my Mom and after seeing my sisters get jealous, I had to order two more and make one for each of them. It's great for a housewarming gift or any celebration. I'm all out of corks now but once I build my collection up again, I'll be sure to order another one to have in my own home. Another great thing is that you can remove the clear plastic covering to clean if someone happens to spill something on it. It's also pretty fun placing the corks into position, it's like a big puzzle. Just an FYI, you'll need about 100 corks (give or take a few) to complete the board. Great product..."
5,Cork Crazy,"I ordered two of these a gift for myself and for a friend. They are quality products. They come with glue & sand paper & a wall hanger in case you want it, but I am using mine as a tray. I did not glue my corks because I very carefully made them have a pretty tight fit & the plexiglass cover holds them secure. The one I made for a friend, I shipped UPS & the unglued corks did not dislodge. Keep in mind this takes a lot of corks (160+) & was pretty tedious to sort & work in some special ""one of a kinds"". It was a great snow day project to make two of these and two trivets. I love it, as does my friend & it makes a beautiful centerpiece on my baker's rack and works well for serving appetizers. It's awesome."
3,Reference Book,The photos are rather small with not a lot of descriptions. The photos are predominately black and white and there is not indication of original dolls and clothing. Kind of leave the reader to arrive at their own decisions.
2,Not for children! Terrible movie! Flash knock-off sucks!,"This was an absolutley awful knockoff of The Flash from DC Comics.Stan Lee should be ashamed that his name is plastered across the DVD box cover.The acting is poor, the villain is just annoying (not scary).This is a very bloody and brutal movie that should NOT be shown to children.How on earth could they have gotten it so wrong? Well they did.The costume even sucked. I could have found a better costume on eBay!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Buy The Flash TV series instead!"
1,Do Not waste your time!,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I cannot believe that Stan Lee would allow his name to be attached to this waste. Basically special ops team gets wiped out by Psycho snake guy (which they deserve to get for their bad representation of a Spec Ops), sole survivor is healed with a special radiation which gives him super speed. He finds out his boss and snake guy are planning to wipe out the city of DC for revenge... Blah Blah Blah typical storyline. If there was cheese in this movie it would be a step up. the Vulgarity over-dubs are an insult to the watcher and the actors both, and the only funny line in the movie is, ""Blue, its a nice color, I've always wanted to die in blue"".Just do not get it."
1,bad bad bad,"Just, awful. The only thing about the movie that is slightly entertaining is the ""running really fast"" special effect, since the actor is so out of shape he can only jog. It's entertaining for about 10 seconds to watch sped up jogging with a blue streak behind him until you realize you paid money for this crap.And, no, this is not a ""so bad it's good movie"", it's just bad."
1,Just BAD,"This movie was so bad that I am speechless. And, what was Lee Majors thinking about when he agreed to do this movie?Terrible movie... really bad."
2,BE GENTLE ...,"Well, yes guys, it's bad plus it got Stan the Man's name on it, shame. Anyway: don't ignore the fact that this is just a TV-production."
1,Poor Choice,If I could give this no Stars I would. It was obviously poorly funded. everything about this movie sucked. I really wish I could have my money back.
1,H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E!!!!!,"First off, Amazon, you need to create the use of negative stars for this DVD here because it deserves a -10!!This movie is so bad, I would rather take a vacation in Iraq in the middle of the fighting than view this travesty again!!!This has got to be one of the worst movies ever made in the history of this planet earth! It's a God-awful Flash wanna-be that should have been put out of its misery at conception!To tarnish Stan Lee's name like that is unforgivable. I truly doubt that Stan ""The Man"" Lee had anything to do with this laughable oddity! The fact that there are no extras at all let alone with him somewhere in them is proof enough for me to see he had nothing to do with it. He always usually appears in some kind of featurette, especially if it's from a comic book superhero!If you see this movie in any kind of store run as fast as you can to get away from this garbage and maybe you can attain LIGHTSPEED!!!"
3,"Could be better, could be worse.","Very ""hokey"" story of being eaten by underground monsters. Many biological and physical impossibilities happening throughout the flick. Poorly wriitten also but I like Kevin Bacon."
5,MES PLUS GRANDS SUCCES,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF FRANCK POURCEL FOR OVER 20 YEARS.IT IS A SHAME THAT THERE ARE A FEW CDS OF THIS GREAT CONDUCTOR.I HAVE MOST OF HIS ALBUMS ON RECORDS & TAPES.NO DOUBT,THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF HIS GREATEST PERFORMANCES."
4,Gripping First Hand Account,"Across the Frozen Himalaya is a gripping first-hand account of a 2,000-km winter ski traverse from the treacherous Karakoram Pass to the Lipu-Lekh Pass undertaken in the severest of mid-winter.The Karakoram Pass is the most capricious of all mountain passes. Its importance lies in that it is located on the ancient silk route connecting India and Central Asia.The Himalayan range is a mountain's paradise but certainly not an ideal ski ground. It is rather difficult to have long range cross-country skiing because of the various rivers cutting across the ranges. Hence, the decision to traverse over the crest line and to cross the frozen rivers by sledge makes it a challenging task.The entire traverse is an action packed record of mental preparation, setting a target and achieving a goal. Human emotions under adverse conditions are underscored. A vivid description combined with geological importance of the passes makes the book an informative and inspiring piece of reading."
4,A cold tickle in the throat,"It's like getting a cold, that tickle in the throat that you know is going to develop into something. Try it and I promise, you will end up curling up with the book."
4,A great adventure story,"This is an exciting story that will surprise you. An introduction to twenty mountain passes, a dozen valleys and at least four important mountain regions on which you can write a book each. Try it, you wont regret it."
4,A Story to be Read.,"A finest example of how an international team; from India, America, Australia and the UK, can break territorial and mental boundaries to become thick friends and risk their own lives for the sake of others. There are lessons to be learnt. A story to be read."
4,Great adventure - Good Reading,"This is a real good adventure for all those who love skiing and Himalayas. Worth your money with plenty of information and philosophycal thoughts that will amaze you. A mix of Deepak Chopra and Arundhati Roy. Try it, you wont regret it."
4,across the frozen himalaya,"This will surprise you. How on earth can you walk on the spine of the Himalaya? Well, may be you can but can you ski across the top in the winter? Harish Kohli and his team of seven members did just that. 'across the frozen himalaya' is not about self esteem or personal glory, it is simply about a ski adventure - the book reads like a fiction and before you realise you are part of the plot itself. You are taking an inspirational journey through the Himalayas from which the Indian sages had acquired strength and knowledge.Like the 'Seven Spiritual Laws of Success' the # 1 best seller by Deepak Chopra there are messages - told almost quietly - that we need to learn from nature. As the cold wind whips your cheek so will the history of the place come alive in front of your eyes. Stage by stage as the team moves forward, Kohli keeps you occupied with interesting episodes that will bind you to the event, keep you entertained and exhaust you with bone-chilling drama."
1,Me and Mobuto and Me and Mandela and especially ME,I was hoping to read about what has happened in Africa in the last few years. Instead I found a tome about a very self-absorbed woman. This really is a terrible book. Don't look for any insight into Mubuto Sese Seko or Nelson Mandela. I did a Google search on Lynn Duke because I couldn't--and still can't--fathom that the Washington Post would hire a person who wrote a book this bad.
2,Not so Iconic,I put these on my 05 F-150 a few months ago and about a week there after I drove 3 days from Texas to Virginia and one of those days I experienced an insane amount of rain non-stop for 12hrs. My driver side blade (420a) are ok in the lower and middle portions of the blade but streak very much at the top. The passenger side (420b) simply jusy streaks. I'm not sure what's so great about these wiper blades besides to locking mechanism but I think my OEM ones were honestly better. It sucks becuase this product got such good reviews and it's hard to believe out of all the good ones I'm the guy giving it a low rating. I will probably try the Rain-X ones next and just save these for a backup.
2,Good until they fall apart.,My wipers were starting to die so I decided to go all out and buy nice new ones for my car. Read lots of really good reviews so I decided to get these top of the line Bosch Icon wiper blades. I disregarded the poor reviews because of all the good ones out there. Bad mistake.They worked wonderfully for about a month and then the drivers side started to streak. Not too long after the passengers side started to streak. Decided not to make a big deal out of it so I got the drivers side replaced and left the streaky passengers side. Worked again for about a week and while driving in a big rain storm the drivers side is streaking very poorly again. Just got both sides replaced again.Whats bad is that these steak in really fine lines so they are really distracting.When these die out I'll just get the cheapo inserts again. Maybe I just got bad batches but I'm not going to deal with these again.
4,Is it possible to love windshield wipers?,"I've always gotten the cheap blades—living in the California valley rain isn't much of a concern. My last wipers always squeaked, one never fit quite right and they looked cheap. These blades are expensive for wipers, however they're as silent as wipers could be, they connect really great with my windshield and do a great job.Minus one star for the crazy price. They're plastic and rubber, no need for such a price tag. If these last me more than a couple years I'll give them the full 5 stars."
1,"Bosch 420A ICON Wiper Blade, 20"" (Pack of 1)","Bosch 420A ICON Wiper Blade, 20"" (Pack of 1) when new they worked. But for the cost of these blades they should last more then a few months NOT HAPPY"
5,"Bosch 420A ICON Wiper Blade, 20""","BOUGHT A PAIR OF THESE FOR MY 2001 CHEVY S-10. I HAVE USED THEM FOR ABOUT 1.6 YEARS AND THEY STILL DO AN EXCELLENT JOB. THEY DO SEEM TO MISS THE EXTREME RIGHT HAND CORNER FOR ABOUT AN INCH AT TYHE BOTTOM, BUT I STILL RATE THEM 5 STARS FOR OVERALL PERFORMANCE. THEY ARE ALSO SIMPLE TO INSTALL."
5,Excellent,"Gotta love elegant engineering, and the minute you see the way these blades are packaged, you can begin to appreciate the thought that has gone into this product.I had ordered a set of Siltech blades, but sent them right back when I saw the sack full of cheapo arm adapters of the ""one-size-kinda-fits-all "" ilk.The Bosch Icons came ready to mount. Took less than two minutes to install them both.They work perfectly, no smearing, no chatter. They are a tad pricey, but if I get year's worth of decent service out of them I'll be happy."
2,Not worth the money,"2007 Honda Odyssey in Syracuse, NY. I bought these when they were on sale and I had a rebate which ultimately made them 2-for-1 cost. At full price, I would have been resoundingly disappointed. The driver side wiper never makes complete contact with the windshield at slower speeds. From what I have read in hindsight, this is not uncommon. Would definitely buy the less expensive wiper blades and save the premium price."
4,Great for beginners,"This is a great book for beginner investors wanting to get an overview of technical analysis. Although each section doesn't go very in depth into each topic, you will still get a good understanding of how to use the different analysis tools to your advantage. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because it is a bit pricy, but still has a lot of good information that is very well presented. The end of chapter quizes and reviews were also helpful."
4,Wasmuth Portfolio for the money challenged,"Can't afford a genuine Wasmuth Portfolio? This is for you. It would have been better if it had been bound in landscape format like the pages inside, but this is very much worth the money if you have any interest in the early works of FLLW and a good look at the floor plans of the buildings of that period."
3,FLW lovers will like,"If you are into F L Wright you will like this. I could sit and read for hours, my wife only for 2 minutes."
3,Just about what I expected.,It's dated but interesting! Not much to think about but only to review pictorial-wise. Not a cocktail table book to speak of.
5,perfect timing,"Perfectly on time for Christmas, excellent condition, and perfect for the boy who wants to be an architect. well done"
1,I wish it would arrive!,I would be delighted to review this item but this is the second time I've ordered it and it still hasn't arrived!
5,Addictive funk beats,"There are over 150 examples of funk beats in this book, and 89 of them are included on the cd, played by Mike Clark. The beats in this book are so addictive that I spent three days just playing the first 3 grooves in this book, just trying to get the groove and feel right and coming up with my own variations. Each example beat uses accents and ghost notes very tastefully which makes them very interesting to play for a long time, and sort of forces you to come up with your own variations. I haven't found a drum book this enjoyable since Steve Gadd's ""up close""."
5,Thank you for sharing the tragic story of heroic struggle to live,"I just finished another very painful but interesting and shocking memoirs in ""Thanks to my Mother"" by Shoshana Rabinovici and started this book. It's absolutely shocking and heroic struggle to do everything possible to survive day-by-day and minute-by-minute the Systematic Nazi Plan to annihilate the Jewish People.Highly highly recommend to every one who is interested in Holocaust and to everybody to read and to learn what was really WWII about."
5,Amazing story!,Please read this true account of a brave young girl who lived to tell against all odds through the horrors of the holocaust.
5,A Well Written Book by a Very Brave Lady!,"It would be totally unfathomable to imagine what people do to each other in the name of war if it weren't for people like Alicia. Her story is absolutely mind-boggling! I can't even begin to imagine the depth of hatred that would subject people to this type of cruelty because of their nationality. My heart goes out to all the families who lost loved ones in this cruel and unnecessary war. Thankfully, there are people like Alicia who lived through the horror and have shared their stories with us. This, in turn, should really make us appreciate the peace and freedom we have in our own Country. A great book!"
5,One of the best!!!!,"I read this book over 10 years ago. It remains one of my favorite books, it literally changed my life. Alicia shows what true courage and love is through her experience. She always put others first in trying to help them the best she could. Alicia is a true example of what a greatness and kindness can come out of tradegy. She is a great human being that many should follow her example of. This is the kind of book you cannot put down. Buy this book and read it, you will not regret it."
4,Alicia,"I read a lot of Holocaust-related stories in middle school. As morbid as it sounds, they were so interesting, and so heartbreaking to read. There are quite a few more still sitting in my closet that I could review, but this was my favorite, and probably the one that got me into the topic. A really great story, particularly because it's a true one."
5,One of the best books ever written,Reading this book makes you get all emotional. There are many shocking things that happen and you realize how bad the Holocaust really was and the sorrow you feel for all who died. The author came to my school to talk about her experiences too. You'll feel sad yet angry at the same time. I would recommend this book to readers of all ages.
5,A page turner about a brave and couragous teenager!!!!!!!!!!,This was an awesome book that was about a teenager who lived in the holocaust and how her bravey helped her through it. This is a must on everyone's Christmas List. Hope you will enjoy this book. This book was so touching that i am doing a report on the holocaust.
5,OUTSTANDING!!!,I have read this book many times over since I was in the eighth grade and it has so deeply affected me that I have lent it to many teachers from when I was in school and it tore my heart apart when I first read it. It is a must read for anyone interested in the Holocaust.
3,okay,"I thought the book was okay but the book wasn't all that great. The first couple of chapters were good but it got real boring towards the end. The only good parts were at the end when Alicia's mother was shot and when SS men attacked the train. I thought ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" was better than this story. Both stories had their good and bad sides to it. What I thought was weird was that after Alicia's family died she didn't just turn herself in because of the pity and sadness. I also don't think it would be so easy to escape like she did."
1,Bad Book,Alicia: My Story is a good book about a girl that goes through outstanding odds to survive the WWII. I think this would be a good book for anyone who thinks the war didn't happen. This story may seem to be a fiction but it is a true story. I suggest this book to anyone who thinks the war didn't happen. This is a good book for people who want a touching book.I did not like the book.
1,BORING,"THIS BOOK WAS INTERESTING I GUESS, IF YOU LIVE IN THE '30SBUT THIS IS THE '90S SO I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY BORING.MAYBE I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT, OR MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSEI DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE TO READ IT (I HAD TO). THAT'S ALLI HAVE TO SAY, I WOULDN'T RECCOMEND IT TO ANYBODY, WELL,MAYBE MY GRANDMA, SHE WOULD LIKE IT!"
5,great cd,this is a great cd. especially the song. Fly. the song that is not on any of her other cd's. and I would know that. cause I have mosr. if not all. her cd's. that she has put out. or released. so far. I am one of her biggest. and loyal fans. as well. too. so listen to this cd. or buy it. or get. it will be well worth it. if you did. I swear. too. thanks.
1,NOT A GOOD CHOICE OF SONG,"WHILE JESSICA SIMPSON IS AN AMAZING SINGER, THIS SONG IS SUNG VERY WELL , IT JUST DOES NOT SUIT WHO SHE IS . IT SUITS ROBBIE WILLIAMS BETTER ."
3,Review of Basic Reliability,"This book is full of typographical errors spelling errors, grammatical errors, and omissions (for example, the book states: see formula for the three parameter Weibull distribution and then jumps to discussion of the formula without telling you what it is). The graphics are also poor. Fortunately, the cost is low. I would recommend any new reader have another Reliability text to which to refer when reading this one in order to determine whether equations are correct or not (for example, on page 47 the book states that R(t)= e to the lambda (t) when in fact R(t) = e to the minus lambda (t). And the word ""lambda"" is misspelled as ""lamda"".)."
2,Not good,"This book is full of errors, inconsistencies, grammatical errors, and bad math. But has few buzz words to look up. Better to read more comprehensive book."
4,Excellent technical Reference,"The book was a very informative and objective reference ,that elaborates the basic concept of reliability Engineering in a very apprehensive way."
3,Reliablity and quality.,"This is an OK read for those wanting a brief introduction to reliability. However, there are no complex equations or theories that go significantly into the body of knowledge of reliability engineering. One gets a brief 120 page introduction to this complex topic. This serves the purpose of those who want the intro information. This would be a bad source to use on the CRE test. A good introduction to the subject and that is all.The writing was easy to follow. However, there were a large amount of either typos, or badly worded sentences in this book. The information was clear, but it was annoying to see words like itself spelled it self. Perhaps someone needed to check the final copy before print."
1,Forget it,"An incredibly elementary (vanity press?) review of the subject with an incredible number of errors, technical and grammatical. Only redeeming value is the low cost."
2,Not useful,Not suitable as an introduction. Even for an introduction it's too simple. It contains about 100 pages but could have been printed on 50 pages. Layout is unprofessional and images do not add information. Some images are in very bad quality too.
3,"A great track from OKC, plus two magnificent new songs.","Apart from the wonderful title track culled from Radiohead's musical masterpiece ""OK Computer,"" this single features two great songs previously unreleased: ""Polyethylene"" and ""Pearly*."" Don't let the askew time signature of ""Polyethylene"" distract you from its genius; it sounds reminescent of The Bends, only recorded OKC-style. ""Pearly*"" (and yes, that asterisk is part of the title) is another great song, often performed live on the tour in support of ""OK Computer."" Its mystic-sounding drum beat supports its surreal atmosphere. Pick up this disc if you're a Radiohead fan - these are two must-have songs!"
5,strade di loredana,this is one of the best tracks from babyberte' comeback album of one the most controversial italian singers with an amazing body of work.unfortunately like most great artist she has often been misunderstood and her legendary temper has kept major labels away...but babyberte' was autoproduced and tells a lifestory nothing short of extraordinary
5,This Rocks!,"I first heard Point Blank back in '76 when the first record came out. I bought it and thought it was great but for some reason kind of lost track of the band. I happened to find ""Second Season"" used at a record store locally 2 years ago and I think its awesome.Stand out tracks for me are ""Back in the Alley"", ""Uncle Ned"" and especially ""Tatooed Lady"", a personal favorite (I love the mean F# key its in). This of course is not the Rory Gallagher classic, Irish Tour '74 being a standout version, but its awesome just the same. I was in a cover band a year or so ago and wanted to play this song but I guess the singer couldn't cut it (or didn't like it).This album is a jam-along favorite for me as is the first album. I highly recommend this CD to any fan of Southern Rock or Blues Rock."
2,HC,"The machine can only show number of calls in single digits, so ""4"" could be 4 or 14 or 34.Other answering machines say ""you have 7 new calls and 40 saved calls.""On the 1738 unless you use time/date stamp you don't know which calls are old & which are new."
3,Halloween,The description said there were three movies in the dvd but there were only 2. I was some what disappointed but I love these classical movies
4,Perfect for sensitive skin,If you go on the web page that sells these the are $17 plus $10 shipping and handling Amazon had a great price. I use this in my salon and it is perfect for anyone with sensitive skin. it doesnt really make the skin red and moisturizes the skin as well
3,Ok but fragile,"The belts worked as expected but after buying a different brand, I noticed this brand ""junked"" up quickly and the belt was more fragile, breaking often.I recommend mercer abrasive premium belts instead. 100% different performance in those."
1,If you want christian/religious fiction...,"...this is the book for you. On the other hand, if you want to read about a time ""when teachers could change the world, when a stranger's help was graciously accepted and freely given, and a time when the promise of a bright future could capture the imagination and determination of any child."" you may have to tolerate a little preachy-ness.I gave this book only one star because of what I consider the devious way the book was presented. I expected a slice of Americana but got an excercise in feel-good faith reassurances instead. The way the story is presented isn't what the book is really about."
5,Translation as it ought to be,"This is an amazing translation of the poem. While most translators will convert the peice to prose, Raffel keeps to Chretien's original format and has developed a unique English poetic style to compliment the French. The translation captures all of Chretien's wit and playfulness by keeping the cadence of the poem light but never sing-songy. I cannot reccomend this translation enough!"
3,It was ok,I was not told that some stuff would be underlined throughout the text. Slightly annoyed but other than that it was ok. Fast shipping!!!
4,Must have for P fans,"Not as good as the clear, warm sound on the live half of Sweet Child, but this BBC sessions CD has the only live versions of many great tunes. PS: Solomon's Seal just came out on CD, so this is no longer the only place to hear some of those songs."
2,Hendrix does Cajun ?,"This was Not what I was expecting, defiantly not a traditional Cajun sound. In fact no Cajun sound at All. A Heavy beat and a Lot of electric guitar, If you're look'n for some trippy guitar this CD is for you. However if a more traditional pure'r Cajun sound with fiddle, accordion and non stop two step'n is what you're after you'll have to look elsewhere.."
5,A Beautiful Book,"The Blue Bear is a fantastic read! If you are at all interested in Alaska, nature, wildlife or friendship I am certain you will love this book."
5,What a wonderful story,I received this book from my husband for Xmas. I sat down to read and when I turned the last page a scant day and a half had passed.It was a magical story about the wildlife in Alaska but moreso the love and friendship between two men searching/waiting for magical moments when the right light or animal would wander into their viewfinder. The elusive Blue Bear was the unseen elastic that kept bringing these two friends together over the time it took to finally capture the bear. Life's lessons are too true when Lynn was robbed of sharing his great moment with his friend.I would recommend this book to anyone looking to lose about a day and a half to time well spent. I lost myself in a very good read and now am feeling at a loss when the last page has been turned and I am wishing there was at least another 1000 pages to go.
2,Over-rated,"As a great fan of nature books, I bought ""The Blue Bear"" after reading the glowing reivews. I grew bored with it after about half of the book. While some of the writing is indeed superb, and some of the moments are unforgettable, the narrative wanders all over the place and seems to lose its focus. I learned virtually nothing about the glacier bear, which was disappointing, and very little about Michio Hoshino. Lynn Schooler, on the other hand, spends a lot of time talking about himself. I think the book's title should have been, ""Man Runs Away From Life And Blue Bear Shows Up At the End"". This doesn't come close to my favorite book about Alaska, Barry Lopez's intelligent and sensitive ""Arctic Dreams"". A big disappointment."
1,Do not buy this to coach 4-6 year olds,"I bought this to get ideas on how to coach a 6 year old soccer team. This video may be a fine soccer coaching video, and the host comes across as a fine soccer coach, but he is coaching 10-13 year old kids in this video. 6 year old kids learning the game need to learn very basic soccer skills and the rules of the game. This entire DVD consists of drills and instruction for older kids who have already developed intermediate soccer skills. While a few of the drills can be adapted for younger kids, it is largely wasted on 4-6 year olds.The title is deceiving and dishonest, and I cannot recommend this product."
4,"Informative, but Long","As a whole, this was a very informative math book. Just make sure you don't try and read it all in a couple of days. It's possible, but mentally exhausting with a book this long! Great review for my differential equations course!"
5,The ODE Bible,"Examples upon examples, each barely different from the one before, worked out in extreme detail with all those obvious steps ...So why is it a five? Because I cannot give a six! Because my teachers made simple things complicated and Tenenbaum and Pollard make it look so easy and smooth. Because anybody with some Calculus background can pick this book up and understand ordinary differential equations."
2,buy a different differential book,"This book is written as if they had to squeeze as many words on a page as they could. It is hard to read, the examples given in the lessons are so much more simple than the actual problems that they don't help. If you can follow the example in the lesson it doesn't necessarily mean you can do the problems. Buy a book that was printed at least in the last decade. The only reason I bought this was because it was required for my class."
5,Perfect reference!,Great gift for a new believer or a friend who needs a hand sorting ideas. I usually purchase 5 each year and give them away.
3,Connections,"This book,like many childrens' books would suffer without the great illustrations. The vibrant cover had set my hopes high for good story to read my daughter. I was left feeling, is that it? The art is fun, I'm sure the illustator could have written it just as well by himself."
3,A nice read,"When Anna overhears a discussion about Aunt Julie's wedding, she learns she is to be the flower girl. Oh, no! Anna doesn't believe that weddings are fun for kids. She would rather ride her bike, climb trees or go swimming.Anna decides to hide in the attic until after the wedding. While watching from her secret hiding place in the attic, Anna sees Aunt Julie, her mother and grandmother pull a gown and veil out of old boxes - and she begins to imagine how it would feel to be a bride. She wants to try on the beautiful things. Maybe Anna is changing her mind about weddings. No, she would still rather play outside than be a flower girl.Flower Girl, by Kathy Furgang is a storybook for children 4-8 years of age. It is a nice story that youngsters will enjoy reading and Harley Jessup's delightful drawings will keep them turning the pages."
5,Love the UK Nestle Kat Kats!,"Try them side by side against the Hershey made US version. Nestle's uses a different formulation for its milk chocolate that makes their bars superior to Hershey's (in my humble opinion).The only downside is that to get these, one must order from a 3rd party supplier in the UK. Delivery is measured in weeks instead of days. Also, be aware that the Kit Kats do not come in a 24 pack carton in an insulated container. You get 24 bars loosely packed in a box with styrofoam noodles. Don't order by mail in warm weather months or you'll get a melted chocolatey mess."
4,Nice flick,"I'm a guy who watched this because of high ratings and weekend sale price on Amazon. I liked it a lot. Zac's character offers a great demonstration of patience, perseverance and strength. If you'd like to see a good way of how to handle a bully, you'd do we'll to check out this film, for that alone. Again, nice story. Blessings"
4,Really like it,"I really like this movie. I feel like it has some gaps in the story line, like it doesn't flow great. Other than that I really like it."
5,Good Movie,Loved the Book and loved the movie. I watch it a lot and have recommended it to many of my friends
5,love!,this product came in very fast. i deff love it. i recommend this movie to anyone. such a good story
5,TRUE ROMANCE,"Her photograph saves his life and he saves her life after he finds her. The added element of her brother dying saving his fellow soldier and Zac's character witnessing his heroic action, so that she could come to peace with his death was very sensitive."
4,Cute movie,"i like Zac Efron. Movie was interesting. He plays quiet silent type. Digital copy went on ultraviolet, easy download/access mobile or computer."
4,self,I ought this movie because the previews looked like it was good. It was a good movie. Glad I got it
4,The Lucky One,"I really enjoyed this movie on my iPad, I enjoy everything I get from AmaOn. They are very fair in price. I shop on Amazon every chance I get. Thank you for a new way to watch my moves on my iPad . I am a senior citizen and evenings in my bed with a good movie on my iPad is a great comfort. Thank you once again Amazon. Patricia R. Stanley. Product link I donor understand what you want."
2,The Notebook II,"If you enjoyed the Notebook, you'll enjoy this one. Just don't expect much of a different storyline. Imagery was good, beautiful setting, actors were easy on the eyes... but it lacked believability in terms of the main characters' chemistry."
2,Not family friendly film,"I do not recommend this film. There is language and other stuff that I could do without. Also, some bad acting by the main characters. However, this story was believable and it was very serious about respecting the military veterans, I think."
3,Pretty and Predictable but that's what I expected,"Zac Efron is hot - no doubt - his co- star- forget her name but she's a Leo ;-) is beautiful as well and it's really nice to in my bed where I view my movies pretending that this could happen to me. The only thing i could see as a likelihood with be having a dog named Zeus. It's predictable, stereotyped and cliched BUT? It's heart - the movie's heart is in the right place - of course the book was written by Nicholas Sparks..(aka The Notebook) is a romantic soul and he can afford to be. Bottom line? If you have the money? It's worth the time to watch it. If not? NO big losss."
2,The Lucky One,"Acting was so so and Zac was good looking enough, but there was very little chemistry between the two. Story was weak and poor character development."
1,worst plot ever,The writer is trying to make an issue between the main characters so that they have that perfect moment where she realized he is the most important. Give me a break. write some good movies and step out of the box of writing the same plot all the time.
4,Cute movie!,"It's not as good as The Notebook or Dear John but it's cute. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it, and I didn't. Thank you Amazon!"
4,Very good romance movie.,"Really enjoyed the movie, a little bit out there on some things, but I enjoyed it. Really liked the actors."
5,great movie,Bought it watched it liked it. Thought it was a great movie. You will enjoy it too so do see The Lucky One.
3,The Lucky One,"When the preview first came out, I really thought this movie would be a dud and it looked like there would be a lack of chemistry between the two main characters. But my granddaughter told me she thought it was awesome and I should watch it, so I did. It is really good and has a different way of telling the usual boy meets girl story and the chemistry is great between all the characters. If you like touching memorable love stories, then you will like this. This goes a little slow in the beginning but don't give up."
3,Cliche,Not terrible but pretty cliche. Not a strong performance by Zach Effon. The war scenes were done very well-too bad the rest of the movie was not as captivating.
3,Good chick flick,"This has all of the things you want in a Nicholas Sparks movie - hot guy who's misunderstood and a slowly unwinding love story set in a beautiful Southern location, with a bonus cute dog, too. My only complaint would be that Taylor, the female lead character, seemed a bit too old for Zac Efron. But maybe I was just wishing it was me instead :)"
3,"Not ""The Notebook""","I think I'll always compare Sparks movies to ""The Notebook"" This wasn't as good, but it's okay if you're looking for a romance."
3,The Lucky One,"The storyline was okay, but something that has been done before. The characters were not very developed (maybe they are in the book?) and the acting was stiff on Zac Efron's part. The two lead actors/characters did not have much chemistry together. The supporting cast did a good job; especially the little boy, grandma and ex-husband. It wasn't bad for $4 but I wouldn't get it again. The Notebook (another movie made from a Sparks novel) was much better so if you haven't seen it yet I would watch that instead of The Lucky One."
2,Billiejopa,"Love story, usual chick flick. Mediocre acting by Zephron. Predictable story. Fine if you have nothing better to do.like on a long flight.Scenery beautiful, may be redeeming factor.."
3,Story good acting bad,"""The lucky one"" had a good story line that was interesting and fun. Turns out that the acting was horrible. The German Shepard probably was the best actor in the movie."
2,Didn't like it!,I only finished the movie caust I paid for it. Very slow and predictable I would not reccomend this move.
2,Hallmark Channel special!,"This was a Hallmark Channel special at best, how did this make it into theaters?? Not horrible but ...... even my girlfriend thought it was a dud."
1,Only Blu-ray copy,I love this movie and bought the blu-ray version so I could have two copies of it. Unfortunately I didn't realize unlike most Blu-ray movies you purchase it only came with the Blu-ray movie version. I wanted it to watch in my kitchen but that player is just a basic one and won't play this movie. :(
3,"Bad Character choice, the book was better",The book was better. If you haven't read it then you should. I did not like the people they chose to play the characters. When I was reading the book I invisioned it differently.
3,Not bad for a chick flick,"Rented this as a chick flick for the wife. While it is most definatly a chick flick, it had enough action and intriguing enough story to keep me entertained as well. While this type of movie are not my favorite, I did enjoy it."
5,Such a great movie!,"I had read the book and loved it, so I was hoping the movie was just as good and it did not disappoint. Anyone who loves a good love story should watch this movie!"
4,movie,Very romantic and a plot that moved along well and made sense. The scenes were engaging and the story line was interesting.
4,Effects of War,"The trauma that our recent and current wars have on young men who fight and the struggle to heal. It is a film that those who encourage war in Political leaders particulary in our senate and congress who nave no sonsor daughter see and ask to you really think war is worthmthis pain if you do why don't they enlist and go?A film odf reflection, not the best but certainly a good attempt!"
5,The Lucky One,"If you are looking for a really good movie to enjoy I would recommend The Lucky One. It has many aspects, and emotions and some humor too."
3,Fully Romantic!!!,"Very hard to believe, but oh well, is a nice quaint love story, cute. Adults viewers only. Teenagers will never get it."
3,Good Movie,The movie was entertaining. I read the book and the movie was not as interesting. Zac Efron is a good actor.
3,It was good,"this is one of those movies you are so excited to see and although it was good it let me down a little, needless to say if I seen it on tv i may watch it ..."
3,Chick Flick,Definitely something to watch with your girl. Nothing much to comment on other than the great posture Zac has throughout the movie.
2,A bit disappointed.,"I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks and have loved most of his books and the movies that follow. However, this will now be considered my least favorite of his movies. I thought that the characters lacked any ""spark"" or real chemistry. I wanted to like her but didn't. I have not seen any of her work previously but was not a fan of her now. This movie is also my first movie watching Zac and again. I am not a fan of him.What i did take away from the story itself was how he handled his situations. He manages to handle almost all of the things thrown at him with so much dignity. It made me thinking about how i can handle things better in my life. Her ex pushes him and at times i can't believe he doesn't' punch him. But he holds his emotions in check well. So as much as i love the story line itself. I wish they had picked stronger actors..."
3,It could have been better,Not one of his best books or movies. I was kind of disappointed. But the book was a bit more entertaining than the movie.
3,Decent,Wasn't as horrible as I thought it was going to be when my girl decided we needed to watch it together.
3,Chick Flick,"Yes, a movie that is exactly what you would expect. A pure chick flick with pretty people and a sweet ending delivered in a bow. Nice with a bottle of wine and your girlfriends."
3,It's okay,"It was watchable. I was in the mood for romance and wasn't sorry about the 3.99, but am I glad I saw it? Nope."
3,Not as good as the book,"It's a good chick flick, if you've got an extra couple of hours and just want to chill. It would be much better if you ""don't"" read the book first."
4,Cute movie if you like Nicholas Sparks,"As all Sparks books, this movie is somewhat predictable, but all in all a feel good movie and just what I was looking for on a night when my husband was out of town."
5,Great deal,Great deal! This was a great value and shipped fast. I recommend this good movie. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5,The Lucky One (DVD+UltraViolet Digital Copy),I love this movie. I bought it unseen and only reviewed and am very happy with the film. I would recommend it to others. Thanks
4,The Lucky One,Touching love story about people with challenges - like real life. This is my 2nd time watching it. It's not a classic like Jane Eyre but you'll certainly want to revisit it. I think I'll buy it!
4,Quality Movie,"Nice story, enjoyed watching it with my husband. Hard to find quality entertainment these days...but this was a wholesome good flick."
3,"great story, many flaws",It was a great love story but it wasn't amazing compared to the Notebook. The story was to predictable and there was very little conflict for the protagonist. The antagonist was very predictable as well and unrealistic.
4,Worth watching,"I enjoyed this film. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it kept my attention andwas enjoyable."
4,It was good,"Kinda predictable. But still a sweet story. i rented it at home, then decided to buy it for myself as a stocking stuffer."
4,CHICK FLICK,this movie is pure chick flick. in a good way! It also had some action involved so that keep my husband's attention too. I really enjoyed it. and Zac Efron doesn't hurt the movie at all!
4,Great Movie,A great romantic drama adapted from the Nicholas Sparks novel.If you're in the mood for a good chick flick this is a great choice!
4,the lucky one,"I liked this movie, some parts seemed like they drug on for a few extra minutes but for the most part it was good."
4,Zac is all grown up!,"He loves animals and kids, can fix a broken gutter and can get the old boat running. He can even play the piano! He is also a hunk who just shows up in Louisiana with his dog. The locals are skeptical but leave it to Blythe Danner to start the ball rolling. This is a Lifetime type movie which is very watchable on a rainy Sunday. Keep some tissues handy. Zac could smile more but is quite good as an ex-Marine with PTSD. I watched it twice."
5,Wow again.,"Get out your Kleenex folks and get prepared for a movie that touches your heart in many ways, those who are dying overseas, love, faith, determination and destiny. This is probably the best movie I've seen since ""On Golden Pond"" and will likely be in the same category forever. It will make you laugh, make you cry, give you encouragement, and make you angry - but lastly, will make you happy in life and all its memories - good and bad. The message? You only live once, so make the best of the life you have. You never know when yours ends or those of whom you love the most. A definite 5 star production, with excellent film quality. Don't forget the Kleenex - you will need it. Me? I blubbered all over my pillowcase. Now it's time to change it. Wish I'd had my Kleenex...Be well, all."
3,"Decent, albeit predictable story, bad acting","I read the book before I saw the movie, so of course that probably made me a bit skeptical from the start, but the details changed to adapt the book to a screenplay didn't change too much of the story. Zac Efron was not the right guy for the part of Logan, though. He was dull, stiff, and had no personality. Any kind of sexual tension or mystery with Logan or between him and Beth just didn't come across. Maybe with someone else playing the part of Logan it could have been a better movie, but if I hadn't read the book before I saw the movie and gotten a better feel for the characters' backgrounds, I think I would have been really bored."
3,Great movie but the digital copy is really poor quality.,"While I really liked this movie. I am really disappointed with the quality of the digital copy that comes with the DVD. I am not someone who gets everything in super HD quality, I have several movies in digital form and all of them are standard definition and I they have been fine. This digital copy is HORRIBLE it is actually pixilated. This is the first digital copy I have bought that requires the Flixer player so I am not sure if it is the player or the digital download. If you really want the digital copy I wouldn't get it this way."
1,barf city,Amazon needs to include a vomit bag as well as a split screen with a better movie playing side by side.
1,"Did not download, no customer service help.","I tried to rent this movie through Amazon.com, but got a message from Amazon that said I could not watch the movie on my mobile device. I was very surprised to read an email receipt the next day, showing a charge for a movie that Amazon would not let me watch. Next, I contacted Amazon customer service, but I was not refunded the charge. Buyer beware!"
2,The Lucy One,I loved the book years ago but it just did not transfer well as a movie. The acting was poor and it seemed more like a cheesy soap opera.
1,terrible,Expect it to be terrible and you might make it through this one. By far Sparks worst movie to date.
5,Nicholas Sparks....,"I do believe that is the only comment that needs to be made here. They did a pretty good job, I of course read the book first so I love the book a little more. Wonderful soundtrack too."
4,Fun,"If you like fun, romantic movies...this will satisfy your needs! Lol! Well done, and well acted, which always helps too!"
5,Excellent movie,Zachary Efron is so good looking and does fabulous in this movie. Mic you love nicholas sparks books you will love this movie!
4,"From what I have heard, it is worth watching.","Sorry! I never got a chance to finish it, but I heard it was a good movie. I will rent it again."
3,"Eh, just another formulatic film","What's there to say about this movie? Nothing really... It wasn't great but it wasn't horrible either. Just kinda blah... The story isn't original, the performances aren't spectacular. I really think that this film was just made in the hopes that all of Zac Efron's fans would flock to the theaters.I think Zac is a likable actor who's got talent but this movie was just okay. I kinda felt like this movie was trying very hard to be the 2012 version of The Notebook but it failed miserably.If you wanna kill an afternoon and you literally have no other options then I'd say watch it. You probably won't ever want to watch it again and you probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend but it wasn't the worst movie I've seen."
3,Good movie better book.,Before I start I just want you to know I read the book prior to seeing the movie. I was so excited when I saw the trailer for this movie on TV. It looked SO good. When I watched it I was not impressed. The acting was good but the story line didnt make any sense like it did in the book. In the book everything makes sense! I really recommmend reading this book AFTER watching the movie. It explains so much more about how he came to find the picture and how Victor played a HUGE role in logans life before he went to find beth. Beths sons HATES his dad. He writes GREAT books but the movies get all messed up.
3,Average chemistry,I usually love movies made from Nicholas Spark's novels but this one was only average to me. The storyline was very interesting but I never could quite buy into the chemistry between characters.
2,Same old story line,"Bad acting, basically all I can say. Efron has an expressionless face, and his acting is expressionless as well. Boring."
3,The Lucky One,I think the book was much better but Zac Efron was definitely fun to watch in this movie. The Lucky One isn't one of Nicholas Sparks tearjerkers but it's still pretty good.
1,Junk,Movie wasn't Good at all. Don't pay more than $1.99 to rent it. The acting was kind of terrible. Not a good chick flick.
2,Didn't follow along with the book...,"Very disappointed in this movie. After just reading the book recently there were so many differences. I like a based-on-book-movie to at least follow the book even in the small details like where the story took place...Should have been NC, but in the movie it was Louisiana. The acting and cast wasn't up to par for me either...Oh well. I really enjoyed the book--the movie? Not so much!"
3,"so, so","story okay, zac seems a little young for part,not good chemistry between stars. not as good as the Notebook movie."
3,Unpleasant but Ok Ending,This movies deals with unpleasantness. Efrons personality in this movie is not my fav but he is good at potraying a diff personality than I have seen him. Would not recommend for kids.
3,Just doesn't have the dramatic spark of other films of this type,"Besides the predictable joining of the protagonist with his lady love, the story line itself does not have the dramatic tension of other films of this type. It is too predictable with the divorced husband not providing enough edge, enough to push against, for the love story to be anything other than ordinary. Zac Efron has a gorgeous face and chiseled body as expected but not enough emotional range to carry his role successfully. I enjoyed the landscape and the setting and, perhaps, a National Geographic special just showing the Louisiana countryside would have provided entertainment enough without this lame story. Veterans especially deserve better."
1,horrible just horrible- would have given it a half star.,Poorly acted.... very poorly. The war scenes were horribly done. Just wasnt a believable movie.and I in general like to look at Zach Effron. But this movie was more then i could stand to watch even with that bonus.Dissapointed in the movie as a whole.and didnt live up to the other Nicholas Sparks book movies
3,"Ok, clean cut.","I'd say this is a family style movie as the love connection between the actors is kind of pure and sweet. The acting wasn't the greatest, but it was an OK story."
3,Good but not great,Worth the time and money due to great storyline but I just didn't like the casting for the couple. Loved the kid and grandmother though.
4,Sweet,This was a great love story. One that both my husband and I both enjoyed! Would highly recommend to those looking for a romantic movie to share with that special someone.
5,The lucky one,"Zac Efrom is all grown up ! This Is his best film , yet !!! , He can sing , he can dance & he can act , he's one of the few young actor's of this generation , I can see an Oscar , an Emmy , a Tony & a Grammy ( or Many of them in his future ) ZAC EFROM IS THE BEST !!!"
4,"Good movie, but not like the book.",The movie is really good but the differences from the book kind of bugged me to much to really enjoy it and give it 5 stars. My recommendation is to watch the movie first and then read the book and you won't be disappointed.
4,Love it,Nicholas Sparks strikes again with this wonderful love story. I absolutely loved it! Zac Efron does a wonderful job at portraying his character and is very easy on the eyes in this movie.
4,Nice Romance,Nothing out of the ordinary. Nicholas-Sparks kind of nice romance. Begins in a funny way with a guy taking pictures of girls on a beach and you know he's a cop. Oooo! Political mess up. Then it becomes a nice readable romance recipe.
5,Very Nice Movie,"I have no problems with this movie at all. It is a nice story, beautifully acted, and it is filled with all of the elements that a romance is supposed to have. Thank God I am not too cynical to appreciate that."
4,I give the movie four stars.,"The movie was very good. Just as good as the book. I would recomend the movie and the book.Cordiually Yours,Sharon Boyd"
4,Good chick flick,"Zach Efron is great. The story line is just okay to me. It wasn't terrible though. I loved Zach Efron in it, he's the reason to watch it!"
4,the lucky one,"Romantic, fun, non-violent. Very good acting. Shows just what happens to some solders who return from active duty, the problems that many share."
4,Great Sappy Romance,"If you're looking for a sappy chick flick romance this is for you. A story about a veteran suffering from ptsd who wonders why he was spared when so many others weren't. He finds a pic of a woman and when he comes home after trying to fit in at home and not succeeding he sets out on a journey to find the woman in the picture that he feels saved him from dying. Much drama and romance ensues, but it's a worthy story. Be sure to have a hanky on hand as there may be a couple of tearful moments. This is definitely NOT a comedy, so if that's what you're looking for then pass this one by."
3,Rented movie,"I really can't rate this movie. I purchased it for my Kindle to take on vacation, but did not get to watch it before the rental expired."
1,Disappointed,"The movie was interesting the first time through. Acting good, locations interesting, but after that, the movie would come to a stop in different locations and start over all on it own. Tried playing it on different machines with the same results. Good movie, but quality of DVD questionable."
1,Bling Bling,I did not want the movie in this format. When I realized I made a mistake I could not change my order. I have never watched the movie. Not only did I waste money on this purchase. I never saw the movie I was looking forward to.
4,Great movie,Heart touching movie on dealing with hurry and lost in life. ... ... ... ... ... . . . . . ... . . . ....
4,enjoyable,"Similar to your other romance 3 party movies; 1 bad guy, two fallen lovers can't be together etc. However as far as Nicolas Sparks goes and I like his books a lot it was not, better than some, not all."
4,The Lucky One,This Movie was worth its weight in gold. All my emotions were used from Happy to Sad and Anger when watching. Makes us all feel that love and luck are still alive...:)
4,What a moving love story,"This is a beautiful story about love, about dedication, about honor and loss. I was moved by it, and easily can recommend the DVD to all the women and men who feel that love stories are wonderful to read or watch. Buy it or rent it, you will enjoy it while holding the hand of your girl."
3,Not bad. She was wrong for the role,"It was predictable story, but that was expected.The only problem was the casting of Taylor, she was not right for the role. A younger more likable personality would have improved this movie a lot. Im 42, she looked like she is my age. (If your offended by that, too bad) There was no chemistry with Zack, who has a likable screen presence,Other than that casting was good.A little hokie but not a bad movie."
2,We agreed...,"My wife went with me to see 007 so I owed her one, but even my my wife hated it. We were so bored we both almost gave up half way through, but we stuck it out just hoping it would get better. It didn't. This is one of the few movies we agreed on. I wouldn't suggest anyone watch this movie."
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for this film since the book was so great, but it was a let-down. The directing was sloppy; there were too many poor transitions. Not to mention that Zeus, the dog, disappears at the end of the film and never reappears again. How do you forget to include the dog in the ending? The chemistry between the two main characters wasn't great, and neither was Zac Efron's acting, although I know he's capable because I've seen him act well before. This leads me to question again whether it was just the poor directing, and not necessarily Efron's poor acting abilities.I feel like directors sometimes view Nicholas Sparks's stories as a guarantee for instant box-office success (and understandably so, since most of his novels are terrific), however in doing so they fail to actually put in a solid effort when creating the film, which is a shame because the story-lines have such potential."
2,The Lucky One,"Cheesy, Hallmark Network movie...predictable throughout. Ok, if mindless entertainment is what you are seeking. Enough said, however, this review requires 20-words."
2,Cheesy and miscast!,"I wasn't the lucky one since I actually rented this and watched it online. Zac Efron is believable as the leading man, but the leading lady wasn't his match. She looked too old and wasn't attractive enough to play the love interest of such a handsome leading man. The story was cheesy and predictable. The sex scenes looked awkward and I didn't see any chemistry between the lead actors. Efron's acting at times was as weird as Kirsten Stewart's acting in all of the Twilight movies. ""The Lucky One"" will appeal to hopeless romantics who enjoy a love story no matter what. I wanted to know more about Zac Efron's character and see more of the bayou culture...so many scenes with the dogs!!!"
4,Good Movie,"I read the book, thought I'd see how it came out on the big screen. Good movie to watch. Would definitely recommend it."
4,Good Movie,I bought this for my mother-in-law as a gift. Was able to get it for a great price but took way too long to be shipped. Arrived shortly after being shipped but took quite some time to be sent out.
4,I liked it,"Great story, no violence, nudity, profanity, a movie everyone can watch and enjoy. I would recommend this movie to anyone"
5,Nicholas Sparks,Good book.Good movie.Enjoyable with friends.Story is believable.Invite your friends to see it for popcorn night.Go
4,The Lucky One,"I was asked to join my wife in seeing this film, knowing that it was a chick film as they say, for me it was a very good film, good story, scenery was magnificent, actors were good, overall a film worth seeing, and again when it comes out on DVD."
4,Well done romance.,"A marine in Iraq discovers a woman's photo, and the circumstances of the find save his life. He survives the tour and sets out to find her. Upon locating the lady, a romance ensues, in spite of her jealous ex-husband and the marine's failure to reveal why he has shown up. This is another Nicholas Sparks romance adapted for the big screen, and it is perhaps the best one yet. The film contains all the classic hallmarks of a romance: a handsome hero, a beautiful lady, a villain, and steamy romantic sequences. Men should enjoy the efforts of the film's quiet and strong protagonist to seek out his destiny, while women will like the tale of a strong woman who is struggling with a bullying ex and her feelings for the newcomer. This is a good movie for an evening out with your significant other."
2,Book is better,"This movie was disappointing. Grant you the lead male actor is definitely easy on the eyes, but did not fit the part. He was too young to properly portray the lead. The movie left to many questions open and did not explain enough. I read the book so I knew the reasons, but those who have not will be left with questions."
1,The Lucky One,"I loved the book!! Loved is a small word, couldn't wait for it to be turned into a movie. Almost all of Nicholas Sparks' books turned out as great movies. When I finally got to rent this movie, I was disappointed. There was no chemistry between the characters, it looked like it was forced. Zac Efron was not the best person to play Thibult. He looked like a child with a mother lover. I was so not into the movie I even left the room from time to time not caring what happened. Biggest disappointment ever! Best book and worst movie remake!!"
4,Worth Watching!,The movie was enjoyable. I watched it from the beginning to the end. I couldn't leave the room. I wanted to see what happened to the characters. Worth watching!
4,Sweet story,"This movie was a bit predictable but enjoyed it none the less. I thought that the subject of post traumatic stress would have made this very difficult to watch, but it was handled gracefully. While it is a very serious subject, it was nice to see this soldier was able to move on."
3,The book is much better,The book was much better. I didn't like how many things changed in the movie. Also don't know that I loved who they had as the leads in the movie.
3,Ok,"As usual, the book is better. Not sure why I even bother with the movies. I'm always left feeling like something is missing."
4,The Lucky One,Love story. Fairly touching. Happy ending. Good acting. Bought it as a gift for someone that is more of a romantic than I am.
2,Romantic Drama,"I liked the premise of the movie - military veteran rebuilds his life after devastating losses, meets girl, falls in love, etc., etc. Almost too cheesy, however. I don't think the chemistry between the actors was so great either."
2,Not a favorite.,The acting is not so good. The story is sweet and is a fine movie if you don't expect much from the acting.
3,Could not get UltraViolet Digital to download,"Movie was good, but the product was the problem. I could not get the UltraViolet Digital to download, no where near the expiration date yet said it had hit the limit."
3,Love story like any other,"It was a good gushy love story with a typical ending. It was exactly what I was expecting, and I enjoyed it."
3,"predictable, but mildly entertaining","im not going to say I wasn't engaged with this movie, but I feel like ive seen it all before. also, the actors chemistry was barely there. I kinda felt like she would have been better suited to play his mom."
2,A case where the book was better than the movie,"Most of the movies made from Nicholas Sparks' books are really good. I loved this book, but the movie, not so much. I usually end up crying with his stories and I figured this movie would be no exception, but it just wasn't that good to me. Maybe because the main characters didn't seem to have much chemistry on screen as in the book."
3,He sure is a lucky one,I would say this movie is ok. I wasn't too impress though as I expect more on this movie. It was a bit boring...
3,Not too bad.,"Although this isn't one of my favorite movies, it was a nice, easy, and entertaining movie to watch. Worth a watch."
3,The Lucky One,We felt the movie was very predictable. It seemed to have a fairly week plot that just didn't seem believable.
3,Really lucky.,"You'll be the lucky one if you show this movie to your girlfriend and you provide some champagne and crackers with some cheese and maybe light a few candles??? Then again, you might not have a significant other and you won't be so lucky, because you will get very depressed that you are alone and you have to drink all that champagne by yourself. Looks like an early night in bed for you unless you're an alcoholic and two bottles of champagne don't even phase you."
2,"Boring, boring, boring",I'm a fan of Nichols Sparks and loved Message in a Bottle and The Notebook. But this movie was boring. I didn't buy the chemistry between the two leads which just made the movie drag. My wife said the movie differed quite a bit from the book and said the movie would have been better if they would have followed the book more closely.
2,Fair to halfass,"Was not all that impressed. However, i do not believe i fall into the target market with this movie. 36 yr old male. Women ages 16-40 may enjoy this movie."
2,Overrated,"I love other Nicolas Sparks movies like The Notebook, Dear John, but for some reason this one didn't do it for me. Wanted to see it in the theater even, but glad I waited for home rental."
3,"It was Ok, but it sure wasnt ""The Notebook""","I rented this as i seen the writer/ or director or who-ever was the same as the Notebook. So i rented it, and this movie just barely kept my attention. I wont bore you with a long narrative other than saying I yawned.. for a buck out of the redbox it was ok, No way would i recomend buying this movie.."
1,pathetic,Acting was very poor. Almost the entire crew made me feel embarrassed. Puppy faces with genetic bad guys. The production should have been scrapped.
3,just okay,"It was okay. Truthfully, I hadn't had high hopes for it, but I'm a Zac Efron fan and thought I'd check it out. It was good enough to watch but I probably won't buy it and watch it again and again."
2,Sparks predictable,"Okay, but to similar and predictable to other Nicholas Sparks books made into movies. Nothing new and exciting here, wish I would have rented instead of purchasing."
3,No 'Spark',"I read the book just before watching the movie. Of course I knew there would be differences. I usually can appreciate that each one has to stand on its own. I wanted to love the movie, but just felt it was so so. Nicholas Sparks writes great characters. In the movie I just didn't think the two main actors had any chemistry. I felt Zac Efron was more believable as the stoic marine, but Taylor Schilling didn't look or sound like a girl from a small town Louisiana.I found it extremely ironic to see the title of the special feature was ""Zac and Taylor's Amazing Chemistry"", as if they were trying hard to convince the audience it was there."
4,good romantic movie,"The movie didn't follow the book very closely but it was pretty good for a love story. Its the kind of movie that would make the regular guy feel incompetent so I wouldn't watch this with my hubby...he hates ""chick flicks."""
5,very good,I love this movie. It keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen next. I was so surprised when I saw the price. Amazon was the cheapest. I was so excited I could not wait for it to come.
2,Saccharine Chick Flick,"I wanted to like this one, but there just was not enough there. This is not a bad movie, understand. It is, in fact, a very conventional and (I have to say it) stereotypical chick flick. Impossibly gorgeous Taylor Schilling is recently divorced from a county Sheriff, and has an impossibly cute 8 year old son. Incredibly handsome Zac Efron is a Marine returning home after three deployments who seeks her out based upon a picture of her that he kept as a lucky talisman in combat. (Long story, but the film does tell it.) Guys will hope for the conclusive showdown between the Marine and the Sheriff, but, well, more would be telling. Suffice to say that this film is an easy way to pass 101 minutes, but that is about it.Taylor Schilling is very, very, easy on the eyes. By the way, the wise old grandmother (Ellie, played by Blythe Danner) is pretty easy on the eyes too.If you want a non-violent chick flick, this one is for you. RJB."
4,Awesome Movie,This is one of the best love stories in quite a while. The plot of the soldier being saved by the shinning light and then searching for the girl in the picture was moving...again great story and awesome cinematography.
4,Love the Movie,"Love the movie - could watch it over & over again. A bit disappointed though with this UltraViolet Digital Copy. I was excited for the price and assumed I'd be able to put this on my iPod for when I travel into Boston on a regular basis, but it's not compatible with your iPod."
4,Loved the book,This movie was ordered as a Christmas gift for our son's wife. I haven't watched it personally but I did read the book and loved it! I may have to borrow this one after she watches it.
5,Lucky One Movie,I love this movie. Great Bought it for a gift. So I received it in time. Wish I could have got a better price.
4,Predictable plot but enjoyable film,"If you're looking for a standard chick flick with a dose of eye candy, this movie is for you. Zac Efron is extremely easy on the eyes, even if you can predict how the film will end. I'd watch it again, which is saying something."
5,GREAT FILM!,Love Nicholas Sparks and love this film! So well done! Can not wait to watch it over and over again!
2,Mandatory Package College Algebra with Trigonometry with Smart CD (Windows),"This book was confusing. I found descrepancies. It really frustrated me. If you are an online student, good luck with this book. You will definately need tutoring."
1,Not what i expected,"I was looking to buy ""College Algebra with Trig"", but i recieved the ""Student Solutions manual instead. Nowhere on this page does it say it is just the answers to the book. Beware - don't spend 60 dollars if this is not what you're looking for. Now i have to try and get my money back."
3,Enjoyable.,"CLAMP, xxxHolic vol. 2 (Del Rey, 2004)Some new characters and a better idea of where the story arc is going make this a stronger volume overall than the first, but there's still something about it that bugs me. I can't quite put my finger on what, but it's something in the tone; too flighty? Maybe. But it's still enjoyable enough, and so I still keep reading it. ***"
5,Hd cable for original xbox,Great component ( and svideo if needed) connector for original xbox. Unfortunately Hdmi didn't exist for xbox1. The pic quality is nice in games support hd rez. Very affordable.
4,Great product with a fatal problem,"The cable works just fine. The picture quality is far greater than the standard cable, and the price is excellent in comparison to the official upgrade. The only problem is that the optical (digital) sound output doesn't work properly when you use the S-Video part of this cable. The Xbox doesn't regester it as being a digital out, and only does stereo. However if you plan on using the component out it works just fine. [why it regesters as digital when the switch is set to component, but not s-video is beyond me...]"
4,good cables,"Got these to bring a little bit of new life into the old xbox. While things are by no means ""hd"" which the xbox doesn't do anyways, it does give a noticeable step up in picture quality over the stock cables. Worth the little bit of cash these cost."
4,This part number is for a PAIR not each so you only need one!,"I ordered two since the brake assembly on the 8274 winch has one on each side of the brake wheel (this is how it looked on the exploded view), and ended up with a total of four. $18 did seem kind of expensive for each disc."
5,Love it,"Great product, evens tone in a few washes. I had discoloration on my forehead and around my mouth. This product has help dramatically."
5,Nice soap,"After using this product, I do see a difference in my breakouts and in my acne scars on my face. It does seem to dry out your skin, but I use a moisturizer on my skin after use. My face seems to be less red than it was before also."
4,"Beautiful Boleros, beautiful voice!!","This guy can sing till you have fallen in love. Beautiful Boleros, and great interpretation. He should sing latin jazz...."
5,Songs by Ricky was Great But...,"Rick Nelson (Songs by Ricky), whom I saw once, three months before he died, he was a great singer, and I think at one time or another I had all his songs and records, and this new record like so many of his albums they are putting out now, like other singers, they all add this bonus crap on to the album thinking its so great, that when you sit down to listen to the originals on the album you got this stuff that interfers with the moods, they should leave a good thing alone. Dennis L. Siluk"
2,"broken, but still smells good.","i tried ordering this from the perfumeguys but they sent the wrong item, then said they were out of stock and would give me a refund which i never got. so i ordered here instead and received a worn out looking thing with a broken nozzle which i superglued back on. it was still full and smelled like the one i had before."
2,"Great prose, horrible dialogue","Donovan is a poet, and his great skill is evident in the novel's prose. The narrator's descriptions of the landscape, its people, etc. are almost physically pleasant to read, and the words flow easily off the page.The dialogue, however, sounds almost like a child's story, and is quite overdone. It is a shame because of the quite real strenghts of the novel, but one's reading is best spent on other books."
3,ID holder,This case is ok if you want to put ID inside and keep it inside! It is very tight and it isn't easy to take stuff back out!
5,"ID badge, money, driver's license holder","I love my new ID holder...I no longer have to take a purse to hold my driver's license and money. I made a little sleeve to slip my money in to ""hide"" it from view - I place it between my ID and my license....it works great when I'm transporting patients and they no longer ask for money because they don't see me carrying a purse!!!!"
5,Works great,This works great for my purpose. I bought this to hold my Dog's License Card. Since she is my service dog now. So I can hang this around my neck for easy access to show people at stores she is allowed to be there. I hang it in my car in my rearview mirror when I'm not using it. Would recommend this to anyone who needs to carry cards or money in it.
5,very handy,Used to hold tickets while at Disney World with for wife and kids for ten days. Great way to keep items handy and waterproof for water rides and at waterparks.
3,Pithecanthropus,"The book contains a wealth of practical information however there are errors in the mathematical formulas, dates and etc. This is most frustrating from a reader point of view and dampened the confidence in the material presented. However, it is relatively a easy read for general understanding of the money and FX markets. I hope the author does a more thorough check in the future edition in order to do this book justice."
3,Trinity Knot and Claddagh Necklace,"Although the necklace is not as ""delicate"" as I had anticipate, very pretty. Excellent silver work, great value."
5,Great product!,"I've only been using it for a few weeks, but the lotion is thick and helps with the stretch marks I already have. I'm on my second child and have been using this lotion and bio oil right after i shower. I don't get to apply it 2x a day like you're suppose to, to save money & product but it works either way! It came through the mail in good timing and the product was well worth it!"
3,An alright product,I have been using this product since I was 7 months pregnant and it's been about 6 months and I have seen results but it's very little. This product works but has taken atleast 4 months to show any results.
4,Good product,"My wife really likes this brand of cosmetic products. It is really great for reducing stretch marks and preventingthe way they look. The smell isn't that great, and the consistency of the cream is not so liquid: people seem to like it like that, but unless you are an expert applying cream to large portions of your body, it means that you need to use more of it. Skin seems to absorbe it really well, though."
1,Yuk.,"The worst smell ever, I can't pass that. Plus it's not greasy but leaves weird feeling, like my skin doesn't breath. Palmer's olive and shea butter are so much better."
1,dont bother. waste of money,"I used this stuff twice daily since the moment I found out I was pregnant until I gave birth. My stomach got COMPLETELY covered in stretch marks...worse than I've ever seen. And for some reason I kept using it!! There are plenty of women that gain 70lbs when they're pregnant and don't get a single stretch mark because of their genes, not a lotion. The girls this ""worked"" for wouldn't have gotten stretch marks whether they used the cream or not I can guarantee that. Otherwise it would have done SOMETHING for me. Total letdown"
1,no results,"I used this product faithfully and saw no results. It doesnt work well for stretch marks that are old and highly doubt if they will work for new ones as well, save your money!!!"
1,Doesn't work,This didn't work at all. I have pretty bad stretch marks on my breasts and stomach. I used this religiously for almost 3 months straight and I haven't noticed any difference whatsoever. Plus it smells horrible!
1,Never saw results,"I started using this product when I was pregnant with my daughter. I used it daily on my belly, breasts, and underarms but still got tons of stretch marks. I continued using it for a year after my pregnancy and never saw any results. My stretch marks are still here with no lessening. The smells is yummy, and it makes your skin very soft, but I wish it actually made the stretch marks go away."
5,Light pink stretch marks,"I bought this product when I was in H.S. because I had stretch marks, light white ones, on the back of my knees. However, years later I noticed I had stretch marks, light pink ones, on my sides. I still had the same bottle so I decided to use it. Well, I love it. I never really used it before. But now that I am getting ready for a vacation in May, I thought I should be using it because I lost some weight and now I have the marks. I believe it really does work. My marks are much, much lighter and some are barely visible at all. I use it twice a day, everyday, and for about a week now. Great results."
1,Dangerous ingredients for pregnancy,"I am 5 months pregnant and just became educated on ingredients in the products I have been applying to my hair and skin. So often we don't think past the food we are ingesting when we worry about chemicals. This product contains at least 4 ingredients (PEG-8, Yellow 5, Propylparaben, methylparaben) that are known carcinogens, can effect your liver and kidneys and endocrine systems. Remember, if it can effect your body it can effect you baby. [...] I have been using a product called Belli Elasticity Belly Oil that has all natural ingredients. I got it on [...] and it may be spendy but I love the way it makes my skin feel. I will continue to use the Belli products even after my baby is born!"
1,Don't waste your money,I started using this the moment i found out i was pregnant. I used it 2x at least a day and it did nothing for me at all. Don't waste your money thinking this will prevent stretch marks!
1,Not if you already have stretch marks,I have been on this cream for 2 months and do not see any result. Might be good as prevention cream...
1,Christianity for the weak-minded,"The book answers the anti-Christians of the day; namely, atheists, Buddhists, Ayn Rand, Eric Hoffer, and so on -- i.e. 70's radicals. I ask anyone that if they find one 70's radical who is persuasive, then they are beyond any cure. Rand and Hoffer were egotistical, yes, but cogent, no. Buddhists are simply off-the-wall. Why would an apologist allocate prescious resources to answer a retard babbling on a street corner shows lack of prudence not Christian mission. Montgomery loves to list his innumerable degrees and honors on the back of his book. His book is almost a defense of John Warwick Montgomery's intellectual status rather than Jesus Christ. Why doesn't Montgomery address the Freemasonic origins of Joseph Smith, Charles Taze Russell, Mary Baker Eddy, Aliester Crowley and so on and the kabbalistic and Talmudic lifesource of anti-Christ institutions. He treats the symptoms but not the disease."
4,Crosley entertainment center,"I am satisfied with this stereo. I can now play my records, tapes, & cassettes. It doesn't take up too much room & sounds good. I have some old records that I can now play. I can play any size record, I also have some old 45 that I haven't been able to play for years & now can.I purchased my stereo from Amazon. All I did was fill out the form on my computer, give my credit card number & send it off. I rec'd my stereo in about 6 days. Very good service, right to my door."
1,Stopped working after 5 days,Turntable stopped operating after 5 days. Volume knob makes noise. Poor quality for a lot of money. Shame on the manufacturer. DONT BUY.
1,A Pretty Paperweight,"I ordered the Crosley Entertainment Center as a gift for my wife who had admired it at a local store. I could have got her a smaller, more modern-looking unit, but the retro style of these Crosleys drew us both in. The problem -- and a huge one -- was the the sound was unbearable. Instead of being just retro-styled in appearance, it was also retro in sound quality; it sounded like a poorly tuned in AM radio broadcast from 1935 ... but we were playing a good quality CD at the time! The other functions were just as bad, so it had to be the amp or speakers or wiring, but in any case, I just returned it. I suspect we got a lemon, and I won't write off all Crosley's (I really like the looks), but I won't order one on line either, I'll pay a bit more locally and ask to listen to it before leaving the store."
5,I love this Music System,"I purchased it because I wanted to play my old albums. It plays them very well, but I can also play cassettes and CD's.I love it. I also love the look of it.I recommend this music system and it was only $100."
2,"Good record player, bad CD and tape player","I had this player for several months and i have to admit it played records quite well for me. It was a great starter turntable. It didn't have a very high quality tape player but i was for the most part ok with that. What was a real problem was that one day i put a CD in the player and when i was finished listening to it, the player wouldn't eject. I fiddled with it for several hours but couldn't get it to work. Eventually i had to end up unscrewing the bottom and manually pushing out the CD tray. The same thing happened when i tried it again and i was very disappointed. I got rid of it after a while of it just sitting there. If you intend to use this item for CD and tape listening purposes i wouldn't recommend it (of course maybe that might just be my experience and won't happen to you, but i wouldn't take the chance). I don't find it worth the $100 it sells for here, i got mine for $75 at a local store and don't think it was worth even that."
1,sorry piece of junk,"Regretfully I own a Crosley Radio CR24-003A Music Writer. Just after the 90 day warranty expired, the cassette tape player quit playing. The first time that we tried the phonograph it did not work. Of course the 90 day warranty was expired! How I wish I had known how bad it was before considering telling my husband that I wanted it for my birthday. This is the first and last time a Crosley product will be purchased by us. Thankfully, the CD player does work."
2,"Looks fun, but poorly made.","I've wanted one of these for over a year, and my wife just gave me one for christmas. The cd player works well but that's about it.- The radio dial looks nice but is difficult to read, and difficult to dial into stations on either end of the spectrum.- The tape player has no buttons. No ff, rw, stop or pause. Push the tape in and it plays right away, and you have to eject it to stop. Lame.- The phonograph never worked. When I set it to ""phono,"" the needle sounded live but table wouldn't turn. And it was brand new. Super lame.So basically, the one I got was a great looking piece of crap. Better luck to you!"
1,Horrible Product =(,"I was so excited to get this as a Christmas gift had wanted one for sometime, but unfortunately we have yet to get one that works!!! The first record player the radio worked, but the CD player wouldn't barely open & turntable(piece of plastic) looked like it was about to fall right out. We returned it & purchased the same model at a different store & this one would not even turn on & looked even in worse shape. Also at both stores Kmart & Target every single box model looked like it had been opened already & taped up horribly. We could not find a box like looked like new I am not sure if they have to inspect them or everyone has had to return them!!"
1,PIECE OF JUNK!,"I bought this system, at LNT, as a Christmas gift for my husband. He has been wanting a record player for years! I thought that this unit would be an excellent choice because it had the extra features of the CD player, tape player, and MP3 hook up. The first system's CD player broke, so we returned it to LNT and took home a new unit. The second unit's CD player recently broke too! Two broken systems in less than a year! That is unacceptable! LNT has a great policy! We just took it in, told them it broke, and received store credit! We will never buy from Crosley again!"
2,Record player didn't work...,This would be a great product if the record player worked. The sound quality was very good for such an inexpensive unit but the record player was DOA. Read other reviews as this seems to be a common issue.
2,Disappointing,"I like the idea of this book - basic recipes for muffins with variations on each theme. I liked the helpful tips, and the recipes for toppings in the back of the book. But I have tried a fair number of recipes, and each was disappointing. The muffins lacked flavor and spice, and were heavy on the flour. None of the recipes were ""keepers"", according to my family. I'm puzzled by reviews stating a cookbook is ""an excellent treatment of the subject"", apparently without trying the recipes and tasting the results. You have to cook from a cookbook to know if it is any good! I'd recommend checking this one out of the library for a trial, if you have an interest in the book."
1,disappointed,"I considered buying this book after borrowing a copy from the public library. However, my decision has since changed after I tried two recipes from this book. I tried the coconut muffin and the chocolate chocolate chip muffin. The coconut muffin was dry, which I predicted after mixing in my dry ingredients and the chocolate chocolate chip muffin lacked flavour. I wouldn't waste my time and ingredients on another recipe to prove to myself that the book is worth buying."
5,Awsome book and great tips!!!,I have just started making muffin tops to sell and this book is chalk full of great recipes as well as tips and sources to purchase ingredients from. I was so glad i chose this book over others i looked at.
2,Not impressed,"I actually was going to return this book. I do not like cookbooks that do not include pictures, granted these are all muffins but still I like to compare mine to what they are suppose to look like. Plus, the pages are all faded and yellow so that along with no pictures made this book look very cheaply made. There are some good recipes in there, but nothing I cant find online for free."
4,Paris Encore (Zion Covenant),"I really like the style that the Thoene's use in their writing and I also enjoy reading historical fiction (especially Christian based ones). I was a little disappointed that most of the main characters from the first seven books are not really in this one, but it does lay down the first plank of the bridge between this series of books and their next series. Once again, I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading the next in this series (Dunkirk Crescendo (the last in this series)), to see how it will further build on the bridge to the next series."
2,Too many characters,"I am highly disappointed in how this series is playing out. We haven't heard about some of the main characters in a few books now, and instead they continue to introduce new characters. I would've preferred they follow the characters they spent the first four books building. Instead, we are left without knowing what happened to them. Kind of disappointing."
4,Good Book for Exam 700,I took the exam within one month from the day I bought this book and scored 87%. Read the book twice and took the sample test on IBM site.
4,700 Exam,"This book is a very useful study guide and the practice questions given at the end of the chapters are really good. It will also be useful to give practice tests which comes in a CD-ROM alongwith ""DB2 Cerfication for Dummies"" book. Make sure to give practice tests on IBM website too."
3,"Weird, But Interesting","Really not sure what to say about this book. Weird but interesting...Couldn't put it down, but not sure how much I really enjoyed it when I finished...Yet I remember the stories and they continue to intrigue.An interesting collection of short stories told in stream of consciousness style using vernacular language for realism. All effectively done.Some stories make you cringe, then a moment or two later, make you laugh. Like life, I suppose, so read the book.You will find it intriguing, a book of stories you will think about (and try to figure out) for some time."
5,"fun, shapes pull out to play with","Gave as gift to new parent and was well received. The foam shapes actually pull out of the book and the child can play with them, and put them back in like a puzzle. Excellent interactive book that stimulates the mind and hands."
3,Good clamps but plastic pads stain the work,I bought my clamps in December of 2005 and the oily plastic pad problem has not been fixed. The clamps are very nice otherwise. Just remember to protect your work from direct contact with the plastic pads.
1,Do not buy!,I have a pair of these clamps that I've owned for less than 6 months and used less than 5 times. This weekend I was using them and one broke while I was tightening it with one hand. I've owned Bessy's for years with no problems.
1,Bone head Amazon Shipping,"I ordered 4 of these clamps on August 20th.For Some reason in it's infinite wisdom someone at Amazon thought it best to ship them in groups of 3&1.They come shipped from the factory in pairs.I received one clamp and was told the others would be shipped later.Then I was told they were delivered. My wife and I were home on delivery day and NO ONE delivered to our address.The U.P.S. site indicated PORCH as delivery site.It is now October 3rd and I STILL don't have the matching three clamps.What makes this TOTALLY luducrous is that there are some people on different woodworking forums that have received duplicate orders and in some cases have not been billed for their merchandise.To paraphrase an old airline commercial...""Is this anyway to run an E-merchandising site?You bet it aint!""I have not used this clamp because if I don't get the other three the big A can pay to pick this one up and I'll never do buisness with them agin."
1,These clamps are cheap for a reason,"I do a lot of glue-ups with panels of substantial size. Cutting boards, tables tops and such. The clamping mechanism was engineered poorly and tends to break rather easily. Seems Jorgensen knows and will work with you if you've already made the mistake of purchasing them. They have been recalled.My supplier is taking mine back without question."
2,mighty dog food,As I sent an email prior to this one wanting my review on this I think if you look back it should speak for itself. I was happy with getting the item I ordered as quickly as I did but when I opened the box it was not what I asked for. The company did a good job with crediting my account but I wanted the gourmet flavor not what they sent. Because the one they sent I get in the stores the gourmet I found out was discontinued. My dog liked that flavor. If you could why not ask Mighty Dog why they discontinued it as well as another flavor beef and chicken. They were flavors my dog liked. Sandy.
2,"Cryptic, boring, and not a believable or enjoyale story to read","This book is overly literary, too didactically philosophical, inaccessible, and a terrible, terrible read. Do not buy this book, I had to for a class and I did not enjoy it at all (the beginning of the book was Ok, then it got worse and worse. I hate you Charles Johnson, you pretentious man)."
1,disappoiting,"Although an attractive and practical lamp, it was poorly made and the attachment for the gooseneck arm did not work. I worked with a very lovely woman from the lamp company who arranged for me to get a second lamp but that connector broke after about 2 weeks."
4,New Wave Comes Of Age!,"Hard to describe and even harder to catagorize, Count to Infinity has the pop of the bubblegum 80's radio play combined with the complexity of underground electroclash. It moves from fast dancable tunes to softer more experimental moments. Within the songs are statements about politics, social commentary and about the DJ culture as a whole.The only issue I have with this album is that the songs individually are very good but they don't seem to have a true theme together. Still worth the purchase if you are into disco-like New Wave and/or groups like the early 80's group Soft Cell."
5,Lo mejor de la musica latina,Es uno de los mejores disco junto con su cantante Andres Calamaro un Argentino con mucho talento al cantar ya que le pone todo el sentimiento en sus canciones
4,Easy Reading...Good Common Sense and Thought Provoking,"This book is a good reminder that we need to get back to the basics of life and begin to trust ourselves again. With the over whelming information we get from the media: TV, Newspapers, cell phones, work, etc. We need more than ever to sit down and listen to our inner voice that never gets a chance give us the most important information we need....the God within! Love this little book."
3,"Okay, But Falls Short","I agree with other reviewers that this book falls short on fulfilling its mission as a guide to awakening intuition. It provides general guidance but not specific guidance on how to connect with your intuition. It's still worth a read if you like to investigate and learn about psychic phenomenona, and it helps point one in the right direction to listen to their intuition.My biggest problem with this book was the author's use of nomenclature. It's a well written book with no grammatical errors, but when she decided on nomenclature to describe intuition she made it a bit confusing to the reader. Is intuition God or some undefined ""Universe"" or some other name that she uses randomly throuhgout the book to describe intuition? It seems as if she doesn't know what intuition is, and leaves the reader wondering as well."
4,Parrot in a Pepper Tree,"This is equally as good a read as Driving Over Lemons. If you fantasise about the romance of buying and developing a home in the wild, especially in Spain, this series of books is a must."
3,Not bad but not great,"Despite all the other reviews saying this CD is terrible, I beg to differ. It's not amazing but it's alright none the less. The ownly downpoint I would say is the occasional times where theres singing because it's just not the same without Jack's voice. But the guitar riffs are pretty sweet if you ask me.I would say get this CD but first I recomend getting on and on and then brushfire fairytales...if you still want more Jack Johnson stuff then I would get this, but not as a starter."
3,Good for a beginner or child,"This is a small, illustrated book that would be helpful for someone who wants to learn a few basics. For more information, I recommend Indian Sign Language by William Tomkins."
4,Relentless,Great read. The plot was a little slow in the beginning but once it got started I enjoyed it. Characters were very interesting. Great ending would like to read a sequel to this story.
3,"good stuff, not one of his best though","this is one of my least favorite GG albums but I will say that it has grown on me over time. Im more into his poppy stuff and the last album that he put out with the Murder Junkies (Brutality and Bloodshed for All)was by far some of his best stuff ever. Definately Check this out if you are really into GG. All of his stuff is great. Freaks, Faggots, Drunks and Junkies is also highly recommended"
3,OK,"I'm not a big bratz fan,but when I saw this doll at toysrus,I thought I should buy this.NO WAY!Instead I bought the bratz babyz african-american triplets.They're so cute.At least cuter than sharidan!"
4,BRATZ ARE THE BEST,"OK I MUST ADMIT THAT THE FOREVER DIAMONDZ IS A GREAT COLLECTION BUT THE LINE IN LYING TO EVERYONE. THEY SAY THERE IS A REAL DIAMOND NECKLACE FORE YOU, BUT THINK IF THEY GAVE U A REAL DIAMOND WOULDNT THE DOLL COST MORE THEN $30-$40 I MEAN REALLY. SO FOR EVERYONE WHO THINKS THE DIAMONDS ARE REAL DONT BECAUSE IF THEY WERE THE DOLL WOULD BE OVER $1000. THE DOLL IS GREAT AND ALL I LOVE HER OUTFIT BUT THE JEWELRY IS FAKE.P.S. I LOVE BRATZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Kinda like Jade.,"When I first saw her, I thought she was Jade..she looks too much like her, but her clothes are nice.& my sister has her so I know."
4,"Good pics, limited tile work possibilities","This book is full of excellent how-to pix. We wanted to see tile possibilities for renovating our bathroom. Nothing special in this book. Taunton Press is always an excellent publisher, though."
4,A surprise since it was not what I expected.,"This album was a surprised to me the first time I listen to it. I have been a great fan of DTS since I first heard Sex without Bodies. Which is the problem I had with this record at first. I expected one thing and ended up with something else. After a couples of listens, I grew to love this album. It has a great flow to it. Kelly voice have never souned better. It truned out what it alays intented to be and that was a very nice jazz album. If you looking for Sex without Bodies, this is not the album for you. If you looking for a honest nightclub type jazz band, this will be right up your alley."
3,I hate to be the wet blanket ...,"... but I don't like Nature as much as most of these reviewers. It sounds good, and it is worth buying, but compared to the group's previous releases, I don't hear nearly as much verbal wit, or as much range of expressive emotion.The messages of most of the lyrics on this disc are unclear and self-contradictory.I had prepared a much longer review, but I discarded it when it occurred to me that the problem may be that Dave Cantor is losing some of his Seinfeldian whimsy and trying to be more philosophical. Maybe this is a transitional period to a new, more mature Dave's True Story. My feeling is that, with depth of meaning, as with many other things, less is more."
1,My Review Was Deleted by Amazon. Why?,"I had a review posted by amazon. It received a response by the producer of the album. It has been deleted. I'd like to know why.The album will not play on my computer's CD. Nor will it play on two other machines. Why not? Because it has some kind of bizarre copy protection? I don't know.That's a minus two stars in my book.The other two stars are lost for content. I love Unauthorized, one of my favorite. I think Sex Without Bodies is pretty good too. But this one is commercial pap. If you like Krall et al. you'll probably love this, but it's definitely 2nd rate.That's the other minus two."
5,Superbly jazzy mood,"Once in a while you stumble upon a rough gem. This cd is such a gem. It contains deliciously jazzy songs. Some with a positive beat, such as the fantastic 'dog's life' and 'everlasting no', some with a slightly gloomy touch, such as 'small black heart'.It's unpolished sound is completely in line with the music, and adds to the atmosphere.Kelly Flints voice is a delight, and fits with the change in moods. It reminded me of a Dutch singer-songwriter, Fay Lovsky.The only disappointment is the opening song, which is quite monotonous and, actually, boring.Still, I can easily forgive them for that, considering the enjoyment of the other songs.If you like this style, I strongly recommend trying Working Nights from Working Week, the absolute number one jazzy-pop albums ever produced."
2,Cheap Tacky Look,The picture of this product is misleading. The product delivered was cheap and gaudy looking.
2,useless,"Its useless because the part that goes around the neck and chest is too big, even with straps adjusted to smallest. Length is perfect so I know its the right size. Maybe if you have a bully breed it might fit. Prob is that it slips down and off. Material is softer and nicer but still useless."
5,Looks more like white gold,I am very pleased with this ring. The polish is so extreme it looks more like white gold. The stone is a very nice color.
5,Best of the best,"I've been a fan of Kristin's since the late 80's about House Tornado time. She and the muses (and the spinoff Belly) have always been on my list of top few bands. But this album, quite unexpectedly rose straight to the top. Great lyrics and such a strange, edgy, uncomfortable mood and rhythms. I think it's cause she's playing the instruments too, there is something realized in this album that just isn't in her other work. Very nice."
4,A little bit off centre,"I keep this album in a subgroup that includesHanne Hukkelberg - Little ThingsBjork - DebutLaura Veirs - Carbon GlacierMary Margaret O Hara - Miss AmericaKatell Keineg - JetAnjani - Blue alertKate Bush - The Hounds of LoveMartha Wainwright - Martha WainwrightPatti Smith - HorsesSinead O Connor - The lion and the CobraDelores O Riordan (The Cranberries) - Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?etc.Modern female vocalists. I can highly recommend all of the above."
3,I disagree . . .,"This album feels like Hersh has come to a standstill, musically and lyrically. The songs start off strongly, but quickly become indistinguishable variations. The passion evident in her other albums is gone in this one, leaving a dull despair unleavened by the hard-won hope in previous works. She occasionally breaks through what has become her standard solo-album ""little girl"" nonthreatening voice with a roar of rage, and you feel how much more this album could be."
2,Disappointed,"Been a fan of KH since the first eponymous Throwing Muses LP on 4AD which a friend sent me from Wales long before it was available in the U.S., and I truly do think she is among the very greats; but this album, with its spare, choppy arrangements and ultra-self-conscious lyrics, has left me completely cold. It's way, way, way below par. I knew something was amiss when the only track that grabbed me on the first listen turned out, on closer inspection, to be a Cat Stevens cover.True-blue believers will need to have it, but anyone unfamiliar with KH's genius should start somewhere--anywhere at all--else. As for me, my fervent prayer for the next album is that she'll stop puttering along like some myopic granny in the slow lane, and howl, howl, howl like she used to howl in the good ol' out-of-control days."
3,"Great Book, description/picture/publisher not accurate",I purchased this book for my son for Christmas. He was thrilled. I was disappointed that the book I received was not like what was pictured in the ad. The Publisher (Franklin) was not accurate and the publishing date was not 1978 but rather 1980. I checked online to compare what I did receive and the pricing was still accurate. That is the only reason why I kept it.
2,Volume not loud enough,"I loved everything about this unit. It was super-easy to use. Quickly responsive. Provided street names. Had all the features one could want. But we regretfully had to return it after one short trip. We soon discovered that when traveling at a faster speed on the open road, the volume, even at maximum, could not be heard over the normal road noise in a Honda Accord. If you're alone in your vehicle, no music and just in-town traveling, it would be ideal."
2,good unit --while it lasts,"Let me start off by saying I like this GPS. It has all the feature I like and I really can not complain about it while it was working . However, I would have to say buyer be warned. I had mine for a year and just short of the warrantee it died. One day it worked the next it would not go passed the splash screen. I would say it was my bad luck but in researching it online I found quite a few others had the same problem, some shortly after they purchased it. Nextar has a lifetime exchange program but the price is about $140 which is more then I paid new. They originally told me they would fix it but the supervisor turned it down because I lack a good reason. Standing by there product is not a good enough reason. it is also my understanding that even under warrantee Nexter requires you to pay for return shipping on your repair both way. I caution you to research this unit before considering a purchase"
4,Great GPS for the money,"This Nextar GPS is great. For less than $100 you get 3.5 inch screen, text to speech, mp3 player and photo viewer. Unit is a little slow acquiring GPS signal when first powered up and battery life coulld be longer. However it comes with a car power plug and an ac power plug and will charge via USB. I see a lot of people complaiining about the volume and not being able to hear it. I do not have that problem mine is extremely loud and I have to keep it turned off the maximum because it is blowing me away. I drive an old Toyota 4runner that is 4 wheel drive so I have plenty of road noise. Anyway I would highly recommend and put it up against anything Garmin and Magellan make in the $150-$200 range."
1,Might as well use a Map.,"I understand this is an older model, but if you are thinking of getting it to save money DO NOT!!!!! I have the 2008 X3, first day the dash mount broke. Also it would say ""waiting for GPS signal"" for 20 minutes. Once I was in an unfamiliar place when it took very long to find the signal, I drove around waiting for it to find one and ended up in a bad part of the city. I stuck it out until I could save for a higher-rated brand GPS because while planning a trip the night before this GPS froze and would not load past the power screen. Reset button wouldn't change this. Luckily my friend had a reliable GPS I could borrow. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Seriously save for a Brand Name product that is worth it- do your research!"
1,Conks out when you need it most.,"Our unit started out a little unreliable and has totally conked out after just a few uses. It started out occaisionally shutting itself off even with charger plugged in. On our last trip it died completely. Nextar's return policy says see your store, the store says see Nextar."
2,"Nice Easy to Use GPS, but lasted only 2 years","Nice compact GPS, but touchscreen does not work when temp is above 75 degree and its only two years old.When it worked, it was a really nice GPS, showing distance and time to designation and current time. Map direction was very easy to understand and unit is very easy to operate. Volume is a little on the low side. Battery lasted only 15. minites when it was new. I would like to have this unit repaired, but NEXTAR only offer exchange program for $79.99, same cost as a new unit."
1,Consider this a disposable GPS,"Product worked splendidly for the first 12 months. Almost to the day, one year later...it would not allow you to get to the ""address screen"" to enter your destination. Called customer service, they said since the warranty had expired, basically, I was out of luck. I said I understood that they were no longer required to repair my unit for free...I was interested in what the cost would be to repair it. NO SUCH OPTION: they said after the warranty expires, Nextar does not accept units for repairs. If I wanted to try to get it fixed, try local computer repair shops in my area.Never before had I EVER encountered a company which absolutely REFUSED to stand behind their product. Like I said...DISPOSABLE GPS.Nextar = NEVER AGAIN!!"
3,A Super Slam is an awesome accomplishment!,"To be honest, I wasn't very thrilled reading this book. The adventures he writes about are awesome, but pretty much the same as in his autobiography ""Life at Full Draw."" I'm not sure why I was disappointed; it may be because much of what was written in ""Life at Full Draw"", was also included in Super Slam. I highly recommend ""Life at Full Draw,"" because it tells a lot more about the life of Chuck from boyhood through his Super Slam!"
2,Cute but not worth it,"This toy is so cute in the store but once you get it home and pull out that little paper in the back (the one that is for testing) it is not loud at all... in fact, you can barely hear it!! Not worth the money in my opinion."
1,Lousy spotlight,"Stay away from this useless thing:- Battery lasts no more that 10 minutes at full blast.- Takes some 4-5 hours to charge.- Loses all charge after a couple of months of being left alone.Only good thing is the moderately strong beam of light it shines... while it lasts.Actually, have had extremely bad experiences with B&D; products lately."
1,"Bright, but only for the first 10-15 minutes","I fully charged the battery on mine, and then took it out to the pond for some frog gigging. After about 10-15 minutes, the light's intensity began to diminish significantly and quickly. It was practically useless in less than 25 minutes' burn time. I could not, with a clear conscience, recommend this product to anyone."
1,Waste of money,"I purchased the Black and Decker VEC156BD light about a year ago to have for emergencies when the commercial power went out. Twice that happened and I got no more then 4-5 minutes use, even on the low setting. Recently the battery stopped taking a charge. Replacement batteries cost half the price of the original purchase price, about $16. Not wanting to throw good money after bad, I tossed out the whole light. What a waste! Shame on Black and Decker. They have acquired more companies than they can manage effectively (Stanley, DeWalt, Porter-Cable, Delta, DeVilbiss, EMGLO, Kwikset, Weiser, Price Pfister, et al)."
1,Battery Doesn't Hold Charge,"I was initially thrilled and could not believe the amount of light this put out. I only got one good use out of the spotlight. After that, it would start to dim immediately and soon after that it wouldn't light even after hours of charging. Maybe this would work for daily use and recharging, but I bought it for emergencies and to check my property when my dog barks at night. It was a waste of money. I was surprised because I felt confident with the Black and Decker name when purchasing."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Don't waste your money on this thing. Battery only lasts a few minutes on a full charge and it stopped working completely after about 1 years time and only being used appox 6 times.
2,Battery Size and Type Limited.,"Not enough energy can be stored in this size and type of battery to last very long using its High Beam. It gives a donut shaped beam, dark in the center, of light and not a really tight beam. Battery charging performance seems to fall off fairly soon. It's a lower cost item that may be useful for some 'light' duty use."
1,No AC Charging cable,"Be aware there is no AC charging cable that comes with it, so you'll have to find a cheap extension cord that will work with it. I got one of these for Christmas and I don't have a way to charge it yet.I have the model VEC156BD which is the same as the one listed here, but it doesn't have dimming which this one states. Not sure why 2 different featured models would have the same model number."
1,terrible,"After very limited use, none of it in the field, this light stopped charging. No attempts to make it charge again have worked, and the internal batteries are not user-replaceable."
1,Super bright... for about 15 minutes,"It takes 12 hours to charge, then it's unbelievably bright.... for about 20 minutes. After 30 minutes of continuous use it's completely dead, the battery is 100% drained and the bulb emits only a barely visible orange glow.They really should state on the package that this light is only good for about 15 minutes of use, then requires a full 12 hour recharge.This would be useful if the power went out and you need a flashlight to find your other, better, longer lasting flashlights. Or you could just keep one of those by your bed instead.Do not buy IMO."
4,an excellent listen,"The flow and mood changes of these two disks are excellent. Of course this is a focused look at Carlos's more spiritually minded works, which I have always loved, and as such it hits the mark dead center. It is impossible to listen to this album and not feel better for it. Thanks for another great listen, my friend."
5,Another Great CD!,"This is another great release from Santana, that I can't miss out. Even though I have some of his songs on previous albums, I don't mind hearing them again, and again. The quality of his music is rear in these days, therefore I treasure each new release of one of the best guitar artists in the world! To have one CD vocal and second instrumental, phenomenal idea.I highly recommend this CD to all the teenagers to listen and find out what is the real music is all about."
4,Carlos Santana's masterpiece!,"Carlos Santana is proving on this album that how diverse he can be on this two disc set. The first disc is full of new material and standards, while the second disc are instrumental tracks. Carlos Santana proves he is that talented on ""The Multi-Dimensional Warrior."""
2,doesn't deliver,"I have just about every Santana album, cassette and CD that has been released by Santana. I am very disappointed in this CD. They should have just called it a ""Best Of"" instrumentals. There is nothing new here, if you own any of Santana's previous music releases you will have these songs already in your collection.Carlos is one of my favorite all-time guitarists along with Jimi, Eric and Duane and Dickey and Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck. I was expecting new material instead of a rerelease.If you are new to Santana's music, then you will be happy with this CD, but if you are a veteran of his music, you may be let down....sorry Carlos."
2,Warrior is ultimately tiresom,I have to agree with the first writer.This is a bland collection of songs that you'll forget.I bring out the older albums to forget this dismal effort.I am a huge Santana fan but this album was putting me to sleep.Two discs Two times the torture.Better things are coming folks but not here.
1,TERRIBLE,I was purchasing this item thinking it would be way more adult content. I received and watched it all it was was girls getting nude and rubbing their bodies. I was SO INCREDIBLY disappointed. If you're looking for XXX type stuff don't bother with this garbage.
3,Stain the wood,"The rubber on these clamps is very soft. When clamping it leaves a stain on the wood that will not come off without a lot of sanding/scraping/planing. They work fine and are pretty heavy duty but the marks that are left remain after finishing if only a clear coat or light stain is used. I have a lot of these clamps (and the 12"" and 36"") I bought for a large project. The price was fine but now I am looking for other pads to change out with these. If you find the price is great then buy them and get new pads."
4,Still Working After 10 Years,"I bought 8 of these clamps for my first carpentry project 10 years ago. I built a few cabinets and wall hung book shelves with them. In the past 7 years, I built a bed, a work bench, numerous small projects and these clamps are still working great. One word of advice is these clamps do bent with they are over tightened. They do not need to be tighten so much to hold the pieces in place. Once should always use a scrap piece of wood to separate the clamp orange rubber and the finish wood. This increase the bearing area and protect the finish wood. I was a novice and found that while the orange rubber does not leave any marks on the finish wood, the contact areas stain differently. In general, these are great clamps!"
2,These clamps leave oily stains on your work.,"A word of caution about these clamps. The pads on the jaws of these clamps is made of an oily plastic that makes oily marks on the wood.Cleaning the pads with solvent doesn't help and getting the oil off the wood is difficult/impossible.I've contacted the manufacturer and they are aware of the problem. They recommend going over the oily marks with solvent two or three times. Then, they recommend that you apply wood stain to the project.To read more Amazon reviews about this problem, check the 12 inch version of this same clamp.Even with the problem I've just described, I have to say that these are strong, well-made, quality clamps....if you remove the plastic pads."
4,Very Good Clamps,"Good clamps. Not Bessey, next best thing and cheaper. 4 stars only cause their wooden handles look like they were made in Iraq."
3,Wrong product,"Damn. Obviously good quality, but doesn't come close to fitting the air intake in my car, even if I've chosen the car from the list. Apparently, the filters in US- and European-models aren't the same. There should be some kind of information about this..."
1,cheap for a reason,Not long after I bought this cable it still retratcs just fine. Unfortunately it won't stay extended at all. That makes it almost useless. I guess it's a cheap cable for a reason.
1,Recoil Lock Broke,"I purchased 3 of these for our company and 1 already broke. THe re-coil Lock broke, where it wont stay in the extended locked position. It just keeps wanting to wind up. I expected APC to have better quality."
1,cheap and awful,Worked ok for a little while - now it will not stay extended. I have noticed there are other reviews stating this - I should have paid closer attention to them.
4,Pretty good,"Works as promised, although I have to admit I was disappointed it wasn't longer. I haven't measured the whole length, but seems more like 4 feet. No problem with the retracting action so far, so overall I am pretty happy, especially for the price.Also, you WILL find co-workers or friends who will be jealous of this, they think it is impossible to have ""twisted-pair"" retractable/flat cables. Just for the room alone it saves in laptop bag, it is worth it."
2,Another book by this author,Hougland. Another books by the author that wrote JSP for Dummies. This guy rehashes what he learned reading from others. He has no new ideas and just wants to turn out books. Don't buy this book....
2,Author and publisher should be ashamed - Poorly written!,Apparently some people buy into this kind of work. But I found it to be poorly written and filled with inaccuracies. It appears that no technical reviewers reviewed this book before it was published. A very sloppy book - like a first draft of a book that was never completed.I was especially disappointed to see the name Prentice Hall on this book. This publisher should be ashamed.
1,Bunk,"Hougland churns out books for the sake of churning out books. This one is a worthless rehash of a questionable technology. Save your money on something else. The writing quality is extremely poor, cursory, and appears to be rushed - probably to get this to market before the WAP standard is obliterated anyway."
1,Worthless,"The only reason this book was written was simply to get published. It is a poor example of a technical manual. Hougland is a pretender who writes like he knows what he is talking about, but is only good at ripping off other people's work.Save your money for toilet paper or Huggies."
2,Avanti - beginning Italian,"This book is not helpful to some one who desires to learn Italian on their own. The format of this book makes understanding the language difficult. Many concepts are left unexplained or poorly explained. I can not comment concerning its utility in a class room setting, but it fails miserably at self-instruction. I learned German through self-instruction so that when I visited Austria, I spoke only German. I had no difficulty with the language. Therefore I can comment from personal experience. I do not recommend this book for self-instruction. It should not be offered to the general reader without indicating that it is appropriate for class room instruction only."
1,Not very instructive or useful,"I was required to use this book for a community college Italian course that I took to improve my limited Italian. Now it has been quite some time since I was at university, but I was appalled by this book. First, it was expensive; but most significantly it appears to be written for use in middle school, certainly not college. If this represents ""new thinking"" in teaching language, that is, teaching adults as though they were children who need silly pictures and juvenile activities to keep their attention, our education system is in deep trouble."
1,Poorly written and edited,"This book contains many mistakes, and can be used only in a class with a good instructor who truly masters the language. Written by non-native speakers."
4,"Good book, but poorly edited...","If you're looking for a little book that has a lot of info, then this is a good one to get. Very self explanatory in the title, the book has lots of basic/fundamental theorems, facts and formulae, ranging from algebra, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, computers and more.The only issue that I have with the book is the editing. I have found several double words (and and), and I have not even finished reading it all yet! Aside from that, it's a good book to look things up, and to learn from."
1,The Perfect Love is Far from Perfect,"I recently attempted to read The Perfect Love by Ruth Myers. I say attempted, because, despite my best efforts, I couldn't get through the entire book. It was slow, dull, and repetitive. It was simply a regurgitation of sermons I've heard from the time I was a child and Bible verses that I am more than familiar with. The portions where Ruth described how God's perfect love was demonstrated in her life were interesting, but she stopped short of revealing anything too personal and the stories lacked details that would have hooked me. My advice, go straight to the source (the Bible) to find out just how perfect God's love is for all of us!I received this complimentary book from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group as part of their Blogging for Books program."
3,"His Love is Perfect. This book, not so much...","The title of Ruth Myers' book is beautiful:""The Perfect Love: Intensely Personal, Overflowing, Never Ending...""There is, in fact, quite a lot of beautiful, lyrical language in the book. I have been moved over and over by her selection of quotations, Psalms, old hymns, and other lovely writings.I wanted to like it, I really did. Every time I put it down and read another book before even contemplating picking it up again, I forced myself to go back to it. And though I continued to find lovely old hymns and quotes, I still never really got ""into it.""It wasn't compelling, or even particularly interesting, as far as the presentation of the material went. It just seemed to meander along, stringing together things that talk about the love of God.Honestly? No, I never did finish it. I slogged through about 3/4 then gave it up as a lost cause.So, 5 stars as a source of inspirational quotations, 1 star as a meaningful Bible Study or life-changing work."
4,Great Hebrew Poems,"I have used this book of Modernish Hebrew poems and there are some truly wonderful poems. The commentaries are also not only useful but insightful. I have used it in a teaching environment as well.If it is reprinted I would recommend that the poems be given not only with transliteration in a side-by-side way, but also the translation. Maybe the book needs to be wide rather than long so this can be done in three columns. The commentary can then follow."
2,"I am a Christian, are you?","Because many people here seem to have this other faith called Calvinism.I find it very interesting. Piper and company as well as many others have criticized open theism by expressing thoughts that open theists simply do not have. Despite this, they exclaim how their arguments tear down any open theist arguments. How can that be if you are not talking about the same thing.For the record:Open theists believe and affirm:1) That God is divinely perfect, including omnipotence and omniscience (all knowing).2) That God is the sovereign creator and lord3) That God is all powerfuland many other beliefs that we all know to be true as stated by the Bible.If your arguments against open theism are any of these, then you are wasting your time. That is unless your goal is to misrepresent other people.""Not a very Christian tactic to use, in my humble opinion"". I am editing this out because this is not a very Christian thing for me to say myself.John Lancaster, I forgive you!"
2,Can't return it!,"I have no doubt that this is a wonderful video for kids because my own like it so much that I could never return it. But the sound quality is so poor that I cannot be in the same room with it! If you ever bought a video from a street peddler with sound quality this bad, you'd demand your money back. The volume jumps, there's hissing and popping and the voices sound like they're yelling up a well....I'm thinking they may have knocked this one out too quickly."
4,Fun for Christmas,"This is a fun little album that I have listened to every Christmas since I can remember. At first listening, it might sound a little....different. But if you love the time period of when this album was made, then you'll probably love the album. Some songs are classic, in the classic style, while others are silly and fun. I think it's something that kids will love, and parents will enjoy as well."
5,You Can Listen All Season Long...,"After 25 years of owning the cassette, the only one I care to hear. Now that the kids are grown, means even more."
5,favorite Christmas music,"This is the third set of these discs I've bought over the last 30 years- I wear them out,if that's possible and this time I'm gonna copy them. This is the best and most popular of all the Readers Digest sets and this particular one was delivered quickly and in very good condition. I will enjoy it all season long- Gerry"
4,I Would Expect Better,"I would expect better than I received, but then I am a technophile that enjoys getting as close to the experience as possible when I cannot be present physicallly. I received this DVD with great anticipation, and I cannot fault the music, the production, the staging, et al. I DO take exception to a product that can give me 5.1 surround sound, and then foist it onto a paltry 4:3 aspect ratio screen size. If the technology existed for the 5.1 sound, it should have been available for the 16:9 screen.The purists will fault me for raising a seemingly insignificant detail in an otherwise stellar product, but then, a purist would opt for a live performance over a recorded one. I would wish for the best of both worlds, which are readily available, but are slow in coming."
1,hmmmm,"Edited to say: I'm changing my mind - I watched it again, and liked it a little better. To be fair, I have to be grateful this dvd exists, it documents an important performance, and this Harry Kupfer staging seems to be an important moment in the development of the whole ""Regietheater"" thing.It is an interesting premise to make the whole story the fantasy of a sick mind, however, as Peter Konwitchny points out, in an interview about his own different (also Regietheater) staging of the opera for Munich -- to put the whole story in the mind of Senta -- belittles the real human tragedy - the struggle to love and trust, the failure to trust....So, I am glad this video exists, and glad I watched it, but in final analysis, well, I was not in love with the staging, no, and not really in love with the singers -- they did fine jobs, but and am eager to get my hands on the video with Flying Dutchman from the Vienna Staatsoper with Nina Stemme and Falk Struckman to make up for it."
4,Matti Salminen steals the show,"This performance should be titled: ""The Story of the Sea Captain Who Sells his Daughter."""
4,super magnet.. hooks are a little disappointing.,"First off, this thing is sturdy and pretty darn heavy which one would expect with the strength of the magnets. I do wish that it had an option to hang it on my fridge with super-magnets because I have little to no wall space to hang it. I am going to purchase some giant magnets and then attach to the back so I can do that.The hooks have little 'knobs' in the top that simply slide into slots on the inside-bottom of the holder, If the holder is not firmly against a wall or similar the hooks would easily slide off."
4,Super Convenient!,This is a good product. The additional hooks under the holder are a plus for other kitchen utensils. Installation was quick and easy. I used my own anchors for dry wall. I found the product to be a bit heavy and the anchors provided were not the best quality.
5,Love this product!,"I am very happy with the product and the seller. Item shipped quickly and was just as described. The magnet is strong and holds all my knives, including the cleaver, perfectly. Couldn't be happier!"
5,A Great Knife Saver,This is a great wall mount for storing your knives and other hanging tools. I always hated keeping my knives in the drawer for fear it would mess them up. Now I have a safe place to keep them. Highly recommend and easy to mount.
5,Knife Holder,This is such a great idea. It keeps my knives handy and in easy view. I just reach up and pick the one I want. And I don't have to pull knives out of the knife block wondering which one it is!!
3,Rapid Treatment with Too Little Substance,"This brief volume is a reasonable introduction to the Shawnee indian nation by a Kentucky anthropologist. It gives a broad portrait of life for the Shawnee and their intertribal and pioneer relations. The book is clearly written with admiration for the life and ways of the Shawnee, but it is extremely light on first hand research, coverage of intimate Shawnee life details and on matters such as language and cultural identity. It seems targeted perhaps at the curious teenager who seeks a simple book report for high school local history. I wish it could have been more comprehensively researched, and more scholarly in its fine points and notes while maintaining its accessibility and general readibility."
3,Pay for 8 and get 4! What???,"Yes, it's billed as an 8 pc kit but there are four of them that are actually quite scary to use. There are no directions with the kit and it's only after some checking about that I surmise that the tamer of the set are the tapered plug cutters. The wild looking cutters appearing on the hinge side of the box are the ones at suspect. I was relieved to read a brave reviewer elsewhere who said that the biggest of these is the scariest and requires a solid clamping effort. I can attest to the fact that all of the back row require the same. There, I've said it. And I don't feel any older, less good looking or less of a man for having done so. ;-)"
2,plug cutter,The 4 piece plug cutter set consisted of 8 cutters for 4 sizes. Haven't figured out why I need 2 cutters for each size.
5,Insightful Look Into the Lives of New Music Divas,"If you're a fan of Alicia Keys, Ashanti, Beyonce, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez, or Mya, then you will find this a must have for your book collection. The author provides a chronological account of each of their careers as well as provide photos of the artists.If you're studying women in music, this book will give you an insight to some of the more popular Pop and R & B singers of this time.--Shelia M Goss, BellaOnline Women in Music Editor"
5,The First & Only of Its Kind!,"I can't say enough about this book. I heard it was good but it wasn't until I read it and I witnessed the hard work that's been put into it that I can see that this book is truly one of its kind.This is not only an interesting and fun read but one heck of a reference book for anyone interested in these ladies' lives in and out of the music business. I thought I knew everything about a few of these women but I got some surprises. "" Divas of the New Millennium "" is an intelligent read filled with fun and more facts than you can imagine. You may think you know everything about these stars but the authors will prove you wrong. This was an amazing read. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read whether they like music books or not. I look forward to more work from Stacy, Natasha and Kelly."
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed - this came apart the second time I used it - only on light-weight craft papers, etc. - and would not go back together firmly enough to use - so it was thrown away."
1,Nonsense,"I know my history and this book is pure nonsense,fabrication and a revision of history to support ahidden agenda. Ukrainians also were in large numbers, inhabitants of the very same concentration camps as others. Put simply this book is pure racist and not worth the paper it is written on."
1,Soviet Dezinformatsia,"Here is a most distinct sloppy and truly un reserched work on the issue of collaboration in Central and Eastern Europe. The author's reliance on KGB provided docuentation make one wonder what the purposes realy was in writting this ""work"".Purpose of the work seems to have been the inflamation of unfounded animosity of Ukrainians and Jews. A comparative study on the collaboration of other nations with the Nazi's vis-a-vis Jews would reveal that French and Polish and Czech collaboration lead to a much more significant toll on the Jewish population in those occupied territories than in Nazi occupied Ukraine."
1,Rubbish,"Another example of anti-Ukrainian propaganda, once very popular in pro-Soviet circles and amongst their adherents in the West. The Soviets are now gone, hurrah, but their fellow travellers are, alas, still with us. Serious scholarship demonstrates that Ukraine lost more of its people than any other nation in Nazi occupied Europe (to say nothing about losses a decade earlier, during the genocidal Great Famine of 1932-33). Among the millions enslaved or mudered by the Nazis were many Ukrainian nationalists of the OUN and UPA, more than a few of whom were destroyed in the infamous concentration camps, like Auschwitz. Indeed the two brothers of Stepan Bandera, the OUN leader, both died there. The Ukrainian nationalists were not pro-Nazi, although there are obviously still those who would like the world to think that."
5,Knuckles,I have been using this product for two years. Everyone that first experiences this unique and inexpensive device is startled. Amazing sensations of stress relief. I work at a busy call center where people take calls from hundreds of angry people. This product has aided many in stress relief. I highly recommend it to everyone. Its money well spent. Particularly in the privacy your home - great tool for ice breaker during intimate affairs.
4,Like 'em a lot.,"I bought these at a kiosk at the Mall of America a few years back. I think they're great and can be used with light or medium pressure. These aren't for deep pressure massage because they aren't strong enough. This is what you use at home, not the type of accessory you'll find when you get a massage from a professional.Here's how you use them: put them in the palms of your hands and use your weight (not your hands) to create the pressure. Do not put your fingers in the holes. The holes aren't for your fingers. They are just the shape of the knobs for massage. You'll find they are much more comfortable to use if held correctly and you won't have any fatigue.Obviously they feel great when used on the back and shoulders but they are also great for use on the legs, especially after sports to release tension in the quads and calves."
2,Flimsy,"My husband and I purchased these for back massage. We followed the use instructions, but the plastic in the center cracked/tore the first and only time we tried them, and I don't think we were using excessive pressure. I haven't read of anyone else having this problem, so it could be we weren't using them correctly, but these were not as sturdy as I thought they would be. Felt pretty good for a few minutes anyway."
2,Price doubled in past week,"I was going to buy this product, but in the week or so it was in my shopping cart, the price doubled, including going up by three dollars since this morning. That's lame."
1,not what i expected,"wanted the battery operated, returned product and will buy what we need. cheap plastic and wide for fingers to use."
1,wicked stupid,"the description made it seems like to would be flexible which it is not, it only fits in a very large and and it dfoens't feel all that great on the person receiving the massage"
2,Too flimsy for a vigorous massage,"These tools are fine for a gentle backrub, but when I used more pressure they bent and looked like they might break. Once the top section indented completely, though I was able to pop it back. After buying these, I decided to tryThe Original Palmassager by the Pressure Positive Company, Sapphire Blueinstead, and have found them very sturdy. But I think the Nukkles are more comfortable for the person giving the massage."
5,Score!!,"Such a simple little object and such great relief! My doctor recommended I give this tool a try for the muscle spasms I am having in my shoulder. She hit the nail on the head with this one. Inexpensive, simple, easy to use, and no medications required. My hat is off to the person who came up with this. If you are experiencing aches and pains, you will not regret the purchase of Nukkles."
5,Amazing massage tool,I love these! They feel great and are awesome at getting knots out. And they make great gifts for a reasonable price.
4,great addition to my doula bag!,Just added this to my doula bag. I use it mostly for upper body shoulder and back massage. Super easy to clean and its compact :)
4,Stan Lee is THE BEST,"This flick was surprisingly good. It was expecting ""very good"" and then got ""great"". Not only did I like it, but my daughter loved it. I hope that Stan comes out with more ""Mosaic"". It is a great concept and a great story."
3,Engaging a new super hero audience,"I can see from this animated movie Stan Lee is ensuring a new breed of super hero audience is being engaged to keep this form of entertainment alive and kicking. Not written as an adult-gauged story, but more for current youth to experience the genre of animated entertainment targetting the topic of a normal person becoming empowered with abilities beyond the norm. Scott Lobdell, known for writing about character development in his comic stories during the Uncanny X-Men days, definitely was true to form in putting much focus on the main character changing from a young actress to a hero. Young family members 15 and under will probably appreciate this more, as this is not written to present Stan Lee's old work or something even close to this as times have changed - so has Stan's storytelling to adjust with the times."
1,At least Anna Paquin's Publicist Likes It.....,"..judging by the 5 star reviews for this mess. Stan Lee has managed to churn out something worse than ""Captain America"" or the Fantastic Four TV show.Utilizing the ""little blonde girl saves the world"" template, Mr. Lee created a new super hero with chameleon-esque powers (don't ask me how, it is never clearly explained) who battles a race of human/chameleons who want to ""take over the world"". YAWN...Of course, the little blonde girl is perky and cracks tiresome jokes even when the bad guys are pummeling her. And of course, she has ""Daddy issues"" - her father is an Interpol agent who is tracking down the bad chameleon-people too. ""They hurt my Daddy, I'll show them (and Daddy)"" - So instead of therapy, the main character chooses super-heroing. Barf, Gag, Ugh!!To make matters worse, the animation is boring, completely uninspired. Stan Lee really needs to stop making these things.And I thought ""Dazzler"" was the worst female super-hero ever..."
2,Horrible,"This in no way shape or form visually compares to the Marvel movies like Dr. Strange, Iron Man, Incredible Hulk Vs etc. The voices were horrible and the story line was sub par. No wonder I saw this on sale for $5. The only reason I gacve it two stars was because I know the effort it takes to do an animation."
3,Just okay ...,I expected more from this film. The ending was disjointed and abrupt. Even my kids were disappointed...
1,I thought they already had a female spider-man rip-off,"Wow, I tried to watch this because Stan was involoved but it felt completely uninspired. I watched it on Cartoon Network And still found myself unable to get interested even though it was ""free"" to watch, my recommendation is rent it before buying it. Honestly though, I think most will agree the animation is horrible and the story is completely uninspired."
2,Yawn,Oh wow...a superhero Barbie...not even a good story. Strike one! A new never heard of race of men? Strike two! A love story of sorts with a lizard of sorts! Strike three you're out of there...more thought went into the box design then the story!
4,Not bad,"I purchased this ring as a ""try me"" set. I recently discovered that I cant ware gold and thought I would try silver. I chose this ring because the size of the center stone is a realistic size. It should be easier to find CZ under 1 carat. It is very pretty but I dont think it would pass for a real diamond. It works for its intended use quite nicely. I like the way it looks on my finger and it is much better than I expected for the price. I will keep this ring even when I get the real set. Maybe I will ware it on my right hand."
2,"Looks Nice, but Doesn't Last!","I bought this ring in November and in February the stone fell out. I contacted the seller and ask if this was the norm for their products or if I perhaps I received a ""dud""; sometimes it happens. I would have liked a replacement right but instead I was told the below.""Most of the jewelries that are in this price range are most likely to last for a few months or a year or two and they are called fashion jewelry.That's why they are not expensive.Right now we offer free shipping if you want to purchase another one.We are really sorry for this.""I have a lot of different jewelry and this has never happened to me. Looks nice but doesn't last."
3,Ehhh...,"Not what I was expecting at all! The center stone sits in a ring all of it's own, that sets down into the ""rings"" that surround the center stone. The ""rings"" that surround the center stone aren't even rings, they are one piece. It's very cheap looking. The center stone/ring on it's own isn't bad, however the band part does chip/scratch easily. I gave it a 3 because the stone isn't all that bad looking, but the ring itself isn't what I expected...not at all."
4,Simple and Elegant,This item is perfect for every day wear - 'bright and shiny' without being gaudy or 'cheap' looking.
2,Not as good as it looks,"I bought this ring for my wife so she could wear something in place of her wedding ring when she didn't want to damage her real one. First of all, the price of the ring is cheap, so I know that I can't complain too much, however, when I got the ring, it was for a Christmas stocking stuffer. The picture showed a nicely wrapped package with a bow. What I got was a tiny package that was wrapped so poorly with a generic computer printed label with no bow. I had to unwrap it to redo the wrapping, which was a good thing anyways because I wanted to check out the ring. The center diamond is very pretty, however, it is set crooked and looks like it is about to fall out. The side bands look much cheaper than the picture. I don't think the small amount of money that I spent on this ring was even worth it. The nice thing is that the center band can be removed and worn as a solitare. Not exactly what I was going for, but oh well. I will probably return this ring."
2,Pretty BUT fades fast,"This is a beautiful ring however the rhodium plating wears of VERY quickly leaving the finish dull and very unattractive.I am really disappointed, this was going to be my ring while mine is being made but now it is just wasted money.As sad as it makes me because I do love the ring, I would not suggest you purchase this item as it will not last you long."
2,Beware of the Geometry chapter!,"I love this book: it's clear, concise, laid-out well...all except for the chapter dealing with Geometry. It appears to have been an afterthought, a very rushed addition on the author's/publisher's part. There are numerous typing mistakes, not to mention errors in the problems themselves. This chapter also isn't included in the answers in the back section, nor the student answers manual. Most disappointing of all, there was no mention of Geometry on the included cdrom.Shame on you, Mr. Angel and Prentice Hall. For this much money, I expect better."
1,ARE THEY NUTS?,"WHY STICK THE ""FIRST CLASS MAIL"" IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ENVELOPE? SURELY, COLUMBIAN COULD HAVE PRINTED THAT ABOUT TWO INCHES HIGHER SO ONE WOULD HAVE ROOM TO USE ONE OF THEIR 3.375 INCH HIGH ADDRESS LABELS UNDER THAT PRINTING. ALSO, WHY NO ""FIRST CLASS MAIL"" ON THE BACK? POORLY THOUGHT OUT!"
5,Amazing,"I have always hated the feel of the more "" watery"" and ""fragrant"" lotions. They also didn't seem to seep into my skin. THIS lotion is the king of kings! I used it for the first time when I got out of the shower, and it literally was like a smooth & thick frosting and it IMMEDIATELY sunk into my skin. In return I have wonderfully soft skin. I am addicted now. No fragrance, no false claims, no watery feel. This is a pure and simple thick lotion that serves up what it promises to do."
3,Originally bought for KP problem,"I originally bought this product because a website had said this type of lotion would help with my keratosis pilaris problem on my upper arms, but it did not. It's a great lotion to hydrate your skin and keep it extremely soft, but it didn't help my KP. I now use it as a hand lotion."
1,not sure how well it works but feels awful,"I have been trying the various eucerin alpha hydroxy lotions for the keratosis pilaris I've had on my arms since my teens. I have no idea how effective this cream is. After applying it, my skin felt like it had a thin layer of glue over it and attempting to wash my hands was like trying to take off scotchguard or something. The water just beaded up and resisted even soap. For me, not worth putting up with this discomfort even if it worked like a champ."
3,It Could Be Helpful,"Perhaps I didn't read the explanation of the book before I purchased it. I don't regret buying it, but it certainly wasn't what I wanted. It provides some good information about a lot of off the road, well, roads, but there aren't any stories to go with them. It provids some historical, geographical, and biological history of the areas it discusses, but if you are looking for great stories, this book isn't it. Buy this book if you are looking for directions not for enjoyment reading."
4,Perfect Little Ladder,"This ladder is lightweight, sturdy, and opens and closes easily. The non skid feet are a plus on all surfaces."
4,BUYER BEWARE!!,"Don't make the same mistake I've done. The picture here and even in a google image search does not match the actual ladder. I was looking for a 3' step ladder where you can stand on the top shelf, but this one is not the case at all as it has the molded plastic tray."
4,World War II's Number One Ace,"There is a lot more to being an Ace than flying an airplane. Richard Bong was a natural and he was in the right places at the right time. This is a good story which covers many of Bong's adventures and tells much about his famaily. There are many qoutes from his letters home. In one leter he tells how he and Tommy McGuire had lost thousands of dollars in a poker game, probably enough to buy a new home after the war, but who cared about money when you were risking your life every day in combat. I wrote THE LAST GREAT ACE and it dovetails with this book, telling the story of America's number two ace, Tommy McGuire.Since this book is hard to find General Kenney's book ""Richard Bong, Ace of Aces"" might be one to read."
2,Strawberry Failure,"The Pot is nice and the Soil that comes with the pot is nice too. But they only give you 10 seeds which only a few germinate. The two or three that did start to grow quickly died after two weeks. I tried this twice,with the exact same results.The picture shown of strawberry plants burting out of the pot is a joke.They could have doubled the seed count and given better care instructions on growing strawberries from seed."
2,Disappointing. Poor effort. Why was this book written?,"Imperial Earth seems like a book written to fulfill a contractual obligation. As I read this book I kept getting the feeling that Clarke had collected various notes he had written for ideas and tried to make a book out of them without much further effort. This is a very shallow book. Characters were poorly developed, and the story meandered with no purpose. At the end of the book I wondered why Clarke had introduced many (most?) of the characters and settings.Imperial Earth includes descriptions of Titan, where people live mostly underground but can go on the surface with oxygen and a thin thermosuit. The trip to Earth wasn't especially interesting. Descriptions of future Earth were given little historical background. Cultural changes were simply stated rather than explained.Way too many blanks were left for the reader to fill in. You might as well write your own book instead."
4,Highly entertaining and plausible for 70s Science Fiction,"This book weaves a human-interest story into the future of 2276 AD from the naivete of 1976, when the book was first published.I thought the best part of the book was Clarke's extrapolation of trends into the future. In some cases, he's right on the money, if two centuries late: HMS Titanic nostalgia, PCs, a sort of interplanetary internet, human cloning, disintegration of nation states, and the utter failure of the SETI program.The sections describing the interplanetary propulsion system, and its occasionally explosive development, was worth the price of admission.The descriptions of life on the moon Titan will have to wait for the culmination of the Cassini/Huygens mission for a reality-check. I suspect he'll be closer than anyone would have imagined. (2006! Where's Clarke's asymptotic drive when we need it!)"
2,Interesting but not thrilling,This book is rather boring. The futuristic images of Earth are quite interesting but a lot of the details about the characters are rather long and dull. I'd suggest you find a secon-hand copy of this book rather than buying a brand new one!
2,Poor execution,"I was hoping for an intriguing sci-fi read. What I got was a novel about a character I never connected with, who had a backstory which felt rushed and undeveloped.The problem is that one of the few plots in the novel involves his backstory and relationships with some characters who seem even less developed.Just not a well-executed effort."
3,"Good, but not a classic","Paul Rodgers is one of the most recognised voices in British Rock Music. Fronting the bands Free and Bad Company in the 60s and 70s, he was constantly voted best vocalist in magazine polls and rightly so. Listening to this album, it is clear that the voice remains undiminished. He can still rock with the best of them and sing those lilting ballads to perfection. However as good as Rodgers is, there are no real memorable tracks on this cd. Some ok rockers and melodic slow numbers, but nothing that really grabs you. All in all an Ok album, but its not Tons of Sobs or Straight Shooter."
3,No Top Dog ... but fun!,"Many readers were wondering how Jerry Jay Carroll would follow up on his magical and mystical Top Dog.Inhuman Beings almost seems to be a parody. Carroll utilizes surely one of the most threadbare sci fi plots ... aliens land on earth and take over human beings with an eye to taking over the planet. The alien-occupied humans seem almost like themselves but there is a giveaway that sets them apart. However, the aliens learn and adjust. Having taken over many of the people in power, their plan seems sure to succeed.Throw in a likeable hero, a love interest, some engaging bit players. Conclude with an improbable, miraculous plan that thwarts the intruders and saves earth. And there you have it.To say this for Carroll, he did make the tale engrossing and fun.But next time, I want Top Dog!"
2,Just not quite there,"Although I found the premise of this book promising -- a human wakes up as a dog in a fantasy world -- I couldn't even finish it. The writing style was one of my least favorite, being terse with virtually no descriptions, and little emotion. The main character was unlikeable, shallow and predictable. From the beginning I was rather irritated as the behaviour of the animals, take the wolves for example, was not not realistic. It was frustrating as the book had such great potential, but didn't quite get there."
4,"Jorgensen 6"" mini clamps","Not what I expected. Holds firm. The ""light duty"" description misleading. This is a good quality clamp."
3,Interesting but not the best ever,"Interesting read if you are fond of the Caribbean but some sections are obvious, painfully over-written, almost like high school creative writing class."
2,"Interesting, but overly pompous and flowery wording","Got this based on a ""top books on the Carribean"" review in one of the popular travel magazines. The book is old, so some of the word choice and writing style is very out of date. The descriptions of things, areas, and experiences are indeed very good and detailed, but the prose is so flowery that it comes across as very pompous and unnecessarilly wordy. I've never read a book with so many 4-5 syllable words strung together in almost every paragraph.If you're into interesting older books with flowery linguistics, this is a doosey. It does give you a clear sense of the experiences the authors had. So overall... it's a bit archaic, but gives an interesting sense of what it was like traveling in the Caribberan decades ago."
2,Very Basic Information,"While this book does contain many good rules of thumb for teachers to follow covering many aspects of the teaching experience, much of the information in this book is very basic and obvious. Most people who have had any experience in the classroom, even as a student teacher, would take many of the tips in this book for granted. This book would probably be the most helpful as an introduction for someone who has not taken any education classes and would like to become a teacher in his or her content area. If you are just graduating from an education program, skip this one."
2,Wrong Title,"""Empty Nesting: Reinventing Your Marriage When the Kids Leave Home"",I bought this book in hopes it would help with empty nesting (which should not even be part of the title), it is only about helping your marriage after your child(ren) leave home.Which if I bought it for that reason it is a good book.I do not like when people name their books to sell, instead of based on the real subject matter.I would have returned it if I had the time to do so."
5,LOST GEMS!,"This dvd has some very cool old footage, both black & white and color, along with some great songs. Especially good are Tina Turner, Richie Havens, and a hard-to-find Tim Rose clip. Also great to see the fashions of the time. Recommended, though I do wish there were some credits at the end!!"
5,Liked it!,"The ""one star"" reviewer must have been watching a different DVD than me! While it's true that SOME of the performances are black and white, most are in color, and they don't simply ""stand on a stage"". Most selections contain music videos of all sort. In my option, the song selection is terrific! The original artists perform the song and the DVD quality is very good."
3,Reviewing A Picnic In October,"A Picnic In October is about a family who goes to the Statue of Liberty each year on Lady Liberty's birthday. A young boy learns why his grandparents started this tradition.Grandma and Grandpa immigrated to the United States from another country due to harsh situations. As soon as they arrived in the U.S. they went to the Statue and thanked Her for letting them intor her country. So each year since they arrived, Grandma and Grandpa bring the whole family to Lady Liberty on her birthday for a picnic as a way of thanking her.The pictures fit the text well by helping the reader see and feel the emotions this story tells. The reader can see how important this event really was for the grandparents as well as the rest of the family."
3,A Picnic In October,"This book is about a boy and it's his grandma's birthday. They go to see the Statue of Liberty. They have a picnic and a wonderful time. The boy hates the party. Anyway, it has the most beautiful pictures. I recommend this book to people who love the Statue of Liberty."
4,Good read,"Good book, but it doesn't have a lot of action or suspense. I like a book I can't put down. This deals a lot with peoples emotions, which is also good."
3,"Quick, fun read","This was definately better than ""Cat of a Different Color"". Perhaps not the most realistic, but it's a good book to read if you want a whole lot of mystery and quirkiness going on."
5,excellent and divine,"I saw a book at the library about the subect I'm resarching:Sarah Bernhardt. You know how you know when you WANT something? I wanted that book. I didn't just want to borrow it, I wanted to OWN it. Well, I went on to Amazon.Com and there it was for less than I would have paid in late fees at the library. Beautiful condition. It came quickly and it's ALL MINE."
1,This is a game???,"This game is downright terrible, and it is a disgrace to all games out there.The Plot is retarded, you are a loser kid who gets sucked into a tv and you turn out following the last action heroThe gameplay is horrid. one button kicks, one button punches, and one button jumps. That is all. you fight the same kind of enemies over and over and over and over and over again until you just want to screamThe music is not really music, but its kinda catchy, but insanely cheezy.The sound is terrible, as kicks dont sound like kicks, punches sound like cardboard, and the grunts are just random noises.this game is a waste of time and money. I suggest a much better organized game, such as sonic blastman 2 or contra 3: the alien wars"
5,"God'""s Generals","This book has so much to teach us about the importance of prayer.. we all need to spend more time in prayer with the Father,, I have learned so much about prayer and that is vital to our fellowship and time with the Lord.. I would say get it to anyone who wants to know more about the Lord and His ways.."
4,Why They are Failing ?,"I would like to say the book is great. It is full of information, that is of value to all seekers of success and failures of past Generals. I do think that it is very interesting that the author, himself is choosing not to apply the many truths that he writes about in his own personal life. Point in case, He ( Roberts Liardon) attempted to sue Pastor Barry Cook wrongfully. I am aware of the fact that Barry Cook has done all within his power to bring healing and restoration to these recent accusations, brought on by Liardon. Liardon had one force guiding him, GREED. Because of his lack of good stewardship, he has and is having financial difficulties.It is sad when a man that has studied such Generals of our day, will bow to such a measure to bring heartbreaking accusations against a brother. Liardon, grow-up, be a man, and say your sorrow and lets get on with the Father's business."
4,God's Generals: Why they succeeded and why some failed,"Enjoyable biographies. However, I did not particularly enjoy the commentary interspersed with the biographies."
5,Great,Package came in so quickly! The book is very detailed and it does keep you reading. A very good buy.
5,great book,easy read very encouraging faith building would give this book to friends definitely a shareable book will read mor by this author
5,god's generals,"Amazing book to learn from about revivalists. To see and read what it takes to make it and maybe get some hints how to avoid mistakes, learn from the previous revivalists."
4,Enlighting and Encouraging Historical Biographies,I enjoyed this book very much. Twelve well researched and written historical biographies of 9 men and 3 women who's lives demonstrated the fruit of signs and wonders. The author uses their stories to encourage readers to stretch their faith in the future.
5,It's God -- Not Man,"Roberts Liardon shares the stories of 12 men and women who God used to make some of the biggest spiritual impacts on America in the last 100 years. He shows when and why they succeeded and when and why some failed. These lessons will encourage you to look past your own abilities and look past your own failures. It will put your focus back on God and remind you He can use anyone who is yielded to Him, remind you that He will not allow man to usurp His authority and glory."
3,Jewel fell out immediately,I opened the package and the jewel fell out of the holder. It's a handy little tool for the most part. It doesn't work well at a crowded table or a table with a table cloth. The purse holder falls off the table easily when the handbag is handled or bumped.
3,Seems to serve its purpose.,Just received it in the mail today. I got the plain mirror one because I think the jewels might eventually fall out of the others. I would prefer if the hook snapped into place instead of the magnets which definitely will not hold in my bag. I tried it out to see if it works and it holds to most surfaces with no problem. Even got it to hold on a file cabinet. You do need to play around with it on some surfaces though. The hook part also is a little small compared to others I've seen.It does seem overpriced and cheaply made. If I saw it in a store I wouldn't pay more than $10 maximum. If it ever breaks I would seek out a different brand and hope for a better quality.
5,Extremely handy!,"This purse hangar is indispensable! I use it all the time and am continually being complimented on it. It is sturdy, beautiful (I have the ruby), and so useful. I love that I do not have to put my purse on the floor anymore. This hangar fits almost all tables unless they are really thick. It is small enough and light enough to fit nicely in a purse, even a small one, and is pretty enough that you can use it in formal settings too."
3,Overpriced.,"Performs as promised, holding fairly heavy purses and folding up compactly. Struggles with straps wider than 1"" - holds them, but the strap doesn't exactly fit in the hook. If I would have seen this in person, at a store, I wouldn't have been willing to pay more than $7 for it - it looks like it was made in China at a cost of about $.50. So the fact that I paid almost $24 (shipping is included) is beyond ridiculous. If after reading this you are willing to throw away $20+ on one of these holders, I can only assume you make an astonishing amount of money."
4,good product,"i bought 3 at a time. two for my sisters birthdays and decided to get one for myself as well. i dont know if my sisters use theirs, but i use mine frequently. there have been times where i cant use the purse hanger due to tables being really wide. i guess its been 50/50. but when i do use it, it works great! comes in a black small box. dont toss it out without opening the inside as well. sisters almost tossed it without doing so. behind the purse hanger comes a little black velvet pouch. its quite nice. purse hanger when rolled up is about the size of a 50 cent coin. maybe a tad big larger. i would recommend."
5,Nice,"Very pretty, seems a tiny bit fragile for me though. Hooks nicely, but I sent it back and kept a different one which is a little more hefty. I'm rough on stuff like this and I carry a heavy bag. For a small-medium size bag, I'd feel good about it.BTW, none of these will work on tables with curved or beveled edges. I don't know how you'd design one that would work, but it would be nice. On straight edge tables, works well. It helps if you unfold it, hand your purse on it while holding it, and then slide it on the table or counter."
5,Beautiful,This is more beautiful than the picture. It's made well and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I would definitely recommend this item.
5,"So far, so good.",Bought two of these for stocking stuffers....girls loved 'em and they seem to be pretty sturdy. Will post a follow-up after extended use...
3,From a Charlestonian's point of view:,"Oh, I really wanted to adore this book. I was all set to be completely blown away by it. And the opening bits I did like. Sort of a Dave Barry does Charleston. But the momentum wasn't sustained, for me. There were moments where amusement would surge up again, but it was uneven. I think that for someone who is not a local, it would be even harder. We do have such quirky characters and types here, and Geer did a good job of capturing many of them. But for me, I'd built the book up so much in my mind before reading it, that I came away a little disappointed.But not disappointed enough to keep me from picking up another book by Mr Geer or to keep me from keeping track of his writing and lectures from this point on! I think he'd probably be a fantastic speaker-- very entertaining."
1,Not worth owning,"There is nothing particularly noteworthy about this book. Many of the pictures are reversed negatives, making the shells ""sinistral,"" or reversed...a big oversight to shell collectors worth their weight in salt. Many of the specimens are ordinary, not intrinsically special in form or in color. It is as if the photographer simply took fairly nice photos of whatever happened to be at hand -- which is not acceptable. Where is Oliva porphyria? Conus dalli? (color/pattern) Malea ringens? Stellaria solaris? (form) My mind nearly boggles with the missed opportunities here! There are so many other existing shell books that are superior to this (The Shell, Abott, 1968, well worth owning, being a classic of the type) that I am speechless as to why this one was published. Compared to what could have been it adds very little indeed, and is not worth owning."
2,Just OK,"This book is a bit misleading and dissapointing. With over 90,000 species of seashells I see no reason to repeat so many photographs of the same seashell.Deduct the 6 repeats of the Nautilus,5 of the paper Nautilus,4 of the Sea Urchin,,,the list goes on.In actual count the Tile ""100 Seahells"" should be ""100 Photographs of 52 Seashells"""
1,Seashell Book-missing several pages.,"The first book I received had about 10 pages that had nothing printed on them (thus making it less than one hundred seashells). I returned it to Amazon and asked for another. The second copy came shrink wrapped, but the same pages were missing print. This had to be a bad ""run"" from the company that Amazon purchased from, and no matter how many I returned I would not get a good copy. I really like the book, and would purchase it from someone who doesn't have a whole bad ""run"" of them."
2,Very disappointing package and condition,"All I can say is BIG disappointment! Not with the photographer, or the shell book content but the quality of the ""good, like new condition"" stated by the seller. First the book was tossed in a large box with NO additional padding so the book must have slid around and bounced about the box it was in, it also had no sealed plastic cover and so the dust jacket was scratched up badly & the icing on the cake---there was a small balled up piece of newspaper stuffed on top of the cover, seriously? My 4 year old can pack something better totally unsupervised & you do this professionally? BIG FAIL! This was a gift & I was embarrassed giving it. Please be honest with your products condition & youtube a ""how to pack"" video."
2,"Good, if you already KNOW Lakota","I bought both CDs Level One and Level Two. It starts and goes completely through with a guy just talking in Lakota. There is NO ENGLISH at all, and nothing to look at or refer to. I was really hoping to learn Lakota, but just listening to a foreign language with nothing to LEARN the language from, is nearly impossible. If you just want to hear the language spoken, this might be for you. I am greatful Amazon caries something such as this, but as is...it is pretty useless."
4,Over Priced,This product is WAY over priced. I bought the same thing for $4.29 at my local Safeway and K-Mart. My two dogs love them and I give them as a treat.
5,Wedding topper,"This is cute, I just wish they came in brunette. It was bigger than I expected and made of very durable material."
5,Histarical!,I bought this as part of a grooms cake topper and it was perfect! It pulled the whole thing together! The topper arrived in perfect condition and it arrived quickly. I would recommend this topper to anyone!
4,Very Good Biography of Franklin,"To me this book was a good, solid biography. I particularly liked Mr. Isaacson's shrewd assessments of Franklin and his motives.I did not find Mr. Isaacson's style as flowing as others but it was not pedantic. The book felt as though it was a larger book that had been scaled down in size. What it lacks, for the most part, is what Ron Chernow included in his biography of Alexander Hamilton.For example, descriptions of others around Franklin. Mr. Isaacson does have descriptions of those most germaine to Franklin's life, but Mr. Chernow has a number of portraits of others as well which gives depth to, and a fuller picture of, events often missing fron Mr.Issacson's book.Further Mr. Chernow writes at greater length and depth about the issues of the times. Mr. Isaacson seems to be less in depth and descriptive of the larger issues.I did like this book but would not put it in the same class as, say, Ron Chernow's ""Alexander Hamilton"" or David McCullough's ""John Adams""."
3,Abridged,"I listened to the Audio version of this book. It was abridged to 7 hours, which is simply too brief to contain this brilliant man's life. The audio version was constantly racing from one series of events to the next, without pausing to gain insight into Franklin's abilities and motives. After listening to this book I heard how Franklin became a great writer, publisher, politician, and even discovered electricity (!!), yet I have no clearer idea how he was able to accomplish these things nor what his own thoughts and motiviations were.One of the more interesting parts was to hear how Franklin's unique and brilliant character was interpreted in the following centuries. I was surprised to hear the intense criticism of his pragmatism by the Romantics.The audio book is great for a summary of Franklin and his accomplishments without much emotional insight. The unabridged version may be better."
4,A fabulous reading of a fabulous book,"I disagree with the reviewer who thought the CD version is ""boring."" I found it to be very engaging. Additionally, it's an appropriate abridgement--it's not so short you lose the flavor of the book and the fun details. As for the book itself, it was interesting enough to hold my attention, and I generally hate biographies."
5,I finally understand Ben,This is the most insightful book on this significant icon of American history. I couldn't put this book down. Definitely worth the investment.
2,"Insightful, yes...entertaining, no.",If you want to learn about Ben Franklin this is a fine read. If you want to be entertained try something else. Isaacson's style is ponderorus and lacks energy and flow. Who would have thought that Franklin's wonderful life could be recounted in such boring detail.
2,A bit boring,"I wasn't blown away by this one. A bit to spilled to follow, with too many unrelated facts. Pain to read in general."
5,Riveting stuff,One of the most fascinating biographies I've read. I did not know that Franklin contributed quite so much throughout his life. Very readable and absorbing.
3,Verbose Ben,"While the book is interesting, it reads too much like a text book to really be an entertaining read for me."
4,Very Enjoyable,"Benjamin Franklin: An American Life is, overall, a very decent book mainly because it is very readable and accessible. However, it does fall short as for the depth and analysis of Franklin's character. After finishing to read this book, I didn't get the sense that I truly understand who Franklin really was, but nonetheless it was enjoyable. I can recommend this book to anyone who is interested in a light read on a very fascinating person."
5,"A fun, very readable biography","I read this and the H.W. Brands ""The First American: The Life and Times of Benjamin Franklin"" around the same time and think they're both great. Isaacson's book is the more readable, pop culture-appropriate one while still being very in-depth and scholarly. Brands may start out as a rehash of Franklin's autobiography but quickly becomes an exceedingly well-researched, minute-by-minute account of Franklin's life.The best way to look at it is this way: if you're interested in reading about Benjamin Franklin, read the Walter Isaacson and you'll learn everything you could possibly want to know. If you're going to be doing a paper on Franklin and need to get all the nuts and bolts plus direction in finding further research, read the Brands."
3,insightful but stiff,"This book has interesting insight, and seems to have very accurate historical facts and finds. However the writting style makes reading more than 5 pages at a time seem tedious. The book does not draw you in and is not a story book even in the slightest, and much of the verbage or launguage used seems un-neccessarily obscure. I recently read ""1776"" by David McCullough, and though a historical book it was great and easy reading, this book is not!"
4,Great book!,"A very interesting book. I like the chronological time line with distinct chapters. While he was an amazing man in some respects, I was disappointed in his treatment of his family. I think the author did a great job of balancing the good and the not so good of Franklin's life. All in all, a very well rounded account."
5,Isaacson's Portrait more detailed than any painting,"Walter Isaacson has done remarkable things with his book ""Benjamin Franklin""He has:1) added a valuable and important work to the immense canon available on Benjamin Franklin.2) written with subtlety, grace, and realism about world changing events and an enigmatic subject that are often mythesized beyond common empathy.3) kept the book and the subject approachable and human.4) made a long and complex life engaging, well explained, and fun.I recommend this book without reservation. Well done, Sir."
5,A Good Read,"Isaacson writes an outstanding biography on one of our most enduring founding fathers. Benjamin Franklin was a remarkable man who would still be in our history today without the Revolution. His contributions to the American way of life are amazing in the breath of accomplishments: establishment of a free library, founding the postal system for the then colonies, forming a fire brigade in Philadelphia, helping to establish a militia in PA to his famous lightning experiments and other inventions. Isaacson brings Franklin's life to life (so to speak) by quoting Dr. Franklin throughout the text. It is an engaging read that fills out the man, warts and all."
4,Great book to learn about a Great Man,"I enjoyed this book. It took Ben Franklin out of that gray area between important founding founder and silly character that many people have in their heads. It wasn't afraid to show some of his faults, his family life left much to be desired. It is funny that while reading John Adams you would get a not too flattering view of Franklin and after reading this book you might not favor Adams.I recommed this book for anyone interested in Franklin. Even if you think you know Franklin, read the book to learn something new. From reading books such as this you understand the trial and tribulations of giving birth to not only a new but great nation."
2,Underwhelming,"This biography had its moments, but Isaacson was far too enamored of Franklin, and did not present a balanced view. He was overly critical of Adams, but failed to be objectively critical of Franklin (or the other Founding Fathers) in return. Franklin is the Founding Father I'd most like to meet, but this biography is far too flattering, and really, rather dull. Isaacson is a serviceable writer, but does not make the story really come alive."
2,This is a pretty dull Biography,"The author tries hard to convince you that Franklin is this superstar world leader, but just doesn't sell it very well. I believe Franklin is everything that history makes him out to be, but this book is written in such a dull manner that you never really get it. I guarantee everyone who has read this book paused halfway through it and were relieved to discover that the last 50 pages are appendices and such ending the misery much earlier."
5,Yay!,"I'll keep it short and sweet. It's a long book, but Isaacson's a helluva biographer, and Franklin's a helluva person."
5,Not Your Typical Biography,"Walter Isaacson has written a wonderful biography of the oldest of America's famous founding fathers. I just finished it and must say I was pleasantly surprised that it was in the most down to earth language of any biography I have ever read (with the possible exception of Norman Thomas Remick's semi-biography of Jefferson called ""West Point: Character Leadership.. Thomas Jefferson""). Yet, Walter Isaacson (like the Remick book) drew his water from the well of original readings and writings of his subject, not from the endless circle of other authors' opinions and interpretations. Those two things, easy-to-understand writing and primary research, are what make this book outstanding."
2,"History through the 1-dimensional, MSM-biased lense of the former head of CNN","The book is generally good, albeit dull at times, but the author's tendency to play up the strengths and downplay the weaknesses of individuals he considers to be ""liberal heroes"" (e.g., Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, etc.) and to slam those he considers to be ""conservative villains"" (e.g., John Adams, John Dickinson) is shallow and irritating, but not surprising from the former Managing Editor of TIME magazine and Chairman and CEO of CNN. The same lense through which both TIME and CNN spin, I mean, report current political news is the lense through which the author distorts the descriptions of certain historical figures at times in the book."
2,"Franklin was a scientist, not a fool","Contrary to urban legend he did not ""discover"" electricity nor did he fly a kite to capture electricity from lightening. He was a better scientist than that. Was this author careful with the research?"
2,From the left,"Mr. Isaacson seems to come from the left. After reading John Adams by David McCullough, I considered Adams an American hero. McCullough did as well, having begun a biography on both Jefferson and Adams and continuing only with Adams, finding him a much fuller character. However, Isaacson has nothing but disparagement for Adams. He considers him a Puritannical figure who just made life difficult for Franklin, the most tolerant of men. He seems to much prefer Franklin's brand of morality to Adams'. There's either balance or good judment missing, I believe."
3,Benjamin Franklin:An american life,Ya have to turn the music off and pay attention.One of the better offerings on the subject.
2,a bit TOO biased,"I love biographies, however not when the facts are skewed in favor of the person being chronicled. Even at his worse, the author has managed to justify Franklin's actions. If you like rantings about every specific detail or want have your opinion about Franklin already made for you, then this book is for you."
3,Decent,"Neither a character study nor a narravative, but a little of both, this book never finds a rhythem. You will not feel you wasted your time with the book and will most certainly learn something if you have read little of Franklin previously.I commend the author for trying but the work never quite makes it up to the higher level of biograhies."
3,Audio Version: Content + Presentation -,"This is a revealing and fascinating study that seems to me just a bit too generous to Franklin. (The monument in the Old Granary Burial Ground that he erected to the memory of his parents is evidence of an enormous ego.) Unfortunately, the audio book version is annoying -- too many mispronunciations and wrong inflections -- but worst of all, the reader tries to use foreign accents for British and French characters and regional and 'historical' pronunciations when he is speaking the words of American characters. The result is too precious and too amateurish, and altogether offputting. Take the time to read it in print. Better yet, read it in conjunction with McCullough's John Adams for balance."
2,"Ben Franklin ""Lite""","Having first read H. W. Brand's ""The First American: The Life and Time of Benjamin Franklin"", I was extremely disappointed in Isaacson's effort. Quite frankly, it reads much like one would expect to find not in a good biography, but in the pages of Time magazine - simple, uncomplicated, and very light on the facts (though Isaacson freely offers his and other historians opinions throughout the book). If you want a thorough and well written biography of Franklin, you'll much prefer Brand's book to this one."
2,overexposed,"Isaacson ought to be embarrassed by the shameless hype this book got from his old cronies at Time and CNN.It's not a bad book but it's just not in the same league with HW Brands' ""The First American,"" which is both more scholarly and readable -- despite getting almost no notice in the general media.Take a pass on this and pick up Brands' book if you want a thorough review of Franklin's fascinating life."
2,"A decent protrayal, but not very interesting","This reads like most history books: dry and boring. The only reason I actually finished the book, is because the author did do extensive research, which, despite the boring writing style, I was willing to suffer through to gain more knowledge and facts about B.F."
2,Unfortunately Disappointed,"If you're looking for an uplifting inspiring book about a great man this unfortunately is not it. I found it to be focused and even bent to show a faulty man who did some great things but seemed to dull the edge of what was a very sharp man. It had of course alot of good information, it just seemed to be directed in a somewhat negatively interpreted manner for the authors own purposes or personality."
1,Franklin's life - every last detail of it!,"Isaacson seems to prove that editors need editors. This book is one tedious read. We are told about details of Franklin's life that provide absolutely no useful insights. Isaacson seems to want simply to show us how thorough was his research. Our founding fathers gave birth to a busy nation - we've got better things to do than labor through this tome. Franklin was a printer. Isaacson has wasted more ink on this book than Franklin probably used in his entire life. Spare us the details, Mr Isaacson!"
2,Benjamin Franklin: An American Fraud,"What a Franklinfest this turned out to be. ""Statesman, inventor, all-around-swell guy."" Well, I guess that's one way to look at Ben. But another way is to focus on his elitist attitude and absolute lack of respect for people of color in his manic push to establish this country. He was swell alright, if you were a white, British aristocrat, but a nightmare to everyone else. Arrogant, egotistical. He was never shy to tell others how to live their lives. As mentioned in this book, he even had the audacity to rewrite parts of the Constitution that Jefferson had painstakingly labored over. What a jerk.I loved the mention of the kite-flying incident, however."
1,Incredibly boring...,"This was one of the worst books that I have ever dragged myself through. Our bookclub decided to read this thing based on all of the rave reviews. It is a great example of why you shouldn't trust reviews. Perhaps if you are a history maniac, this book would entertain you. For the rest of us, it brought back memories of college history classes that we just wanted to 'get through'.Wow. This book was a total waste of time (lots of it) and money. My college-aged son said that he would drop a class if Benjamin Franklin was on the reading list. My daughter (senior in high school) loves history, but said that she would draw the line at a 500+ page book about Benjamin Franklin.I should have listened to my kids instead of the reviewers."
1,Need to buy again,The book was not in very good condition. Some pages were very loose and the cover was in just ok shape. I feel the need to buy this book again because I don't like reading a book I have to take such care with that it may fall apart.
5,Ben Franklin: An American Life,"Mr. Isaacson is an excellent biographer and his subject was an interesting man I was reminded of all that Franklin had invented that we still are using today. It is a detailed but interesting story it didn't get bogged down with too much detail like some books do. When I was in school back when dinosaurs roomed the earth all we did in history class was remember names, dates, and discoveries or events not much on the personal lives of the great men who started this new enterprise called the United States and Ben Franklin was a very big part of that aside from his inventions. This book has information on everything about Franklin including his personal life and thoughts on humanism. I think you will like this book and look for others by this author."
4,Review of Kindle Version,"The Kindle version has 9 stories instead of 8. They add ""Greenshaw's Folly"" from ""Adventures of the Christmas Pudding"". It also has additional material about Miss Marple novels. I enjoyed several of the stories, such as ""Sanctuary"", but found others to be absurd. The ""Dressmaker's Doll"" and ""In a Mirror Darkly"" where really about the supernatural, quite unlike what I come to expect from Agatha Christie, where the supernatural always ends up having a logical explanation. I was waiting in both cases for Poirot or Miss Marple to come in and explain it, but both stories end abruptly leaving many questions unanswered."
2,Miss Marple's Final Cases: And Two Other Stories (Masterpiece Edtn,I found them very boring. I am sorry I got them!I would not likely recommend them!Give a better outline so one know what to expect.
3,Skimpy selection; very cute color illustrations,"As a long-time participant in alt.quotations, I inhaled this book in twenty minutes. The drawings are colorful and very funny. This would be a good buy for your favorite middle school child."
2,Surprising!,Hard to believe that someone this overtly religious would be allowed to be a Judge (separation of church and state?) in the Federal Judicial System. More proof that the system is broken and in vast need of repair.
5,Viet Nam Vet,It brought me right back to my time and place in Nam. The characters were believable. The backdrop the RSSZ was accurately portrayed. Capt Nelson nailed it. Very entertaining.
4,"""Food"" for thought...","This second of Bearfoot's books (written ten years later) is much easier to read and absorb than his initial publication (""The Calcium Factor""). It covers much of the same material but in prose more in tune with the average reader. You can make up your own mind about his claims for the product for which he is most well known (coral calcium) but this book makes for compelling reading and is definitely worth considering."
1,This Book is Misleading,"While the authors make some points, their conclusions are scientifically unacceptable and not subject to proper testing and peer review.The authors have a religious type of message to deliver and, in matters of health, it is dangerous to rely on those who are evangically passionate.Their motive is obvious - to sell supplement and it is not needed. While calcium is obviously important to health, there are sufficient quantities in many foods or simpler supplements.Antecdotal ""proofs"" should be regarded with extreme caution - lots of people will attest to seeing UFO's too!"
3,Breadth but no depth,I would agree with the other reviewer. Many topics covered but none with any real depth. Would have much preferred to have more written on care and shaping and less written on propagating and displaying. There is so little on pests and diseases I don't know why they even bothered to include it.
4,Good Product for 50 bucks less than ipod,At first I had some problems with the m500 freezing up but I called motorola and was told to download a firmware update .After I downloaded the firmware update this mp3 player worked like a charm. It has an FM player and more memory for less money than the ipod mini. I would reccomend it to anyone.
4,Best for the price,"I could care less about a color screen or a scroll wheel. I wanted a good player that has a small form-factor and good battery life. Even with a good pair of earbuds - I got the Sony MDR-EX71SL Fontopia Headphones, it was within my budget. I couldn't have made a better choice.I upgraded the firmware like all other reviewers. Has worked since without any problems. The software crashes on all the machines that I have tried - I was not expecting too much from Motorola software :)The FM tuning/working is not too great. Works well if its grounded. So for good reception, you've to carry it in your palm."
4,Great Player - Outstanding Value,"I've had the Motorola M500 for two weeks now. Overall, this is a great player. Very user friendly, very good audio quality, FM tuner, 5GB capacity, and the best battery life of any player I've seen in this catagory. (Mine went over 28 hours on a charge.) I opened an Amazon credit account, and got $30 off the price; making the total cost under $110. The only negative is the rather small screen."
2,good while it lasted,"when i first recieved this player i was so happy with it's performance and for the price the amount of space is phenominal when compared with other brands. The device is easy and convinient to use, the joystick works well and the unit is a nice convinient size and weight.the included software, is basic and i prefered using window's media player b/c it is much more user friendly.My player had about 1200 songs on it and aside from a bit of extranious noise the player made i was happy with its overall performance and battery life. The player one day however wouldnot turn on, the opening screen would appear and then the player cuts blank even when plugged in and with a new battery. i am verry disapointed in this player, especially to find that i am not one of few whose players have simply refused to work, i would not reccomend that anyone buy this player, spend the extra bucks and get an ipod."
2,Customer Service Nightmare,"I now own three of these, and my computer will not recognize any of them. It works on my mother's computer and on my sister's computer, and they both love it (I'll be giving them each one for their birthday) but it doesn't work on mine or my boyfriend's, and Motorola's customer service was unable to tell me why or refund my money. After about 90 minutes on the phone with them, they sent me a replacement, which didn't work either. After another 2 hours on the phone with them (including hold time), they sent me another one. Each time, they were supposed to have UPS pick up the old one- and each time, UPS did not come.The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because clearly, it works with some computers, and for those people it might be great. If you want to try this product, buy it locally and be sure you can return it if it doesn't work. However, my recommendation is that you don't support Motorola at all- buy an iPod or a Creative product instead."
5,EXCELLENT,This is the best. It is easy to use and different from all the rest. It holds tons of songs and is very user friendly when dowloading CD's. The joystick is so easy to use and fun that I would never buy anything else
2,McFarlane's Dracula - A bit on the gross side for my taste,"Although it is a very well sculpted figure, this Dracula figure falls into the mold of being a wee bit on the gross side with its accessories. It comes with several rats ostensibly meant to be snacks for the Count, as well as several bats to hang on the hooked chains in his cape. This is a minor nitpick, I'm just not a big fan of McFarlane's recent trend of rats as toy accessories. The face is very batlike and inhuman, reminscent of a cross between the vampires of Buffy and Radu of Subspecies fame. If you like your monsters base and visceral, check him out, otherwise you might want to stick with the Mummy and Frankenstein figures in this line."
3,Great music - terrible video quality,"To me, the 5 star ratings given to this DVD grossly overstate the quality of this production. While the music is great and Pavarotti and partners offer a magnificent performance, the video quality is terrible, the head and faces in the scenario wide takes are featureless spots while in the first planes the faces appear blurry and dark, spoiling the whole viewing experience."
3,A good production of the Puccini war-house with a caveat on the sound and picture quality,"Puccini's famous Opera receives a spirited performance in this landmark production from the Met.The sound and video quality are limited but it's amazing they are as good as they are given this was filmed live for television in 1977.Has there ever been a better Rodolfo than Pavarotti? He produces effortless tone and diction and, still in his prime, he fits the role of a struggling young writer perfectly.Scotto is a bit old to be a Mimi but quite good.Maralin Miska steals the show as Musetta.(****) for the performance and (**) for the muffled sound and murky picture."
3,For historical reasons only,I now have 4 La Bohemes after reading carefully the fine reviews. Having reviewed the four versions and comparing them for total experience this is worth getting only to see Pavarotti and Scotto probably in their primes vocally. Neither of them really fit as Rodolfo and Mimi (stout and past age 40) and this was shot before the MET figured out how to shoot a live performance as they now do. Many times the singers are in the dark due to poor stage lighting. So get it for the great voices even though Pavarotti misses the high C. For total enjoyment get the movie with Natrebko and Villazon; and if you want to see a sublimely wicked Musetta. Niska is not a terribly convincing Musetta in this version. But get this for your video library only as a historical moment in opera.
1,"The Sound is BAD, BAD.. Bad!!","I had this on video- I recorded this when it originally aired- always loved it. I never had the complete opera though. But the sound was Excellent. In THIS DVD the SOUND STINKS. So much so that i find it Un-listenable. I suppose if you've never heard this with ""good"" sound you might like it- still- It just loses everything. HORRIBLE TRANSFER. Strange sound that detracts from everything. Trust me."
5,The Websters Instant Word Guide is a valuable tool !,"I first used the Websters Instant Word Guide in 1977 when I was working as a word processor. It is a quick & handy tool to use when you just need to know how to spell a word - or want to verify its spelling. I have used this book throughout my career whether it be for documentation or again - just needing to check on the spelling of a word. I went to use my ""original"" book the other day and it was literally falling apart - so needed to be replaced. Luckily - they are still publishing it. So I am now on my 2nd one - 32 years later."
5,Great For Classrooms,"I've been using this book in my classroom for years. While technology is great for help with spelling - this little book is easily accessible to my students at their desks as we do not have computers for every student. By having the book on their desk where they can easily access it - they remain focused on the task at hand. If they had to get up and go to one of the class computers to look up a word they might loose their train of thought - especialy in the writing process. I have found that students will use this book to check spelling, but they are reluctant to use the dictionary for help with spelling. A must have in the classroom and at home."
3,Teeny tiny good book,"I wanted to hate this book when I got it, but it grew on me. The first thing I didn't like was that some of the recipes used dips (bean dip, mostly) as ingredients, but after thinking about it, I realized that most canned bean dips were pretty tasteless. There aren't too many original recipes here, but it gives you the basics, which isn't bad for a tiny little book like this.Give it a try. I still have it in my kitchen for reference."
5,Awesome product,This is a must have for anybody who works on cars because it is truly universal and made short work of pulling my steering wheel off my 76 f250
1,bad adveritsing,"It says it is a skinny narrow time, but it is just a regular tie, nothing else... really disappointed with the pics they advertise."
5,Just started the product,I just started using this product for about 2 weeks and I can see change I am light skin African american female... and im loving my results :) ....I will definatly be using there products more often I also Model so it keeps my skin one smooth complextion
5,just good!!,been using it for some years now and it's good for my skin...so..it's all i use!!!!:)..very nice product!!!
4,Great!,"I love this product. It moisturizes without being thick or greasy. I have already noticed some darker areas are beginning to fade. My skin is brown and the dark spots that are fading is noticeable. It has a nice smell and leaves my skin feeling very soft. The ony problem I have with this product is that the bottle seems small. If I were to use it every day like the instructions suggest I will run out quickly. Unfortunately my face did not agree with this product. I think it might be the sunscreen in it that made me break out a little. But otherwise, I will be buying it again."
4,I think it works but...,"I think this stuff is doing the trick to lighten the post-acne marks on my shoulders, upper arms and back, but now I'm starting to develop itty bitty bumps all over my arms where I applied it. It is VERY moisturizing...maybe it's clogging up my pores? I don't know. Maybe I'll try more regular exfoliation on those areas to try and counteract that side effect. Otherwise, works fine, and you can't beat the price, can you?"
4,Deminishes skin blemishes,"After trying a number other moisturizing and blemish removing skin lotions, my wife settled on this one and has recommended it to several of her friends."
1,why?,"I don't understand why they made this cd... I bought it thinking that it would be the musicians adding a little bit of themselves to the music, their own creativity.. they didnt, it is just a copywhat is next? Darke side of the Moon, that sounds exactly like the original? I dont get it...."
3,It seems hard to beat masterpiece,"Even having the greatest names in prog-rock available for this project,former YES man BILLY SHERWOOD couldn't do a much.It is only a good copyof the original Roger Waters WORK,nothing different in sound or arrangements.I would expect more,especially from the men mentioned in credits.They should try harder,put new spirit in that old classic album.I still like it,it's worth the money.But those guys have too much respectfor Waters and Pink Floyd."
3,"Interesting, but couldn't reach me","Faithfull singing (and playing), some intelligent takes, some less. I don't think this can bring a new light on Waters' masterpiece - it is not a very subtle reading. The way the music is played here doesn't seem to help the script. The Wall - live in Berlin is a much better experience in this respect."
2,A tribute to literalness.,"You've gotta be kidding! Sure, it's all expertly played, but it's so slavishly FAITHFUL that what's the point? Got news for you, friends, it ain't a tribute to play something ""correctly"" in a popular music idiom, it's a waste of time! Spend the money you would've laid out for this on Luther Wright and The Wrong's REBUILD THE WALL. Now THAT'S a tribute!"
5,classic nature studies text with illustrations,"Holding and browsing through this text is a quiet pleasure. All intrested in outdoor nature study, all relishing acurate and artfully composed illustrations will enjoy 'visiting' with this text, even for brief section readings.The date of this press, the books craftmanship, the paper quality, the colors and acuracy of the illustrations a joy to hold in hand.What a treat after an outdoor hike in wetlands, or along a pond bank!"
2,Not at all a Story about Betty and Mahtob Mahmoody,"For the Love of a Child is a hodge-podge of very similar stories and the reader can become confused as to which parents Betty is referring to. The book's first couple of chapters is about their very interesting return to the U.S. and how they had to re-adapt to their former life, but the rest of the book is wholly about other left-behind parents' stories. Most of the book contains incessant ""name dropping"" and how Betty has dedicated her life to travelling the world speaking about the plight of left-behind parents all the while leaving the reader to wonder in who's care she would always be leaving her child Mahtob, especially since she repeatedly mentions the looming threat of the return of her husband, Moody. The book could be a bit boring especially the story about the ""Mother of Algiers"" and often she refers to people in which the reader does not recall because the stories were numerous, redundant and poorly developed for any hope of retention."
1,Unbelievable,"Betty keeps pushing all this supposed love for her child but the actions appear to be more out of wanting to be in control of everyone than out of love. Love has no limits, no boundaries and no issues of control. Loving a child means doing what is best for that child beyond your own issues and your own selfishness. Ripping a family apart instead of addressing the issues as an adult and then using those difficulties to make a living off of seem to be more control and selfishness than love for a child. The book seemed to exude satisfaction for the revenge and used love of a child as an excuse for that behavior."
1,Riduculous,"Ridiculous to publish anything like this. Sounds as if a vengeful writer just can't let go of her mistake in life. How many marriages does it take to know you need help in relationships? How much control some women want. Even of their own children. Personally I saw the whole situation as a matter of control by both parties. A lot of people have custody battles. The Dr. did what he had to do to try to secure his parental rights too didn't he? Didn't he realize that if the writer filed for divorce that she would use the child as a leverage for alimony and support? After all he was a doctor and Betty was, well, what? I give the man credit for at least trying to keep his child in the only avenue he had to do that. Why isn't a ""0"" offered in these reviews?"
1,The Best Love,"The best love this woman could give her child is the love and relationship she deserved to have with her father. It is not too late but it will most likely be impossible to reestablish. The ignorance and exaggerations in the book and probably in the home life of the child will have now been established and only if the girl learns to think and decide things for herself instead of allowing her mother to do that for her, only then can there be a chance. I am curious as to who will be answering for what when judgement comes. Someone will be very embarrassed in front of God and Mahtob. The book seemed overwritten and still vengeful in a sickening way trying to make it sound justified. Bad Book...Bad Situation"
4,"""CLOSE TO PERFECTION""","Actually more like 4.5 stars. I can't believe that some people don't like this CD! This is a classic ""Loudness"" CD that should have never been released in English. There was simply no need to change anything about this great Metal CD. The production is very good and the band continues their conceptual album covers with this release. In my opinion, this CD is #3 behind #1 ""The Law of Devil's Land"" and #2 ""Devil Soldier"" CD's. It's too good not to have in your Metal collection. Just listen to the song ""Milky Way"" and you'll be blown away! These guys really ROCK!!!"
4,Top of the pile...,"This is THE Loudness album to own: certainly many are good, if you're into powerful yet singable heavy metal. The 80s have not been kind (in retrospect) to many bands, but Loudness remains a quality team over time. They had a lucky combination of things: catchy songwriting, speed and power when necessary, GREAT guitar chops (an essential for 80s metal!), and good-quality recordings.I'd have to say that Disillusion has the best production of all their albums, just the right combination between raw and polished. It shoudl appeal to those who like the sound of bands like Van Halen, Judas Priest, or Alcatrazz, a sharp combination of pop and metal.Both the English version and Japanese version are excellent. With this band, I have no preference for either... I did not enjoy their later ""English only"" albums as much - they seemed too Westernized and much slicker."
2,Caution: Older versions of the 'Compleat Theory',"While a useful and interesting historical document,no earlier printing of this book should be confusedwith Roderick D. Cannon's scholarly 1994 masterpiece.ISBN 1-898405-41-7All pre-1994 printings (some dating back to the late1700's) are based on a poorly handwritten copy ofJoseph MacDonald's original manuscript. Many obviouserrors were left in place by the well-intentioned editors,with the expectation that later scholars would be able tosort them out.Buy any pre-1994 version for a good and useful senseof the content, or possibly as a collector's item, but don'trely on it for accurate details.Roderick Cannon had access to MacDonald's originalmanuscript, and includes photographs of that document,along with a wealth of supplemental material. His 1994version deserves 5-Stars! I own both types, and thedifferences are astonishing."
4,very solid unit,I have had the unit for around 2 months. I was surprised when the heater came-it was in a huge box with excellent wrapping to keep it safe in another box and then finally in its regular box for sale purposes. Unit was larger than I had thought it would be but I guess I just didn't read the descrip. correct. It seems to be a very heavy duty unit with a thick cord and easy to figure out controls. i hope it can withstand the occasional punishment my fish sometimes put heaters through. I am thinking of covering it with a supported rock to give it even more protection.
5,The best aquarium heater you can buy!,"I have had a 55 gallon aquarium for over 30 years and this is by far the best most efficient heater I have ever used. I highly recommend the product and the seller, five stars"
3,Not what I expected,Even though it wasn't up to what I was expecting it is still a great little book for the beginner. Easy to read and full of information.
4,Design is good; QC could be better,"I bought 2 of these 48"" Cabinet Masters through Amazon for $23.97 each. At that price, they were a steal. However, one of the clamps arrived with the jaws jammed together. This problem, it seems, has been widely reported. I cannot understand why it has not been addressed, now that the clamp has been out as long as it has (unless the sale priced units I bought were from old inventory). It was easy enough to unjam them with a screwdriver but I would not want to have to do that while glue is setting up. So, I'd hesitate to buy more of these at full price (& maybe would consider the new Jet alternative, which has some innovative features.)"
4,Can't take the pressure!,"5/17/06 These clamps sure look the part, but they won't hold up under the pressure. On both of the clamps I bought, the internal washer snaps out of postion violently when under a good bit of hand tighting; and could possibly break apart as may have happened to a couple of other reviewers. I believe this area of the clamp was poorly engineered. I'll stick with the Besseys. I gave it 1 star on this date.8/15/06 Update to this review: The company sent me replacements heads for these clamps, and so far they seem to be working good. I'll change my approval rating after I've put them to the test for awhile longer7/4/10 Update to this review. Everything is still working fine; they must have figured out the defect. I don't prefer them over Besseys though, but they do the job now, and based on this subsequent performance, they should get several stars at least. 4 stars"
4,Great movies...medocre extras,"These two movies deserve 5 stars....the package deserves 3. (An average of 4). You already know about the movies and the sweet suffering of pain and all that. Let me tell about the package. It's a little disappointing. First, it comes in this giant size tin. Inside the tin is NOT 2 individual keepcases (Which would have been preferable) but 1 CD jewel case with both DVDsin it. It does come with two cool 5 x 7 theatrical poster replicas and a 48 page booklet with behind the scenes. The DVD's do have some extras like trailers, commentary by Clive Barker and Ashley Laurence and writer Peter Atkins, widescreen and a featurette for each film. BUT no deleted scenes, which is very upsetting!!! They have them in the still gallery but why not have them in a deleted scenes format. That would have been great. All in all a good buy."
3,Hellraiser....get ready to be scared,"A modern horror classic in its own right, Hellraiser makes for a great night with popcorn and friends. The movie basically focuses on a device (a small rubbix cube box) which acts as a portal for good old pin head, a bad guy that basically kills people in the most gruesome ways. The movie has a flavor of 80's horror films which can never be replicated in the sea of CGI and computer special effects that exists nowadays. This Limited Tin set includes both the first and second installments on this great series for double the mayhem. As a collector's item it is a great purchase. As a horror classic you basically owe it to yourself to experience it if you haven't already. This is the perfect chance. Highly recommended."
2,I can't believe I wasted 3 hours of my life,"I don't get it. I've read the reviews on this site and I was looking for an incredible horror experience.Are you kidding me?Let's not discuss the third rate acting. This is a horror film. Let's talk about special effects. Close ups of flesh colored plastic being hooked. Plastic melting off a skeleton and being run backwards at high speed. Drooling costumes which leave slimey trails. This is gore? This is shocking? I ate dinner during this film!The plot is cute but a poor vehicle for the rest of the film. The cinobites or whatever die in awful Saturday morning cartoon graphics. Low budget is no excuse for bad special effects.If you want gore, get Dawn of the Dead. If you want low budget brilliance, see Dead Alive or the Evil Dead series. If you want to be scared, go to the theatre and watch the re-release of The Exorcist.If you want to waste your time and money, pick up Hellraiser."
4,A classic piece,"I must say that irregardless of future attempts to revive this series, only two of them wholly stand out. Of these, the original Hellraiser comes second. With the release of this limited tin, we get a few goodies, decent sound, excellent picture quality, and a very original screenplay. Yet, it does lose a little towards the end. One must remember, though, that this movie was made in the middle 80's, and truly pioneered some of the shock horror we have become accomodated to today. Hellraiser 2 picks up where the first lets off, and the first 30 minutes are truly awesome. The story is filled with moments that can lead us to a truly scary movie. But after that first 30 minutes is up, the movie goes to hell, both literally and storywise. I would recommend buying this tin if you want the extras both discs offer, but if that does not interest you, buy the first and Bloodline, then rent the rest and laugh."
5,One of my favorite authors - I wish she would write more!,"I've read both Bittersweet Country and Jenny's Mountain, which are rich with detail and unexpected plotlines. Both novels I read straight through... which is rare for me. I only wish Elaine Long would write more books, as she is a fine author. I don't agree with her books being categorized as ""Romance Novels"" -- they are about strong, contemporary women. I learned much about the life of a woman living in the western part of this country from her two books."
4,Genuine look at a young wife and mother and her struggles,"I read Jenny's Mountain first about 5 years ago. This book is very well written, with characters who are real and genuine, very believable. Any woman who has struggled through the early years of marriage and hardship can identify with Jenny in her own way."
3,"Good overview, but make sure it's what you need","It is definitely a good overview, but I think it's understandable why you might wind up wishing you'd bought the individual countries instead. My previous experience with Lonely Planet publications has been excellent; therefore, I may have set my expectations a little too high. There were a lot of major cities of interest and note missing from the France section and corresponding maps. This book is best for anyone who tries the ""21 countries in 30 days or less"" style of travelling. Personally, I depend on the Lonely Planet guides to help me stay a little off the beaten track at a leisurely pace and within my budget. I certainly credit their Costa Rica guide with keeping me safe, well-fed, and satisfied for a month! Do note, that I've come across accomodations listed which are no longer in existence or closed for longterm renovations, so phone ahead!"
2,Buy the country guides instead,This book provided at best a cursory overview of travelling in Western Europe. I ended up buying the individual Lonely Planet country guides for each country I travelled in. (These country guides were excellent.) The country guides provided the detail that I was looking for but was not available in the Western Europe Shoestring book.
2,Not Worth It,"This guidebook covers the countries of western Europe. However, it seems that Lonely Planet tried to cover too much in this guidebook, so most of the descriptions of sights are barely more than a few sentences and a phone number. It's better to think of this as a giant checklist of places you could visit while in Europe, but don't rely on this for any amount of information. If you're looking for travel and sightseeing information, it's better to get the individual country books for the countries that you are going to travel to. To tell the truth, I bought this because I'm planning a multi-country trip in Europe, so I was hoping that this would contain exstensive information about getting between countries by train, but I was really disappointed to find that the information on this was severely lacking. If you your looking for something like that, Thomas Cook's Europe by rail books are better. Save your money and buy something else."
4,Always great for the beaten path.,"I have always been a Lonely Planet fan, and Western Europe is no exception, after reading this guide doesnt it inspire you to be a travel writer? Theese people though, know what they are doing. Europe is easy territory to cover. There are no tough issues to research nor would one have any trouble listing many a good hotels in First world Europe. The task is to remain fresh and inspiring, in a land that has been traveled and written on for centuries, and Lonely planet suceeds in Europe again and again. Each country has an introductory section that explains the history and cultural differences. Then each author goes onto cover the main cities and tiny towns in down to earth indepth coverage. They provide thorough updates and night life coverage, tour listings and landmark sights. It simply is a must for one who plans a cross country European trip."
4,Superb & Essential,"I carried a copy of this book around on my Contiki trip in August of '96. Found it extremely helpful, if not essential. Gave fantastic overviews of all the countries I was to experience, covering all the travel topics that Lonely Planet are so well known for!Typical Lonely Planet superb standard. Could easily be considered as the 'Travelers Bible'."
4,nice crib for the money,"Received this crib as a gift and it is wonderful! Very stlyish without a hefty price tag. Very easy to put together and extremely stable. Never had a problem with the side not dropping down to get my son in or out. Like the fact that it converts. The only 2 problems I have are that the crib doesnot convert to a toddler bed it converts to a daybed. Not a big deal right? Just by a bed safety rail and attach it to the crib. NO, none that I have found are compatable to use with a crib. Also, the conversion into a full size bed.. I was not told an additional piece was required to convert this bed. Went to BRU and was told the conversion kit is 60.00. Not a big deal however, that makes the price of the crib upwards of 300.00. Most of the cribs in that price range come with conversion kit. All in all it is a good crib for the money."
3,Cute but inconvenient...,"I really like how this crib looks in my sons room, the design is great... my problem is it doesnt have a dropside, I didnt realize this until I had to start lowering the level because my baby kept getting taller. He is at the second lowest level right now, and putting him there when he is sleeping is a challenge, its either I lean all the way down and end up with a backache or basically just drop my baby in there. Please think about that before you purchase this crib."
4,Good crib,"When my husband an i were looking for a crib they were very pricey! this crib was cheap and the look we wanted. and usually you get what you pay for, if you know what i mean. and this crib is def. worth more than what we paid for! the only thing is that, yes, its hard to attach a mobile. we have one on, but its very lopsided! and i'm SHORT.. so for me to put the baby in it, i had to get on my tip toes.. then when the bed was lowered it was very hard to reach the bed w/o the baby waking up! those are about the only two cons to the bed.. other wise, i love it.. it has the looks and its cheaper than all the other ones that look like it!"
2,Quality was disappointing,"Although we liked the look of the crib in the store, the one we received in the mail was of less quality. I was upset that the front of the crib had these jagged holes where the screws fit into. These holes were not smoothed out as they were on the store version. Rather there were these splinter-like edges that needed wood plugs, which the manufacturer refused to supply as they thought it to be a safety hazard. A BIG ALSO, if you want one of those musical crib toys, the edges of this crib are too wide to fit the toys properly and you will end up placing it either somewhere where the baby can hardly see it or where the baby can bump into it once he or she starts rolling around."
1,Very Dangerous Crib - Should be Recalled,"My 15 month old son's leg has gotten caught in the side rails (between the spindels). Very painful and hard to remove his leg. I just called the manufacturer and they said they have had three other complaints for the same thing. They warned that if I use a netting to close up the space, that the baby may be caught in the netting which can be dangerous. They did not give me any other solution but to make it into the toddler bed which I feel is a little too early for his age. Very disappointed."
3,"Watchable, but not a classic","There is a great story here with a huge assortment of characters each brought togeather by greed, betrayal, evil schemes and honor. There is a who's who of the top Japanese actors at the time. The pieces are all there, but they are not brought togeather in a classically dramatic way. There should be bunches of deliciously enjoyable confrontations here (verbal and physical), but the scenes do not reach these heights. The cinematography and direction seem like a common TV show...not approaching a finely crafted film level. This film is watchable, the story insures that, but it isn't a classic."
4,An actually intersting film.,This is one of those Sonny Chiba films that I actually thought were intersting and not cheesy funny. It makes you think and it makes you question on what really happened to the prince. WATCH THIS FILM!
5,One Of The Few Good Power Metal Albums,"Wow, this album is real good.It's fast,the riffs are good and the solos are awesome.The vocals are much better on this album then Where Mankind Fails,this album being their second release.Fall Into Madness is my favorite song on the album,it's fast,the riffs are good and the solo rules,everything you could ask for in a power metal song.When I get power metal albums I get the ones that are different.Wings Of Faith is awesome,the end of the song is amazing,it has the best part out of any of the songs on this album.This is a good fast power metal album."
5,A good book,"This romance also has a good story. The majority of romances, I find, do not.Ms. Campbell is a gifted writer. Enjoyed this one! Sit in comfy chair with hot coffee and read about Beth and her sister.Oh, no! A train wreck? Beth and her sister are on board? Who survives?"
1,(shrug),"i've been watching his pbs specials whenever i see that they are on. i fully expect that this review will register as ""not useful"", but take a second and really REALLY think about what this message. for me, dr. dwyer's lectures are frustratingly superficial. any time you try sitting on a cloud, you're going to hit the ground. hard. i look at the audience and everyone there just wants to be inspired. i don't blame anyone for wanting that. but there's some deep stuff out there, and i don't feel like this program registers."
4,sure,"this guy is very entertaining. AND he made me cry. hehehe. i think he is a great storyteller. he will captivate you! check it out for yourself.oh, I forgot to add- this guy is CRAZY. don't actually take what he says seriously or anything. he isn't even Tom Cruise Crazy. he's Michael Jackson crazy. but other than that his books are quite enjoyable for entertaining yourself. ENJOY!"
1,This book sucks,"Dyer does not to seem to have any idea what inspiration is, the only thing this book ""inspired"" me to do was throw up repeatedly. Besides how inspired can this guy be he has the number one selling book on amazon he acts like he is trying to help people but all you are doing by buying this book is helping him make more money. You would be better to spend the money on yourself this guy knows nothing and this book definitely lacks ""inspiration""."
5,Inspiration,"This book was my introduction to Dr. Wayne Dyer. I had seen him on PBS, though I didn't know it was him at the time. I had only heard about him in Richard Carlson's book ""Don't Sweat the Small Stuff."" This is a very good book. Reading the other people running it down surprised me. The prose is very well written and the ideas easy to understand no matter what level reader you may be. It is going to be great to see this one hit #1 on the New York Times."
2,Repetitive and Ego Driven,"Some good information, but could have been covered in about 30 pages. A few simple concepts which were repeated in too many ways...felt like a child being talked down to. Admittedly, this book comes from a more ""personal"" point of view than his others....The word ""I"" was overused to the tune of 8 times in a paragraph consisting of 4 sentences! I found myself hurrying through the last few chapters just to be finished with listening to this self-centered sermon any longer."
2,New Age Inspiration,"Although I have always admired Wayne Dyer, this book goes over the top in taking a new age stance towards inspiration. If you ascribe to a belief in reincarnation, then this book is for you. Personally, I find some of his reasoning based on reincarnation to be defective and essentially unbelievable. All in all, he does attempt to inspire the reader as always albeit in a questionable manner on some levels."
3,Inspiration,"Inspiration is an OK book, considering it's by one of the top authors on this topic. He talks about himself and his own experiences too much."
5,Blessing,"Whoever is looking freedom, piece and joy I their lives, this is a awesome book fill with so much wisdom, I recommended to everyone ."
2,Blah Blah Blah Blah,I once again gave wayne dyer a chance and again I try not to sleep as he drones on about magical formulas....and WAYNE WAYNE WAYNE WAYNE.......Wayne did this Wayne did that...sorry wayne no more Dollars from me..........
1,A penny for his thoughts?,"It's perhaps no coincidence that dozens of sellers have decided this book is worth exactly one cent. (Since Amazon charges sellers $.99 + 15% for each book sold, people are actually PAYING Amazon $1 to have someone else take the book off their hands. )"
5,Dr. Wayne W. Dyer Inspiration,"I can not give a high enough recommendation for the contents of this CD.I listen to it in the car all the time and the more I listen the more I getout of it.I highly recommend it to anyone that needs to understand the value of life,get out of the rut of the negative world we sometimes live in and trulybe inspired.Little bummed the second disc has to be inserted a couple times to play, but once itdoes read it is fine. I thought it was my player but it has no problem with otherdisc's so probably just this cd has a blurb in it? Didn't want to deal with returnand wait for a new one so just dealing with it. This is the one problem you havewhen buying on line."
5,Inspiration,I am still enjoying this book. I have many of Dr. Dyers book and audio's and I have gotten a lot of great advice for my whole family from studying and apply the ideas in this book. As always his books are easy to understand and full of many thought inspiring word .
4,"Great idea, tougher read","Dyer's a fascinating guy dealing with an compelling, if abstract, subject, and thus, one difficult to express. Book's a stimulating concept, but in many places, his writing/editing could be tighter, crisper. Still, purchased this copy used and have no regrets; it arrived in four or five days, near-mint condition. Good book; good purchase; good service."
2,Inspiration by Wayne Dyer,Not a great read. I love this type of book and it was not at all easy to follow. At the end of each chapter there were listings of things to do in your life or to try. Those listings were helpful. But wading through the verbage to get to them was very tedious. I recommend it on audio. Maybe that would help. Maybe.
1,"Oh well, so much for reason....","I have been a fan of Wayne Dyer for some time. Always found his books positive and somewhat Toa in nature. Promoting that we are in charge of our destiny - grasp it and move forward. His writings provided actionable plans. BUT, in this book, Dyer proclaims his belief in Creative Design and speaks of his own ""past lives"" discoverd under hypnosis and the like. Speaks of meeting with god to chat about what purpose our spirit will have when we take human form. For those of us that are not religious, this is quite hard to stomach. Suppose this should be a big hit in Kansas. :("
4,Awe inspiring,"What a wonderful soul inspiring book. It perpetuates the tenacity and perserverance that is part of the woman in all of us. The book, Purposefully Made by I. Fountaine Allen is also a must read."
5,amazing,I had already listened to the audio cd's several times before buying the book! It's my favorite of all Dr. Dyer's books and it's so relevant in my life now as I launch new projects! Thank you for your always inspirational guidance.
4,inSPIRITation is an ultiMATE companion for life,"I personally do keep up with what he writes and his talk show on Hayhouse radio. And I do think this is one of his best latest books.This book I think is great for breathing life into an uninspired life or even enthusing a bit of spirit into an already fruitful life.You should buy this book if you want a pick-me-up in your life. I use to read it on my lunch break and it was a good little motivational tool to keep me living in spirit whilst at work :)Its about returning to your source, the universal oneness that we all belong to. And what better person to walk with you their than Wayne. His words really do come through our God, and this book one way or another will touch you and will change you for the better."
3,Nice to listen to...,"Dr. Dyer is truly fun to listen to. He's inspirational and I believe he means what he says. These CDs are an example of his seminar type lectures, but taken from a more personal standpoint. I enjoyed listening to them, but didn't find the 'how to' part of it particularly easy to follow. A lot of platitudes are thrown out there as suggestions, but I guess the subject doesn't lend itself to a specific roadmap. If you're listening for inspiration - great. If you're looking for some revelation as to 'how to become like Wayne Dyer,' you may be disappointed."
3,"Wasn't one of his better books, lots of rehash.","This book shows that perhaps Wayne Dyer is running out of new things to say. Most of what is found in this book repeats messages from previous books. Not a horrible book, but just not up par. You would be better off reading another one of his books. I say skip this one. Although in his defense, how many times can you says that we are all one with God, manifest, and put out good vibrations to attract like."
3,"A quick read, nothing new","I bought the Kindle version of this book. Nothing really new in this book, a fairly quick read. If you've read any of the more extensive Beatle books you can skip this one. If not it may be worth it if you're looking for a fast, brief reference. But there is much more info in the better bios out there. I gave this an ""O.K."" rating."
1,Let It Be,"If you have never really read anything about the Beatles, you might find this book worthwhile. But if the information is news to you, then you probably aren't that interested in the Beatles in the first place. There are some quality books about the boys on the market. This is not one of them."
3,How Useful Is It?,"How useful the ""Fruit Expert"" is depends on where you live. If you're English, this is probably a fine book for you; if you live in the States ... keep looking. I wish I had known this before I bought it; I wish Amazon would give the publisher's city for all their garden books."
5,Even better than his first,'Have you seen' so far is my favorite album of 2006. its really refreshing to hear rampage again since i havent listened to much rap in the past few years. i hope it gets more exposure than 'scouts honor'did.Fav tracks 1. Ball All Day 2. Freeze 3. Goin Outta Business 4. Hold Up 5. No Love in the room
2,Very Disappointed,"I have been a big Rampage fan for years, first off... His first album"" Last Boy Scout"" was hot, the beats, lyrics, everything... The beats on ""Have You Seen?"" are in my opinion ""terrible"" which really makes you not wanna hear what Rampage is talking about... Don't get me wrong, Rampage is still an excellent MC. But the beats seems a bit clubish... I was looking more so for that hard s#*% like his first album.. Hopefully the next album will be much better... I gave it two stars because I'm glad Rampage is still on the scene ***** May Hip Hop live on and on *****"
3,Rampage is Rough,"This CD is iight, but I was looking for a lil' something harder from the General of Flipmode. He held it on his own and beats were decent, but it has potential."
1,My face was falling apart,"I know a lot of people are happy with this product. That is why I bought it in the first place. Unfortunately, this product almost made my face fall apart. It covered my face with terrible acne and I have been dealing with it for over a year. I still have acne scars.I did not know that a product could change my life this badly. Maybe it is just me, I do not know. Just be careful."
4,Works after 15-20 days,The stuff works no doubt. I used it once a day and noticed my freckles lightening up after about 15 days of use. I surfed WAY too much when I was younger and got lots of sun spots due to a lack of sunscreen.This stuff lightens them up for sure.Is it bad for you? Maybe.... but so is doing too much of ANYTHING... as well as drinking too much water. so meh..
2,Not too sure,"I'm not too sure if this product works. After a few days of use (once a day), i broke out in areas where applied and it was very drying."
4,Skin looks good,"I don't have any particular scars but I wanted my skin tone to even out so I didn't have to bother with makeup. This stuff doesn't smell great nor is the texture wonderful but I do like the way my skin looks. I usually wear it at night and in the morning I use a Vita C lotion (which smells and feels great) and a simple face lotion with sunscreen. This doesn't make me break out and isn't drying. I am a lucky adult with acne so some lotions are trouble. I also have the skin tone evening face mask by palmers, which I notice more impact from than the face cream. My skin always looks fantastic after I use it."
5,Excellent,"This is the best fade cream I've used especially for my very oily skin. It actually does what it says, clears, evens skintone in approx. 6-8 weeks with continued use 2x daily. I have received so many compliments."
5,Espisocpal Consecrations,"Angelus Press translated this book from the French in 1995. The Rev. Fr. Pivert has studied law and jurisprudence, specializing in questions of Catholic Church's Law. He explains the subject so that the layman may understand it.This book should be read by all the faithful. I have heard the word Schism used as lately as last Sunday in a Chapel Newsletter when talking about Traditional Churches in general, and in reference to Archbishop Lefebvre from the mid 1970's all through the 1980's. This book takes you step by step through all the points of contention and law. And shows' how there is not now, nor ever has been a Schism between the Traditionalist and with Rome.In support of his position he uses both the 1917 and 1983 Codes of Canon Law to make his case. In addition he shows how the continuation of the Episcopacy is an unchangeable law of the church. After reading this I can see that the word Schism should never have even been uttered."
4,Great cookbook for one or two people,"This is a great cookbook. Lots of great recipes, broken up into breakfast, beef/pork, chicken/turkey, seafood, vegetarian, and dessert sections. It is not a huge cookbook, but has lots of variety. The recipes do not require too many ingredients and no hard-to-find ingredients like some other cookbooks. The recipes also have low fat or fast labels (or both) on them. This cookbook also has many pictures and nutritional breakdowns for every recipe. The only thing I do not like about this cookbook is some recipes often require lots of pots and pans and sometimes too many things going on at once (but I'm a beginner cook though). However, with practice, I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. I've made about 10 recipes so far and loved every one! There was no review of this book when I bought it, so I was a little nervous, but very impressed!"
4,Great recipes!!!,I bought this for newlyweds and I thought the recipes were wonderful. I copied some of them for myself.
5,great book for beginner,"I got this book as a gift, when it was new on the market. I have loved it evr since. The recipes are delicious and the directions are so clear as to make everything in the book perfect. This book is especially good for beginners, young cooks, and single people, for when cooking for yourself is tiresome. I thoroughly enjoy this book and I heartily endorse it."
2,bjp123,"This was another cookbook I made the mistake in purchasing in haste. Once again, I did not find very many recipes I liked although this book turned out to be better than the Betty Crocker ""Just the Two of Us"". I guess it doesn't help when you don't like fish or very many vegetables to begin with."
2,Mediocre Thriller,"This was the second book I read by Richard Hoyt and it just confirmed my impression of him as a rather mediocre hack author of Cold War spy thrillers. Where ""Trotsky's Run"" featured an American politician and KGB sleeper agent who thought he was the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky, ""The Manna Enzyme"" starred Fidel Castro himself. Unfortunately, the amusing premise of a middle-aged, overweight and clean shaven (!) Fidel going on a covert operation in the rural byways of Ronald Reagan's America is wasted in a standard-issue, Cold War, anti-left plot. Hoyt's grip on politics is pretty pedestrian and, if memory serves, he seemed much more interested in Castro's youthful tryout with the New York Yankees.I was smiling writing the description above, but in remembering the actual experience of reading the book, I just honestly can't recommend it, no matter whether you're a leftist like me or a rock-ribbed, free-marketeer capitalist. It's just not that good a read."
4,A pleasure to use everyday,I count calories and I use this scale everyday. It seems pretty accurate. It's retro styling looks great in my vintage kitchen. The only complaint I have is the ounces start over with each pound which makes it annoying when something is over one pound.
3,ALL FOR NOTHING,"I AM NOT HAPPY THAT I HAD TO WAIT A MONTH TO GET THE ITEM PURCHASED.I LOVE THIS ARTIST AND I KNOW THAT THIS COLLECTION IS NOT AUTHENTIC. THE SONGS DRAG, SO THE SONGS RUN SLOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL VERSION. I JUST DON'T THINK I WILL BE USING AMAZON FOR MAKING PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE. I CHECKED 3 STARS BECAUSE I STILL LOVE THE ARTIST, BUT HONESTLY 3 STARS IS TO MANY FOR THE SERVICE I THE PRODUCT 2GETHER."
4,Step-by-step Herbs a good Primer,"This is a good starter for the home herb gardener with information for both large and small gardens. Included is a good herb encyclopedia which includes information on size, when to plant, uses from cosemtic to medicinal to foods but most important of all, soil, light and climate requirements. As with most BH&G books, the pictures are a balance of beauty and those of a more practical step-by-step nature. The book is filled with helpful hints such as those for planting but controlling invasive plants such as mint. I could have used that information at our first house! The information is helpful, but I found myself wishing for a bit more information and deatail for specific herbs, perhaps because I am a new home herb gardener. However, I feel that I will use the book and enjoy the photos and ideas as well."
