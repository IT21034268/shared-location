5,Home owner,"I recently purchased this saw, not from this website because they were not in stock at the time. I recently used this unit to cut some stringers and steps for some basement stairs. I have been putting off several projects because the power saw I have is a basic home owner Sears unit useful for light work but I would not like to use it for any heavy work...I am very glad I made the investment in this saw. I feel very confident in its overall construction and it just feels good to use this product."
4,Good Condition,"This book came is pretty good condition. The actual novel inside has 0 markings or underlining but the outside cover is a little crappy, but who cares!"
1,Doesn't work like it says!!!,"I got and it won't read my microSD using my adapter, which it clearly says it will on the box. It's a great idea if it would only work."
2,Doesn't mount,"When I put it in my MacBook Pro, the SD card doesn't mount. Sometimes Disk Utility will ask me to initialize it and format the drive, but it stalls. Then the camera asks me to format it too. Maybe it's just a bad one, but I'm going to have to return this."
3,works almost perfect,For me this was just what I was looking for. The only problem I'm having is that it doesnt work with microsd. If I use the adapter for microusb it doesnt work. Behalf of that its an exelent product.
5,perfect,works perfectly. you can hardly notice it and there no sleep issues on a macbook pro for me.
2,Works... for memory cards with low capacities,"It works well, but no where on the product packaging did it say that the high capacity SD cards were compatible with it. I assumed it would, but it doesn't. So cards with 1 GB or higher capacity won't work. Fortunately I could get by with 512 MB cards...One positive point is that drivers or installation software is not needed on Mac OSX Tiger or Leopard."
4,"Works fine, but not SDHC compatible","This worked flawlessly in my MacBook Pro, but beware it is NOT SDHC compatible, so you will not be able to work with large capacity SDs. The product preceeds the new standard, so do not blame them. So although it works well , I do not advise to buy any SD reader which is not SDHC. It is just not worth, since the most economic chips are now 8Gb in size. Wait for a new model, and get along with a cheat USB adapter until then."
3,"Okay, but not the originals...","I wish Disney would just stick to what works. Why didn't they just include the original versions of thes songs with and without the vocals. Beats me. This CD contains a lot of great songs, but they are not the originals. Also the orchestrations are childish and empty - they are not even close to the richness of the originals.Overall an okay buy. I still don't understand why they couldn't include the originals. Go figure."
3,For the most part...,"I personally think that this CD is overall very good. It has a good variety of fun songs from lots of Disney's best movies. The few things that I didn't enjoy quite as much were the fact that some of the songs were in ranges that didn't fit many singing types, and seemed only based to fit the singer's voice on the example tracks. Some of the songs were also shortened a bit. But my opinion is that it's a great opportunity to listen to the strengths of your voice and start to record yourself, or just have fun. And if you don't like it, just send it back. Hope this helped!"
1,"Perfect Gift,if you are into Karaoke,of course.","My neice love's disney. I thought this would be the perfect gift. How much better can you do than Disney+Karaoke. Well, come to find out she wanted a Ukelele. This is not a Ukelele. Email me if you know of any Disney Ukeleles."
4,PDD by Eppinger/Ulrich,"I'm taking this course at MIT taught by Eppinger, and it provides a good quantitative approach to a process that's otherwise very organic and unpredictable. Direct cause and effect approach."
3,"Is OK, but there are better options.","I have the pleasure of taking a seminar with the author, but I was disappointed at his writing. The book is hard to follow, and lack structure."
3,It's true what they say -- I got what I paid for,"Bought from merchant 'sophiaglobal' for $15, which is a great price *if* the product is equivalent. The quality of printing was fine. The cartridges themselves are unbranded and bubble-wrapped, not packaged as shown on the Amazon product page. I can't say they contained half the ink of an HP-branded cartridge, but they certainly didn't last as long. I was disappointed, and won't be purchasing any more ""refurbished"" ink cartridges from this or any other merchant."
3,Not bad cartridges; the free paper pack deal is excellent.,"I would rather they just sold these single; it takes me forever to use one cartridge (around a year) so having to buy two wasn't a deal for me.I did send away for the free paper pack and it came with a lot of things: envelopes, photo paper, card paper, etc. I'm not sure it's $20 worth of paper but its interesting."
1,A joke,"This item is misrepresented to be an interactive CD with 101 questions. Well, needless to say it is a PDF file! haha this is such a joke, so basically it now has to be printed out to be of any use at all. The total cost of this item was $10 with shipping, it was not worth 50 cents."
4,The Seeds of Time,"`The Seeds of Time' is a collection of short stories from John Wyndham and features many stories about both time and space travel. Some are longer, and some are better, than others but they all manage to grab your interest within the first few paragraphs and keep you hooked until the end. Some of the ideas and concepts really give you something to mull over and I often thought about them days after I had finished the book. If you are new to Wyndham then this is a good place to get a feel for his style, but you will soon want to get your hands on his other novels, which are just as well written as this. All in all this is perfect to dip into at odd moments and offers up some excellent science fiction story telling at it's best.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
2,Basic and sometimes interesting,A nice little essay on SF cinema that doesn't feel that structured. Lots of nice trivia but the author is quite taken by Star Wars to the detriment of previous SF movies. The only memorable moment is where the writer starts slagging off John Boorman's Zardoz (a film I feel is a under-rated gem). Something to give your little brother to shut him up on a very long car trip.
3,Literature Is About Itself and A Dream,"Reduced to essentials, Literature (with a capital ""L""), Northrup Frye says, is about itself, a wish fulfillment dream, and it's also an anxiety dream. This news ought to knock no one's socks off. Living in a post-Freudian world, one wonders why this book is still regarded as significant, except in the littlest way. Reading this book for the first time in 1991, decades after leaving graduate school where this book was required reading, I was completely underwhelmed. ""Is that all there is?"" was my only response. Yes, that is all there is.156 pages."
3,From a Student's perspective...,"Very insightful. I know he meant to make this an informal style, but it's confusing. He keeps going back and forth, here and there, but he ultimately makes 1-2 good points in each essay. However, the one or two interesting point he makes in each essay really tickles your mind. Very philosophical....but..not recommended for those who thrive on fiction."
5,the best is back!!!,"I owned these boxer briefs when they were originally sold years ago. I looked and looked when they discontinued them and never found anything that even came close. So when Amazon listed these again, I bought 10 pair! The fit is perfect to the size listed, they keep everything in place without being too tight or too loose.I never take the time out to write a review but these are worth it. I want Calvin Klein to keep making these forever so I hope others buy then and ""see the light."""
4,NAME CHANGE,"THE ONLY SUGGESTION I HAVE IS IF THE NAME OF THE PRODUCT HAS CHANGED THE SELLER SHOULD NOTIFY THE BUYER. I BOUGHT GRIPPER JAM UNDERWEAR AND THEY CAME AS CYCLE SHORTS. I HAD TO INVESTUGATE THE WEB TO FIND THE NAME CHANGE. I WAS CONSIDERING RETURNING ITEM HAD I NOT FOUND THE INFORMATION I WAS LOOKING FOR, VERY TIME CONSUMING AND UNNECCESSARY IF THEY HAD JUST STATED IN PACKING THE NAME CHANGE"
1,calvinklein gripper jams,Very dissatisfied with product. They are cut very short in the rise and if one has a belly of any size they will not stay up.
4,Very Cute,"My two older sons were being ninjas and I searched high and low for a ""baby ninja costume"". It wasn't the best material but served it's purpose. He was the hit of the neighborhood with his little headband. It really was cute!"
5,Great little book!,"This was given to me by a friend five years ago, and I keep coming back to to look at old favorites and learn new ones. The occasion today is that I want to order a copy to give to someone else. When you get this, check out ""sonnet entitled how to run the world""... it's the best, although requires several readings. And know that despite all of the wierd punctuation, cummings' poems do work well when read aloud."
5,Great introduction to e. e. cummings,"e. e. cummings is one of my favorite poets, and this collection of his poems is a treat for any fan of his verse. The innovativeness of his language and the freshness of his images are continuously inspiring. It is sometimes hard to believe that most of these poems have been written well over half a century ago - they have all aged remarkably well. This is a testament to the simplicity and the permanence of the themes and ideas that e. e. cummings dealt with, and the original and inimitable way that he approached them. And if you are not already familiar with e. e. cummins' writings, this collection is one of the best places to start getting to know this great American poet."
5,Great Selection,"My old paperback from the '70s dog-eared and falling apart, finally died, so I replaced it with this copy, absolutely the same except for the cover. This is a great cross section of cummings' workand wonderful to read time and time again."
3,I carry you in my heart,"The book is what it is, I'm just sad a great poem like I carry you in my heart did not make the shortlist to be put in the book, while it's one of his most famous poems."
5,"a critc knows the way, but can't drive the goddamn car..","i don't know why so many people hate e.e. cummings. is it because he was so unconventional or because he didn't want his poetry placed in a box ? i'd have to say that he and amiri baraka are the two poets who have deeply influenced my work. his insanity with wordplay and the music of his language is stunning. "" somewhere my eyes have never travelled "" is one of the coolest love poems i've ever read. and cummings love poetry is equal to neruda's in passion. buy this book and fall asleep reading it..."
5,Start Here,"You may have heard of this infamous poet - or even read one or two of his pieces so frequently called ""avant garde."" His imagery is startling and perhaps his greatest gift was his ability to make those images musical, as though they roll off the soul. If you've wanted to get a taste of Cummings and didn't know where to start, this is an affordable collection of some favorites. Well worth the inexpensive price - compact but filled with the choicest selections."
4,A great starting point,"I am just now rediscovering poetry. I've always enjoyed it as a teenager, so I bought three books by word-of-mouth this year. I can't say this one was my favorite, but it is a classic! I am sure the effect of Cummings at the time was great, but I strongly suggest that readers take in the writers of our day. This book is a great starting point, but it only gives you a history of what's going on with more contemporary poets."
4,Very Nice Illustrations,The Illustrations were the best part of this text book. Since it was a required text for a coaching license the illustrations made understanding the material much easier.Structure & Function of the Body - Soft Cover Version (STRUCTURE & FUNCTION OF THE BODY)
1,Structure and Function of the Body,Be careful. I ended up with the study guide and not the book that I had intended to buy. Be sure you have checked the names of both authors as Thibideau is listed as author but the study guide is written by Linda Swisher...
1,"Watchout! Deceptive trick. Is only the ""Study Guide""","This is not the book. All you will get is a bunch of worksheets and crossword puzzles that go with the book titled ""Structure and Function of the Body""."
5,Brief Therapy,"Another seamless transaction, good customer service and quick shipping despite the holiday season. Great book and an easy read with some really practical information."
4,What's really strange ...,"... Is that it's a Will Ferrell movie, and it's actually good!I've never been a fan of ""Saturday Night Life,"" or any of its recent escapees. I've drank no Kool-Aid there. But Ferrell's Harold Krick shows a level of intelligence and maturity you'd never expect him to have. He's not some crass, overgrown child pretending to be a grown-up. He is a grown-up. A real, sympathetic, and still serious role.Krick lives a controlled, but drab life as an IRS auditor. Until one day he hears a narration voice in his head. He discovers he's a character in a novel, one which will eventually kill him. Emma Thompson is the neuorotic author Kay Eiffel and Queen Latifah is her somewhat protective assistant. Added into the mix are a delightful Dustin Hoffman, and a less delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal. All still put on a tremendous effort. I also enjoyed the continual phantom numbers and calculations, interesting touch."
3,Not quite strange enough,"What might have been just another high-concept trash comedy of the Adam Sandler variety - beige nobody discovers he's the central character in someone else's novel - thankfully becomes, in the hands of a great cast and skilful crew, something more. Zach Helm's screenplay doesn't have the Charlie Kaufman-style weirdness or complexity the premise deserves, nor the intellectual savvy of an ""I Heart Huckabees"", but as a tilt at the themes of mortality and meaning it's a worthy, if slightly too cutesy, piece."
4,Great Cast-Good Movie,"Stranger Than Fiction brings to the screen the unusual story of a very ""usual"" kind of guy. An IRS agent living a rather uninteresting life for the last 12 years begins hearing a woman's voice narrating his life. It turns out he might be right...The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.Will Ferrell, Maggie Gyllenhaal (who is GORGEOUS!), Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, carry out their respective roles very well.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good.In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment."
5,Stranger Than Life,"Stranger Than Fiction is a pretty good movei. I thought it was will ferell's most non rediculous and insane films. It actually had a good plot to it. and a good story a unique one. This movie is about a man who can hear his life being narrated by a woman. He dosen't know how it's happening but he has to find out before it's to late, because this woman is a novelist and in all her novels she kills the main character. what she don't know is that her main Character Harold Crick(Ferell) is real. What's going to happen well find out go rent the movie."
4,Quirky,"This was an entertaining movie. Strange plot, a dweebie tax guy is the focus of a novel, and can hear the narrator describing his life. Starts out slow, but as he meets this entertaining baker that he's auditing, things get interesting. She wrote some crazy letter to the IRS explaining why she would only pay a percent of what she owed. So, of course, she got audited, and opened up his eyes to the life going on around him.His interactions with Dustin Hoffman, a college lit professor, who sort of becomes his shrink, is interesting. Hoffman is trying to find out where the novel is going, tragedy or comedy? There are some holes and weaknesses, which is why I didn't give it a five star review. But five star movies really are few and far between. I enjoyed it, and recommend it to my friends."
4,Excellent,"Truly enjoyable movie. Thompson creates yet another memorable character. She truly excells at portraying cynical characters. Gyllenhaal's character, although not as memorable, was well portrayed. Huffman was excellent as well. And Ferrell, well, it was good. His expressions' portraying a lost sad man living a completely uneventul life won me over. The movie, as opposed to its characters, refused to fall into cynicism. It is intersting to note that the most cynic of the characters goes outside of her own self involvement to write a ""good but not great ending""."
5,I did not want to see this film!,"I was taken to see this film almost against my will. I'm not sure why that is, but I'm glad I saw it. I'm amazed that this film wasn't more popular. It's beautifully written and is an incredible breath of fresh air for Hollywood that seems to be spending most of it's time pairing stars to do remakes of 80s TV shows or other movies. This movie is funny in a subtle way but also inspirational. I think I'd like to be buried with a copy."
5,I totally love this movie,"This movie made me a Will Ferrell fan for life. The rest of the cast is great, too. Such an interesting script. Just so unique, and so well done. I bought it, and watch it quite often. Fantastic film."
5,Excellent Movie,This is one of my favourite movies of all time.The story is amazing and the acting is excellent.
3,RICKY BOBBY GETS SERIOUS,"Will Ferrell joins fellow comedians like Robin Williams and Jim Carrey in assuming a more serious, downplayed character. He's Harold Crick, a really boring IRS auditor, who discovers he hears a woman's voice narrating his daily actions. And he hears that he's going to die. Seems the woman is writer Emma Thompson who is known for killing off all of her heroes. Thompson is displayed as a neurotic, tense workaholic who chain smokes and spouts meaningless philosophies. Dustin Hoffman shows up as a professor who tries to help Ferrell deal with his dilemma. Maggie Gynlenhaal plays a baker who Ferrell is auditing and ultimately falls for. The whole thing has an interesting premise but I didn't like the fact that there's never any explanation as to how this whole thing could really happen. The performances are overall good, with Gylenhaal and Thompson very effective. However, Queen Latifah's unusually lifeless performance as Thompson's aide is baffling."
3,Flawed DVD Production,"My opinion of this DVD is both the highest and lowest, which explains my medium star rating. On one hand, the movie is the best I have seen in several years. It is original, clever, and engaging. I loved it in the theater only.On the other hand, it simply won't play on my DVD player (Sony DVP-CX995V 400-disk changer). On my PC, the DVD launches the included ""Interactual"" player, but won't play in any other DVD application.This was true in two rental copies.Examination of the DVD file structure shows the usual, but at the disk's root directory, there is an Adobe/Macromedia Flash ""projector"" player file. I don't know if that's really the problem because the Pan's Labyrinth DVD seems to be designed the same way.Any thoughts?"
3,Love Gyllenhaal's Cookies,"After a very enjoyable first thirty minutes or so, I had a voice in MY head saying ""They'll never maintain this for an entire film"". And darn if that voice wasn't right. Gyllenhaal was the only actor to breath any life into her character. The scenes with Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah felt as colorless and bland as Thompson's apartment. Likewise, Ferrell and Hoffman's scenes were highly uneventful. I suppose Ferrell played his character about as well as could be expected considering the character was a simple guy who lived a very routine lifestyle, but he only seemed to shine while in the glow of Gyllenhaal's ever increasing star power."
3,Uhm...,"I was planning this to be a funny movie, because the main actor is only in comedy movies. I would suggest this to be rented but it wasn't good enough for me to buy and watch over and over again... There was a good plot, but I expected better."
2,"Farrel buys a guitar, and other slightly amusing scenes.","This film was one i have anticipated for a long time. Finally rented it, and once again will farrell failed to deliver. Should have come as no surprise considering his past work. Talladega nights was not funny. Anchorman was worse. I could go on, but i will spare you. I did enjoy this movie, mildly, however expected much more. The director's past films include ""Stay"", one of my recent favorites. This does not measure up. The ending left me without much thought. I derived no great message from this film. it did not move me in any way. The highlight involves the purchase of a guitar, and the performance of a song (one that i prayed when spoken of would be ""Fred's Slacks"", but was not). I think if stripped down, one could see the film for what it is. A two hour anti-tobacco commercial."
2,Boring and un-funny,I like these movies where a comedian decides he wants to stretch as an actor and try something different. Will Ferrell should stick to his goofy comedy movies because this movie was boring and pretty much was a snooze fest. I think it was an interesting and quirky concept but the finished product just didn't end up being that good.
2,"It's gotta get better soon, doesn't it?","The premise of the film was silly and that's what caught my eye. Well that and all the other reviews that said how wonderful it was.For me the film drug out and I kept hoping it was going to get better. The only reason I kept watching it is because I was curious on how it was going to end. Having seen the end I wish I hadn't. It was the end that irritated me the most, completely moronic. But I can't tell you about it or I would be ruining it for you. Hmm,,, maybe I should tell you. I'd be doing you a favor."
4,"Strange, and entertaining",We were entralled by the twists and turns of the story. A fun movie to watch. This is the only Will Ferrel movie that I have ever seen that he actually attempted to act.
5,interestingly different,"Stranger than Fiction was really good. I ended up having to buy it for 14.99$ because you can't rent it on here but ah well it was good so I don't care even though I am jobless I enjoyed my purchase. I have wanted to see this for awhile because Will Farrell is in it and I had the idea it was a comedy from the reviews and it was at times but just really really good and the ending is good too:):):):) I liked the premise of it, one I've never heard and it took me until Emma was in that interview in the Professors office to really be sure that she was a real person....I was confused, very confused about her ""reality"" Was she a real person???? I had no clue.....very good....I don't want to give it away.....anything because I'm not sure how people approach reviews....read them before or after so I will leave that be....but buy it......its worth it......"
2,Less than scintillating,"I am not a fan of movies in which the main character spends the whole film with a flat affect on his face, such as the one Will Ferrell wears here throughout. It gets a little dull. I grew antsy almost from the beginning here, when the storyline becomes apparent. Though seemingly original, I wasn't particularly entertained by it. Dustin Hoffman is again wasted, as he was in ""I Love Huckabees."" This is a supposed comedy, but there are no real laughs, perhaps just a smirk now and then. It's also a bit long. I had to pause it several times to get through it because it's just not that compelling."
2,Boring.,"I thought the concept of the plot was original and something refreshing but the movie itself was a drag. Something about Will Ferrell just irks me the wrong way. I don't think he's a good actor at all and I don't find his humor amusing. Also I don't believe this film was meant to be a comedy because it wasn't funny at all. Which is fine, it works more as a dramatic piece but the execution of it all was just all too dull for me."
5,Wonderful Film,"This is one of my favorite films ever. Every character is quirky and endearing. The movie's premise and how it plays out is gripping and kept me absorbed, so much so that I was literally holding my breath at the end to see how it would turn out. I've recommended this movie to everyone. The soundtrack also rocks. It's just a solid, lovely, wonderfully engaging film and Will Ferrell as a pure drama actor is magnificent."
5,Existentialism in reverse,"The 2nd best film of 2006. A comedy only insomuch as films like ""Being There"" and ""Being John Malkovitch"" are comedies. Brilliant script, story and perfs. from everyone. VERY nice perf. by Queen Latifah."
4,NOT a fan of Will,"I have never stomached any of his other movies. I find his style of comedic acting to be 100% STUPID!!! My 9 year old could make his comedy funny, but Will just looks like an idiot. That said, I liked him here! When he's playing the role of a regular Joe, he's likeable! I felt bad for him near the end!! When he's being real, he's good. When he's being funny, well, let's just say I'd rather hear knock knock jokes all day then see him do a comedy!!"
3,I dont' get it,"Just one question: What was the business with the watch? The only purpose I could see for it was that it saved Harold's life in the end, but other than that, what did it have to do with the plot?"
5,Great Experience,"The product I ordered came quickly and was in mint condition, still in the original packaging. It's sometimes hard to know what you will get when ordering on the internet, but this has been a great experience."
3,Definately Strange,"About half way through this movie, I was bored. But I wanted to see what happened. I am glad I watched the whole movie. Harold basically has no life outside of his job. The writers voice makes him a little crazy. So he goes to a literature professor to find out what story he is living. Then he decides to live his life the way he wants to and has some romance with Ann. They were not a believable couple to me. But I guess that is what makes it strange. Worth a rental. Emma Thompson was fabulous."
3,Voices from an English broad,"One of Will Ferrell's better efforts. But then again...it IS Will Ferrell.Notice the male shower scene. It seems that Will Ferrell MUST have some homo-orientedscene in every one of his movies. Apparently, the guy is as queer as a three dollar bill."
1,Terrible,"Maybe I saw a different movie because I thought this was one of the worst I have seen in a long time. I didn't get the love story, Ferrell and Gyllenhaal had no chemistry. Ferell wasn't even funny. I saw this movie with my husband and his parents. I was the only one who stayed awake."
4,Was a Christmas present but package contained no BluRay,I ordered this as a Christmas present when she went to watch it opened case and it was empty it appeared that the security label was cut and then the case re-shrink wrapped.. Amazon promptly sent a new one that came in perfect condition would have been 5 stars had i not gone thought the disappointment of my girlfriend not getting to watch it when she wanted to.
4,A movie almost too clever for its own good.,"Through most of the movie I kept thing that this had to be one incredibly boring book this author was writing. For the movie, the plot was about a character becoming aware of it's creator and trying to change the predestined course of his life-none of that was going into the author's ""book"". The ending is truely a toss up. It's either clever or a cop out. I think it's a little bit of both. Still an entertaining film."
4,Best feature length performance for Ferrell,"Ferrell has had a string of duds...'Taladega Nights', 'Anchorman', and 'Blades of Glory'. The arrogant, oblivious moron character works for about 10 minutes, but becomes annoying and boring in a feature length film. Ferrell's comedic presence is brilliant for a few minutes, and that's why he was so good on SNL.In 'Stranger Than Fiction', Ferrell breaks out of his normal role and turns out a wonderful performance. He is convincing in his role of an average Joe Nobody and genuinely becomes a character you want to root for. The storyline is creative and original. Overall a very good film."
5,"The Smart Way, Not the Easy Way","It would have been quite easy for these filmmakers to have allowed themselve to get bogged down with unnecessary causation. This is a brilliant story and character piece and throwing in a magic pen or typewriter would have been a waste of time and energy.As it is, the plot and audience is saved from a pointless chase piece that would result as people chase a magic object and presented with a brilliant film that is both reaffirming and enjoyable."
4,Surprisingly good,"I had limited expectations for a Will Ferrell movie but STF was well done. Ferrell demonstrates that he can actually act in a (semi) serious role. Some say that the movie isn't funny but I would suggest that the humor is just a bit more sophisticated than the typical Will Ferrell low-brow comedy. The concept of the movie is quirky but they pulled it off reasonably well. As for the ending...Others have slammed the movie of the ending, and I understand why, but you can kind of see the reason behind it. On the one hand, is does seem contrived and cliché but, on the other hand, I think that this choice of resolution does seem somewhat consistent with the larger theme of the movie. I do think the choice of ending was based on more than just cheap sentimentality.Overall, a recommended choice."
4,Really good film,"Will Ferrell had a good performance here, enjoyed the twists that the story provided. Despite my looking for flashes of Ricky Bobby, I really thought Will delivered a performance that will earn him additional 'serious' roles."
4,Dr. Suess type of movie,The movie was like watching a Dr. Suess movie for the first hour until he visits the actual writer of the book.This movie is woth the watching time .
4,An accidental viewing of an alternate reality.,"Believe it or not, this rental came to me my mistake; same title, different movie.When I first saw that it starred Will Farrel, I gritted my teeth. I hated every one of his movies. But I was intrigued, entranced, and totally sucked into the movie. I loved every actor's performance. The story went beyond fantasy and made such a far fetched story more tangible than hum drum reality. I loved the movie and totally expected the hero to die, as expected. The boffo ending had me smiling and looking for some kleenex.You can see what the film is about in the other reviews, and IMO, it really has more heart than The Truman Show. Go ahead and enjoy it, though you'll need milk and cookies."
5,Stranger than fiction..is a smash!,"This movie should be recognized as a classic! The storyline is genius they way it is set up. Will Ferrell delivers one of his best performances with this movie; living a simple routine life everyday is awakened by a surprise. He discovers that he doesn't make the choices throughout his life it is actually a author who narrates his every move. This isn't a boring film it offers comedy, romance, & so much more. This movie will keep you interested until the end. Grab a copy you won't be disappointed I promise."
3,Ehhhh.....,"I'm a huge fan of Will Ferrell. I also adore the work of Emma Thompson. To pair these two together had the potential to create one of the best comedies ever. Sadly, the writing on this flick was less than comedic. Will Ferrell's comic timing was dead on, and Maggie Gyllenhaal's appearance as his would-be love interest was perhaps the single most believable aspect of this movie, due to spectacular onscreen chemistry. The story, however, failed to deliver all that it promised in the previews. It's sad when the only funny moments in a comedy are those presented in the 30 second commercial advertising its release, but that is the case with this movie. As a writer, I had such high hopes for this flick. It was an interesting concept which flopped big time in the hands of a writer that stopped with the conception of the idea rather than seeing it through to development."
3,Not That Funny,"Two things lead me to believe that this movie would be funnier then it was. One, the fact that it starred Will Ferrell, though that can be blamed on my own assumptions, and two, the previews, which showed only the funny bits of the movie, and led me to believe that this was just a comedy.It's not a comedy, it's a dramedy. There's a romance between Will Ferrell's character, and a baker his auditing. There's also what seems to be Natasha Richardson's character.The movie drags by it's middle act, and the ending could be better."
2,Strange alright..,"Slow start, middle, and ending. I didn't realize that they had shown the one funny bit in the whole movie on the previews. Rather disappointing."
2,Disappointment,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT - considering the film stars Wil Ferrel and Dustin Hoffman. The plot revolves around a single IRS man who one days starts hearing a voice and realises she is an author who is writing a book which is actually his life, in all this he also falls for a chick he is doing a tax audit, but once he realises that the author is going to kill him off he goes about to try and stop it - no prizes for how it ends - the laughs are few and far between."
1,SONY MAKING NON-PLAYABLE DVD'S,"As did Mr. Bob Dobolina in his review, I got ZILCH when I attempted to play this dvd. Assuming it was a defective disc, I took it back to the video store and got another one. It wouldn't play either. I recently tried a third time with a third dvd. I'll be avoiding Sony dvd's as well as it seems their product has a design flaw. CONSUMER ALERT- SONY SELLING DEFECTIVE DVD's WITH DESIGN FLAWS="
1,What a snooze fest!,"I rented this movie last night and was so bored. But I kept watching in hopes that it would get better. It didn't.I rated this movie as a one star, but that is being far too generous. It would've only gotten half a star, if that were an option, but only because I was stupid enough to rent it.Harold should have been hit by the bus at the beginning of the movie to put me (and others who felt the same as myself) out of my/our misery.Will Ferrell is admitted not one of my favorite actors, but his talents were put to waste on this movie."
4,good movie,"I enjoy watching this movie, several times in the past year. It is always entertaining. It features a very low-key performance by Will Ferrell. If you are used to his over-the-top persona, you may be disappointed in this movie. I feel that Dustin Hoffman turns in a very admirable performance as well. I wish that they had cast someone besides Gyllenhaal, I have never cared for any of her performances, not that good as an actress. And she is the reason I give the movie only four stars instead of five."
5,Good movie,"Stranger The Fiction is a change. I don't know of any other movie like this. It has its funny points. I like the scenes with Maggie Gyllenhaal in it. I think her acting was great. I like her personalty in the movie. I'm not too crazy about Emma Thompson. She looks really bad in this movie. I know that is the way she is suppose to look, but I think she needs to grow her hair long again and throw out the lesbian look. She looked really nice in Junior."
4,about Will Ferrell,This is the only Will Ferrell movie I like.For all I know he's a great guy but I'm not his usual audience so this atypical movie found an atypical fan.Worth buying even if you've sworn to kill the next date/nephew/son/grandson who insists on subjecting you to any other Will Ferrell movies.
5,"My Doctor Said ""Get This CD""!!!",This CD is awesome. My doctor is teaching me healing through movement and breathing and she uses this CD as part of her healing modality. The imagery and movements this music evokes are incredibly healing!
4,Great for Home Schoolers,Marshall retells many of the stories of Britain in a way that makes them easy to remember and understand.
3,Illustrations are in black and white,"Just so you know, in the Yesterday's Classics edition, the illustrations are not in color. I thought it wouldn't matter, but after I received the book I saw the illustrations in color online and they are sooo much more lovely! I'm returning this one for an edition with color illustrations (the one from Phoenix Press).Aside from this, the YC edition is fine -- nice font size, easy to read."
2,Disappointed with Quality,"I found Our Island Story published by Wilder Publications to be poor quality. There is no table of contents, the chapters are not numbered, and there are no page breaks between chapters. Some chapter headings are the last line on a page while the chapter content starts on the next page. It also is missing chapters 111-114 of the original book. It is not what I consider professionally done. I try to be frugal in my book buying, but I would recommend spending the money for a higher quality book. It will save you frustration in the long run."
5,Wonderful stories,"We have been reading about one a week for over a year. My girls love these stories! One of our rabbits ended up with the name ""Boudacia"" after we read her story.At the beginning they might be more folklore than fact, but none the less they are wonderful. There are some great moral lessons to be learned from many of the stories.After I bought the Yesterday's Classics I found an old hardback with great color pictures. It cost a bit, but what a treasure!Highly recommend."
2,Product manufactured in China,45 degree cut was not in tolerence. Bearing was defective as received and had to be replaced. Product was not advertised as foreign made (China) which would have altered purchase decision.
1,CHECK SELLER DESCRIPTIONS! Most are expired,"It seems most of the sellers for this item are selling expired/old cartridges. Check the list of sellers and you can see their comments. There should be a separate amazon item listed for expired cartridges to weed them out from the legit new cartridges.I bought from BargainBound (the default seller at that time) and nowhere did I see anything about expiration date. Once I discovered it, they gladly took the item back. I just wish I had known beforehand."
5,ink just ink,"I needed it to print, it fits, it works, now I can print I am happy.You will be too....lol"
1,Doesn't work,Cartridge was completely inoperative. I need a replacement. The shippment took nearly a month but it was during Christmas Season.
1,HP 15 ink cartridge,This product did not work properly in my printer a HP PSC 950xi. I am waiting for a response to my request to return the four cartridges for a credit.
3,delivery problem,The price was good but I had to visit the post office twice to pick it up. It was so annoying.
1,Cartridge wrecked my printer,"My first two black 15 cartridges worked pretty well in my HP Deskjet 3820 then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing. I replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all. While repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested, the etch tore. When examing the inside of the printer, I found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage. The next new cartridge would not work either. $$ wasted. Tech support said to have the printer repaired -- ya sure (after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out). Printer repair would cost me more a new one."
1,Dissapointing,...I bought my printer some weeks ago and now I'm out of black ink!!Very soon I will have spent more money in ink cartridges than the cost of the printer.I'm dissapointed with HP. That didtn't happened with my old HP 692C.
1,Bate & Switch,"I ordered Original HP Ink Cartridges from Eforcity and, instead, received refilled cartridges. I do not appreciate that type of business and would never order anything from them again. Amazon (not the seller) immediately credited my credit card acct, & the seller did apologize, but that doesn't change the fact that they (the seller...not Amazon) tried to cheat me, and I don't deal with businesses that do business that way. Any way you spin this, it's CHEATING."
1,DEFECTIVE ITEM,I inserted this item in my computer printer and the printer would not recognize it. It has been stored in my desk drawer since it was purchased in the received packaging. I reinstalled the old cartridge and the printer recognized it.
1,Waste of Money,When the deal is too good..should have known better..stupid product could not print even one page....just sacrifice $ 30 and get a real one or invest in a new printer with cheaper ink....good luck!
1,HP 15 Black Ink Cartridge,I purchased the HP 15 Black Ink Cartridge (C6615DN) recently and printed 20 pages. It ran out of ink! It is now showing faded red. Is there any recourse for this defective product? I paid about $28 for it and it is useless. Any ideas?? Is Amazon responsible for a refund or a replacement?I appreciate any help.
5,HP inkjet black cartridge,It was cheaper to get this cartridge shipped from Amazon ($8.94) to my home than to go to the local Walgreens and fill the cartridge for $10+tax. Amazing! And it works great - in fact better than the original cartridge I had in there before.
4,great decision,I would highly recommend this product...you get it at a fraction of the price and get the same performance. Store-bought ink cartridges are a total ripoff...I am very happy I side-stepped the system
1,Inkusa HP 15 inkjet cartridges,I purchased a refurbrished HP 15 inkjet cartridge twin pack from Inkusa. The first cartridge was rejected because it was damaged. The other cartridge worked for a day and a half before the ink nozzle clogged and wouldn't print. Such a deal!Didn't try the HP 78 yet but perhaps picking up a replacement at ****** would be a good backup idea.
3,Have not used it yet,"I received this cartridge very quickly, but I haven't used it yet, so I can't really comment on the quality."
1,Terrible,"I bought one from a store, which didn't work, so I thought I'd try Amazon.com. Well the one I order from here didn't work, either. Rather than go through all the rigamarole, I just bought a new printer. I've had no luck with HP products. The printer I had bought this ink for did nothing buteat expensive cartridges--when it decided to actually work, that is. Save your money and get a better printer."
2,Hp 15 ink cartridge,Were not in original HP15 boxes. The boxes were white and blank. Leaves a little suspicion. Not sure they are HP15 The cartridge was funny looking.
1,Less filling,"What HP doesn't tell you about this ink cartridge is that it costs almost the same as their venerable 45 cartridge, but that one holds 41ml of ink, while this one only holds 25ml. So you would appear to get 1/3 less printing (and pages) per cartridge (for roughly the same price) with a printer that uses this cartridge, as opposed to if you bought a printer that used the 45 (you have no choice if you have a printer than needs the 15 cartridge, you've got to buy it to keep using the printer). I guess they have to make their money somehow!"
1,Did not work!!,"I bought 3 of these cartridges but none worked. I have an HP 750 that requires a number 15, but this cartridge made the printer respond with ""wrong cartridge."" I was not too happy. All three did the same thing."
5,"Great, just how it was described","Had no issues, Got what I wanted and fast! I would order from this store again.Thank you for your service."
5,"In my opinion, this book is theraputic","A teen foster / adoption lifebook is very important to the youth I work with. As the director of foster care agency, I find it important to get youth to look at the places they have been and remember the fun as well as the difficult times they have survived. The book has a strong flow, as the end sets them up for a hopeful future. The ""For when I am Famous"" book helps lead staff whom work with foster/ adoptive teens to find a starting point that allows the kids to document the sometimes long and painful history of multiple placements they have been in. As noted in the last few pages of the book, this it a type of time capsule for the future while allowing them to work through some old memories of the past while giving them hope for the future."
3,"One of these songs just doesn't belong here, & it's the best frickin' song on the album!","The last song, Marmalade, is a beautiful piano instrumental loop you might hear out of an antique music box; nothing like the electro-clash on the rest of the CD. Marmalade quietly screams to be used in a Hollywood movie, & on it's own, makes this CD highly collectible."
3,Calm before the storm,"The narration shifts back and forth between father and sonduring two world wars in the Alsace region. The book opens with oneof the narrators enduring life as a prisoner of war, with the sense of time having ceased to exist. The descriptions of literary life before WWI set up a vivid contrast with the account of a gas attack on the Russian front. A reader well versed in philosophy and history, or reading the original French text, will no doubt understand more of the implications in the dialogues. Read the preface carefully to get acclimated, but don't miss the unexpected developments of this novel."
4,really good cd,"Although some of his hits are not here, there are some fine original recordings: Gordon Lightfoot's""Early Morning Rain"" and ""Second Cup Of Coffee"" along with Joni Mitchell's ""Urge For Going"" and ""BothSides Now.""Of course, ""Abilene"" and ""A Rose And A Baby Ruth"" are the songs most identified as George Hamilton IVsongs, there are other really good songs on this cd-""Crystal Chandeliers"", ""Country Music In My Soul"",""Canadian Pacific"", ""Break My Mind"" and others.For the price, this is a really good piece of folk/pop/country music."
4,essentially....great!!,"This is a wonderful book for showing you how to do all the basic preparations that make cooking fun, delicious and successful. You can easily page back and forth to find the subjects that interest you. This is an essential reference book that is beautifully photographed, easy to follow, full of terrific information and covers a wide range of topics. Anyone who is striving to become a better cook, at home or professioonally will enjoy this book as a valuable asset."
4,It Will Cut The Wood,"I'm no professional when it comes to miter saws, but this one did the trick. I used it to cut hardwood floor planks and have no complaints. I also used ti the cut 3/4 rounds for the baseboards, again no complaints.The saw dust bag and design to catch the saw dust needs much improvement. More sawdust definitely ends up on the foor than in the bag."
5,outstanding miter saw,"Purchased a Bosch 3912 after reading the roducts reviews. Was going to purchase a Porter Cable, but afer the reviews and examining each saw the Bosch is the boss."
2,Great saw but don't buy it here,"This is a great little saw, for the money it is very hard to get more quality.Amazon is very slow to deliver this item. I waited almost three weeks for it to get here, with it being ""pending shipping"" for two weeks. I finally got fed up and bought one locally for a bit less than what it was selling for here."
3,Nice but be Carefull,"I have been looking at compound mitre saws to prepare for a purchase. Can't say I have actually used the Bosch, BUT, while playing with it in the store I noted that when you lock the bevel or the cut angles, the saw table ""flexes"" with respect to the saw. This means the ""worked piece"" moves relative to the blade. This will create a lot of ""finicky"" issues when using the saw. I decided to pass on the Bosch, even though it had many other fine features!"
5,Best Compound Miter Saw Available,"I looked at a lot of saws and was impressed with all the features for this price. It is a workhorse and was easy to get right to work. Blade is good, but recommend a 60T or better for finish work. The detents are very helpful in making quick miter cuts. Also, high fence is useful. Index on right hand side makes cuts accurate and quick. Next best was the DeWalt 705."
4,Bosch 3912,Well made - like better than Dewalt or Makita. Plenty of power. Easy to set up - made no adjustments. Love the right or left handed operation - old school. No laser but I'm old and doing workwork for 40+ yrs. - wouldn't use anyway. Use on Denali Stand - very versatile.
3,"A construction saw, not for cabinetmakers.","I was hoping the reviews would lead to the best fixed (not sliding) miter saw, I decided to buy the 3912. I no longer buy power tools over the internet, so I bought it at a local contractor tool supplier. This gives me the option of showing the salespeople the issues that I am having if I need to return it. While I was hoping that the saw would be accurate and true right out of the box, it was nearly that. Unfortunately for how good the miter stops were there was too much runout, blade wobble, 1/32"". I took it back and we tested two more 3912's all of which had the same problem. They told me to expect that from all saws in this price range. The arbor, the blade, I don't know. Haven't had the time to put a new blade, or do any crown work. So good luck if you expect to pull it out of the box and saw away."
5,Some hard to find songs,"We bought this CD set and had it shipped all the way to New Zealand - thats how hard it is to find some of these old classics, like ""Yankee Doodle"" and ""Home on the Range"". I was a bit worried that some of the songs might be recorded in squeaky cartoon character style, but they're all performed by Larry Grace and a childrens choir - so there is a consistent, very easy-listening style. Perhaps its a little ""folksy"" but its very appropriate for these old classics.My daughter has played these so much over the past two years that the cases are falling to bits. I bring it out at her birthday parties and the other parents are amazed to hear these old songs from their childhoods. Great for toddlers."
1,the book is deeply flawed,"When you read a book this poorly concieved and expressed, you wonder what keeps you reading--right to the end. Perhaps I was in search of the book's most laughable or most outrageous claim (and the book is chock-full of wild and ill-founded claims), or maybe I wanted to prove to myself that cultural criticism in the wrong hands is a harmful thing. Let me be specific: what the book encourages, even celebrates, is paranoia. It leaves the concept unquestioned; rather, it is just assumed that, since we live in a paranoid world, we should just celebrate our paranoia. How this translates beyond individual neurosis, into the political, is never explained, nor, surprisingly, is even the slightest attempt made to articulate the significance of paranoia as a psychic condition. The aporias in this book render it a vertiable swiss cheese: more air than substance."
1,a scam?,"This book purports to study the relation betwen epistemology and technology, but only manages to stutter a few inanities about postmodern skepticism and the information age. Neither well researched nor well written, Aliens in America fails to illustrate the phenomena in question in ways that are accessible to many readers. Students will doubtless find this book impenetrable. Some academics who were fooled by Sokal's famous hoax in the journal Social Text will probably be fooled again here."
1,cultural studies at its worst,"This book only incites those who have bashed the work of postmodernists and cultural studies scholars. Unfortunately in this case, the criticisms all apply to this ill-concieved book. The editors at Cornell should hang their heads for approving this turkey."
1,absolutely awful,"This book, quite simply, represents everything that is wrong today with the liberal arts. Dean, a political science professor, has succeeded in authoring a whole book without actually saying anything useful. One need only skip to the book's conclusory pages to realize the depths Dean has plunged in her attempted deconstruction of civilization. Yet, from her positive reviewers, we the shapeless victims of culture are told that our problems with the book stem either from our misunderstanding of its gargantuan truths, or our realization that Dean is a post-modern prophet who must be silenced. I suggest nothing so high-minded; rather, we dissenters simply know a bad book when we see one. I fear the effect of books like this, and the classes that ""teach"" them, on the reputation of a liberal arts education."
1,a sad commentary on the state of academic scholarship,"That this poor book was published by what I thought was a respectable press is bad enough, but then to see the effect that this book has had on some other academics and students (be sure to read the laughable defense of the book by one of Dean's unfortunate students above)who are willing to defend and praise it as ""ground-breaking"" or ""daring"" makes we weep for the future of the academy. Anyone with a respect for truly insightful, original, and dare I say *smart* cultural theory must find this book unrelentingly vacuous."
2,Unlockable!!,"I really like doing Sudoku. This game really isn't hard to adapt to, but there are some flaws. The cheerleader is a pest. The handwriting recognizer sometimes doesn't work, especially for 4,5, and 7. The last problem I have with the game is the ""locked features."" I can't ever go fast enough to unlock the mini-games. Occasionally, when you complete a Sudoku puzzle, you will be allowed to sample a mini-game. It seems that you have to beat the timed mini-game once to unlock it. I can't, so no mini-games for me. Did I mention that reading the instructions for the games is on the timer?"
3,Okay,"This game if fun, the only thing that I really didn't like was when I tried to write a number in the game had problems telling witch number I was writing."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"The number of relatively easy games is pretty low. The use of this product is not very straight-forward, and it seems to be missing some of the features that a less expensive dedicated hand-held suduko game includes.What I was hoping for, was a large selection of games at each level of ability, with the option of assistance. That isn't what I got."
3,Too many quirks,"This seemed like a good Sudoku game at first, but I had to get past its many quirks ...1.) The handwriting recognition doesn't work very well. I quit using that and started using the number pad option, but even that has problems.2.) It's not very good for solving puzzles from other books or newspapers. You can enter a game and solve it, but then it deletes the solution before you have a chance to write it down.3.) It easily corrupts its data. Once the data is corrupted, you have to start all over. That gets frustrating after a couple of times.4.) You have the option of selecting a male or female cheerleader. I'm not exactly going to select a male cheerleader, and my wife didn't care for me selecting the female cheerleader. Why do I need a cheerleader?5.) The hints are a real pain to work with. It could be made much easier to use, but the authors selected the most difficult interface for you to work with."
3,My fault.,I bought a used game. I should have suspected I would get less than I ordered. A third of the games were played already. Disappointing.
1,Review of Platinum Sudoku from Nintendo DS,"I've been doing sudoku puzzles for about three years and have become a fairly good player. I've been able to solve the ""hard"" puzzles in the Brain Age 2 game and I do nothing now but the hard puzzles on a hand held sudoko game I have.The ""easy"" puzzles on Platimum Sudoku are the hardest sudoku puzzles I've ever tried. And, while the Platinum Sudoku game includes lessons on how to solve sudoku puzzles, you cannot access the lessons until you have successfully solved the first batch of puzzles (which you're not likely to do without the lessons) #%@$*&$#."":>("
4,for a beginner.. versus brain age,"I just started playing Sudoku a couple weeks back on the Brain Age 2 cart and I enjoyed playing through a few of the ""easy"" puzzles and learning the game. I decided to go ahead and get a dedicated Sudoku game so I picked this one up. I was a little frustrated by the fact that the ""easy"" beginner puzzles on Platinum Sudoku seem MUCH harder than the ""easy"" puzzles on Brain Age. Just to prove to myself that I wasn't crazy, I fired up the Brain Age version and was able to solve an ""easy"" puzzle in about 20ish minutes where an ""easy"" puzzle on this cart can easily take me an hour.I realize that I am pretty much a Sudoku newbie, so this won't apply to everyone. It would have been really nice for the developers of this game to leave the lessons in the game unlocked so we newbies could get a few hints before we're made to feel like buffoons :)"
4,Very close second.,"I am in agreement with many of the reviewers here--that Platinum Sudoku is very good but comes in second to the sudoku provided in brain age.The interface is somewhat annoying--it seems like a lot of tapping in order to get the possible numbers entered. And I agree that the default font is somewhat hard to read. I appreciate that there is a left-handed set up for the number pad.Overall, I think I have already gotten my money out of this game, and I've only had it for around a week."
4,Disney Princess Cake,"The cake pan worked as stated. By following the instructions, I was able to bake the cake and have it come out of the pan perfect. Decorating was very tedious and required artistic abilities. It is challenging to follow the pattern in the bottom of the cake pan as a guide for decorating since it is the reverse of the baked cake. If you follow the instructions closely the cake can be cute. It does take TIME."
1,This printer consistently disappoints.,"Since day one this printer has been a consistent disappointment. It does produce high-quality scans, but for basic word-processing printing needs, it is the worst printer I have ever owned.The biggest problem is that it doesn't take paper from the feeder properly (and I do use the kind of paper specified by the manufacturer), and as a result often jams. It consumes ink voraciously (even though I have it at the lowest ink-use setting). And (at the risk of anthropomorphizing) it is finicky: it inexplicably always wants to print test sheets and alignment sheets instead of the pages of writing that I want it to print, and it takes a very long time (and uses a lot of ink) to do so.Do not buy this printer. I got it for free from Apple when I bought my laptop, and now I fully understand why they were giving them away. I will probably buy a new one, because this one is so bad that it actually compromises my productivity as a writer."
1,Not not buy this printer if you have Window Vista,"Spent over 8 hours over 2 days on the phone with an HP tech and they could not get it to work correctly. HP support on other products I have seems to be really great, just not for this printer for some reason.The only advice they had for for me was to reinstall the operating system, which did not work.I have several other USB devices and all work with the HP computer I have.Well off to get a new printer."
1,Not At All What I Expected from HP,"Bought this Monday and took it back Tuesday. Scanning was slow and the images were fuzzy. Photos were washed out with lines running through them. Tech support walked me through all the setup steps to correct the problems but it didn't improve the quality AT ALL. A waste of time since I had already done all those things before calling them. Final solution was to use HP Premium Glossy photo paper which I was already using and making sure my ink cartridges were at least 30% full. I had it for 4 hours so, unless they were packaged with used cartridges, I was reasonably confident they were full!!! And yes, the monitor showed they were. Maybe this was just a faulty unit but the reviews don't look encouraging."
1,They lie! Not vista compatible. Horrible HP service also.,"This product does not work with VISTA. Their software upgrade that is supposed to fix it also does not work. Their HP customer service is slow and has never fixed my problem. This is actually the 1st review I have written on a product, and it was inspired by my hatred of this product. Save yourself the headache. Don't buy from HP."
2,Both just Stopped because of ink,"I own 2 of these, worked fine for a while then they both decided their ink cartridges were suddenly incompatible, I even bought them brand new official HP cartridges, and it still claimed they were incompatible. Shame on HP this year. They have really gone down hill.bought new factory cartridges, for WAY TOO much money, about $6,000 a gallon for the ink. And they refused to accept them So now I'm done with HP, too bad you can't still buy analogue it always worked, even if a part broke the rest would work no matter what"
3,Ink Cartidges don't last,"I buy the XL HP-branded cartridges for this printer, and they expire or otherwise stop working even when I haven't used much of the ink. Resetting the ink levels in the firmware doesn't fix the issue. After a couple months, the printer just keeps printing light and blotchy no matter what I do to the cartridges. They aren't low on ink, they just can't put it on the paper evenly. Cleaning the print heads--manually or with the software--does not help. Either HP uses cheap ink that goes bad, or they are trying to scam you by making your cartridges expire quickly. If you do very little printing, look elsewhere, because you can't rely on this printer to be ready and working when you need it unless you replace the cartridges every few months.When the cartridges are new, it's a pretty decent all-in-one. Easy to use and good quality for the price."
2,Installing the printer driver puts way too much junk on your computer,"I have been using a friend's HP F4280 printer and I hate the fact that, in the process of installing the printer driver, it has installed seven separate programs on my hard drive (I can see them in the Control Panel/Programs and Features) It also put a number of icons on my desktop, runs continuously whether I am printing or not, and is always asking me to run updates (I run on windows vista and have is set up to alert me when doing updates) I think this is ridiculous! I remember the old days when you installed the printer driver once, and that was it! I wonder if it is collecting data from me to sell me more stuff..."
4,Happy with printer,"I have had this printer since 2007. I have been very happy with it. The scanner quality and the printer quality are both good. I am a student and have used the printer very regularly, and I typically go through two cartridges a year. I have not had any problems with paper jams.After four years of having the printer, I also had the software problem others mentioned. When I hooked up the scanner to my laptop I would get the error message that the ""USB was not connected"". I reinstalled the driver, but it did not solve the problem. I bypassed the problem by using Image Capture on my mac and using the HP scanner through that program. Admittedly, there is still a software problem with the device, but I was able to come to this solution within a half hour and it works fine for me.Overall, my experience with this printer/scanner has been very positive."
5,Replacement for a dead HP Printer,This printer was purchased to replace a HP Printer that died.The main reason for choosing the printer is because it uses the same ink cartridges as the printer that died.I had just purchased a number of cartridges from a HP re-seller site but the HP model was no longer sold new at stores.HP had moved onto a new printer series that (of course) used different ink cartridges.Thanks to this seller I was able to buy a new printer from the old series and continue to use the same ink cartridges.
2,Works but very finicky,"Have had this printer for about 2 years. It still works but tends to drive me crazy.NEGATIVES1. If it turns off, it requires me to either print a test page or cancel a test page-both take about 1 minute2. The software sometimes just break. I've had to uninstall and reinstall everything multiple times3. The buttons on the printer with/without connection to my laptop also sometimes decide not to work4. It was really difficult to use until I learned to use the HP solution center5. Ink is not cheap6. No document feeder-so takes forever to scan/copy multiple pages7. No wireless printingPOSITIVES1. It still prints, copies, and scans-well most of the timeQuality of print and speed of printing is average at bestThis thing is defintely outdated for now. Go to wal-mart/best buy and you could find a newer better model for half the price listed here."
1,Worthless junk. Don't buy HP products!,"Absolute nightmare. This is the single most unreliable and capricious piece of hardware I have ever had the misfortune to own. My biggest problem comes with the scanner. Scanning works about 50% of the time. As MANY others have noted, there is a repeating ""scanner not connected to USB"" message even when the connection is tested and the printer works fine! Don't be fooled, even higher price HP products will fail. Don't buy ANYTHING from this unscrupulous company."
1,Jam-Master!,"I haven't had the software problems others have had, and the scanner works okay. But it jams four times for each page it prints. A friend who works for HP suggested buying higher quality paper, but now I'm just jamming up more expensive paper. I've sworn off HP for good after this experience. I've been keeping it until I use up the ink cartridge then it's ""hasta la vista, HP."""
1,Breaks quickly,"This product has a 12 month warranty because it breaks on the 13th. (Mine stopped printing black, even with a brand-new cartridge, even after I ran the cleaning and alignment steps.) I called tech support and they wanted to charge me to troubleshoot my product over the phone. This is not a quality printer. Don't buy it if you want something that will last."
1,Horrible,"While I have used several multi-use copiers in the past, I desired to upgrade to a wireless version that everyone in my family could use easily. Unfortunately, I purchased this one. While I had very little difficulty getting the wireless working with our Window's Vista computers, they programs that come with the printer are horrible. First, They are not user friendly and are difficult to follow or get help within the program (or online). Second, it runs 2 seperate programs in order to scan and save your images to your PC. Even now, we are only able to save the images we scan about 25% of the time. My wife has asked me to reinstall our old Lexmark printer so we can sell/trash this one.I would recomend that HP review the software for this item see if someone can create a more user friendly version. In the meanwhile, I would recomend that you purchase a printer from another manufacturer. I would recomend a Lexmark, Brother, or Epson instead."
2,Printer tries to reinstall repeatedly!!,"This printer prints fine as well as scans, etc. I would be happy with it, EXCEPT that the software keeps trying to reinstall itself repeatedly! I have to keep task manager open to keep stopping the installs. I've updated all the drivers and can't get any resolution from HP online. I don't know if this happens to everyone, but I use XP and this is an annoyance. Also, when I plug my Canon camera into the computer, the software thinks it's the HP printer and can't read it."
1,Decent piece of equipment paired with half-baked software,"Pros: Equipment exceeds Lexmark quality, by far.Cons: Software is just plain unfinished.My overall review is one star because of the very aggravating user experience provided by the HP Solution Center and associated software.Printer is fairly well made. It has worked great for the past two years, besides the occasional ""Print cartridge missing or not aligned"" error message which disables all functionality except printing from a PC until the cartridge is replaced.The problem is the software. It looks great, but it runs like an alpha or really bad beta version of software. I dare anyone who owns this device to successfully scan three one-page documents and have them as complete, usable files within ten minutes. Between error messages, ""HP Scanning"" program freezes, and incomplete scans, each page takes a solid 5 minutes to scan and export."
3,Ink Cartridge Jams and jams and jams,"I purchased this printer because it was discounted with my computer purchase 4-5 years ago. I had so many issues with this printer. Every time I change the printer I receive 1 or 2 messages: carriage jam or paper jam..even though there is no paper. So, I keep fooling with it (and wasting ink in the process)to get it working. Once some of the ink is out, the printer starts to work again. It is like the printer doesn't work with too much ink.This printer eats up a lot of ink. I have purchased ink 3-4 times and have used just a little over 1 pack of paper. I don't use the printer much. But it takes a lot of ink to print from this printer.Scan works well, but there is no way to change the format in order to fax using the free fax services online.Bottom like, its not worth it."
3,so-so,"I feel ok having this printer however, the shipping was awful! the box looked like it came from a jungle. Several parts of the printer fell down and I had to fixed it. Don't know what happened anyways, the printer works fine."
1,Poor performer,"In use with Mac OS 10.4, this all-in-one is a nightmare in the small office. It jams on about half of its attempts to feed paper, and has no good access to the interior for clearing paper jams. Removing the back panel reveals cheap, brittle plastic involved in the moving parts of the unit.Scanner often produces skewed, cut-off images even with automatic straightening turned off - and the software (HP Scan Pro) regularly crashes while in use.This printer is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for. In this case, you'd be better off spending the money on a toaster - it would perform almost as well in the all-in-one print/scan/copy market."
1,No More HP for me,"HP 4280 all-in-one. Can I give this negative stars? This machine is so fussy. I have had to reinstall the driver about 4 times in the last 2 months. It is an absolute ink hog. Even when I remember to set it for draft quality, it uses heaps of ink. And then it reverts automatically back to ""hungry"" mode. Scan quality sucks too. I can get a better ""scan"" with my cheap digital camera. This one goes back to HP or ebay to some other sucker."
2,Will make you buy only HP ink,HP has a trick wherin they will only allow you to use HP ink or else this machine will show Cartridge not detected. I have decided to just buy another printer than succumb to this sneakiness.
1,I hate this thing,"Absolute Pain. Does not sync with mac well at all. Barely prints in one usb, runs out inc so quickly, does not scan for whatever dumb reason or another. Impossible to use."
1,It fried itself,"I was using it and was happy with it. One day I was making a copy, it just stopped. I could smell electrical/plastic smell. It just DIED. Tried contacting HP and was given the brush off. What a joke these people turned out to be. Good Luck if you buy this one."
4,HP Printer,Great product. It even does double sided prints. Only downfall is that the ink doesn't last long & every time you put a new ink in it makes you print a test page.
5,Very Happy,"I am very happy with this printer. If following the directions, installation is very simple! I would recommend getting the larger print cartridges (as inexpensive on Amazon as the smaller ones are in the store)."
1,Aggrevating printer,"I work with computers for a living and don't think I have ever had a more frustrating experience. Here are the good points: 1. It looks nice. Here are the bad. 1. The ink is very expensive, additionally, the cartridges are time stamped and expire- even if they are brand new. It's a way for HP to make more money 2. The printer only works some of the time- it starts to print and then freezes. Apparently there is a known bug with the USB interface which HP never bothered to fix. My first computer printer which I bought in the early 90's was more reliable (Canon). I HATE this printer."
3,More driver problems,"This is an inexpensive all-in-one unit. It isn't very fast and yes, you will run out of ink much more quickly than you think you should, but the print quality seems to be pretty good for a unit in this price range.I have purchased several of these units and have had problems with driver installation on each one. The driver installation program is buggy. This is an ongoing problem with driver installation with any HP Inkjet product but it seems especially bad with this unit. If you call tech support (and you probably will) they can help you with a few tricks that they know to get the driver working."
1,This thing is terrible,"Scanning abilities: Terrible image, no accurate, doesn't scan entire document...Printing: Constantly needs realighnment, goes through ink like none other...copying; no such thing...Why do I still have it; I'm not entirely sure..."
1,Amazing performance> not in a good way,"This printer has probably contributed to a measurable decrease in my life expectancy due to the stress of inevitable paper jams, erroneous messages about being out of paper when the carriage is full, frequent problems pulling the paper through, paper jams, paper jams, more paper jams.Words can't even begin to capture how much I hate this printer, the only reason I would give it one star is that most printers are mysteries and have their own little idiosyncrasies that need to be worked around, but for this particular model I would reserve a special place in the fiery depths.On a positive note, it does seem to work well with Mac OS10... in theory. In other words, the interface is manageable... but oh my gosh, what a horribly dreadful little machine."
1,Trouble!,"Problen exists printing from MS Word. All other applications, including MS Excel and MS Powerpoint print properly. Chatting with HP representatives about two weeks now with no resolution. Don't know if it's a printer problem, a software problem or a computer problem, except that I didn't have any problems with MS Word with previous printer, except it was getting old."
2,Not Happy,Really glad I am getting a full rebate. After 3 days of use the ink cartridges for black and color were empty and I did not do that much printing. Seems to jam easily and confuse easily. I am going to go back to using my old printer and let my daughter use this one to print school work.
1,Slow ink hog,"I have printed fewer than 50 sheets of text with my printer and it says I'm out of ink. Also, the scanner takes forever and the copier takes even longer. What a horrible waste of money. Can't wait to go buy some overpriced ink. AVOID THIS ALL IN ONE!"
1,Horribe...Awful...Frustrating,"Jam after Jam....Cartridge not easy to insertgets everything mixed up....so hard to get something printed...because it continues to click on CopyThen..Hard to turn off...You keep pressing the On button to press it off and it just gets stuck.Horrible, Horrible....don't waste your money....The worst printer ever.Terry from New York"
5,The HP 4280 is a great printer,"This review is for the HP 4280 printer/copier. The 4280 is a great printer. It prints fast and accurately. It uses two printer cartridges. You can temporarilly replace one of them with a special photo cartridge, when needed, for more accurate color when printing photographs.The LCD on it is in color.It has a card reader for camera memory cards, so it could be used without a computer. You can do basic corrections and changes to photos before printing them.This is not a wireless printer. It needs to be hooked up to a computer with a USB cable if you want to use it with a computer.Very good printer, particularly considering the price, which at the time of this review is running around $79 - $99 dollars."
3,HP All in One Printer,I got the machine in a timely manner and it is great!! I have struggled with all manner of single use gadgets but this does it all. and a great price and good mechanics. Easy to use and makes good copies.
4,HP C4280 All in One review,"I really like my new HP All in one Printer. It's fast in printing and copying. And the quality of the prints is very nice.Only little drawbacks are that it scans a little slow and I don't really care for the paper tray placement because it's on the bottom of the unit. But, overall, I'm pleased with my purchase."
2,Problems with this printer,"I have two computers that I use this printer with. On one of them the printer keeps trying to reinstall the program. On the other one it's fine, but on both of them the scanning option doesn't work most of the time. I keep getting the error ""USB cable not connected"" but it is connected. Sometimes the scanner works. The printer works well and I haven't had any problems with it, except that it uses ink fast."
1,Printer hangs forever on my mac.,"Printer is hung and can't print anything on my Mac. After 3 weeks of work, the driver is completely broken on the Mac. Just insane.Avoid the headache. Don't buy this printer."
1,Limited use on Macs,"The printer works with Macs like it says, but it doesn't have all the featues on Mac that it does with Windows. For instance, it cannot do manual double sided printing on a Mac along with several other features. I would not recommend this product if you use Apple products. It took HP almost an hour to discuss the issues with me that I was having and they simply told me because I had a Mac, I wouldn't get the full package available with this printer. If you have Windows though, it seems to work fine."
1,Don't Buy This Printer,"This printer has had problems from the first day we bought it. The scanner has never worked, and we constantly get an error alerting us that the ""printer cartridge is missing"". Constantly.It takes forever to start and the printer cartridges are very small. (This is why they are cheaper than the others. Don't be fooled.) Also, we very often receive alerts stating that ""updates are available"", which is HP trying to sell us ink."
1,Piece of junk,"This printer is a piece of junk. It's only a year old, and you have to turn it off and back on between every single page because its print cartridge suddenly becomes ""missing"" in the middle of a job. Writing something out in longhand would be faster than trying to get a job printed. Don't buy it."
1,C.R.A.P.,"This printer is a JOKE.Once it slips into sleep mode you typically have to uninstall and then reinstall the software all over again.And, anyone who uses an HP printer knows how much fun that is. How BIG can a printer driver REALLY be.Spend more money on a better product and ALWAYS check customer follow ups. They typically are right on the money."
2,Not with it,When my wife recieved this item it was missing th USB cord. When she called about it she was told that she would have to pay for a new one. The printer/scanner/copier works fine but I'm not to happy that they didn't send the USB cord and than was told I would have to pay in order to get one.
1,Worst printer experience ever,"I don't usually write reviews, but this is one of the crappiest products I've purchased in a long time. NOTHING works right. When I try to print or copy, it spits out blank pages and partial pages. Before almost every copy or print job, it says ""carriage jammed"", and I have to open the front hatch and jiggle the ink cartridges. When I try to scan, it says ""USB cable not connected"" (it's connected...that's how I was able to sort-of print). It's a nice looking unit...probably more suited to sitting on a desk at a furniture store."
1,"Awful, avoid like the plague.","I had great hopes for this product, the combination of copying, scanning and printing at a great price from HP seemed too good to be true. Well it was, too good to be true. The paper handling mechanism is amazingly bad it never pulled just one page into the printer. I'm throwing this out and looking for something with performance like one normally expects from HP."
4,Solving the scanning problem,"For those experienced scanning problem on Windows 2000, try this:1. After you have installed the HP C4280 installation files, look for HPQSCNVW.exe (i.e. HP Scanning App file for Windows 2000), it is likely stored here (""C:\Program Files\HP\Digital Imaging\bin\hpqscnvw.exe"") or under a Hewlett-Packard folder.If you can't find the above file, try to look for this file: ""C:\Program Files\HP\Digital Imaging\bin\hpqdirec.exe"", it is also a scanning application file.2. Create a shortcut to this application file on your desktop, and once you have plugged in your C4280 USB to your PC, launch this app and the scanning will work.The problem you encountered was due to after the installation, HP's app file somehow didn't manage to be created as an icon or shortcut on the desktop.3. For those on Windows XP and Vista, if you still encountered scanning problem, e.g. USB not connected, etc. Follow steps 1 and 2 above, but look for: HPQSCNVW.exe or HPQTRA08.exe files instead in step 1."
1,what a junker,"I would never buy this printer again; it is a piece of junk. It keeps cloging on new, good paper, prints dog slow and generally works poorly. I would not recomend the printer."
1,Avoid the HPC4480,"I purchased two of these for our office, and deeply regret that decision. The printer spams the heck out of you with ink level pop-ups, trying to get you to buy more ink. The popups aren't even accurate. The memory card slots took over the F: drive position, which was already in use on both systems. On both systems, we've experiences enormous slowdowns with MS apps. There is a 15 second delay in Excel when printing or changing print settings, and Word sometimes won't print at all. We've taken to printing to a PDF file and then sending the document to the printer because it's faster. HP support was no help. Multiple e-mails resulted in solutions that either killed the ability to scan or that directed us to options in the ""solutions center"" that didn't exist. Stay away."
2,I do not recommend this printer,"I purchased this printer couple of months back. Whenever I try to print after my Windows XP desktop has been inactive for a while it queues up the job and does not print. When I reboot my desktop, it then tries to re-install the driver that came with the printer and then the printer starts accepting print jobs. I have gone through the driver install quite a few times. On the positive side the quality of the printouts are quite good."
1,Do not buy this printer,"I don't usually write reviews but I felt compelled to warn people about this printer. I bought it three weeks ago to replace an HP Photosmart P1000 that I had for six years, which was a troublesome printer from the first day. I should have known better than to buy another HP. The C4280 tries to reinstall the software every single time I plug in the USB cable. I send something to print and it sits there for two or three mintues ""thinking"" about it before it finally decides to print. It took a week for me to get the scanner to work. Now I have a cartridge jam and I can find no paper fragments or anything else blocking the cartridge carriage. I tried unplugging the power source and plugging it back in and now it won't even turn on."
2,Phantom Permanent Paper Jam,"I had this printer connected to an Airport Extreme, which gave family members on the network access to printing, but not scanning. This has to do with the AEBS, not the printer. Everything was consistently fine, although it does run through ink quickly. One day the printer decided it had a paper jam even though there was no paper anywhere inside it. I followed every solution provided by HP, spent hours Googling it, and alas, the paper jam message would not go away. Eventually I had to throw it out. So my experience is that it's fine while it lasts, but don't expect more than a year and a half out of it."
1,Waste of time and money,"Printer doesn't print black, even though ink supply is new. This is the worst piece of junk, ever! I am angry that I allowed Apple to sell me this piece of s***! HP has lost its 'quality' reputation with me! I'll buy a canon or epson next time."
1,operating this printer a full time job,"When I first tried to scan something on this ""all-in-one"", it didn't work. I called HP and after a long time on the phone they told me that I needed a special driver to get the scanner to work (even though the printer was working fine).That was when I was trying to scan a photo. Now I'm trying to scan an 8 x 10 sheet of paper for the first time. On whatever default setting is at work here, the scanner only scans a small section of the paper. I've been looking for a way to change this setting for half an hour.I'm sure there's some setting or button that will cause this scanner to scan and 8 x 10 piece of paper, and if using my printer was my full time job I'd be happy to look for it some more. But getting this all in one to do it's primary tasks just doesn't seem worth the time it takes."
1,Please avoid.,"Not only is this printer a failure in the ways discussed by other reviewers, but HP's customer service is a disgrace."
1,Quite possibly the worst printer of all time,"Warning: this printer will give you more headaches that the low price will have you believe that it is worth. It managed to print black ink for me TWICE before deciding to print all black as light blue (even after repeated cleanings and alignments). Turn it on and you automatically get an alignment page printed even if you didn;t ask for it. Then you may get a ""USB Not Connected"" error even when it is connected. Then the scanner stops working for no apparent reason. Make no mistake baout it: this printer is absolute garbage."
2,Horrible picture printing,This printer does okay scanning and printing black and white but when it comes to what I actually bought it for (picture printing) it is absolutely horrible. Even on the best photo paper it can't live up to its name. Steer clear of this one if you are looking for high quality photo printing.
1,Bad quality!,"I bought this printer at Best Buy assured by the salesperson that it would be a good printer for my needs (casual printing, and photo printing). Little did I know, IT'S NOT. Beware, it took me 4 hours to install this printer on my network. This should've taken me 45 minutes tops! The main reason being that the installation CD that came WITH the printer, did not have the drivers for this printer (it had it for some other HP printer). My other 2 options were to call HP for the CORRECT cd, or download it for free online. I did the latter, which took ages because the files were huge! Then, this morning it took me an hour to print a 40 page document because this printer kept getting jammed, then I had to feed the paper manually! So all in all, I've spent 5 hours trying to maneuver this printer, and I bought it for the sole reason of convenience (aka spend little time on this thing and move on). I am very disappointed, and plan of returning it ASAP."
1,Here we go again.,"All of you are hereby instructed to bypass any cd that has the label ""TeeVee"" on it.Once again they have taken late period remakes, this time from Carl Smith, and packaged them like they were the originals.I love Carl Smith's output from the 1950's, 60's and even some of the 1970's. The music here was taken from some session in the 1980's, and honestly Mr. Smith just doesn't seem like he was too excited.Please avoid this collection and look for ""The Essential Carl Smith,"" and ""The 60's Hits of Carl Smith."""
4,Great value and support,"The cup size does seem to run small, but the bra is a fantastic value for the price. The comfort and support are excellent. It is a rare find. Despite the fact that the bra is all cotton, it keeps it shape and support. The only thing I would change is the nursing clasp: the hook-and-eye style requires two hands."
5,Perfect,"This was a gift for my newly breast feeding daughter. All of the other bras she had would not fit correctly, the straps hurt or tore. this bra was comfortable and fit her perfectly and she loved it so i got her more."
1,not labeled correctly,"It seemed to be well-made but it was not labeled correctly, because it fit like a B cup rather than an E.I should have listened to the other reviews."
3,Ehh,"The bra is very comfortable, but sooo not a 34DD... I like it, but don't know what size to order since the sizing is off"
4,Festool- Makita etc,"Actually these blades DO fit a number of other jigsaws. Good blades, but Festool is 1 lb lighter and has a true dust extractor system, AND takes a Collins coping foot (which the Bosch 1590-1591 will not). Bosch blades are still great. Use them with other saws, too. 5 stars if they came in 145 or 155 mm lengths for sandwich materials, as Festool blades do."
3,Good Gandhian Philiosophy,"This is as good of a summation of Gandhi and satyagraha as there is available. Bondurant really applies the philosophy to a range of social contexts, which is helpful to a reader seeking to understand how Gandhi's work applies to the 21st century."
4,Inspiring,"Lovely, thought provoking words of wisdom. Though small in size, it is chock-full of inspiration."
4,"Nice band, but short","This is an attractive watchband at a reasonable price. Be aware, however, that the standard length is quite short. I have a small wrist and it is on the next-to-last (longest) hole on a watch with a 1"" face. If you have a small watch, you should probably order the long size. Also, be aware that it does not come with the pins. The Watchband Store sent it very quickly."
5,BEST CD EVER,EVERYONE NEEDS TO GET THIS CD!! HE IS THE FUNNIEST COMEDIAN I HAVE EVER HEARD! THIS IS A ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE!!
3,A little bit funny,"It wasn't as funny as I had expected. I suppose you'll need to see Stephen's facial expressions when he sings these songs to get the joke. Lullabye, Gerbil, Gay, secial ed and the guy who did Christopher Walken were good. Lynch is a really good singer, which I cannot say for many comedians who do a cd like this. For this reason, I don't regret owning it, but choose wisely. It may not be your cup of tea."
5,Stephen Lynch - A Little Bit Special,"Stephen Lynch is easily one of the most talented (albeit twisted!) young comedians around. His voice is deceptively innocent, but his lyrics are penetratingly satirical. I think that Lynch is a ghostwriter for Southpark! The Christopher Walken impersonations by Jay Mohr (Jerry Maquire, Go, Pay it Forward, The Simpsons [as Walken], etc) are also priceless.To truly appreciate his comic genius, though, you have to watch him perform. His facial expressions are hilarious! Hopefully, he'll make it down to Columbus, OH someday so I can experience his performance in person. Until then, I have to wait for a rerun on the Comedy Channel...."
5,"Voice of an angel, mind of a pretzel...","This guy is so twisted...he thinks like I do!! If these songs were baseball pitches, they's all be changeups. He starts out with these incredibly beautiful guitar licks, he adds a honeyed voice and words of rapturous wonder to lull you into complacency then...WHAM!!!!...right between the eyes, out of left field, no idea it was coming, you get a double-dose of perversity so stunning, you can't stop laughing in time to catch all the words. So you listen again...and again. And even when you've finally heard ALL the words, you listen again, because you just can't believe it's happening. This guy could have been a serious actor, musician or poet, but anyone with a dose of talent could have been any of those. Not many could have blended all those talents into this one hilarious package; if he comes to your town, or one of his specials is on TV, consider him a must-see. Until then, don't pass by this CD; Stephen Lynch is a rare genius."
5,This cd is excellent,"Every song on this album is hilarious. Pretty much all the songs start out like pansy songs but all of a sudden, Lynch pops out these insanly funny lyrics. I think the best example of this is ""Lullaby"" where he sings to his daughter about why her mother left. It starts out sweet, but comes the reasons for his wife's departure : ""Daddy gets drunk and robs liquor stores"" Bottom Line: Buy It"
4,Beautifully shocking; a riot,"I first heard of Stephen Lynch from his Comedy Central special, in which he masterfully put his songs together in the form of a kid's show (i.e. Mr. Roger's Neighborhood). I believe this album includes most of the songs from that show, along with other gems from Lynch's radio repertoire. Many people get upset or disturbed when they hear his lyrics, but isn't that the point? He sings in the voice and style of a talented folk-rocker, but his lyrics are twisted. This odd combination really drives home the ridiculousness of the people and situations in his lyrics. I believe that it is meant as a sort of ""Theatre of the Absurd"". The result is fresh and unique. What more could you ask for? -- hard-hitting humor and quality music wrapped into one. People prone to righteous indignation need not buy this; you need to have an open mind to get it. Enjoy!!"
4,you have to be in the mood,i belive steve lynch is a genus you have laugh about is usally discusting lyrics and in a very wierd way relate to them
2,His Comedy Central Performance was misleading,"When I saw Mr. Lynch on Comedy Central performing some of his more ""innocuous"" tunes (if he really has any) ""Special Ed"", ""Lullaby"", ""Hermafrodite"", and ""If I were Gay"", I was mildly amused.Sadly, his album fell short of my expectations. He relied moslty on bathroom-type humor which I found lacking and just not that funny. I don't know, maybe Wierd Al spoiled me. He was able to use humor without having it be crude. Not that a little coarseness is bad... but in this case, it seems like Lynch is just using it as a gimmic, as a means unto itself.My favorite tracks were, to be frank, the NON-offensive ones- like ""Jim Henson's Dead"" (if you hear the track, you'll know what I mean.)Lullaby has a catchy tune and isn't TOO bad... but a lot of the other songs on this CD are just plain sick!(One thing though- the MELODIES themselves are quite good; Lynch is very talented... but maybe next time he can work his way down to PG-13 or NC-17, as opposed to XXXXX-893?)"
2,Not his best,"There is some really funny stuff on the CD, but his newer stuff is so much more thought out and keeps you rolling. Good sick fun for those with sick minds."
2,Needs an audience,"A few reviewers made note of the fact that this CD is a studio collection of Lynch's material; this is an important point. Without the audience feedback, be it delighted laughter or shocked amazement, the songs have to stand on their own merit. As they are recorded in a studio, you will quickly notice an amazing similarity in song after song, the gentle falsetto, the hummable but forgettable melodies, and the incredibly inappropriate lyrics, are all repeated time after time. The songs lose their ability to shock when lumped together like this. They become predictable and repetitive. I like Lynch's rather bizarre contribution to the world of comedy, but in this setting, without the immediacy of a live performance, the songs themselves don't really hold up."
4,definatly sick and twisted,"I assume no one will even think about purchasing any of Stephen's work unless they had already seen one of his shows. So I will say if you like his other stuff you will certainly like this as well. The CD isn't as great as watching him perform, but for those that are not in his list of tour cities, this is the only way to hear his songs. He is very clever and definatly sick and twisted."
5,**I Love This CD**,"This CD Is The Funniest CD Since Seinfeld's: I am telling you for the last time. I can't explain everything about this cd because you'll have to listen to it for yourself. What I can say is that Girbil Is the funniest song ever lol listen to the end of the song thats the greatest part of all download it or buy the album for your self to see what I am talking about. I can tell you this Stephen Lynch brings a laugh to your face with Jim Henson is Dead, he sings about how he wants another bite of Ms. Piggy and her tastey pork. Any ways this cd is the funniest so buy it if you dont have it all ready!"
4,There's Something Funny About This!,"This is a very funny CD from a very funny guy. Stephen sounds like a normal musician, until you listen a little more closely to the lyrics. Half a Month Dead, Special, Priest, Lullaby--all classics. But the one most guaranteed to elicit a reaction is Gerbil. Stephen sang this at a local club in Baltimore and before he released it, and was astounded when the enthusiastic audience sang it for/with him! Definitely a CD worth a listen, especially by those unsuspecting friends and relatives..."
4,JULIE LOVES STEPHEN,"I love this cd! Stephen is one of the most creative and unpredictable songwriters around. I can't wait to hear more of his genius shine through new, innovative songs. Aside from his lyrics and melodies, Stephen's voice is heavenly! The mix of that angelic voice and the sweet guitar licks stimulate ones mind like nothing else can. The only reason this album is getting four stars is for the lack of Stephen's picture slapped on it - he's very cute!"
5,Wow!,"I saw Stephen Lynch's performance on Comedy Central, and immediately looked for any CD -- I was thrilled to come across this one. Sure...its not your everyday material -- those who take things way too seriously may get a tad confused. But for those of us who are not comedically handicapped -- this is a must buy! Lynch has a terrific talent for fitting ""interesting"" lyrics to wonderful music. His voice equals (or in some cases, tops) any top forty artist -- I am just sorry there isn't a video to go along with it!"
5,The funniest thing since Adam Sandler,This CD is great. It is very funny. I have not been able to stop listening to it. Stephen's lyrics capture the essence of dark humor. The icing on the cake is that he has a great voice. Many artist don't have a good voice they simply rely on the beats and lyrics. Stephen is able to capture everything. He is not just a comedian is a true artist.
5,One Of The Best,"Each track is individually brilliant.Llnch will cover any topic he feels,and not hold back while doing so.Buy it if you want to laugh!"
5,Very Funny Stuff!!!,"This Cd is just very good. I can't stress that enough. For anyone who is offended by the lyrics or don't like it for another reason, shut up. Who cares what you think. This guy writes some of the funniest songs and You have to love them. I strongly suggest buying this CD by Stephen Lynch."
5,Great Album a must buy,This has got to be one of the best albums I've heard. He is so funny that you cant stop laughing. Every song is a riot. You must buy this.
5,Stephen Lynch is a God,I think A Little Bit Special is one of the greatest comedy releases that has come out since Richard Prior was putting out albums in the 70's. Stephen is great at combining great comic lyrics & eazy to listen to music. I love this CD. I give it a A++++++
1,Spectre Large Shift Boot,"This is the first Spectre product I've been disappointed in. I expected it to be an inexpensive knock off, with the same mounting dimensions as the Hurst Super Boot. The mounting pattern does not match and will only work if new mounting holes are drilled. Also, the rubber is so thick and stiff it doesn't work very well as a shift boot. I do not recommend this product.Spectre 6284 Universal Rectangular Large Shift Boot"
4,Looks good so far,"I need an odd size -- x long twin. It's difficult to find the size locally, and I never know what I'm going to get when I order sight unseen. However, this looks good. It's cushy, and soft and no mesh sides, which is a definite plus because they always tear. Fits my thick mattress so well, I've recommended it to my daughter who is looking for a pad for her king size. I don't know how it will wash, but I am certainly satisfied with the look, feel, and fit right now. I've washed other pads with the same backing, and I don't put them in the dryer. I probably will do the same with this one."
5,Great mattress pad,You can't beat this mattress pad for the price paid or even for more. Very comfortable and washed up without wrinkling or shrinking. Extremely good value.
5,Great quality,I bought 2 twins and a full for beds where I've recently added 4 inches of memory foam over the current mattress. These pads fit beautifully with plenty of room in the side depth. There is no pucker in the corners and the quilted fabric is awesome. Looks like I have a new bed. The side mesh is thick and sturdy. I love these and would recommend them freely. Did I also mention free super saver shipping? What more could you ask for :)
2,Creases and folds after a few nights use,"Nice surface, but the material of the sides doesn't hold it secure, so the pad gets creases and folds in it very quickly, meaning every morning it has to be pulled smooth again. Not worth the money."
1,shrinks in cold water!,i bought several covers and this one has held up to accidents but they all shrunk in cold water. i wish i could return all of my covers as newpoint's products are horrible!
5,Great and the right price!,"The corners of some inexpensive mattress pads don't stay on and as a result the mattress pad slides all over the place, frequently exposing the mattress. But not this mattress pad. I'm so glad I found it."
4,Nice for the Price,For the price it is a nice product. I got it on sale for $l5.00. You can't beat that and it fits perfectly.
5,great mattress pad covers,"i ordered 2 of these mattress covers , and i am very happy with the great quality of them , they are the nicest i have ever seen , and they were on sale too !!! so i am thrilled !!"
1,Will Not Buy Again,"First off, I received a used mattress pad. The one I received had blood on it and I guess Newpoint tried to package it as new.Secondly, the mattress pad is made in China and the quality is not great. I would have gladly paid more for not going through this trouble.I don't understand how this product was rated so highly. Perhaps Newpoint paid some ghost reviewers to get more sales. I do NOT recommend buying this."
3,Not as impressed,I was not as impressed with this pad as other reviewers. It is adequate & will serve its purpose. Amazon lists the regular price at $80. It is more like a 40-50 $ item. Would sell for 15-25 on sale at a place like Kohls.
1,It's not a cotton pad!,The New Point Home Deluxe 250-Thread-Count Cotton Damask Stripe Full Mattress PadThis is nowhere near a cotton mattress pad. The only cotton is the top cover.The rest is plain old synthetic stuff.The 1st time I washed/dried it it started to come apart and this was on lo heat to no heat.So it is not as advertised. Definitely not a cotton pad. I never write reviews unless there is a huge disparity between what it's supposed to be and what I got.I lost on this one.ps: Amazon wants to put this review in the kitchen. It's a bedding product.
1,It melts in the dryer on the lowest delicate heat setting!,This product is worthless...DON'T BUY. The care tag says to dry on low heat. Product is defective as the backing melted when dried on the lowest heat setting of my dryer.
4,Purchased for an air mattress; good value for price,"I bought this to top off an air mattress for use when company visits. It fits the mattress well, provides extra cushion/softness and stays on the mattress through several nights; would buy again for this purpose.Based on other reviews, I wash in hot water, but use the air dry (no heat) feature of the clothes dryer."
4,Good Value,"Product performing as advertized. No shrinkage after wash & dry. For aesthetics, I'd choose a flat surfaced, rather than quilted, pad in the future since the quilted lines of this pad show through the fitted sheet."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"I haven't used the cover yet. However, the NEW cover already had numerous tears on the fabric upon delivery. I want to return this, but since I'm in the process of moving, I am forced to keep this defective item. The whole thing just looks like it's so cheaply made. Trust me, it's not worth your money."
3,Great for the price,"I ordered it for myself but the sheets i got were a little too small so i didn't need it. I gave it to my boyfriend and its VERY comfy. When it gets really hot in the summer, we would take the sheets off and just sleep on the mattress pad because its so comfy. However, i didn't notice a huge change between his bed before and after he put it on."
2,Could've been better,I ordered this to go over an air mattress. It does stretch well but I was not impressed with the amount of filling in this pad. The description makes it sound like it is really full but it fell kinda flat. If I were going to use it everyday I would definitely send it back!
5,"Cool, comfortable.","For the money, this is a very nice quilted mattress pad, and very comfortable for sleeping. Thick enough to protect my mattress, and actually seems to make it more comfortable."
5,Love this mattress pad,Received item in a timely manner. Was amazed at how nice this mattress pad was for the price. It fits my 17 inch mattress just right probably due to the elasticized material on the sides. And it is so comfy. Wonderful buy.
5,mattress pad,"Very nice quality. I'm glad I bought 2. Haven't washed them yet, but so far very pleased."
5,Newpoint Home Deluxe Mattress Cover,The material was quality material and all the stiching was stronly bound. The product seemed to have all the quality of a much more expensive cover.
4,Good looking mattress cover,"I like the way it fits my mattress, it is quilted and looks good. I have not washed it yet, so I don't know how it will withstand the wash and dry. If I revise this review it will be because it fell appart. So far so good. Not bad for the price."
4,matress cover,"i am very happy with my purchase. i dont know when matress covers became insanely expensive,that is why i got this one. it was on sale and well worth the $$$$$$. i would buy again"
5,So Far So Good,"I haven't washed this cover yet, so I'm not sure how it will do longterm, but it fits my bed very well and is nice and thick but seems breathable too. Our last cover was pretty thin, so this is a nice step up."
5,great product for the money,this is well made and very nice for the money. It is plush and the sides are much better than the mattress pads I've had in the past. I would recommend this product and will be buying another.
3,Thinner than most others,"This was the first time I actually read reviews before getting one of these, before I just got whatever the cheapest one I saw in the store. Bought based on Amazon reviews, but was quite disappointed, it was significantly thinner than all of my previous cheap ones, though it feels nice to the touch (which is of less importance than softness). Just be prepared that it offers virtually no extra padding, just something to separate the bed sheet from the actual mattress."
3,More Like a Thick Sheet,"Fit is good (king bed) but not much in the way of padding - I'd say 1/4 inch thick at best. No way it weighs 20lbs, more like 5."
5,Fantastic mattress pad!,I read the reviews on this product and was hoping for my reaction to be the same. It is!! This item is wonderful and a bargain to boot! I would highly recommend this item. I went back and purchased 4 more for the rest of my home.
3,Convenient and cheap but doesn't add much,"I bought this for use at college on my apartment bed. I liked the majority of the reviews - the only real negative ones came from those who had troubles with washing (well...drying) it. I've washed it several times already with my sheets then tumble dried it with no heat and did not have any problems. I've used it for about half a year now and feel like its so thin that it doesn't really add any comfort to the bed. I like that it's an extra layer between me and the mattress, but it's already gotten very worn down and flattened out a great deal. It's a good price, but I think I'm going to look into something more comfortable for next year."
1,Wierd material,"After washing and drying (low heat) the pad has large ""blisters"" on the bottom, it looks like a really bad sunburn.Why would a manufacturer make a mattress pad that can't be washed and dried? It's going back, get ready Amazon."
3,reviews misleading,"This mattress cover is really perfectly fine- it fits and seems like decent quality, but it is nothing special at all, and really not a ""pad"" at all, simply an adequate plain basic cover. It was not what I was looking for or expected from the reviews."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I decided to buy a new mattress pad when I bought a new mattress this month, and this was pretty much what I wanted. It fits my memory foam mattress perfectly; it's not too big or too small. I wasn't looking for something to make my mattress softer or more comfortable, so if you're looking for that, this isn't it.I haven't tried washing it yet, but when I do, I might just try to line dry it (in my tiny apartment)."
4,"It's a nice one, but shrinks after I washed it",It's is a very good quality pad. It looks nice too. I washed it and the pad didn't melt as other review said. But it does shrink a little bit after i washed it and used low heat as instructed. It doesn't fit my queen size matress very well now. I will buy another one and dry without heat.
5,Great Product,"I am very pleased with my purchase of this waterproof mattress pad. It does not have a ""noisy"" plastic sound when in use. It wears well, washes well and fits snuggly."
3,Home Deluxe Damask Twin XL Comforter,"This mattress pad was so-so. It looked nice and fit my bed fantastically. It had long sides to cover even deep mattresses. As far as comfort though, it really wasn't that thick. I used it for my college bunk and was really hoping for something nice and padded but this fell short of my expectations, especially from other reviews.I thought I was getting a super bargain at this price, but I guess it was too good to be true. One of my friends even sat on my bed and chided me for not buying a mattress pad. I would not recommend if you're looking for something above average."
4,Good product.,"I haven't used it for long time yet, but initial impressions are that this product will last long and will protect mattress."
1,STINKS!!! should be no stars,Literally. It stinks of chemicals. Washing doesn't remove the odor. If you like chemicals then this is the product for you. Another gift for Goodwill.
5,Thank you!,"Nice fit! And quite comfortable. I haven't washed it yet, but thanks to everyone's comments here, I'll use caution in the dryer. I ordered king size and it fit our deep, king size bed beautifully. Actually, the best fitting mattress cover we've found!"
5,"Good Quality, Priced right","I bought this as investment for my new Mattress. I want to keep it clean, fresh and looking new for many years to come. This Mattress pad fits easily over my extra thick mattress and stays puts! However in my quest to find the perfect nights sleep; I don't sleep on it I use a featherbed instead. So the comfort level is really unknown to me. But it appears nicely quilted and very well made. This is primarily used as a mattress protector.UPDATE:This is my second purchase. I bought a Queensize for my bed and re-ordered a full size for my daughter's bed. Very well made. Durable. Adds comfort and protects your matress. After reading some other reviews I wouldn't even think of putting this in the dryer! Line dry!"
3,A Pretty Good Buy,"It wasn't as thick at as I excepted and had a small spot on it when I opened it, but it's much more comfortable than just sleeping on the mattress."
5,great mattress pad for the price,"I bought a new mattress recently and ordered this pad on a whim. I was worried that it would be poorly made considering it's low price, but I was pleasantly surprised! It's made my bed even more comfortable and fits my mattress like a glove. If you don't want to spend a ton of money, I highly recommend it."
4,It fits!,"I liked the price of this mattress pad first of all--then when I received it, it fit my pillow-top bed perfectly. I had a different pad on before that constantly shifted and the edges never stayed put, and this one does! I have enjoyed it. I wasn't looking for fancy, and had I spent more money I may have found one that was a little more ""fluffy"", but this is very functional and in my price range. I had spent more on my last pad that didn't stay put, so I was reluctant to pay very much. I am very satisfied with the purchase."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"With a 2.5 inch foam topper, my mattress is 14 inches deep. This cover, which identities itself as queen size, probably measures an exact 60X80 when stretched and may fit mattresses up to 22"" deep BUT I seriously doubt that it will retain these dimensions after a wash.The top does cover the top of the mattress - barely. The sides do cover the sides of the mattress but there is very little extra fabric to tuck under the mattress. I think the claims of fitting a mattress much deeper than mine are very exaggerated,The quality is fine...all the threads are where they should be but I would have preferred a bit more generosity in terms of fabric - both on the top and the sides - and would have been willing to pay a bit more for that.It's worth the $20 it costs....barely."
2,A non-fitting melty pad....,"Got the pad back in september, and while it did fit better than our past mattress pad it still didn't fit completely. We've got a stupidly thick Englander mattress which this barely fit on the corners (slipped off after a couple of day) and didn't even get close to touching the edges of the bed.Then - it was overdue time to launder, doing so (following directions) provided us with a intact top of the mattress pad, but the underside backing had melted into little hard plastic clumps.Overall, I guess this would be a fine solution for deep mattresses (17""-18"" corners or less) and even better if you had time to air dry, otherwise I'd watch this closely in the dryer to make sure that you don't end up with a clump of polyester."
4,Nice!,"Great pad, great price. I don't like sleeping on something that is too soft, so for me the thickness of this is perfect. Fits the mattress nicely, too."
1,Terrible mattress pad,This is not a mattress pad - it is a mattress cover. It is about as thick as two sets of sheets and is not worth the money - no matter how cheap it is. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Ok for the price - but not on a memory foam mattress,"I recently purchased a luxurious (to me) 12"" memory foam mattress. I absolutely adore it, however I've run into one annoying problem. Regular mattress pads take away from the feel of the memory foam. Without a pad, it is perfect, as you can feel yourself slowly sinking down into the foam (a good thing). But with the 2 mattress pads I've tested so far, the padding removes a lot of the memory foam ""feel"" and the bed becomes much more firm in response.I purchased this pad based on recommendations that it works well with memory foam, but it does a poor job in my opinion. Great for spring mattresses, but look for a thinner pad if you'd like to use it with a memory foam mattress."
4,Damask Stripe Mattress Pad,This isnt as good as I thought it would be... Its not thick enough. But not too bad either.. Better than nothing..
2,Bad design,"This is the second time I have bought a mattress pad where the backing has ""melted"" when I put it in the dryer. I wash my sheets and bedding on hot, and throw everything in the dryer. We have two young boys, so we do a lot of laundry. It is beyond me why a mattress pad wouldn't be COMPLETELY washable and dryable on hot and/or warm settings. I like the top of the pad, which seems like nice quality cotton, and it fits the bed nicely. My complaint is that the backing is poor quality. I didn't order or expect anything waterproof. In fact, I would prefer all cotton. I really don't have time to pack this up and send it back at this point. I am not satisfied and would not buy this type of product online again."
1,A big turnoff,I love Amazon Prime with the fast shipping. This package arrived looking brand new and well packed but with a huge piece of hair on the mattress pad inside the package. You can see it w/o opening the package since it comes in a clear package. A huge turnoff. It just makes one question if these are all returned items. I believe there are laws against this sort of thing when it comes to personal items. What if there are bed bugs on this pad? Do I really want to introduce this to my home? The cost I would incur could be huge.
2,You can do better,"Well, it fits a king sized mattress. Other than that it is not especially soft or comfortable. If you have thin or nice sheets you would want to get a higher quality one. If you sprung for a king sized bed you might as well get a decent mattress pad, which this isn't. The quality and comfort of this pad is more suited for a kids bed or a guest bed that you hope people don't want to use often. The comfort of this item is really unimpressive."
2,"A COVER, not a PAD","The price seems great, and is great- if you're looking for a mattress cover to help protect you mattress. If, however, you were looking for a mattress PAD to add softness and comfort to your original mattress, this is not the correct product. I mistakenly bought this, thinking because it was a ""pad"" it would add padding. It does not. This product is very thin and flat. I'm returning it, and I bought a fiberbed instead."
4,Nice mattress pad,"I bought this pad because of the reviews and I would not change what they say about the product.I have used it for two months now and even it felt much more pad in the beginning, I still notice that it is beneath.If you are looking for a nice but not too expensive pad I would recommend you this product."
3,Too thin,"The size fit perfect, only problem is that it is too thin. If you are looking for thickness then this product is not for you."
4,Comfortable,"This definitely feels nice on the bed. I wouldn't say it's a MUST HAVE, but it does make the bed just fee a little softer, and that's always a good thing. Fits well, plenty of space to spare. I hope it holds up after some washings."
5,good,Perfect!!! I bought this for my boyfriend. He like it very much. I like Tommy Hilfiger so much. Good Good
5,Good Sleeping,"I was looking for a replacement for our worn out, shredding, mattress pad when I came across this one. I read a ton of the reviews and decided to buy it for us. It works well and doesn't make us sweat uncontrollably like some of the rubber back ones do. I haven't washed it yet but when I do I will post again. Overall an excellent purchase and works just like it was meant to."
1,The Worst Mattress Pad - Do Yourself a favor - DON'T BUY,"This is the worst mattress pad, the fabric is hard and poor quality! The backside has some gunk attached to it."
5,Mattress cover,This mattress cover is everything I expected it to be. The fit ws perfect and the quality was very good.
3,"Good, but not perfect","Bought this for my sons' dorm room bed, fits well on the extra long bed and does the job of adding some thickness to the mattress, but still moves around on the bed. Easy to wash & dry. Good value for money. Could spend more on something from potterybarn, but this does the job just fine."
5,Great mates cover for a great price!,"very comfortable and beautiful, quality fabric, fits snugly on our 10"" mattress without being too stretched out or to loose, No excess saggy fabric on the sides but could even fit over thicker mattresses. Perfect, would buy it again in a heartbeat."
2,Nice cotton top but poor quality underneath.,"The cotton damask top is nice and the elastic side material is durable but after a few machine-washes using regular laundry detergent (no bleach), the polyester material under the cotton top has begun to deteriorate."
1,Do Not Buy This product,"I read the negative reviews and still bought this mattress pad. I washed it once, put it on low dry and it still melted.Who is going to line dry their mattress pad these days? the other option is not to wash it and that's just gross.I returned it the next day. No problem. good customer service. Bad product."
2,Disappointing,Goal was to buy a high quality cotton pad to insulate me from the heat of my pillow top mattress. First disappointment was this is primarily polyester so it doesn't insulate at all. It's the hottest mattress pad I've owned. Second disappointment was the dismal gray color it turned the first time I washed it. I washed it alone with detergent and a little chlorine-free bleach and it turned gray! It looks awful. One of the upsides of this pad was it was pretty but not any more. The only remaining upside is the sides are really deep. It's a joy to put on because I don't have to struggle and stretch to get it over my deep mattress.
5,wonderful product,i purchased this product to use with my new king size mattress that we just purchased and i am extremely satisfied with it . it fits perfect with no wrinkles or bunching up . just a perfect fit and it sleeps so much better with this mattress pad and also protecting my new mattress and hopefully will get much better service and long use with using the mattress cover . i would def recommend this to everyone who wants a good nites sleep and mattress protection.
3,Watch out how you wash this,"This was a wonderful mattress cover. Until, my husband trying to help me washed it. The backing melted, and he only dried it on medium. So, if you buy this, make sure a. not to let a husband wash it and b. use no heat drying method. Other than that I liked it."
5,Best value for a mattress pad.,This is the second of these mattress pad's that I have bought. I love them both. High quality. Comfortable. Fit well on any mattress. And a great price!
5,Absolutely fantastic,"I just purchased the foam mattress topper and a quilt covering. Very easy to setup and the first night sleep was absolutely fantastic. My back pain was improved and did not feel the stiffness like I usually feel with my original mattress. It is very firm and molds to your body. To complement the foam topper, I also purchased the foam pillows and relieved the pain in my neck. My wife also told me that she slept better and relieved her back and neck pain as well. This is really a cost saving way compared to purchasing a good quality mattress. The foam itself practically had no odor and both my wife and I did not feel hot sleeping on the foam topper. I give it ***** and recommend it to everyone."
1,Melted - Even With LOW Heat,"I purchased this item only 1 month ago. On my first wash, it was dried on low and a small bit of the inner liner began to melt. I just washed it today for its 2nd time and the entire inside liner is completely melted. I used the lowest heat setting on my drier both times. This item is extremely poor quality and I would recommend everyone to look elsewhere."
4,Probably the Best Deal for an Inexpensive Pad,"I washed mine before using (gentle cycle, warm; tumble dry low) and it came out just fine and fits the bed.The underside of the pad is polyester nonwoven ""fabric"" like what cheap reusable shopping bags are made of. I took away a star for that because my experience is that that stuff is not very durable.Aside from that, these pads look great. Not super plush but enough filling to keep most things off your mattress. The ""skirt"" is a soft fabric and looks very generous. We don't have super deep mattresses so that's not an issue for us personally. The pad stays put on the bed.I am very pleased with this purchase and don't think you can get more bang for your buck. I am honestly clueless as to where the bad reviews are coming from. Fakes? Competitors?"
1,Why didn't I trust the reviews?,"Well...it's my own fault really...I didn't read the reviews and bought this mattress pad anyway. It arrived quickly and seemed like a really nice mattress pad. As with any bedding...I always wash it before using it on my bed. I washed the mattress pad on cool wash/cold rinse, then dried it for about 15 minutes on low-heat. Pulled it out of the dryer to discover that the entire back was melted. It's completely destroyed and I haven't even used it yet. I'm in the process of returning it. I knew the low price was too good to be true.I've now taken the time to read more of the reviews on this product. What I don't understand is why Amazon continues to sell this product? In all the years I've been shopping with Amazon, this is the first time I've experienced a poorly constructed product."
1,Melts When Dried According to Instructions,"As reported in other reviews, mine melted the first time I tried to dry it, even following the instructions on the tag. The plastic particles ruined set of sheets in the same load and even a shirt in the next load. Given that the tag on it even provides dryer instuctions, I just can't recommend this mattress pad to anyone."
2,pretty poor quality,"This is supposed to fit up to a 21"" mattress. Wrong. The workmanship is so poor it doesnt even have an elastic bottom to tuck it in. The overstuffed top is nearly none existant. Do yourself a favor dont order this. I cant wait to return it."
4,Mattress Pad,Very soft and comfortable. It is a little deep for my regular size twin mattress but tucks in well. I like the fabric on the sides. It's much better than the gauzy type found on some mattress pads.
1,Melts in Dryer!!!!,Do not buy this mattress pad! It melts in your dryer at any setting!!!! Don't buy this mattress pad!!! Do not buy!!!!
2,Won't Stay in Place,"The padding doesn't even cover the whole mattress on top, and the mesh isn't snug so the whole thing slides. So disappointed."
3,your average mattress pad,This was purchased based on the Amazon good reviews. I was expecting more. It's an average thickness and average quality mattress pad just like those found everyday at Walmart for around $10.00.
3,Good qualiity,The quality is good but we have a tempurpedic mattress and all other pads have slipped off at the top. We suspect it now to be the mattress.
1,"Barely fits over a 14"" deep mattress","I just received this today and put it on my bed after shaking it to fluff it a little. My mattress is X-long twin and 14 inches deep, which includes the pillow top. I've measured the mattress several times, so I'm absolutely certain of its depth. This brand new and purportedly wonderful pad is extremely tight on the mattress, and I'm floored at the claims that it would, in anyone's wildest imagination, fit up to a 22 inch deep mattress. It was quite difficult for two of us to even get the wretched thing on the bed initially, and the bottom of the pad skirt doesn't reach to the lower edge of the mattress. Heaven forbid I'd wash and dry it -- the shrinkage would be ridiculous. Altogether, this was a huge disappointment and I'm sending it back as soon as I can get my return label printed."
4,Surprisingly comfortable,"I used to sleep on memory foam mattress, but after getting a king-sized bed it became too expensive to buy a king-sized foam mattress. I bought this one because I needed a cheap alternative and expected it to be uncomfortable. However, although definitely less soft than the memory foam, it is actually very good and I haven't had troubles sleeping on it. I'll recommend it to people who need a soft mattress pad for a short period of time."
3,Was a decent price but ...,"sheets are rough. Nice design. Pleasant to look at. Seem relatively sturdy (like they will be put through the washer many times at college, lol) Fit the XL twin mattress perfectly."
1,DO NOT BUY unless you never intend to wash it !,"I read the reviews and noted that there had been some problems with the underside batting melting in the dryer after washing. The item arrived and looked very promising. As I do all fabric that I wear or sleep on, I promptly washed it on a gentle cycle. Then placed it (by itself) in the dryer under VERY LOW HEAT for DELICATE fabric. Guess what ? It still MELTED !! Returned for refund."
2,You get what you pay for...,Not nearly as cushy as the picture / description appears. I was really hoping it had a bit more fluff.
5,"GOOD, SOFT.",Length:: 1:22 MinsHERE IS A QUICK VIDEO < I MADE SINCE I FELT THAT THE DEFAULT PICS DIDN'T CONVINCE ABOUT THE PRODUCT.
2,Not such a deal,I haven't even gotten as far as opening the package and already know that I was taken. The product description on Amazon says this item lists for $70.00 new. Ha! Says right on the manufacturer's packaging that list was $24.99. I'm tempted to send it back for that reason alone... Seems like bait and switch to me.
1,If you're cold at night. . .,"The polyester fill was too hot for us, and we purchased another cotton filled replacement."
2,You get what you pay for.,I purchased this Deluxe 100% Cotton Damask Stripe Mattress Pad thinking it would be a great bargain since the stated list price was $70 and the price I paid was only $21 but I found that you get what you pay for. The mattress pad is so thin and lightweight that it's almost like putting a blanket beneath the sheet. I am disappointed with the flimsy pad but kept it anyway. I'll buy the next item like this in a store where I can actually feel the quality instead of just assume it's a good one.
1,Sending back - melted after laundering per instructions,"After one washing (low temp settings, per instructions), the under-side of the quilted top melted! I am very disappointed and sending this back."
2,mattress cover,"Purchased a Mattress quilted Cover which was rip on the left side on arrival, I did not now how to return the item b/c I got rid of the box with the instruction, this is the first item that I purchase that I'm not 100% satisfied;"
3,Careful what is recommended,"This item was recommended to go along with the memory foam mattress pad I ordered. The problem was that the mattress pad was king sized, but the recommended mattress cover was queen sized."
4,Very good value for the price,"We've had this mattress pad for several months, and have been very satisfied with it. It's not the thickest mattress pad I've seen but it's far better than adequate, and the construction quality (stitching and such) gives me nothing to complain about. (It's a mattress pad, how exciting can it be?)I was concerned about reviews that said the mattress pad would fall apart in the wash. As a result, I used a gentle cycle and low heat (as I do with items marked delicate) and have had no problems.At this low price point, the mattress pad is a bargain."
2,Thin Pad,"This mattress pad is barely noticeable. It is very thin, with little material inside. I don't even notice a difference with it on."
3,only ok - not worth more than $25,"This mattress pad is not the cheapest I've seen, but it's only a few steps in quality above the cheapest pads that I've seen. The word 'deluxe' is being used very loosely here. I had read all of the positive reviews and was expecting something better. It's pretty ho-hum. The stitching on one part started to come loose after the first wash even though I washed this on a gentle cycle/delicate dryer cycle. I'm on the verge of returning this.It is BARELY worth the $25 price that Amazon is selling it for - there is no way this pad is worth the 'original' price amazon is quoting as $60."
4,Great value,This is a great mattress pad for the money. Even nicer than more expensive pads I've purchased in the past.
5,Very nice,"The top of the mattress pad is nicely padded and it fits my mattress (cal-king memory foam) perfectly. Much nicer than my old mattress pad. One of the few things that I've purchased recently that actually *didn't* smell funky and chemically right out of the bag, was a nice surprise."
4,Good Bargin,Very nice and well padded. Fit our pillow top bed very well. Does not slip off. Very good quality.
5,it be good,"it be good, honestly I do not have much to say about this. I put it on the mattress and covered it with my bed sheets. what else can i possibly say. maybe when I wash it, it may fall apart but right now I can honestly say that it be good. Live long and prosper people."
3,SOFT PROTECTOR,"Very soft, well fitted even on a thick mattress. The only complain i have is that it is not waterproof (i bought if fot my 3 year old). Nice price!"
3,"For twenty bucks, I guess it's ok","I have no idea how thick my mattress is so this review is limited.I loved how it fit my mattress perfectly. So perfectly that trying to get it over the corners were a bit tough. On one corner when I tried to pull it off, I suppose I shouldn't have been so rough because I split open the seams a bit. Well, I guess that's alright, I mended it back up, no problem. It was stretchy enough to accommodate my foam topper (which was 1 & 5/8 in.). The thing I didn't like too much was when my bed sheet... 'stuck' to it.. in other words, you could see the quilted pattern of this mattress pad.So, I wouldn't say I'm extremely pleased or disappointed in it, more of a 'eh, it'll do' about it."
5,Love it....Just wash and air dry....Duh!,"This is the second one I've purchased! I bought one for my bed and loved it so much that I bought one for my son! I see all the reviews that say this melts in the dryer so I just washed mine and let it air dry! It was perfect! I love the material on the sides, it's this cool sleek stretchy material that seems quite strong to me! My son and I both have pillowtop mattresses that are quite thick and this covers with no problem. I think it helps sheets stay on the mattress better and I have never felt that it generates heats like one reviewer commented. I've told everyone about this mattress cover and it is an awesome price when you can catch it marked down!"
4,good quality mattress pad,This meets my needs for a twin XL mattress pad. The size is hard to find. The quality of the mattress pad is good for the price.
5,"Great product, great price",Very impressed with this product considering the cost. Did great in the laundry and has jut enough padding to add a bit of softness without being too soft. Would buy again!
4,Thick enough for a matress pad,"This is thick enough for a mattress pad and comes at a great price. But it won't make a world of difference for your mattress. You're better off buying a mattress topper, but if you just want to add a little bit of softness then this will do the trick."
2,Too general - No details for sizing or installation,Note the title!! It does not give any details on how to size a system or the types of equipment available. It's really for a builder to keep some general things in mind.It does give some good tips on ductwork layout...that's all
1,I could have written this book,"This book contains very little technical information on designing a residential HVAC system.I am building my own house and bought this book with hopes of using it to guide me through designing installing my HVAC system.I expected to find furnace sizing info, duct sizing info, routing techniques, etc.....None of it was in there. NONE.It has been pretty much useless.It explains the very basics, but anyone could gain the same info by walking through their own and a few of their friends houses and looking at their heating/cooling systems.This book might be good for someone who has never seen a residential HVAC system, but not for anybody who is handy and does most of their own projects at home.You'll find more info on doing HVAC duct design by going to Home Depot and grabbing one of those ""How to"" cheat sheets that they put up next to the furnace duct racks."
5,"The definition of ""girl power"".","""A Powerful Noise"" is one of those movies where after you watch it, you just want to tell everyone you know about it. ..And that's exactly what I'm doing.It's a film about empowering women & girls and inspiring them to get educated about the spread of HIV/AIDS.The film follows three women from three different countries, Mali, Vietnam and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and shows as they help women in their countries make changes in their lives. They strive to make a difference in lives of these women by showing them how imperative it is to learn about the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS.It's a great documentary that simply inspires its audience to reach out to their communities, and remain hopeful for change."
3,It's a test Book and you cant print tests....,Hey the book is a good tool im happy with content. It's a bunch of test questions to help you learn the material. The problem is i got it for my Kindle Fire. Printing from the kindle fire is possible but a pain in the Rump. Get the real book and save your self the headache!!!!
3,It is an okay tool.,I didn't get as much out of this as I had hoped for but since I did learn some things it's not a total loss!
3,Why Not ATTM Included?,"why wasn't ""A Toast To Men"" included on the soundtrack?the song playing during when eve was doing yoga on the beach!that's a #1 hit...so why it ain't on here?!"
2,Issac's song so sad its not featured on the soundtrack,I too like all of u searched for that cool little jam that plays while issac is showing off in the barbershop well here it is I have found it and guess what? Its here availible on amazon.com ! The song is : Lose your mind by Bubba Sparxxx and its track #3 on the CD titled: Back in the Mud (cd single ).
2,Typical problem when buying music,"The sequel is not as good as the first, but still pretty good. The soundtrack is fairly average in the way that only 2 or 3 songs (out of 15) are worth listening to. One of the good things that I have recently discovered about Amazon.com with regard to music, is that you can listen to a 30 second snippet of each song. That could have caused me to rethink my purchase."
2,Song while Isaac is showing off...,"In response to someone's previous question.the name of the song while Isaac is cutting hair (and cuts an ""i"" in the back of that dude's head) is ""i'm back"" by marshall mathers"
3,Barbershop 2,"The first 4 tracks are dope. However, the rest of the album isn't that good. Nonetheless, it's difficult to find an album with four or five good tracks on it these days. Especially when you are dealing with a ""soundtrack"". I was somewhat dissapointed that Ice Cube did not come with atleast one song of his own. Overall it was ok."
2,Aight I guess,"Mary J's track is pretty good, but how can you have a Barbershop 2 soundtrack without a single track from stars Ice Cube, Eve, or Queen Latifah!!!"
4,good stuff,"This was a good CD but some of the songs in the film aren't on the soundtrack like that Tupac song. But the song that goes ""never too much"" at the end is on the soundtrack its never by keyshia cole feat. Eve."
3,Tupac Song.,"I am just reponding to the question about Tupac. The song is Thug N U Thug N Me (remix). It IS an awesome song, and it is on the film but not the soundtrack, to listen to it you need Tupac's ""Until The End Of Time"" CD."
2,"To ""a music fan""--the ""no rap until after 12pm song""","With the help of my son, I found out that the song is called ""thug in u thug in me"" by tupac. The album is called ""Until the End of Time"". I liked the song, too, which is what made me look for it on the Barbershop 2 soundtrack."
4,"Broad coverage of subject, yet very little practical value","This is the most frustrating Y2K remediation text I have purchased to date. The forms provided are not real-world useful, but the concepts presented on software testing are right on the money. Could anyone tell me where I can locate the Marilyn Frankel/Carl Gehr Edge/GUIDE report on Y2K tools, and the supposed 600 page free tool guide from the USAF mentioned on page 462 of the book, and referred to on the back cover?rhawk@celestica.com, RHawk74059@aol.comI've searched the web for information on these documents with no luck.THANKS"
2,Its the price!,"I really think I would like the book judging by the reviews. However, $18.50 for bytes over the air--you've got to be kidding! No paper, no binding, no printing, just brilliant ideas, but I simply cannot justify that much money for an e-book. Help me out here, please!"
3,Everyday with Paul,"Wonderful references to Ephesus - having been there, we enjoyed the thoughts in the book even more."
2,"Call him the ""Jock-o-nator""","Not only did he completely imitate Elvis to the point where I can barely tell the difference (and I KNOW Elvis), but he sang Elvis' songs like a year later! Suspicion, Pocket Full of Rainbows, Kiss Me Quick....all songs the King recorded a year or two earlier. He should be ashamed."
3,"Pleasant, but nothing extraordinary","The first of Gliere's three symphonies is pleasant but not very memorable. Like most early works of other composers, Gliere's Symphony No. 1 shows the influence of his predecessors/mentors (in this case Tchaikovsky and Ippolitov-Ivanov). Nevertheless. listening to Symphony No. 1 can provide an interesting contrast to the monumental Symphony No. 3 (""Il'ya Murometz""). The intriguing symphonic poem ""The Sirens"" is a bit of a ""make-weight"" on this CD (the CD's total time is just less than 50 minutes) that evokes the sea and the allure of the sirens who are beneath the waves.The Slovak Philharmonic Orchestra and Stephen Gunzenhauser give these pieces a good go and hardly diminish the qualities of the music."
3,This is a CHILD's book!!!,"For all practical purposes, anyway. It should have been made more plain in the description. Yes, it was cute, and sweet, and it made me cry for the cat that I just lost. But it also took me all of 5 minutes to read, and was $10!!!I am very disappointed in this, and it should have been explained that it was a coffee-table type or tiny child's book.I might have spent it to comfort a friend or for a gift. But I would not have spent that for myself. I am VERY disappointed in this transaction. Sorry."
3,Comforting during the time of loss...........,"Although this book does provide comfort to young children during the loss of a pet cat I am concerned about the authors choice of words which seems to imply reincarnation. I do not know if this was the intent but it does concern me.Our little Digit was a part of our family for 12 years and she will always be my ""forever cat""; but, when she came into my life I never felt that we had ""been together before, in a far away place and a long ago time "".My daughter seems to be comforted by this book at our time of loss but I do not think I would have purchased this if I had known this before hand."
4,A great help for Parents and Families,"Vickie is a godsend for those of us with Dyspraxic children. We've used this to introduce ideas and approaches with family and friends, as well as, gain a deeper understanding of this challange from the stance of the affected. Although the writting is sometimes a little quirky it's a funny and easy look into the life of the dyspraxic."
3,I think The Midwich Cuckoos was an interesting book.,"The Midwich Cuckoos was a fun, scientific like book. I feel that it could be a little more scary than it really was expected."
1,Kindle Version full of typos,The Kindle version of The Midwich Cuckoos is full of typos. I am annoyed by the fact that the first four chapters which are available as a free sample have only one error and that is at the very end of the sample. The errors start after that. I read the sample and decided it looked ok. This version is unacceptable.
2,Review of The Midwich Cuckoos,"The book is what I wanted. Unfortunately, there were too many typo errors. The main problem was that sentences with 'I or 'A would remove the space between it and the next word. Hence ""'I can"" would appear as ""'Ican"". It needs someone to manually go through the book searching for the 2 combinations, and insert the space where appropriate."
4,Sparrows and Cuckoos,"This is a book about survival of a species facing the prospect of being replaced by a more ""fit"" competitor. Despite somewhat outdated descriptions of genetics and biological evolution, Wyndham's premise is compelling: civilized conventions and moral niceties hardly apply when your species is targeted for extinction as a necessary step in the survival of a competing species. The mysterious Children of Midwich, all conceived on the same day, represent an unprecedented, and insidious threat to the residents of Midwich and, ultimately, to the human species. Are they the hatchlings of an unknown cuckoo species? If so, can we human sparrows realistically rear them as our beloved children and survive? Wyndham has the answer."
4,"A good, old fashioned horror","This book is one-of-a-kind horror which scares in an almost intimate way. It gets to know the reader and then lets him/her have it, with the full force of Wyndum's talent. It shakes up reality a little. A great piece of writing."
5,Grad student's best friend.,"I am already a grad student/pack mule carrying my books, laptop, and various other obligatory crap, but having a small reference that is is easily transported from practicum site to practicum site makes my trek from the student parking lot all the way to the hospital complex soooo much more pleasant. Very convenient!WORD OF WARNING!!! If you are a student that needs the DSM for a course, be forewarned that this is an abbreviated version and DOES NOT have all the description, etiology, and background on disorders that the full DSM has. This book is meant for quick reference to diagnostic criteria, specifiers, and codes; however, it is important to have a full grasp of the information in the full DSM (it was included for a reason) before using a book like this."
5,The Only DSM That You Need,"This is a modest little book that you can fit into your pocket but it does everything that its big brother (the much more expensive, full version of the DSM IV-TR) does -- at half the price and with greater ease of use. While the unabridged DSM IV is pretty much a textbook of psychiatry, minus only treatment recommendations, this abridgement unpretentiously lists just the diagnostic categories and the relevent (concisely phrased) criteria. Professionals will find it a handy source of symptoms and diagnosis for insurance purposes. Non-professionals will find it usable for the purpose of diagnosing themselves, their spouse, their parents and problematic friends."
5,very helpful,The reference guide is very helpful when I don't want to carry around the large DSM. It still has most of the information you need in it and is much much smaller.
5,Very Handy for a college student...,"Small, yet concise. Perfect for someone who needs the info without having to lug around the fullsize edition which is as big as a telephone book."
5,DSM,This is a wonderful book for anyone in the psychiatry field. It's a great reference to have in your pocket and is simple to learn from. This is a must have!
5,Inquiry,Inquiry if this Quick Reference SDM-IV-TR is available sprial-bound.Our nurses have used spiral-bound in the past & prefer this style. Can you get it for us.Please reply. Didn't know where else to inquire re: this.Thank you for your assistance.
5,DSM,"I needed this for a class. It mets my expectations, and arrived very quickly. I am pleased with my order."
3,"I knew a new, updated version had just been approved",Fine for my non-clinical purposes in dealing with people who have disability/behavioral issues. This helps me figure out how to better serve their needs
5,DSM IV TR,This book is a must for diagnosing. I enjoy the small pocket size. I needed a new one because I wore my other one out. Good price.
5,Brief and useful,This book is in pocket size. Easy to carry in the purse. Is very brief and precise.
3,a couple of problems,"In order to understand the movie, one has to be quite familiar with French history, especially during the reign of Louis XIV, including the background information on Lully, Robert Cambert, Moliere, Prince de Conti; otherwise, the plot and conversation could be very confusing. One of my biggest problems with this movie is that many characters were cast TOO OLD! Cambert (1628-1677) was only 4 years older than Lully (1632-1687), and yet the actor who played Cambert looks old enough to be the father of Boris Terral (who played Lully) and actually was already 50 year old when the film was shot! The actor who played ""Prince de Conti"" was already 56 while his character should be a twentyish or thirtyish young man! Same with Moliere. Couldn't the director find some younger French-speaking acotrs?But if you like French Baroque music and court dance, then this movie might be for you."
4,Simplified but still really good,"Louis XIV was the most capable monarch of his, or perhaps any, generation. The artistic grandeur of his court is legendary. The film, like most about La Grand Monarch, is rather simplistic. However the performances, musically and dramatically, are well worth the viewing. Do not bother with the English dubbed version. The original French is best. Just remember that Lully was only one in a thousand important relationships Louis had in his 70+ years on the throne."
4,An unusual movie however well worth watching,I saw preview on YouTube and found it interesting. After buying the movie I found that it did not disappoint me. It was entertaining and had lots of music.
5,A must to see.,"A masterpiece. A must to see. Fabulous. Marvellous. Fantastic.One of the best movies i've ever seen.If you like ancient music, you won't regret it."
2,Like college freshmen corousing,"We previously got the sound track, which was wonderful.We were hoping to see some dancing, but there was very little and very strange. We got to see some acrobatic exhibition dance, but none of the french court dance, which everyone at the court was expected to do well.It's impossible to believe that people would behave in such a frantic and out of control manner in the French court. No manner how talented they were.There are many unbelievable things. For example, female singing roles were still played by young men with high voices. Didn't the director remember the movie Farinelli, which he himself directed?Very disappointing, and we had such high hopes."
2,put your seat belt on,"If you're a fan of kinky sex, bathroom fun, S & M, and humiliating sex, this is YOUR book. Not my idea of ""erotic"" stories. Little romance offered for my wife, and not much for me either. Found 2 stories interesting, most was not to our liking. Mostly leans toward S & M activities, so if thats ur bag, this is your book."
2,"Well, it looked nice enough to buy...","...but sadly it didn't keep my interest. There were perhaps two stories out of the considerably sized book that even perked my interest. It may be because I didn't feel the stories got along well enough and the sex, well, left me flat more times than not. Erotica should sizzle, not be a limp noodle..."
2,boring,man if I wanted something this boring I would have rented the movie the notebook. book doesn't show any true promise...I mean where is the excitement and drama invovled.
1,bad stories,"I should have listened to the reviews. This book is bad. The stories are WAY too long. Some of them are just over the top full of S&M, others ramble on for pages about things not even remotely related to Erotic. I like me the occasional S&M story, but this was just too much, and instead of turning me on, it left me way cold. There has got to be better stuff out there, so when you find it, make sure to buy that instead."
3,Misleading Compat,"This is a pretty sound little device, and all in all, I'm satisfied with it. I'm a little annoyed that on all the online product descriptions I read before deciding on this item, MicroSD (a.k.a. Transflash) was listed as one of its working formats. Turns out it's compatible with Micro only by using an external SD adapter (not included with this device, but included with virtually all MicroSD cards). Considering that I purchased this item to replace a sleeker and more portable SD drive, so I wouldn't have to deal with the Micro|SD adapter, discovering that I've ""upgraded"" to an inferior device is somewhat annoying.As for the device itself, it's okay. It has no problems, but I can only rate it around three stars because -- for the features it has -- there are better items out there: more compact, front-forward design, sturdier, no goofy movie emblem stuck to it, etc."
4,Memories of the Good Old Days,"If you are a child of the sixties, you will remember Baby Washington's rendition of ""The Bells"". This and ""Time"" were two of her best songs. All of the songs on this cd will send you back to prom night in your mind. Get your aging baby boomer buddies together, break out a bottle of wine, and drift down memory lane with this cd."
3,CD Review,"Product arrived in a timley manner, in good shape. While only looking for one song, this was a fairly good complation of her music."
5,Nice book,The seller was very accurate in his description of this Civil War book. The shipping was fast and the packaging was great.
5,Good book for children,"My 3 year old son found this book in his preschool and couldn't put it down! So I bought it in the amazon marketplace. The book is thin, hardcover, but very informative. Lots of pictures, and good descriptions. I learn quite a bit from the book too. The page my son enjoy the most is the one showing all the dolphins and whales together in proportion to each other, so you have a good idea how big they are comparing to each other. Highly recommend."
5,Excellent documentary,Video quality is perfect and the scenery makes you want to go there and experience for yourself the beauty of nature in the area. The narrative is also very well composed.
4,Would buy again,This was a little difficult to figure out in the beginning - Actually had to read the instructions - but it was very fun and very disney. Fam loves it.
1,Be Aware of References to the Occult!,"We were expecting a nice Disney game with characters like Mickey Mouse, Goofy, etc. We weren't expecting references to the Occult. If this bothers you, then this is NOT the version for your family. We returned this game."
4,Holly in some of her best acting,"Holly Hunter and Stellan Skarsgaard (sp?) in a very underrated historical drama. A fine story though it seems that as a production of one of the Movie Channels it lacked budget and therefore some production values were lost. Still and all, it is a good story and I think some of Holly Hunter's finest acting. You just fall in love with her as Ruby.It ranks a little below Matewan as union movies go, but it is still one of the better ones. Too bad one of the big film studios didn't pick this one up to make.Had to have this one for my collection."
4,Locale and dialect ring true,"We watched this movie in our College 101 class. The movie was about the Brookside Coal Miners going on strike in Harlan County, Kentucky. The coal miners held the strike for safety, better housing, and benefits. I am an Appalachian and the dialect is accurate for the way we informally talk. The apparel closely resembles the clothing of that time. The movie was amazing and so was Holly Hunter. I would recommend this movie to everyone. ---- Jessica Bryant and Ashley Perdue (Cantrell students)"
2,Fragile--not good for a toy,"Our son loves Mater so I bought two of these after reading the reviews. Within two days both had lost a wheel and the teeth detached from one of them. The side mirrors and hook are flimsy plastic and will probably break soon too. They had been knocked off a coffee table, or dropped accidentally, but every other kid toy seems to be built with this eventuality in mind and holds up. I would not recommend this toy for a child that is in any way rough on toys. I only hope the super glue holds them together long enough for him to move on to something else."
2,"Hot Wheels, they're not!","Good as collectables, not so good as actual toys that you play with.My daugter has broken the hook off of Mater (bought her a new one), broken the wheel off of Dynaco McQueen, and broken the front axle off of the tractor. Mater's tow equipment is made with a softer cheaper plastic than the rest of the toy, and I expect the new one to break any day now.Without being too sexist, I want to point out that my 4 year old daughter is probably more gentle on them than the average boy playing with them. They have never entered a sandbox. They have not been stood on, nor thrown, nor been monster-trucked by a bicycle.While I will still probably buy more, as my daughter loves the Cars movie and wants to own them all, (including Frank, which they do not make) I would say to all: buyer beware!"
2,Not durable,"I'm very upset with the quality of these Disney Cars toy cars! These break so easily. My son has had Mater for only 3 months and its already starting to break. The mirrors on the side are falling off. Having the same problem with the ""Mac"" truck he got at the same time. I've had to return several Disney Cars products bought on this site because they literally broke after being used one or two times. Disney - so disappointed with your Cars products!"
1,shame on Mattel,"Before you purchase Cars or any other Mattel product, please consider Mattel relies on Indonesia's rain-forests for it's packaging and is putting endangered Orang-utans and Tigers at risk. Indonesia's last remaining Orangutans and Tiger rely on this habitat and will surely vanquish for the earth forever if this process does not stop; all for the sake a toy packaging, rediculous. Please protest Mattel and choose a more environmentally sustainable toy for your children until Mattel agrees to discontinue this horrible, needless practice."
3,Good Enough,"For some reason I don't understand, my nephew's favorite toy is little Mater.I really have no idea why. But hey, it works.The toy is durable enough, but my nephew can break everything that isn't a lego. So you get what you pay for..."
4,Tow Mater Toy Truck,Length:: 2:42 MinsThis is a video review of the Tow Mater Toy Truck by Mattel. Originally reviewed for ToysforJunior.com
5,My son love's this toy!,"My son is a huge Cars fan so I ordered this as a surprise gift. Mater has held up pretty well after much abuse from a preschooler. The only downside is that Mater's hook to tow cars is a little delicate and may not be able to withstand much more abuse. However, I doubt that would be an issue if this car was a gift/toy for an older child."
4,The color is off,"My son has most of these cars in his collection now and I must say almost all of them look like they are right out of the movie. The manufacturer dropped the ball a little with Mater. The color isn't right. The actual Mater in the movie has that worn rustic look, this Mater looks like new rust brown colored paint. They should have also made the hook so it can be played with the other cars. Toys should be built as toys to be played with rather than the intention of people buying them only as intended collectors items being the goal.Better than your average cheap toy, these have some weight to them and feel like quality products. My local retail stores have these for less money, even before any additional shipping cost is added on, however trying to obtain specific cars for my 3 year olds collection that he wanted were easier to find on Amazon so the $1 or $2 extra I paid I probably saved in gas from driving around store to store looking for them."
4,Terrific Debut Collection,"I own this collection in trade paperback. It introduced the horror genre to a literate, gripping new voice from Ireland named Kealan Patrick Burke. Solid writing, disturbing and sleek. This is a great read for fans of genuinely creepy stories."
3,Its an OK book,"The whole purpose of the book is to teach you to be proactive, basically. You might like it more than me though..."
2,So What's New?,Not much in here that hasn't already been stated in many other places. Very basic coverage of the issue of change.
4,Very tasty and effective.,"This tastes very great. It is a little more citrus like in taste than the P90x original recovery drink, but about 20 bucks cheaper so economically I will stay with this. I have tried Mike's Mix too the original vanilla flavor which is very great tasting, but I wanted to switch to something else and I will likely stay with this for awhile.But as I said you can't go wrong with this. It does though seem to have a slightly bitter after taste which doesn't linger too long but I'd rather do without it. I would consider trying the fruit punch flavor perhaps on my next order. But a great product overall."
5,"good quality item, fast delivery 100% recommended","This product is part of my training routine to improve my physical performance, if you want better results try this product ... 100% recommended"
2,You haven't missed anything if you've seen the movie.,You can tell that Crichton was writing this just hoping it would become a big movie.
2,watch the movie instead,"a bad book from a good writer.tom sanders works at a computer company where he gets sexually harassed by his ex-lover,now his boss,.nobody believes that he got harassed by a woman and the drama unfolds.he sues her and blah,blah,blah.not a good book."
1,"Gripping, but it hurts people who are really harassed.","I work in this field (sexual harassment education and cases), and while MC is correct on his details, the overall atmosphere in the book is detrimental to progress in society in this area. The villianess is the archetype of the false accuser that men focus on in my training sessions. In practice, in every case I've been able to investigate (some reports I hear about I can't investigate, e.g., because the accuser just wants to vent in confidence) the complainant's accusation has been supported. I'm sure there are some Merediths out there, but they are few and far between. Given that this may be the only knowledge many people have about sexual harassment it is a shame there wasn't at least a subplot that was more typical. Re the writing,as usual MC can really move it along. All the more shame the message wasn't more proactive."
1,a very dull book,the following book by the master of sci-fi was wonderful to begin with .but in the second half it was very dull. I found the story anti-climactic
1,One of only a few books I've ever thrown away after reading.,"The implication of the politics of this book are extremely problematic. Let's all pay attention to the (almost non-existent) female to male harrassment, and ignore the all-too-common male to female variety. Don't we all feel bad for Michael Douglas? Yeah, harrassment isn't really an issue of violence against women. Don't we all feel better now?What a load of crap."
3,Sexual Power - Reversed,"This is a very good book, but the main male character is slightlyhard to believe. His ""Political Correctness"" throughout thebook are extreme. If a few more naturally ""male"" characteristicswould have been present, this book would have been much more powerful.The character in the movie was much more believable.Overall, though, this book is very good."
4,Crichton fan,Not Michael Crichton's best work but still entertaining and worth the read. Purchased for my kindle and it was a quick and easy transaction.
5,DISCLOSURE by Michael Crichton,"An intelligent, hard working, successful, family man, executive for a Seattle based division of a California Silicon Valley digital company, falsely falls victim to his beautiful and calculating new female boss. Interestingly, ten years prior to this happening, they had had an intimate relationship before going their separate ways. For reasons not immediately apparent to the reader, she knowingly sets him up for a sexual harassment accusation. This is only where this complex Michael Crichton plot begins as the readers are taken through a potential merger of two diverse corporations. Along the way, readers move through an intriguing digital journey they won't soon forget. This novel, along with his other work, gives Michael Crichton a perpetual audience for the ages."
4,At last...,"..a book about a sexually harrassed man! I wonder how many men have actually been sexually harrassed out in the business world but have been too embarrassed to step forward for fear of ridicule from their fellow employee's? Michael Crichton handled this situation wonderfully showing how one man's world is knocked upside down because of such a happening. My simple review for this book is, whether you're a man or woman who's had a similar problem, read this book!!! It's exceptionally written."
2,Not Impressed,"If you are looking for a good Michael Crichton novel I would stay clear of this one. I found the plot line was very boring, which seemed only to develop significantly in the last quarter of the book. I feel I was waiting for things to happen the whole time I was reading and nothing ever really did. The characters were boring and not too bright. I guessed what the ending was at the beginning of the book. This is nothing like his other books which are very good, and being a big Michael Crichton fan I was disappointed."
5,BY FAR MY FAVORITE CRICHTON,"I have read every Crichton book there is, and Disclosure was last but not least. Usually, I can't read a book in one night or a day or two. I will read consistently every night and finish the book in a week or two. However, Disclosure was finished in about a day and a half- very fast for me. The book kept my interest more than any other Crichton, more than any other book for that matter! Crichton made it really easy to hate the enemies of the book and love the heroes. A must read? YES!"
2,Disclosure,"I found it difficult to follow the technical part of this book. Had I had a better understanding, I think I might have enjoyed the book more."
5,A really good book,"Even though it was written almost twenty years ago, the tech stuff was still interesting. Things don't change much, they just get newer. The characters were very interesting, and the story was still fresh. I guess things don't change with people, either, they just get older. It was a little raw in places, but it always seemed real. I've seen a bunch of movies based on his books, I may start reading them. This was an interesting read."
3,Ah man!!!,Will all the guys stand up.Thank you.Now to your left is guy who doesn't like to be molested by a sexy superior.He saves himself by accidentally recording it over the mobile phone.I just love technology and scandals.
5,One of the most provocative books ever!,When I first began to read Disclosure I didn't know what to expect.But what I got was one of the best books I've ever read.Crichton puts so much depth into his charecters that you feel as if they're your relitives.And I love the idea that it's not always the man doing the sexual harassment.By the end of this book you really begin to hate the charecter of Meredith Johnson.I recomend this book to everybody.
5,Awesome office thriller !,I just cudnt put this book down...it kept me on the edge...n the climax was just so awesome ! The characters are well defined...especially that of Meredith Johnson !The best book of Micheal Crichton !
4,Who has the power?,"Amazing story. Even if it was written 7 years ago, we still have the same question, in the companies who has the power? The answer is not the men nor the women, the power is in the position of the company whether is a man or a woman who is the president, and when that president want something he or she will do whatever he/she has to do to get it, it doesn't matter if is his secretary or her personal adviser, it doesn't matter if nobody want to do this or that thing, if the boss say something they will do it.The story of the book is different because is a man who make charges to a woman of sexual harassment, it is difficult to believe, but it can be real. The book will keep you reading all the time, but has a little mistake, you know exactly what happened in the first chapter and you know who is guilty, may be it will be more interesting if you didn't know exactly what happened until the end of the book."
2,Too Graphic and Very Grim,"I'm a big fan of Michael Crichton and know going into any book of his that intense language and violent deaths are part and parcel of his writing style. However, ""Disclosure"" absolutely disgusted me. With it's detailed description of a death by rape scene, and the whole novel revolving around this scene, I hated this book. I nearly quit reading it when I read this part of the book, but plugged onwards because I thought it would get better. There were really no characters that I cared about in the book, nor did I feel satisfied with how the plot ended."
4,Path breaking Read,"A fresh insight used explosively to generate one of the most entertaining reads ever,"
3,Not the best Crichton book,I love Michael Crichton books so naturally I thought I would like this one. I found it boring and confusing.I gave it three stars because it was good enough to make me finish it.
4,Very Interesting,"The story was very good. I actually had a hard time putting this down. So, it became a quick read. One thing I do have to say is this; being a man if the situation was reversed and Tom was a woman, I wouldn't have gave much thought to it. Hear about sexual harrasment all the time in the media. But reversing the situation made me actual look at the problem and realize what most women will go through in these problematic times."
3,Not very interesting,"Not that bad, although I get tired and confused over the law and firms and all those stuff."
5,"Tasteful, and very well written","I have not yet read the book, but I have seen the movie! It was excellant! I recommend it highly. I thought all of it was done very tasteful. With a lot of movies nowadays, all that you can see are the breasts of women, and this movie was not like that..."
4,great dialogue made this novel.,"After the dialogue, it's hard to say what I like best about this novel. The movie (which I watched last night) seems to follow the storyline to a ""T"". Tom Sanders is E.W.M. (Every White Male), no doubt. However, I got lost in the sheer entertainment value of the book and somewhat disregarded Crichton's didactics, you know about sexual harassment and stuff. As well, I seemed to forget whether a scene occurred just in the novel and not in the movie, and vice versa. I mean, the script was followed that closely to the novel! I sometimes find it a little unnerving that Crighton seems to be writing a screenplay as well as a novel at the same time. I guess I basically read his novels for better explanations for scenes that I saw in his movies and, I think most importantly, for the sheer entertainment value of his novels."
3,A little weak.,"I did enjoy the book and would recommend it, however, I know MC is capable of better plots. I had a bit of trouble buying into the sexual harassment plot. I did enjoy the legal posturing though; I believe it is that part of the novel that saves it from being a waste of ink."
4,DisCLOSEure,"This was the first book which I had read by Crichton, and I must say that it was very interesting. This author showed his ability to relate his main character with the reader. This is a marvelous book about the way business works on the inside, and is a book which I would recommend to all, the only flaw in this book was a weak ending, it almost seemed as if Crichton hadn't though of how he was going to end this book. Although the ending was less than impressive, I still believe that its previous content made up for it."
5,"Gripping, Captivating, Wonderful...","These are all words that I would use to describe this book. It's one of the 2 best books that I've read in quite a long time. As other readers said, starting about page 25, I couldn't put it down. I couldn't wait to read the next page and then the next. I've only finished two books within 48 hours and this was one of them. This work is absolutely wonderful reading. I would highly recommend it."
5,TIMELY,"I was in the middle of reading Disclosure (I don't believe in fate) when my inlaws began to experience legal problems similar to the facts in the book Disclosure. The story is extremely interesting, but it was the page (or 2) the author devotes to the stigma or awkwardness we now always experience in the work place and our home life as well. Most revealing - and in my case - timely. Its an exciting read."
2,Not recommended. :<,"I love Star Trek Voyager. I've read all the Voyager books. I hate to say that this is one of the worst. The author takes liberties with the characters of Seven and Torres that are simply uncalled for, creating bitter conflict between the two for the sake of his story. Sure there might be some friendly rivalry between those two, but this author has them practically at each other's throats. In fact, he's got all the Voyager character's acting very out-of-character, supposedly because they've been psychologically affected by subspace radiation, but even if that explanation were plausible, it makes for a very frustrating and unsatisfying read.I hope that the 2nd book in this ""String Theory"" series will be better since its got a different author."
2,Very Out of Character!,"I loved the storyline and the plot, it was extremely interesting and sounded like something that would've been in a Voyager episode. However, the main characters didn't sound at all like themselves. There were some moments when it sounded true to character but most of the time, the dialogue was absurd and all I could think was, ""Janeway never would've said that!"", or ""No way that sounds like Seven!"", etc.After reading the book I came to write a review and see what some others said. I agree with JensTenebrea's review and they gave great examples of things that were said that didn't sound like the Voyager crew. There are many more throughout the book but that gives you a good idea.I think it's still a good read but if you use to watch Voyager and know the characters, be prepared to be thrown off a little by what's said."
3,Enjoyed Half the Novel,"I found the opening part of this novel extremely slow, up to around page 120. Later, Seven and B'Elanna are sent on a mission together, and I really enjoyed their interactions. On the flip side, the ship-side action is tedious. A subspace field makes everyone stupid and punch-drunk leading to a great potential for humor that is never explored. Basically I enjoyed half the book and slogged through the other half. Too much emphasis and scene time were taken up by the alien Monorans that Voyager is attempting to help/save.Overall an average novel that makes me hope for a better sequel."
4,COMMENTARY,THIS IS A COMMENTARY THAT GOES WITH THE HOLMAN CHRISTIAN STUDY BIBLE. IT HAS A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION IN IT. A VERY GOOD STUDY COMMENTARY
5,Really Excellent,"To be honest, this is the only CD of the ""Archduke"" I have ever heard. To me the Suttgart Piano Trio is fantastic. The work itself however is a masterpiece. Out of the ton of Beethoven CDs I have collected, this one CD has the most special of places reserved for it. Naxos offers the ""Archduke"" and the ""Ghost"" on one CD, or as part of a Volume 1 - 4 set (Vols. 3 & 4). I got it the latter way and I love both CDs. I sent the former to my brother as a gift, and he is happy too. Highest recommendation."
3,How Good?,"This is a reference book for Gold camp and such in California. It gives dates and place approximately. Even so it is not worth the kind of money that I have seen being asked for a used copy. Every time I need this type of info I can look it up on the ""NET"" or drop by a college level library and find the info in three or four minutes. Guess I will have to keep watch at the local libraries to find a copy they are going to send to the shredder. I passed one of this book two years ago. Seems every twenty years these schools weed out the shelves for more room. Now how many folks are checking this book out all the time for info? Yeah that is what they think well the 30 year throw away is coming soon we will see who has one then. Good luck drayps copy the pages close to where you are located.dre"
4,Rabindranath Tagore meets Asian Pop,"Mr. Uttal's ""Monkey"" is most successful in its thoughtful, at times deeply moving lyrics. The mood is reminscent of master poet Rabindrath Tagore, sensitive and inclusive. The music is a delight to hear, complex and often innovative. It is a somewhat too facile to be a masterpiece, but lovers of Indian music will certainly find this a delight to hear."
4,Great fun read,"This is a great summer read, perfect for the beach or by the pool. I think any 20 or 30 something woman can relate to Jancee. The book is a fun and easy read, and I giggled out loud at a few parts. She's a great and witty storyteller with some interesting tales, and I just loved the ending."
4,Lukewarm fun,"Tame but enjoyable insider's look into the cult of celebrity. Nothing to set the world on fire, but enough laugh-out-loud moments to make it worthwile."
4,Rich Mullins,A good book for nice photos but got more info from the book An Arrow Pointing To Heaven.
5,Excellent Devotional/Insprational,Ordinary emotions and ideas related to God and his plan....only as Rich Mullins could phrase it all. It has challenged my thinking and encouraged me.
4,"Great movies, BUT...","Overall, a first-class job... very good productions, full of heart and character, just as all of the Rathbone/Bruce S.H. movies have. Sharp crystal-clear film-transfers, too. But as some other reviewers mention, the ""Hound"" episode does deviate a LOT from the original story (although the film is interesting in its own way). Also, whoever wrote the DVD subtitles for these two movies obviously didn't listen very closely to what was actually being said before he typed in the dialogue; many important words are wrong, and in some cases, the wording that appears makes no sense at all --- it's just meaningless gibberish. But if you have fairly good hearing, and you have loudspeakers that reproduce higher frequencies crisply and cleanly, you should be able to understand most if not all of the actors' words just by listening, and so you probably won't need to turn on the subtitles, anyway. A pleasure to watch. Recommended."
4,awesome start info,good beginning for self education on the subject at hand. Recommended to any one seeking more insight to start a bakery before diving in.
2,What a waste!,"I have BA in business, so this book is just a joke! I don't need someone to tell me what should I need to open a bakery..but how! One page for each subject where it tells you in general things you need..business plan (hello?!), plan, money... You need lots of fund..duh,for realzz? Noo waaay?! To have great employers I need to provide day care, dental,good salary?! Oh,yeaa,noo way? Writer acts if a millionaire decided to open a bakery and opportunities are unlimited in my pocket! I could write that book today..Don't waste your money..honestly. Maybe this book is ok for someone with no idea about business at all."
2,Vague.,"It's a very vague book that I did not find useful. This book would be great if you didn't know what kind of bakery you wanted; but terrible when it comes to the business perspective. Just bits and pieces such as: you'll need a place for you bakery (duh), or: you should consider how your going to file your taxes ( but it doesn't tell you anything else)."
5,Nat Booty,"Yo the energy of the streets is here. I'm feeling this, if you are reading this you need to go pick it up, its the hottest tracks out right now. STRAIGHT UP! Yo there ain't nuthin tighter than that of a NAT's BOOTY. Can you stick your finger in a nat's Booty, that's what I'm talkin about. Drop the steel and come get the real. Ya Heard!"
4,the saga begins,That cd is mad hot!!! The be flippin mad styles between them. Just a crazy mixture of different flows that fit together like a well oiled gear if you know what im sayin. great start to the summer of 2001. .... One more time the cd is all that and a bag of chips!
4,new age of hip hop,"These fellas are definitly the new age of hip hop, when I listened to it, it grabbed me because it is so different and versatile, they hit just about evry coast, with all the artists diferent styles that really come together well. I love ""club anthem"" and ""the lifestyle"" I like how Phrase and kruddy switch there styles for different songs. I cant wait to hear whats next from dirty redd ent."
4,Hip Hop Consciousness,"My first time hearing it. I listened to the beats to see how they would grab me. I was digging it. In a market where beats make the artists, these were definitely some potent material. Not one track sounds like the previous. It had flava for all peoples. The second time I listened to the lyrics. I am very critical on that. The lyrics were on point and coincided with the grooves to spark a relationship between lyricist and musician that only occurs in the essence of creativity. This album defenitely has mass appeal with that old school Hiphop integrity... One..I'm spent.."
5,"This CD is definite proof of ""BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS""","This CD represents years of dedication and hard work. This isn't your regular run of the mill, HIP-HOP CD, it displays the struggles, hardwork, and determination the artists have put forth to make this CD a full success."
4,Great book to curl up on the sofa with.,"I really liked the book. I think the author made sure to have fun, adventure and love in it along with the fear and mystery.I think that it would make a good movie."
1,Disappointing......,"I am glad I only paid $4 including shipping for this book. I too am a huge Victoria Holt fan and after reading the reviews, decided to give Ms. Tyrrel's book a try.But whenever Brand and Stacy came together for one of those mysterious kisses / stares / hugs, I found myself laughing instead of becoming more intrigued with the characters. Why in the world would Brand believe everything Alana was saying about Stacy without asking Stacy herself and vice versa? They both acted like spoiled brats throughout much of the book.I agree with others that Saul was not very well developed; he could have almost been written out of the book.Overall, the plot dragged and when I thought some juicy bit of information was about to be revealed, it was a total letdown because it had nothing to do with why Stacy was being harassed. Very disappointing book."
1,Round peg in an oblong hole,"This adaptor should receive zero (0) stars if one is judging whether or not it will connect the 3725DVS 5"" random orbit sander to a vacuum hose. (I note that it is also advertised as an adapter for the 3 1/4 horsepower plunge router, which may be true, but I didn't order a plunge router.) The accessoriries list for the 3725DVS includes this adapter. If there really is an adapter to allow this sander to be used with a vacuum, please make the change in your advertised accessories list. (Note that it must adapt an oblong race-track shaped outlet on the sander to the round inlet of the hose.) If there is not one, it would be more fair to the customers to inform them that this sander cannot be used with a vacuum hose. I for one would not have purchased the sander had I known that the adaptor would not work."
4,It'll be exiting!,"For something suitable for younger children (despite some bad voice acting with Naruto and Sakura), this product is for you. this DVD will contain some very amazing battle sequences, but nothing like the battles on the Bridge, which will be on the next DVD, most likely. (The Bridge has some of the best battling scenes, like Kakashi activating his solely original move, Lightning Blade, or perhaps Sasuke onlocking something very mysterious hiddin within himself.)This DVD will contain scenes containing Naruto complaining about kiddy missions like saving cats, and urges his sensei kakashi to give them a rank-C mission, bodyguarding Tazuna to a bridge.However, the infamous evil rouge ninja Zabuza ambushes them, starting off with his two followers, the Demon Brothers..."
1,Piece of crap.,This boot was garbage. Did not fit at all on my shifter even though Amazon said it would. -1 stars.
4,Not Bad for a Hard to Find Movie,Because it was in VHS I new it would not be of excellent quality. So its pretty good and is serving its purpose. This movie is very good and has a lot great actors in it. It is a really good movie that was very hard to find. Thanks A Million!!
4,"Not exactly Frankie, but still good","This is a good CD for all you diehard Doo Wop Fans. I can only give this four stars, though, only becuase I don't feel that Lewis' voice quite matches the strength of his older brother the legendary Frankie Lymon, although they're very similar. Too Young, I'm so Happy, and I found out why are three of the best. The Kodaks are nothing to laugh at either with their songs. Check it out."
4,Six Ports not Seven,It is very well built and works very good. Only has two usable firewire ports the third port is the feeder port. It does have 4 usable USB ports. In reality this is a six port hub. The magnetic base makes mounting easy no holes to drill.
2,No Support 24/7,I purchased this items and needed assistance or really just to get a question answer. They have a toll free number which I thought was great however I made three calls thru the week and left my number 3 times and was never contacted.
5,Wired Hex set by BD,They do what they are designed to do....keep me from falling to my death on the side of a cliff in the middle of nowheresville.
5,Easy Solution,This is a great product of any type of skin issue in animals. I add it to my regular shampoo for both horses and dogs and it covers myriad dermatological issues
4,a reality check for animal lovers,"I bought this book after reading the author's article in the New York Times using the techniques she learned in the school on her husband. It was so funny I had to buy the book. I didn't give it five stars simply because it is very long and some of the subject matter gets difficult to read, but I would recommend this book to anyone who knows that owning and training animals on a professional level is more about hard bitten reality than love centered euphoria. As someone who has owned and trained horses for many years I saw similaries and learned a few things, too. Good read."
4,"IF I RAN THE ZOO, HERE IS WHAT I WOULD DO...","This is an engaging look at an extraordinary program for people interested in working professionally with wild animals. If I were a lot younger, I would enroll in this school in a heartbeat. The descriptions of the programs and the daily life of the students and their animal charges, many times funny, sometimes tragic, is excellent reading - lively, entertaining and informative, and well written into the bargain. My only quibble is one mentioned in another review - so many animals are mentioned by their ""given"" names after being introduced to us only once, that I couldn't keep track of which animal was later being referenced. Was ""Sam"" the wombat or the tiger? I had to constantly look back to find out who was biting whom. Apart from that, this is a really interesting and entertaining book."
5,What a delightful book about a unique program!,"I grew up one town over from EATM, apparently around the time it got going. As an animal behavior nut I remember (decades ago!) seriously considering applying for the program, but at the time zoos weren't the kind of places they are now (more focused on conservation and education than entertainment) and I went another way.Fast forward to me having time to revisit the passions of my youth, considering a career change. The EATM program is now world-class and one of perhaps three programs world-wide for exotic animal training. I didn't realize how unique it was, because it was in my backyard and when you're a kid nothing that close is special. This book follows the first year class of 2004 through trials and tribulations, and though I realized that this is still not the direction for me, but living the program vicariously page by page was wonderful."
2,Warning: This book is not about animals!,"After putting the book aside half way through to pursue more rewarding activities, I realized I hadn't read the title carefully.The title really says exactly what the book is about and the author's attitude about it. Her view on animals: they kick, bite and scratch. And poop, lots and lots of poop discussion. She doesn't really like animals and presents an unsympathetic view.The second half of the title says the book is about life, meaning the students, not the animals. Most of the book is about how unpleasant the experience is, how unbalanced the students lives are and their broken relationships.You won't learn anything about animals here. It has the unamusing feel of a required book report."
1,Don't be deceived by the pictures,"The picture shows good looking big slices of the ginseng in the box, which makes you think that they are all sliced from the bigger ginseng. But after I opened the box, I found out that except the surface ones, underneath, they are all smashed pieces, scraps and slices from very small ginseng.It is deceivable and cheating by putting a few big slices on top and stuffing scraps underneath, and it really made me to think if quality of the product is up to its descriptions!"
5,Motorola SB6121,"Although his box is not as large as I thought to be, as a gift to my parents, they love it."
3,Wisconsin Ginseng slices,"Part of the slices are very small and like crumb. Otherwise, it is OK. In the future, I prefer to purchase bigger package such as 1 lb pack."
4,Hsu'e Ginseng 126.4,"Shiping is fast, the package look right, products in good shape and color--which may indicate good quality, have not tried it though."
4,"If you don't love it at first, hang in there","When the Miles Davis Quintet got together to record four albums worth of material, they naturally recorded a lot of standards. Steamin' has four standards, a song by Dizzy and a song by Monk. My initial reaction was that the quality of the material depending on the quality of the song they chose. After continuing to listen to it, though, the playing by the group shone through clearly. So, is this album as good as, say, Milestones? No. Is this better than most jazz albums? Definitely yes."
3,dig this,You just about can't go wrong with Miles Davis. I especially liked his version of Salt Peanuts.
5,"""Steamin"" would be an accurate titled indeed!","It's amazing, the sound quality of these old recordings. The recordings, indeed, maybe old, but the musicianship is something that's undeniable! The entire band is amazing - just creating magic out of this air. It is so rare that the artists around today achieve this level of maturity, virtuosity, etc. It's truly divine - something not of this Earth, seemingly...No go get yourself stuck on Miles!"
5,Excellent and accessible,"This is one of four albums compiled from two days of recording in 1955, and all four contain highly satisfying, entertaining jazz music. Davis's developing trumpet sound is distinctive and beautiful, and these are the recordings that put John Coltrane on the map (he didn't release anything under his own name until a few years later). Steamin' is mostly mellow music, although ""Salt Peanuts"" is a kick in the face, with a fast tempo and a long drum solo. This is highly recommended for anyone with more than a passing interest in Miles Davis."
4,Soothing music for the soul,"I first heard Dama and D'Gary on independant radio, with their track ""Be Cool."" After that night, I made it my mission to discover the writers of that amazing song. After much research, I came across ""The Long Way Home.""This CD is everythin I expected it to be. Soft, melodic tunes, coupled with rich vocals, nicely arranged. Some songs were a little too chirpy for me, but without a doubt, this CD was a worthy buy. You won't hear anything like this."
3,"This is just ""clip-art"", no words or photos","Not what I expected. Just as the title says, this is 670 illustrations. There is no text, no photos. Just illustrations."
1,Arrived Damaged In Multiple Places,"This lamp arrived damaged all over the place - the legs wouldn't screw on properly, there were scratches etc. I wanted to return it for a refund. However, Home Decorators does not make anything easy, as they don't want to pay for return shipping. Returns are a nightmare - I would avoid them if at all possible. I finally ended up keeping the lamp and they refunded my money. I would not recommend this lamp."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"The above Title of this book clearly states ""(3 Volume Set)"" and yet I only received the 3rd volume. The ISBN that they have listed is for the 3 volume set and not just one volume. I called Amazon (actually they called me, it was nifty) and complained. They saw that it was a mistake, seemingly a common one judging by what some people have already said here. And now they are sending me all 3 volumes. My real complaint is that now I have to wait an entire month before receiving it and I needed volume 1 for school!!! Can't beat the price, so I will have to borrow a book until mine arrives. If this happens to you just call Amazon and force them to send you all 3 books because the ISBN is for a 3 volume set and not just one volume!! DONT LET THEM FOOL YOU!!"
2,ruin a great film 101,"How to ruin a great film:lesson 1: pick a great film i.e.belle de jourlesson 2: don't put any effort into the dvd release whatsoeverfor any questions, see the belle de jour dvd"
2,"Don't buy this. It has inaccurate English subtitles, though the English voiceover is correct.",The commentary is also a disappointment.Look elsewhere for better quality subtitles. There is a Bunuel boxed collection available on Amazon UK which may be better.
4,Caution - the subtitles are screwed up,"The reason I'm giving it only 4 stars is that this (excellent) film was not properly transferred - whoever prepared the English subtitles messed them up by incorrectly italicizing some of them thus designating certain sequences as ""dreams"" (see Amy's review below, for example). Apparently, someone at the video transfer house actually sat down and spent considerable amount of time deciding (incorrectly most of the time) what is real and what is not real in the film, and italicizing the titles accordingly. This becomes especially nonsensical when one considers that Bunuel has stated many times that he didn't always know himself how to separate the scenes. To him the ending, for example, is real. But some know-it-all slapped italics on the dialogue there because he knew better that the director. Let's hope the DVD version will fix this and present the entire dialogue straight - just like in the original (what a novel concept!)"
1,Artsy-fartsy loser....,"Ok erotica fans...I saw this loser in the theatre in 1995. It was a complete waste of time and money...if you are looking for a good looking woman getting deiciplined and sexually provoked, save your money! This film is no more ""erotic"" than one of Madonna's video's from the early 1990s! You could watch this film on broadcast television, by today's standards. Until I discover something made better than ""The Image"" or ""The Story of O"", I'd save your money and don't waste any time on this slow moving, farce of a picture.If you enjoy an ""artsy-fartsy"" film with no nudity or S/M scenes...then this IS your film. Its certainly not worth my time."
1,Boring de jour....,"Horrible example of passe erotica...PG-13 by today's standards. Not in the same league as The Story of O, Emmanuel, or The Image.This films fails at every level to excite the viewer. I saw this in the theatre a few years ago and it put my wife to sleep. If another woman doesn't get excited by what's transpiring in an erotic film...why would it be worth anything?I can't find one reason to recommend this boring, less than erotic story about a housewife turned hooker. A hooker that never has sex on camera or anyplace else!Save your money."
1,Worthless,"""Belle de Jour"" is widely acclaimed as a masterpiece. I would like to know: by whom? Certainly by nobody with high self-esteem. If art's highest purpose is to project life as it ought to be, then, according to this film's creators, life ought to be seen as dispensable, drab, meaningless, and amoral. What is virtue? ""Belle de Jour"" doesn't know and doesn't care. What is coherent plot and characterization? ""Belle de Jour"" puts on a blindfold and pins a tale on neither. What sort of role best suits a stunningly beautiful actress? ""Belle de Jour"" says let's stick Catherine Deneuve in a pillory of an ugly, thankless role and spit at her as a self-loathing, self-deluded prostitute. What is ""Belle de Jour""? Worthless."
2,Prostitution in the Afternoon,"A rather dated and arguably misogynous film about a beautiful upper middle class housewife who has everything but prostitution in the afternoon. Those who ""understand"" the picture may marvel at how it ridicules the hypocrisy of society (how shocking!) and other brilliant ideas, but most people probably enjoy this film because of Catherine Deneuve, who went on to bigger and better things playing a call girl opposite Burt Reynolds."
2,Of academic interest only.,"This film is typical of movies made is the 60's, the pace is slow and the characters two dimensional. The subject it covered broke some ground at the time but it's pretty tame by today's standards."
2,Poor!,A beautiful woman in a lousy movie. Poor plot & ok acting.Worthit just ti look @ Denueve She was a beauty!!
2,"Dated, boring and noninspiring","Although this movie is an all-time favorite, I'd attribute it to the beauty of Catherine Deneuve alone. The whole plot is unreal or at least it's not done very convincingly. If the movie is still being watched for promised and advertised erotism, I wonder if it satisfies the viewers. The sex scenes are pathetic and definitely dated, not that it's because of the lack of crude scenes but actors look very awkward and lost, and the whole impression is of an embarrassment. Perhaps such scenes titilated the audiences 30 years ago. It's disappointing in many ways and it is quite boring indeed. There are better films by Bunuel and I fail to understand why this one is called masterpiece. See for yourself, though..."
1,Daydeaming and Fantasies can have Consequences,I found this movie to be a fascinating story about the trauma that can be caused to those we love when we allow our fantasies and daydreaming to interfere with our actual lives. I was constantly wondering where I would draw the line if I was the heroine. The experience allowed me to visualize the mayhem that could be caused by to much fantasy/daydreaming.
2,Bete de Jour,"Two stars reflecting grudging appreciation that the film is available on DVD. Nothing for Disney/Buena Vista regarding this travesty of a package. Call in the Criterion Collection for urgent life-support... please! A non-anamorphic transfer of this gorgeous film, absolute rubbish printed on the package, pitiful supplements, and as usual, top dollar. With this and 'Purple Noon', Disney have lobbed a double whammy spit ball at serious film/DVD fans. I'm not having a bad dream!!"
1,A rather neglected history of the movie,"At the time Belle de Jour came out censorship was rampant everywhere, even in France. So the movie had to undergo a range of cuts depending on the countries where it was to be shown (usually in adult theaters). For the VHS version it seems the producers cut out all of the scenes that had once been censored and added some cuts of their own to make it acceptable everywhere, even on TV.Of course in this way the viewer misses much of the sense of the movie. For instance, does anybody who saw the VHS (or the DVD) version know why Severine smiles after her meeting with the china man with his musical box?Further it's true that the DVD looks like it originated from a much abused VHS copy with nothing apparently done to improve its quality. But to restore the movie close to the director's first intent you'd have to dig out what's left of the original materials (after so many years there might be a lot missing) and do a full re-editing job. Would it be worth it?"
3,"Cute Idea, and it works too but the fur gets everywhere!","This brush works great, I mean, It gets ALL of the shedding fur off my kitty....BUT....the fur doesn't stick to the brush so the fur gets all over the furniture anyway (and on my clothes, in the air, etc.)I thought I'd save money buying this instead of the one getting rave reviews costing $25-$30, but I guess you get what YOU PAY FOR! I also will not be returning it because it costs as much as the shipping so I'd end up even financially."
4,Gets the hair OFF the cat!,"My wife and I love our 2 shorthair cats (1 siamese, 1 tonkinese), but hate the hair that gets everywhere. I was a bit skeptical when trying this, as I've tried virtually every type of brush out there, including several similar rubber brushes. I don't know if it is the specific type of rubber used or the shape of the ""bristles"", but this thing is crazy effective. I just could NOT BELIEVE how much hair it takes out, and the cats enjoy being brushed with it. I do agree with some reviewers that the hair doesn't all stay on the brush- some will end up on your clothes and flying around in the air while you're brushing. However, if you brush the cat in the garage or somewhere else where the flying fur won't matter, you're all set. Fantastic!"
4,They love it! I like it.,Both my cats loved it immediately! And it did a fine job of scattering cat hair all over the place...which did sort of defeat the purpose. I'll be careful where I use this. Keep a lint roller handy!
5,I am so Happy!!!,"I bought this on Saturday. I had it on Monday. My cat was brushed like never before on Monday night. Our cat Gizmo hates to be brushed. (Hate is a mild term.) He actually tolerated this product! Gizmo is a medium coat tabby cat, his coat is very thick and he has been shedding like crazy for years. This product was able to groom away at least 5 large handfulls of shedding hair. (he is also a very large cat) He didn't scratch, growl, hiss, nothing. He took it like a good kitty. This is a great product!On Tuesday I used it on my male beagle. He has an extremely heavy coat for a beagle and he LOVES this product!! he wouldn't let me stop brushing him! He too had a lot of handfuls of shedding hair that came right off. I recommend this product to anyone!!!"
5,An important book about Montessori education,"I believe your book is an indispensable resource for Montessori teachers and for any non-Montessori teachers and/or administrators who want to know how and why Montessori works so well with children. For Montessori teachers, it provides the validation of principles that are sometimes abandoned in Montessori classrooms to appease parents, administrators, or the teacher's own insecurities. For non-Montessori educators, it offers a rationale for what we do in terms that they can understand and a wealth of non-Montessori research to back up our classroom practice. It's quite a convincing book for both audiences!-Michael Duffy, co-author of ""Children ol the Universe: Cosmic Education in the Montessori Classroom"" (Parent Child Press)"
5,"A favorite book of mine for many, many years.","I recently ordered this book (and Treasures of the Snow) as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old granddaughter. The author, Patricia M. St. John has been a favorite in our family. I was first introduced to these books by my mother when I was 10 years old - my children loved them - now my grandchildren do also. Before the author died, I wrote to her expressing my appreciation for the impact her books had had on my life. I was honored to receive a gracious, kind reply . The message contained in The Tanglewoods' Secret (and others) is timeless. I could not recommend them more highly."
4,Wholesome book,"I bought this book because we read ""Treasures of the Snow"" by the same author (Patricia St.John)which was loved by every member of our family. This book was good too, but took a few chapters to capture, my children's full interest, where they didn't want to stop reading. It wonderfully weaves the love of our Savior, the Good Shepherd,into the story without being preachy. Some parts of the book talk about types of flowers. This is like Greek to my children and if you don't have an interest flowers, minds tend to wander. The story is about two children(a brother and sister) living with their aunt. It mostly focuses on the girl and her overcoming her selfishness and bad temper by meeting the Good Shepherd. Overall it is worth reading and I will continue to seek out this author's books."
1,This NOT the Rod Steiger version,"I just received this version, and it is not the Rod Steiger version. This is a 45 min. documentary."
2,merely mean spirited,"Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant are mean to the ""round headed buffoon"" Karl Pilkington, an ""everyman.""The meanness however has no mercy, no glimmer of insight or self awareness.If Pilkington was allowed to do some reversals and get back his two tormentors once in a while, it would have been funny. However, he is truly one dimensional, either in real life or as a character, no meanness, no vengefulness to look forward to.Ricky you really have to see visually - he really is a short fat man who is physically captivating to watch. This animated podcast format does not do justice.I rarely stop watching a series, but this series, I really faded out towards the last two episodes, and I cannot swear that I watched it to the end. I honestly do not remember - that is how repetitive and droning the mean Pilkington jokes got."
2,Disappointing!,"If you are a Gervais fan because you appreciate his clever style of comedy, blending situational absurdity with witty sarcastic comebacks and balanced well with his simpleton, uncouth friends (as in Extras), then you'll be bored with this series. They just make fun of his bald, doofus sidekick in a manner that gets really tiresome - and really fast!"
5,A great saw,"Having owned this saw for 10 years and working in construction, loghome building, and timberframing I have found this saw to be very reliable. It has the torque to power thru any wood or log necessary for the job at hand. The saw is versatile and can be used with different accessories made for it. I would definitely recommend this saw to anyone for any type of construction."
5,Great Saw,I just bought the 8 1/4 inch saw today. I immediately went to the shop and started cutting. We are making Curly Maple Pencil Post beds for an upcomingshow. Using 3 inch / 12/4 curly hard maple for the post and needed to cut them out of a plank. I think this thing thought it was cutting butter as it made the cuts without effort. I love my wife but I think she has competition now. Do not tell her that or I am in big trouble. I so far see no problems with it. By the way No it does not cut 4 inch material unless it gets flipped over.
1,A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY,You have to struggle and pull this on over your hips and butt to get it over your tummy. Cheap material that doesnt even hold you in! I wore it once and put it in the trash after.
3,As Seen on TV - The Invisible Tummy Trimmer,"No it is does not tied as on TV or picture, just a little bit..."
5,Place In This World,"It is an awesome book that I knew would be a great read....written by a great songwriter and story teller, Michael W Smith"
5,Al Green had it.,Good quality product. Tons of tunes. Top notch vocals are Al Green's trademark. Plenty of soul. The only drawback is that the producer recorded lame horn arrangements.
1,Horrible customer service,"I ordered this koozie for a Christmas gift. When it arrived, it was a completely different koozie than is pictured above. It is a red collapsable koozie. Clearly, that is not what is pictured above. I sent multiple emails to the contact I was provided and have yet to receive any response. I am strongly disappointed in the customer service of this shop. I would not recommend ordering anything from this store."
4,Great DVD storage,"I've had this DVD shelf for 1 1/2 years. It's been great and is holding up well. Only complaint is that after tons of spinning it (once in a blue moon) seems to get at ""the end"" and you have to spin the other direction--again, very rare. Other than that I would have given it 5 stars."
1,Fell apart in less then 4 hours,"Returned for refund. The first time worn it didn't last 4 hours before one of the stones fell off, then the clasp ring fell off. This is a real piece of junk!"
1,"Long John Thermal Dog Pajamas, Large Pink","My Items never came and the seller only refound the price of the items descounting the sending price, BUT HE DIDNT SEND IT"
3,Good for introduction for fundraising,I used this book to introduce fundraising in my classroom. It was ok but not exactly what I was looking for
2,A little too much for one book,"I liked the idea of this book when I read the description, but it's really A LOT to be in one little children's book! It's hard to follow and keep up, and there's just too much involved. I bought it for a lesson on money, most of the children were disinterested pretty quickly. A little disappointed."
5,Excellent tool!,"Well made, quality tool with ample power for most tasks. Well balanced too. Only drawbacks are lack of wrench storage, cheap original blade, and no case (but this saw gets used enough it would spend little time in case anyway). Deduct 1 star for these faults if you see fit."
5,Still going strong after 22 yesrs.,"I bought this saw 22 years ago and have used it since. I am a professional electrician and use a circular saw from time to time on the job for wood braces and supports. The saw has never been serviced or repaired. Some 7 years ago, I bought a Freud carbide blade from Home Depot. That's all I've done to it, and it keeps on going and going. When it no longer works, I'll get another. But, at the rate that it last and last, who knows when that will be."
5,skillsaw review,Great saw by skill. I have used the 5510 saw for over 20 years now . Probably one of the best saws i have ever owned . I'm a professional carpenter and have used many saws over the years but this one is my favorite. I have let other carpenters use it while on the job and they were impressed . Some have even gone out bought one for themselves after using mind. I still use the first one i bought 20 years ago .
2,"Great saw, wore it out.","This is a great little saw. Powerful, light, fast and accurate. But if you're not careful you can spin the blade on the shaft. I did on a job rough cutting some 1"" hardwood planks. Didn't really notice till the end of the day that the saw blade was running out of round. When I took the blade off I found the blade had cut a grove on the shaft. This should never have happened, the shaft should've been hardened.I will probably buy another and be more careful."
2,Saw has design flaw.,"While the saw works great as I used it to cut through some interior doors I was replacing but it has a big design flaw! There is a guide plate that has about an inch on one side of the blade and over three inches on the other. If you were making a cross cut and wanted to slide this guide against a straight edge you would want to use the 3+ inch side to have more support for the saw, right? The makers of this saw built the motor so low to the guide plate that it cannot slide against anything more than an 1/8 tall. This is really stupid. The saw works with the guild plate if you are cutting something thin like plywood, because you can raise the saw up (making the cut less deep) to clear your straight edge. The solution: for cutting something thick like interior doors, where you might want to use a straight edge - you have to use the one inch side. Not great support for the saw - but it works."
5,My wormdrive is collecting dust,"I really like this saw. I was able to find blades at Home Depot. The power is more than adequate, far more powerful and comfortable than a battery saw. That said, I wouldn't use this tool to cut 2 X 12s all day. I think that would stress it. But I've been using it on 1X, plywood (where it really excels, and 2x. It has no trouble plowing through a 2 X 4. I just used it yesterday to cut slots for 2 x 4s into a 4X post that was in the ground. I used to do this with my 18 pound skilsaw. With this little guy, its a breeze.I've seen people complain that it won't cut a 2X at 45 degrees. Most of my 2X cuts are 90 degrees and if I need to cut 45 degrees, I'll dust off my worm drive.Bottom line: I am very pleased with this saw."
5,great little saw,"I do remodels. bought this saw a yr ago after using another old 5 1/2 for many yrs. This is the easiest cutting saw I have ever used. Handle position is great for straight cuts. cross cuts on 2Xs are a breeze. no problem using a rip guide for long, straight, accurate cuts.Only drawback is blade selection, as mentioned before. Only have 1 tooth choice locally of carbide blades.After several cross jobs with different crews, everyone who picks it up & makes just 1 cut, loves the saw.This is one tool I recommend without qualification."
3,"Great saw, good luck finding blades for it.",Great saw. Light weight. Left side cut is great for right handers. Cuts 2-by with ease. The Light weight makes it the choice for cutting off rafter tails. But...good luck finding a replacement blade for it. Amazon does not sell them. Neither does Loews or Home depot. Black and Decker did make a blade for it but I have not seen them for some time. Buy the saw but find a source and stock up on blades for it.
2,delicate,"At first I was very happy with this purchase, but the depth adjustment bar got bent and tweaked everything else out of alignment. It is ok for occasional use, but if you intend to use it a lot I would go with the 7-1/4"" porter cable."
2,"Worked great, for a month.............","We bought this to replace a cheapo ryobi circ saw.Worked great for a month. we cross cut a lot of hardwood moldings.just over a month later, its sitting on my desk smelling pretty burnt up.we'll see what skill has to say"
1,[price] item,"Well, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this saw. For what they cost, I figured it would be good quality. It's cheaply made stamped guides and adjusting mechanisms were out of adjustment and the saw would not square up. It won't cut straight following the guide, you must watch the blade only.The first thing I did was get a decent carbide blade and that didn't help.The 6.5 amp motor struggles on 2X4 cross cuts.1/2""-3/4"" plywood better be all you try it on. I use it daily in my business,and I recommend something with more power and better quality. For [price] skil should be ashamed"
2,Hard to hear,"I bought the phone based on the good user reviews but was disappointed with the volume of the phone. Some people I called were quiet compared to my other phones, and others were nearly impossible to hear even with the volume turned all the way up. In fact, I found that turning up the volume mostly just increased the volume of the static.Another problem with the phone is its ergonomics. For me anyway, I had a hard time finding a comfortable ear position, and it was not designed to be held between ear and shoulder. It really requires one hand on the phone at all times."
1,Say what??,"This phone stinks. And for one reason only: Even when turned on Max Volume it is difficult to hear the person you are speaking to.And no, I do not have any hearing problems."
1,Terrible Sound Volume,This phone makes you think you need your hearing checked. Turning the volume to maximum only increases the static. I sent mine back. What were they thinking??
5,Great Phone,"I bought this phone last week, and at first I didn't think I would like it, although it was very clear. I took it back and purchased a Panasonic model with caller id/call waiting. I had previously bought a Panasonic 900 mhz phone that was really clear. This Panasonic had a lot of static, which was very irritating. So, after two days, I returned the Panasonic and re-purchased the Uniden. I've been very pleased with it. It is very clear and easy to use."
1,static and more static,Call goes thru and then the static assault begins. I almost threw this phone at the wall. Junk.
2,Decent features but poor sound quality,"It's a decent phone, but just barely. The base doesn't take up much space, and the phone supports both regular Caller ID and Call Waiting Caller ID. The memory function would be better if you could see the list while you're already on a call (to enter your voicemail or long distance code, etc.), but it serves its purpose. In other words, as a basic cordless phone, its feature set is just what it should be.My biggest complaint is with the sound quality. The sound generally is muffled, difficult to hear, and quite low-volume. Because of that, I wouldn't really recommend it to anybody."
5,Astounding Cinema!,"I love Mr. Harris's exciting camerawork and editing! Beautiful and kinetic and kinesthetic energy! all of the movies on this disc are excellent and entertaining but I think ""Organism"" steals the show. For me it's stronger and more thrilling than even ""Koyaanisqatsi"". Some of the shots are unbelievably dynamic, huge, and mind-blowing. Highly recommended!"
3,Trashy and fun like a bad B-movie is fun.,"Have you ever watched a bad movie just for the fun of it? You know, a movie like ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" or any old 70's horror movie, for that matter?Well, reading this book is kind of like watching a movie so bad, it's good.Oddly, the writer is actually technically rather skilled, so the book itself is an easy, unjarring read. It's the wacky, zany, zaftig plotline that causes the raspberries.I don't know for sure what I think about Amityville -- it scared the dickens out of me as a kid, but as an adult I have to wonder if it was just a lucrative hoax. Yet, reputable researchers like Ed and Lorraine Warren claim it was real. Maybe the whole Amityville phenomenon was true to begin with, then became exaggerated as time went on.But never mind about the truth or falsity of the phenomenon. This book is worth picking up used. It will give some chills, some laughs, and a big dose of nostalgia for the 70's and early 80's."
3,The Passionate Brood,"As a big historical fiction fan, I am amazed that I have not read this author before. The back of the book showcased several of her novels, all of which sound good. I will have to read more by this author at some point. In this book,Richard the Lionheart is the historical figure of focus. Thrown into the mix is if Robin Hood was Richard's foster brother. This book holds true to the genre with jousting, warring, and using women as pawns to power. The writing style is similar to that of Philippa Gregory, whose writing I love. This book is well-written and the author obviously has done her research. I always cringe at the plight of women in this time, as they really had no say over who they would marry or where their lives would take them. I recommend this book to fans of historical fiction.I received this book from SourceBooks to review.[...]"
1,You're in the 21st century,"I was going to buy ""Passionate Brood"" but the author's foreword left me cold. ""I'm going to write in present-day English, and I make no apology"". Well, that just shows she doesn't want to put forth a little extra effort. People in the 14th century may have had the same human feelings, but their attitudes and their speech were shaped by their time, their religion, and their rigid social class. Dialog helps get that across. Go ahead and read ""Passionate Brood"", but then read ANYthing written by Sharon Kay Penman......you will see the difference immediately."
5,Should be 20 stars,"I have a lot, if not most of tibetan bell/bowls CDs. This artist is absolutely the most talented. I play Tibetan bowls myself and cannot even come close to duplicating what Tillman can do. I have bought every CD of his I can locate. His work definetly puts the listner in a deep altered state. I know there are several other ones that are available, that Amazon does not carry. I found on the website. If your into meditation or sleep or stress relief..this may be a great find."
2,"If you KNOW you want a 'plastic' airplane, move on...","Good book, unless you know what you want. If you are looking at building, and are looking for options, then check this one out. It covers several different composite kitplanes (and one-offs) and a generalization of how they are assembled. If you are designing or already building, move on. Sorry, but its just too general..."
2,Not too good.,"I guess the book gives a decent overview of composite construction in homebuilt aircraft. But I concur with the other reviewer that it is poorly edited (written), a little incoherent, and (this bothers me the most) contains illustrations with no text directing the reader to them. I guess you're supposed to figure out for yourself which drawing goes with the text you're currently reading. Frustrating, i tell ya."
4,A good book for the graduate level,This book is a good book but does not talk about the design of planes very much but talks more about putting the planes together and how it is done.
3,Funny,"Just have to say that if you want to watch something where you can laugh, this is the movie! Go ahead!*Sponsored Post"
1,I don't think I can take anymore,"This is my first and as far as I can tell only experience with this author. She seems to have come up with a facinating plot and then proceeds to mess it up almost beyond belief.Her main character never seems to dominate the novel. She constantly tells us how smart and formidable her heros are and then they prove her wrong by not being able to find or figure out anything. She has no sense of drama or suspense. She constantly changes the people driving the book, we go from Monk, to his wife, to Rathbone and if it doesn't fall in their lap they would never get there. One thought illustrates this point to a tee, she tells us Rathbone is the greatest barrister in the relm, then at the start of the trial she tells us Tobias defeats him as often as not, from the way it goes from there that is an understatement. Sometimes I give things a second chance but not this time thanks."
4,"Wonderful, as usual!",This book was gripping until the end - though without the usual tension between Hester and Monk to add that extra bite we've been used to in this series of books.
4,A True Victorian WhoDunIt,"I have read every book that Anne Perry has written and I enjoy every one, but I particularly like The William Monk series. I find this series is darker than the Pitt ones and every book has fine examples of Victorian British courtroom drama. I marvel at the way that Ms. Perry can portray the Victorian mindset - the prejudices and the close-mindedness. Improbable as it seems to us in our modern day world, being quick to censure and to judge others against some impossible ideal was very prevalent in late 1800 England. There are a lot of plot twists and turns in this book, and it has its usual surprise ending. In some ways the ending seems less probable than other books in the series, but it doesn't impair the fun of the read."
3,"Anne Perry does it again, and again and again...","Although I will continue to read any and all of Anne Perry's Victorian novels that come my way, I am ALWAYS ready to scream at her habit of having her characters echo themselves and each other constantly. She reiterates actions, thoughts and opinions to the point of making me cry out, ""I get it, I get it."" And do we really have to have numerous characters speak of another as ""poor little thing"" or some such stereotypical phrasing? Really...it's like the same person with different names saying THE SAME THING in the SAME tone about the SAME incidents. She also goes into much too much rehashing of plot."
4,Perry does it again!,"It is amazing that Anne Perry can keep coming up with such marvelous and convoluted plots! Her newest, Twisted Root, again saves its major surprises for the end, just when you think there's no way to work out a satisfactory answer. Again, it also give insightful info about the Victorian era and it was nice to finally see Hester and Monk married, although this part of the story took a back seat to the plot. All in all, it's a very enjoyable read!"
4,William Monk,"the character of William Monk is well developed and intriquing. The detailed description is , as usual in most of Anne Perry's books, transport the reader to the time and place of the story."
3,Still Worth Reading,"I suppose it's difficult for an author to know how much background to reiterate when some readers may be first-timers while others have absorbed all the earlier books in the series. Still, I wish Perry would realize that it's also difficult for loyal fans to plow through yet another rehashing of nurses' plight in the Crimea and 19th-century England. I find myself skimming an author whose every word I used to savor. Also detracting from this book was the way characters - even whole courtrooms - kept jumping to ridiculous conclusions with scant provocation. Despite these complaints, I still enjoy the characters and the world that Perry has so carefully created. She's a skilled enough writer that it's fun watching how she gets from A to Z even when it's pretty obvious what Z's going to be."
2,Pretty Good,This was certainly not one of the best books that I have read but I enjoyed it because I read it with my classmates. I think you need to have a great imagination to enjoy this book. I think it is more exciting to children. Adults would probably not like it at all.
4,Anthropology or Social History?,"From 1947 to 1951, Maya Deren filmed a large number of Voudoun rituals in Haiti. In 2007, her heirs compiled and edited this film into the DVD we have today. Then narration was added from Deren's book of the same name. It's an utterly fascinating anthropologist's look at something which has been incorporated into many modern cultural phenomena, including jazz and subsequent music and dancing styles. Here, however, they have important religious significance.Basically the Loa (gods) take possession of the priests and priestesses, and are referred to as ""mounting"" the person, as a rider mounts a horse. This is, by the way, the reason my late husband declared that my totem animal is the horse. He mounted me as a god.I challenge anyone to see this film and not tap their feet or sway to the music."
3,Love LOVE the scent but doesnt last,"ALthough the scent of this deoderant is awesome, it does not work for me.It smells every bit like the mandarin orange sweetness with the potent but dark scent of patchouli, and I wish it lasted longer, but after about 15 minutes, it stops smelling so great and leaves the regular armpit smell...so I have to re-apply very often."
2,Key word patchouli,"If you like the smell of patchouli, you will like this deodorant. I personally don't and so can't recommend it."
3,great smell-scent,"this smell is so fresh and clean smelling, i really enjoy it. It works on BO for about 4-8 hours depending on the intensity of your day, reapplying is necessary but that is normal (i find) with a natural deodorant, unless it contains tree tea oil. If you shower at night and apply then by the time you wake up the next morning you might need a shower again, depending on how sweaty of a sleeper you are. I am happy with the results if I am just having a day around the house, but if your going out then go with a tree tea oil based one. Sometimes I combine the 2 types to get the nice smell of this one to cover up the tree tea oil smell...in my opinion much better then tom's of maine (smells good but is always sticky) but Jason brand or another with tree tea oil is much better, if you know those brands. Good luck."
3,not for me,"i love the scent, i love how it is natural. i wish it was better at deodorizing, however. it just didn't work for me."
2,Disappointing,"This product is cheaply made and has only a very mild smell that does not last. I am also not sure why the picture shows two of the product, because you only get one."
2,This really does not work.,I find that this really works no better than using nothing. I will go back to using magnesium oil spray for deodorant. It works great and I get my magnesium.
2,"smells ok on it's own, but does nothing whatsoever for my BO","i am not a particularly stinky or sweaty person, but i was looking for a less chemically deodorant when i became pregnant. i tried to like this, i really did, but my BO was hideous when i wore this - worse than when i just went without altogether. it is also pretty slimy. i gave up and went back to dove."
2,"Good concept, not effective","I really like the Nature's Gate soap, shampoo, and conditioner products and was hoping the deodorant would be equally good. However, it was not able to handle the task as effectively as other stick deodorants on the market. It smells great, but the consistency is almost like soap and difficult to apply. The baking soda is not able to keep sweaty areas dry or absorb body odor enough."
1,"Very, extremely disappointed","I feel I got tricked into buying this. DON'T BUY THIS!!! By the way, the deorderant DOES NOT smell like fruit. I don't recommend this item unless you want your armpits to sweat and smell. I'm not happy with this product>:["
4,great stuff for your hair,"this gel is amazing, from its smell to the look it creates. Even though this is the light hold, you get enough hold to get you through the day and with a natural look. Try some, worth the price."
3,Padded Cycling Shorts,"The shorts are good for the price. As stated in other reviews, the padding is thin and more for experience riders. I wish the spandex was of a better quality, but they do the job."
1,Girl Biker,"I went to the manufacturer's site for these shorts and thought they sounded like they would be great. Upon receiving them and wearing them, the fabric is thin, the padding is thin, and they're the only bike shorts I own that I can't wear to spin class due to the thin padding. I mountain and rode bike and was extremely disappointed in the quality of these shorts. Needless to say, I won't be purchasing another pair of shorts from this company."
3,Good Bike Shorts,"I purchased these shorts because they are somewhat cheaper than others. They definitely make my rides more comfortable. They can be a bit uncomfortable though because the hem of the legs, where they sit on the thigh, has a slightly tacky plastic ribbon that sticks to your leg. I don't know if this is standard in bike shorts. This is my first pair. Clearly these are meant to keep the shorts in place, and they work, but after a few hours of riding, I notice that it's itchy and painful where that plastic ribbon is.I recommend these shorts for shorter bike rides, but they are not as comfortable for longer ones."
5,"Handy recorder, excellent quality",Excellent voice quality on this digital recorder. Saving files onto your PC is a snap with the serial or USB cables. Use the software that comes with it to edit the recordings and then save them to WAV files that can be played on any system. The data compression is excellent -- the sound files are small and can be emailed or put onto floppy disk.
5,It does not get any better than this!!,"As a native of Brooklyn New York, the Harlem Doo Wop, slave cadence music immediatly jumps right out. Not many people know that Frankie Valie of the 4 Seasons developed his false setto voice listening to this album.The reason that their are 2 white guys on the album is that black faces were not really selling album covers at this time. The music can be classified as ""race music"" just prior to the rock and roll explosion.If you are a Doo Wop fan, and you want to hear the original deal, that is the people that started it all, this is the album for you."
5,OH WHAT A SOUND,"I attended a concert the other day and these two groups were mentioned, I forgot how great this album was. I did have origional on 33 vinyl(remember them). I had to add this to my doo wop collection again, I also agree why not use cover from the record sleeve."
5,God digs doo-wop and so will you,"As Gus Gossert once said "" God digs doo-wops "" and so will you if you buy this CD. What more can I say that has not already been said about the greatest doo-wop record ever made except that I bought this when it came out on record and remember the famous cover well. As the old saying goes "" if it ain't broke ....don't fix it "" Nobody "" changed or modernized "" these songs . They were kept as they were originally issued. Nobody should "" change or modernize "" this cover. I am glad it was kept as it was originally issued."
5,GREATEST DOO WOP ALBUM EVER!!,"If there was such a thing as HARDCORE DOO WOP, this album would be heavyweight champ.Yeah, what's up with the cover? Looks like it got mixed up with the GAY HITS FOR LEATHERMEN compilation. I think they're suggesting it's HARDCORE DOO WOP. Whatever. It's LAME!! But the music is not. This is what it was all about, friends. SCORE THIS, FOR SURE!! And why not display the CD cover prominently atop your stereo? Get your friends talking.Along with RHINO, COLLECTIBLES puts out great DOO WOP CDs. And this is THE BEST!!Also check out some of their FOR COLLECTORS ONLY series. Especially the 2 Disc DEL VIKINGS and the 2 Disc FLAMINGOS CDs."
4,Chickens roosting on electric fences...,"Neither as momentarily harsh nor as tweakedly democratic as the Kittens' first album (""We Buy a Hammer For Daddy""), nor as Karl-be-Blaked as their Daxless third (""Spoonfed & Writhing""), THE BIG DENTIST staggers forward on ungainly drunken clubfeet through typically Kittenish rants, groaned song-poems, delicate instrumental teratogenesis, and darkly amusing, wholly unexpected sections of early-80s cheap-synth flibbertigibbet. I suppose any finalesque say depends on whose camp you're more in -- Danielle's or Karl's -- but that's probably the inverted rub: the two seem a bit at odds with each other here, and maybe that's why it doesn't entirely stand up against either ""Pop-Eyes"" or ""Paper-Thin Religion."" But it has its moments, and I don't regret owning it at all."
1,This book is a Scientology Propaganda Piece 100%,"As a Health Educator with Master's level training, I took an interest in this book. After reading nearly a third (200 pages) or so of the book, I began to realize that this was a propoganda piece by the enemy of free speech known as the Church of Scientology. Ironically, the Church is not a church nor is there ANY science behind any of their malicious claims and attacks. It may be true that there are abuses within psychiatry, medicine or the mental health fields, AS THERE ARE IN EVERY OTHER PROFESSION INCLUDING THE CLERGY. I strongly advise readers not to buy this cleverly crafted collection of half-truths, misinformation and slander. The internet is a great instrument for exposing the lies and fraud from organizations like ""The Citizens Commission for Human Rights"" which is analogous to Hitler's SS in its assault on psychiatry."
5,how to be in a meeting and not be manipulated,"I certainly agree with all the above reviews, but wanted to add one more bit of information. One of the best parts of the book is her discussion on how parent/teacher meetings can be manipulated so that parents' concerns that are outside the schools interests are not allowed to have impact in a meeting. Eakman goes point by point on how they do it AND how you can speak so as to not be isolated in a meeting. GREAT stuff for any parent trying to work within the system!"
2,Why bother?,"I didn't check the stats too closely on this tool when I ordered it. What I wanted was a worm drive saw that was a bit lighter than the 7-1/4 version. I'm a lefty, and in order to use these saws correctly in a drop cut, I have to hold the saw in my right (somewhat weaker)hand. What I got with the 6-1/2"" version is less cutting depth and exactly the same weight! No other difference! Would somebody please tell me why anybody would buy this saw? Oh, and to top it off, 6-1/2"" blades are hard to find and more limited in selection. Wonderful, next time I'll read the fine print."
2,Keep saving your pennies,"It appears to be a lot of phone for the money, but it's just another cheap 900 MHz analog phone. Its build quality is poor; the handset feels insubstantial. Its keys are tiny and badly labeled. The display is dim and small.The phone's core functions work fine: speakerphone, caller ID on both lines (IDs displayed on the handset only). A belt clip and headphone jack are standard accessories.When you take a call, you find the quality during the call comes and goes. Using this phone in same room as the base, there is a constant, audible sine wave of hiss. Wandering more than a few feet turns the cycling hiss into pops and scratches. With enough distance, I get pieces of others' wireless calls.I traded a much better-built Uniden 900 MHz DSS 2-line phone in for this one because I needed Caller ID. Dumb move. I recommend staying away from anything in Uniden's line that isn't DSS or 2.4 GHz."
3,Great phone except for one problem,"This is a great phone. It had all the features I was looking for -- 2 lines, conf, call waiting, call id, transfer, mute, headset jacks, volume, ringer on/off. The only problem is that you cannot turn off the ringer on the handset. If your talking on one line and another call comes through on the other, it rings loudly in your ear. I called Tech Support and you cannot turn this off -- only to hi or low volume (and 'low' isn't that low). If it weren't for this, I'd recommend it highly."
2,Not a good desk phone!,"I bought this phone with the intention of using it in my home office. The caller-id function is very important to me. Unfortunately, the phone lays to flat for you to see the caller-id display or read the keypad. Also, speakerphone volume is really loud, even when turned all the way down. I am taking this phone back."
4,good phone,This is a good phone for the price. Does what it says it does. The voice quality is clear and nice. 900MHz is less crowded spectrum now as the 2.4G interfered with the wireless routers 802.11b/g. The range is decent. I hope the battery lasts and also I hope it will be durable in the long run.
3,clear phone,"You might not like the price on this, no matter how low the sale is, but you will see it all worth it when it arrives. If you find it hard to hear the other line walking around your house, then I suggest you move. This phone is so clear, when your in the same room with it's charger, it will seem as if you are actully in the same room with your chatter."
5,good saw,"The saw is a really good saw i think that if you are a construction worker then you should get it. All the other saws were not as good as this one because it has a better angel on it, no other saw has the 15 amp motor or the deep cut on the max angel. I am going to go with Bosch i am going to buy a sliding compound saw for a great price! If bosch could only put out another better sliding compound saw then they would sell alot more saws. The bosch saw is the best!"
3,For advanced students,"I am pretty well read on the mystical studies, but this book is very hard to understand. I think it might be good for someone very very advanced."
4,Who would believe a horn could make you dance.,"This CD has a wow factor. Spiritual, inspirational, motivational and exceptional."
1,Ridiculous.,"Should not be sold on Amazon. Not up to date. Tries to be funny, but it's not. Exercises out of date. DVD seems to be from mid-1970's. I returned this. Didn't want it taking up space in my house and was upset with Amazon for not having a better description."
5,Delightful musical bio. of two great composers.,"What a treat to hear the wonderful songs of Kalmar & Ruby played so realistically by Astaire and Skelton. The music composed by these two will be with you after you see the movie. The story of these two is reminiscent of times gone by when ""baseball and magic"" were a favorite past time and the world was in step.Tears came to my eyes listening to these beatiful tunes and watching the enchanting Vera Ellen dance with Fred Astaire.""Give me the good old days.!"
5,three little words,"THIS IS AN EXCELLANT DANCE MUSICAL THAT WAS MADE MANY,MANY YEARS AGO. IT HAS GREAT SONGS LOTS OF HUMOR ANG WONDERFUL DANCING BY NO OTHER THAN FRED ASTAIRE AND VERA ELLEN. IT IS ENJOYABLE FOR ME TO GO BACK IN TIME AND THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE FOR THE OLDER CROWD. ACTUALLY FOR EVERYONE.JOE MAHER"
5,great movie,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Too bad they don't make movies like anymore. No dirty language, no nudity, a movie anyone can watch."
2,Bosch Finish Saw,"I didn't find this saw useful for cuts requiring alot of control. I was hoping to use it to cut out baseboards for cabinet installations, but freehand cuts were not that accurate. With the miterbox, the saw pulled the work into the blade if it was not clamped very securely-- impossible w/ crown mould. Definitely not a substitute for a chopsaw."
1,bogus,"This is actually a review I wrote for the Bosch planer. But as I already had written a previous review It would not allow a 2nd one. So I am writing it here.I think some of these reviews are fake. After cmy problems with this planer I noticed that some of the other reviews were so glowing. so I clicked on "" Ted Peterson"".Surprise, surprise. He has made 8 reviews. All 8 were Bosch products!! All 8 were rated 5 star!! And all 8 were gushy in their praising of Bosch perfection. All 8 repeatedly mentioned the Bosh name and could not find ONE bad thing to mention in the performance of 11 tools. Have you ever bought 11 perfect tools?Same for "" Skip Morris"". 9 reviews. 9 Bosch tools ( and nothing else). Nine 5 star reviews. Nine Bosch love affairs.I think they work for Bosch."
3,Bosch 1640VSK,"If you are making picture frames, installing flooring, crown molding, or base boards then this is the saw you won't want to live without. It leaves a very fine cut, with a little tear out. Not near as much as you get with circular saw type mitre saw. The angles for the included mitre box are dead on accurate. If you want to cut lumber for a woodworking project this is not the tool I would choose. Setting up the saw is quick and easy. Bosch did an excellant job of design in this regard. Two clamps set up the mitre box. The saw fits onto two posts on a hinged tab. A long thumb screw secures the saw to the tab. The only shortcommings to the saw are; small cutting capacity, and vibration (mine has vibrated the clamps loose twice). I'd like to see a wider variety of blades. A metal cutting blade, and a blade with a larger length (for more cutting capacity) seem the logical next step for Bosch to take. Add those two blades and this saw would get 4+ stars from me."
5,TOPSAW for small moldings,"If you are in the business, then you know what a pain it is to set up your dewalt miter saw for punching out apartmenst or any area for second trim (shoe molding or scribe molding). This tool is the one for that job. I have owned three of them. of course it will not do what a top grade miter saw will do. but it is not suppose to. it also works great for thresholds and for trimming doors for flooring. i am in the fire and water restoration business and i believe you will find this tool very helpful."
4,Lownes history,"Book is based on a collection of my Grandfathers, and I wanted a bit of family history in my household. the book is pretty dog eared, and other family members I found like new elsewhere. I'm just glad to have a copy, send so few were printed. getting the book was pretty slow but the cost was good."
4,they're not Avis,"This is Collectables, not Ace. That says a lot. If for no other reason than the packaging---THERE ISN'T ANY. This probably keeps they're overhead down and thus the cost to us. But unlike Avis, they do not try harder. Even the Eric ""Hard to Find"" series gives some data and prose about the selections and their price is more affordable than Ace. But Ace to me is supreme and I'll spend the extra money.Well, I actually do think Collectables have improved their recording process for these sound a little better than I expected. Still not crystaline but better.Now the songs are good. I bought it simply to get Be Fair by the Pipes on CD. I once had the 45 and found myself longing to hear the song again. Half of the others are too common to need this disc but there are some that don't show up elsewhere or often. All in all the stars are ONLY for the songs. There would be none for the packaging."
1,Cheap crapola!,"Nabu Press need to have a foot placed rapidly into a particular part of their anatomy.They have taken a free, i.e. in the public domain, and reproduced this magnificent work in a tardy fashion. Don't buy this. It can be downloaded at Clarinet Institute of L.A. free.Then print it off on your printer. Anything will be better than this trashy effort at 'publishing'.It's unbelievable that Amazon gave the nod for it to be sold on their site. The crassness of it is breathtaking.Quite apparently both Nabu and Amazon have no respect for the very serious work that went into writing this remarkable opus.It is an insult to writers and publishers in general, and to Carl Baermann in particular.Shame on you both."
2,poor battery,I got my replacement saw in march.(the first one I THOUGHT WAS A JOKE)..but the replacement was the same.very dissapointing for Panasonic...the reviews stated it would cut 320 2x4 on a single charge.try 50 !!both saws did about 50 2x's and back to the charger..I may as well have bought the Ryobi got 2 baterries and saved $150 ..my older Panasonic tools were way better..I got a LOW BID tool for a high bid price..
1,BAD,"Still wish Amazon would allow 0 stars, I didn't want to do this review because I'm embarrassed that I bought this. So as punishment I am forcing my self to write this. BAD BAD BAD Don't fall for the hype about this being a classic retro movie from the ""70"". Its a total waist of time. Bad everything, acting,script,film quality, The other reviewer gave it 2 stars. WHY? WHY? WHY?"
3,Better than anticipated,"This movie is better than I anticipated. There was almost a decent plot to support the film, as well as some mediocre character development. But the point is that it isn't a horrible movie. While it isn't the best movie, there is an attractive and interesting quality about the storyline-which is to rescue a kidnapped girl. There was a lack of strong character development, but in the same token the audience finds out what they need to know for the characters to fit the plot well. Overall, it is worth purchasing and watching."
2,The Guns of Brixton,"I'm not necessarily a fan of rap. However, I would hope that Cypress Hill gives the Clash credit for the instrumental arrangements in the song ""What's Your Number"". If you listen to the reggae influenced rock single ""The Guns of Brixton"" on The Clash's hit album ""London Calling"" you will find that the instrumental arrangements are identical (with the exception of the rap lyrics included). I would be deeply disturbed if such a menial ""gangsta"" rap group should not give proper credit to the revolutionary alternative rock group that composed the original arrangement to this piece."
5,A really good book,"This book is a great read. I have purchased it at least 5 times and then I lend it out and do not get it back as it gets passed around. I am going to buy another one, its really a wonderful book about growing up. Well written and a quick read.Everyone I know that has read it, loves it."
3,MASTER PUPPETEER,"I think this book was a great example of historical fiction and Japanese literature. It gave great insight into the life of a typicla Japanese boy during this century. It discussed the social ills of that time period and the problems the average Japaneese family faced. It showed the hardships that this young boy faced. More importantly however, I think it gave a good description of the Japaneese theater and its operations.The only drawback to this is that for most readers who are unfamilar with the Japaneese customs and cultures, it doesn't proovide much insight. it was difficult to relate to some of the situations faced by the young boy. I think if you have a background that suits Japaneese culture you can appreciate this book a lot more."
4,The Master Puppeteer,"This book called The Master Puppeteer is about a poor boy name Jiro. Jiro is trying to help is father, so the family won't starve to death. The family needs money to keep alive because back then, things were not that well. A lot of people were in hunger, it is up to Jiro to help out with business. Jiro and his family are in the city of Osaka, that is in Japan. Jiro tris to at a theater and make puppets for the a theater, but sadly Jiro is too clumsy for the job.There are also friendships and courage along this story...I enjoy reading this book, because he shows me more about Japan and the people who lives there..."
3,Good figures of speech a little boring though.,The character's are fairly beleivable and the setting seems resonable. I thought that this book was a little boring.
5,Excellent Mystery!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I read this book in one of my classes in school, I thought it was an Amazing book!!!! When a boy goes to work for a master puppeteer, he wouldn't expect so many things to happen!! I don't know if anyone would! Taking place in Japan, this book is full of wonderful suprises that I think that anyone who loves a good mystery would enjoy. The Master Puppeter is a superb book."
1,Pretty awful book,"Our 6th grade language arts class had to read this book, and it was pretty horrible. I found it boring and I couldn't get myself to continue reading it, other than the fact that it was a school assignment. I highly do not recommend this book."
2,"Not very good, boring","This book was assigned to me for school, and it never really drew me in. Good detail about Japan, though. Otherwise, I wish I didn't have to read it."
5,The best book on the teaching of the Bible on the afterlife,"This book by Dr. Robert Morey is in my opinion the best argument in print on the biblical teaching of the life after death. I did use it extensively when writing a major technical paper at the teological faculty of the University of Aarhus, Denmark. The subject for the paper was an investigation of the arguments used by the socalled ""annihilationists"" (for example John Stott, Clark Pinnock, John Wenham, Michael Green, Fudge, the Seventh Say Adventists and Jehovas Witnesses). I read nearly every book I could find on this subject in danish, norwegian, swedish, german and english. Many of these books did provide good and strong arguments but no one did outrange this book by Dr. Robert Morey. Morey takes the arguments of the annihilationists one by one and demolishes them totally. By this book NOW - before it goes out of print! Klaus Dahl, Denmark"
5,Outstanding,"What does the Bible say about death and eternity? Who'll be resurrected, and to what end? Will everyone be saved, or might some people simply pass into non-existence upon death? This book explores these subjects in depth, comparing biblical teachings to other views from the occult to the universalist."
5,A must read for anyone who has questions about what happens when you die,"I will preface this review by saying that I am a big fan of anything and everything I have ever read by Robert Morey. His theology is Biblically sound and his statement of faith is nearly identical to my own. This book serves as a good primer to anyone who has broad questions about what happens when you die, what other cultures believe, and what the Bible says about it. If you have other more specific questions, Morey has written other more specific books such as Reincarnation and Christianity."
3,Golden Classics,I bought cd for just one song basically. i really don't care for the rest of the CD. good buy for the price.
4,"work well, look good",I'm very happy with these locks on my windows (an old New Orleans house) - they provide security and look good.The only issue i had was that they were all packaged together in a plastic bag with no directions or anything information provided.
5,"Good company, Good Cartridge",Hey Hewlet Packard is a great company with great products. I have a Apollo P-1200 printer and instead of paying 40.00 for this cartridge in stores I pay 31.00 for it here. The cartridges (both color and black last forever so don't worry about running out of ink with a little heavy printing. I got my printer back in June of 1999 and this is the end of September and it's nowhere near gone. I have printed over 400 sheets. It's a good product and a good company. Cartrages never leak ink and there easy to install. Definitely worth the money.
3,bought two pack ink cartridge -one quit working after a week,bought two pack ink cartridge -one quit working after a week even though there were plenty of ink still in it. Also: no way to return empty cartridges.
5,Mess-up cleaned-up!,"The provider of the ink cartridge messed-up and sent me the wrong product, but after contacting them, they corrected the order and I had it in a couple days (correct ink) and a return mailer to send the wrong ink back at no shipping cost to me. That was impressive!Tim Arnold"
3,Black ink for my Apollo P-1200 and it's works!!!,"I buy this black ink for my old Apollo P-1200. I have it in a box for a long time. But i need aditionals printers for my post-grade tesis and i print a lot of previews. I try to give my apollo to my childs and i take my deskjet 3200 for real stuff. Its a lot of ink for my kids but a little slow for them. The cartrige comes very good packed and i put inmediatelly in the old printer and after configuring the resolution came to life again.The only bad point is that the delivery get a lot of hits and when i put out of the package i get spots of ink in my hands, after cleaned was ok."
1,woooooo,"It was brocken when I recived it . It's amazing, I just lose my money. No way to return it besause I was in Sotuh America when I open it."
5,HP26 Ink Cartridge,"I have previously refilled cartridges or purchased ""remanufactured"" cartridges. After several problems, I only purchase NEW cartridges through Amazon, where I get the best prices -- good enough to outweigh alleged savings on reffils, refubs or remanufactured cartridges."
3,Out of date ink cartridges HP 26 black,I ordered the twin pack of HP 26 Black Ink cartridges via Amazon because the printer I use (HP Deskjet 540) is totally out of date and the ink is no longer in stores. At least I saved myself the cost of a new printer for a while. They work fine so far.
1,defective item,I received a defective and expired item. I ordered a twin pack and received a single pack. I contacted the vendor immediately. That was back in mid-December. I am still waiting to receive my money back...it was a very bad experience.
1,Wasted time and money,The ink cartridge arrived with no problems. Opened up the package and the cartridge was bone dry. It had leaked and then dried. When I tried to remove the plastic that covered the ink head the copper contact tore right off. Needless to say I was a little upset. I just threw it in the garbage. I didn't want to waste anymore time or money trying to find a replacemnet.
2,Performs well but very difficult to refill,"I wasted a whole bottle of ink trying to refill this thing. I refilled it, waited about 15 minutes, then put it back in the printer. Overnight all the ink leaked out. I got it all over the inside of the printer, me, and even on the floor. It's a special ""anti-refill design"" by HP. Search the internet well before trying to refill this as it's very difficult."
1,HP 26 Cartridge,"I should have been suspicious with such a low price. The cartridge arrived quickly enough, but after opening the package, ink was leaking inside of the foil wrap. Ink on the pen tip had dried to chunk of blackness.A date stamped on the outside of the cartridge was March 2005. This was a totally useless purchase."
1,HP 26,"Cartrige I received expired in 2006 and had leaked all over the place. The description said that it was a new cartridge. Now i know why it only cost 1.94. The shipping was around 4.95. I just threw it away, did bother returning it."
1,Ink Cartrige,Ink covered and it did not work in my HP scanner. Never again.I can not recommend this product to anyone. Buyer beware. Buyonly new products. Now my scanner is inoperable.
4,The New Ofra Haza!!,"After the sad news that shocked many people that were hypnotized by the Yemenite singer Ofra Haza, I suddenly find a refuge and relief in Yosefa. I am thankful to god that the hope is still alive.If you are familiar with Ofra's music, this CD was cooked in the same kitchen. Only those who enjoy meditative, or world music, will definitely enjoy this album. All tracks are basically modernized Arabic/Middle Eastern beats (combined with disco and bop). The music is not ethnicly pure or intensively composed by humans, rather in a studio and by machines. However, you'll still going to be hypnotized and meditated by Yosefa's Yemeni-dialect, exotic and angle-like voice.Tracks I extremely recommend are: 2, 3, 4 (Yarayah), 6, and 8; especially track 4, Yarayah.I hope that Yosefa follows our beloved Ofra Haza's path. I can definitely see her as the New Ofra Haza."
2,Passe product.,Use of this filters is something of the past. Photoshop makes easier work correction after picture taken. Digital era is on.
4,The thing to have,"It's small and unobtrusive and just the thing you need with your heavy Milwaukee, say while up on a ladder. I am buying one for my Hitachi framing nailer as well.Just about everyone I know who owns either tool also owns the hanger.It's worth the money in aggravation from not having to look for a safe place to set either tool down."
3,Hitachi NR90AE modification,"Amazon recommended this after I bought a Hitachi NR90AE round head framing nailer. Toolhangers Unlimited makes a hanger for this particular nailer, but this isn't it. It will work, if you drill a hole in the nail magazine so you can use two bolts to secure the hanger. Make sure the bolts you use have heads which won't rub the nails in the magazine."
3,Had to buy my own screws at ace.,"the part came labeled for a hitachi nail gun. the holes were too close together to line up with the skilsaw. I had to bore 1 hole out maybe 1/8"" to line up. Then I had to go to ace and buy my own screws, the screws that came were to bolt onto a nailer. 1/2 hour later it works great."
4,"4 Stars for the move, 5 Stars for Robert Patrick","I was quite surprised by this movie - I never heard of it before, and going thru the movie section of the TV guide, decided to tape it since I saw it had Robert Patrick...I forgot I had it until several months later, and started watching it one morning while I was getting ready for work. I got so involved in it I was late! Some things are really weird, in a funny sort of way, but the end total took me off guard. Not an Oscar winner, but if you like Robert Patrick, this is a definite buy."
2,Out of proportion,The dress could be quite stunning but is not made with usable proportions. The band that goes around the waist is exxtremely small while the rest of the dress fits nicely. I am a petite 5'5 weighing 115 lbs and the waist is uncomfortably tight on me. I am having it altered.
3,"OK, but the Nimbus Recording of the Symphonies is Better","Having previously heard the Weber Symphonies by the Hannover Band under Roy Goodman on NImbus, I was somewhat disappointed by this release (I subsequently ordered the Nimbus). Somehow, I sense a certain lack of enthusiasm in these renditions, a lack of drive and sparkle, compared to the Goodman. I don't think it is a matter of Goodman's use of period instruments, but of sheer involvement with the music. Of course, this disc does offer other rather rarely played Weber pieces, and mainly accounts for the value of this set. But, regarding the symphonies, they sound here like charming but rather unmomentous works by an operatic composer; under Goodman, they sound like great symphonies in the late classic style, actually better constructed examples of sonata form than much of Schubert's symphonic works. Get the Goodman, by all means."
4,Great book for all ages,"This was a great book, fun to read and the pictures were awesome. Only thing I would change is give more of a description on some of the animals discussed breifly while creating a image for the readers, otherwise top notch."
1,doesn't do it's job,"I had to hold the object I try to glue together for a long 5 minutes, and it doens't stick !so I make a test on a separate piece and found out....This glue can't even glue regular ass papers together !the only thing it's capable of gluing is its own dispenser cap."
2,GLUE,I recommend that you purchase larger sizes of this glue. The glue is a very good all purpose glue but in the small containers it gets clogged and is not easily dispensed - in fact I had to remove the cover to use it.
2,No big deal.,My picture bracket fell down so I tried this stuff. I waited the recommended time then put my breakfast tray up. It fell down right away.
4,Excellent Phone,"I tried a Bell South, AT&T and Sony phone and then choose to try this phone after investigating reviews on the internet. For the price, this is an excellent phone. It has a clearer reception than any of the above brands I mentioned about and the Bell South and AT&T phone was a 2.4 MHZ. Very easy to operate without having to push several buttons to delete caller ID. Nice clear answering machine. If it had a light that blinked when a person called or an alert it would be Superior in my opinion. In a nutshell, I'm a satisfied customer with this phone and believe you would be also."
2,Fuzzy reception,"Phone, caller id and answering machine are all very easy to use, but it is fuzzy. I had the Panasonic 900mhz. It was very clear in comparison. I'm returning this one and getting a Panasonic."
3,Excellent sound quality but wobbly performances,"The bargain price, excellent sound quality, rarity of the repertoire, and the use of an instrument tuned to the antique style of ""mean tone"" temperament on this recording make it attractively tempting.A frustrating drawback, alas, is that the playing is very wobbly with tempo and rubato fluctuating almost continuously. While the latter approach is appropriate to the Prelude-like movements on the program (after all, Couperin wrote these without specifying rhythmic or metrical values!), it is neither required nor appropriate at all for the dance movements."
4,The first review,"Margaret Forster takes us on a wonderful journey through Catherine's discovery of her dead mother. The 'memory box' her mother leaves her daughter as she dies, when the child is only six months old, reminds us of the importance of personal history and the sense that it gives us all of our grounding in life. The journey that Catherine undertakes leads her to question her own lifestyle and the relationships with her father, stepmother and Tony her boyfriend. To the very end she reconciles her feelings for the mother she tried to ignore and discovers unexpected truths about herself. The box for thirty years enclosed and contained within the attic of her family home, once opened like Pandoras Box, couldnt be closed again. An engaging story which will make you question your history."
3,Disappointing,This is my least favorite of all the Margaret Forster books I have read. I found it very difficult to stay interested in the whole novel and felt that the storyline really didn't go anywhere.
4,Yogo The Great American Sapphire,"Having grown up near this area of Montana, I was familiar with Yogo sapphires, but wanted to know more. The text lays out all the facts and colourful stories about these most glorious gems. It was an interesting and delightful read and I recommend it to anyone interested in history, Montana and especially precious gemstones. It was also a bonus to learn about Charlie Russell's association with the story. He lived in my town."
3,100 Words or Less,"I simply adored each story ... but grew to avoid this collection the more I read.Carver has a way of tearing down each person, removing any sense of security and hope. Reading it once is fascinating. Twice and you begin to see what he's getting at. Three times and the pattern sets in. And then story after story? Ugh. I found myself returning to this collection less and less. It's all too hopeless. Too insecure. Too depressing to the human condition."
2,over-rated,"Raymond Carver is way over-rated. And, as has previously been stated below, he wasn't really the author of his stuff...it was his editor and his wife that were the invisible hands behind him, which is probably why he never wrote a novel. But, if you want a good example of stuff that epitomizes a rather bland chapter in American literature, Carver is your ticket."
5,Short Stories,"Carver was an unusual man with unusual stories mostly based on working class families and relationships. There isn't a story without angst or that doesn't include alcohol, cigarettes or drugs. Some of the stories leave you hanging while others offer a heartbreaking moral."
2,What's the point?,"After every story in the book I just ask myself ""why?"" What a bunch of pointless stories. On the bright side: I wasn't quite bored to tears, and I never launched the book across the room, and it's fairly short. I didn't ever care what happened next, because I knew nothing would (except in ONE story that takes an interesting twist at the end.) I never looked forward to picking up the book, not after the first time anyway."
3,Pills are too small,"The pills are very small - only a fraction of the 1500mg regular size and each contains much less glucosamine than other brands such as Kirkland. The product description is missing and it would really help for customers to know what they are buying. On another side, the price is great."
4,High quality,"I bought this case a few years ago, the quality is no doubt better than any other case I've seen. However, is it the best ever case? Probably not, it's definitely worth the money, that's about it, you get what you pay for. If you want the best case ever, you'll have to pay more than this."
5,Burning with Sansui 4005,I burn my TIVO (VHS) output to these DVD's using a SANSUI 4005 (Sears) and I have yet to make a coaster. Now at 50 cents each I can burn any TV program without worrying about the cost.
1,These DVD's are crap!,"I bought these thinking I was getting a good deal, and maybe 2 out of 5 would work, the others would get a recording error. I don't have any problems with any other brand. I won't by this brand ever again!!"
1,Piece of crap - Don't waste your money,I bought more than 1000 DVD-Rs (Ritek G04 e G05). Only when I begginned to lost my data and study to understand what happens I see that this midia is crap. Burns perfectly ant the first time. As time goes lost the data. I try to contact Ridata manufacturer and they don't answer my e-mails. Buying this DVD-R is like buying trash. Try other manufacturers.
1,Do not waste your money,Very bad quality I tried it with Sony DVD recorder RDR-GX3 every single one has the same problem some of the recording I can't view it at all & the others with very poor quality
1,"Trash, dont buy","bot on 6/12, received on 6/22.i doubt if this disk is G04? or real 4X? the self detected speed is 1.1x only.the on i bot from shop4tech, even can write 2.6x although they all call themselves 4X.BTW, im using NEC2500A lastest version."
3,good price,good price.loud saw.this thing will scream at you.motor is fine.i cut the center of a piece of plywood out in the shape of the tray the saw sits in.set the saw in it and put he whole thing on horses.put the water filler tube in a five gal bucket of water.the guide is the worse piece of s**t i've ever used.good luck its only a 130$ bucks what do you expect.good for the handyman.
5,MK-170 Extreme,"This saw is perfect for the do-it-yourselfer and side job tile guy. Portable, light, and precise. Great for back splash work and floor tile no greater than 16"".RAM"
2,Absolutely useless fence.,"Either plan on feeding everything through this saw freehand or build a jig, but the fence is completely unusable. Not recommended."
3,DOES THE JOB,"This saw does a good job of cutting but the attachment of the saw to the base is weak.the four screws will not stay tight. The pump water tube routing could be better,but it Does well for the money"
3,Disappointment,"Product is not up to the advertisement onAmazon. This identical tile saw is somewhat cheaperon other tool sites. The shipping costs on Amazon weresatisfactory, however.For the money, the quality product should be higher. HomeDepot sells the same saw for $94. NO shipp[ing required.Check it out!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"I am a residential contractor that purchased this saw for a small tile job (about 300 sf). Because we usually sub out our tile work, we didn't want to invest in a higher priced saw. As a professional contractor, I depend on my tools to perform well. I would have to say that I was disappointed in this tool. While I realize that this is a low price tile saw, I thought that MK only made good tools. There are a few reasons I didn't like this unit:1. The fence system is terrible2. It is difficult to get a straight cut.3. Slow.........Having said all this, I give the unit 2 stars because it might be a good option for DIY'ers that are doing a small remodeling project and don't want to invest in a higher priced saw. I also think that compared to the other units in this price range, this saw gives you more for your money. As for myself, I am in the market for more professional tool. Hope this helps..."
1,"MK-170 7"" Tile Saw","Do not BUY this saw. Yes, it does cut tile but there are serious problems with its design:1. The Rip Fence is sooooo cheesy and in combo with the dimpled table surface becomes problematic for setting it straight.2. The dimpled table is not only annoying but can be difficult when trying to move tiles smoothly while cutting.3. There's NO 45 degree jig for such cuts that are frequently needed in most tile jobs.No wonder MK Diamond stopped making this saw!"
3,Good for hidden cuts,"Saw cuts 3/8"" floor gres fully vitrified tile, a tile which laughs at carbide blades. The table is dimpled, I'm not sure why, and that makes smooth cuts a bit more difficult for tiles with an adhesion pattern on back. If your cuts are going to be highly visible, like matching a 45 degree to wood, this saw might not be the best. Otherwise, it works very well. Can ""machine"" semicircle cuts into the floor gres tiles. Really, quite adequate for most homeowner uses in my opinion. Saw is well built, but fence is a flimsy plastic item, works OK but marginal."
4,Home Hobbyist,"This is a great little saw for the ""Do It Yourselfer"". I give it 4 stars. I bought it for my bathroom and kitchen ceramic tile installation. It's ready to go right out of the box. Just install the supplied blade and connect the water pump supply tube. I suggest you buy a quality blade with your purchase. The supplied blade cuts well but after about 25 cuts it began chipping the edge of the tile. Free hand cuts are a breeze but I did not find the rip fence user friendly at all. It needs to be re-designed. I'm satified with the purchase and I would recommend it.The Pro's- It's a great price- Well built- Very portable and easy to use- Compact and powerfulThe Con's- The guide fence is useless."
3,Large Blade Travel,"I was dissapointed to find that although the blade that shipped with the saw appeared to be flat, the amount of travel (wobble) when cutting is twice the thickness of the blade. The result is a much wider cut than expected, more lost material and (of course) more wear on the blade. I have not tried a different blade yet, and although this blade appears flat and true I need to try a new blade to confirm."
2,Where do I begin?,"The rip fence is absolutely useless, your only chance to get a good cut is to use a square and manually hold the square or clamp it down while you push the tile throughthe motor mount is not a clean 90 degree angle as well, the weight of the motor bends the frame and the tile blade is not perpendicular to what it is cutting and bogs down because of too much friction and a lack of motor powerI was so frustrated with this saw that the same day I drove to Lowes and bought a real tile saw for $300+The only reason I am giving the tile saw more than 1 star is because it is a fair price for what you get, for the small tile saws under $150 it is typical, my advice is to avoid all these low end saws where you have to use your hand to push the tile and get a tile saw with a tray or a moving bridge, if you must get a cheap tile saw get one where the blade is under mount like a table saw"
3,Poor design of the fence,I just finished my first job with the product. As I was required to make several different cuts on this remodeling job I found the fence provided to be a piece of junk. First of all it was too narrow and the clamps on either end took too much time to set. I made my own which was two pieces of metal welded together at 90 degrees one fitting in the slot. the other end was clamped with a simple hand clamp. This worked well and I was able to change the fence rapidly. Outside of the fence problem the saw works well especially for the price. Would I buy it again yes indeed.
2,"Ok for the money, but fence sucks!","Purchased saw from Amazon, and arrived in a few days with free shipping, which was great....thanks Amazon! Completed a bath renovation by installing 12"" marble tiles around tub and floor. Makes pretty clean cuts, but a little slow. Big downside is the fence adjustment, very difficult to slide fence and expect square cuts, like the previous reviewer I needed to measure everytime I adjusted, plus fence track on the rear is too close to the plastic pan and binds fence when trying to adjust. Got so frustrated, ended up cutting many tiles free hand. All in all, good for a small DIY project. You get what you pay for."
4,Good Saw for Medium size Projects,"I purchased this saw to cut 16x16 inch tiles. Here are some of my recomendations...1. The first thing I recommend is to get a new high quality stone cutting blade. This is a must. The provided blade is ok, but after a few cuts, you notice the dullness coming out.2. Purchase an additional extension for the water pump. The provided tubes are a little short. Clean water for the pump is a must!3. Lastly, I dumped the little white tub and used a tall kitchen trash can and set the saw on top. I got tired of dumping the old water all the time :).The motor on this little guy, is awesome. Another gentlemen complained about the rip guide fence, I found that making a line on my actual tile, was better. And the bubbled table top, well, turn the tile upside down and it glides very smoothly. making your cut line with a good carpenters pencil on the bottom side of the tile, will usually not come off when the water hits it anyways.Hope this helps!"
1,Defective - Crooked blade,"Judging from the reviews so far I think I might have had a defective product. As I took it out of the box and put everything together I thought it was decent but after wasting a couple of expensive tiles I realized it was the blade causing issues, not the fence or operator error. The blade was off 1/4"" from one end to the other. The motor assembly mount of the holding bracket looks to be welded crooked. I would give this another try but I don't have time to return this and wait for a new one.Just make sure to check that the blade is straight before you get into a tile project!"
1,Screws Stripped,Saw arrived with stripped screw holes where saw attaches to base. Saw is held to base with 4 screws that thread into plastic ONLY. Returned.
5,WET SAW,"This saw is well worth the money.Just finished a slate floor 12 x12 tiles with no problem.Light weight,portable,compact.Great for the do it DIY.Saw does move sometimes when cutting but not a major problem.Had no problem with the fence on my saw.Just read the set up instructions and you'll be fine.Pump hose is short,went to store & picked up a 10 foot hose for $2.00.As long as your Patient and measure properly the saw is perfect."
3,Not very thorough,This book is good but Not very thorough. It contains a lot a basic knowledge. I was looking for more in depth information as how to shoot a cannon. Some of the pictures were very old - they could have been touched up?
4,Nice overview,"A short and sweet primer on Civil War Artillery, great photos and illustrations. Would be a must read for anyone interested in Civil War History."
3,BASIC REVIEW,this short book is a basic review of Artillery of the Civil war peroid. The book does not go in depth to tactics. It is some use wargamers as ranges for weapons are given.
3,No closed Captions,"I loved the movie, but had to got to Net Flex to watch it. I returned this DVD because it had no closed captions. I am deaf."
4,"""Into the West""","This is an absolute delight.I could not imagine anyone not liking this movie. Only the Irish can make movies like this.Two beautiful kids, a great horse, Gabriel Byrne at his best and a mystical fairy story atmosphere to go along with. This is a beautiful movie."
5,great,"This is a great story about modern-day gypsies or travelers, as they're known in Ireland, and the hardships faced by two brothers when their dad decides to quit the traveling life, but can't adapt. How the boys manage to survive and what happens when their grandfather brings a horse with him on his next stop in town, makes for a truly magical little story. I enjoyed it with my older grandaughter when she was around 8 or 9, and, since I couldn't find it to rent, was happy to find it here for such a reasonable price, and look forward to sharing it with her little sister on their next visit."
4,"Great Movie, But Rather Violent","I and my children loved this movie, however I'd like to caution parents who have smaller/sensitive/impressionable children. The movie has quite a few violent spots and the ""authority figures"" display a LOT of bigotry. The bigotry the police have towards the gypsies is prevalent throughout the entire movie and there are some spots where they brutalize the children's father as well as the horse. If your children are sensitive towards animal suffering or physical violence, you might want to view the movie by yourself first and then make sure you sit with them or skip those parts.Overall, great movie -- just take care with the viewing."
4,west dvd,I bought this for my grand daughter and she absolutley loved it she she she cried while watching it because it was such a good movie
4,Excellent,A wonderful story of spirit the pursuit of freedom and coming to terms with loss along with a reawakening of deep roots
4,nothing,"hello, please i don't want to explain any thing but i want to have the web or e-mail of Elissa's star. thank you.elssy baddour, journalist"
2,Don't know what I ever saw in this movie.,"I loved this movie when I was a kid. I even named my first dog Chomps. Recently I bought the dvd and watched it for the first time in 20 years. It's awful. Bad acting, mediocre story, lame special effects (to be expected for the time period), I couldn't even get my 6yr old nephew to sit through it. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and rent it before you buy it."
1,"wow, pretty bad.","this must have the worst opening credit segment ever. A horrible derivitive of the pink panther. If you make it through that, you've watched too much already.Although it is interesting to see how bad a movie can be. The sounds effects & music are just plain awful.Pros: Valerie Bertinelly looks good & so does the Porsche 914, although it is white"
2,This movie made me cry!,"This movie should have had a PG rating on this film. I saw some of this when I was 8 years old. When Brian would take the dog's head off, I would scream out for my mom and then start to cry. The scenes where his eyes light up could scare little kids... Take it from me, I know...I would advise parents to pre screen this before letting them see this movie. Seeing this film today still gives me the shakes! and I am now 30! Bed memories die hard...."
5,great movie,Want a great action comedy? Get this movie! It is hilarious original and a classic. Charlie sheen and Chris Tucker make me laugh every time I watch it.
3,Reminds me of White-Out,Ehh...I wasn't too impressed with this polish. It looked like White-Out on my nails and chipped/peeled very easily. I guess I expected it to be a little more sheer and not so chalky white looking.
1,do not order from them,"I ordered this item and it arrived damaged. I had to write 2 emails until I received a response. The second got me a response that said they will send a new bottle. After 2 weeks, no nailpolish. I contacted them again but no word. I had to file a claim through Amazon. Amazon contacted them and they issued a refund. Not worth the effort, better suppliers I'm sure exist."
3,A Book of Singing Proverbs,"This book is a collection of notes of Giovanni Lamperti, an Italian voice teacher. Although there are some gems in here, I would recommend other books first on singing (Clifton Ware and Richard Miller, to start). First, since the notes were compiled after his death, they can often seem unrelated and ambiguous. Here's one: ""Do not 'hold' your tone, spin it. Hold your breath."" If notes like these help you envision singing or how it should be taught, then this book is for you."
3,"Descent, but not really standalone",This book was descent. It covered most of the material on the CNA exam. I have not yet taken any CNE tests. The disks left some to be desired and the book actually left a few things out. I don't recomend this book as your only resource for the CNA or CNE exams.
2,2 great fighters not fighting,I love jet li movies and am starting to get into Jason Statham movies because they both do action movies in a great way. This movie can't be called an action movie because there was none of it
5,War,This movie is very good it had an all star cast like you would not believe there are some stars in this movie which has not gotten to american audiences yet but be on the look out for a young man name Kane Kosugi.Kane is awesome i wish the scene with him and jet li was a little longer but it was still good anyway.I really love this movie.
3,DVD is Full Screen Version,"I haven't actually watched this movie yet so I can't attest to the content. I was however, very disappointed when I pulled it out of the box and saw that it was the Full Screen version of the film only. The item description doesn't specify which usually means the DVD carries both versions."
4,I was entertained...,"I really enjoyed this movie. I went in expecting a violent action film and that is exactly what I got. A popcorn flick. Yes, the camera could get annoying, but not enough to ruin it (certainly no more than the jerking camera in Bourne Supremacy). Statham and Li fight their way to an ending that, for once, was not completely predictable. There was a GREAT twist in the plot - yes! there was a plot - at the end that improved the overall experience of the film. I was happy that the filmakers didn't feel the need to tone it down for a PG-13. Sometimes, a movie just needs to be R; like this one.My criteria for a good movie is simple - was I entertained? YES. Then again, I thoughtCrank (Widescreen Edition)was entertaining too, if you don't take it too seriously. I would watch this again, once the DVD comes down to a reasonable price ($19.99 for a DVD with no special extras is too much)."
3,Movie is OK; blu-ray solid,"Not the top tier of movies that Jet Li is in for the story line. I'm not so fond of gangster / mafia type of movies, but this will appeal to the fans of genre. Lots of actions but pretty gruesome graphics for the killings.The blu-ray picture quality is very good for hi-def. Surround is above average as well. The encoding has a good balance of being soft normally, and sufficient loudness during action scenes to not need to manually turn up the volume."
3,"I admit, I watched it for Jason Statham","...and he did shoot a lot of people, so it was the action-packed kind of movie you've come to expect from him (I read rumors about there being a movie where he didn't shoot someone!). But it was also a 'who is the bad guy, really?' kind of movie that kept you guessing and wondering.The ending was, in a lot of ways, pretty unresolved. You have an idea of what happened - perhaps - but there was also a little bit of wiggle room. It's not completely clear (I can't say much else without giving away too much plot!). So if you need a very clear-cut ending, with no dangling strings, this movie will drive you crazy. If you like that little bit of 'what if?', then this movie is great.Mostly it was a very violent shoot'em up action thriller, nothing more, nothing less. Forgettable, but fun while you're watching it. I'd recommend it to people who like mindless action flicks."
4,War review,"JetLi and Jason- what a combination, their engrossing (film) personalities and their acting skills make this an enjoyable action flick."
3,Disappointed....,"Jason Statham...LOVE HIM! Jet Li...LOVE HIM! I picked this up and thought....how could this go wrong. Obviously, I was disappointed. What could have been a great action/martial arts movie was tepid. As someone else mentioned Jet Li had little spark, which is unusual for him, and when/if you see this the twist will give you pause. He should have been angry, rightous, but I didn't get any of that.Statham had some moments, and I will say the ending irked me being a fan of his, but the last five minutes of the movie...just seemed to pat.If you like Statham see Crank. A Li fan see Unleashed, BUT if you have a few hours and are bored, you could do worse."
4,Great for Jet Li fans. So so for others,"I strongly agree with the majority of reviewers here that this movie cant satisfy most of the target audience who expect violent confrontations between Li and Statham. However, as a fan of Li, I like the movie much for its extremely stylish depiction of Li as the very intelligent and nearly invincible assasin who knows strategy. I like the plot, too, but I wont ruin your interest by disclosing it. Despite the not so promising ratings here, I suggest you to rent it for a good entertainment after dinner. The rental and your valuable time will be well paid back."
3,7.1 Soundtrack,"I brought this title for a training event. It was one of only a few that actually has a legit 7.1 channels of sound. While the movie itself was ""so-so"", the disc has a good menu and very comprehensive. I did find that the disc heavily uses flash menus and this made the menu navigation a little jerky, but this is a player thing. I found that A PS3 navigates these menu's easily.If you want to have a 7.1 surround sound track and have a receiver that can handle it, this is a good disc. I couldn't say that there was one track I used as they are all a little lame, but if you hunt through, you can 'A-B' some good bits..."
4,Good action movie.,"This movie has everything you are looking for in an action movie: A villian, a vendetta, martial arts, plenty of gun fights, car chases, yakuza tattoos, chicks, ninjas and assasins, awesome cars and a twist in the plot. What more could you ask for??? The best part of this movie was in fact the casting.After reading these negative reviews on here, I decided to judge for myself. I was impressed. You would expect more martial arts in this movie, however the blend of Asian gangsterism and concepts of honor were enough to make up for the lack of chop-suey. The plot was a good one: revenge and vendetta ... going to get the bad guys.I really have no bad things to say about this movie. It was a really good action film with a cool plot and very good characters. I mean what do you expect? If you want to see martial arts you can view one of the many hundred films out there. This is a shoot em up action film that does not relent."
2,"It was ok, not what I expected!","Any opportunity to watch Jet Li and Jason Statham I take it, although I was not willing to pay to see it in the theater. Why do that when I can watch it on By Demand! Anyway, I find Jason Statham extremely sexy and looked forward to him dueling the ever talented Jet Li (who I simply love in most of his action adventure/epic movies). I also liked them in The One, which was a decent movie. But the big showdown that I was waiting for just never materialized.Statham, a federal agent is out for vengeance after his partner was killed following a bust. The story picks up three years later when Statham finds evidence that the elusive killer is still alive. The story is predictable and the showdown between the ""good guy and bad guy"" never materializes. I kept waiting for some really good martial arts scenes, and although there were a few they were far and inbetween.This movie a lot of potential, I am just not sure if it delivered."
3,double cross,"As mentioned above two FBI parteners working together and then Jason Strathams partner's family was murdered. AS the assasin Rogue's activities are followed and two corrupt gangland opposing family groups are being murdered; the story narrows down to just two persons. Jason Statham FBI personage and the assasin, Rogue (Jet Lei).Then the suprise ending! There was an ""AAAAHHH"" from the audience. It was a good movie, but others of their movies were better.Et tu Brutus?!"
1,One major problem,"The problem with this movie is that you take two FANTASTIC martial arts stars, put them in a movie together ... AND GIVE THEM GUNS.There should have been unbelievable fight scenes in this, and there were none. I can endure a movie being bad if it at least has good fight scenes, but man, what the hell were the producers THINKING?!"
2,Huge disappointment,"I usually like films which star either Jason Stratham or Jet Li, but I found this one virtually unwatchable. The story is really mediocre and can't be carried by the action sequences. In the very first scene of the movie you can't even make out what the characters are saying since they are mumbling almost unintelligibly. What was the director thinking?Stratham has recently had a string of poor films and this continues the trend. Not sure if it is his problem (just looking for quick bucks after some successful films) or screenwriters and directors.I can't recommend it even to Jet Li fans."
2,Expected a lot and got very little,"This poorly directed movie is also a big letdown as the viewer is looking for an epic fight between the two biggest martial arts stars that never really happens (they fight uninspired for about 30 seconds). There was also the possibility of either star taking on the female martial artist from Sin City and that never happens either.In this one Statham is an FBI Agent who is hunting Rogue (Li), an assassin who supposedly killed his partner and partner's family. Rogue seems to switch sides between the Yakuza and the Triads and also seems to have ample opportunities to kill Statham but never does. When all is explained in the end, you will leave the movie shaking your head.Statham is not the likeable character that he was in the Transporter films and that also really detracts from any enjoyment I may have gotten out of this movie. Better to wait for this to end up on cable than to buy it."
1,cr^p,This movie sucks. It's not a Jet Li movie. Jet li has some bs small parts in the movie. Jet Li should have gotten a lot more time in that movie. It's not a good martial arts movie.
5,Jet Li,"Jet Li is always on fire, and Jason Stratom is good too. I enjoyed this action flix and would encourage others who like action to view it."
3,war,"coud be in english language a lot of fighting,good acting by actors and people who helped produce picture. can be better"
3,War,"Not only was this moving action packed as I expected, but the story line was good also. I think it's one to keep in your collection."
2,Jet Li showing his age,"Put 2 of the big names in martial arts and you should be able to make a decent or at least, entertaining movie. Sadly, no. Storyline is exceptionally stupid and action scenes are dull with Jet mostly plodding through and Jason mostly screaming. Only thing interesting in the movie was the car Jet Li was driving."
1,the camera sucks,"I hated this movie, I almost always love movies with Jet Li or Jason Stathamin them but I hated this one, why? you may ask, here's why: the camera. the camera jumped & jiggled so much during the fights you couldn't tell what was going on, & it's an action movie which you watch for the fighting, right? well if you aren't able to see what happened it's basically just an action movie without action. when the cops were held at gun point in the restaurant (I think it was a restaurant) & they started to fight their way out & the women stabbed 1 of the bad guys it looked to me like she was the one who got stabbed, so in my opinion the movie sucks, just like Bourne Supremacy"
5,A Great movie,"War is one of the best movies of it's kind. It has action, adventure, suspense, plot twists, violence, blood, great martial art fighters BUT most of all it has a great (as always) JET LI who is bruce lee successor in my humble opinion.If u liked romeo must die, kiss of the dragon, hero, unleased and fearless then don't rent this dvd. BUY IT."
2,A Staggering Plot Twist ...,"The main draw of the movie, the action, is not very satisfying ... lots of shooting and running, not enough Jet vs. Jason. But there is a HUGE and devious plot twist which almost makes this movie worth watching."
3,Asian Flavored Usual Suspects,"It's like the movie Usual Suspects with Yakuza and Triads included.Movie is exciting and a good amount of special features makes it a good DVD to buy. If you just like Jetli kicking butt or have interest in asian gang culture, get it. The twist in this movie is what makes this movie worth watching.Now for the bad. Terrible Terrible japanese. The quality of Japanese spoken in this movie is hilarious especially from Devon Aoki. I mentioned the twist was great, but then the director went too far with it that made it a bad ending.Overall, I'd say rent it, don't buy it."
3,quite gruesome,The story line was good but a bit too much blood and guts for my taste. it could have been toned down a bit.
2,A drama made with action stars,"There was some action but the movie was mainly a drama. That's not necessary a bad thing except the main characters aren't actors, they're action stars. Needless to say I was very disappointed. I wouldn't buy the dvd and wouldn't have seen the movie if I knew how bad it was. The only redeeming fact is that the script is surprisingly well written for what was suppose to be an action flick. The plot twist at the end actually surprised me, when most don't."
3,This is not a martial arts movie.,This film is not a martial arts movie. I give it between 3.5 to 4 stars because of the plot and the very good acting of Jet Li and Jason Statham. People think that Jet Li only makes martial arts movie. This is totally wrong. This is an action packed mafia movie between the Triads and the Yakuza. I would say this movie is alright to own in your library.
5,THIS STORY IS THE BEST!!!!,"After reading most of the Nightmare Hall books, this one has always been my favorite. It has a great plot and I was very surprised by the ending. 2 thumbs up! Good reads!"
3,A good value,"I bought these as a Christmas present for my husband. They fit well in his car and look very nice. However the material is thin and makes me worried it will wear out quickly. But for the price I paid I cannot complain, they were a good value for the total cost."
4,"""Paris Black"" (1990)",Tracks:1. Conspiracy2. Heaven Sent3. My Heart Is Still Young4. Letting Go5. Barely In Love6. Danced In My Direction7. I Don't Wanna Be Your Friend8. Bang Bang9. Don't say Goodnight10. If I Could Dance With You11. Every Emotion
3,Brief topless dancing,"Not a lot of nudity. Some sexy outfits and some topless dancing. Not as much as the title implies... Oh yeah, its black and white also."
5,Excellent playing,"In response to the last reviewer's concerns about the piano's sound in this recording, the dry, sharp sound has always been Gould's intention--it's as present in all of his recordings as is his singing. ""An x-ray of the music,"" was how he put it, and in order to achieve that trademark clarity, Gould miced his piano very closely, hence the lack of the usual ""resonance and depth"" we're used to from many other piano recordings. In my opinion, closely miced Bach is the best way to record it, since a great level of transparency is achieved--ideal for appreciating the music's tonic progressions and letting each note be heard. In many ways Gould was achieving a more harpsichord-like sound (remember the harpsipiano?) with his recording techniques. All in all, this recording, along with Vol. 2, presents Gould in his consistant excellence. Can't tell at all that he didn't care much for the Toccatas!"
3,"The ""Live"" element is in dispute","Whilst I love the music and this reformated band produce good stuff I chose the album because it was supposed to be live. Aside from a little muted clapping and cheering after some, but not most, tracks and the rare comment to the audience this album sounds like a well-produced studio album. In fact, I suspect foul play.""Original Masters"" (not live) remains the best overall album of this great band."
3,"Weak Compared To ""Don't Back Down""...","Guitar, guitar, guitar.... Where is the killer guitar? Yeah the Ramones didn't have solos, but they were the RAMONES!!! This album just continues the slide downhill from their two best albums ""Move Back Home"" & ""Don't Back Down"". Guess these guys can only rock if the word ""Back"" is in the album title. Start with those two albums and work your way back in time, not forward."
5,"Awesome band, awesome CD",We really like Relient K and were looking for similar types of music. Found it! We love this CD. It plays frequently at our house.
3,"Nice, big, but not flexible","I bought this particular ice cube tray from another site, same one , and cost me twice as much, however , I too have to give it a low rating because mine is already broken as well. This is very frustrating!!"
2,I really *tried* to enjoy this book -- honest.,"I've always heard good things about Sheffield's hard-science novels, and I've tried several of them, . . . but, somehow, I just can't get interested in them. The author's style simply leaves me cold. This one appears to be about finding a way to expand into the far corners of our galaxy without violating the limitation imposed by the speed of light. But I'm not sure about that, really, because I only got about 40% of the way in and then gave up because so little was happening. I was also put off by the author's apparent belief that nearly 30,000 years in the future, so little will have changed where people are concerned, both socially and culturally. Even given names are pretty much what you would find in a present-day phone book. Sheffield's science may be reliable but his imagination leaves a good deal to be desired."
3,Investigate deeper....and laugh!,"""Time to investigate deeper"", is one of the wackiest quotes in this want to be soft core porn the Naked Detective.Having the opportunity to see this first on HBO, I can't still stop laughing at the movie that shows us viewers a detective that is pulled into a mansion to investigate mysterious murders. Of course there is money involved, and what else but sexy women. Yet you cant turn the tv off once you start watching it. It's that fun.What seems to be is that the makers aimed to make this a soft core porn, but you watch the movie laughing at the bad actors and the simple plot. This is a movie for you and your drinking buds or when your feeling down, and you need a good laugh!"
4,trim installers kit,"Great little tool, using it all the time for my home projects.The bit (base) height adjustment is little rough, I wish Bosch used a fine thread for the clamp knob or refine this feature little"
1,Warning,This Deluxe kit comes with a good trimmer motor and accessories package but the trimmer guide that attaches to the accessorie plates is made out of plastic and is unusable to make a confident cut. Until Bosch creates a suitable metal guide system like they use to have on their old models and which you can find in competative models don't buy this kit.

4,Euphoribum is Sinusin,"My mother has adverse reactions to most medications. Having chronic sinus swelling, her choices have been limited. Euphorbium has worked well for her over the years. This new batch we ordered had a name change. Their phone number was incorrect. I emailed the company and this was their reply:""Thank you for you inquiry. About a year ago we decided to change the name of Euphorbium to Sinusin due to trademark issues. The formula is exactly the same...it is definitely not watered down or changed in any way. As for the 800 number, the company that prints are boxes made an unfortunate error and printed the incorrect number. We no longer work with that company!""""If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us at 1-800-621-7644."""
5,Excellent,My doctor recommended that I get this. He defers to a homeopathic remedy when available and effective. My friend also used this and it helped her also.
5,I love the ingredients.,"This has what I call the 3 pungent herbs. It has cayenne pepper, ginger and garlic. Trying to eat any of these raw is an extreme challenge. It also has the single best herb for the heart that is hawthorn berry. Although some may say that the cayenne pepper is the best for heart health. But this has that also (see above). The ginkgo biloba in it helps with circulation in the brain. The butcher's broom works very well in circulation in the legs. The bilberry in it can help with circulation in the eyes helping to nourish vision processes. I have been using this product for years and that means that it is doing its main job and that is to keep you alive."
5,My Favorite African Album,"I instantly fell in love with this album when I first heard it. It's innovative music that draws from deep African roots music and a fresh variety of World sounds--even bagpipes--for a contemporary pop fusion that is scrumptious and memorable. I have a love affair with African music, and this album is at the top of my very long list."
5,Need another CD Player,"This is a very good artistic work. I must have looked in 10 music stores for this on CD-ROM before I got lucky and found one. Although I listen to all types of music, I cannot seem to get this one out of my CD player as I want to hear this again before playing something else. This is one of those works that you can go back to over and over again without getting tired of it. I've written alot of good software while listening to Wasis Diop."
5,"a little girls love, pride and joy!","The shipment came whithin a few days. And boy when that huge box came I had a 7-year-old who thought Christmas had come early. This dolphin is huge. It is as long as my daughter and just as cute! It is soft and so far has stood up to going camping both in a tent and to a week of Bible camp. It is dragged to Grandma's house, to dad's house and always has the bed at mom's house. All in all a wonderful toy and an absolutely excellent price. Thank you."
5,plush dolphin review,Very realistic product! My daughter received this item for Christmas and it is her favorite gift! Love it!
5,FLIPPERS FOR LIFE <3,"so like I am OBSESSED with dolphins and I like them better than humans (often go to beaches supplied with scuba gear to befriend them)....ANYWAYS, flippers (the name of my stuffed dolphin) has basically changed my life. I love how when i sleep he never blinks and always keeps an eye out for me and my other (dolphin) stuffed animals. He is the perfect spooning size for all you SINGLE LADDIES (just saying). i suggest him to all dolphin lovers....hollah if you hear me."
5,Very Detailed and High Quality Plush Dolfphin,"I love Melissa and Doug plush toys. They are so realistic and i love them and they ship fast. Dolphin is grey, mouth is pink, only going on this far because wants twenty words or more, geez"
2,dolphin,I bought a stuffed dolphin earlier and the one which I ordered for the second time was much smaller than the previous one. I felt cheated.
1,wasnt great buy,"there were worn spots at different areas on the dolphin, already ripped 3 days after xmas gift.Was not happy with the purchase"
4,Cute stuffed animal - something good other than a bear for older girl,"My 10 year old daughter really likes this dolphin. It is large, but not huge. She wanted something other than the standard bears, etc but still wanted a large stuffed animal. She is more curious about dolphins now so is more interested in reading about them and learning about them."
4,Big hit! (But he can't breathe!),"My little girl loves her dolphin. It's very soft, and big, and the eyes are very nice. However, it's missing a very important dolphin feature: a blowhole! There is nothing along the top seam indicating where the blowhole should be, and she noticed right away. By no means a deal breaker, but missed nonetheless, especially when such care was taken on the eyes. xo Mrs. Land"
4,Who doesn't love a dolphin.,My daughter in law is into Dolphins' and the worst way. She loves this thing a keeps it on her bed. If you're into marine mammals this is a great thing.
5,Great Gift,I purchased this for my son's 3rd birthday. He is totally obsessed with all things dolphin. He reaction to this amazing stuffed animal was priceless. It is very durable and spot cleans well which was an important factor for me.
2,Fix-it Utilities,"First off,the registry clean-up does NOT quite deliver what is expected from it.It classifies the problem registry entries with green,yellow,and red colors and prompts you to be cautious about deleting yellow and red ones, but actually providing no information or whatsoever on how to go about removing those entries.You basically end up leaving those problems untouched.Secondly, XP/2000 doesnot require registry defragmantation by default.So it renders that feature useless.Most importantly,I don't know if it was Fix-it Wizards or the pagefile defragmenter.I got my CPU locked up at 100% so I had to restore my computer to the earlier saved restore point.Considering I purchased the laptop pretty recently and it was supposed to be a top-notch one the problem I experienced was not pleasing at all."
5,"A good product, however.","Personally I'd go the extra few bucks and buy the upgraded product from this company, their Systemsuite 5.0It's easier than upgrading later."
2,Mixed Results,"This product suite has a number of software tools, some very good and at least one that is really bad. The Registry editor is supposed to be excellent. However, I purchased this Suite to try to 'clean' a virus infested PC. The Virus checker/remover is by a company called Trend Micro, and the version they include in this package is essentially useless. On running it, it provide a list of 19 viruses but was unable to eliminate any of them. I don't know why, as I was able to manually delete all but one in which access was denied by Windows. However, manual deletion of virus files must be accompanied by registry changes and I found little help for this at the Trend Micro site; most of the information seemed to be outdated or wrong for the viruses in question and some seemed to be misidentified. I later obtained a free product, Free-AV, that succeeded where this product failed utterly."
4,Very informative,This book will be a great help for beginners wishing to build their own XT. Although outdated an XT might be fun to assemble for people who know nothing about computers. A word of advice though! Don't spend any money on your XT! Try to get everything for free or for giveaway prices as XTs are hopelessly outdated and only suitable for experimentation. A lot of people have thrown away their XTs as nothing much can be done with them these days.
3,Not a necessary purchase.,"This thing might work for circles fine. However, although it has a dual purpose (circular and straight cuts) I would not recommend this for straight cuts."
3,"Decent Jig for Circles - Max 16""","The quality is not the best, but it does the job for circles up to 16"". Check with your jigsaw's manual for directions on how to use it. Basically, you have to drill a pilot hole and insert the peg that is connected to the guide.Like others, I wish this was made from all metal. I already broke one of the plastic pins that hold the peg."
4,cutting guide,Found it to work as advertized. I really have nothing to compare it too but Iam satisfied with it for now
2,The (...)thing is plastic!,"Not only is it plastic, it is engraved with metric units of measure. I realize Bosch is a european sounding name, but if they are selling product in the USA they could at least warn you that this is a metric tool. If I wanted to learn the metric system, I would have asked to be born in Germany. If you commonly use inches, you will not enjoy using this accessory. Don't get me wrong, I really like plastic for toys and tupperwear. I think for the money this guide should be of a substantial metal construction."
2,You need this for the clamp - generics don't fit Bosch!,"This product is short and pricey compared to the generic which included 4 blades to fit a variety of different brand jig saws. If you have a Bosch jig saw, buy it because it's likely the only guide you'll find that includes a clamp that works with your saw.The big box stores' generic guide does fit this saw, but the clamp (which the literature inside the box admits) is made for the Skil. (Brands other than Bosch and Skil supposedly have a clamp built into the foot of the saw itself.) You need the clamp to hold the guide in place. Otherwise, the guide is worthless. So, unfortunately, if you have a Bosch jig saw, you need the Bosch guide even though it's 50% more expensive than the generic, even on Amazon."
2,This was made by Bosch?,"It's not really all that bad -- as far as it goes -- a piece of plastic with a metal rod that will let you cut along a reasonably parallel edge -- and if I had paid a few dollars for it at a discount store I'd say that's fine. But it's got Bosch's name on it and cost more than a few dollars. Very unclear instructions written on the packaging cardboard. All in all, a disappointemnt. I really should've heeded the other reviewers -- when half the reviews are three stars or less that's usually not a good sign. Doh!!The description also doesn't specify the maximum width of the cut -- I was looking for something around a 1 foot offset -- only works to about 8 inches."
3,Different origins,"After reading these reviews, it seems as if these are made from different sources and if you are lucky you will get a better made one. Good luck hope you get the better made one"
1,Just plain JUNK,"While my Bosch 1587 is quality made and the Bosch saw blades are the best I have used, the optional JA1003 Cutting Guide is a [X] piece of junk. As soon as I got it I pulled the set point out of its holder and one of the cheap plastic lock pins broke. I could make one better than this one. Also its made in China not the US or Germany! Also the instructions are printed in pictures on the cardboard package. There are no written instructions to give the novice usefull hints. If I only paid [X] for it I would say I got what I paid for. My advice is to look for a quality after market cutting guide and stay away from the Bosch."
1,save your money,"I agree with druziligaamazala The (...)thing is plastic!, and is worth about $2.00 and made in china !!!If this were way all BOSCH tools were made I would not have any .... save your money for a good aftermarket version"
2,An Embarrassment to Bosch,"I did get this thing to work, but barely.1) The centering pin is too short, so that only the tip reaches the workpiece. This means that if you drill the recommended size pilot hole, you get a very sloppy fit. Even with a smaller hole, you have to hold down the point quite firmly, bending the metal arm. I'll be using a 3/32 or smaller hole, rather than the recommended 13/64.2) The scale doesn't make sense. Cutting a 140mm hole, the 170mm mark was centered on the blade. The 140mm mark wasn't aligned with anything in particular.3) It just doesn't have the solid quality of the Bosch power tools I have bought recently.Tip: Cut very slowly, and you can get a good circle. The manual mentions cutting slowly, but the required speed is slower than I would have guessed. It works fine once you find the right pace, but practice on a scrap!"
3,Typical Made In China Quality (or lack thereof),"Not the worst item on the market but far from the best. Can do the job with care, patience and and an even temper. Basically, a mediocre accessory as is the norm for a Chinese product, in my experience. Expected better from Bosch but apparently quality is no longer a priority with them."
3,Not quite what I thought it would be,"I adored this swing when I saw it at the store, and when some thoughtful friends gave it to me when I was pregnant with my second daughter, I was delighted. However, as cute is it may be, it has its negatives. First off, it is not appropriate for a newborn. It doesn't recline nearly enough, and I had to drag out our big Graco swing from our first daughter. Second, as some one else mentioned, it doesn't stay folded. It's a bit irritating when you're hauling it from house to car to house, etc... Finally, the handle gets in the way when you are attempting to remove your child from the swing.The lights are cute and the music is cute, but personally, I'm glad I didn't pay for it."
2,Very cumbersome to place baby into,"Baby enjoys this once he is in it, but it is very hard for Mom to get the baby into the swing without hurting her back. I find this deters me from using it as much as I might otherwise. Also, I agree with another user that there should be an option to use the lights without the music. Also, mine did not have a slow speed, the lowest speed seems to go quite fast - perhaps a malfunction in this particular unit."
5,This product is an absolute must!,"This was one of my favorite items that I recommend for everyone. It is so portable and doesn't take a lot of space. We brought it with us on road trips all the time. In the beginning months when our baby was a little fussy, he would just sleep to his hearts content in the swing. And now that his is older, he loves to grab on to the fish and watch the lights. It's great!"
3,"Perfect, if you put it together right!!","We bought this swing because we got half way up north to go on vacation for a long weekend and realized that we forgot the big swing.I got this one because I had heard alot about it, but when my husband put it together the bar that attaches the back of the swing went on backwards, well the first time I put him in it he fell over and wacked his head between the two bars! I was Horrified!!I just got this swing on 8/19/04 so it should be the newer model...well you can still put that bar on backwards!If you install the bar correctly the swing is perfect, he cant lean over and hit his head on the bars anymore and it reclines enough so that he looks up at the lights without having to turn half way around in the darn thing.This could be simply avoided if they were more clear in the directions about how it goes on!!"
3,Good but not great,"I like the toy for my baby. She likes the green fish but not the orange one so much. I does move a bit fast even on the lowest speed but now that she is a bit older(2 months) she finds it more soothing. I find the fish on the sides to be useless she pays no attention to them. I do on the other hand love the music, it is very soothing and there is a nice assortment of music . It works well for me because I am in a small apartment and hate clutter so I can easily fold it up and put it under the crib. It is great for what I wanted it for. Oh it has very nice colors too..."
3,Cute design but needs work....not for young infants!,"This swing is very cute,looks adorable but is not suitable for a newborn or young baby untill at least 4mths of age...the reason it does NOT provide enough head support for young babies! My son got extremly uncomfortable and started crying as soon as i put him in this swing.although he loves his full size aquarium swing. The seat is too upright and most of the time his chin seemed to be resting on his chest! Also the hanging toys tend to hit him in the face when moving .Getting him out of the swing is hard without hitting his head in the overhead bar!i don't know why Fisher price can't make a good travel swing that will recline for a baby I have tried the linkadoos one as well and that turned out to be a bigger disappointment.Cute but needs work....."
2,Disappointed in product,"I bought this for our 3 month old daughter because she likes to be in a swing, but the full size one is too big to take room to room. The swing is great for its mobility except for a few things. First the music does not play very long at all and you have to constantly be resetting it. Also, the handle bar is in the way when you are trying to pull your wiggling infant out you have to make sure you don't hit their head on it. They should make the top open or make it an option to fold the handle down when you take your baby out. Also, if you need to change the batteries, you better make sure you have a phillips screwdriver with you, that is the only way to open & close the battery cover. Lastly, when you fold it up, it does not stay closed, you have to hold it all together. Other than that, I do like the variable speeds, the lights (when they stay on) and the toys that hang down."
1,SHOULD BE RECALLED,This swing is dangerous. My 3 1/2 month old son got his head/neck caught between the metal and plastic pieces on the side of the swing while it was moving. Don't waste your money on this swing.
5,Key element on swing-Seat Back Tube installed incorrectly.,We use to not like this portable swing because my 2 mos. old son wasnt able to see the lights directly. He was actually underneath the lights. His head would also fall to one side of the swing.He hated this swing. Now...however....we have since learned that one key part to the swing was put on incorrectly. The seat back tube needs to be put on the swing with the curved part angling towards the floor. The instructions were a bit confusing. So if your baby is sitting too upright in this swing; you have the seat back tube installed incorrectly. The dislay at the store was actually installed incorrectly as well so its an easy mistake.
1,recall,"my mother bought this for my son when he was first born about 7 mos. again. he loved it, but today my husband and i were walking through target and i noticed that there was a recall sign in front of it. apparantly the top bar isn't very secure and can fall down and hit your child in the head and the lap belt isn't very secure either. your child can lean forward and fall out of the seat causing further injury. i haven't been to the website yet to see what else it says about it but it should be on the fisher-price website."
1,Not trusting of this product,"I have tried this swing with my son since he was born. At first I thought he was too young to use it, so I tried him in it every month. The same thing happened repeatedly. He kept falling over to the side and his head would hit the blue bar while the swing was in motion. (the belt was appropriately fitted) Fortunately, we were there to get him out of it as soon as it happened.It seems that the seat sits too upright letting him fall over. I even tried holding him up with rolled up hand towels to the side of him, but that didn't work. Not to mention that the dangling objects also hit him in the head. The last time we tried the swing we taped those to the side, but once again he fell over hitting his head.I will not put my son in this swing again, ever let anyone borrow it, and never donate it to any organization."
2,I Wish We Would Have Gotten A Regular Swing Instead,"DS doesn't seem to like it too much, yet he loves the regular swing at day care. I think it's because of the shape of the seat. It's more like a boucey chair and I think he doesn't feel safe in it. Also, the low speed isn't much different then the high speed. It's way to fast. He also doesn't care for the lights. About the only thing he does like about it is the toys, fish, and music. At most, he'll only stay in it for about 20 minutes."
1,"do not buy, dangerous!!","I just returned this swing because it is not suitable for a newborn. When I put my son in it, he immediately fell to the side and almost had his head caught in between the bar and seat. It does not recline and has no head support whatsoever. And by the time he is able to hold his head up on his own, he would have outgrown the swing.....It is a very dangerous product, do not buy it!!!!"
1,horrible,"If I could give this zero stars I would.It is too hard to get baby in and out of without whacking their head. The music is obnoxious. And worst, if baby tips to the side, they can get their head caught between the swing bar and the handle. My child wasn't in this long enough for this to happen, but I can easily see how it could, and other reviewers have seen it happen. No recline options either. I wish I had read reviews before I bought this. It went right back to the store but since I bought it at full price and it was on sale, I only got the sale price back. :("
1,DANGEROUS SWING - DO NOT PURCHASE!,"This swing was a gift and we thought it really looked nice and very portable - until we started using it. I only used mine twice maybe and I stopped when my son's head almost got pinned between the metal bar and the plastic bar (where the fish in) while it was swinging. The harness belt is not enough to hold the baby. Maybe if they use a 5-point harness, it will hold my baby better and will not slide off to the sides while it was swinging. Another thing, when it swings, the hanging fishies hits his face everytime. I called Fisher-Price and they're taking the swing back. Yesterday, I received a letter from Fisher-Price apologizing for our unpleasant experience with their product and gave me a refund and a prepaid label to return the item to them. Fisher-Price did their part well so 5 stars to them but 1 star to the product. It needs redesigning. Better harness would correct it and eliminate the hanging fishies."
5,This swing is WONDERFUL!!!!!!,"This swing is wonderful! It does the job of a big clunky swing and the bouncer combined. With my first daughter I used the big Swing and the bouncer. My mom bought this for my 2nd daughter and it has been a life saver. The swing speed is very gentle but goes up to 8 speeds so it can handle her weight when she gets bigger.It's totally portable, you can even take the baby from room to room while she is in the swing. It breaks down beautifully for trips to the grandparents or visiting friends. My daughter loves the sweet music and pretty lights too.My only regret is that I wished I had, had this with my first daughter too :)"
2,not good for newborns,i got four swings as gifts for my baby and i returned all but kept this one because i thought it was the cutest. big mistake. i dont like to put my baby in it and he doesnt like it either. he is 2 months old now and still too small for it (he's 11lbs). it does not have good support for the back and he just looks looks so curled up in it.
3,Its Alright,I bought this for my almost 2month year old daughter and she really loves the lights. The first thing wrong with it is the hanging thing on the side. When she trys to sleep and moves her arms she wakes up from hitting the toys hanging. Also I wish the seat could recline so my baby isnt sitting way up.
2,Not for young babies,"My baby's head falls to the side in this swing! It does NOT recline enough. This is for babies who have full head support and can sit up on their own. Not, NOT for newborns!!! Needs to be re-called. If you are going to use this swing, make sure you are within eye sight of your baby, don't take any chances and leave baby for any length of time because his/her head can get caught in the side, even with the net there."
1,Another dissapointed customer,"The full size version of this swing is amazing and wonderful and I would recommend it without reservation. This smaller version however was horrible. Take the safety advice of the manufacturer to heart; if the baby is mobile it's going to hurt itself. In addition to the often mentioned toys hitting the head, my daughter, who is quite squirmy managed to hit her head with the support bars. I could envision her getting her head caught in between them. We've had this since my daughter was born seven months ago. And have used it periodically hoping that she would grow in to it. She never did and after the support bar incident she will never get in to it again. After the phenomenal success with the larger swing I was more than disappointed by this one. My Wife is in the process of asking Fischer Price directly for a refund."
2,too much going on,"My son loves to stare at the orange fish and the lights and the music... but gets over stimulated and gets upset. The batteries don't seem to last that long. Its portable but still bulky, not likely we'll take it too far. Hard to get the baby out without hitting his head on the light bar. I wish I had just gotten an open top full sized swing instead of this."
3,Definately NOT for newborns,"I received this as a gift and was so excited because of the portability. I love that it is so portable and hardly takes up any space at all, unlike the big and bulky swing we had for our first born. I also like that the music is soothing to me as well as the baby and not the same old Rock A Bye baby stuff, so it's not annoying. However, there are also several things I hate. First of all, it sits too upright and I was unable to put my baby in it until he was nearly 4 months old, even though it says it's perfect for newborns. He hated it and was extremely uncomfortable, he preferred his bouncer seat instead. I can put him in it now, but not for long. He usually falls asleep, which is a nice break for me, but not for long because he gets uncomfortable. All in all it's okay, I haven't had any major problems or defects but I wouldn't recommend it for a newborn by any means. It would be the perfect product if the seat reclined a bit more."
1,"DANGEROUS, purchase with caution","We bought the Graco Swingomatic fold up swing (Jackpot print)after returning the Ocean Wonders Take along swing. Please read the reviews. Many babies have been injured in Fisher price travel swings - their heads get caught between the swing and the support bars. Graco redesigned their swing and put in a 5 point harness A MUST, and some come with a baby head support- reccomended for young infants. Graco travel swings have mesh on the sides to prevent such injuries. ***(Fisher Price- please follow suit- Ocean Wonder is a wonderful line but NOT the Take along swing)*** You can see my review under the Graco swing."
5,Essential,"I tried this swing at a friend's house and my baby loved it. I rushed out and bought one. It is the only thing that keeps baby happy enough for me to get some things done, including taking a shower (LOL). Some people have complained that the seat is too upright -- I suspect they did not put the back bar on facing the correct direction. If you assemble it following the directions, there should be no problem."
1,"Waste of money, disappointing","Newborn cannot be placed in the seat, it will not recline enough for him to lay down and it is slouched just so that it's even hard to prop the baby up with blankets and such. By the time baby is old enough to sit up in this thing his feet will hang off. Also when you do try to rig it so baby can be propped in it, it's still horrible because the hanging sea animals hit him in the head!"
4,"Great, but swinging speed is way too fast",Love the product but the swing is very FAST! With the swing on the lowest setting (1) I couldnt believe how fast it was going. I couldnt imagine using this thing full blast. My kid would be thrown across the room.Other than that the swing is great.
3,Good Swing,"My newborn son loves this swing for about 15 minutes per day. Plus he falls asleep when it's on the #2 setting and with or without the music playing for about 2 hours. It's been great for me so I can do other things at the same time. If you use rechargeable batteries for the swing and other toys, you will get the best use out of it. For us it has lasted at least a week using rechargeable batteries. The only thing wrong with the music is that sometimes you have to switch between the 3 settings to get it going. I do wish that there was a way for the baby to re-activate it himself as well."
1,a disappointment...,"The idea of taking a swing with you is a nice thought, but this sure does need some improvements.This swing worked only marginally well until my son weighed about 15 pounds. After that, his weight seemed to be too much for the swing to handle. No matter which speed we set it on, each yielded the same results (""7"" worked the same as ""4"")The seat is very wide, and in my opinion, there is not much lateral support. Even though he was properly strapped in, I noticed that my son would start to lean to the side while in this swing. He even leaned so much that I worried his head would get wedged between the bars of the swing and the stand. It wasn't worth the risk to me.I was disappointed with this product and my son did not enjoy it."
2,Not useful for younger babies that can't support their head.,"Very cute swing and a great idea, however my daughter who is 3 months old keeps falling over and she was caught between the bar and swing. I think that it will be better when she's older.Also, the only other drawback is that it sits up pretty straight. It's not like larger swings. So just be cautious with younger babies."
1,NOT A SNUG FIT FOR A NEW BORN,This swing does not secure baby very well. I was constantly lifting my son up because he slumped down or over to the left or right. Once he slumped all the way over to where his head was almost next to the fish on the side of the swing.NOT A VERY SAFE SWING FOR A NEWBORN or any baby that can't support their own head or sit up on their own.....
1,Not for all babies,"My son hates this swing. He never liked it. As mentioned from quite a few other people, it is very difficult to remove a baby w/o hitting their head.My son tore a neck muscle when he was delivered and b/c of that he ""tips"" to one side, and the toys were always hitting him in the head. It was awful.The swing does move quite quickly, also. Setting #2 was all I could use for a long time b/c it moved so fast.It may fit some babies, but definatley not mine!"
3,Disappointed with product,"I wanted this swing since it allows for newborns and is portable. Like the other reviewers, I noticed that you have to be very careful removing your child from the swing so as not to hit his head on the handle. My son is 1 month old and just noticing the toys on the sides, but the lights and music seem to be too much stimulation at once. I also noticed that the swing moves quite quickly for small babies; we haven't ever set it above ""2"". Overall, it was not a good value for the price."
3,Just another OK item,"We don't have the aquarium model for our daughter, we have a different motif. It only has one music setting and six swing speeds. It came w/a butterfly attached to the straps, instead of a fish. She liked it well enough when she was small, liked watching the lights and just like any other swing, it put her to sleep. It's good enough when the baby is small to travel with, short day trips where you dont want to drag the playpen. The way around the head bobble when the baby is small is to use one of the head holders, like you might get for the carseat when they're small (dont remember the actual name). A good enough investment if your family takes the baby for a day and needs something small for a distraction."
1,PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING PLEASE,"Like others on this board, my baby almost DIED using this product. Please beware. I used this swing and LOVED it for weeks and weeks before anyting happened. In fact, I would have recommended it to anyone until this hahppened. I was using it properly, strappingmy baby in properly and oen day, while doing chores I heard her screaming and went in and found her choking, as she had fallen over one edge and her head was stuck b/n the mesh netting and metal bar. I AM NOT KIDDING in that she would have choked to death had i not attende to her quickly. HEED THE WARNINGS of the other reviews of this item. I talked to the manufactur and I am convinced this product will be recalled."
5,Love this swing,"I love this swing! It is so nice that it is portable and you can move from room to room with ease. Also, it is so convienent that I take it everywhere including camping!<br /><br />"
5,VERY PLEASED,"I BOUGHT THIS SWING FOR OUR DAUGHTER WHEN SHE WAS A FEW WEEKS OLD SHE LOVED IT FROM THE START SHE SLEEPS IN IT ALL THE TIME SHE LOVES THE LIGHTS AND THE MUSIC, INFACT SHE LOVES IT SO MUCH I PUT THE SWING NEXT TO HER CRIB SO SHE CAN HERE THE MUSIC WHILE SHE GOES TO SLEEP, IT INSTANTLY PUTS HER OUT. I READ THE REVIEW ABOUT BABY HAVING HAD THEIR HEAD STUCK I LOOKED AT THE SWING AND CANT SEE HOW IT HAPPEND, SHE SITS IN IT AND HER HEAD GOS TO THE SIDE BUT THERE SEEMS NO WAY FOR HER HEAD TO GET EVEN A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TO GETTING STUCK, THAT BABY MUST HAVE BEEN TO BIG OR TO OLD TO EVEN BE IN THE SWING, IT IS VERY STURDY, AND RECLINES PLENTY THE MUSIC IS A PERFECT LOUDNES AND AS FAR AS HITTING THEIR HEAD WHILE GETTING HER OUT YOU JUST NEED TO GENTLY LIFT THEM OUT I HAVE NEVER HIT HER HEAD ON IT YET, I THINK THIS SWING IS WORTH THE MONEY ITS A GREAT SWING...EMMAS MOM.."
1,Disappointing...,"I thought I was going to love this swing because I have the larger version of this one and the bouncer, but to my disappointment, the moment I put my baby in it, he got very upset. I thought he was just being colicky or fussy, but EVERY single time I put him in it, he would react the same way. He loves his Ocean Wonders cradle swing and bouncer, but somehow, he just didn't like this model. I figured it was the lights above, it seemed a little overwhelming. The toys kept hitting him in the head as it swung and worst of all, it was VERY HARD to store! Every time I folded it and set it aside somewhere, it would just open up again and collapse. I returned mine and bought the Linkadoos travel swing, we'll see how well that goes."
4,Great for traveling,"We bought this swing when my baby was about 4 months old to go back and forth with us when we would visit friends and family. She absolutely loved it and the only reason we stopped using it was because she outgrew it. (She is 1 year now). The little pull toys make it easy for the baby to turn it on and off themselves and kept my daughter very entertained. The bar over the head was a little tricky at first, so I understand that and that is why I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars. But otherwise, it is easy to take with you, compact and wonderful. Great purchase!!"
1,READ THIS!!! Please let www.cpsc.gov know!,"It is the website for the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. They handle recalls and have a complaint report area. I had registered for this swing as well as the Linkadoos one and have taken them both off due to the bad reviews. If I were one of the customers who had a bad experience, I would contact Fisher-Price as well as this agency. Let's get these things off the market! The Graco Travel Lite swing has already been recalled so please also report anyone still selling it, as I have seen on several websites."
4,Good Swing with Great Portability,"We have been using this swing almost 2 weeks with our newborn. However, we added a Snuzzler to the seat for more support because it is made for older babies. Our baby loves the swinging motion. I love the portability of the swing. I have been taking it from the family room to the bath room which allows me valuable shower time without worrying. We originally were thinking about purchasing the larger swing, but I am glad that we decided on this swing because of the portability and size. I highly recommend this swing."
1,YUCK,"This is an excellent example of a horrible design. It is supposed to be suitable for newborns, but our 2 1/2 month old has yet to fit in it properly. Moreover, the upright seat angle makes her head slouch forward or to the side at dangerous angles and seem to compromise her breathing, at which point the hanging fish continually bang her head as it swings. It's real cute, but leave this thing behind."
1,I hated this swing!,I thought havng this swing would be wonderful because i can move it easly from room to rom and take it along with we when i go places. One my daughter (at3 months) would fall to the side of it and one time fell out of it. it dones not recline enough for a younger infant. the toys hit her on the head. the batteries are to hard to put in. it was a pain to put together. i but mostly fisher price items and this one is the worst item I have ever purchased from them!
2,Not for little babies!,I tried this swing out with my 3 week old son and it has absolutely no support for little babies. It only has a waist strap so little babies fall foward and hunch over. However my friend who has a 7 month old daughter tested it out yesterday and her daughter loved it! She loved the lights and she didn't hunch over at all.
1,No support for baby,"I own the larger version and my daughter has loved it since day one. I purchased this swing with travel in mind. I agree with many of the other reviews. The big problems: the handlebar over the seat makes it difficult to get baby in and out without hitting her head and the seat is at a 90 degree angle which causes my 4 month old to slide off to the sides. My daughter has not had her head caught between the side and the back while swinging yet, but I can see how it would happen. Also, since she's always slumping in it the dangling fish on the sides hit her in the head/face while she's swinging. I took twist-ties and secured the fish to the side rail to prevent this and she can still pull them.Don't waste your money on this."
1,dangerous and ridiculous,"We recieved this as a gift at a baby shower and I was tempted to take it back. I really should've followed my instinct.My 3.5 month old is not supported in this, and when I attempt to prop him with a blanket, the animals hit him in the head. To make matters worse, his head got caught between the white bar and the aquamarine bar and he was being hit in the head. This could lead to serious injury that I don't believe fisher price considered upon making this product.Save your money and go buy something else. It's not worth the risk of your baby being hurt"
3,cute but a little annoying for baby,"This swing is very cute, plays nice soothing music and is a good small size. My complaint about this swing is that the fish toys that hang down from the top carrying bar get in his way and rub against his face when he is in the swing. I wish there was a way that they could detatch or at least wind up out of the way of my baby. When you use the swing to calm a fussy baby and you have these toys hitting him, it makes matters worse and he's fussier than he was to begin with!"
3,So-so swing,The main complaint is that it sits up to high and my twins(one in it at a time) end up leaning over to the side. Other than that I really like it. They really like the lights and enjoy the music.
1,Hated It!!,"I bought this swing because it was moblie and did not take up as much room as the larger, full sized swings. The first time I put my son in the swing, he hit his head on the metal bars - I thought maybe he was too young for the swing. I have been trying to use the swing for 6 months now, and everytime I put him in it his head is hit by the bars. There was even a few times when his neck was stuck in between the swing and the metal bar. If you ask me, this swing is poorly designed and a hazard to the babies who use it."
2,Cute but not practical,"I already had a full size Graco Swing for my 2 month old but I needed a travel swing to take to Grandmas for frequent visiting. It worked well for the first two weeks and my baby really like the hanging toys but then the batteries died. After finally figuring out to replace them (takes a bit of a trick to get the battery compartment back in its slot)the Duracell batteries died again in another two weeks. Overall the swing is cute and my baby liked it for a while but he only used for 1 month tops and he much prefers the full size swing. Not really worth the extra expense, stick with the full size or another travel model."
1,The Worst of Both Worlds,"This swing is not good as a travel swing nor as a regular swing. The seat doesn't support my baby at all (chronic slumping!) and it rocks much too slow, especially compared to a full-sized swing. My son is not soothed in it at all - it is just an expensive chair. It also doesn't travel very well and is difficult to carry with one hand. And the overhead bar makes lifting him out a very tricky maneuver. My son likes the lights/fish/music but we could have got those features on the bouncy chair for much cheaper. Don't waste your money on this one - either get a full size swing or one of the other travel swing models. I'm taking mine to a consignment shop today to hopefully get a least a few bucks back so I can purchase a useful swing."
5,Easy to move from room to room,Our baby loves this swing. He has enjoyed it since he was 1 month old. He still likes it at almost 4 months. It is gret to be able to carry it into different rooms depending on what I am doing. It also doesn't take up too much floor space.
2,Not very comfortable,"I liked the idea that the swing was compact and didn't take up so much room. However, the seat is at such a tough angle my baby has yet to be comfortable sitting in it. His head is put at position where he has to look straight out but head control is an issue. Plus the lights under the handle is such an attraction that he winds up slumped over to look at them and then the toys that hand down hit him in the head. I had to tie one up so he could lay sideways. We do much better w/bouncy seats and the old fashion big clunky swing."
5,The Best Swing Ever!,My 10 week old son Loves this swing and I couldn't survive without it. My son has had a few moments of leaning over but if you just put in a blanket or something to support their head you should have no problem. I love it because it fits nicely on the kitchen counter or table. When I am cooking or cleaning in the kitchen I can still have full contact with him and don't have to worry about him being in the other room. I also use it in the bathroom to take showers. He loves the lights and music. The battery problem is an easy fix just buy a set of rechargables and recharge them at night! It is a wonderful travel item also. I also got a bouncer at my shower and I have only used it twice because the swing is it!
2,cute but try new version,"i got this because i thought it was cute and loved the ocean wonders. it was really cute, but my baby's head would always look like it was going to fall forward. I bought the new version wiht the pivot 'n play handle (still ocean wonders) and it is much better. she is much more comfortable and the bar moves making it easier to take the baby out."
5,We Love this swing,"We bought this swing for it's portablity, and we love it. My daughter sits in it and watches the lights while I enjoy a relaxing bath. We take it to friends houses with us and she just loves it. She has been it for two months now and we have had no problems with her head fallong over or her being incomfortable. She absolutly loves it."
1,Not for newborns!,"When I originally bought this, I thought it was great! Music, lights, and a toy and swing combo with great colors. However, I soon found out that it is NOT SAFE for babies that cannot hold up their head! My 7 week old started leaning, and within 30 seconds was in a position where his head was between the frame and light stand over the net area of one side. Fortunately, it was only for a split second and he is o.k. This may be fine for older infants, but I would not take the chance! I brought this one back immediately!"
2,Not easy putting baby in and out of the swing,"I had purchased this swing a few months and I'm not ALL that pleased with it. It's great for traveling around with. But I felt that the bar that goes across and above the baby's head was in the way. Everytime I would put her in or put her out- that bar was right smack in the middle and the seat kept swinging forward. So you have to watch out for the overhead bar. Other than that, great for traveling and easy to store."
4,Love this toy,"I bought this toy for my newborn 2 1/2 months ago. He did not like the swing at first, but now that he is older he loves it. The lights memeroize him and he loves to pull on the toys eventhough he is only 11 weeks old. I do agree that it is hard to get the child out, but I think all swings are hard to get kids out of. I did have to use a car seat head rest with this toy when my son was smaller, but I sill have never had the toys hit him in the face. He also have never got his head stuck anywhere in this toy, and he is a big boy (13.8lbs) When I bought this swing I was worried about how stable it was going to be, and if the speeds were able to push larger baby (since I have already had a history of large babies) My worries were soon disolved. The eight different let you adjust to your baby's size and also my son likes it slower if he is sleeping. I would recommened this toy to anyone looking for a compact swing!!"
2,"Not easy to ""Take Along""","This swing does not stay folded up when you try to carry it somewhere. The seat unfolds and when you try to stand it somewhere (like putting it down when coming thru the door with an armload of stuff) it won't stay propped up against anything, it just falls on the floor. The toys hit the baby in the head and the bar is too low to try to get baby out without hitting head. I do not think this is a good swing to ""take along"". It is bulky. The lights do not stay on to keep baby entertained. Only good thing......it is very sturdy and does swing very well."
1,terrable,I bought this swing for my newborn. I tried to put her in it and the seat sat up so high that she fell over . We would out a blanket around her to prop her up but if she was anywhere but right in the middle the toys hanging down hit her in the face. I put it away for a couple of months and tried it again now that she is three months. the toys still hit her in the face and the seat is still up so high that she has to turn her head up tp even see the lights on the top. This toy was a TOTAL waste of money even for a part time wing.
4,Very fun for baby,"I put my new born baby in the sing and turn on the music and lights. He loves to just watch the lights go on and off. The only downfall to this swing is that my baby slumps down in the sing too much (the swing needs a support for newborns) and this causes the fish to hit him in the face when it's on. So, for right now I leave it off. Overall, it's a good swing."
4,Great swing,"This swing is a great buy and is easy to take along while travelling. The aquarium sounds did a great job of soothing my baby.For those who say this swing is dangerous, well, I never had that problem at all. As with all baby products, you really should keep an eye on your baby while he/she is in the swing. My daughter never slumped in it or hit her head. I would definitely buy this again!"
2,from NJ,"we got this as a gift when our daughter was 6 weeks old. It now sits in a corner, as it makes her cry more. The lights are too bright & make her squint. There's nothing for her to play with. She ignores the 2 ""swimming"" fish, and the haning plastic ones annoy her, as the swinging brings them too close to her face. And the music turns off automatically after a few minutes. She's much more content in her hard car seat! i gave it 2 stars, due to its size, and the fact that without lights & music on, we have gotten her to sleep in it on rare occasions."
4,pleased mom,"I got this for my baby because I am a single mom and I thought that the soothing music and the swinging motion would help her get to sleep or at least relax her during those times when I absolutly need some time just to breath. It works very well and I love the fact that it folds up, we can take it anywhere! I don't have a problem with the music going on as long (or short like some say) as it does because if it went on any longer the batteries would run out so quickly! I wish that there was an option for it to be plugged in. It would make a lot more sense that way for someone who intends to use this frequently!"
2,"Like F-P, but not this","My daughter loves her swing, so I wanted to try one that was portable. NO WAY! I tried a friend's swing and she hated it. She is use to a swing with a hard back and this one is softer than her bouncy seat. I'm glad I tried it before wasting my money."
2,NOT AS PLEASED AS I THOUGHT I'D BE,"I received this item as a gift at my shower. I loved the theme and bright colors. I liked the portability, but was not pleased when I put my 2mo. old in the swing. I did not like the fact that it cannot recline to suit a newborn. Also while my son is very active (even at a young age), he managed to slide sideways and got his head caught between the side bars. I was devasted to see my baby lying there with his head against the netting. Needless to say, he has not been in it since."
2,Well...,"You know, with a little more work, this could've been a pretty good thriller. Watch it and you'll see what I mean--all the pieces are there, they just don't get used quite right. It's like watching the rough draft of a better movie. Traci Lords, meanwhile--you get the sense she could carry her weight in a better movie. If you're a big fan of her recent career, go ahead and spring for this dvd."
4,No Traci nudity but mucho hot,"I really need lunch, so you can bet that writing this review is important to me if I am putting off lunch to do it. So here goes:This is an erotic thriller, so you would expect Traci to be naked. But you see, she won't do nude scenes now. At least that's what she says. Why? I guess she figures that we've seen enough of her, and if you want to see her nude you have to buy Traci I Love, and let me tell you, she's a hell of a lot more than just nude in that one.Not that there isn't plenty of nudity in Extramarital (there is), and not that Traci still isn't the sexiest woman in the world (she is). And she's sort of nude: no nipples, but plenty of ... panty and hands-on-breasts sort of shots.So if you are a Traci fan, go for it."
5,Thank God For Ralph!! One GREAT Book!!!!,"This new book on RL is AWESOME!!! From first page to last!! Easy reading text, clean, clear wonderful photos and behind the scenes glances. Can't say enough about all the pics!! Examples from Lauren's private life to his clothing ads to the stores. Everything Lauren fans will jump for joy over.The text is well written. Informative and clear..BUT..not in an obsessive ""he's the ONLY person in the world"" kind of way. I have been following Ralph since I first bought one of his shirts 23 years ago. The man is genius. This book gives a very nice look into the world of RL and RL himself.This is a PERFECT book for all the Ralphilites the world over. A great looking coffee table book well worth the reading. I have been following this book's on-again-off-again release for almost 2 years now...All I can say is it lives up to all the hype it has stirred up on both sides of the ocean.5 stars."
3,disappointing rendition of great music,"It seems obvious to me that this CD is a digital recording of someone's vinyl original, with pops and all. I think I would have ended up with less popping and extraneous noise if I had a digital copy of my own vinyl version of this great Renbourn effort. I am very disappointed in the quality of the recording, not in the music itself -- which is timeless and every bit as enjoyable as I remember it from when I played vinyl music. There is a more expensive European CD available. I would recommend you put out the extra money for it, provided you can verify that it is actually a digital remastering of the original tapes, and not just another digital sampling of someone's vinyl copy."
4,A super summer dinosaur read!,"I loved the whole story line and the characters involved. Just the idea of having a time-quilt effect bring the past(millions of years ago) exist with the present was interesting to see what consequences resulted. I loved the New York City portion of the story with the old lady and the Iguanadon, she just took the whole situation in stride with life. The author writes very descriptive of what the country looks like after the quilting happens, I was able to see the steamy jungle like swamp next to the towering New York apartments. I had a great time with this book."
3,Good book with some problems,"Unless a book is just seriously bad or encredibly long, I generally get it read in 8-24 hours. I finished this novel in about 18. James David's Footprints of Thunder has a great premise and some excellent storylines, but I must agree with some of the other reviewers - TOO MANY STORYLINES! As well, many of these storylines are completely ignored at the end of the novel and I was left wondering what happened. You don't have to agree with how a book ends, but you should at least get to KNOW how it ends.All in all, this author had some good ideas and kept my attention the whole way through. I think he just had too many things going on in the novel and couldn't spare the time to wrap them all up and leave us with a sense of satisfaction."
3,An Exciting Story!,"I liked the premise of this story very much. This book could have actually been expanded in several areas to make for a more rich reading experience. The motivations for some of the events seemed to have been forced, which could have been helped if more time had been spent in character development. Don't get me wrong. The action and suspense scenes were very well done, but would have been better if I had gotten to know more about the characters.The explanation of the cause of the quilt effect was interesting, but the resolution was not as satisfying as it could have been. No accountability for rash actions was forthcoming nor was there a satisfying end to the story, which was rather rushed. However, I do give it three stars based on the scenes where the dinosaurs intereacted with present day humans. I will read other works from this writer to see if the potential is fulfilled."
3,An average read,"I liked the beginning, was bored in the middle, really enjoyed the book as it neared the end, and was dissapointed with the ending.I was also very dissapinted to find out that the book did not come close to ""Lucifer's Hammer"" (one of my favorite books) or ""Jurassic Park."" This book is good enough if you have nothing else better to read, but I wouldn't give it any awards. The plot had a chance to be very good, but the characters were thin and not very likeable. Anything involving Washington D.C. was boring. And the book ended with plenty of questions still remaining.I felt that there were way too many Dinosaur plots, when there could have been an interaction with Neanderthals or another interesting time period. Too many Dinos = overkill.Overall it was worth the price of a paperback."
2,"The Lost World, It Isn't","At 500+ pages, Footprints Of Thunder is not for those lookingfor a quick 'dino on the rampage' read. As the past is thrown intothe future and vice versa, this book follows the aftershocks of several groups of people dealing with dinosaurs grazing outside their windows (and sometimes reaching in to graze on them). While starting off promisingly enough, FOT loses its way about 200 pages in, and wanders aimlessly from subplot to suplot, while truly developing none of them. This is dissapointing, as the premise is truly original. Characters intended to be heroes are written in a way that makes the reader unsympathetic to their plight, while those most interesting are lost early on. While revolving plot lines are enough to keep ones interest through the bulk, a stunningly unsatisfying ending makes it all a waste of time."
2,Wanted this to be good..,"...but it simply wasn't. Not only did the author choose one of the least swallowable plots I've come across in the past many years, but he tried to present it in about 1/2 the number of pages it would have needed to be meaningful. Too many characters, too many shifts in perspective, too many sub-plots, and very little satisfyingly wrapped up. There were a few bright points - Granny and her pet dinosaur were cute and diverting, for instance, and some of the other characters were amusingly drawn - but these are not enough for me to recommend the book."
1,"Great premise, horrible finish","This book description on the cover had me really interested at first. I will give the author credit for writing great action sequences. The first part of when the world began to adjust to the ""change"" was really interesting and how the characters dealed with it seemed promising, but the whole thing eventually turned sour. Characters that at first seemed very real quickly turned flat b-movie caricatures the moment they were put into dangerous situations, their decisions completely unbelievable or the ultimate cliches. Even the dinosaurs turned out to be unbelievable because the author gave most of them human characteristics."
2,Not Quite Enough Teeth But Pretty Entertaining Nonetheless,"Dinosaurs are great literary tools when used to rouse wonder, speculation or even terror. But as this novel showed, if a solid plot is not present or if the narrator tries to appeal to every possible reader, dinosaurs alone cannot carry a story. Don't misunderstand: the storyteller here entertained and made me think. It's simply unfortunate that the novel, with all of its worthy parts, could not congeal into something transcending those individual pieces."
4,Excellent book!,"I picked this book up at a booksigning and didn't end up reading it for a few months. When I finally got around to reading it I couldn't put it down. It is a lot more then your normal predictable novel. I was kept guessing until the end. The book was well written and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense, mysteries, or science fiction. Better then Jurassic Park and WAY better then The Lost World. A great book and, hopefully, a great movie someday"
4,Brings unusual elements together in unexpected ways - great.,"An enjoyable book. The strange events (which the author reports are true) are fun and fascinating - gives it a kind of ""X-files"" ambience. The character of the old woman that the author mentions was particularly compelling. Because it is fanciful fiction it breaks the barriers that we often feel bound by. It brings together unusual elements in unexpected ways. An excellent first novel"
1,Thunders of Boredom,"I hate to do this, because I know the effort that takes to write a book, but this book was BAD. Great idea but horrible execution, there are tons of characters and several plots running in parallel, and suddenly the book ends leaving half of those plotlines unfinished.Don't waste your time."
1,Oh god I can't believe I own this movie!,"If you haven't seen a movie with Jennifer Jason Leigh, Ann Gillian, and Mako in it, this is your movie. Keep in mind that half of the dialogue is in Japanese but there are no subtitles. Also keep in mind that there's a near-rape scene and lots of toplessness. This is not Jennifer Jason Leigh's best movie. In fact I would bet that she would rather forget this film shot twenty years ago, as would most who worked on it. The best thing about it is its name. Oh, but there are no martial arts in the movie. Sorry."
3,The Reluctant Dragon,"The 1941 feature film was based around the writer, Robert Benchley, touring the Disney studios. This is why I was interested in purchasing this film. Unfortunately, the Disney ""Mini Classic"" release has been edited down to just the cartoon. Benchley is not to be seen or heard. For this reason I am disappointed in the release. If you have no interest in Robert Benchley, you will no doubt love this classic Disney ""mini"" feature (21 minutes long) and the accompnying short cartoon about a small moose. The transfer is well done and the sound is very good for the period."
1,CAUTION,"Buyers BEWARE: I just purchased this film and it is NOT the full Robert Benchley version as pictured (which I believe is very deceiving).This is nothing more than the animated segment (AKA: Reluctant Dragon), not to be mistaken with the full movie version, The Reluctant Dragon (as pictured), which was a mix of both live-action and animation.The only reason I ever enjoyed The Reluctant Dragon so much was for Benchley's magically funny tour of the original Walt Disney Studios in California where he goes to plug the idea to get the cartoon made. Not only was the Disney tour a learning experience, but Benchley overcomes several hilarious obsticles on his way to pitch his ideas to Walt. The film was golden.Unfortunately, this video is NOT it. It is just the animated dragon short followed by another animated short about a moose.So, if the animated feature is all you want to see--this is perfect for you."
4,Dating ideas & thoughts on relationships abound!,"I found this book to be refreshing and easy-to-read. To make a date successful, you have to get a little creative and spontaneous at times. An example given in the book: Have your own drive-in movie by putting a TV/VCR on your hood. Park in the driveway (or wherever),pop some popcorn and have a good time. Dave and Diane also interject some useful and hilarious information throughout. Check out the pick-up lines, especially! I'm going to keep this book on my living room table to pick up the next time I revert to my old, boring dating habits!"
4,Rockin' Sydney Lives Up To His Name!!,"Some purists might dismiss Rockin' Sydney. His was a Creole but he didn't speak French ( I don't think, although he occasionally sings in French) He used drum machines, a lot of it doesn't have rubboard and a lot of the songs are more pop than zydeco or blues. So what! He's great and his stuff goes way beyond My Toot Toot. Check out Harlem Shuffle. Pretty great. He does the waltzes and rockers and everything in between. The ultimate DIY man. Recorded in his garage and started his own entertainment park. He plays all the instruments himself on his first record. If you are a zydeco purist you might not get into it especially with all the drum machine but I think it only adds to the Rockin."
3,Good but could it be better?,I purchased this exact model 8 years ago and it just gave up and only puts out about 2kv. Time for a new one. Since it lasted 8 years I may have to buy it again but this will be the third time I have had to buy a zaper in 11 years. I guess I expect to much.
1,This book is not representative of the actual test,"I used the Microsoft A+ Certification Readiness Review as a supplemental study aide for my A+ exam. I passed the exam with flying colors but I attribute my success to the ""A+ Certification Exam Guide"" by Mike Myers.The questions in the Microsoft book are much more difficult than those on the actual exam. Many of the questions are lengthy scenarios that in no way mimic the actual exam. I would caution those who buy this book that your progress cannot be accurately gauged using the practice exams in this book. The actual exam simply is not this difficult. I would strongly suggest that you buy the Mike Myers book and read only the sections marked ""test specific"". Once you do this, you'll be more than ready for the exam. Don't waste your money, or more importantly your time using this book as a study aide."
2,"Good info, but insufficient for passing the exams","I just passed (January 2003) both A+ exams, using this book as one of my references. The book and CD did test you on the info in the MS A+ Certification Training Kit; however, the nature and scope of the sample test questions are different than the current A+ questions: some sample test questions ask you about arcane topics or are a dozen lines; none of the questions on my test neither covered any of the arcane topics in this book nor were longer than 2 or 3 lines. I would recommend using this book and the Microsoft A+ Certification Training Kit Review as supplements to one or more of the slim A+ Adaptive Exam books by either Meyers or Crayton. The practice tests on the included CD were good."
1,Don't buy.,"If you're looking for a book to prepare you for the A+ certification tests, DO NOT buy this book. This book was written for the 220-221 and 220-222 tests which are no longer available."
1,Too Mature a Book for an 8_year Old,"This book is much too mature (and boring for an 8-year old). The vocabulary is too advanced, and the story is uninteresting to someone that young. If you decide to purchase it, know that it's for an a younger teen."
4,A student's review of The Discovery,"The DiscoveryThe Discovery is an interesting, exciting book, because you never know what will happen next and there's always a new twist. There is so much excitement, you can't put it down. Although I enjoyed this book, I liked The Danger, the third book in the series by Gordon Korman, better because it had even more excitement and suspense than The Discovery. I would have liked The Discovery better if it had more action in it. This book and series are definitely worth reading."
4,Great Book,"This book is a little slow to start, but then, it is the first in a series, you need to get to know the characters.It starts with a group of four kids, all of which like to dive as a hobby. They are on an internship to learn about diving. The people in charge are always aloof and not paying attention to them.Soon they relieze that thay aren't really on an internship to learn, but as an excuse for their sponserors to search for some buried treaure, which they found on an dive.If you want to know what happens, read the book yourself."
4,DIVE,"DIVE Book:oneFour divers named kaz,dante,adrina,and star arn't the bestdivers. But they were chosen to explore the sea on there summervaction.They sould be on the look for the dangorus sharks and other fish for this challange.________________________________________________________________When i was finish with this book diving semmed like fun,but kind of scary.I wanted to do it with my family some day.The bookwas brusting with action.Igive it a 4 out of 5.________________________________________________________________If you like fishes and lots of action this is the book for you and your freinds."
3,a suspenceful read,"Gordan Korman's new book series, Dive is about Bobby Kazinski , Dante Lewis , Star Lee ,and Andrea Goldsmith's adventures under the sea.From this series, I learned many interesting facts about diveing.Although ,it took a long time for the plot to develope,but the book was quite good.Some details were unesesary, but they became clear when I got further into the series.I enjoyed this book."
2,Focus,"Frankly, I normally like books that are part of a series, but this one just had way too many references to what may have been other books in a series about this vampire clan...and set ups for future books. Umpteen backstories that had nothing to do with the plot of this book. Rather than wanting to buy the other books, it just scared me off. And using the same jokes over and over...ghoulish...girlish. Enough! And then with all these backstories, there are references to things that happened to the main characters that are just jumped over. It will mention when something or other happened, but never described the actual thing happening. Dump the backstories and focus! Could have been a good story if the author had focused, but instead I found myself thinking that the book was just way too long."
3,Little romance here --- 3.5 stars,"While I really enjoyed Laurey's previous books in this series, this one left me wanting. The thriller/suspense plot retains reader interest and is certainly complicated. However, it's not very deep (or original). The villain is a truly nasty piece of work (though stereotypical despite being a vampire), yet he is easily dispatched in the end. Not well done.Worse, there is little romance in this paranormal romance. Angela & Tom argue, but there is no other tension between them. The love scenes are without true passion. In fact, there's little deep emotion (other than fear) for either character. The most emotional scene in the book involves Justin, Stella, and Sam.This one is a real let down after the other two. Read it if you want to go on with the series (and I definitely advise the others first), but I don't recommend buying it."
2,Disappointed.,"I read the first two books of this series, I loved the first book. The second was okay, and the third..I was just truely disappointed. Every book seemed the same..each vampire who has never fallen inlove with a mortal finds a women they simply cannot resist. The first one had an interesting story to it, and honestly the series should have just followed Kit and the women(can't remember her name}. I got maybe half way through the book, and have yet to finish it."
3,Belt failure,"The idea is great. I was impressed with the sander, however the quality of the belts has something to be desired. I usually find belt sanders to use the belt to the bitter end (until the grit just plain wears out). However, the 80 grit belts may develop too much heat (my inpression) for the glue used to join the belt together. With this sander i was never able to use the belt to the end, in fact out of 11 belts used 8 of them failed prematurely all spliting right at the joint and as if the glue on the back patch (looks like tape) just seperated from the belt. No tears and the belt itself was in very good conditon. None of the belts lasted as long as usually could be expected the three others also failed but put up a better fight."
1,"EXACTLY the same as""Holly Wood""","I gave this one star not because of the music on the CD, which is great, but because unless you look closely you might think this is a different CD from ""Holly Wood"".Both ""Good People All"" and ""Holly Wood"" contain EXACTLY the same tracks. They are not on the same label and they have shuffled the order of the songs, but the content is identical. I suppose I should have looked more closely before purchasing both. Save your money and purchase ""Holly Wood"", which is still in print."
2,Not sure a man can write about this in a way that speaks to me.,"I have just decided not to finish this book, after getting through about 140 pages of it.I find the case studies and clinical stories are too much emotionally; it is simply too sad to read about chromosomal abnormalities and stillbirths. Maybe the book turns around at the end, but thus far the science outweighs the hope and the sad case studies about women losing their babies feel relentless. Maybe I am wrong, but somehow I feel that if a woman wrote this book it would offer empathetic insights that a man is simply not capable of when it comes to this topic.If you have recently suffered a miscarriage and are still grieving, then this may not be the book that meets the most sensitive needs."
1,Biased and flawed logic,"Clearly written by someone who has not read all the studies and has a grudge against ""Beer Babies"""
5,Best book I've found,"this is definitely the best book that I've found on the subject of miscarriage. I have had three miscarriages and one child and have been told many differing opinions from doctors. When I suffered my last miscarriage at 37, a doctor told me that I had only a 40% chance of having another successful pregnancy. As with any medical condition, you have to be your own advocate, and this book is the best starting place that I've found to make the journey.Since my last miscarriage, I saw a doctor that suggested IVIG. the procedure would cost me $9000. I consulted another doctor in the book, who gave me a better explanation of my situation and now I feel comfortable trying to move forward without expensive interventions.When you experience several miscarriages you are faced with a maze. I found this book essential in figuring out the best way for my husband and I to proceed."
5,A must-have for those interested in ancient music,"This is the only ""historically informed recording"" I know of where one will find the scattered fragments of music from Ugarit and earlier Mesopotamian civilizations as well as from ancient Egypt, in addition to some fragments of Greek music not published earlier by this ensemble. As such, its importance for students of the music of the Ancient Near East is invaluable. It has extensive liner notes like its predecessor (although never enough for this student) and good references to the source materials."
4,making money on bombs,"this sarcastic take ,that chevy loves to do,on americas ability to profit and take lives...it describes us well...it gives us a chan"
4,Barely 4 stars,"I prefer reverse tooth or fine blades when I don't want splinters. That way I can keep a close eye on the cut which is harder with these. If you are using a straight edge I suppose they would be more useful. For a truly clean cut I make a rough cut about 1/8"" larger and then use a router and a straight edge for the final clean up. I would spend my money on good blades rather than these."
5,A classic in its genre.,"This is the recording I always return to. I am now buying my third copy. It made me want to play guitar and has inspired a generation of guitarists. If you've ever wondered just how great medieval music can sound, listen to this recording. The versions of Scarborough Fair and My Johnny Was a Shoemaker combine elements of Jazz, Folk, and Pop in a way that was original when they were first recorded and which haven't been matched since. If you want to get to know Early Music, start here. It doesn't get much better."
4,Beautiful,"This is a very nice cd, but I have to admit, I don't reach for it as much as ""Sir Johnalot"". This is really a rennaisance sound, completely acoustic, and very relaxing. Renbourn is a virtuoso guitarist."
4,Very Fun and Exciting Shooter!!,Don't believe the 1 star review. This game is very exciting and fun and it includes some really great levels. There is some great Slo-Mo camera shots.You will really enjoy this game if you like a good Shooter..
4,this is a good FPS with a few problems,"well i just finished the demo of this game and have to say its very fun basicly your a cop thats going to protect your city alot of people say its relly bloody but i just went to the options and turned off the blood and if the langue gets to you you can just turn the volume down, but for the game play its very fun and has some cool things to do like a hostage situation were when the bad guy trys to reload it will go into slow motion to give u a better chance to shoot him but if you get too close then he will panic and shoot the hostage i also liked that extra mission objective that i think it said if i did it then i would get an extra amo clip for my pistol that shield relly comes in handy too so relly this is a incridble fun shooter and if u turn off the blood not relly that gory or bloody. i hope this review help some."
1,Sick,"I just played the demo to this game... well actually I has to quit. I like violent video games and all... most of the time. But this was ultra violent and ultra bloody. The GTA games were violent but cartoonish- and they gave you something else to do; car races, etc.This game is a non-stop killing machine of blood, bombs and guts. It takes quite a bit to turn my stomach... and this game does it."
5,Great CD Single,"Having just been in Europe recently (where we purchased this CD), this song is quite popular. Even though it is sung in French, it is a great song to to listen to."
1,Plot didn't grab me,"I started this book thinking it would be a gripping story of healing and transformation. Instead, the plot just never really developed. It read more like a dream sequence than a story, which might be interesting to some folks. But for anyone looking for a good read, in my book, this is not it."
5,Pure pop for all people,"Mike Lane's new cd is a pop lovers dream.... for all of you who love the Lemonheads, Material Issue, the Shoes, the Beatles or XTC this CD is for you!! From the opening salvo ""I'm a 45"", a tribute to vinyl from way before Pearl Jam's ""Spin the Black Circle"", to the closing track ""Sets the Sun""....pure pop music.Treat yourself to some sticky pop sweetness and get this CD!! You'll be glad that you did"
4,useful book,This is a nice and convenient and useful version of the manual. It is helpful to me in my current position as an outpatient therapist.
4,"a lean, mean DSM-IV-TR","This book is the less intimidating version of the complete ""DSM-IV-TR"". It's a no nonsense summary of the salient points of the complete text, and in that sense it's somewhat more practical and quicker to use. Professionals in the field of psychiatry may want to keep it handy. Also, for those outside the field of psychiatry, it could also be considered as an alternative to buying the complete ""DSM-IV-TR"", though I would suggest the complete book for those most interested in getting a thorough look at the bible of psychiatry. Avery Z. Conner, author of ""Fevers of the Mind""."
3,Great Book!,Great for needing to know the codes in DSM. I understand however that a new one is coming out so you might want to wait to purchase the new one. Thanks
5,Spiral makes life easier,"I love that this desk reference to the DSM-IV-TR is a spiral bound version as it makes flipping through it so much easier. This small, lightweight version is so much easier to carry around than the full DSM! I keep it on me at all times and love love love the spiral."
5,Desk Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR,Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for and exactly what I wanted and needed.
2,Long Way Home,"The book arrived in good shape but it seemed to take several weeks to arrive. I ordered other items at the same time that were shipped by another vendor and they arrived in a day or so. I thought Amazon would be much better than an obscure company, but I was wrong. I would never order a book again, since I can go to a bookstore and have it in an hour."
5,Surprised,My school was charging way too much for this book which is a necessity for any counseling major I was content and quite elated with the price it was less than any book store around. and practically brand new.
2,format problem,"nice and handy, but i don't like the spiral format. pages are flimsy and begin to rip and shear off shortly after purchase even with careful moderate use. just a waste of money. the only difference between the quick and the desk is the inclusion of the coding chart with the desk reference."
4,Easy to carry around and stays open where you left it,"If you need to take your DSM with you, this one is usually sufficient. I prefer the spiral binding because the other format tends to close itself. It would be nice if the categories were easier accessible, for example with indentions on the side. I overcame this problem by marking the categories with small plastic tabs on the side.Overall great especially if you use it to look up criteria for diagnoses with which you are familiar."
4,Desk reference DSM-IV-TR,This version is extremely helpful. The copy I was using before was falling apart due to binding issues and over use. This book has a spiral binding and is a breeze to use when looking anything up.
4,A Must-Have,This a great buy....Value for money. Serves you well for on call. The hard bound copy is better.
4,Music that speaks to the primitive and moves your hips,The album has a combination of tribal/animist rhythms and deep emotional power that really makes my hips move. Great stuff for getting all your juices flowing!
5,Touches Your Heart,This book is a jewel! It is beautifully written and a joy to read. You become so captivated by the characters you feel like you could sit in their kitchen and have a good conversation with them. 'The River of My Fear' will warm your heart.
3,Nothing to write home about,"There is nothing bad about this album whatsoever. The instruments are all well played, the compositions are well thought out. So why a generic rating of a three you might be wondering. For me the answer is simple. Melodic death metal is one of those sub-genres within metal that has a definite expiration date. I would recommend this album highly to someone who has had little exposure to the sub-genre. I have a few albums by a few select bands from within Melodic Death Metal that I love, but I find it increasingly harder to find myself enthralled by new efforts (even by a band this talented). I much prefer At the Gates and early Arch Enemy to this album/band. They are a much rawer, but still retain melody."
5,My Favorite Metal Album Ever,"When I say this is my favorite metal album, I gotta give the context.I'm not a real metal head, I listen to all genres (except country).I like bands that express from deep within, rather than posturing or reiterating genre staples.My favorite artist is actually Erykah Badu, my favorite band is a toss up between Tool and DT.This is the album that got me hooked on DT. The opening riff is so bad ass, its so complicated yet simple. The harmony on Cathode Ray Sunshine is incredible, the melody of Treason Wall is fantastic. I really love the lyrics of Hours Passed in Exile and Cathode Ray Sunshine.Anyone who knows anything about melodic death metal already knows Dark Tranquillity are founders of the genre and the only remaining band still doing it.This album is perhaps their finest, and certainly is the epitome of melodic death metal."
4,better than most in this genre,"Takes a couple listenings to get used to his voice, and the music, but this is a very good death metal band, not your average ""I got my head in a toilet bowl and I'm trying to sing"" band. Good talent, great anger!! Give it a couple spins :)"
4,Good stuff,"I loved Projector and was somewhat disappointed in Haven. This one is definitely closer to Projector style-wise, but still different. Very heavy and memorable riffs and the keyboards are fairly subtle for the most part. This is an excellent CD."
4,"Great, but it could be even greater.","If you've failed to notice, Dark Tranquillity has a habit of releasing a new album around the same time as In Flames. ""Damage Done"" continues the tradition, being the counterpart to ""Reroute to Remain."" ""Damage"" is by far the better album. The melodies aren't as insipid, bland and marshmallow-y sounding. The lyrics make much more sense than ""Reroute""'s generic stereotypical pop-nu-metal kludge. The songs are not as incredibly formulaic and stiff, and it's just plain HEAVIER and more driving.However, ""Damage"" is a small regression for DT. While not as mechanical as the structure of ""Reroute""'s songs, ""Damage""'s songwriting is more ""traditional"" and formulaic than the dazzling, unpredictable tempo and melody changes on ""Mind's I"". Gone are all singing, acoustics, and ""mellowness"" in general, creating an album that for me just sounds a little stripped.This is still a great album, the album ""Reroute to Remain"" was meant to be, if you will."
3,Good but could not really get into it,"I am a definite fan of metal in all forms . With that said there is one thing that ""for me"" is a deciding factor and that is the singer's growl. For me band like ""In flames"" and Dark Tranquility"" are not my cup of tea because the singers voice is just to high pitched. If you are not like me (which you are probubly not) and a metal fan who doesn't mind a more higher pitched lead singer then you will like this album. I will stick to Opeth, Nile and Fear Factory."
4,Good melodic death metal,"I'm not a huge Dark Tranquillity fan, but nobody can deny their innovative approach to making music. After all, they were the creators of the Gothenberg style, along with close associates In Flames. Damage Done is a very good album. The bonus track, ""I, Deception"" is definitely the highlight. All of the songs are at least worthy of three stars, and averaged out, it's probably on the same playing field, if not a little better, than In Flames' newest offering. The major difference is that Dark Tranquillity has stuck to the melodic death metal formula, while In Flames has taken a more... I don't want to use the 'n-word' (nu-metal) because that denotes lack of talent and creativity... but not melodic death. Basically, lovers of the old Gothenberg metal scene should stick to Dark Tranquillity. Damage Done isn't their best album, but it still rocks.If there's one thing holding DT back, it's their damn vocalist..."
2,TOO HEAVEY,These donuts were much heavier than typical donuts and sat at the bottom of my stomach. Also the cream was a bit tasteless.
5,Not your fatty donut!,"They are different than a regular donut, but I really like them!!!! They are filling and really satisfy a sweet tooth!"
4,Stylish,These shorts are comfortable and stylish for less than half what they charge at the local surf shops for the same product.
5,Gift,Bought it for my friend as a Christmas present! She said she loves it and that is very beautiful. Now I want one for myself!
2,JHL cologne,I've worn this product since it's conception and was always quite satisfied until now. The bottle I received was shelf worn with little fragrance. I should have sent it back instead of pitching it into the trash.
1,Mirisch Corp Hawaii by James Michener,"This is a sham. I wanted and thought I bought Micheners book Hawaii and I got a 12 page movie pictorial that is useless. I reread the description and found no indication that this was not Micheners book. I have a business card for Heart for Ethiopia (Ray and Lauralee Lindolm) and will call and complain, probably to no avail. Amazom must be careful on what they include as descriptors, they can and are misleading. Carl Moore"
2,More style than substance,"This is a beautiful little book of tapas recipes, with tasteful art direction and lovingly photographed food. However, while it dazzles with presentation, and I enjoyed looking at it, I found the actual selection of recipes lacking. It might be good for a few dinner parties, but after that, you've pretty much exhausted the possibilities.Perhaps the key is in the title: ""Casual Spanish Cooking"" - casual being the operative word. If you have a friend who likes to dabble in cooking and appreciates eye-candy, this book would make a great gift.On the other hand, if you're looking for a real work-horse of a cookbook for tapas and other small Mediterranean dishes, check out Little Foods of the Mediterranean by Clifford A. Wright. With over five times as many recipes as this title, plus a wealth of supplemental info, it won't leave you hungry!"
1,horrible,would not recommend this torch for any application. i could not even get it to work once. extremely horrible design. the seller didnt even want it back........
2,Disappointing,"If you think this book details the divurgence of American culture in the 1800s, you will be disappointed. Author spends too much time encapsulating the plots of dozens of novels, some of them rather obscure. His main point of the south as a declining culture and thus a culture winding its way to secession out of frustration is dubious. Author spends a lot of time detailing the decline of Virginia's worn out tobacco plantations but chooses not to discuss the spectacular economic growth of the South's western cotton plantations."
4,Learning to move on,"Frances Brooklyn has just lost her beloved husband Stephen to a heart attack, and she is adrift in the world trying to cope. Her sister-in-law Zoe, her niece Tabitha, and her adopted son Henry are all there for her, but Stephen - the memory of Stephen - consumes her. Near the end she meets a nice man named Morris, which just might develop into something, but more importantly Frances no longer has the need to dwell in the past. The future beckons. A quietly captivating, well-written novel."
3,Empathetic,"Lively exercises her powers of empathy to portray a woman suffering intense loss over the death of her husband. At times I got a little tired of the woman, but then she begins to recover from the worst of her grief, and other characters become a little more important. The long paragraph with which the novel ends is exceptional - if you don't read the book, at least read that paragraph"
4,Sad but hopeful,Perfect Happiness is about just that. A widow trys to be happy after her husband dies. Lively's descriptions of how time heals is comfortingly accurate.
4,Back To Basics,"I bought this to review long forgotten material. I find the authors' approach clear and easy to follow.If you want the basics without the theory, I recommend this study guide.As with other Schaum's Outlines, I have found a few, just a few discrepencies in the answers given for the problems."
5,Statics,"This book is a great self teacher of statics and beam mechanics. It has the best treatment of the ""singularity function"" method for beam loading that I have read."
4,Simple and easy,"Good buy for the price, covers most of the topics I was interested in.. Would buy similar books from amazon, need more new publishers. This books looks old to me."
1,book has many mistakes,This book is full of mistakes. I spend more time checking the author's work that I do practicing. Don't waste your money or time with this.
1,Purchase 2 Fox Run Scoops,Both Fox Run Scoops jumped the gear for the scoop release arm the first use. Worthless. Returned for refund because 2 out of 2 failed to provide satisfactory service.
5,Legendary recordings,"These are the legendary Sun recordings that laid the foundation of Rock and Roll and of Elvis' career. These are the songs that Elvis recorded for Sun records from his early demos in 1953 right on through his first commercial singles. Several of the songs were regional hits and some charted on the national country chart in the US, including his first national number 1 hit ""I Forgot to Remember to Forget"" which topped the US country singles chart in 1955. An outstanding collection!"
5,One of a Kind,"Indispensable for any lover of acoustic guitar, incomparable musicianship, evocative and alchemical, almost beyond categorization. Not for the faint of heart, attention span challenged, or narrow-minded, the close listener is rewarded by the enchanting melodies, pulsing rhythms, and never-heard-before virtuosity. One of my all time favorites, someday perhaps yours also?"
4,Two Great Talents,"This is an album of blues, folk, and ragtime-styled instrumentals, no vocals. It is culled from various vinyl LPs, including Under The Volcano, which I bought in the 70's, originally on the Flying Fish label. The music is lively and distinctly beautiful. It never fails to excite me.Apparently, these two performers came together by accident when a German concert promoter billed them as a duo at a festival. There are an equal number of songs written by each of them on this CD. Just two acoustic guitars - great stuff!"
3,Cute littel book... but not so inspiring...,"A cute little book with 25 patterns - not all are wearable or would be new to crocheters, but some are worth the book.I'll share some pics, so make up your own mind!"
2,Beautiful but difficult to follow,"I was very excited about this book and even bought special yarn to create my first scarf, only to find out that it was impossible to follow the instructions, I tried numerous times to make sense of the number of chains to do to start the project so the pattern would work and finally gave up. I'm quite an experienced crhochetter when using patterns and can normally decipher even vintage patterns, but I couldn't work it out with these instructions. Really disappointed."
4,"Beautiful scarves, requires some pattern experience","I just recently purchased this book, mostly based on the excellent reviews. I'm a longtime crocheter, with little experience in following patterns. The scarf on the front of the book is stunning, but I haven't gotten the nerve yet to tackle all the color changes. I did try one of the patterns (Mohair Ripple Scarf) and had to give up when I couldn't get the ripple pattern to work. I ended up with something I can't even call ""freehand crochet."" Not sure if it's my inexperience, or if there is a flaw in the pattern itself! My thoughts after that fiasco: this is not a book for beginners! The unusual yarns listed inside can be purchased on Ebay or at upscale yarn stores, however, and if you're good, you can swap out your own yarns for those listed with success. Bottom line: I intend to get better so I can make all these gorgeous patterns!"
4,7.5 OUT OF 10,"I enjoy intricate crochet work, that's a challenge, takes time and looks like a piece of art at the end. The picture of the scarve on the front is what got my attention. I ordered this book and was a bit disappointed with the patterns inside. Some of the scarves in this book is very plain. I must say the majority could be spiced up a little by substituting the yarn color. There are a couple of very unique scarves in here, and that makes this book worth buying. What bothers me the most is the yarn - I usually buy my yarn at Joann's, Michael's or WalMart. The yarns called for in these patterns are exotic names I've never heard of before, for example ""Le Fibre Nobili"", ""Filatura di Crosa"", ""Muench Yarns"" to name a few. I have never seen these before where I usually buy yarn (maybe I missed it - if I did, I apologize)."
5,A fantastic CD,"I bought this CD in '98, and it remains one of my favorites. My three year old son and I jam to it night and day.The first five tracks are particularly incredible. The album is funky enough for freeway driving on a sunny day, and mellow enough for just relaxing at home."
5,Awesome..,This Cd is Jai's best..I heard him at this little club in Berkeley called Ashkenaz..and he was in a trance..Fantastic music to mellow out..I listen to it during my commute..and it totally drains out the tension of the work day.. I wish Jai puts out some new music..his recent CDs mostly have the same songs..the Talveen Singh remix of this CD is a disaster..doc
3,It's OK if you like jazz improv - but...,"I agree with the review of youraveragemahayanist. The only thing I would add is this: if you're looking for the Krishna Das feeling, this isn't it."
1,Jai Uttal's voice ruins it for me.,"I really enjoy Indian Fusion music. I know Jai Uttal is quite popular and I listened to sample tracks on this CD and was impressed with some of the instrumentals. However on receiving the CD and listening to the full tracks, I was very disappointed. Jai Uttal's voice ruins it for me. I simply don't like the sound of his voice and there's too much of it. He sounds like a white guy doing a very poor and muffled job on bhajans. His voice is flat, monotonous, and off pitch. And he butchers the correct pronunciation of the sanskrit bhajans. Some of the instrumentals are pretty good, then disappointedly his voice kicks in and dominates most of each track. After so much of it, you have to switch it to the next track only for a repeat of the same thing. His album graphics and titles are pretty cool, but don't be mislead."
5,A Really Fun Game,"This game is really great!! It is so much fun! I wouldn't reccomend playing it by yourself, but with a friend. I even got my mom, who doesnt play many video games to play it with me, we both liked it so much that after we rented it we bought it. I liked how I could change my character, but I enjoyed being Danny Phantom best. Each character has their own unique powers. It's a great game and I would reccomend it for two or more players. Its similar to the Shrek 2 game in which it is like a one player game but there are more than one character that goes through the game. If you're looking for a great birthday present I would reccomend this game especially if the person likes The Fairy Odd Parents, Jimmy Neutron, Spongebob Squarepants or Danny Phantom. This game does not dissapoint. Go out and rent it, or buy and and you will see why this game is awesome."
3,To Be played by more than one person.,The game is a lot of fun when you have two or more player. My kid (six year old) only enjoyed the game when there was some else playing along.
3,Makes for good Father/Son time........,"You have to work through the scenarios. It can be tedious, but I have used it to teach my son to not give up, and that really no task is insurmountable. Just keep trying until you succeed."
2,For die-hard McGregor or Zeta-Jones fans only,"This is pure junk food for a ""before they were big"" look at Ewan McGregor and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Not memorable and with only mildly entertaining moments."
4,Blue Juice the reivew,"In one part of the moive I think you sould look away on that one. Trush me. The legend is here it's JC (Sean Pertwee). In the moive he has the look's and fame and he has it all: And he has the hottest girl in town her name is Chloe (Catherine Zeta Jones). Ok one of his friend's (Ewan McGregor) enter him in a dangerous surfing contest, poor JC he must risk his life or his one ture love.Which one is it going to be? The girl or the contest???In the moive he said he is out of shape and he can't surf like that anymore. In the moive he said he almost die form that foolishly stuff. Once he had it all but now I don't know about that one.Well, enjoy the moive I did you will too!!!!!"
3,Nice way to spend an afternoon,"Who would have thought there was such a thing as a British surfer movie, yet here it is. As the Amazon reviewer stated Britain is an island, so it should seem obvious:-). It's interesting to see Catherine Zeta-Jones before her ""Zorro"" and Michael Douglas days and she's cute and quite charming. Sean Pertwee is also cute and sympathetic as a guy torn between his extended adolescence and starting grown-up life in his 30's. This isn't heavy viewing but it's an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours; plus you learn a bit about a little known ""surfer culture"". (It is British as shown by the fact that Pertwee's character's mates, including Ewan McGregor looking suitably grungy in the role of Dean--the chronic loser screw-up, are in London at the beginning of the film and drive to where Pertwee's character is. You can't drive from London to Australia<g>)"
4,A Fun Surfing Themed Movie,This is simply a fun movie.The acting is not too bad. It's light hearted.Most age groups can relate to it.If this doesn't bring a smile to your face at some point then there's something wrong with you.
4,Hoag never disappoints,"I was hesitant about this book when I read the plot synopsis several months ago, but of course that all changed after the first few pages of this exciting new Hoag thriller. While I felt that the plot hopped around a bit, and some of the writing was choppy, it was still first-rate. The characters were fleshed out and well-written, and the ending really threw me for a loop! Hoag wrapped all the loose ends up seamlessly. I recommend this book to anyone who values edge-of-your-seat suspense and superb characterization!"
1,What was Ms Hoag thinking?,"I just can not believe any other reader gave this book anything above one star (are there two different books around, if so, I want the other one). The first 10 pages are an account of driving a bike through LA - the description was so complicated, I just could not picture it - then half a page something else - and then ten more pages of how to drive a bike through LA. Then a boring scene car chasing bike, but again, the description of the scenery was so convoluted, I just could not picture it. Boring, boring. Well, I finally stopped reading at the awful sentence 'His brain felt like it was swirling around a toilet bowl, ready to be sucked down the drain', for crying out loud, what horrible, horrible writing!!!"
5,Hoag delivers,"Tami Hoag has long been one of my favorite authors. As a lifelong resident of LA, I can tell she's done her homework on this one. From Hope Street to Chinatown, she has captured the whole stinking, smoggy mess.I must admit, the plot didn't thrill me at first but Jace, Kev, Tyler,et. al. drew me in with their quirky, fully realized ""lives.""Overall an excellent police procedural, a worthy addition to Ms. Hoag's fine bibliography."
3,Not The Kind I Thought,"I've been wanting to read this book for a while. But, unfortunately, it didn't turn out to be the knd of novel I expected it to be. I thought this was the kind of novel where there's lots of intense actions. Like a guy getting chased through out the book by a killer and keeps running away and being shot at, the kind of action that keeps your eyes on the book. Well, no, this was totally NOT the one I expected. It's just one of those guy-gets-killed-cops-come-and-investigate kind of novel. But the ending was great. It could probably raise the stars from 3 to 4 or 5, but this one I just can't do it. The title of the book pulled me in... It's suspense. Mystery novel. Not much actions.[A Bantam book. Copyright 2004 by Indelible Ink, Inc.]"
4,Jean,The story was excellent but I gave it four stars because the Kindle version did not go to the correct page when reopening the story.
5,FAST PACE STORY Unabridged Audio cd 11 cds,"Just read the first few paragraphs concerning a late afternoon in the life of Jace Damon, bike messenger for a courier service and I promise you that the next time one of those guys comes flying past you, you will admire him.A harrowing car versus bike chase through downtown L.A. results in Jace barely escaping with his life - and the package. Everyone Jace cares about has become a target for the killers as they try to find Jace to recover the mysterious package.Jace refused to prove his innocence since he is raising his younger brother alone after the death of their mother avoiding government social services. The brothers live daily under the bureaucratic radar to stay together.Here is a story that is gripping, fast moving and enthralling. A must purchase for anyone wanting a thriller."
5,Solid Suspense !,"Everytime a Tam Hoag novel comes out, one wonders if she can possibly do better than the last novel. She never disappoints. This book is no exception.Kev Parker, LAPD homicide detective, is on the trail of a young messenger boy who has become the number one suspect of the murder of a bottom-feeding attorney. But, things don't seem quite right. The messenger himself seems to be running for his life from others who are interested in silencing him.Parker doesn't buy any of it and tries to unravel what has really occurred. In the process he ends up trying to save the life of the suspect.On a romp throughout some of the seamier sides of LA, Parker finally stumbles upon the solution.You simply cannot put this novel down. Pure excitement from page to page. Tami Hoag once again outdoes herself. She is, without a doubt, one of the most exciting writers of suspense.Densel MyersYukon, Oklahoma"
4,A stellar effort from a quality mystery writer,"Hoag writes a good suspense novel told from multiple points of view. The strength of this is in the fact that you get a variety of settings, making the book fuller and richer. Her characters feel authentic. They're likable but still real enough to have hard edges. The ending had an unexpected and melancholy twist and there was true resonance to the aftermath. I've been reading Hoag for some time and this is one of her best works yet."
5,Good Thriller,"The poor messenger gets himself into a bind because he was making his last delivery of the day and ends up finding his client dead.He and his brother are very poor and he tried to keep his brother safe from harm.Someone is being blackmailed, but you don't find out until later.It was a page turner...read it last summer in about a day."
1,A boring thriller,"I found this thriller to be quite boring. None of the characters were believable, and neither was the premise. The motivations of the main character Jace are not fully explained. When reading, I felt like I was reading a storyboard that had not been fully fleshed out."
2,where's the music?,"although i like the subject matter here, i've got to say i'm not sure why this writer chose to write poems, other than the fact that each piece is short. one could write these as prose poems and it wouldn't really change the reading of the pieces. and too many poems begin like this: 'alone on a hill above the festival, I listen past field noise' . . . I listen, I hear, I see. I.I. I.I. too much of the romantic bluster that I suppose is supposed to be a sort of Whitmanesque/ deep-image conflation but feels self-conscious. I love some of the poems, don't get me wrong, some wonderful images swirl up as the imagination confronts nature in this book. But I wish the poet played with perspective more. and I wish I got more of a feeling of music from the line breaks, which seem awfully arbitrary to me."
4,"excellent product, bad shipping",Burned about half of the cake so far on my Teac DV-W58E and had two coasters. Overall seems to be a very good product so far for the price.Amazon's packaging is very poor--the box had four airbags in it and the cakebox rolled all around the box. Had to send the first shipment back because it was damaged. Replacement item was shipped in slightly better condition and was not damaged.Amazon's replacement policy is good though. They shipped the item out before they received the returned item. This is very nice compared to other e-tailers!I would've given 5 stars but I did get two coasters afterall...
5,best rated,"these ridata are rated the best and most reliable (at both burning and standngup to age/use) on all the expert sites like videohelp and digitalfaq. the person having problems below most likly has a fiddled with their firmware etc. the fact that they recommend meomorex, whichis rated average to poor by hundreds of expert users, shows they are confused."
1,THEY DIDNT WORK FOR ME AND SAVED AWFUL,"Hi I am just so upset with these DVD's I got some and was so happy that I got such a great Price, But when It came time to watch them some worked okay and most of the others didn't. Later when I went to watch the ones I had already watched they ruined some how, I was just trying to see some of the movies we took from Vegas, which was a bunch of time taking them and some very memorable moments that we can never bring back and Nothing. I just want to let you all know so you dont have the same awful experience, There cheap but the ones I got didn't work good at all.any questions feel free to e-mail me at mr_gt_mustang@yahoo.comthanks"
2,A big spindle of garbage,"I've used Ritek disks for quite some time, just never from Amazon. Couldn't pass up $29 for a 100 spindle of +r Ritek disks. My Plextor 708 coastered the first one at 8x. Looked at the disk and it looks like someone sprayed hairspray or something around the outer 3/4"" of the surface. Great. Look throught the spindle and the first 20 disks look about the same way. Finally get one to complete and the outside of the disk (end of movie) still won't play. Thanks for the great quality control and the giant spindle of crap."
1,Beware of Ritek from Amazon,"Buy these disks from any other retailer, I have bought the same brand and type from other retailers and never had any COASTER.First time I bought from Amazon and 25 coasters and increasing, tried with different burners, (Benq 1620 PRO, Nec 3520) and different speeds, problem is present only in Ritek sold by Amazon."
2,Flagging Quality,"I've been buying RiData/Ritek media for several years now (many hundreds of discs) and, up until recently, have been quite happy and have had no problems with them. Now it seems that their product quality is slipping. The last two batches of these DVDs have had about 20-30% defective (visible spots on the disk). I'm moving on to a better brand."
2,Quality media... I don't think so,"[...]Unfortunately, I am disappointed. The media is indeed ricohjpn01 which is a very good quality media. However, I am beginning to think these disks have not passed quality control and are being sold at a discount (that is despite the fact that the rebate deadline is 14 days from the date of purchase and it goes to TCA Niagara Falls, a place notorious for rejecting rebates). My spindle looks like it was thrown together - the disks do not align properly. A few disks had specs on the outer edges which decreased the burn quality significantly with my Benq1620, as check by the CD Speed tool in Nero. The rating dropped down to 85% after reading 96-97% throughout the disk. Most disks also develop shadows/dark patches, usually on the inner tracks, visible after burning the disks. The quality scans will show a bunch of spikes in those regions and the rating will drop down from 96% to 60-70%. All in all money not well spent - these are a lemon."
1,Waste of Money,"Sure its way way cheaper compared to other products but if you will calculate the success rate versus failure, this product will end up more expenssive than the brand names. Bottom line, you get what you paid for."
1,Don't recommend,I have been burning Memorex DVD+R for a year with my HP DVD 200e writer without a problem. Tried to use Ridata- each of 4 burn attemps failed- went back to using the Memorex with no problem. Returned Ridata to Amazon
1,junk,"WOW I always bought Memorex then did some research and bought these ridata and out of 50 I already had 5 bad disk!!! with memorex I've had 400 with just 1 bad disk... I don't have time in my life for this JUNK!!!! wish I never bought them!!!! If your cheep & a risk taker try these, I have 2 dvd burners & had problems w/ both of them with these disks, I WILL NEVER TRY THIS JUNK AGAIN!!!!"
2,Didn't work from the start,"I have ordered Royal registers for our Thrift Store before and have enjoyed their durability. However, I took this one out of the box and plugged it in to find that it didn't work at all. Very disappointing."
3,Nice but with definite drawback.,"I ordered this to replace an existing cash register that had issues. It was very similar to what I had so the employees would not have to experience a big learning curve during our busy season. It works well, with the exception that the paper used is thermal (expensive) and it rattles around in the machine making it noisy. My biggest complaint is that the tray is not removable so it can be stored safely when not in use. When I called Royal, I was told that some of this model had removable trays & some not. If I had known that, I would have purchased a different model."
1,"Cash Register is great, service is terrible","I own three Royal Cash Registers, all of them have worked well but when I called for service on one of them (The greeting couldn't be changed) I was connected with a ""technician"" in a foreign country and they not only couldn't understand the problem but kept telling me there was nothing in the data base. The ""technician"" knew absolutly nothing about the cash register or even what a cash register actually is. They're simply typing in a problem and expect an electronic database to provide an answer which you can't do if you don't know how to translate the user's description into something the database can recognise. I tried calling sales but they only sent me back to the ""service technicians"" They're a great machine as long as you don't need customer service."
3,"Worked well, for 3 years...","I've had this register for just over 3 years and it just froze up yesterday. I'm assuming it had something to do with me replacing the batteries but I can't be sure. It worked really well for the first 2 years, then the power went out and the backup batteries only store the information for about an hour or so then it dumped ALL my data. So, back to square one... had to re-program it all over again, quite the hassle. I'm now going to purchase a register that has some sort of backup system that does not require batteries. Oh, and this register is super loud... when I was ringing stuff up, I couldn't hear my customers talk to me! I'll be sure to rate the next register I buy!"
3,Not for the weekend gardener,"I believe this book would only be of interest to selected people. Those would be people who want to know that, for example ""pumila L. A small to large shrub of upright habit with downy youg shoots and point, coarsely toothed leaves. E North America. I 1762."" To be fair, there are probably botantist and perhaps nusary people who would recognise the value in this type of manual. My point is that to the layman this is of limited value. The one thing I did learn is to never buy a book with out at least seeing a table of contents. The main contents of this manual are the short descriptions, of which I provided an example."
2,Really? I mean really?,"Okay, I know the kids - particularly Greg - are not the greatest vocalists. It has a certain charm to it. But it's a freaking needledrop. And not an especially good one. Really MCA? I'd expect that from a budget, bootleg label - but MCA?"
1,O (Un)Holy Night,"How ironic. The Christmas song, ""O Holy Night"" is about the birth of Jesus. But just as Jesus was crucified, so too is ""Oh Holy Night""... by Greg Brady. I picked up this music cheaply to add to my expanding Christmas CD collection, expecting a sweet, novelty item I could enjoy listening to every year. Bottom line, it's not very good. The chorus work is tolerable, but as soloists, one wishes that Christmas is not the only thing the Grinch stole. He's more than welcome to bury every copy of this CD under Mount Crumpit for all eternity. Still, Christmas is a time to count one's blessings, so count this one: ""Christmas With The Brady Bunch"" is over in just under 21 minutes. That said, what about the ""The Voice of Christmas"" episode of the TV show where Mrs. Brady sang, ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" rather well. Why isn't that on the CD? After all, Mrs. Brady's a member of the Brady Bunch, too!"
2,Not the best they can do,"Don't waste your time. The songs are rather boring and don't really show off the true talent that we know The Brady Bunch has. If you're looking for good music from The Brady Bunch, I definitely recommend ""It's a Sunshine Day: The Best of the Brady Bunch"" instead. It has all their greatest hits, including the ones performed on the show, and much more variety than the Christmas CD."
4,Great for little kids!,"I suggest getting this ""Brady"" CD and enjoy from the second half of the CD forward. It seems the cute songs are great..like Frosty and Jingle bells.The slower Christmas songs in the first half are painful..it's true. However, this CD was a big hit for a kids party our family had and all the upbeat songs were great! It's for kids and Brady nostalgia folks."
5,Truly disturbing,"This is a stunning pair of videos, taken by Alex Jones, a reporter and talk radio host. It is profoundly disturbing that there is a group of American elites who, every summer, travel to the deep redwood groves in Northern California to attend a pagan ""ceremony"" to an owl god, who is none other than the ancient Moloch, to whom were offered human child sacrifices. And to think these elites include US presidents, vice presidents, cabinet ministers, and CEOs of the biggest corporations. Highly recommend!"
4,Five stars if you like the style...,"I've never been a huge fan of South African choral music, but I have to admit that this group, recorded early in 2002, with some rhythm players added to the mix, has a pretty creative approach to the style. Their songs are original and complex, with dynamic arrangements and swooping vocal interplays... It's a nice new twist on a genre that had gotten kind of static over the years. Worth checking out, particularly if you were already a fan of this sound."
4,Brain alert,This is an excellent question bank for step 2 which guided me for my step 2 preparation. According to me ...practice as many question as you can for step 2 to make your brain alert....the basic neccesity before the examination. I am sure the book will be a boon for Step 2 candidates.
4,Straight Ahead Biography of Cicero,"Cicero (The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician) is exactly what its author, Anthony Everitt, claims it to be in the sub-title. Cicero was an impressive figure living in an interesting time and it is important and necessary to have a biography such as this one come out to allow readers not steeped in classical studies, particularly Cicero's own writings, a chance to escape to this distant time which often has a resonance in our own difficult period. The author does a good job of hitting all the hot spots and smoothing out some of the political complexities for the general reader while still providing a feel for ancient Rome as Republicanism writhed toward its end."
5,Fascinating,This is a great Biography and description of Roman civilization and politics. You will learn a lot reading this book and enjoy the process. I love this book and can't wait to read more about Roman history.
2,Good for lawyers.,"Good book, but hard to get through all the trials that are detailed in this book. It does give a nice well rounded look into how politics hasnt changed much in the last 2000 years."
2,Disappointing,"I read 'Cicero' seeking insight into the mind of Rome's greatest orator, and was left wanting. Everitt's strength is in translating the Latin into simple, modern English. But 'Cicero' is no scholarly work, it's more an exposition on the man's life - little more than a book report. I was disappointed."
2,too much detail for me,"I was looking for a good book on Cicero, (my first on the subject.) However, I found the book to have a bit too much detail and it belabored every little event in his life too much for me. Perhaps that is kudos to the author, however if you are looking for famous quotations or a more concise summary of Cicero, this is not the book for you."
4,Great Read,"A very enjoyable and commpelling examination of an interesting man who lived in extremely interesting times. I very much enjoy reading histories and biographies and I find the VERY BEST popular histories string together the facts and dates into an insightful and compelling story, so while many reviewers took exception to the author's scholarship, it seems to me Everitt found the essense of this man and injected it into a very good narrative about both Cicero's life and the times in which he lived.So if you want a compelling and insightful read that takes you through a towering figure in the last days of the Roman Republic, GET THIS BOOK! And if you want a more complete examination of the Roman Republic and the god-like figures who moved through these times, I suggest you keep reading, because there are many books on the subject and no one volume could adequately capture all of the amazing facets of the late Roman Republic."
4,An interesting read for a fascinating man,"I really enjoyed this book about a tremendous time in history with larger than life characters. Unfortunately, I would have liked to have had more funny anecdotes or examples of Cicero's actual speeches; however, time probably lessens the humor as well as translation. Also, I was disappointed that little was mentioned about Clodia AKA ""Lesbia"" from Catullus's poetry. Despite these personal desires the book was an interesting and fascinating read."
2,Cicero: A Shallow Summarization,"I bought this book after devouring the ""Masters of Rome"" series by Colleen McCullough. I had hope for a more in depth, factual, biography of a figure that lived through many of the same events as McCullough covered. What I got instead was a cliff notes summary of the events of the man's life, with ridiculously few of biographical details, and far less information than the historical novels of McCullough. In fact, with a few exceptions, ""Cicero"" could have been written using McCullough's books as the SOLE SOURCE. I am not implying any plagiarism or anything of the kind, merely noting that a set of books marketed as historical fiction contain just as much useful information as a purportedly more serious and in depth work. I've yet to read other bios of Cicero yet, but skip this one."
4,The thrilling drama of the fall of the Roman Republic,"This is a well-written narrative of one of history's greatest dramas, the crises and civil wars of the late Roman Republic, with a spotlight on one of that drama's main players, a talented speaker, writer and politician about whose private life and thoughts we have considerable knowledge. This is a brilliant introduction to the topic for people who know little of Ancient Rome, and a fun read for someone who has already read alot about the period."
1,Maybe the worst thing i've ever read....,"This book was so boring. It did have a lot of dry details. The writing is confusing b/c time seems to not move in a straight line in this biography. Cicero comes off a pompous jerk and a completely unlikable character. I couldn't even finish this book it was so bad. I was forced to read it and I can't finish it. This book put me to sleep. Unless you're looking for a sleeping pill, leave this book on the shelf."
4,"Good, but ...","This is an excellent work. Very detailed. Sometimes too detailed. However, the author does not explain certain things, so it is difficult to understand and follow the plot. For example, regarding legislation, Ceasar is somehow able to bypass the Senate by going directly to the people. How is that and why was Ceasar able to do this when no one else could? This was not fully explained."
5,the best,Quite simply the BEST general purpose / fine woodwork blade in it's length bar none.FASTCLEANLONG LASTING
2,Could be better,"This CD is a poor peformance of some wonderful music. The sound quality is bad, and the rendition second rate. The wonderful piano music of Weber deserves better. The Konzertstuk, alone, is worth listening to."
1,Junk product,"Adapter cable causes ghosting of the television image. The image being fed from the s-video source cable is perfect, problem was replicated on another LCD television set. And yes, I plugged the cable into the correct composite video jack. Garbage, do not buy."
1,Very Disappointed....Don't buy....,Well they say you get what you pay for. With everything at Amazon I've bought you get much more quality than the amount you pay. Not in this case. This wire falls way short of just even an average analog video picture. The colors were over saturated and the contrast way too dark. I found a way around using this and the picture looks nice. Not recommended...
2,Not bi-directional :(,"Many of the S-video to RCA adapters on Amazon are described as being ""bi-directional"", so I assumed that this one was too. Bad assumption. I've got an RCA signal coming out of my DVD/VCR, and only an S-video jack free on my TV, so I wanted to use this cable to convert my RCA signal to an S-video input. It simply won't do the job, the picture quality is unwatchable, it looks like maybe only 1 or 2 colors of information (and not a full picture) is making it into the TV. I know that the TV's S-video input works fine because I get a clear picture with other S-video devices plugged into the same input jack on the TV.To be fair, this product's description does only refer to ""S-video signal to RCA input"", not the other way around. So that's why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of only 1. Oh well, time to try a bi-directional adapter..."
4,Doesn't convert the signal,I'm sure this well made product works as designed but your device (e.g. laptop) has to convert the S-video signal to analog (I guess) to work. This product won't do it. Should it say that on the specs?
5,WOrks,It does what it needs to do. You are not going to get S video quality but the video is view able. I use it on my CCTV DVR and it works great.
1,Does not function well,This item was purchased to convert S-video signal to an RCA input. The signal was very poor. Color on TV was wrong. Could barely see the images. Had to purchase another adapter to do the job. I threw this one in the trash.
4,Entertaining,"Character are good, expanded on previous characters. Well written. This allowed for me to continue reading the rest of the series without having to read previous books."
4,The real battle finally begins.,"This book mixes the core characters from the Conclave of Shadows with a few new (but very familiar) ones, such as Tad and Zane (think Erik and Roo from the Serpentwar saga). Thankfully, Tad and Zane's training only takes up one or two chapters and is not the main focus of this book, as it was with Talon of the Silver Hawk in his eponymous book.If I seem to be comparing this book to earlier books in the grander Riftwar saga, it is because many of them share a common story: ordinary person actually has magical or superhuman powers and is trained to be a super-weapon against evil. Flight of the Nighthawks is a nice break because we finally get to see a bunch of these superhumans start to battle it out against the super bad guy, Leso Varen. The story keeps you moving along to a grand ending that makes you want to pick up the next book, Into a Dark Realm, right away."
4,continuing story,"Holds up to the rest of the body of work for Feist. I am a bit tired of the same old thing though... still a good read, there seems to be nothing even this good from todays' writers of the genre."
3,No development,"I've been waiting months to write a review about this book (I read it last year in Australia, and waited until it was available on Amazon), now I can't even remember what I wanted to say.To me, the book seemed like a cheap imitation of ""Prince of the Blood"". It's almost like Raymond uses a program that warns him he's approaching the 365-page mark and tells him it's time to wind it up.This book took me nowhere. Maybe I reminisce too much about the ""Riftwar Saga"" or ""Serpentwar Saga"" to remain focused. It's not about new characters, it's about development. As my reading matures, I guess I assume the like with the writing style of my favourite authors.Sorry to say, I found this book disappointing from the point of view of an avid fan. The same way I found as a youth, that David Eddings only had one good story in him. Maybe as a new reader things will appear different, but I was left empty."
4,Flight of the Nighthawks,"Engrossing story that follows on from the Conclave of Shadows Triology and continues with the impending incursion of the Dasati on the world of Midkemia, and the return of the insidious Nighthawks in Kesh, as well as portray the evolution of all the favourite characters from the series. Very good read."
4,Docks Review,"An excellent book, filled with the character draw that Feist is famous for. Makes you just as eager for the second book in the series."
1,I'm reminded of why I no longer read Feist,"I have a soft spot for Raymond Feist. He was the first fantasy author that captured my attention and imagination. However, since I have grown and begun to read new and better authors such as Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind I have found the works of Feist to be short, the characters under-developed and recycled, and overall disappointing. Maybe it's just that I prefer epic fantasy books which take more than a few hours to read and actually take the time to familiarize the reader with the characters and their struggles towards a resolution of the problem, but now I laugh at myself for being such a fan of Raymond Feist. If he is going to make his books less than 400 pages long he needs to come out with them more frequently. Why wait around for a year for a short and disappointing afternoon of reading? If you want to be entertained, I suggest you read the Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan or the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind."
4,"""The storm had broken...""","The story begins with the first lines from Magician, as Pug dreams. He makes a return as one of the main characters in this continuation of the Conclave of Shadows saga. The threat of the Talnoy and Dasati are growing and the Conclave's most powerful magicians Pug, Miranda, Nakor, and Magnus, now take a large role.We see old characters and new characters scattered amongst Keshian politics, murder, and intrigue. However, the character development is somewhat lacking, although, not as badly as in the previous three books.The plot was solid, but the writing did not do it justice. In previous books we get at least a few glimpses of the enemy's agenda, but here, we are unaware for a long time of who or what the real threat is.I especially liked getting a few tidbits of provenance (as the author likes to say :) ) on Nakor, the enigmatic Isalani.I am a big fan of Feist and I would say this is his best work since Shards of a Broken Crown."
2,DANGEROUS TOOL,"Obviously designed by some one who never uses a corkscrw in a professional setting. The knife is on the same end as the boot and very close to the worm, it is counter intuitive and clumsy to use. Can easily cut yourself. Also, since when should a waiters' key be a heavy piece of steel? If you work as a wine steward and open dozens if not hundreds of bottles per night you need a reliable, light weight tool.Relegate this one to the corkscrew curiosity collection, there have been many over the past 100 years."
4,"Well made solid product, not for professional use","I have been bartending for 12 years, that being said I have used and come across many wine keys, corkscrews in my day. This particular opener appealed to me for my home, having friends over and entertaining. After receiving this product, this is my professional opinion. It is a well made, well constructed product. It happens to look and feel as good in your hands as well as it's made. The one issue I might mention is the screw is a little stiff and hard to pull out, that may loosen up over time with usage. If you are looking to purchase this as a tool for work, I would probably steer you in another direction. There are lighter, easier to manipulate corkscrews than this one. They may not be as well constructed or look as nice as this one, but at work I prefer function over form."
2,Disappointing,I have many fine and some disappointing WMF bar tools. This one is poorly conceptualized and executed. The knife/foil cutter as someone wrote prior is uselessly dangerous. The rest is standard fare and too weighty.
5,Great product,"Very, very solid product that works perfectly. I can understand how this could be too heavy to lug around if you are a waiter, but for home use it is excellent. Ordering a second one for our bar."
4,new innovations,"This is a new innovation in world music, so far its the best music I have ever listened to in the class of world music. Everyone in every part of the world can basically relate to this music which I believe will capture a very wide audiences in all corners of the world. You will not regret having this CD added to your collections and I bet you will play it endlessly"
1,less than a one-star deserved,"i tuned into this movie about an hour into the film. stephen baldwin is in a hospital bad. his poorly made-up face looks fat and bloated. i couldn't believe the poor camera angle which exacerbated the size of his neck and lack of chin.but it was the toy helicopter (with real chopper noises) landing on plastic grass that had me howling out loud. and then the model radio telescope arrays. i suppose if they couldn't afford a real helicopter they really couldn't afford to go on a real location.this is one of the funniest film snippets i have ever seen. and it isn't even a comedy. make it into black and white, and it would look as if it was made in the 50s. except for baldwin's long hair style. i am not going to make it to the end, unfortunately. gee, i wonder what happens next."
2,Dark Storm,OK - I knew when I placed the order that it would not be a great movie but come on people.......this is more of a comedy! I got some great laughs from the story and the acting both!!!!
3,Low budget but entertaining,"I must admit that I purchased this from Amazon because of the enticing cover and the promise of seeing Maria Ford do something more than bad acting. Unfortunately, I was disappointed as her character is very flat and teasing without really getting there.The movie itself was decently written and has a semi-original storyline. Special effect are, as was to be expected, on the low-end of technology but there is quite a lot of running and quite a lot of blood. For a sci-fi horror fan, this movie rates just high enough to be in the collection."
3,Alien Terminator,This movie was OK to watch. I was hoping it would be better than it was. I would recommend this movie but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it.
3,Stunning.,"Where this delightful work of art came from I can't say, but what I can is that this book has changed the way I consider life around me, let alone my television. We really are all pawns in a sinister game of Intergalactic-satanic-extraterrestrial-supernatural chess. This book, and many others like it, is truth, despite it's obvious, numerous flaws and clear violations of reason. Take off the blinders! No, better yet, put new ones on! Where will you be Dec. 31, 1999??!?!?"
1,Interesting,"Mr. Christopher seems to have a very interesting take of the whole UFO phenomenon. It is within reason to say that a lawsuit from such Hollywood bigwigs as Chris Carter might be soon to follow, seeing how the conclusions reached in this book could give away the plot for the upcoming season of the X-Files. The citations from at best dubious sources and circumstantial evidence leads this reader to wonder what the author has been researching for 25 years. The anecdote that elicited the most laughter from my colleagues and I was the worldwide mental message sent at 6:00 PM, which was immediately ""answered"" by aliens. I'm actually broadcasting a mental message right now about the ""truth"" this book is trying to spread. It was good for laughs, like a schmaltzy 60s sci-fi movie, complete with denizens of the Mystery Science Theater commentating."
2,Want to know how X-Files ends? Read this book!,"This book receives an extra star for entertainment value -- I couldn't stop laughing. The content is presented as legitimate, intelligent science and theology, but it achieves neither. I feel sorry that this individual has spent so much time of his life researching this topic for naught -- there are much better ways to use paper. By the way, I didn't spend my money on this book -- I just happened across it.Yeah, the truth is out there -- but keep looking."
2,Stay away from it,I had both versions with and without speed booster. And both of them were working very unreliably. Slow transfer speeds and constant disconnects. I've to unplug it from USB port every 5-10 hours in order to reconnect. I already got rid of linksys router WRT54G (tried the new one SRX and it was a disaster) and moving to Belkin camp. I've had a Belkin Pre-N router for about a month and very happy with it.
2,can't find res_dll problem.,"Sure it's problem of there software whatever they telling us. If you tired of this message and want to run linksys's Wireless Network Monitor you should download driver for this device from Linksys cite, unzip it (run exe file), find Wlan.ini in directory C:\Linksys Driver\WUSB54GS_09012004 and add in the end of it:[GemtekLoadResDLL]LangResID=1ResFile=""resWusb54GS_US.dll""Then run setup from the same dir to install new driver with correct settings for res_dll (do not forget to uninstall existing version of driver)."
5,I'm satisfied with my purchase...,"Just a quick positive review so people can get a fair view. I bough this product a few days ago and have been saving the receipt like a 100 dollar bill. Today I decided to file it. The product has been working GREAT. I have a Microsoft router in my laptop and connected my mother's 10 year old Acer computer through the Linksys USB adapter. Although it says it works better with 2.0 USB's (which are faster) my mom's pc has the 1.0 and she still gets good connections (up tp 56kbs) It is also super easy to set up. My mom, who isn't that pc saavy, already leraned to use the security feautures. All in all, considering how well it has worked I'm giving the product 5 stars."
1,Just doesn't work with some PCs,"I tried to get this adapter working with my WinXP box and no luck. I upgraded the drivers, tried various configurations, read online advice, and it would still drop the wireless connection after about a minute. Then I tried a D-Link DWL-G122 on the same PC and bingo, up and running in no time and no problems so far. Linksys may make pretty good routers, but this device is just plain clunky and has serious design issues."
1,Linksys WUSB54GS is NOT Comapatible with WinVista 64-bit,"The WUSB54GS description on Amazon does NOT indicate which OS the wireless bridge works with. Only AFTER I received it, did I notice the carton indicates that it would NOT work with Vista Home Premium 64-bit. I confirmed this with a Linksys technician. He suggested, and I bought, the Linksys WUSB600N which costs more, but works fine."
1,computer,This item did not work on my computer although the advertising stated it would. A waste of time and money.
4,Lindsys USB Network Adapter - Happy Camper,"Couldn't pick up signal from the Linksys WRT54GS router in an adjacent room through a doorway (not line - of - sight) with a Linksys PCI card in a desktop or a built-in laptop adaptor card. Purchased the Linksys WUSB54GS adaptor. Had to move it about to find a ""sweet spot"" and it's been working great ever since"
2,Low Range,"I left behind my D-link DWL 132 (108 mbps) when I was on vocation which work great for me over a year. After read all the reviews, I decided to give this one (WUSB54GS a try). The signal range was dispointed (D-Link DWL132 have much better range). Setup with push button with Linksys Secure Easy Setup is easy with Linksys router, BUT I lost connection on my other Laptop PC which is not Linksys wireless adapter. I go back to re-setup my laptop than this adapter on desk top lost connection because of changing setting on the linksys router. One way or another, I spend 4 hours still unable to make both adapters work with Linksys 54g router."
1,Can't load Res_dll,"When you install the software that comes with this adapter on a windows system, an error message will pop up and stay up saying: Can't load Res_dll. I called Linksys customer service (they answered from the Philippines), who said that it is not a linksys problem, but a windows problem. When you go to Microfot's web site, a single page related to the error message comes up, but has zero help value.The adapter will work, but a small error message will stay on your desktop all the time. If you close it, it will pop up again in exactly 10 seconds, and will stay there.Hopefully Linksys and Cisco will take care of this problem before Christmas 2006."
3,"fast, and functioning.","yes it is fast, but it came with no CD, no program. what is someone supposed to do without the driver CD? how can they update if they only have access to wireless? epic fail."
4,"Wonderful Music, But Some Technical Difficulties","After hearing an interview with JoAnne Falletta with brief exerpts from this CD on NPR last Sunday, I ran right out and bought it. Converse composed lush, romantic, Wagnerian/Straussian music in the early 20th Century U.S., and if you like that type of music, (and I do!), this is a real feast. Although the music is thoroughly grounded in Europe, it also clearly breathes American air. And the homages to Strauss, and more strikingly, Wagner, are often quite surprizing, even revelatory. Perhaps more importantly, unlike say, Szymanowski or Scriabin, Converse avoided slavish imitation. At a slight distance, the sound is gorgeous, but close up on the headphones there are frequent, irritating noises. Perhaps the recording was miked very closely and picked up a lot of the page-turning, or maybe my disc has a manufacturing defect. In any case though, this music is well worth hearing and having."
4,ON Second Thought!.... Get It !,"Kinda funny thing happened to me. I wrote the below review also that states ""Pass on this one"". Then I took the cd home and listened to it again at home instead of at work. I really enjoyed the cd second time around. It is a bit more ""jazzy"" than their other cd, but there is plenty to keep ones interest. Overall, I am in fact happy I have this cd. I think I'll listen to cds more than once before reviewing them!"
4,a nice psychological thriller,"First and foremost, the cover of the dvd does not tally at all with this film's theme. This is not a horror tale like ""The Grudge"" but rather, a psychological thriller with a romantic twist. It is nice to see Lee Pace in a different light, away from the ""Pushing Daisies"" persona. Sarah Michelle Gellar also did a tremendous job in this little known flick.The plot is good and it is rare to find a film which deals with this kind of story. Buy!"
3,OKAY THRILLER,"Michelle Geller (Jess) has a great life with her neglected husband, Ryan. He is kind considerate etc. etc. Living with the couple is his brother Roman, who beats women and is out of jail on parole. He gives Jess the creeps. Roman confides to his girlfriend, who he slaps around, that if he could live his life over, he would do it as somebody else....Then accident happens. While going across a foggy bridge in opposite directions, the two brothers have a head on collision and both end up in a coma (this was the hard part to believe). Roman comes out of the coma and claims he is Ryan, knowing things that only Ryan would know. Now Roman goes from creepy to Twilight Zone eerie as Jess has to decide if he is the real deal or just playing as the movie shows the two brothers laid out on the bridge, their blood mixing while they are getting zapped. The acting was good, the plot execution was okay. Didn't we see this movie before?"
1,What' s wrong?,"Gosh! Since that awful adaptation from the Japanese classic, Sarah Mcihelle Gellar acts all of her roles with the same distant, faceless look. It's weird.This one is another flop, lazily executed, excrucitingly low. Well, maybe for a TV moive it would be enough."
