2,not what you'd expect,"Do not buy this book if you are are web developer and want ideas.This is NOT a book about website design, it is about art.In fact, most of the sites in this book are truly horribleweb designs. There is a lot of crappy and downright weirdabstract art that happens to be on websites somewhere.If you actually visit many of the sites in the book, you can barely navigate them. They are full of broken links and some sites are completely gone. As a web designer, I was completely disappointed with this book. In fact, I'd say these are perfect examples of how NOT to do a website. The author asks every site owner the same questions: ""What are your favorite sites?"", ""If you were President of the WWW, what would you change?"", etc. It's like it came from a high-school newspaper.Now if you want a good coffee table book, this is it. It has lots of pictures. The hybrid softish/hardish cover is nice. It is interesting to look at."
2,French disguised as British,"The movie may be worth more than 2 stars, but this is a generous rating for the DVD. The sound is distorted and fuzzy. All dialog is dubbed in the continental fashion of the time. It was very difficult to tell what was being said, however much of the humor was visual. Alas, the picture has been haphazardly cropped to full screen and some significant action cannot be seen, in addition to closing titles running off screen. Colors are quite drab. You never know what quality to expect from a Wham!USA disc - I have some British comedies that are near perfect in picture and sound, and others suffer the same fate as this. All this took away from my enjoyment of the movie itself. I might have a more favorable experience with a restored widescreen transfer with cleaned up sound. Then again, the music felt much more French than British. I guess I'm just spoiled by Carry On series and the Doctor movies."
4,The Counterfeit Constable-British Slapstick,"If you like the dry, British sense of humor, you will enjoy this film. There are some especially funny moments in the first 20 minutes. Mark Lester made his first film appearance in The Counterfeit Constable, and appears periodically throughout the story as part of a sort of running gag. He was 2 1/2 at the time. There are several foot chases and close calls, reminiscent of Benny Hill. This is an entertaining movie, full of broad, slapstick humor. There is very mild sexual content, no objectionable language, and no violence. The Counterfeit Constable is completely suitable for family viewing."
2,Inaccurate track listings.,"Don't waste your money, if like me, you value accurate & reliable liner notes.I was excited to find a recording of opera ensembles - they're hard to find, and it is fine that they are archival recordings as opposed to contemporary recordings.I quickly realized that the liner notes' listing of tracks was inaccurate; while I love opera I do not know every aria and the opera from which it comes; so having accurate liner notes/listings is important to me. Fortunately, I know enough that I knew that what I was listening to was not what the notes said. Months ago, I emailed the company that put out the CD, requested an accurate list of tracks, and have receive no response of any kind. If you're an expert and recognize every ensemble, then this will be ok; but if you're like me, and value accuracy, don't give these people your money."
5,We need it,"This is really the only full-length book on DPT ever made. There are a handfull of short articles, but this is the real deal. I have read some excerpts of it and it looks good. Bill Richards' short articles on the subject are very high quality as well. It's hard to find this book (I've been looking for years), so I hope someone at Amazon sees this and gets some copies!"
4,Surprize,"I saw this DVD at the local Walmart and decided that it would make a nice addition to my library. I went home, researched it on line and found it at a cheaper price. I ordered it and when it came in found that it was the same one that was displayed at Walmart. My only critism was that it advertised the products they sell at the store, such as the family using the milk, cereal , etc. that they sell there."
5,"Rachel beautifully captures life in ""Earth Lessons""","In just a little more than 70 pages, Rachel Dacus takes me from smiles and chuckles to tears and ponderings of life on earth. The images are rich with color and fragrance. My very favorite(today) is ""Why I Like Weather"". Starting out with: ""Famous for always being there..."" this poem takes me through mystical clouds, practical prognostications and ending with warm assurance that change, in weather as in life, is inevetable and this is good. I recommend this little gem to anyone who loves nature and finds themselves pondering life."
3,"Interesting, though flawed, debut","Rachel Dacus, Earth Lessons (Bellowing Ark Press, 1998)Interesting debut collection from Dacus (Femme au Chapeau), presaging things to come but still feeling rather rough and unformed; one of those ""the development of a fine poet"" books that requires a bit of patience and a familiarity with the poet's larger body of work. Not to say there's not some pretty fine stuff to be found here, of course:""At Yellowstone they let the wildfires burn.One kind of pine can only propagatewith a blaze, exploding pineconesscattering cracked seedsinto carbon-enriched soil...""(""Let the Wildfires Burn"")The book is somewhat steadfast in its refusal to let the reader draw his own conclusions (in fact, the end of that very poem is ""...if there is no other way out/of this age of too much known and seen/then let the wildfires rage.""), but Dacus on her game, simply describing and not editorializing, is a very good thing indeed, and well worth checking out. **"
1,Reads like a class paper,"I should have listened to the other reviewers before purchasing this book. The information in the book is gleaned from other notable writers of the Civil War, and doesn't provide any new information, only rather a synopsis from those other writings on the same subject - even the photographs used are from those other books. This reads like a class assignment about the Civil War, something with which I am well familiar as I am pursuing an M.A. in History. Stick with the noted authors like McPherson, Faust, etc., for this type of information."
1,pretty much awful,"I usually don't write reviews, good or bad, because I'm a lazy man, but this here takes the cake. doesn't really work as it should: half the time you can't connect to the internet anymore, the other half the computer's frozen. now I'm fairly comfortable with computers, did my share of tweaking and configuring, but ghostsurf's just not playing nice. tried contacting customer service four times, but it's like shouting at a deaf man: no response. not even a ""thanks for your e-mail, but we'll politely not do anything about it"". nothing. just plain infuriating. hope this here gets through. crossing my fingers."
1,A Waste of Money,"If you have no idea. If you have never read widely or if you are fairly unaware of man's inhumanity to man as applied by the great arbiter of justice: the law, then this is the book for you.However, if you are reasonably well read, or have some idea of the creativity man wastes on causing pain to his fellow man, then it is a total waste of money. I bought it as my first book on a subject that I know little about and yet found nothing new and some incorrect and if i wanted to look at pictures I could have looked up El Jazeer.Perhaps the ""Golden Book of the History of Judicial Murder"" might be a better title.I was and am quite disappointed."
3,Not Quite Deep Enough,"Actually this book is a skim over things you already know. Not a complete waste of time, but I am certain there are more comprehensive texts available."
1,The History of Torture and Execution,"I have not yet received the book ordered even though, I paid a rather high price for it. I have been unable to get a response from the seller, and am beginning to think that they may be something ""less than reputable"".James J. EbyRATING- ""ZERO STARS""!"
4,economical meter that does a lot,"This meter works well. I had one just like it but with out the name tag. It got ran over and now I have this one at half the price of the tool guy. The only problem I have with this meter is I need to check Hz on diesel powered generators. This meter ""freaks out"" for some reason,it works fine checking Hz from a power outlet on the wall but won't do it on the generator powered equipment. Still a great meter for the price."
3,Shorted by 33%,"There were only 2 in the package rather than 3. No big deal, but I would have thought counting to 3 would not be an issue."
2,OK for a reference book. Not a good first book on the Slav.,"I been playing the Slav for a couple of years and have worked through Matthew Sadler's excellent book. I purchased this book to continue my studies. I find that it is not well laid out. Actually, if you are trying to learn to play the Slav, the introduction is the best part of the book. I have been able to pick through and study-up on the lines I try to play, but this is more of a reference book, not a text book on the Slav. If you are trying to learn the opening, buy Sadler's book. If you already know what you are doing and just want to go deeper into some variations, (notably the exchange variation and the ...a6 Slav) then you might get some use out of the book. Otherwise, your money is better spent elsewhere."
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"I have to concur with the 2 other reviews here that indicate that this is a reference book and not an instruction book. For a high-rated player already well grounded in the fundementals, and who is looking for esoteric variations, this may be a fine resource. For a learner or intermediate player it can be overwhelming because of the endless variations. None of these variations seem to go past about 12 or 13 moves, and no complete games are given. Other than the 6 pages of introduction, verbal comments are very brief throughout the book. I hate to say ""data dump"", but for a lower rated player that's what it will seem like.For learning the Slav system I recommend the books by Sadler, Vigus, and Lakdawala."
5,C.O.C. Rocks... Live!,"If you're a fan of COC or any old school hard rock for that matter, then you need this. Live versions of ""Clean My Wounds"" and ""Albatross"" sound just as good, if not better than the originals. And for such songs as ""Senor Limpio"" and ""Wiseblood,"" the live setting allows for maximum groove and chunk to be added; substantially improving their sound. The production here is a perfect example of less=more as you are allowed to hear every instrument as well as frontman Pepper Keenan's menacing growls without sugar coating. This album shows that, even deep into their career, that COC still tear up the stage on their own terms."
1,total letdown,"Do not be fooled by this item. It is NOT the concert dvd, but is instead a strange cd that plays on your dvd player called ""dvd audio"". Contains 1 video only. Total bummer when it arrived. Useless unless you don't have the live cd and like using your dvd player to listen to cds."
1,THIS WAS A PURE D RIPOFFFFFFF!,"THIS SAYS MUSIC DVD , BUT ALL IT IS , ARE PICTURES OF DIFFERENT BAND MEMBERS ON THE SCREEN WHILE LIVE MUSIC PLAYS BEHIND THE PICS. DO NOT BUY !!!"
3,"It is an interesting book, but it drags after a while.","I basically enjoyed the story of this book, and I would recommend it. In Michael Medved's own words, it tells the important story of his own intellectual, spiritual, philosopical, and political journey from secular Jew, left-wing activist to a devoutly religious Jew and conservative thinker. It reflects one of the important threads in the fabric of the United States of America. It is well worth hearing his testamony. Nevertheless, I thought that the book bogged down in places, and for me at least got a little tedious."
5,Interesting Bio and More!,"I got more than I bargained for with Medved's book. I expected the life lessons, but the autobiographical aspect of his book was very interesting. I loved the details of his life which were very engrossing and loved hearing about how he went from ordinary person to accomplished observer of politics, movies, world issues and pop culture. Very enjoyable book!"
4,"Love the Guy, Don't Always Love the Message","Michael Medved is a religious (orthodox) Jew. His message is often too religious and right-wing political for my taste. Yet the man has integrity, candor, character and incredible moral values. We could all do much worse than to listen to that kind of man. If only America would put more integrity, candor, charachter and moral values into our government, classrooms and politics- we'd all be better off for it. Solid book, easy reading, great man as author."
4,An amazing jewish republican transformation,"Right Turns: From Liberal Activist to Conservative Champion in 35 Unconventional LessonsWhat an amazing life story. What I found so profound, was my own life experiences, in going from a jewish democrat to jewish conservative republican.I found his life story quite compelling, and inspiring, to help me find my own jewish identity.Sadly, being a republican is highly discouraged as a jew. It's rather sad, there are no local places in Minnesota, where you can pray, and not have to worry about being silent, rather than being a part of a good community.Thank you, Michael Medved, for such an inspiring and heart-warming autobiography."
1,just another JEW OPPORTUNIST trying to cash in,"Medved is just another JEW OPPORTUNIST who gave up movie reviews because he sees dollar signs in exploiting the giant population of simpleton morons in this country who call themselves ""Conservatives"" (yet are actually hypocritical confused idiots who don't believe in conserving of any sort). These gullible idiots love to latch onto anyone who talks like a ""smart guy"" (they can't really tell because they have no brains).What Medved doesn't realize is that ""Conservatives"" are illiterates who never read anything and just rely on cult talk show hosts and their idiot friends (and of course Fox Fake News) for all their false knowledge."
2,Mixed Feelings About This Guy,"I enjoy his radio show. I agree with much of what he says. Yet, it all doesn't seem to jibe. You often do get the feeling that he is an oppurtunist.Also, a question:How can someone call him/herself a ""cultural crusader"" and build a radio show around politics and ""culture"" when he/she doesn't own a TV set? Whether we like it or not television has become one of the most powerful influences on Western culture. How is one going to comment on cable news, reality shows, risque comedy/dramas, the pull of MTV, BET, etc. on youth fashion, speech and morality if one never watches any of it?"
5,Prescription for Hope and Optimism,"While pessimism and victimhood permeate our diverse society (cultivated by mainstream media), Right Turns serves as a prescription for hope and optimism. Michael Medved is a true American whose deep appreciation and love for our country is contageous. The lessons learned in RT are invaluable for audiences of any background or persuasion. A real page-turner leaving the reader wanting more."
2,A Disappointment,"I couldn't finish this book and I'm not sure if the problem is in the writing or in the editing. At times the author seems to take these great leaps based on one or two anecdotes from his life and it is just not convincing. There are some interesting details here and there but for me, it was just too rambling and all over the map."
5,Beautiful watch,This is a beautiful watch. I was so pleased when I opened the box. It adds just the right amount of elegance to a dressy outfit but can easily switch to casual wear.
2,"Amateur sleuth, Academic setting","As a long-time Barbara Pym fan, I was curious about Hazel Holt's mysteries. I had previously read her biography of Pym who was her colleague and friend. So, perhaps it was not fair of me to expect or hope for Pymean wit in the work of Ms. Holt. Certainly I found little of it. The main character, Sheila Mallory is a likeable, if dim, amateur sleuth of the bumbling variety. Her various stabs at a solution to the murder of an assistant employed by the Bodlean Library are pathetic. Ultimately, the mystery is easy to solve simply because the list of suspects is so small. The book would be pleasant enough given its Oxford setting, but was ruined for me by the depiction of homosexuals. They are shown as scheming and cruel. (Saying more about their motivations would constitute a spoiler.) Strangely, a novel that seems intended as a pleasant read ends up as a mean-spirited exercise in cliched characters."
5,Great moments fom Wagner Operas,"Musical quality is excellent considering the age of some of the recordings and the singers are top notch Wagnerian interpreters of their eras. A very good CD collection for those unfamiliar with Wagner operas in general, particular Wagner operas or great Wagnerian singers of the past."
2,BEWARE: Won't Fit Minivans or Compact SUV's,"I was very impressed by the design and materials of this tire-stepper. Unfortunately, the manufacturer does not tell you that it will not fit onto tires where the vehicle's wheel well design leaves little room around the tire. This means that my Honda Odyssey minivan and compact SUV Subaru Forester did not come close in allowing this stepper to fit. Yes, I could return it easily thanks to Amazon's fine customer policies, but I wish the manufacturer was much clearer in its representations about the specific vehicles their product would fit."
4,Won't fit 2010 Highlander Limited,I was really looking forward to using this product when washing the vehicle and loading the roof top carrier. Unfortunately it won't work on a Highlander Limited. The metal bar that sits across the back of the tire will not fit between the tire and the coil spring housing. Bummer.Apart from that little problem the product is well designed and of high quality. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it if it will fit your vehicle.
3,On my 2nd unit,"I received the 1st one, defective from the factory. It was welded wrong, the connecting tubes were not straight when the weld was placed. Poor quality control. I knew it was made in China so I was not surprised. Placed a call to Amazon for a return ticket, as always no problems there. I asked for a replace to be sent, again no problems. I received the 2nd that was also defective. This one was defective the same way but to a much lesser degree. For the price I figured I'd make due.It will hold me (225lbs) with little effort. I'm hoping it will hold me with the weight of my canoe. Thats the reason I purchased it. My truck is tall and I needed a lift/step to load the canoe on to the Yakima racks.If or when it fails, I'll do a follow up review."
3,just say'n,"This item will not work on my 2011 F-450 4x4, because it hits the front hubcap. I haven't tried it on my Dodge 1500 4x4. But really needed it for my Ford I'll get back to you after I try it on the Dodge. Mike"
3,fits the need BUT....,"The product works BUT the bag does not close after extending the arm. Need a bigger bag to handle the whole enchalada. What a shame the manufacturer can't figure this out, very obvious."
5,Hitchmate Tire Step,"One of the best things for working on my truck I ever bought.Beats the hell out of standing on the tire or using a stool or chair which tend to kick out leaving you hanging rather uncomfortably on a front fender. If you have a truck with any kind of lift, you need one of these. Already bought a second one so I don't have to keep moving it from side to side."
3,Great for full size truck,"I bought this to get up on the roof of my VW Vanagon to a after market rack.It gave me very little step up and didn't really work as the tire was too small to begin with.I ended up buying a telescopic ladder here at Amazon, those are awesome but spendy.It does allow me to work on my engine on my Chevy 1-ton truck.I would not recommend this item to a friend."
2,Cumbersome,"I wanted to like this tire step. I have an 2000 Xterra, and this tire step fits in the wheel wells with no problem. It is rugged and heavy duty in looks and in feel. But it just felt very cumbersome to me. Adjusting the height on this was a chore... the fit of the screws is very tight and frustrating even though I knew I would have to adjust it once and leave it at that. But the step, when folded, just seemed really awkward. It will swing open (either the step part or the part that wraps around the tire) if you don't hold it just right, as someone else commented... watch your fingers when that happens! I tightened the screws so the step would not open so freely but then found that it was just tight enough that the step did not fold flat symmetrically if tightened just so. Also, once you adjust the height the step no longer fits in the bag. I decided to return the tire step and instead picked up a folding hi-step stool that can actually gets me up higher than the tire step could."
2,Heininger HitchMate TireStep,"I was initially excited to receive and use my Heininger HitchMate TireStep, on my 2010 Honda Pilot, only to be disappointed in the end. The TireStep was increasingly difficult to use. It would not fit over the tire very easily which became very frustrating. It was difficult to take off once it was on which was even more maddening. I adjusted the step to the highest level to pack my Thule cartop carrier but it was still not high enough to get above the rack. Of course the TireStep will not fit in the carrying case after you adjust the height of the step. You have to disassemble it to fit in the carrying case. Decided not to bring it on the trip because it was such a pain to use. Instead of facilitating my packing experience, the TireStep hindered it. Definitely know the size of your tires and wheel well opening before you purchase this item."
1,Don't Waste Your Time...,"Jane Ellen Wayne's book is, at best, a gossipy introduction to Robert Taylor. Although it seems so real because she provides information from Taylor and many of his cohorts, some of her claims and reportings are false and she occasionally contradicted herself. This book disgraces Taylor, makes him look like a womanizing momma's boy who preyed on his young collegeues, it did not flow in any chronological order that would often confuse the reader, and has no historical merit. She includes, very minimal (and I mean very minimal) documentation of actual sources--only 13 footnotes. Also, she doesn't provide a bibliography. Although these things are not always a ""deal-breaker"", they are in this case. A biography is intended to tell the story of the person in some coherent, chronological manner--this one doesn't. You can't trust her claims that seemed accurate as she hasn't any trustworthy research. Don't waste your money or time."
2,Robert Taylor,The book is writen in a magazine article manner. Makes Barbara Stanwyck out to be a mean terrible person and RT out to be a little boy that needs a mommy figure (which is what he didn't oant to look like). This book is a good start but I hope someone writes a better one. Ms. Wayne could have done better. I like some of he onther books.
4,A Good Purchase,"The book was most certainly worth the money. As a newcomer to the world of poultry keeping, it was both easy to read and well laid out for easy reference, detailing everything you could need to know on a husbandry level.A definite for anyone thinking of taking on the challenge of chicken keeping!!!"
1,This book is worse than useless.,"The recommendations in this book make it a waste of time, especially the nesting box design.Save your time and money and befriend someone who has healthy chickens. Learn from them.These men are not as well informed as they think they are.Frustrating."
1,Not what I'd hoped,"I wish I had looked through this book a bit more before buying it. While it has some useful information, it isn't outlined well at all and should be edited. The author seems overly focused upon himself through stories and lots of useless information that tends to be over-explained in a way that reveals some arrogance, in my opinion. It's as though he wrote the book for himself instead of providing a concise guide for those wanting to learn about chickens. If you want straightforward information about raising chickens, I would not recommend this book."
3,nice pictures,"This book has lots of nice pictures, but the information can very easily be obtained from the internet at no cost. not recommended"
4,Informative book,I am very satisfied with the book. I have just started a small flock of chickens....and the info in the book was very helpful.
4,"No new info, but great pictures","The information in this book isn't unique; websites and other books cover all the same topics, often in more detail. The pictures are priceless, though. My wife was ambivalent at best toward my dreams of backyard chickens, until I showed her the pictures of cute little baby chicks in this book. Now she is on board. I probably will not use this book as my main reference, because the Storey guide is so much more informative. But the pictures will serve to introduce kids and skeptics to the idea of chickens in the backyard, so I will keep it for that purpose."
2,Trite,"What a lot of unbelievable nonsense! Georgiana wants to marry her chosen man - of whom her parents disapprove, so naturally she decides to pretend to have fallen in love with the disreputable Earl of Dunraven. Not too incredible so far, when we bear in mind that Georgiana is barely out of the schoolroom and therefore pretty silly and naive. But Summerville expects us to believe that someone of Dunraven's age and standing would go along with it?The remainder of the book contains cliched plot device after cliched plot device, and the most unbelievable element of the entire book is the romance between Georgiana and Dunraven. What someone like him could see in a spoilt, silly child I have absolutely no idea.Basically, read something else."
3,"Worthwhile for the rookie, but you'll quickly move past it if you take an interest.","Bought this book at the recommendation of a couple of Sci-Fi's ""Ghost Hunters"" crew. It is indeed a good starter book, but if you take more than a casual interest in ghost hunting, you will quickly outgrow it. The book lacks more of the technical detail a lot of people are seeking, which is probably not the fault of the author, per se...it is an ""Idiot's"" guide, after all.It's cheap enough and worth the money to add it to your library, especially for casual paranormal enthusiasts."
4,Neat book for beginners with wonderful References for those intrested in actually investigating w/professionals,"The Best part of this book are the references the author gives of professionals who actually Do this work on a daily basis. Take the contact information for example of Psychic-Medium and Parapsychological Investigator: Michael J. Kouri who has appeared on more International Television and Radio Shows than any other Real Psychic-Medium in the United States, today. It gives his website and contact information on how to actually work with someone as Legitimate an Investigator & to me, That is really cool! Some of the chapters could have included technical equipment, however the Medium is the real tool for any Paranormal Investigation.The information inside is ""very"" basic, but could be helpful to those interested in the Investigation Field of Parapsychology or the Armchair Ghost Hunter."
5,we use it often,I too expected an under-representation in this book but have found it very useful in refining our use of terms and expressions. At Metrolina Paranormal Research Labs we use this text as an intro for new field investigators. At the very least it gets us all speaking from the same dictionary - it is also very entertaining.
2,Unfortunately will not make idiots any wiser,"I have to say I was surprised at all the factual errors in this book. I know there are no ""facts"" in paranormal investigations, but this book gets actual ""facts"" wrong when discussing people and places. Queen Elizabeth I is not buried at Windsor Castle; she's entombed at Westminster Abbey. This is just one small example of MANY inaccuracies found in this book."
1,For once a book that lives up to its name,"I was very disappointed with this book. I am a ghosthunter by profession and bought this book out of curiosity. It is full of misconceptions anf false information. For anyone looking for serious information on the spirits and ghosts around us, I would not recommend this book. For those looking for some fun reading around the campfire this book is better suited for this purpose. For once I can say that a book lives up to its name....the author should research a little more........"
1,Don't bother,"This is probably one of the worst ghost books I have ever read. Perhaps it is trying to live up to it's title, since it assumes the reader does not know any definition for ghosts or hauntings or anything in between and chooses to act as if this book will give you all the answers. It doesn't give any. Most of the book is spent on small snippets of useless information in an effort to ""tell you alot"". If you want to read a real ghost book, go pick out anything by Hans Holzer, or perhaps ""Gravesend"",or ""Haunted Heartland"" or ANY other book on ghosts and hauntings but this one."
2,Intellectuals beware,"This is the first book I've purchased on ghosts and hauntings. I have lukewarm feelings on this book. I don't like it because it is very poorly edited, never goes into detail, and adds florish where there should be none (like serving a McDonalds burger with parsley tucked in the side). I like the book because it touches on many arenas of ghosts and gives me a better idea of what I want in the next hauntings book I order. Also, the short segments make it a perfect book to tuck next to the toilet. It's easy to put down after one or two short sections so you never wind up with sleeping buttocks."
1,Filled with errors,"Please do not waste your money on this book. Even if you just borrow it or check it out of the library, don't expect to get a lot out of it. It is filled with errors.There is very, very little in the paranormal field that is ""fact"". You may be wondering how I can say this book is filled with errors. Ogden messes up stuff that is fact... the number of siblings John Wesley had, information about the University of Alabama, and more. This is a sloppily assembled book. Even basic information is incorrect. So, how on earth are we supposed to trust his writing about the less concrete things?Also, whoever proofread and editted this book should be fired. There are grammatical, spelling, and printing errors, erroneous captions and labels, and more.It's a shoddy piece of work....poor quality control. If they ever release a reprint, they've got a ton of work to do."
2,Depends on........,"I ordered this book because a college Pal called me and said he was featured in this book so I ordered it. It is a good book if you do not reserch what is real and not real. For me, I think it is fluff, stupid and insulting to people that have an I.Q. over 2."
4,Spring's Awakening,"I admit I was intrigued to read this play both because I am going to see the musical adaptation in New York and because of the controversy surrounding the content for over a hundred years. The numerous forwards are tough to slog through at times but the play itself is a great read and really captures the angst of youth. Read in 1890 or 2007, this play is relevant to all of us who remember the strange and scary trip that was or is puberty."
2,A Rather Dated Work,"I bought this title after hearing all the buzz about the current Broadway musical of the same name inspired by this original. I personally found it dated, full of the cliches of late Imperial German culture and its outlook: histrionic, melodramatic and just plain corny. Perhaps readers more sympathetic to or in-tune with that epoch and its values might find this a moving or interesting read. What I got from it, though was a clearer idea of why the post-World War I Weimar Republic's avante-garde couldn't wait to sweep away the cultural system that produced this kind of stuff."
5,Probably one of the best album of the decade!,"No other album can come close to this!It got all the ingredientsfor spring,summer, autumn and winter. No matter how often you listen to this cd, the music sound better and fresher compared to those one hit wonders outthere.Perfect chill-out evening n travelling :)"
1,Bad Buy,"I bought this ring flash, and it was absolutely below my expectations. I have other Vivitar equipment, however this does not match it. It is not worth the buy. The flash is made of cheap plastic, and it messes up the photo. The flash creates a fog in the image, and other times at the bottom of the image turns out black... a flash is supposed to emit light to brighten the photo not cloud or black it out. I am returning the product."
3,not for oily hair,"Nexxus makes great products and I lobve diametress...great volume for fine hair. This is not for volume or fine hair, difinitely not for oily hair. I would think it would be perfect for dry or damaged hair though"
1,SLS...,"I used Nexxus some 20 years ago which used to be good. Nexxus is awful. Sold with huge discount at Costco, I got this Nexxus Therappe which dried my hair. Ingredients are sodium laureth sulfate which is used in paints... these days everyone stays away from SLS but not Nexxus."
1,Don't waste your money,"As stated by a previous poster, the positive reviews on here were before the many changes to their formula. The new formulas are cheap and work no better than your store brand ones, so why waste your money on it? I am extremely disappointed and will never purchase this product."
4,"Excellent , but oily","I am an avid hair product buyer. I have pretty damaged hair, and have tried and used (for months) over 6 different kinds of high end shampoo. This is one of them that left my hair feeling soft, flowy, shiny and amazing. My ends were frayed and dry, and after use, it was soft again! The only bad thing about this shampoo is that it has a lot of oils in it. Hair is always bound to be super super oily by the end of the second day."
3,Changed product !,The current Therappe is not the same as it used to be. I noticed the bottle changed but didn't think about it. But after I used it several people said wow you're hair doesn't look the same. Sure enough the old bottle instructions didn't mention conditioner but the new bottle does ! So I went around looking for all the product in the old bottles.
5,Great stuff!!,"I have long, thick, wavy and color treated hair. I was introduced to this product years ago and strayed away from it to try other newer products. I still haven't found a shampoo or conditioner that makes my hair as smooth and manageable as nexus does. Its great for heavy thick hair like mine and doesn't strip your hair color either. I have lots of natural waves and instead of making your waves frizzy it makes them smooth and so pretty! Great product that's stayed around for years!"
5,Fantastic!,"This stuff is super! I thought I was using good shampoo before, but this stuff practically makes my hair SING! I have long, [untreated] naturally blond hair, so I need good shampoo. Some products make my hair look dark, or seem to strip the life right out of it. Not this stuff. I kid you not, if I wash it, use the Nexus Humectress Conditioner, towel dry it, then air dry it naturally, I see the most beautiful natural color and waves in it. I never saw my hair come out like that before. I LOVE this stuff. I should mention that I am NOT a spring chicken either, so I don't have that hair-like-a-baby the 25 year olds have in the television commercials."
3,"Great for Razor, a pain to setup for the Krazor (K1M)","Using this software for the razor works great. You are able to transfer pictures, videos, contacts, etc between PC and phone. Setting it up for the K1M is time consuming. You would need to download a development driver from Motorola and specify a different type of phone (I think V3M was what I used)"
1,Ringtone Editing not available for all model phones!!,"Ouch, what a bummer. I was hoping this software would be the answer my custom ring tone issues. I finally got the software working (which is indeed a pain but functional) with my MotoRazr V3m only to find that the MotoRazrV3m does not support the 'multimedia' feature of this software. So no custom ring tones for me.However it appears that it will back up your contacts and the other features it claims, if thats what your after, sure it works.If you have a MotoRazrV3m and are looking to make custom ring tones (that you can actually set as ringtone!) This software is not your answer.But all hope is not lost! You can hack your phone using 'P2kCommander'. This actually worked!! Google search ""Motorola Phone Tools can't transfer files"" and follow the tutorial step by step. Finally my frustration is eased, and Im rockin' Slayer when my homies call! You suck Motorola!"
3,"First package didn't work, received prompt replacement.",I received the product very quickly. The disc and cable did not work. I contacted A1 Accessories and they sent me another disc and cable that worked very quickly. A bit of a hassle. But good product.
2,only ok.,This product didn't do the things I wanted it too but I got it for so cheap that I'm not too mad. The program doesn't let me put ringtones on my phone like it said and also it duplicated my contact list so now I have 2 of all my saved phone numbers. Besides charing my phone and somewhat managing my contacts it dosen't do much else.
1,Motorola Razr v3,"It did not work for my phone. I Loaded the software to my laptop, and connected my phone the software, it did not connect to my phone."
2,can't say,"may work on other people's razr, but ours was fromt the first year of razrs and it didn't work at all."
1,Doesn't work with all Motorola Phones.,Should make sure that sellers know it doesn't work with all phones. I have the Entice W755 and your software doesn't work.
2,Didn't work until Update Installed,I tried unsuccessfully to use this product for the first couple of hours that I had it. I uninstalled a couple times. Finally I reinstalled and did an online update. After the update the product worked great and I was able to transfer data from my phone. As long as you update before trying to connect your phone it is a good deal.
3,Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 Software. Does the job,I have the Razr v3. I wanted to backup and edit phone numbers primarily. Being able swap music and picture files is a bonus. Charging the phone via USB is a bonus. The Date book functionality on the phone is weak so I am unable to use this part of the software utility to its fullest.Word of advice...Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 Software will call out for a software update for the computer......BUT it will not update the driver on the phone. You must right click the phone Icon (while the phone is pluged into the USB port) and do this yourself.
1,Not all models listed are REALLY supported.,"This product (version 4.0) works with my V3 and V3x. It does NOT work with my new V3e.I am using the overpriced Version 4.0 disc purchased directly from Motorola.Software updates still do not recognized the V3e. Not sure which models listed work and which don't, but the fact that non-supported models seem to be listed is sufficient to be skeptical and go elsewhere. Yeah, and it's a penny, PLUS a lot in shipping!So, if the software works for you, it is pretty nice. If not, you're out. I gave a review of one star based on the fact that a model I KNOW doesn't work is in the supported list."
4,Creating ringtones is easy,"I would give this a 5-star rating, but I had a little trouble installing the software.Now that it's on my computer, it's great and easy to use. It's easy to create your own ringtones and upload them to the phone. You can either use mp3 files that are on your computer, or grab a song from your favorite CD. Then slice and dice it, fade in and out, and yeah ... a new ringtone!This is also great for transfering photos to and from your phone. You can't go wrong with the price :)"
1,Motorola RAZR Data Cable & Software,"I wish that I had done some homework before purchasing. I received exactly what the listing said, but when I installed it, learned that the version of the software required for my brand-new RAZR was 4.21. I had a lot of trouble updating the software from the website. This would probably work fine with an older model RAZR, but I ended up tossing the program out of frustration. I'll next look for the most current version of the software. All of this was my ignorance and not the fault of the manufacturer or the seller."
1,Not Good With Razr V3xx,"Horrible experience in getting this device to connect w/ the V3xx. Had to do 7 updates and 1 uninstall. Took about 5 tel. calls w/ tech support (who were helpful, if not frustrated, like me!)."
1,not so good,I have tried it several times and it does not work on my Motorola RAZR. I wish I had not purchased it.
3,Great Price!,Works very good but little confusing with software install. Great price and fast delivery.
4,Motorola Razr,No problems with the cable - still in the learning stage. Received it quickly and with no problems.
4,Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 Software,"No problems installing on windows XP. During installation, the software went through three update cycles to get to the latest version of the software (5.x)."
4,Good. fast delivery,The price is right for this product. I bought an earlier version from Motorola a few years ago. It cost almost $50
1,Save Your Money,"I am not a computer geek, but I am not computer illiterate either. I purchased this product and my brother did as well. Neither one of us could get it to work. This is a copied CD which obviously did not have the up to date software on it for our Razr 3 phones.Save the $5 (including shipping) - I can't stress this enough - this is JUNK!!Oh... I gave it one star because I couldn't give it zero..."
1,They got me with this one! What can you expect for a penny?,It never detected my Razr V3a phone although it's clearly listed it as one of the phones that it would work with. I guess you truly get what you pay for. If you're keeping score it's: MOTOROLA 1- Customer 0.
2,Not what I expected,"With Verizon service and the Razr, you still can't upload/download pics and tunes without hacking the device. Wish it would've said that somewhere in the description."
3,Mostly OK,Had a little trouble installing the updates for the software to recognize my V3r.Multimedia editor limted on size of MP3 files it can import. wouldn't take files the size of my favorite music.Works OK for synchronizing contacts.
4,It works,"Although there is a bit of a problem when you get a phone call if conected to the pc, your USB stops working. Works fine to transfer files, edit tunes, wallpapers, contacts, sincronize to outlook, etcCheers!"
3,Motorola razr V3,The price was great! I do not find that the CD has the V3 phone on it unless I am doing something wrong so it was of no use to me.
4,Good product but it took way too long to get here,Good product. I paid extra for faster shipping and it took over two weeks to arrive.
3,Well......,"This product was just as described in the product description, the only thing that it failed to mention was that it appeared to be taken out of the box of another product. It was recieved in an envelope....inside the envelope was a plastic bag, about the size of a compact disc. Inside the plastic bag, was a cd, and the cable. Like I said, the item was as described, but it was taken out of another package."
5,Wish I'd Had This When My Razr Was New,"Well, better late than never. I wish I'd had this when my Razr was new. Makes it so easy to add contacts to the Motorola Razr phone and backup the phone's data to the computer. (You know how hard it is to type in a new contact with the Razr when one has to press a key several times just to get the letter desired.) Enter the data in the computer and transfer it to the Razr with the press of one computer key. Also allows your computer to connect to the internet by connecting your computer to the Razr with the included USB cable. It shows up on your computer as another wireless connection. Charge your phone using the computer, as well. If you still own a Razr, get this, you'll love it!!"
1,motorola phone tools,Did not install on an Acer PC running Vista. It seems to be a surplus edition for the chinese market.
1,UGH!!!!,"I bought this product for my Motorola Razr so I can put songs on my phone. The CD also had other stuff like transferring numbers to my computer, but I never use those applications. When I tried to transfer my songs to my phone it didn't work, but at least I got a USB cable and I was able to charge my phone with my computer. The price was cheap so I wasn't too worried about losing money."
2,No Longer Works On V3 RZR,"This item no longer works w/ the V3 RZR. The free online update tool only revises it up to v. 4.3. That still doesn't get it.i contacted the seller a few times, but I got no reply. I requested I be sent v. 5.0 instead.I researched sellers site too, but I was unable to find v. 5.0 at all. No v. 5.4 either.This must be due to periodic updates to the phones bios from the service provider or similar....Otherwise, the stuff I got was the real deal. Non functioning, but The Real Deal.Questions ?:518 894 0445"
1,Isn't software supposed to WORK?,"IT didn't work when we got it. So they told us to go to a website and download it there? Shouldn't we get our $5.00 back because the software didn't work?Tag Suggestions (click to add):razr, motorola phone tools, phone software, accessory, v325 cable, motorola, phone, phone tools, chargerMotorola Razr V3 Oem Original Usb Data Cable with ..."
5,Great product!!,"The Moto phone tools program is an excellent item for all my video, pictures, and music files. If you want to create your own ringtones, instead of paying for downloaded tones, this is the way to go. You can cut the song anyway you want, except taking the voice out of the music. I recommend this item for any one who like setting up their own tones and pictures!!"
1,V3c phone not supported,I bought this cable and CD to download the pictures off of my old V3c Razr phone but after an hour of installing and updating the software the software said my phone was not supported. So no luck on getting my pictures off of my phone. The cable does recharge the phone though when its plugged into the computer.
5,Great for making your owm ringtones,"This product does exactly what i needed, easily transfers photos and music to my Razr.I was also surprised that it included other programs, one that let's you take any song on your PC and edit it down to any length or portion of that song to use it as a ringtone. WORTH EVERY PENNY and then some considering how enexpensive this item is."
3,Works sometimes,"This program only works about half the time. Sometimes it won't recognize the phone. The ringtone maker works occassionally. The instructions are very basic and nothing can be found on the internet in regards to an error you receive when you transfer the ringtone to your phone. So if you want it strictly for pictures and contacts you are good to go, otherwise, I would forget this program."
2,Phone Tools,"Should have done more research on this before purchasing. The seller was great... but the software doesn't install on Windows XP Media Center edition (confirmed by Motorola tech support). However, I got the cable and CD for next to nothing so it's not like I'm really out anything. I'll just have to build another XP machine to install it on. :)"
1,Razr V3 OEM software,"This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon. While the item shipped in record time, I couldn't get it to load onto my PC. When I contacted the telephone number in the package listed as support, the tech said that the disk was probably damaged (considering the price, I can't complain on that point). He sent a hyperlink to me which (after 4 tries) worked. However the software still doesn't recognize my phone when it's plugged into the PC and I can't reach anyone at the tech support line for assistance. Just goes to show that you really do get what you pay for."
3,Review of Razr USB cable and phonetools,"The cable was sent in good condition; however, the cd came scratched and barely readable."
1,Not working with Sprint Motorola Razr V3 (CDMA),I have purchased it to use with Sprint Motorola Razr V3 but this software does not support Sprint Motorola Razr V3 phone. I called up Motorola technical support support but no luck. I wasted my money to buy this product.
2,Wouldn't work for me,"Even though the product description stated it was compatible with my Razr v3x, the software, even after update, would not recognize my phone. So for me, the only thing good about it was I didn't pay more than 1 cent plus shipping!"
2,Bad CD,I received the CD and was not able to used it was damage or the files were corrupted.The good part of it was that the company sent me a link to download the files.
3,"Cable great - software, not so good.","I wanted the cable to communicate with my PC and the inverse, but the Phone Tools software was not able to find the particular model RAZRV3, even after the updates. The cable was what I wanted, so I can live with that."
1,Motorola razer V3OOEM original Usb Data Cable with Motorola phone tool 4.0 softerware,Motorola razer V3OOEM original Usb Data Cable with Motorola phone tool 4.0 softerware did not work with vista
2,Data cable for Razor 3VM,Thought this cable would allow me to play songs on phone. Tried all parts of software and doesnt even have in the manuel you can do it but thought owner told me it did. It is nice for backing up phone numbers and data in phone. Backup usb cable is added bonus.
1,Motorola Phone Tools CD,software does NOT allow transfer(upload/download) of pictures to/from RAZR cell phone to/from computer which is an advertised feature of this software...
4,I like the item,I like this item it give me the ease of saving my pictures and other stuff to my computer so I dont loose them.
1,Did not work for me,"When I bought the disk it said it was suitable for my phone but now It is listed as for a Razr. When I purchased it, it listed other phones that the software was good for. So, It was a waste of my money."
1,"No CD, only cable","I received only the cable and no CD. When I contacted them, they said they were out of stock, suggested downloading the application from the Motorolla site. When I couldn't get the apps as suggested, they gave me a refund on my purchase."
1,NOTHING BUT A FRUSTRATION,"I bought this software and cable thinking I would finally be able to synch my V3 with my pc like I used to when I had an earlier model of Motorola mobile phone...what a piece of headache. The software installed...but failed to find my phone (for which it was designed to sync!).I wish Amazon would not sell problematic products...I hate having to try and ""figure"" out things after shelling out money...no matter how great a price. AMAZON, please do your customers a favor and remove headache products from your catalog. Reviews here say the software works well...but I cannot agree after buying it now.I am EXTREMELY disgruntled."
2,Disappointing,"Mick Fleetwood's memoir gave me the same reaction as Fleetwood Mac's album ""Behind the Mask"" - initial excitement that quickly gave way to disappointment and boredom. Certainly the familiar story of Fleetwood Mac's success and excess should add up to an interesting read, but this isn't it. There are long, boring passages about $2,000 phone calls, copious drug use, and gratuitous sex. Fleetwood reveals the worst kept secret of all - that he and Stevie Nicks had a relationship. At times, he emasculates Lindsey Buckingham, while forgetting that Buckingham helped create the band's magic. Fleetwood seems to placate Nicks by exaggerating her record sales (Fleetwood claims ""Bella Donna"" sold ten million copies - in reality it sold half that)and by saying that Nicks, in 1990, was ""better than ever."" Fans know (and Nicks has honestly said) that this was a low point in her career. I actually found Carol Ann Harris' book ""Storms"" to be a better read."
2,A good endeavor but lacking....,"Before I started reading this book I didn't know much about Fleetwood Mack and now that I've finshed it, I still feel like I don't know much about this band.The origins of Fleetwood Mack were probably the most interesting parts but then he stars skipping all over the place with no indication of where in their career he's referring to and things start to get a little murky and drawn out.Mick wrote this book and I don't think he should be writing any others."
5,So personal.........,"I am close to finishing this book which I learned was given to my husband many years ago. It has given me a personal insight into what I never looked at that way. Mick Fleetwood always seemed like a big freak to me. But he is ""fleetwood"" and he knows how it all went. It is truly an insight into his feelings and a lot more. If you love fleetwood mac, read this and learn all about them - and him, from the beginning.(I'm sure there is a lot you didn't know.). It is touching. Really. Just get it and read it. There's nothing else to say, except how moved I am by this book. Read it."
5,Great Book,"I bought this book for my theories of Persuassion Class. Although I found out that you really do not use the book all that often in the class, the material was still relevent to the class and even helped you understand and comprehend theories that perhaps your Romanian teacher couldnt explain quite as well herself."
4,A great overview of moden history of the world,"A great overview of moden history of the world that does an excellent job of pulling together all the major areas of the world in a broad overview. The only problem I had with it was the inconsistent coverage of (and a few mistakes in) the history of Muscovy/Russian Empire and Kyivan Rus/Ukraine/Belarus, although it's markedly better than previous history texts in this regard. It is also a 2001/2002 edition and as such doesn't cover 9/11, the following two American wars, recent EU/NATO expansion, the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the major destruction of human life and cultures from natural disasters in the past couple years, etc."
5,the work itself and other aspects,"The book itself is a superb work, detailing world history instead of being Eurocentric. It covers all civilizations since the beginning of time. More than 50 years ago, when I was in my freshman year, Eurocentrism, not a review of world civilizations was the vogue. This can bias one's attitude toward the world and how this country and the West relates to it. I have just received the book, and am thrilled with its contents.One extenuating factor was that the sections on the modern history of the world were heavily underlined and marked which was somewhat upsetting. Glance Books, who sent me the original copy, has gracefully offered to replace it with another intact copy in order that I can read this splendid book in peace."
2,Organization? Is that not in the authors' dictionary?,While this book contains valuable information it seems horribly put together in seemingly random order. Many-a-times I found that I would be reading the exact same sentence in Chapter 3 as in Chapter 4. The authors largely ignored any sort of geographical or chronological organization and just puts sections in wherever the mood struck them.
4,History 001 Textbook,The book was exactly as mentioned. I had no problems with shipping. I wish the seller would offer other shipping methods. Good transaction. Thanks.
5,Great!,I received this book very quickly and it was exactly what the seller described. Thank you for such fast delivery!! Fast shipping is always appreciated by college students!!
4,Cutse,"My mom gave this book to me for Christmas. It's just full of great tips and facts for any dog lover, from the seasoned veteran to the wet-behind-the-long-ears new pet owner. Beautifully illustrated and with such cute color pictures, too!"
4,Never thought I could find one!,"Received it about a week sooner than expected. I'd give this transaction 5 stars, but I haven't even used it yet."
3,By imaginary jessica,"The self-titled EP from Shoplifting recuperates the riot grrl sound with a fervor all their own. Serrated vocals fray over seesawing dissonant guitars, pairing the dark weirdness of Emily's Sassy Lime with Fugazi's now-infamous discordance. The track ""Raw Nails Now"" has all the markings of a chase scene. It dodges through alleys and vaults over chain-link fences, sidling out from around a corner only to break across a parking lot.The Seattle-based trio includes former members of the Chromatics, the Gossip, Stiletto, and Soiled Doves. Keep an eye on this band - this EP is hopefully just the start of something much, much bigger."
1,NO DICE,"Whatever you do, don't buy an integration kit from DICE ELECTRONICS. Mine stopped working after about five weeks and they wouldn't refund me because they only warranty their product for 30 days.Yup - an electronic component manufacturer that won't stand behind their product for longer than a month. I should have looked into it before spending the 200 plus.My money is gone plus the additional cash that I had to spend to have it removed - not to mention the money I'll have to spend on an integration kit that actually works (which I'm sure will be backed by the company - because it actually works)"
1,don't waste your money,"I saw an add on TV for these and then read some reviews on the net (some good some bad). I bought a case of these and wish I hadn't. The sauce tastes terrible (vinegary) and the noodles look, feel, and taste like plastic. Let's be honest here, this IS a crappy microwaveable lunch so I wasn't expecting anything great. I was still EXTREMELY disappointed. I have no idea how a product like this is out on the market. Didn't they do any panel taste tests?"
1,"Ewe, ick","I tried, I really tried to eat this. I've eat her spicier food and was pleased. I threw this out after a couple of bites. It tasted like vineger and stale peanuts."
1,This is definitely NOT Pad Thai!!!,"I don't know what this is supposed to be but it tastes truly awful. If I was served this in a restaurant, I'd be running for the door. It looked unappealing when I opened up the pack and it totally lived up to it's looks. I ate it because I was hungry and I'd paid for it - but it wasn't a pleasant experience at all. Nothing like any Pad Thai I've ever eaten. It tasted of what I imagine old cardboard to taste like. Ugh!"
1,Disgusting Excuse for Pad Thai,"I absolutely love Pad Thai. It is one of my favorite dishes and I have eaten it in several Thai restaurants and although the variations are slightly different, it is always delicious. I have been trying to find Pad Thai in a box that I can heat up quite easily and eat it quickly, since I do not have time to go to the Thai restaurant in my city all the time! However, every single time I've tried Thai food in a box, it is nasty. This is no exception.One weird thing is that the noodles already felt damp when I opened the package. And then I opened the sauce packet....oh, I just about lost my appetite then. Pad Thai does NOT smell like that!!! It smelled similar to soy sauce, but worse. And then I tasted it...the taste was not any better and the aftertaste is even worse.Don't waste your money on this. I'm never trying Pad Thai in a box again."
1,My poor garbage disposal...,"I fed my garbage disposal this stuff after taking a couple bites of it myself. It promptly unhooked itself from the bottom of my sink and jumped out of a third-story window, finding a brutal end on the stones below."
1,Not Annie's Best...,"I read all the reviews, but still wanted to give this a try. I love all of Annie Chun's soup bowls and really, really wanted to like this too. However, it was horrible! It smelled up the whole office and was so bad, I was embarrased. I bought a bunch of them, but they are going straight into the trash."
2,Pretty awful taste,"The good: This stuff is really well packaged and easy to make in the office. It comes in a biodegradable microwave-safe bowl, which is pretty awesome.The bad: It tastes nothing like pad thai.The ugly: It tastes awful, I don't know they managed to do this using natural ingredients - but it tastes very unnatural and leaves a lingering aftertaste. It will also help you continue on your way to hypertension and that first heart attack by giving you 60% of your sodium RDA in every bowl!"
1,EXTREME!,"Nasty. Absolutely NASTY! I can still smell it and I wish I couldn't. I only put a few drops of the sauce in because I hated the way it smelled, but I was still willing to give it a try because some great tasting things can smell bad.Nope... it was just as bad as it smelled. Extremely unnecessarily powerful flavor... kind of like drinking soy sauce and salt together. I guess someone might like it if their taste buds are numb.I will never touch another Annie Chun's product again because of this experience. I don't think their taste testers have my tastes because that was nasty to the EXTREME!If you buy this, then good luck."
2,disappointing,"flavor is okay but total product is disappointing, too many noodles, no veggies, high calories"
4,Arthur's Camp-Out,What a cute book! I think that most young children would enjoy this book even if they didn't like camping. It is adventurous and keeps you curious. I think that girls would especially like this book because it shows that girls can be campers too and that they don't have to be afraid of the animals or anything else for that matter! By reading this book I think that children would have less fear of camping.
5,The Greatest 3d Shooter of All Time,"What can I say? This is quite simply the greatest 3d shooter ever made. It may be short, but every level is unique, the bosses are huge, and most of the levels have more than one path you can take. Plus, when you beat the game tons of hidden game options are unlocked (level selection, dragon type, weapon type, just to name a few). The graphics are amazing, the music is astounding, the control is perfect, the gameplay supreme. I never forgot the first time my dragon took flight (my jaw dropped to the floor). Nor will I ever forget the first time I found the secret final boss. If you like shooters, or ever just good games, you must own this game."
5,Highest praise...,"I invite any book browser to read the opening lines of the first poem in this book, ""Selling Guns,"" and witness the work of the greatest poet of the American West working today. Laurie Buyer's work -- poetry and prose -- is unforgettable."
1,Art Depriciation...Poorly done....a waste of time,This so called critic has produced something very short of a work of art.The moment you hear the background music you can tell there is something very very wrong with this DVD. The cacophony of ear assailing vibrations are a perfect background for the lame and very drawn out explanation of silliness surrounding the critics thoughts on what the basis of the creative essence of the few pieces he has chosen.This idiot is not Sister Wendy......not by a long shot.Don't waste your time or your money on this waste of time.
5,Better than Hot Buttered Popcorn,"Miss Sonya just continues to get finer and finer. This latest CD is a pleasure through and through. ""Use Me, Lord"" will knock your socks off to the next county. And ""Heaven is Ten Zillion Light Years Away"" is joy through and through. It alternates in texture from velvet to satin. There is individuality in it and yet mixtures where a new voice emerges and delights the heart of the listener. This CD reflects a reveling in her Creator/Savior and a life that breathes ...life at it's best."
2,Disappointing,"Have you ever had an author who wrote certain passages well but the story itself was dodgy? I found that Michael Marshall is like that.Marshall is a UK author whose first three books concerned a group that had existed for many years and were dedicated to evil. Enter the two heroes of the book, a male and female FBI couple ala The X-Files Mulder and Scully.The books meander along with Marshall making observations about life that are readable but the story itself is too long-winded that while I read the first two books and ended them with little idea of what I had just read, the third book - Blood of Angels - was turning out to be a repeat, so I gave up.Not a bad author but he really was pushing it by writing a trilogy."
2,It gets kind of annoying,"Most peak flow meters that you buy at the pharmacy or through Amazon are going to have some type of certified standard of accuracy, and this one is no different. The readings on this PFM are consistent with readings from PFMs that we have had in the past, so I'm pretty sure it works fine. The one thing that I really can't stand about this thing is that to reset the meter, you have to tap the unit on a firm surface until it reads zero. Not very convenient, and when you try to take three readings to ensure accuracy, it can take a while to get it done. I don't understand why they would make a product that you have to bang against something, when there are so many PFMs out there that you can just reset by sliding the reader back with your finger."
3,Different Color than shown,Notebook was a different color than shown. Keep this in mind when ordering. May cause problem with middle school girls.....like mine!
3,Beats Me.,"I got this one together with the conditioner and tried them both - together and separately. The tangible, visible result/effect seems to come solely from the conditioner. Obviously it's a good quality shampoo and all but I'd say only buy the conditioner. It's got the penthanol, which is probably why you're getting it in the first place."
2,So so,It is very thick and like jello coming out of the bottle. I have not noticed any difference in my hair except that it is more difficult to comb after washing.
3,Okay,"I was so excited from the nice fragrance coming out from the bottle , but it didn't work that good for my hair , so I decided to try others shampoo from nature's gate"
5,For any musician looking to broaden their composition horizons!,"Just one watch of this DVD will give you both a deeper appreciation of Donald and the Dan, and a better concept of music. Don breaks down several of his and the Dan's tunes and goes into detail on how the chord changes apply.The DVD is in informal kind of conversation but at the same time gives great insight into the world of jazz/blues/rock music composition. This DVD will do away with the mentally-unchallenging I-V-iv-VI chords and instead go for Cmaj7-G(2)-Am7(sus4)-Em7(sus4) *Repeat* A(2)/C#-Cmaj7-G6-F#7-Bm7-E7(#5, #9)-Am7-C/D.After only watching that example, my writing skills have vastly improved.Also worth noting is a small booklet inside containing the keyboard sheet music for the songs demonstrated (12-Bar Blues, Chain Lightning, Peg, Josie, On the Dunes, Teahouse on the Tracks)."
3,Slightly dissapionting,"I really love Donald Fagen/Steely Dan. His playing is good his writing is fantastic. That said, don't expect to learn a heck of a lot from this video. The attempt is to explain the compositions- Fagen and Bernhardt are not really able to analyze the tunes that well. Bottom line- he just 'hears' it and he is super talented. If you want to see Fagen in a casual setting with some great playing then get the video, but don't expect to get too 'schooled'"
5,Luv this video!,"I am a huge fan of Doanld Fagen. Whether you play piano or not, I think you owe it to yourself to check this video out. I' ve learned a lot and I' m still learning. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I bought this camera for a photography class I was taking (I had to drop the class because of problems with the camera). The first camera Vivitar sent to me had a broken light meter, so I contacted the company to send it back and have it replaced. The company (Ace photo and digital) made me pay the postage to send back a camera that came broken, and then sent me a second camera that once again didn't have a functioning light meter. I would send it back a second time, but I think I'll just buy a light meter that works with the money I would have spent on postage."
4,Good Neil Simon adaptation.,Very good acting and Neil Simon's talent for dialogue make this a good video choice. Matthau is enjoyable in his three roles in the three different stories in the one plaza suite that comprise this film. Dated (so what?)and worthwhile.
3,Expected A Little More,One of those old movies that I'd heard about but had never seen before. Even the great Maureen Stapleton wasn't able to redeem the very weak plot. I expected a little more than what this movie turned out to be. Maybe people who actually stayed at the Plaza Hotel would enjoy it more than me.
1,Garbage! Don't waste your money. This movie is NOT funny.,"I don't know what the other people watched, but the first scene is just plain sad. The 2nd scene is salacious and shmarmy, bordering on sickening. Maybe the 3rd act had a funny moment or two, I'm sorry I rented it and definately glad I didn't buy it. Just because someone says it is funny, just don't make it so. I wonder about why people would promote this movie... could it be just to get you to buy something, even if it is bad...? Hmmmm... Buy something else, episodes of ""The Office"".... or almost ANYTHING for that matter."
4,Will it hold up better that factory original,"The replacment bumper looks great and installed easily. I believe Westin furnishes the bumpers to GM for ""original factory equipment"". I have seen several bumpers on trucks from the mid 1990's with similar rust through problems. I'm hoping this one will hold up better to our New England road salt."
3,One of the least interesting of SVH senior year...,"This book had three subplots. One was about Jessica and Trent having chemistry, and the implications while planning Jeremy's surprise party. Another was Maria having issues about her schoolwork and somewhat neglecting Ken. The last was Alanna making Conner meet her parents. I found this book to be one of the least funny and entertaining of all of the senior year series. I hope the next book is up to normal standards."
5,Very pleased so far,"I am a rank beginner. I have only used so far early chapters on position and posture, free and rest strokes and first string fingering. The video quality is very good. Mr. Hand shows instructions very clearly and camera follows action up close to visualize the details. I will update my review when I get to the later chapters, may be in a year or so?"
2,A dissapointed beginner,I have to say that I am disappointed after reviewing the DVD. I am a beginner but not unfamiliar with music.The first part of the DVD which I was counting on to give me basic right and left hand use and exercises did provide some but at a pace that was to fast. Further along the lessons which included arpeggios moved much to fast for my ability. I am going to buy either Pumping Nylon or Frederick Noad's complete beginners course.I can't honestly recommend this DVD course to any one. I would however suggest that the producer of the lessons separate them on the DVD so one can tell where one ends and practice should begin on that part before just blending them all together.
5,They used to charge me $10 to buzz my hair,"I don't know what's with hair ""stylists"" but they would always ask for $10+ just to shave off my hair, one even asked for $20. It takes like 5 friggin' minutes at most. With this convenient shaver you just grab some newspaper, plug it into your bathroom and you're done almost as soon as you get started. Sometimes the switch is kinda tough to turn on though, maybe it might have issues later?"
2,Just a close-up cut,If you think you are getting anything but a bald cutter than do not buy this item! The guards don't stand a shot of staying on so trying to give yourself or someone else a cut other than bald in all but impossible!
4,I liked it so much... I bought it twice!,"This set of clippers work great at cutting hair very short. I have had these for a few months and have used them weekly during that time. You'll notice the blades are smaller and sharper than the average clipper blades.I managed to break these recently by dropping them from a considerable height onto the hard floor surface of my bathroom - not Wahl's fault. However, I liked them so much I am buying another set.Only downside is the attachments - they seem a bit flimsy. I would've given the product 5 stars if the attachments had been a little more rigid.Finally, other reviewers have commented that the packaging features African American males only. As a pasty white guy, I can attest that these clippers do not discriminate. So get over it!"
1,wahl shaver,Shaver came defective. Etronics was very reliable - sent it back and got a refund with no hassles.
4,Good Buy,I got this for my boyfriend and although he didn't like it at first now he doesn't even want to visit his barber!
1,Wahl Balder,"This item failed within the first 5 minutes of use, apparently from a faulty switch. Amazon, however, replaced it the next day (fantastic service!) and I could not be more pleased with this clipper. It cuts evenly and quickly, far outperforming the two Norelco trimmers it replaced. While the first one earned only one star, the replacement gets five stars."
3,How embarasing,i bought this for my 16 year old white son. the packaging had afro-americans all over it no pictures of white people.... it came the day before christmas so i had no choice but to give it to him. the product might be good but they should seriously reconsider their packaging and amazon should seriously think about putting a picture of what the actual packaging looks like. i would have chosen one of the other wahl clippers if i would have known what the packaging looked like. wahl should know what this clipper is not for black people only. offended?? you bet.
5,Razor,"Super sharp blade. I have the classic male pattern baldness thing going on, so I want a close crop every other week. You'll want whomever is cutting your hair to have a steady hand. This was a good purchase."
3,Little too close....,While it cuts very well it also nicks the skin alot. I use it on my neck and I always end up with a cut or two.
5,LOVED IT!!!!!!!,"Chris Vrenna really sent some time thinking, on these melodies.There a mixture of eerie and happy and soft and creepy put together. You don't have to love the game to love this soundtrack."
5,Deeply disturbing and delightful,"The music from ""American McGee's Alice"" is haunting, heartbreaking, poignant, and perfect. From the tortured sobbing in ""The Centipede"" to the almost-comical plucked strings in ""Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum,"" coupled with the relentlessly ticking clocks and gothic voices, this album will truly affect any who are lucky enough to purchase it.Even if you aren't familiar with the game, the music conveys the nightmarish vision of American McGee's Wonderland gone wrong. The harpsichord, toy piano and various grinding gears all add depth to the dischord, a subtext to the soundtrack. One can feel how odd and sinister Alice's perceptions have become, as familiar characters become twisted and gruesome. Chris Vrenna's music is as powerful standing alone as it is accompanying the game.Game soundtracks aren't just bleeps and bloops anymore - they have a power and depth all their own. This album proves it beyond all shadows of doubt."
5,Good but Freaky!,"If you're going to buy it, here's a hint. DO NOT listen to it late at night when it's pitch black outside. Totally freaky! But this CD rocks!!!! I love #1,2,6,&13. Those are the best."
5,I LOVE IT,"I wish this CD was longer. The music is great. If you have played the American McGee's Alice you must own this CD. If you haven't yet played the game you have to it's the best game ever! The music is haunting and full of imagination. It takes you on an adventure, from when Alice's home burns down with her parents trapped inside. She works her way though her trauma while in the twisted world of wonderland. You will hear things like... Grand clockworks, sounds from the mirror maze of robots, those toy music boxes, Sobbing, the cheshire cat's twisted riddles, and quotes form the characters in the game at the start of most tracks. All in all this CD is a must have for any collection."
5,From Trent to Chris,"First off, I do not own this soundtrack, but I just finished the game and loved the music. When the credits rolled down and I saw Chris' name, I just about flipped. I have been a fan of Nine Inch Nails for years now, and I always figured Trent was the only musical genius in the group (as NIN is really just Trent Reznor with a travelling band for touring only). This is a testament to his creative brilliance, and I now have another idol :)"
3,In Stock or Not?,"Don't be fooled by the message of ""1 in stock, more on the way"" for there WAS ""2 in stock..."" when I ordered back on the 7th, its now the 16th and I am told they are Still waiting for their order to be fullfilled (apparently there is ""0 in stock, and hopeing to get more"").Well, when it comes (if it comes) I hope its as good as I've been told...so much for ""Standard 3~5 day shipping"" costs.:?"
4,Good but a bit too polished,"The music is well put together and can be quite immersive but it is very obvious that the album is digital. Vrenna said he used vintage children's toys as musical instruments but the sound is so clean and sharp that it sounds like everything was made with a computer and keyboard. I think the music would lend itself well to a bit of dirtiness. Wonderland Woods is a song that I would have given five stars in my little iTunes rating thing, had it brought to mind Wonderland or a choir rather than a keyboard.I find some of the samples cheesy and a couple tracks are subpar compared to what Vrenna shows he is capable of in other songs. But I suppose considering it's a soundtrack, they are probably meant more to fit with a certain environment than provide good listenin'."
2,Gumdrop ball with colored tips,This ball was bigger than I thought it be and is hard pastic. This would be a great toy for large dogs.
3,A favorite,"This is one of my border collie's favorite toys. Buyer should be aware, however, that if you bounce it off a painted wall, it will leave colored paint marks which will not wash off - we had to repaint our wall."
3,I like this despite it's flaws,I really like this one. It is obviously from the early 70's around the time of the HAG album. It gives the listener a glimpse of the average Merle Haggard concert of that era. I think the version of Soldiers Last Letter shows off those amazing pipes whereby he changes the melody a bit on the opening line: it's a good example of his genius. Listen to the studio version and you'll see what I mean. I think this is a good representation of the period...though one whole complete concert with no pauses would have been much better. I would rather have this cd than not have it at all. I wish there were more...
1,THERE ARE DEFINITLY BETTER LIVE COLLECTIONS,"Merle Haggard has been recording for about 40 years. He has been all over the country doing concerts. Where someone got the idea to put this thing togather and call it LONESOME FUGITIVE-LIVE, I have no idea.There are far better live recordings on these same songs(ex. OKIE FROM MUSKOGEE-LIVE IN MUSKOGEE). Some of them sound like they were recorded off of a warped vinyl album.Too, there absolutely no notes about any of these songs. There are no dates when they were played. The title suggests they were all done at one concert at some unknown location, but the tracks have no talking or introducing or presenting of any kind(SOLDIER'S LETTER does have Merle saying ""Goodnight,"" but the song is in the middle of the album). Why bid goodnight half-way unless folks were getting bored and leaving?I believe you are wise to spend your shekels on something else of Merle's besides this."
1,Quite Boring - collectors item?,"Courture's conservative offense, Vitor's bad conditioning, McCarthy's safety-for-fighters consicious call, and promoter's lack of preparation for NOT having an alternate in the heavy weight tournament makes this one the worst UFC ever. However, for true NHB fan, this one is still worth a buy because this is the first and the only Octagon appearance of ""may-be-the-best-fighter-in-the-world-today"" Kazushi Sakuraba. This is the man who comfortably defeated Belfort, Newton, and Braga, The only undefeated man in the NHB world other than Rickson Gracie. Some says the reason for Frank Shamrock's departure from UFC is his strong desire to fight Sakuraba in PRIDE events. So this video has great potential to be a collectors item in ten, twenty years!!!"
1,Probably the worst UFC ever!,"Tank Abbott wins a boring decision & referee Big John McCarthy makes the worst call of his career in the 4-man Heavyweight tournament. Vitor ""The Fastest Hands in the UFC"" Belfort doesn't throw a single punch in a bout with a man old enough to be his father. Frank Shamrock makes short work of Olympic gold medalist wrestler Kevin Jackson for the Middleweight championship. The Heavyweight championship will put even the most hardcore fans to sleep."
3,Good for the price,"Cons:-Loud-Plastic parts seem a little flimsy-Can't handle a full load-The wine glass holders on the top shelf are too short...so you can't even put a wine glass under them-Tall (regular, just not short) glasses can only go on the outsides, too tall to fit in the middle of the rackPros:-Great size for 2 people/condo-Most inexpensive one for the size-Good amount of cleaning options (hot, super hot, pans, etc)You basically get what you paid for. It's not super quiet, but it gets the job done. I would not actually put 8 place settings in this puppy. I would give enough room between each plate if you really want them clean. Also wouldn't suggest waiting to fill it up til it's full, generally because I don't think it can do a good job if the food was stuck/dried on the plate. So either rinse well after use, and just use this to sanitize...or run it daily."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased this dishwasher to install in a small kitchen. Worked great for 14 months and now will not fill with enough water to run the cycle. Had the water inlet valve replaced and it worked for one cycle and again wouldn't fill with the proper amount of water. Manufacture would not cover repairs (product has 1 yr warranty)!
1,destroy,this game sucks the graphics are extremly poor theres no custom soundtracks like narc for example but that game is good this one is not if you dont believe me find out for yourself you have been warned
5,Timeless Memoir Captures Youth Like No Other,"I read this book for the first and second times last night.It was my second time, because I had read the book when first published. But because I lived in Hawaii back then, perhaps I could not fully absorb the stunning setting and the author's many insights about island life.I lived in Hawaii for 25 years, and in my second reading Ms. Nelson captured and returned me to 1970s Hawaii. At the same time, I learned a great deal from her book that I did not discern during my time in Hawaii.The book is about much more than Hawaii. Anyone who has ever been young will identify with this memoir, and will come away richer for the author's uncanny powers of observation about universal themes."
2,"Good explanation of anatomy, not a good variety of exercises","This book does a good job of explaining the anatomy and function of the abdominal & back muscles, but it's hard to follow because you have to flip back and forth to get to the correct diagrams. There isn't a good variety of exercises. Many of the exercises require cable machines that aren't available at the gym I go to. Definitely not a book for doing exercises at home."
3,"Pretty good book on ab development, but outdated","I have to give this book credit, it sticks to its topic very well, making the book concise and easy to follow. It opens with the basics of ab anatomy and then moves in to various exercises and programs for strengthening and developing the abdominals. Only at the end does it stray slightly off course and discuss the nutritional aspects of ab development.The one area where this book stands out (and my reason for purchasing it a while back) is that it focusses on the pelvic tilt associated with improper ab development. For about $... it might be worth it just for this information.The downside is that this book is out of date. Swiss balls are the current rage in ab developed and the book author has titles devoted entirely to this subject, yet they aren't mentioned once."
2,Against all enemies,I was very disappointed in this book. Too many characters with too many hang-ups. The only thing I found Clancy-like was the fact that he used a similar sub-plot (terrorists and a strain of the Ebola virus)as Clancy in Rainbow-Six.This book was a chore to finish.
2,Disappointing; sloppy editing,"I thought that this book was of a much lower quality than his previous novels. The editing was sloppy (at least two different characters in two different settings used the expression ""like stink on a skunk""). In one instance a character's name was replaced with different character's name, leading to some confusion. Plot and character development were superficial. This book was an obvious ""quicky"", both in writing & editing."
1,This book leaves you wondering what you missed.,"I understood the basic concept. I understood the idea that in attempting to blow up a Sudanese sight, two B-2 pilots were captured, tortured, and a rescue was planned. I even understood the minute intricacies of the rescue plan. But why was the character called ""Meredith"" never explained or developed? What was his part in the whole thing? Were there two stories going on? I think the author attempted to mix politics with action/adventure and failed. Technicalities and legalese were mixed and confusing as well. In all, it was a very difficult story to follow. Many pages I read just because they were there, and I felt as though if I read them over and over again I still wouldn't get it. If you are truly bored to tears and there is no other book available, you might enjoy some of this book. Otherwise, forget it. It sucks."
4,Against All Enemies,"This is my first time to read this author. I enjoyed the book very much. It is very interesting and although it was difficult to keep some of the characters straight, because of the many sub-plots, I never wanted to put it down. His characters are likeable and his plots intriguing. I'm looking forward to reading more of his books."
3,"Good story, bad editing.","An enjoyable read. If you like the stories of Clancy, or similar authors, you'll like this. You do have to be prepared for some annoyingly sloppy editing, however."
1,I had the misfortune of watching Horsemen,"The Horsemen was directed by Jonas ckerlund and stars Dennis Quaid and Ziyi Zhang. It had a very limited release(in only 5 cities) and quickly disappeared to DVD. It was the first and hopefully last movie ever directed by Ackerland whose background consists of directing music videos.The plot of Horsemen borders on the preposterous. A small group of nut cases begin killing people for reasons that defy logic.I rented this movie because I am a fan of ZZ and wanted to see her in a Hollywood movie. My guess, she regrets having gotten into this worthless project."
2,"Great product, poor CD - the band and music that is",The provider shipped a great product. The band and music did not live up to expectations.
2,I should have bought just the song I wanted from iTunes,"Not a great album. There are a few wonderful songs, however, I think the others suck. Too bad I didn't just get the individual songs off of iTunes and saved my money."
3,sounds a bit dated,"Overall it seems like Utah Saints are trying to see what sticks when they throw a potpourri of styles at the wall. Songs range from a definite Moby-esque style, complete with gospel vocals, to a definite Underworld track; ""Morning Sun"". ""Techknowledgy"" is Utah's attempt at a Prodigy/PrimalScream style.The digital soundscape is somewhat dated as well. Old, over-used Roland drum-loops and other sample-loops a la mid-90's don't do much to inspire the listener.A few songs may shoot up the charts, but this album will be forgotten, unlike their debut many years ago."
1,Not quite satisfied,"I knew the bible was used, I just didn't expect it to be written in. It had been given as a gift, and the inscription was still on the front inside cover. These details should be disclosed."
5,TOTALLY EASY!!,"This is truly the best of both worlds!! If you want to get serious about your bible study-yet not spend all of your time trying to ""decode"" the interpretations of the language used in Biblical times--this is the way to do it! By having ""The Message"" interpretation alongside the NIV readings, it really helps you to understand immediately what the scripture is referring to. We are using this now in our,(Southern Baptist), Bible study class - with our Preacher's blessings- and everyone loves it!"
5,Awesome!!!!,This is the best Bible I have ever had. It makes it so much easier to understand the NIV version when translated into modern language! Highly recommend it.
4,As Expected,"The shipping was fine, article I purchased was as I expected. It really is a great translation and I enjoy Eugene Peterson. A very down to earth translation of the Bible good for all ages and personalities. When the bible seems a bit stuffy or confusing, the parallel wording is right there."
3,"Last Breath, Michael Prescott","A gripping read once you got past the overly graphic autopsy this story began with. How many times do we have to be bombarded with the grizzliness of the autopsy table in books and in movies, time to move on authors, we have had more than enough. I did persevere, skipping over these pages to see if this story was worth a read and have to say that I enjoyed the book. I do not agree with some of the criticisms in other reviews, alot of Authors have many coincidences and exagerations in their books which have to be there to make the story work, after all we are talking about fiction. If you like cat and mouse stories I recommend you give Last Breath a read."
4,Last Breath,Good read. Could not put it down until I finished it. Actually deserves 4.5 stars. I never give 5 stars.
4,Great Read (Not a Spoiler Review),"I thought the book was excellent. It's fiction, and the story is not realistic. So what. If you're looking for a realistic novel, read non-fiction. The villain is almost comic-book in his abilities and interests. I enjoy the premise, the heroine motivated and scared by a disturbing incident, and the other characters in the book using it to their advantage. Definitely as others argue it's a stretch of reality, but then again, that is why we call it fiction. If you're looking for a true crime novel look elsewhere, if you're looking for an entertaining read, this book will suit you just fine."
4,Last Breath. by Michael Prescott,"Michael is the type of author I enjoy. Suspense is held right till the last, so there is no chance of anticipating how it will end. This is the type of easy read I enjoy, whether travelling or at home, always with my kindle!!"
4,Great Suspense-Couldn't put it down!,"This book had a great suspense thriller plot. It was like watching a movie on TV. I could picture the scenes and the characters. This was my second read by Michael Prescott and I loved it just as much as ""Blind Pursuit"". Great great author. Thanks for such a great thriller!"
4,"I HELD MY BREATH READING ""LAST BREATH""","I didn't read this for quite a while after purchasing after reading a negative review with spoilers. I'm glad I went back to it, because I enjoyed every sentence of this page turner! I loved CJ's spunk, hope to read more about her."
4,PRETTY GOOD READ,"This is my first Michael Prescott book, it won't be my last. Prescott's LAST BREATH is a super fast passed read with several threads to keep thing interesting. LAPD officier Caitlin Osborne is or becomes the center of each. If you like police action, this one's for you. The book was published in 2001 but still holds up well. Great beach read. RECOMMENDED"
2,Last breath,Very average. Weak suspenseNot well crafted and didnt hold my attention. I like sone of his other books better
5,I'm a Prescott fan,"I've loved all his first books but as they keep coming, I'm not as excited. I couldn't wait for Mortal Thoughts to come out. It was nothing compared to his earlier writings. Good thrilling reads that are not easy to spell out until the end."
3,last breath,I gave a 3 star because to me it was very hard to get into it at first. but then watch out.
4,LAST BREATH....WAS MY 1ST PRESCOTT NOVEL....BUT NOT THE LAST,"LAST BREATH....HOLDS YOUR ATTENTION..THE CHARACTORS COME ALIVE, THERE IS DEPTH AND SURPRISES THAT MANY WHO ATTEMPT CAN NOT TOUCH.JEFFREY DEAVER IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE AND I MUST SAY IF MICHAEL PRESCOTT'S OTHER BOOKS ARE THIS GOOD....I'LL READ ANYTHING HE WRITES.THIS BOOK STARTS AS A 10 YEAR OLD GIRL DETERMINED TO STAY HOME ALONE...FINALLY GETS HER PARENTS CONSENT.ENTER BOOGYMAN....IS SHE ASLEEP OR IS THERE SOMEONE REALLY IN THE HOUSE....HOW MANY OF US HAVE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE?PURE TERROR RAINES HER 1ST NIGHT HOME ALONE.NOW CJ IS AN ADULT,,,, A POLICE OFFICER FIGHTING HER FEAR BY FACING FEAR FOR A LIVING....CAN SHE OUT RUN A NIGHTMARE OF HER PAST? OR WERE HER PARENTS WRONG WAS IT A NIGHTMARE AT ALL?I HATED TO SEE THIS BOOK END, THAT'S HOW REAL ALL THE CHARATORS ARE.DON'T MISS THIS BOOK...I'M NOW A DEVOTED FAN."
4,"Won't leave you breathless, but a very good book.","I was pulled into the story from the beginning, but then it's grip loosened a little, maybe because the backstory slowed the pace too much. Other than that, Last Breath is a very well written story. Cudos Mr. Prescott."
1,Last Breath,Thank goodness I only paid three dollars for this incredibly poor novel. Dumbest thing I have ever read which only requires that a miracle occur every few pages in order to move the story along.
4,"Not bad, kept turning pages quickly most of the time.","I give it 4 stars because at one point the book lost my interest for a brief moment. I love a story when it rolls, keeps my suspense up, this didn't do it for me at some point in the book. Loved the beginning chapter, ending was good as well. This book is not very gory but a great thriller read."
1,Gratuitous Purposeless Violence,"This is my second Prescott book and while I enjoyed Blind Pursuit, I didnt enjoy this one. While the other book had strong female characters (two), this one had a strong female character who was stalked by not one, but two killers. I am tired of the gratuitous violence against women in both print and on film. It appears that Mr. Prescott has cheapened his writing by adopting this as his only style. Repressed hatred of women or just catering to the lowest common denominator? Mr. Prescott, you are a better writer than this."
1,Unbelievable,"I can't believe someone over 17 could be entertained by this. How about some realism for once!Many things in the book would never happen. Therefore, it totally killed the story midway through the book for me.It's sad to think people are entertained by such a weak job, almost like the movie Face Off or something. Often I like the Vintage Collection books and they're not as exciting but at least they are realistic."
3,Not bad but...,"Without giving away too much of the story I was totally amazed that all the people he thanked allowed the endless back-story of past murders; listed one after the other which seemed to go on ad nauseum with no action whatsoever! Slowed to pace to stop where I just turned pages on my Kindle. On the other hand, the story was cleverly done. I can tell you there's no way all those cops would have been allocated to that final stakeout!"
3,A strong 3.5 stars,"This is the third Prescott book I have read. I enjoy that most of his books cover a suspenseful incident in a 24-hour period. There are enough twists and turns to keep the story interesting and exciting. While the number of things that go wrong at exactly the wrong time is excessive, I always enjoy how he works the heroine out of the situation. It's not great literature, but a fun fast read, and I will pick up more by this author."
3,"Pretty good, but . . .","Last Breath is a pretty good read. The idea of a would-be killer, a woman's ex-husband, mimicking the modus operandi of a serial killer to kill his ex-wife and have it blamed on the serial killer, is inventive and worked for me. Naturally, our heroine, CJ Osborne, a plucky LAPD detective, intervenes and that's the story worth reading here.The problem I had with the book was the distraction in the beginning, which was well written, about CJ's childhood ""bogeyman,"" who then disappears until the end of the story. It's all unrelated to the main plot and didn't do much for me in character development of CJ.On balance, this is a worthwhile read, but it could have been tightened and much improved by sticking to the main story."
4,Good but not complete,"Just finished reading Meyers' new A+ certificate book and thought I would test my knowledge with the included practice tests. Oops, unfortunately some of the practice test questions assume knowledge not presented in the book. I know because after missing a couple I scoured the text but was unable to find the missing information. That aside the book was informative and easy to read. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the A+ certification."
2,"Not Enough Information, even for its own exams!","This book doesn't provide enough information. Even with its own online practice exams, there are many questions that you can't answer after reading the book.For example:The definition of dot pitch is ______D. The diagonal distance between two phosphours of the same color.This question was on its own practice exam, and it pointed to Chapter 9. Yet after scanning all of Chapter 9, this term ""dot pitch"" didn't appear anywhere! It's also not in its own index! And this is just one example. Many other questions are the same.If you are studying for this exam, don't rely on this book alone. Use a more thorough book. This book is alright for reviewing critical information, but isn't exhaustive enough."
3,I also found mistakes and contradictions.,"I'm now on Chapter 11 and I plan to finish the book, carefull reading and studying to learn this information and hopefully to pass the test. I have to say that I found the exact same mistakes that were noted by the reader review titled ""Full of dumb mistakes and contradictions"". The book may be a first edition, but such a work should have been vetted by readers that could find the errors!!!"
5,A+ Success with Flying Colors,"I used this book for most of my study for the A+ exam. Shortly before each of the core and OS tests, I read the chapters again. It covers in great detail just the information that you need to know. I also used the All In One A+ Certification manual of his too. Its a must have book to be a good computer tech. The passport is easier to study and pass the test, but the full volume is necessary to be a good tech. I would not take a certification test without one of his books. I highly recommend getting this book.Thanks Mike!"
3,"Don't bother reading the reviews, they are for the old book.",Amazon has all the old pre 3rd edition reviews posted. These reviews are for the old books and the old exams.
2,Terrible Hardware section,"I first purchased this book hoping to pass the test because I read other text too. When i read through the part where it talksabout Processors he states AMD as America Mega Devices and if the information is new to you you would not know that the realmeaning of AMD is Advanced Micro Devices but I took the test thinking that I was going to pass but I found out that the onlything that was useful was the information on the IRQ assignmentsand I/O adresses and my score was a 505 ten pnts away from passing but I just retook the test this time I used Jean AndrewsA+ Guide to Hardware and I passed with a 548 33pnts above passing, so don't waist your money on this mess"
1,MEDOCRE BOOK - LOUSY CD,BOOK IS MEDIOCRE READING WITH CROWDED CONTENT. THE CD WITH THE PRACTICE EXAMS WILL NOT RUN ON MY BRAND NEW COMPUTER. IF THESE FOLKS CANT PRODUCE A CD THAT WORKS - HOW CAN THEY TEACH YOU A+ CERTIFICATION.
2,Ok foundation book...,I just passed the A+ Certification exams. This book helped... barely. The book was missing a lot of information and sometime had incorrect information and table/diagram references - really annoying.The CD and practice questions are a joke. They will NOT fully prepare you for the real thing.The reason for a second star is simply that this was the only resource I used for the test and I passed (but I had to write the OS exam a second time).Not a great book. Better out there. May help you pass.
3,Fluffy... but informative,"Apparently the author, Michael Meyers, is renowned for his IT certification study guides, but I don't see why. The book is informative and does definitely have significant test coverage. Unfortunately, it is full of a lot of fluff and unneeded information, which makes it hard for those simply looking to pinpoint key exam information. I give it three stars for decent formatting and overall good exam coverage, but I enjoyed the FastPass series much more."
4,Good beginner book,"This book is geared more towards somebody that has very little knowledge of computers. The book is more in depth with the hardware aspect of the A+ exam. I would recommend this book to people who have little to no experience working inside of a pc, and if you are planning on taking the exam I would suggest using this book in conjunction with another study guide."
2,"Mike Myers' A+ Cert, Second Edition","This book is written wonderfully and easy to follow. It gives a good basic undertanding of how computers work and the different parts interact with each other. However, it is geared toward an older standard of the CompTIA A+ Essentials certification. Therefore it includes some older technologies that are no longer relevant and does not include some of the newer standards. I only paid a dollar and change for the book so it was still worth the money and time to read it."
5,Excellent Study material,I used Mike Meyers A+ Passport in conjuntion with Selftest's A+ practice tests and passed both exams (HW & OS) on first try. I found the book to be concise in its treatment of the material and objectives. This approach made passing the exams a breeze. Now on to the Network+ exam using Network+ Passport.
5,Good book for both exams,"This book has all you need for the two A+ exams. It's written very clearly and thoroughly. I liked the ""passport"" approach - it broke items into clear pieces. The book was well organized and clear. The exam on the included CD had a couple of answers that were wrong, but overall, this is a great way to learn the subjects, for the price. I took the two tests on the same day - 30 minutes total, for both tests, and I passed. If I were to recommend only one A+ book to friends, this would be it."
3,Needs updating,"I recently bought the book and the A+ exam has been updated on November 26th, 2003. If you're thinking about taking and passing A+ exam, then don't buy this edition - It doen't contain new important information you need to know (Serail ATA, P4 processors, Win XP). I was dissapointed those information were not included, even though P4 and Win XP has been around for a while."
5,A+ certification...,I read th whole book. Now I am ready and well prepared to take my A+ certification exam. Thanks Mike Meyers.
1,Bad Luck Purchase,"I bought the master steam, black iron a week ago at K-Mart to give to my daughter for her birthday. I paid 20.00+ for this iron (on sale) and gave it to my daughter who had just moved into a lovely new home. I was the first person to use the iron and thought it very acceptable. When my daughter used it, the same week I purchased it there was near disaster because the iron started to spit out dark brown water etc. and smoke and it smelled terrible. So we shut it off not daring to continue with the iron process. Apparently for some unknown reason this iron burned up on the inside!! Never in all of my many, many years of ironing have I experienced anything like this. I really don't care to return the iron to K-Mart because I'm afraid I'll only get taken again. So - what should I (we) do about this? I am so disappointed and rather embarrased to have given my daughter such a poorly chosen gift.Any guidance you can give me will be appreciated. Thank you.JoAnne CotaJoCota@yadtel.net"
1,not happy,"At first I was impressed with this unit, but after 3 or 4 successful feeds, my 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper got lost inside the unit, rolling around the barrel. Unfortunately there is no easy way to open the unit to fix the problem. Basically you end up throwing it away and buying a new one since it is not that expensive to begin with. I guess you get what you pay for!"
1,Still trying to get this laminator to actually laminate.,"Since purchasing this laminator, have tried a couple different types of laminating pouches (the ones that came with the machine and another kind from a chain office supply store). After several tries with both types of pouches and documents of different thicknesses, there has only been one moderate success. Using the pouches that came with the machine and a thin image from a printer, the lamination actually took - however, the resulting product may be too flimsy for its intended use."
2,Lasted 18 months,Bought this for the men in the Training department to laminate checklists they fold into thirds. They used the thinnest envelopes and were happy with it until the spokes broke inside making it useless. They claim it was NOT Operator Error!
1,Broken quick,"Laminated 2 drivers licenses, 2 registrations, 1 insurance id...... on the 2nd it jammed to never be removed again. If I attempt anymore it will surely catch fire.Now the fun.. have to figure out how to return it and what it'll cost me and if it's worth it.I have thrown good money after bad before. Maybe just cut my losses."
3,Vivitar AP1 battery holder,The all in one Vivitar battery holder is extremely tight when placing it in a Vivitar 283 flash. I don't think it was designed to the 283 but will work as long as you apply enough pressure to insert it. And have needle plyers to pull it out.
2,Dull,"A very dull and uninteresting collection of songs with drums. The songs sounded vaguely new-age with slight contributions from Bhangra style. Then songs really aren't all that bad, but none of them are really memorable or interesting. They all seem to kind of run together. The cover art is better than the music."
3,Pretty good,"eehhhhh..... Its ok. Very nice because of the novelty of it, but Urban Disco definitely not. If this is what infuses the urban dance scene (which it doesn't), then get ready for Lawrence Welk. Good drum beats but not too tight, and not enough drive or bass to be dance music.Very nice to hear some fusion between soft electronics and cultural music. Kodo remixes are WAY better (Sai-so)."
4,I love this watch,"I disagree with C. White's review because it was deceiving and it discouraged me a little before I bought the watch. But I was very happy when I received this watch because the size isn't tiny. In my opinion, the watch is just the right size--not big like a man's watch if that's what you are looking for. It's sleek and sophisticated, and it is of good quality. I am always very picky with my purchases, but I am very happy with this watch."
2,Not as great in person,"I returned this watch because when I received it, I didn't think the quality was that great. It just felt cheap. Also, it's much smaller than I thought it would be. I have very small wrists, and the watch just didn't look right. The face and band should be much wider - it looks weird when wearing it. The watch looks great online, but it was disappointing when I actually received it."
1,Wack,"The whole album is WACK af!!! The only thing hard on there is the rap chick Flawless a.k.a. Panama & the tracks Produced by Mike Dean. If you want ""ICE CUBE"" just buy the real thing not a replica! Other than that??? This album is Straight WOOD CHIPS!"
2,Bitin' Cube,"Dorasel undoubtedly has skillz, but is bitin' Ice Cube like craaaazy. hes got the same flow technique almost exactly. Like all the Pac biters out there....any real rap critic loses alot of respect and credibility towards the artist. Remold your style and come hit us with sumthin original bro. otherwise the beats and rhymes are pretty sick...but why not listen to Cube?"
5,"High energy, edgy and lyrical","So we drove to Arkon to see Vonda Shepard and this girl I'd never heard of (Anne E. DeChant) was opening for her. Except that most of the people in the Arkon theater were there to see Anne. She rocks. Her energy and fearlessness come across as well on ""Something of the Soul"" as they did on stage. The person selling CDs in the theater lobby recommened this as the Anne E. DeChant CD to own if you're only going to own one...."
5,good screen,"I got it pretty cheap and was favorably impressed with the picture. I put in on a desk that's against the wall, without the base, and it takes up no space at all, gives me a giant picture.I use it as a TV replacement, watch videos etc. on it seated 5 feet back and it works great. Watched the super bowl on it and it was like HDTV.BEWARE that if you have an older computer you may need to upgrade your graphics card to use any widescreen, happened to me. If it happens to you, don't buy the card in a chain store where they will rip you off, try online."
4,"Hanns 19"" LCD Monitor","I purchased a new Hanns 19""monitor after 3 years with my Sharp 17"" LCDI was excited about getting it but was not happy with it when it arrived.The sharpness of the picture quality was not what I expected, Blurred words and not sharp and clear as others I have seen or the sharp I had.This coud be due to the old computer I have and not being able to connect the Video Input cable on it. Not sure. I have a new state of the art Dellcoming and hope it will provide bettr results. As far as everything else great deal on Amazon for the 19"" monitor."
5,VERY RESILIENT! 4 years of constant abuse!,"I would give this product 10 stars if I could!I bought this monitor 4 years ago after building a brand new system & it is still running just fine. In fact it outlasted the computer. I have never had any problems at all. I've used both the VGA & DVI on 2 separate computers on a daily basis, flawlessly.I'd also like to note that I consider myself pretty hard on things like monitors & such. Not only has this worked through 4 years of daily gaming, movies, etc. But has also survived being dropped once during a move while boxed up. And once had a considerable amount of liquid splashed directly onto the screen by accident (set my beer down & it exploded). Even after all that.....no flaws at all. If that's not considered resilience, I don't know what is.CON: I wish I got this for one-hundred, 9 bucks. I paid one-seventy nine + shipping. On sale!"
5,Great Display,"Bought this on a whim, Hanns.G is, or at least was not a mainstream manufacturer when I was shopping for displays. Reviews looked good on the Egg so i picked it up for I think 175 about 18-24 months ago.Came with NO dead pixels and still has none.Perfect size, though I might pick up a second for programming/design. With 22"" you would probably be fine with 2 windows open.Anyway, seems like decent color, though I have not played with the settings too much. Contract could be a bit better but what are ya gonna do.I would absolutely recommend this product, in fact I may just get another."
4,Canceled Order?,"my damn order got canceled, then my bank account was missing the exact amount that the monitor cost for over a week. i finally got my money back after they had CLAIMED that my credit card wasn't charged. overall i love the product, not a single dead pixel, bright as hell. so bright i turned it down to 50% and its STILL brighter than either of my ctr monitors"
4,Great monitor for the price!,"Pros:-Great price for a 19 inch widescreen!-DVI-D support-No dead pixels (on mine)Cons:- Speakers are horrible (however if you are dropping this much money on a monitor, you can put up a few more bucks for a descent pair of speakers)Overall: Best 19 inch widescreen for the money in my opinion. I highly recommend."
3,Good performance at a reasonable price,A decent replacement for our old monitor. Worked right away straight out of the box (we did not use the digital connections). The resolution is quite good for everyday tasks; watching movies with the widescreen display is nice. The flat panel doesn't take up much space either. The only real deficiency is the speakers which are integrated into the unit. The sound quality is poor and the volume cannot be adjusted to adequate loudness: we ended up getting some external speakers instead.
4,Good monitor for the price,I got the monitor and set it up and initially used an old VGA cable and got some very bad pictures and ghost images. I changed over to the cable included with the LCD monitor and voila! It's clean and pretty. I got lucky and not a single dim or off pixel. Been playing Xbox 360 and watching DVDs on it as well as computing. Works great. Happy with the purchase. Seems they have a typical warranty as well.
4,HW191D Hanns-G Monitor,This monitor is absoulutely amazing.This is the third LCD monitor that I have owned.Super image due to high contrast ratio and DVI input.The only down side is the built in speakers. They work but not well enough for music.Tim
2,"Hanns-G HW191D 19"" widescreen LCD","Although the definition is impressive, there's alot of fuzzy speckelation. The built in speaker system is very limited in range and frequency. So basically don't buy it for it's sound. The color is off from other screens. Images, although in high def, show up on a green/yellow tone. I attempted a few dozen different color configurations using the screen's onboard color controls with no luck. My primary screen shows images normally. I compared it to plasma, lcd, lpd, and ctr and this screen indicates a particular defect. I do not recommend this screen for graphic design."
1,Major problem with this monitor - Eating Graphic Cards!!!!,"After 1 year with no problems, my computer died, after turning on the power button. As a result the screen did not start and stayed black. I connected an older PC to the same screen, believing the problem cam from the PC. The same thing occurred. I pulled the graphic card and switched to the ""old"" on-board graphic and connected to a different monitor. Computer runs fine. Now I a scared to connect it to Hanns HW191D to kill my next card. As a result I will buy a more expensive brand monitor and put this thing were it belongs.... GARBAGE."
2,not everything the title suggests,"Well, the ideas presented in this book about people defrauding the system are worth wild, no honest person is in favor of that. But their ideas on how to ""fix"" the problem are returning the marginal tax rates to the pre 1981 Reagan tax reform. There is no mention that these ultra high marginal rates actually collected LESS money from the ""wealthy"", because they had many more loopholes to avoid the 80% marginal rates. They also don't mention that if indeed, the marginal rate on for example stock market gains were 70%, who would bother to invest? Conservatives will not like this book, liberals will."
5,Justice Evasion,The authors just added to the indignation I share with fellow citizens over the failure of the rich and powerful to pay their fair share -- or even not to pay anything. It is a corollary that capitalists love to play with other people's money. It is also a habit to force the tax burden on to those less able to defend themselves politically. Perhaps we have to have a complete tax revolt and abandon withholding tax. The rich would have much to lose in anarchy.
5,changed my life,"This book is fantastic. It is beautifully written and is one of the few books I've read that I can truly say has changed my life (along with Siddhartha by Herman Hesse). We were casually thinking about homeschooling, but after reading this book have realized that it really is the only choice for us.But this book isn't only about homeschooling. It is also an approach to parenting and life that embraces awareness, passion, and respect. I am finding that not only am I paying more attention to our children's interests and thinking about how I can turn each moment into a learning experience (either for them or myself), but am also paying more attention to myself and rediscovering my own passions.As we embark on this journey, I am excited for all the things we will each learn individually and as a family."
5,One of the best books I've ever read!,"I wish I could have everyone I know read this book so that we could all talk about it!Seeing the lengths to which Mr. Albert will go to answer a question that his daughter poses -- THAT'S a family education. It's awe-inspring in a world of busy and conflicting schedules and the constant compartmentalization of child/adult themes to see that there are some people that want to learn for a LIFETIME!Congratulations Mr. Albert on a path well chosen. I'd love to have been in Meera's skin when she sat on those Steinway benches! What father routinely follows his childrens' passions that way? Not many!Keep your writing style! I must say I'm bewildered about some comments that you are ""furthering your own agenga, point of view, etc."" Of COURSE you are! It's your book! Whose point of view do most authors further?"
1,Horrible,"Horrible product. I agree with the other reviewer, if I could have gave it 0 stars I would have. Mine not only was light weight, the pedals actually could only be attached backward-I will never buy another product from this company. I couldn't even sell it at a yard sale."
3,Portable Mini Exercise Bike - Blue,"The bike is very good for very light exercise. I increased the resistence, and within 10 minutes the rubber got burned, and right now I am using it without resistence.Need a little more sturdiness."
5,This album RULES,"This album rules, and i should know, since i'm in the band. I play guitar.The singing is really good, but the guitar playing is really awesome. It sounds so sweet. Every note is correct! Here is a quote from my 'zine:""If one is supposed to treat a guitar like a gorgeous woman, than listening to High Strangess is to hear Dave Rich ravage that woman's body again and again.""Buy this record!-dave rich"
5,seriously - you can count on it,"a great (greatest) (current) band from akron ohio, seen 'em live in cleveland & surrounding areas countless times, finally they have a ""real"" disc out! and recorded and whatever else by Pat Carney from the other famous akron rock group the Black Keys! if thats not enough hype, just listen to the disc and all other questions will be answered. think early REM, the Feelies, the Smiths (but faster and less andro), GBV, etc so on and so forth. yet not like any of those bands either. can't recommend this enough. i still rock my cdrs i bought from the band in the past coupla years, but these are more ""polished"" ""tighter"" versions, and some n00bs too. get this while you can. don't be the last on your block to ""discover"" what ""the heart of it all"" is up to, duh!"
2,A hodgepodge of interesting facts with no organization,"While this book collects a number of intriguing tales of the Civil War, the lack of a cohesive sense of chronology or organization makes it nothing more than a more detailed Ripley's Believe it or not. While well-researched, it is not very useful as reference material. However if you are looking for some decidedly different tales of the Civil War and don't care about the skewed sense of time , this book is probably worth the trouble."
1,"Sharper Image YW631 5-in-1 radio/siren/light, etc.","Nice unit, as far as it goes, which isn't far. The volume control knobcame unfastened from the volume control on the chassis and there's no wayto get inside to fix it except complete disassembly which looks like amajor undertaking. What's worse is that Sharper Image has told me that since they don't handle the unit any longer there's nothing they can doto either fix or replace it. They actually told me to take it to anelectronics shop. I think the real problem is that I got the thing as agift and therefore don't have a receipt for it so they're hoping I'll justgo away. Well, go away I will -- permanently -- from Sharper Image andtheir lousy customer service."
1,Nonexistent Customer Service,"Downloaded the trial version, then tried to buy the full version. They took my money, of course, but still get the trial version when I run the program.On top of it all, there is almost no difference between this and version 2004. If you have 2004, don't waste your time and money."
4,Repurchased Item,I love the Hoyle Casino series much cheaper than traveling to my local casino and spending real money. The product itself took a little work after install to get the voice to work with the players but afterwards we have been enjoying without a problem.
1,""" Don't Waste Your money""",It seems that person you play never wins. The so called not real people playing in the game win 99.9% of the time. And the slots keep sucking in your money until your broke. In 5 card draw poker you get the same cards like 2345K or 6789Q 78910A over and over again and when you bet and draw cards you get nothing to make a winning hand 99.9% of the time. The same with 7 card stud.I have played these games at lest 150 times and won only about 10 times. This game is going in the trash!
2,Boring,I played this when I first got it and haven't touched it since. It's not a typical casino game
3,"No Crashes, Great Fun","I bought this game four days ago, and I have been playing it all the time. I do have the 2004 version and it is similar, however it is still fun. I don't know what type of computer other people that have had problems are using, but the game hasn't crashed once for me, and I have been in the texas hold em' tournament. The game is a lot of fun, without going to an casino and spending all of your money."
1,Lousy,"I bought an older version of this game 4 years ago, guess what? same game and not even a glimps of anything new. Its exactly the same graphics, same layout, same games. Purely a rippoff for those thinking they actualy tried to do anything with it over the years. If you own the 2002 version, nothings changed, and I MEAN nothing.JR"
3,Great Fun - but buggy and crashes,"I purchased the game 2 days ago and have been using it on a Pentium II 300 MHz Windows 98 PC, and a Pentium III 700 MHz Windows XP, SP2 PC, and it has been crashing on both - 2-3 times a day - usually when I am in the finals of a Texas HoldEm tournament !!! Damned buggy software.A lot of other people have had issues with this game crashing as well, for example:<a href=""http://forums.encoreusa.com/tm.asp?m=9776"">http://forums.encoreusa.com/tm.asp?m=9776</a>Moose<a href=""http://move.to/moose"">Mooses Software Valley</a>"
3,Fun Game,"I purchased this game 1 week ago - While in the Poker Tournament, it kept crashing. I turned off the background music and it hasn't had a problem since. I am having a great time learning the different games. There needs to be more speaking opponents and more comments. It gets boring hearing the same thing over and over. All in all it is a good game."
2,Hoyle Casino 2006,"It is almost the same as Casino 2004. The charecters are the same and they say the same things. There is no intro and they don't serve drinks. There are a few new games, but most of them are the same. It could have been much better."
2,Rampantly Over-Sexed,"Wow, if I wanted to read a titillating seduction scene between a hooker and a Player, this would be the book! However, I really wanted to read a historical mystery. The departure to ""sex everywhere"" in this book came as quite a surprise; I can only hope Frazer has gotten it out of her system now. The ""mystery"" was easily figured out, before the book was halfway read. I suppose if one is intent on bringing all the old legends back to life, this may be included; I found it not at all to my taste. It looked like a foray into soft porn."
5,A FRUITY FRAGRANCE ENRICHED WITH PEONY AND VIOLET,"It's upbeat, sensuous, and full of life. Live, the latest fragrance from Jennifer Lopez is as zesty as the actress herself - it attracts with notes of Sicilian lemon, Italian orange and pineapple. This delicious fruity concoction is enriched with Peony and Violet to produce a totally feminine yet mysterious scent.The bottle? It's a knock-out as light catches the flashes of purple, yellow and green, all glowing over the rounded glass flacon. It is topped by a spherical green cap above a metallic purple collar. You'll want to keep the bottle long after the fragrance is gone.If you like a scent that is different, makes an impression, this is it. It's also available in shower gel and body lotion for a total Live experience."
1,"Apparently a great product, really can't say...","This looks like a great product. I really can't say because it doesn't fit our vehicle. Amazon says ""Attaches to any spare tire using a heavy duty mounting plate"". Not true. It does not fit our 2007 RAV-4. Called the company and they are aware of this. I would be sure to check with Surco before buying this product. It looks like a really good product and I wish it would have worked on our vehicle."
3,Surco BT300,"The Spare Tire Mount Bike Rack seems durable and holds our two bikes satisfactory. Keeps them sufficiently and firmly in position and far enough apart so they don't rub or scratch against each other - with three bikes, I assume that they would be too close. The double bolt lock downs seem excessivly long and tedious to install."
4,BT300 good but bad fit,"I like the rack but when buying it the reveiw I read said it wouldn't fit a 2010 Rav4. I Looked but didn't see any earlier years so I bought it. Of course it didn't fit my 2006. I called GoFastparts.com, who Amazon is selling the rack for, and was told they charge 20%restocking fee and wouldn't pay for shipping. I am to say the least unhappy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not for Toyota RAV 4,"Found this rack in a search for 2-bike racks for spare tie mount on a RAV 4 (2010). Unfortunately, the RAV 4 has a flange within the mounting bolt pattern for the spare tire which prevents the mounting bracket from sitting flush as it must to work. Went to Thule instead, where there is a rack that has been modified to accomodate the flange."
3,Won't fit on 2007 RAV4,"Arrived on time and well packaged. Seemed sturdy and strong. Despite the Amazon description, this unit will not fit on 2007 RAV4, for which there is a non-standard sized ""tongue"" supporting the spare tire. Surco customer support was helpful."
4,Great Bike Rack,"We've had this bike rack for about a month now and it works great. It was easy to install and once mounted both our bikes (we own 2) fit snuggly and securely with no wobble or movement. The mounting arm comes off easily and the spare tire cover fits over the bracket. Some reviewers with vehicles like the RAV4 that have hard spare tire covers had problems getting them to fit, however, ours is a soft cover and fits fine. I'd definitely recommend this bike rack to anyone with the right vehicle."
5,Fits great for Jeep wrangler 07,"Bought this for our 07 Wrangler. When installing it the plate that goes behind the spare seemed to sit a bit free for my liking, put the spare back on and bolt up and it is snug and had no movement.We had a little issue where the weld holding the nut to lock in the main bike frame has a little spill over but with a little working the main frame slid on correctly, sits snug and holds the bikes great. there is almost no movement and best of all the rack is lockable to the vehicle and lockable to hold the bikes in.Very satisfied customer and would recomend to any wrangler owner out there."
1,will not work on Toyota rav 4 2011,will not fit a toyota rav 4. very disappointing. Trying to attach to back of my rav4 the night before a bike trip.
4,Funny and Functional,"I purchased this item for my husband. It really is cute, but works well too. It has become his ""Best Buddy"" and now I don't have to scratch his back all the time!"
1,Great customer service,"Just wanted to say that this company puts customer satisfaction first and for that I am grateful. Although I was disappointed with the quality of this product (it's more a novelty than a functional back scratcher), I would order from this company again."
2,It's just ok...,"I was suprised with how fast the ""scrather thorns"" came out.. Granted I have a 4 year old that was checking it out... the prickly parts were almost all out within a few weeks... :( It felt great while they were still in there."
3,Seller is Great but product is not!,"Ships fast everything came as described but this product did not work well for me and has nothing to do with the seller it's the product! It actually works well for a couple weeks but it is not made to last, and if someone says it does they must have skin delicate as a mole rat! If you are a hard working Man and are average build or bigger I wouldn't waste your money!!"
2,Not as advertised,"Product not as advertised, not as pictured. ""Bristles"" were long, soft strips of plastic that couldn't dust your furniture, let alone scratch an itch. And, I had to pay the postage to return it. Got the mailing label for nothing, though...woo-hoo. Worthless."
2,I shoulda listened to the negative reviews.,"I debated as to whether to buy this or not based on the 20 existing reviews. Some said its great, some said its not. So I decided to take a chance that it would be a good scratcher in addition to the obvious cuteness factor. WRONG. The bristles are just soft vinyl with no strength to them. They are suitable for decoration only. This thing is ineffective as a back scratcher and suitable only as a conversation piece or for bonking the dog on the butt when he misbehaves. Now, do I waste money sending it back?"
3,"Cute, not so scratchy",Very cute back scratcher w/ real cactus look and accesories. Not very much scratch factor. Great gift for someone who loves southwest look.
5,My son loves it,My son had shoulder surgery and really wanted a back scratcher. He loves it and says it works great. It's comical and functional.
5,Great little book!,"I love this little book. It's full of some fun and delicious egg recipes. There are rustic, homey (country) recipes and fancier (city) recipes. If you love eggs and need some ideas for easy meals, get this book. I love it."
5,INTERESTING --- FULL OF IDEAS !!,"THE DIRECTIONS ARE SOOOO EASY TO FOLLOW, AND THE TASTES REALLY VARY. I LOVE THE HUEVOS, WHICH ARE LIGHTER, BUT STILL TASTY. THE MASHED POTATO BAKED EGG HAS ALL THE TASTES I LOVE --EXCEPT I COOK THE RAMEKINS TO BROWN THE POTATOES FIRST. I SPRINKLE WITH COOKED, DICED BACON AND THEN ADD THE EGG. HOWEVER YOU FIX IT, IT'S WONDERFUL !! THIS COOKBOOK INSPIRES ME TO ADD MY OWN IDEAS. BUT THE ORIGINALS ARE INCREDIBLE."
1,Finalizing and editing,"We have this camera at our work site. It takes fairly good pictures/video. The biggest complaint I have is the same as others here: Finalizing a disc is very unclear, and the format used in VR mode is not very user friendly.However, thanks to the interwebs, I will tell you how to do these; seeing as Canon can't.To finalize a DVD, you need to be in ""Play"" mode and the Camera must be PLUGGED in to an electrical outlet. (Very lame IMHO)If you want to be able to use your videos, shoot in video mode, not VR. Yes this limits your option to edit the video on your camera, but it makes the discs compatible and easily finalized into a format readable by your DVD player/computer."
2,It's Not Worth the Money,"My daughter received this camcorder for Christmas. Thank goodness we tried to play the mini DVD in the computer before we left to return home. That's when we read the instruction manual and found that it needed to be finalized before we could view it. I planned to make 3 copies when I returned home, and return the mini DVD to my daughter to reuse. Was I ever wrong! After trying to make a copy and trying different software, I finally searched for a solution to find out that this VRO format is next to impossible to copy or edit on your home computer.If you just want a point and shoot camcorder and don't plan on making copies for family and friends, this might be for you, but if you want to edit or distribute your copies, buy a different camcorder.The only thing I'm happy about is that I wasn't the one to buy this camcorder for my daughter."
1,Most useless camcorder out there,"We bought this for basic use only. Within 9 months it wouldn't finalize our discs of our new baby. We sent it back at our expense. The company replaced it's organs and returned it. Six weeks later it won't work again and the company wants us to ship it back at our expense again to work on it some more. Again, our baby's precious moments are lost because it won't play on DVD without finalizing the discs. The company won't just replace the camcorder they will only fix it even though it keeps failing. Horrible camcorder, horrible company. Don't recommend a Canon or this particular DVD camcorder."
2,Ok writing,I chose this because there were a lot of parts that were flat and only a few that were interesting
1,This book,This book is BORING. I found myself forcing myself to read it for a school project. My advise: Don't Read It.
2,Not cool at this price!,"Since the price is Sony's own list price, you can find it cheaper at many online stores. The product itself is fine. The price is the problem."
4,Pricey but solid performance,"I was first peeved about having to but stuck with a predetermined Sony memory stick format. But after continued use in TRV900, TRV11 video cams and the Sony Clie PDA- I have to say I'm very happy with the memory stick's flexibility. I usually hate being stuck in a specific company format, but at least Sony did it right.The transfer rate in the Clie is very rapid. Backing up the entire contents of the Clie takes literally a few seconds. The Clie has a program that allows you RUN programs off of the memory stick. This is not the fastest operating speed, but it is no worse than a Zip drive disk.The size and reliability is unbeatable. Compared to a San memory card that has lost it's life after 1 year, the Sony memory sticks have performed flawlessly for pics, data, and application runs. Go for the 32+ MB and up - just like a hard drive, you think a realistic amount is adequate. But once you start shooting and using, you'll wish you upgraded for the bigger stick."
5,Amazing game,"This game is the sole reason I still own a Sega Saturn. This was the first console I purchased with my own money, back when it was first released. I bought Myst and this together, and they are still 2 of my favorites. People talk about how outdated the graphics are, but seriously, how many games have over 200 people on the screen at the same time? Unless ya get into AOE (and I do...) those are stats that still hold up today. I happen to be a fan of sprite based graphics, so they dont bother me at all. The gameplay is killer! You owe it to yourself to buy this game. Anyone who owns a xbox360 has UNDOUBTEDLY spent $60 on games that are absolutely horrible. I've done it so many times that I stopped buying em before I had a chance to rent them. Current systems suffer from poor games with good graphics. Spend your hard earned money on a GREAT game with subpar graphics. You wont be disappointed."
5,One of the Best Games Ever!!!,"I had been watching historical Korean Dramas with my wife before buying the game. It was Jumong that reminded me of playing Dragon Force when I was younger. I asked my wife if I could buy the game, guys remember to always ask your wife for permission so as not to start any arguments.Now as for the review of the game. The game is AMAZING!!!The story is top rate of having to conquer the continent to save it. It is really good to improve strategy, like chess with a really good story. Study the manual first to learn which type of fighter is better against certain types. Whats really cool is when you have a few men against many and you're able to win the battle. If you love a good story and a great strategy rpg, then get Dragon Force.P.S. Guys, make sure you ask permission from your wife whenever you play the game, so as not to get in trouble and to prevent you from playing too long."
4,An exciting and unique game!,"A real great video game. Too bad it was overlooked when it came out, cause back then ""rpg"" games were considerd nerdy;but this one is truly a rare gem. I take off a star because as great of a game this is, your probably not going to find this game less than $60.00 anywhere, and that may not even include case and manual. Still, a great game non-the-less and if your a fan of ""rpg"" this is a must have."
2,Bumper,"THERE ISN'T A MOUNTING KIT. I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE MULTIPLE TIMES. THEY SENT ME ANOTHER BUMPER!! NOTHING IN IT. IT'S FALSE ADVERTISING AND BECAUSE OF AMAZONS DISTRIBUTORS CUSTOMER SERVICE CAN'T DO ANYTHING. I'VE GROWN TIRED OF HASSLING WITH 70 POUND BUMPERS VERY MUCH SO. I'LL NEVER BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM AMAZON, AND I'VE ALREADY ADVISED MANY OF MY FRIENDS THE SAME. It's a good price but that's the only good thing about it."
5,"Awesome, refreshing....a must have!","When I first heard ""What I really meant to say"" it brought out so many emotions in me. I could totally relate to the song. Cyndi has a unique, beautiful voice and I knew I had to buy the CD the day it came out. There is nothing like a CD full of songs you can relate to, and that is what you get with CD. It's amazing! Cyndie wrote almost all the songs, and you get to go on her journey. The lyrics are real and full of emotions everyone can relate to. She will be a star in country music and you will know why when you listen to the CD."
2,Don't talk -- just sing,"I'm torn in believing that anyone can have such a ""twangy"" voice. It smooths out on some of the songs (those seem to be the ones everyone likes)but talk about annoying for the rest of the cd when she talks. This is the first cd I've bought of Cyndi's...and there is hope for better work ahead. I'm not a fan yet, but I think I could be if she settles into her own style. She just seems so fake in her speech patterns I have a hard time listening to much of the cd. The potential is there so I'll keep an ear open for more of her work."
5,Welcome to Cyndi's World,"Cyndi Thomson hails from Georgia, and brings a certain element to country music which is both intriguing and interesting. She has a really beautiful voice, and she wrote most of the material on her debut album, MY WORLD. The album has a simplistic approach to it, with some honest delivered lyrics that anyone can relate to. The first single ""What I Really Meant To Say"" is the harsh reality that someone you once loved has moved on, and you just wanted to tell them you still love them instead you pretend your ok. ""If You Could Only See"" is such an inspirational ballad which Cyndi just shines on. ""I Always Liked That Best"" is a bittersweet song about remembering the love once shared. The new single ""I'm Gone"" (written by Kim Richey) is a tongue in cheek anthem which just shines. Other highlights include ""I'll Be Seeing You"", ""There Goes The Boy"", ""But I want To"", and more. Give Cyndi's debut a try!"
3,Smug Look Smeared Across Your Face,"I picked this CD up at a garage sale for a buck. Never having heard of Cyndi Thomson, somehow I thought this was a Christian album. I keep waiting for her to sing about Jesus until I figured out that she's just singing country. My favorite track is the one penned by Kim Richey & Chuck Prophet, ""I'm Gone,"" with its smash chorus and Thomson's vocals delivering the sonic payload, ""Yeah, you there with that smug look smeared across your face, That's right, I've got better things to do than hang around this place."" ""Hope You're Doing Fine"" is quite pleasant. ""I Always Liked That Best"" & ""What I Really Meant to Say"" also have a nice energy. Many of the other tunes seem to blend together for me. The DVD presentation was more irritating that enlightening. I really didn't need to meet her sisters or best friend. Why put that on a CD? It's probably a blessing that she gave up her singing career. Others like Jessi Alexander & Tift Merritt eclipse her for originality. Enjoy!"
1,What's All the Hype???,"How disappointing! I expected so much more. The whole CD (and her accompanying marketing) is an attempt to sell sex under the guise of musical talent. Mistakenly, I was impressed after reading on her website that she didn't want to give young girls the impression she was having sex. Imagine my surprise when the CD comes, to hear her seductively purr in detail about what a hot little number she is throughout the album. It's hard to find music these days with a decent message, and without a self-serving agenda. True talent doesn't have to rely on all the sexy trappings to get recognition. I'm embarrassed for her!"
2,The Dragon Hour,"Well, after reading her acknowledgements in the front, I was thrilled to see author Diana Gibaldon listed. I was really expecting a book that would catch me at the first page, even second or third. I thought that her time travel aspect was vague along with the actual discription of graphics. I never really understood most of her discriptive writting regarding surroundings and action. The idea behind the story was good. I just wish it was more intriguingly developed. Maybe next time."
2,Not a great read for me,I didn't care for it. I didn't connect with the characters. I thought it was like reading an episode of Beauty and the Beast from the TV show a few years ago. The world they (and all the other inhabitants) lived in and had to save.
1,worse racing game ever!!!,"You cant make sharp turnsGraphics have no improvement over the 3do gameit looks like most of the money and effort went into the cars and copyright spendingsave ur moneyget Daytona usa, that game rocks"
1,Really,I heard this movie was bad and I thought it had to do with the type of humor in the movie. After watching this I realize this is one of the worst movies ever made. This was over the top disgusting and I feel like I lost something that I can never get back. At least an hour and a half of my life wasted....Good Luck if you choose to watch this garbage. I would recomend looking at a wall for an hour and a half instead because it will have more value and you might think through some of your own issues and be a better person.
1,worse movie of all time!!!,"There are five funny jokes, matbe, in this movie. It could have been awesom, but it fell limp!!! RUN FROM THIS MOVIE AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!! I FEEL LIKE I LOST 20 IQ POINTS FROM SETTING THROUGH THE WHOLE PIECE OF ****!!!"
1,Pretty horrible movie,"I thought this movie would be funny but I found myself bored after the first 15 minutes, and then some really crude humor. I skimmed through the movie and there was very crude humor throughout, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone under the age of 21."
4,Hilarious and Completely Silly,"This movie is great! Non-stop laughter in both outrageous moments and the subtleties. Ryan Philippe plays a great straight man as ""Piper"" to Macgruber's ridiculous antics."
3,audience specific,"i enjoyed this movie, however most people i know dont. you will either love it or wish you could get the hr and a half of ur life back. no middle ground"
1,"Weak, don't bother","One of the dumbest movies ever. Even for something that is supposed to be a comedy/parody, pretty disappointing. Waste of my free credit."
1,I expected dumb this was more than I could handle,"Dumb, I expect dumb and I like a lot of dumb movies but this one was moronic."
1,Worst Movie of the Decade,"I was expecting stupid humor and normally that would have been OK, but this just wansn't funny and being prepared for a stupid movie doesn't prepare you for MacGruber. This is probably the worst movie to ever come out of Hollywood, and certainly the worst movie of the decade. Ryan Phillippe and Val Kilmer should be ashamed."
1,its way to lame,SNL used to have the best skits that turned into great movies like coneheads but this movie pushed them into a tragic twist of lame comedy that maybee a 3 year old might get and still only laugh if he was drugged before watching it.
4,Sick but funny,"I didn't know how these fools could make something worthwhile with such a flimsy premise (mocking the 80s show MacGyver), but Will FOrte is pretty funny (and a sick little puppy by the way) and Kristin Wiig is classic as well as Hooooot. It's not Fletch or anything, but it's pretty good pickup."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,The plot laks imagination as does the acting. I don't think I can say much good about any part of it. I guess that is why it didn't last long in the theaters.
1,The worst movie I've ever tried to watch!!,"Nancy, my companion, had heard somewhere that this movie was one of the funniest movies ever made. Since we both always enjoyed MacGyver, I was excited when this became available. I REALLY wanted to like it....Nanc REALLY expected to love it...and we both could hardly stomach more than 50 minutes of it!I cannot stress enough how moronic and idiotic this movie is...I wish I could have back the hour I spent watching it!Thowing ""F"" bombs around is not enough to make something funny. Pathetic and crude isn't funny either.AVOID AT ALL COST!"
1,Really really bad,"Juvenile, crude humor can be funny. Or, it can be MacGruber.TERRIBLE. Stay away. I would bet that you could think of at least 100 more profitable things to do with your time than watch this movie.I'm not being snobby or old. It's just really bad."
1,Worst ever.,"Watched as many minutes as I could stomach, didn't enjoy any of them. I would have given it zero stars, but that wasn't an option. Thought a spoof on the old TV show had lots of potential, but obviously not in the hands of this cast, this director and these writers. If it was at a movie theatre, I would have asked for my money back, and still trying to figure out how to ask that of Amazon. It doesn't need a rating, it needs a warning."
1,sucks,"This movie is amazingly awful. I have attempted to watch it twice and have been disappointed both times. Will forte apparently wants to be Will ferrell with the way he acts sometimes.I know it's supposed to be over done but the manner that it's done is not convincing the actors are horrible especially for this to be a spoof. Macgruber is ok on SNL but as a movie it just completely fails. This movie is really not good at all, see it once and never again."
1,Someone out there really hates MacGyver,"I love a good parody and a wry sense of humor. Top Gun had it, as did Airplane, and The Princess Bride. MacGruber didn't have any charm, humor, or ironic giggles in it. In fact, MacGruber was painful to watch, as well as disgusting. All I could think while I hoped it would get better was the writers must have absolutely hated MacGyver.Bad acting, too much gratuitous male nudity, and outright stupidity made me shut it off."
3,I WANT A REFUND!!!,This movie was disgusting! It was just down right gross! It wasn't even funny! The one minute sketches on SNL are better then this. I was bored out of my mind while watching this at the theater. I only stayed and watched the entire movie because it cost so much! A couple that was in the theater with me actually got up and walked out! I wish I could have got a refund after watching this movie! Can't wait for the DVD release so I can buy it!!!
3,"Another Overlong SNL Skit, But Funnier Than Most","MacGruber is another movie based on a Saturday Night Live skit. And I'd say it's the best since Wayne's World. That's not to say that it's great. It takes a while for MacGruber to find its groove. It starts off kind of dull, but it gets funnier and better as it goes along. And it even has some surprisingly violent action sequences. Almost four stars out of five. Almost."
2,Not as good as the SNL skits,Concept was just not good enough for a full length movie. There was no character development and no developed story.
2,Not So Funny Spoof,I do not know where the other reviewers thought this movie was even remotely funny. Just alot of backwoods gag B.S. The slap stick wasn't even that good. It started to get a little funny near the end and the acting was horrible even for a spoof comedy. The Scary Movie Series was better then this piece of garbage.
5,expect dumb and you will receive hilarious,"This type of comedy is along the same lines as dumb and dumber. Its a movie you need to expect that it is going to be dumb. If you do that, then this movie will be hilarious."
3,MACGROSS,"The movie starts out like a Zucker and Zucker five star Rambo spoof. The dialogue was witty and quick. MacGruber is coaxed out of retirement to assemble a team to fight his arch rival. All is well, then we find out MacGruber is a complete idiot, as he accidentally blows up his own team. At this point the movie digresses to become outright gross. In the next scene he is very graphically asking to perform oral and anal sex with an army officer in order to coax him to join his new team. This scene was completely disgusting, poorly written, and totally needless. The next real highlight was the sex scene. This was laugh out loud funny, but didn't carry the movie. Much of the movie is crude and sophomoric. Sometimes it works well, while other times it works as well as a bad National Lampoon movie. Disgusting is not always funny.Not for kids or prudes. Did Val Kilmer get fat or what?"
5,Macgruber!,"Love this movie! Case was a little cracked on the inside when it arrives, so I was nervous the DVD was scratched, but luckily it was fine. Arrived quickly."
1,Kindle edition missing chunks of text,"This is not a review of the book but of the Kindle edition format by Digireads.com (2004). From about a third of the way into the book it appears to be missing pieces of text of various lengths, from posssibly a few words or a line to possibly more -- it is hard to tell without another edition to hand. It happens often enough to be annoying.[I did buy the book from Amazon, via another account.]"
5,Wells builds novels out of ideas!,"Mr. Wells builds novels out of ideas as other men build them of imagery and emotions. William Porphyry Benham sets out to live the noble or aristocratic life, and the book is about what happens to him because of his beautiful obsession. Starting in his boyhood, and throughout his life, it produced profound adventures, yet also made him ridiculous, and even inspiring. It was a passion for courage, for personal nobility, for service to others, for self-sacrificing, all for the social betterment of the whole world."
4,Great fun!,"A review by Bill Fisher, Victory Music Review, June, 2001 -When the ""& Friends"" include the likes of Bryan Bowers, Peter Ostroushko, Dean Magraw and mandolin whiz Radim Zenkl, what you get is the feel of a bunch of superb pickers gathered around a microphone or two in someone's living room with the fire crackling in the woodstove....A remarkably listenable set with wonderful mandolin, banjo and (of course) autoharp licks abounding and even a few odd fragments of instrumentals from Zenkl and Bowers. This is not the sort of CD you'd be unhappy about hearing frequently on your children's boom boxes. In fact, what a glorious replacement for the Barney and Elmo music that makes you feel guiltily genocidal. In the end, this music is great fun, reflecting the pleasures that clearly went into its creation. And, for that, we give thanks!"
5,Very entertaining,"Very entertaining action-packed movies. The ""file"" packaging is clever marketing. We enjoyed the extras provided on disk 3 which included interesting pieces featuring author Robert Ludlum. Looking forward to The Bourne Ultimatum."
3,Bourne Ultimatum is not included...,"I thought i was careful to read between the lines, but did not check the release date of this collection. The 3 disc collection can be misleading. The 3rd disc is just commentary."
3,Lost,then the product finally came after being shipped twice and was not in new conition as promised the back cover was torn off
1,The Bourne Identity,The product was pretty bad. It skipped several times on the DVD. The total viewing time lost is around 30 minutes. Not good.
1,Poor product quality,Probably an OK movie.Except that Amazon sub-contracted a third party to provide this movie. It was poorly packaged and damaged in shipping.However that probaly would not have mattered because the disk was covered with glue.Please do not send factory rejects as saleable merchandise.
2,one of the dvd is defected,"there are 2 dvd in this package, but when we open it, one of the dvd is defected, can't play it, but itsnot worth to send it back, so I need to buy another one."
4,Action Pack,This was a really good series. Love how it gets you thinking about how things happen. I stopped at the three. When they changed actors I didn't watch anymore of the series.
5,Great entertainment!,"Excellent theater. The plot demands that you suspend disbelief, then takes you on a really wild ride."
5,A Helping Hand,"This is an excellent presentation of the seven pieces. I especially enjoyed learning Tarrega's ""Adelita"" and Bach's ""Sarabande"". Hand offers some views on interpretation and ornamentation as well, such as his discussion on the traditional baroque approach to Bach vs. his more romantic approach for the guitar. I would recommend buying his other DVD first, ""Classical Guitar: Technique & Musicianship"" in order to lay some groundwork for these pieces as they are not for the novice. Hand is one of the best classical guitarists in the world, and is gifted as an instructor as well which isn't always the case with great musicians. Between these two videos and the accompanying sheet music any intermediate level (which includes the ability to read music) fingerstyle guitarist should be able to become proficient in beginning to intermediate level classical guitar repertoire. Highly recommended."
3,"OK, but save your money","Any aspiring guitarist can benefit some from watching and listening to Hand, but this DVD could be much better. Video quality is poor, and Hand does not provide enough technical details on what to do or not to do to improve your performance. Basically, he just plays the pieces, with some commentary."
2,"good violence, but movie ends very badly","Nice touch, but this movie ends up very bad, had a promising beggining. Bad cg effects, bad script, nice looking sabretooths though.So please if you dont like to be dissapointed, please rent this movie and dont, ever, ever buy it......"
1,Oh the Humanity!,"I have very little to say about this waste of time except that it features perhaps the worst Special Effects shot I have ever seen. Watch for it at the end when the park owner is under the faux sabretooth statue thing on top of the gift shop. WOW!One other note, it is mentioned that the sabretooths are ""bulimic"" because they can't keep their food down. A)they seem pretty healthy as they kill with wild abandon, including decapitations B) isn't bulima more of a psychological disorder rather than a physical by product of cloning? Or are the sabretooths (Sabreteeth?) embarrased by their body image and force themselves into the ""binge and purge"" cycle?"
1,"Let's think of how cool this could've been, and mourn for the wasted coolness.","The Sci-Fi Channel should change their name to the Wasted Potential Channel. Attack of the Sabretooth continues their tradition of making cool premises into movies that really suck. In this low-grade Jurassic Park rip-off, we're treated to effects that range from Mediocore to Game Boy Pocket level, bad acting, a weak script, and bland directing.Let's not forget that the Sabretooths are hardly in this mess. This is s sequel to a film simply entitled Sabretooth. Ther was only one Sabretooth Tiger there, and it still got more screen time than the three in this one. It aslo didn't look as fake.Skip Attack Of The Sabretooth unless you hate yourself. Do you hate yourself? No? Then stay away from this garbage."
4,Delightful...,"...is the word that suits. The last time I remember feeling this was after listening to Bim Sherman and his mega-mystuc approach to an acoustic sort of the reggae variety. Los Yerberos is full of that freshness, and having had the chance to watch them live I can tell you that the album does justice to their sound. They evidently master roots sound but instead of pretending.. (was that called Rastitute?) to be what they aren't, offer us a delightful chilly blend of Mexican Culture burning in the same spirit. An essential in any serious world music collection."
4,Gets job done,"This is good for occasional use, but I would probably go with something a little higher quality if you plan to use this daily in your kitchen. The display is nice in that you can adjust the ""0"" mark for additional weight (ex. you can adjust for the weight of your bowl, so that your weight for the ingredient is accurate). The dial can be a little flimsy, so you might want to weigh a couple of times in order to make sure you have it right.Overall, I would probably buy it again if I had to. But like I said, I use this on and off (as needed) - maybe once a week tops. So, this serves me well.Pros: Adjustable dial for weight of plate/bowl, light weight, very do-able price.Cons: Plastic all around, dial can be somewhat flimsy."
5,"Ah, This Brings Me Back!","I remember growing up in the 80's and 90's, going to the deli and raising my confidence level by kicking the crap out of the ""Street Fighter 2"" characters. After buying the X-Arcade, It reminded me of those days. My wife thinks I'm nuts (for different reasons), but there's nothing in gaming quite like the feel of a real arcade stick and buttons.This thing rocks!!!"
4,My son asked to watch this again...,"I was tempted to order it on Amazon due to positive comments from other users and went to Youtube to look at a 3 min clip that someone has uploaded (The Balloon song) and heard Wai Lana's voice which I agree was kind of creepy...so I decided not to get it. Then I came across a copy which was on sale at a local store and got it at around US$2 thinking that I had nothing to lose. Went home, showed it to my two and a half year old boy, and he was fascinated and watched the whole video without stopping. I then forgot about it and a couple days later, he asked to watch the ""yoga"" tape again! I was surprised. I realize that though Wai Lana's English is accented, her voice is actually quite soothing which relaxed me and probably my son."
4,"Odd at first, but then good.","My daughter loves doing Wai Lana's Yoga, At first, I thought Wai Lana was a little scary, weird make up and strange voice, but I'm over it."
1,yawn,Our children completely lost interest in this DVD within the first 5 minutes. Wai Lana is actually kind of creepy and speaks soooo slowly--it's like she's on some kind of drug. There are much better yoga DVD's out there for young children--this DVD doesn't seem to be very motivating at all.
4,"Only one good song on it, but boy is it good.","I bought this cd solely because it had the song 'Shenendoah'. They have the best rendition I have ever heard, however, the other songs are much less than extraordinary."
5,Classic,"This is one of the greatest unheralded albums ever released.Brilliantly arranged and produced by the legendary Jeff Lynne and fabulous natural vocals from Julianna Raye this album still ranks as one of my favourite albums of all time.Standouts include Limbo,Something Peculiar and Tell Me I'm Alright. If you like great pop music you'll love this.They need to remaster and release it with bonus tracks as Jeff Lynne recorded 16 tracks in all with Julianna Raye.We can only hope."
3,Not what I was hoping for...,"THE ABCs OF HANDWRITING ANALYSIS was all right if it's your first book, but I was disappointed. The info was too general, for me."
4,Terrific gift.,My brother's hobby is handwriting analysis. I purchased this as well as one other book and sent them to him for his birthday. He was very pleased and is enjoying them very much.
2,"Easy to use, but...","I'm not impressed at all with this camera. It's alright for the price and all, but without an A/C adapter it really drains the batteries. It would have been nice to have one. It is fairly easy to use though and is a good beginner digital camera if you have the money to constantly replace the (4) AA batteries after just a couple sessions."
2,Digital Brownie Hawkeye,"I bought this primarily for eBay auctions. It performs adequately, but ""battery hungry"" is this camera's middle name. Battery life is about three hours total, a bit longer if you avoid using the display and flash. It does take good pictures, but only with sufficient ambient light. The flash tends to wash out the image, and the red eye feature is useless. I was told you can't get a really decent camera for under $150, and that is apparently true. I bought a cheap camera, and that's what I got."
4,Very Good Book,"This Book in one of the best book, I cleared my PMP exam with this book, the way I prepared was read PMBOK and read this book side by side. Sample Questions are very good."
3,Great Introductory Book Only,"When I read through the PMBOK, I found it hard to read. After reading this book, it explained things in a clear and simple way in how to apply each topic. YET, the test questions were very easy. I found Rita Mulcahy's book had more difficult questions more geared toward the exam. So, I read both books and got a firm understanding of the topics."
3,This good book has a potential of being a great book.,"I am glad that I bought this book for preparing for my PMP exam.Having studied this book, some sections of this book need more clarification on the topic being discussed in that section.In some areas of the book there is a ""break"" in continuity of thoughts.First time readers may have difficulty digesting some concepts that seemingly are conflicting when cross-reference in different parts of the same book.I definitely recommend this book to anyone wanting to work towards their PMP certification.-NS."
4,cheap at first,"I bought this product for my artwork. The price was good and it had free shipping. The problem is the refills, They cost a small fortune. Ten tiny erasers almost cost as much as the machine itself. The other brands cost more at first but the refills are a fraction of the cost. So in the long run it might cost more to own this machine."
5,Perfect for what it says it is,"I do a lot of work with pencil at my desk - including 2.0 mm pencil, which leaves a heavy imprint. While visiting my dad, I saw he had one of these - and I ordered one right then and there. It definitely doesn't disappoint! Hold down the button and erase like normal; the pencil marks come right up. I haven't used this long enough to know when battery replacement will be needed, but I wouldn't figure more than once every few months.Very excited about this purchase!"
2,Don't buy this,"It shorted out, started smelling burning plastic, batteries got super hot. Only had this a week. Ridiculous. I don't recommend this, obviously."
4,Great Tool for Drafting & Drawing,"Granddaughter is studying architecure. This tool makes quick work of removing a very fine drawing line. Not a backpack tool, but a great drawing board tool."
5,Good Product!,The Staedtler Battery Operated Eraser was exactly what we were looking for and could not find in a store! It even came with extra erasers!
5,This eraser is great!,"This is one of the best purchases I've made as an artist. I like that comes with several refills right out of the box. the only thing is that the RPM could be better to make it absolutely perfect, but this is really not even a problem if used with an eraser shield to maximize its use. A great alternative to any other high end eraser out there."
4,4 stars because of the price,"Its a pretty good eraser that does a really good job. But its really a bit to much money for what it is. A piece of plastic, a small motor and a switch.Again, it works fine, but you pay a lot for the name Staedler printed on it."
1,Crap,This is a piece of crap. The eraser is made of molded slippery plastic. Hard to hold. The button is recessed and hard to push for those with limited grip.The button should have a lock so it would stay on or use a click on/click off button. I would use my money for a better one. Another made in China junk.
4,Beautiful,The scenery is nice and the short narrative is good. The aerial views make this dvd very worthwhile.
1,Came with a dead battery.,"This was to be a gift but the battery was dead. I bet it would have been funny and maybe worth keeping for myself but since it didn't work I may never know. I sent it back,,there was no replacement option so I opted to not bother trying to buy another one,,,it's really too expensive anyway."
2,Smooth Sax Tribute to Santana,"I bought this CD on impulse. It is Ok to listen to, but I much prefer the orignal music. On many of the tracks the drum machine is over-powering. I'd stick with the orginal music and pass on this CD."
4,Leap 2 Reading : Superman,My son who is almost 4 years old was not interested with his Leap Pad until we bought this book. It is written like a comic book and the leap pad will read all of the words in the story. He really likes the games that go a long with it too even though some are a over his head.
4,Great anthology,"I think I can sum up the book in one word: thorough. At times it's tough to get through, but in the end you realize the book is so useful you can't let it out of your sight."
1,Beware!,TheraCane Instructional Video - TheraCane Instructional VideoFor the most part this dvd is okay. There are other portions that are difficult to see however. I would not waste anymore money on this. It is a good thing that I got the dvd before spending money on the cane. Buyer Beware!!!
2,Instructional CD,The CD illustrated the various ways to use the theracane depending on which part of the body was the focus.I believe it should have illustrated more slowly exactly how to use the cane. To review the section needed the entire CD had to be scanned. Pausing it to absorb each maneuver would have been helpful.
3,Worth $5.00 but no more,"A few good pointers/suggestions on how to use the cane. The presentation was a bit cheesy (the introduction by Bob Anderson of Stretching fame) and too quick for me to keep pace. I had to constantly press the pause button to see what the presenter was doing. The vidio quality is also very dated. It looks like it was made in the 70's. Overall, for 5 bucks or less, I'd recommend it. The Thera Cane therapy tool by the way is awesome. Anyone can figure out how to use it."
3,It is OK,"Neither like nor dis-like this DVD it does give how to videos for the Thera Cane. I have used it but it does not help my back I have bad disc in the neck, middle and low back. It feels good to rub the sore spots."
4,Thera Cane DVD,"My physical therapist recommended the Thera Cane. I also ordered the DVD instructional to go with it. What a wonderful tool for PT at home. Saves money too, no need to go for massages."
3,It was somewhat helpful,"I guess I would buy it again at $5.00, but I wouldn't spend much on this DVD. It was helpful in showing how each of the Thera-cane knobs could be used. But you only need to see it about once or twice. (The Thera-cane is fantastic, though.) If you really want to use the Thera-cane to its best advantage, buy the ""Trigger Point Therapy Workbook"" by Clair Davies, Amber Davies, and David G. Simons. That book and the Thera-cane have given unbelievable relief from many pain problems I had thought I would have to live with the rest of my life."
4,Helpful,"I owned the Theracane for about a year and used it on my back where needed. I did not have any direction, merely used it on sore areas. I watched the DVD and it was helpful to show all the areas of the body that could be worked and the best way to address problems. Worth $5 if you don't want to take the time to read a book but would like to receive the benefits of the product."
2,"A rough overview to Yosemite, but overpriced","This is a schematic pictoral map of Yosemite with trails marked based on difficulty. Each trail is accompanied by a distance and elevation gain, and on the back these are ranked by difficulty and have tick marks for features such as waterfalls, views etc. This is not that different from the free maps that the park visitors centre hands out.Overall this is probably best suited to someone who has never been to Yosemite and doesn't want to use a regular map. On the positive side you could use the map to decide if a hike is within your ability and taste, and to plan and follow the trail. On the other hand the schematic nature makes it hard to work out exactly where the trials go, and what the topography is at any point. Anyone who can read a map would be better off with the Guide to Yosemite High Sierra Trails, which is a proper map and sells for $2.50."
1,Flip Album :(,"The company produces a ""pro"" version, they sell it for more than it's worth, and then they compete with you by plastering their name and links to their website all over the finished Flip Album. So, you produce and try to sell, or even give away a burned copy of your hard work, and they make you look foolish.Their business ethics are questionable."
4,pretty sweet,"sega saturn wasn't known for too many originals but bug! was one of them and it was something of it's own breed...still is. for those who never played this gem..it's a side scroller but one of the funkiest side scrollers you'll ever play..you basically have to go through a maze of awesomeness without dying or falling in a hole. the main character is bug and this is basically like a movie in hollywood..the story that is..thats why they say ""aand action"" each time you start a level..but anyways, the second one was cool...really just as good as the first the only thing really seperating the two is that on this one you can play as different characters..there's bug..some pimp dude, and bugs dog..a catapillar. the enemies are funny and challenging..lots of dung beetles..gotta watch out for them. but again, saga saturn wasn't the best system out there but if you still own one you should buy this game..for realzies. and thats my two cents."
3,"Goodbye, Columbus",I read this book for my english research paper. The book was good while the paper was terrible. Peace
3,"Argghhh, an EDITED dvd version of Goodbye Colulmbus","I loved this film when I first saw it. I must admit to being a fan of Richard Benjamin. I waited and waited for the film to be released on dvd and when it became available, I immediately ordered one. Imagine my HORROR when upon the initial viewing I realized that the studio had released an EDITED version on dvd!! I have never heard of such a thing. All of MacGraw's nude scenes have been severly cut to allow a PG rating as opposed to the original release which had an R rating. I absolutely HATE censorship. I don't care whether the cuts are of sex, violence or simply to shorten a film. I want to see a film as the director wished it to be seen. Is the movie still good? Yes, of course...but this release will always be tainted by the cuts the studio made to attain a wider audience. Shame, shame."
3,Queen For A Day,"I think that I have only seen this movie twice in my entire lifetime and Icould barely remember any of it. So I rented the dvd and I must say that Ireally enjoyed it. Some of the neighborhoods looked familiar(I've lived inthe Bronx for over thirty years)and I would love to know where in the Bronx it was filmed because I love that library!The ending of this film has always left me a bit puzzled; but I would love to have had ""Brenda's"" carefree life for just one day. Seeing this movie really took me back, and I actually found it strange not to see a single cell phone. I hope I passed the audition. Peace."
2,Trivial and Dated,"I remember seeing this movie in the late 1960's and thought it a decent comedy. However with the perspective of some 40 years, I now find it trivial. That is, a wandering aimless sequence of dated cliche's. Perhaps Roth's novel would fare better. Even Jack Klugman, who would normally dominate a scene, seems laid back. At the same time as I purchased this film, I also purchased ""Lovers and Other Strangers."" The latter has certainly withstood the test of time and I would recommend it highly for someone who wants to see a good comedy."
3,WATCHABLE,I SAW THE MOVIE AND I LIKED IT.. BUT I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE ENDING. I WOULD PROBABLY WATCH IT AGAIN THOUGH.
3,Dated sentimentality but solid performances and good film,"This was Ali McGraw's debut movie, and though there is some over-acting, she manages to carry the story successfully next to Richard Benjamin. This is the story about a Jewish Princess who is so spoiled she can't tell what's important. She is ultimately unable to be rescued by her prince, a confused guy, Neil, played by Benjamin to perfection, who doesn't want to end up as inauthentic as her but is not sure where to find his place. Though this movie is dated in almost every way, including a bad musical score, it still captures the morals of its time."
3,Old movie holds up but dated,"Very dated movie on cultural issues that are no longer in the public debate. But Ali, a flawed person in real life, is so gorgeous, it's just worth watching to see her walk across the screen."
2,great movie but gets stuck on the mac,It's a classic film but the streaming over a Mac shouldn't break up every five minutes and then go DOA at 11 minutes in. We had to second-guess a way to play it.
5,very cute movie,I saw this movie when it first came out and I loved Ali Mcgraw she was so cute and the movie was fun to watch but had a serious ending I still remember her from her other movies
5,soothing tea for digestion issues,I have a gut bacteria problem called SIBO which is similar to IBS. This tea is great for those times when that sick feeling flares up. I brew a big strong cup and within 10 minutes of drinking it my discomfort is greatly reduced. I'm so thankful that this is on the market!
3,beautiful product but.....,"I got a great price on this product. It's beautiful and elegant, perfect for my decor. But it was very difficult to mount properly and took a long time to get right. That's why I'm giving it three stars for ""good"" rather than four or five for great."
3,Sword is OK,"Sword was worth the price, slightly out of straight, plague was cheap, but the son loved it."
4,Nice piece for the money.,Sword was much nicer than I expected. I could do without the graphics they put on the display board but overall the price (<$60.00) was more than fair for what you get. Very nice piece when mounted on the wall.
5,Realistic and Beautiful!,"This sword was a gift for my husband, a medieval ""stuff"" collector. He loves it and often takes it off the mount and ""plays"" with it. It is so heavy and real looking, but not dangerous at all! The mount is also great, except that the pegs weren't quite straight on it. We had to play with it a bit or the sword would hang slightly crooked on the mount. Still, that is not a problem to us and we enjoy having it in our home. It's a great conversation piece. The price is so great for the quality of the sword! Most of this detail and weight run around $75+, so this was a treat!"
2,disappointment,"positives:- incredible screennegatives:- horrible battery life (due to incredible screen)- often not compatible with iTunes (call SONY if you don't believe me). When i installed it, shut down would lag for more than ten minutes. SONY explained it as common problem among users due to software incompatibility and recommended that I not install iTunes. you have no idea what it's like to have a near $3,000 computer that doesn't work with my iPOD.- highly, highly overpriced. can get much better deal and computer with HP- enormous power adapter (about as heavy as the laptop itself, you really need to see this beast to believe it)- computer vibrates when cd/dvd inserted into drive- problems with printing (again, SONY has no idea what is wrong)- worst $3,000 i've ever spent in my life. i was so much better off when i stuck with HP's. this is junk, do not buy!"
5,"Dependable, light and quite.","I have owned this cordless WAHL model for 30 years. It has taken me through heavy, full beards,light and tight comtemporary stubble and in-between...plus it's great on sideburns. I keep coming back to the WAHL cordless model because it is so handy as I have a trim at home in the morning, travel around the world or on a camping trip in the Outback I never have to worry about foreign outlet connections, electricity or service centers. It did cause a stir at airport security when the switch accidently got bumped on and the noise from my carry-on created a bit of an alarm. I knew exactly what it was and got a kick out of opening my bag for security. This model comes with a neat little soft-sided travel pouch that I've used ever since. The price is right and WAHL is as dependable as it gets."
3,beard trimmer?,The trimmer is fine for a moustache but tends to stall out on my beard. It could use a little more horse power if it is to be used for beards.
3,Good stand in.,Purchased this for my husband for Christmas to replace the older model he had that was dieing a slow death. It basically is the same exact in style and features but he has noticed that the blades are already getting rusty. Possibly a cheaper steel that the previous model he had? Still using and works great though but he's thinking he won't get as many years out of it as he did his old model.
2,Squid must have eaten this movie,"This movie is no longer what is was because so much content has been cut out of it. I would rather have the full length movie than this edited-for-time version. With the way it is on the DVD, the movie has lost its value. I would gladly purchase a DVD of the original version."
4,Another Benchley Made for TV Flick...,"This was a made for TV mini-series based on the Benchley book of the same name... The book was MUCH better but the movie is still ""good junk""... Entertaining and just fun to watch... I liked it then when it first debuted and still like it now for fun... Glad it was finally released..."
2,Not worse than the DVD -- exactly the same,"Basically they took the standard-def master from the 2-DVD set and put it on a Blu-Ray disc. THIS IS NOT IN HIGH DEF! It's the same as the DVD, same quality transfer and sound. If you don't own the DVD it's not a terrible buy at $10, and at least you don't have to change the discs out, but it's not in HD."
3,Does an uncut version exist?,"Thanks to everyone who clued me in that they butchered this version. It is one of my son's favorite movies and I was going to give it to him for Christmas, but I will wait until the full, uncut version comes out, if it ever does. A shame they feel they have to do this as it is really a good movie and the ""drunk"" scene is a pivotal one."
3,not as good as the tv version,"Although when it came out on tv it was a really good movie the videa seems to have left out certain areas, so I'm a little displeased with the DVD version. Hopefully someone will correct this oversight in the future!!"
2,The Beast: Too Much Cut Out,"As for ""The Beast"": I loved the original mini-series, but way too much footage was cut from the DVD version. The resulting movie seemed rushed and choppy. What's more, some of my favorite scenes were missing, including the night scene when the giant squid came near to shore.I enjoyed the DVD just enough to give it two stars. But I would not have purchased this DVD if I had known about the cutting room hatchet job."
2,Too Short,I was disappointed because so much was left out. Following each actor's part on the personal level gave more to the movie. Making it more human with their personal lifes. By shortening the film it just took something away.
2,Why is this edited?,"Hokey but highly enjoyable entertainment. I will not touch this edited version. They should think about what have they saved by editing this movie against what they are losing by so many people shunning it (or waiting for the uncut version).Actually, I will say I bought the VHS before realizing which version I got. It is still in the box. When the uncut version comes out on DVD, I will be sending my money in again.Paul"
1,"no closed captions , no subtitles , no excuse","if you are a deaf person don't bother buying this teriffic little television miniseries . likewise if you are hard of hearing or wish to read the dialogue and/or description of sounds depicted on screen . i highly anticipated this restoration of the complete mini-series as i'd read and quite enjoyed the book . the approx two hour film culled from this mini-series was a bit above mediocre if you'd read the book , but to go to the effort of fully restoring the complete and better total package (and not to have encoded either closed captions of subtitles) ought to be against the law . otherwise a fun film with a good cast with a pretty fair amount of effort put into it . what a blunder ."
1,Don't Buy This Blu-Ray,There is nothing high definition about this presentation and I'm sure the dvd looks better than the old video they used to re-master. I wish I had seen these reviews before I bought it. Save your money.
5,Yeah!,This is it! We've been waiting for this version and I'll be one of the first to buy! Thanks to all involved for getting it out to the fans.
1,CUT version - Awful compared to full version,"I was Extremely disappointed in this 115 minute version of the movie, The Beast. I could not tell from the information on Amazon that this was NOT the Full 176 minute version. I LOVE the full version. In my opinion this CUT version at 115 minutes loses ALL of the atmosphere that the Full 176 minute version has. I will not watch this chopped up 115 minute mess again. I have the full 176 minute version on VHS that i tape from TV. It does have all of the commercials but I would rather fast forward through the commercials and see the QUALITY version than watch the 115 minute mess. So in the future I will try to check out movies before I buy especially from-importcds and MovieMars.The Beast"
1,"It's a Soap Opera, not a Monster Movie","There's lots of yakking, and not much attacking.Basically we have a soap opera with a few minutes of giant squid thrown in.If edited down to 30 minutes, it might be watchable.I like bad movies, but not this bad. For a similar movie, but much better done, try watching the new colorized version of ""It came from beneath the Sea"", with Faith Domergue, a real movie star."
3,Is the DVD as bad as the sleeve?,"Just got this in the mail. Enjoyed the movie enough to want it (especially for Missy Crider... :) But this is the first DVD I've ever bought where the company that produced it didn't care enough to make sure to spell an actor's name correctly! Missy Crider is spelled ""Missy Cider"" on the back of the sleeve. Granted she's not a ""big name"" in the movie biz, but if I were her, I'd be royally pissed... I haven't watched the DVD yet, so I hope it has higher production values than this. Normally I'd give 3 1/2 stars for the movie, but I'm subtracting 1/2 point for the gaffe...Addendum: I've seen the movie and the DVD plays fine and the picture is good. I have no problem recommending this DVD despite aforementioned problem. If I could, I'd bump the rating back up to 3 1/2..."
3,Very POOR Blu ray Quality !!!!!,I gave this movie 3 stars because it is a great movie! But the quality is worse than a dvd !!! Im beeing 100% serious!! This looks like VHS quality !!!! Buy this on dvd not Blu ray!! It is in full screen also 4:3 because the movie was shot for tv in fullscreen in 1996.
5,the complete and total beast,I was so glad to find this movie in its entirity. I had bought another DVD that was all chopped up with missing scenes...this is much better
2,Movie has been butchered,"When ordered I expected this movie to be the same as the 2-part (4-hour) movie seen on TV. After watching it twice I realize the producer of this DVD cut out many critical scenes: the Founder's Day picnic, a father's promise to his daughter, the visit of the mother squid to her dead infant, the development of the relationships between characters, etc. Because these scenes were cut anyone who has seen this movie will be disappointed; those who haven't seen it will be confused as to what is going on.Peter Benchley's book on which this movie was based was excellent; the original movie was at least entertaining; this DVD, in the jargon of today - SUCKS!"
5,The Beast,"If you like William Peterson of CSI, you will like him in this Syfi original. It is a very good movie, I will give it 6 stars. Just watch it and see what you think!"
3,Frequentl Asked Questions,"FAQ offers the beginning Bible study participant for a tool for additional questions that may be revelant. For those more acquainted with the Bible it is less essential. There are times when even the most seasoned Bible study memeber may need reminded of the questions that may linger in others' minds. Additionally, it gives a meaningful introduction to each day's study."
1,Bad Bad Bad,"I'm not sure if the crew intentionally wanted to produce a bad horror flick, but whether or not they did, this movie was just awful. Poor acting, bad story, you get the point. Of course I know you shouldn't expect too much more from a ROTLD sequel, so I'll just leave it at that."
4,If you're looking for a good zombie flick......,"I enjoyed watching this one. Mostly, I enjoyed the fact that most of the cast was young(mid-twenties)and the acting went over pretty well. The action wasn't fantastic but was fun to watch. The movie really stood out on the make-up and gore, which were very well done. If you're looking for originality, dont watch zombie horror (they mostly follow similar plotlines). I love reviewers who watch a sequel and bash the producers for not being original. It is a sequel, mind you. If you enjoyed the earlier ones, I believe you will enjoy this too.Good action, great make-up, overall a good purchase."
2,Lame...,"Return of the living Dead 4 wasn't anything like 1,2, & 3, although I am not surprised, reading the other reviews on this movie. The acting was horrible, and the characters were annoying. There were a few good moments in the movie,like when the blonde haired whore died, but even that wasn't enough for me to give the movie a higher rating.There wasn't enough blood in the movie to keep me happy, and it only got ""good"" 50 minutes into the movie, but by then you'll probably be asleep, even after the movie was lame. A group of ordinary teenagers break into a high tech building to rescue their friend, (who ends up dying anyway.) Without going into anymore detail, the movie ends predictably, in the last 5 minutes of the movie the SWAT team comes in, kills all the remaining zombies, blah, blah, blah......"
4,I enjoyed it!,"It was a pretty good zombie movie. It reminded me of the ones before it. Although, it wasen't as funny. It needed a bit more gore and carnage. But, it was enjoyable. Watch it with an open mind. Don't compare it to anything. Let it stand on it's own. The best one of them all is Part 3!"
1,Meh..disliked on every level,"So I had no expectations when I bought the movie, but one: it must be good. How wrong I was. It was not entertaining at all, acting was fair in some places, plot is typical for this kind of movie. I don't like it. Come on every civilian made like so many head shots compare to the Swat team in the end of the movie which made none lol. Even when people have no ammo left, it was looking so ridiculous. Similar to other movies. The last zombie wave and gunshots were pathetic. I was counting minutes til the titles would be rolling. Verdict: No satisfaction from the movie, plain waste of time. What about the bunch of teenagers in this boring, bad movie(as the main characters)? They are not quite good at acting. You have every reason to skip this movie."
2,the series gets out of it,"This was made by some russians who never saw the original three movies at all. Those range from a classic , to great to good. This one is a mix of several mythologies in zombie flicks, you can't kill rotd zombies by head shots and this one has that. poor peter coyote found himself in this even. He now does lots of narration of national geographic channels shows, he needs to act too though. Anyways he can't save this , noone can if it was a stand alone zombie flick you could say well that is a ok low budget zombie flick but this one isn't stand alone they claimed sequelality. and that's why it's bad on that level. Still I own this and lots worse zombie flicks. So if you want a bad zombie flick this is it."
3,good fx but cut dvd,first off this is no classic but the fx work is top notch...however the lionsgate dvd is badly cut..just about all the zombie gore and headshots are cut down and some are missing fullstop.all these cuts don't do the film any favours and if you have only seen the dvd it looks weak...the uncut version is much better.
1,Very uneven. Could have been a great but is far from it.,"What is a great actor like Peter Coyote doing in a film like this? This fourth entry of the ROTLD series is no good because if offers very little except some nice makeup.Basically, this is a very cheap zombie movie that is only called ROTLD because in the very beginning we see those famous Trioxin tanks. But in fact, in some way, this film contradicts the whole series because here see the zombies dying by getting shot on the chest. WHAT??The acting is mediocre and many situations are quite ridiculous. I have no idea why a fine actor like Peter Coyote is doing here. His character is the typical (and stereotypical) evil scientist attempting world domination. When was the last time we saw that one? Duh!Bad acting and bad screenwriting usually are the key to disaster."
2,Um.....Confusing,"Well, even though this movie is titled Return of the Living Dead, it has nothing to do with the first to classic movies. Its not funny and it makes no damn sense. The zombies look awesome, but thats about the only plus to this movie. First annoying thing about this movie is how they kill zmbies. The first few need the classic bullet to the head, but then it seems like a direct shot to the pancreas will kill them. Consistent, no. The next thing is how the zombies act. In the beginning they are all the classic moaners and shufflers. At the end, one holds a conversation, throws out some one- liners and engages in a fist fight like they were Bruce Lee. Consistent, no. The last major problem I have is the ending with the zombie- borg- resident evil zombies. It made no sense. Why go in that direction at the end ? There were some cool gore effects and the zombies looked great, but thats about it. I just found myself annoyed after watching this movie."
2,Not as bad as it could have been,"The movie has an adequate storyline and the screenwriter does a good job of setting up the characters so you actually care (or root) for them when they die. Most of the acting is beyond horrible though, along with the dialogue. The movie is more in the vein of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise, rather than ""Return of the Living Dead"". The zombies are no longer extremely agile or fast-moving, but slow and dim-witted.The characters often make dumb moves like upon learning that the zombies ONLY die when shot in the head they STILL waste countless bullets on shooting them in the torso or chest. Morons!The movie has the annoying obligatory ""annoying brat brother"" in the cast but I was surprised and happy with what happened with that character."
1,Horrible Horror,"I ama fan of zombie flicks. Loved Return of the dead 1 2 and 3. But this is an outrage. The day it was released I looked everywhere at my local stores and no one had it, so I ordered it. Watched it within the hour it was recived and it just plain sucked. Ok the zombies has cheap make up like a yellowe face paint, they talked like normal and one particualr zombie actually fought a person fist fight. They are supose to eat brains not a fist fight. It wasnt at all gory or funny. Then cyborge zombies that had guns for arms. All around this is not even close to a movie people want to own, before you buy it rent it, if you cant find a retailer that rents it out, well then that tells you horrible quality"
2,"DO NOT BUY THIS , DO NOT RENT THIS , IF YOU SEE THIS IN THE STORES RUN AWAY","This is simples the WORST movie about zombies ever made , it's as bad as house of the dead * and i thought that wasn't possible O_O"
2,"Well, I have seen worse","It certainly isn't the worst zombie flick I have ever seen (that dubious distinction belongs to Children of the Living Dead) but to be honest, you can't have high expectations for a movie like this can you? It isn't an unberable movie to watch, especially if you take it for what it is ... a low budget B-Horror zombie movie."
4,They Always Return...,"The Zombies always return! Another good Zombie movie to add to my collection, I have been waiting to get this one for a while. I'm glad Amazon always has everything I'm looking for, and at a great price. If you are looking for another Zombie film to watch on a scary movie night, then this is one you are looking for!"
2,"Cool robot, bad vechile mode","This is a repaint of the basic energon figure Signal Flare. All the same gimicks are back as there are on every basic energon figure, the energon weapon and the energon star. In this case the weapon in a energon buzzsaw, I think. Transforming to robot mode is easy, just a few simple steps. In robot mode, the cannon becomes an arm so the larger energon disk can attach to it for energon collection or for blasting. Changing back to vechile mode is where this figure looses many stars. I have yet been able to put i back into the same vechile it was when i opened the package. It seem to me that the pegs for the legs are too far for the holes they go into to reach. Offshoot cannot have both legs attached at one time or to even have one leg attached and have it all look good."
2,I have to agree with Bob,"I agree with Bob on what he says about this transformer. Transforming back to vehicle is a pain; on has to remember about the hips having to swing 180 degrees while making sure the ""kibble"" is out of the way, and then have to remember to pull out the inner torso far more than is instinctive. This is what makes me give it a 4 for educational value, as it takes some reasoning to figure it out. The legs have a tendency to fall off, which is why I rated it a 2 for durability. They can be put back on, but you have to pay attention to how it hooks onto the hips.Still, it does have a cool robot mode. That's worth keeping it from a 1-star."
1,Not bad for 1989,"This isn't a bad book for 1989. It's not great either.The problem? Amazon deceptively describes this as a 1st edition published on January 15, 2002. It was published in 1989, as clearly stated inside the book. The content shows its age."
2,Dissapointed,"One reviewer stated ""Malicious INTENTIONS is a gripping Crime Drama and, at the same time, a beautiful love story"", another claimed "" DC has an amazing story telling talent!"" Yet another reviewer implied DC's writing is realistic. Unfortunately, based on those reviews, I read the book.To me it was a quick read that felt like a Nancy Drew mystery channeling a lesbian romance police procedural. The weaknesses and insecurities of the main character in Malicious Intentions made the possibility of her being a homicide detective completely absurd. As far as the police procedural part, a Nancy Drew mystery is more believable. Romance wise, if George and Nancy were to get together I suspect it would hotter than the romance in MI which is about as exciting as tepid bath water.I would advise checking out Wall of Silence by Gabrielle Goldsby, or Gun Shy by Lori L. Lake, and give Malicous Intentions a pass."
2,High hopes smashed,I bought these books at the reccomendation of a friend. I will still speak to her but will never follow her book advise again. I found both her books to lack imagination. I was bored and had to force myself to finish them. I have never stopped a book part way through but I wish I had with these.
2,So so product BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"This flash has a problem with the bottom slide to set Ft. I have been trying and trying and trying to get a hold of cust service at Vivitar for help. Good luck. I have tried e mail, the phone, the e box thing. I will probably send it back and get a speedlight."
1,Very Poor Durability,"I set about 25 of these up around my house with multiple transformers. Out of the box, I had to replace one or two bulbs per week. After a year, this increased to 3 or 4 per week. The units themselves then started to fail as well. When the whole thing became too expensive and too much labor to maintain, I uninstalled the whole thing and threw it away. Buyer beware!"
2,Malibu lights,Good price. Arrived quickly. Two the ten lights were faulty. I have not returned them yet.
1,"Dull, yellow light","This product states hallogen in add but on box it states ""low voltage"" ""energy efficient"" The light is dull and yellow compared to the lights I purchased at Lowes. Does not give off white bright light . I would not purchase these again. I bought three, big mistake."
3,Refund provided and two new covers,"Well the folks over at Island Sun and Garden made good on the two faulty covers I ordered previously. Amazon also refunded my money due to the poor quality of the initial covers. Not sure when I will try out the new covers, probably next summer. Keep in mind they are made from plants and they won't last forever. They do make a very cool tropical look though."
1,"Oh dear, more dreck published by this non-rabbi.","Oh dear, more dreck published by this non-rabbi. (The author claims to be a rabbi, but the Yeshiva he claims his ordination from denies that he is a rabbi.)Like all of his other works, this one is full of terrible translations, censored and edited texts, and horrible commentary. Berg's ""explanations"" are rejected by all Jewish authorities, Orthodox and non-Orthodox, religious and academic. Berg is attempting to create a non-Jewish and for-profit version of Kabbalah, and it is just embarassing. Instead of reading his nonsense, please check out books on this subject by real authorities and good writers:Read, for instance, ""The Jewish Mystical Tradition"", by Ben Zion Bokser; ""Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism"", by Gershom Scholem; ""Zohar: Annotated & Explained"" by Daniel Chanan Matt and Andrew HarveyI would also suggest ""The Wisdom of The Zohar: An Anthology of Texts"", Ed. Isaiah Tishby, and translated from the Hebrew by David Goldstein."
2,Very uncomfortable,I ordered these and have been very unhappy how long it is taking to break them in. The front part cuts into my feet. Surprising as I have always had such great luck with Steve Madden shoes and have been a fan for a long time. I will keep trying but they hurt!
4,Great on Salads and Past....Does not make me vomit in the least,We stumbled upon this in Vienna initially. Great as a side embellishment to any dish. Rich in flavor and very hard to find here in America. Great on Salad or in sauces for an added rich tomato flavor. Add paprika if you like spicy dishes. Also great on its own in pasta.
5,Talking P0ny Jack in the Box,"Wow! One of our best toy buys for our grandchildren.Goes way beyond the non-talking ""Jack"".Buy a few and enjoy the joy it brings to kids starting with yourselves."
2,"Beautiful, but poor quality","I love this toy in concept -- so much so that I've bought three of them in the hopes of getting one that worked properly. The horse did not neigh in the first one, so I returned it. The second one arrived badly dented and was also returned. The third time one arrived in good condition and actually worked, much to the delight of my daughter. After just four months of gentle, occasional use, though, the lid will no longer stay closed. After three strikes, we're done. We won't be wasting money on a fourth one."
3,fun jack in the box for those who don't like clowns,"my 2 year old loved this toy -- it's hard to close because of a bit of a latch problem unless you turn the handle all the way after the song, but he loves the music and fell in love with the pony and kept kissing it and petting it ---"
3,not like the typical jack in the box,"I was hoping to get the 'old school' jack in the box, but this is not it. The music is not as fun (but that is just my opinion). ALso, when the horse is about to pop open, the music stops and it starts to neigh first, and then pops open. Which is disappointing b/c my daughter loves to be surprised, which is why I bought this, and this is not surprising at all since it gives you a warning! I wouldn't recommend this if you are looking for the old school-pop-goes-the-weasel type toy."
2,A disappointment,"As much as I loved the Curious George jack in the box , I disliked this one. The tune is unfamiliar. A jack in the box traditionally plays Pop goes the weasel and the creature inside pops up on the word ""POP"". Then the child shoves him back inside and starts again. But theres no holding mechanism for the lid until you continue winding til the end of the tune whatever it is. Also there is annoying repeated whinnying that I'm sure will drive crazy the parents of the toddler who is getting this for Christmas."
1,Waste of money,I bought this pony jack-in-box for my daughter after the first one I bought her stopped working and after just 3 days this one stopped working as well. I will never buy another Schylling jack-in-box ever again.
2,second item broken,I chose this because after the first one I ordered didnt arrive and they said it was lost. I had to replace the order and wait for a refundon the first. It was for a birthday present which was now not going to happen. when the second one came in it was broke it would pop out of the box but it wouldn't neigh and something was broken and ratlling when she moved the box . So again a late birthday present now. Worthless. I am so mad. When my grandaughter would move the box you could hear something broke inside. I am not happy and think it should be replaced at no charge this time. If this is not done I will never recommend this company again. Poor merchandise
2,Overpriced and not very good quality,"I got this jack in the box because my daughter loves horses. I personally feel it is very overpriced for what it is. It feels very cheaply made. With that said, my daughter does like it, I wouldn't say she loves it. The song is ok and the horse says neigh when he jumps out of the box. The only problem is the horse actually starts to neigh right before he jumps out of the box which kind of ruins the surprise ... but not to worry because the neigh sound actually stopped working within a few hours of opening the toy. Not sure how long this toy will hold up and we have only had it a few days."
3,"Just a reference, does not give you the wider picture.","This is just a reference, written in a style a bit too terse. Not good as a tutorial.For a wider picture and introduction, see Managing Projects With Make (I believe the newer editions only cover GNUMake, which is different than what BSD developers use)."
3,A weaker Ghote,"H.R.F. Keating's exceptionally rich series of novels with mysteries in them takes a dive with this absorbing but one-note Bollywood murder story. Ghote is brought in to find the murderer of a famous player of Bollywood villains, and over and over the point is made that his lust for fame cripples his ability to think clearly; also, apparently life's reliable pleasures are the best. It's also structurally unsound: Ghote interviews one person, is disappointed, given another name, repeats, etc. Still, Keating is typically absorbing, and events conclude quickly enough to make it unobjectionable. His dim view of Indian police hierarchy is on better display other places."
2,Where's the CD?,"I ordered this book at a great price and when it came it was in good condition. However, in order to receive the full benefit from this book you need the CD that comes with it. It didn't. I wrote and asked where the CD was and have never heard back. I will be reluctant to purchase another book that requires a CD without some confirmation that I am going to receive it. Without the CD the book is virtually useless."
2,"terribly uneven, often inexpert","This book, like many such collections (especially those that bring together papers from a conference), is tremendously uneven in quality. There are a few good essays here--and they are by persons who have written illuminating and substantial pieces in the past. And then there are a lot of weak essays here--pieces which do not get de Beauvoir right or which attempt without success to advance certain themes that are supposed present in her work. The volume's introduction is especially flawed in this respect--as a piece of intellectual history or contextualization it is not bad (though not original either), but as a piece of philosophy it is . . . well, not philosophical. Volumes by Arp, Berghoffen, and Bauer measure up very well to this collection."
2,WTF...it's small and shallow,"Some joker here said this book was an ""Excellent coffee table book."" When you think of a coffee table book, you think of a big book with large pictures.This book is 6 inches...it's a combed bound landscape pocket book.Sure the pictures and the short essays that accompany them are lovely...bring a magnifying glass!However, the essays often point out the shortcomings of the book. In one case, it talks of how a garden was built to be enjoyed from multiple points of view; however, you only get one photo of the garden. In another case, a pond garden is described as being enjoyed from a boat; but the picture is from the shore.For you zen folk: the nature of the book is not in harmony with the content of the book. A pocket book can never cover the scope of these gardens.I gave it two stars because it might be good as a learning aid to those studying Japanese gardens...the landscape binding make it a pretty good flash-card system."
3,Pretty to look at but...,"...it's only a 12 month calendar. Sure, that's fine for a regular calendar but you want your baby calendar to cover at least up to the first birthday so they should have made it 13 months!"
1,Wrong stuff,"Too expensive and it has greatly disappointed me.It is just a collection of images and text dowloaded from the Marshall Space Flight Center Archive, and other free web pages dedicated to the german scientist."
4,Another Pullman and Another Oxford but Worth Reading Still,"Fans of Pullman's trilogy should receive a fair warning before moving any further. This is not Lyra's Oxford, this is our Oxford so expect thugs, sex, crime but also love, trust and friendship.Pullman retells the story of Romeo and Juliet with extreme adroitness. He manages to keep the lyrical beauty and truth of the play and avoids desperate attempts of retaining any elements that would seem dated and out of place in a modern novel.This is a novel for younger adults but if you feel that your 13+ year olds have never heard about sex, you may need to read it first yourself. The danger is you may get hooked on Pullman seriously."
1,Stick with the fantasy,"I wonder if PP is embarassed by this now? Having loved His Dark Materials I thought he might have done ok with some YA lit. Bad move, not only is it 'a modern day Romeo and Juliet' (it's the answering machine that screws up the message), the first line is great - if he was an unpublished teenager. Terrible, clunky plot that recycles cliche after cliche, teenage boy in love at first sight (oh please) and of course, all the men that meet Jenny want to have sex with her, because she's beautiful, skinny and stupid, with no will of her own. But that's not her fault , because as we all know, all beautiful uneduacated girls have been sexually abused by their fathers and this marks them out as victims.I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this trash, it's substandard even for ordinary YA lit, but to think this is the same person who wrote the Golden Compass? He definetly needs to stick to fantasy. Just awful."
2,Would not keep my phone inside,"At first, my phone would stay snug inside this case, but after a month or so I guess the fabric became stretched and my phone would wiggle its way out. In fact, I lost one phone thanks to this case becoming so loose. Look elsewhere or get one with a velcro closure. Definitely will not be buying one like this again."
3,"Fit was a bit loose for my application, but...","Fit was a bit loose for my application, but...I used a 1/4"" rubber band around the circumference and cut a piece of foam; which came in the pouch and left it inside to better fit my Motorola w376g Phone. All in all, not bad. YMMV."
2,Weak Program,"I purchased this program hoping to have a complete math program for my child. What I found was that it had limited capability. For instance, when your child works a problem they are not able to enter it into the worksheet. You can only click and see if your answer is correct. This means that there is absolutely no tracking of your child's success or failure.Once your child has finished a small set of problems there are no more!! Other programs out there will allow you to regenerate worksheets so that your child will be able to practice their new skills. Who learns math with only 5-15 problems per concept?I contacted the manufacturer and they were willing to refund my money because I was dissatisfied. Their response was that it is a new program out on the market and still has glitches. You make the decision if ""glitches"" are worth $40."
3,Not as good as other ASE Manual Drive study guides,"I'm throwing this book in the trash before it confuses me any further. I don't want this book to cause me to miss questions on my ASE exam next month. I started off by reading the section on clutches. The author seems to be inconsistent (or at least unclear)when using the terms ""released"" and ""engaged"". Is he talking about the clutch pedal or the clutch disk? When the cluth pedal is released, the cluth disc is engaged and vice-versa. The author is not clear on this. A few more words would help make things much clearer.Also to make things more confusing, the figures do not seem to match the text discussion. The book seems to have been quickly put together with no technical review.The Manual Transmission ASE study guides by Delmar and Mitchell seem to written much more clearly with more consistent terminology when discussing clutches. I'll use these to get prepared for the ASE exam."
4,No instructions included!!,LOVE THE TABLE! But it was hard to assemble without instructions! The stools are cute but tiny! Worth the price if you're looking for a small breakfast bar.
5,The Human Question Review,"The Human Question by Hervey Cunningham Peoples is an easy to read exploration of human origins. The text is well researched and deals with the issues of God, evolution and bibical teachings. The author succeeded in answering The Human Question. This text will enhance any individual's understanding of the process of evolution and will certainly help in refining their own personal opinions. The book is must reading for both amateurs and professionals Jerry from Alabama"
1,Do Not Be Mislead,"Be sure to read every word of this ad. The pegs in the picture are not part of the sale/pkg. The mounts are the only thing you are buying for $49. I placed the order & sent an email asking if they would ship as soon as possible because I was leaving on a long solo ride. The order did get to me in time, but much to my dismay it was for mounts only.. leaving me to scramble to find some somewhere locally. The response from the seller was polite, but said that the ""part # listed is indeed correct and is only being the 1 1/4"" clamp-on mounts"". I was supposed to know their part #s? I give this as high as 1 star only because the mounts ""appear"" to be good quality, although I would not have paid $49 for mounts only."
3,Eh,"Happy, but not ecstatic. Broke a,set screw. Did not comfortably fit around my highway bars, but they do look nice. I still would've bought them because they are not cheap looking."
1,Poor Design. Poor Quality. Poor Company,"Purchased this item from Amazon with their usual excellent service, and upon receipt of the item, the problems began. The band was broken requiring a visit to the local jewelers for repair. I figured this was cheaper, quicker, and easier than returning to Amazon. I should have returned it. First, as others have mentioned, the watch has no backlight, terrible contrast, and requires very specific lighting to be read. Then it started resetting itself. For no rhyme or reason, it will just forget the time and date and start over. I attempted to contact Kenneth Cole by email, but no response. I would recommend you look elsewhere for a watch."
4,A little hard to read...,This watch is beautiful. The lines and dial are very modern and cool. The only two draw backs are it's a bit difficult to read at first and there is no light to read it at night. But if you are a watch person and just really enjoy the visual appeal of a good looking watch. This watch is for you. I love it and so did my boyfriend.
3,its okay!! you get what you want!!! or what you dont want!!!,"I'm not a big fan of wrist watch nor use them regularly, but recently i was looking for something which looks stylish yet not so typical of watch- more like a wristband,so i saw this @ amazon & got it after comparing with similar models-I would say,if this watch would've a good contrast and backlight,i'll surely give it 5 star,it need light in order to display time,i wonder if it's a real LCD display, as its very dim, if you are looking for a fancy watch (and dont care about its sole purpose) then it's not a bad choice otherwise, think twice before you spend 75$i thought of returning it, but then heck!! its better than nothing on your wrist"
3,nice looking when shown on internet display,nice looking when shown on Internet. but in reality it need some changes e.g. a light to see in dark places a book or pamphlet to guide u through the understanding of it . and the numerals should be in green or red to better display the time
2,So so.....,"Pros:Cool and unique display.Can play the game - Can u tell what time it is? with friends.Cons:It is clunky and heavy.For a liquid crystal display, it is thick.Difficult to tell time !!Bottom line: Dont buy. There are better watches in the same price range"
2,clunky watch,"The transaction went smoothly as well as the return. The watch was a gift for my husband and unfortunately he was disapoointed as the watch was not only HEAVY, but beyond chunky and clunky for such a sleek design, was disappointing. Buying another Skagen instead."
3,OK but I found it hard.,I think this was a bit hard. The training was fun but the campaigns were just to hard. I can't even get past the first mission. But the training brought my rating up some. All in all I wouldn't get it if you don't have it.
4,Very Happy!,"Very Happy! Only reason I gave it a 4 star was because I have not opened the can. The order shipped fast, great condition and looks good. I am using up some others that are open now and will post another update when I open this can and use it."
4,A good summary of hell in a small place,"Hell had a home on earth, and that was Latvia in the 1940s, probably the most crimson patch in the so-called ""bloodlands"" between Hitler and Stalin. Rather than just a moralistic expose of ""totalitarian crimes,"" the author has done a meticulous job of social analysis, delineating who supported which invader and why. Ironically the local nationalists were more blood-thirsty than the Nazis, who drew back at the excesses of their erstwhile collaborators. Focusing on the mixed ethnic/religious region of Latgalia, the reader must sometimes close his eyes at the kaleidoscope of ethnic politics and class interest than swirled in this tight corner. How dizzying it must also have looked to its would-be conquerors, hoping to exploit its class and ethnic antagonisms only to be turned and hamstrung by them. Essential reading for anyone seeking in-depth understanding of the time and place, without the sweeping generalizations of Timothy Snyder's ""Bloodlands."""
3,so so,"It was okay, didn't think it was that challenging and I ended up getting bored 3/4 into it and just couldn't continue. It's not the length of the video, I'm used to practicing for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, but possibly the way it is sequenced. I think I'll give it a second chance, using the matrix system to better set up the different sections. FYI, I used Play All originally and the stretchy, calming poses were right at the 3/4 mark and then transitioned into inversions and so on."
4,Great power yoga DVD,"I really like this DVD. There is about 2 and a half hours of material and it's challenging. I love that you can choose a sequence or a specific section. The only thing I'm not crazy about is that the various sequences are not very different. If I'm choosing from a variety of sequences I don't want to feel like I'm doing the same sequence over and over. But otherwise, it's a great DVD."
3,Not My Favorite,"I had been using Rodney Yee's videos Yoga Burn and Power Yoga: Total Body workout before purchasing this. This is very different. Although as challenging as Power Yoga: Total Body, the style just did not suit me as much. Rodney's cues are concise and to the point... Sadie adds some ""motivation"" with hers. Some of the poses feel awkward to me, and not in a good, ""this is working my muscles out"" kind of way. For instance the high lunge where the back foot is kept arched for an eternity rather than being grounded as is more common in yoga; that one gave me an awful foot cramp. The chair pose hugging in and out gave me a back cramp. There are a lot of crunches. I think having done more traditional yoga, I just did not get into this one. I still use the video once in a while, with lukewarm enthusiasm. All that being said, this video might suit someone else's exercise personality perfectly."
5,A MUST FOR YOUR YOGA DVD LIBRARY,"I echo all the great sentiments written about Sadie and her instruction, this DVD is wonderful and a super boost if you've had other yoga DVDs and gotten bored with them. You'll love this for a long time, I cannot wait until she puts out another!"
4,Well Done,I haven't even seen the WHOLE video yet. I have been doing sections of it. This is excellent and Sadie lives up to the reputation that you hear about. Background.....I have been in the Fitness industry for well over twenty years. I was a competitive bodybuilder and a high intensity personal trainer. This video is a well done piece that will work you head to toe. Thank you Sadie for your contribution to all of us!
4,thorough and challenging,"I like this video. The selections allow you to pick a preset program or pick and choose the routines you want. The longer programs are challenging and effective. I have improved my strength, flexibility and form as a result of practicing with Sadie."
1,"Sold as new, but it is not new",This was sold as a new item. It is not new. It has been opened and has obviously been used. Please explain.
3,More like a yoga inspired workout,"Let me start by saying that I love Sadie. I love her personality, her philosophy, her writing. I bought this DVD with much anticipation. I have been seriously practicing ashtanga yoga for a couple of years now, and thought this would be a good variation to my practice Well it is and it isnt. It is a good workout, but not a good ""yoga"" workout. The moves involve multiple repetitions of challenging (in terms of strength) positions and really does get you sweating, yet it feels very little like yoga the way I know it. The positions are challenging in the sense of requiring a lot of strength and stamina but I never get the feeling it is doing anything for me at a deeper level. And I dont mean just spiritual but even say the joints or the endocrinal glands or other internal systems. Really wanted to love this one, but just cant."
5,massage student,"Being fairly new to yoga, but not to exercise, I find this workout with Sadie easy to follow and challenging. Out of all my yoga Cd's, this is by far my favorite. I really feel like i have had a workout. The way she flows trough the poses is very strengthening for the whole body. it is helpful to me as a massage student with building my core strength and posture....thanks Sadie"
1,You've got to be kidding!,"This is the worst money I've spent in a long time. The sound is so bad that I'm better off using the 1"" speakers in my laptop. Terrible sound quallity. Tried it on wood and glass and both are unacceptable."
2,Fun while it lasts...,"A fun novelty item, or a gift for a gadget hound. My only complaint is my soundbug broke after 2 months of use. Untill then it was a neat toy...more for show than function."
5,Reading this book induces ultraelectronic spiritual experien,"This book has invoked ultraelectronic impacts (spiritual experiences) resulting in changes in brain chemistry, for me. I come back to it again and again in understanding my inner psychological development in terms of a relationship to a greater whole. Although the emphasis is externally on groups, this emphasis is merely to point out that every individual is part of a group and progresses as a function of a group. I have bought 7 copies of the book, selling it when it drives me crazy (this is a good sign of energetic working with the ideas contained, even if one is disgusted). The same telepathic dictator wrote this book as wrote The Course in Miracles (he predicts his future telepathic dictation in this book). The more I recommend this book the less work I have to do relating to people."
2,Not a complete study guide for the PW0-100 exam,"I liked this book but as the CWNA study guide it falls short of expectations. The PoE coverage was almost entirely lacking and there were many other areas that did not fully cover the exam question areas. I wrote CWNP and received a lame excuse as to why it was not complete and to disregard the claim printed on the cover that it provided ""Complete coverage of the CWNA exam objectives"". They said the exam has gone through considerable changes since the book's publication and thus does not match in many areas anymore. I suggested an on-line suppliment to cover the changes and they said that was not necessary, I should research the changes myself. As the exam study guide it deserves 2 stars, as a general guide to wireless networking it deserves at least 3 or 4 though obviously it is getting dated."
5,CWNA Tird Edition,This is the only text book that you will need to prepare yourself for the Examp PW0-100.
4,Excellent musicianship but almost too epic,"The music on this disk is certainly incredibly technical and really impressive overall but it just really gets boring quick. Almost to ""grandiose"" in scale for me. I would liken it to Lord of the Rings in terms of heavy metal. Its incredibly deep in terms of substance and everything about it is nearly perfect but you just can't watch it over and over. Too boring after a few experiences.Probably more taste than anything because this is a great CD... just not on replay."
5,Wow....,"Emperor has come an extremely long way since the 'Nightside Eclipse'. This album isn't really even black metal. Its more of a progressive type album with many shifts and changes. The only way to listen to this CD for the first time is to hear it the whole way through without skipping tracks and with the lights turned off. A haunting jeourney of lightning speed riffage and musical complexity that is sure to stun you. A must have for any fan of Emperor, and any fan of challenging music."
3,Emperor's Last Album,"Overall this is a very good album. The production and musicianship are top notch. It is probably the most sophisticated album Emperor has done, unfortunately it is also their least effective. There are some great tracks on here: ""The Eruption"", ""Depraved"", ""The Tongue of Fire"" and ""In the Wordless Chamber"". But the album as a whole seems to lack heart. It seems overally pretentious (what else do we expect from a band who put the phrase ""Emperor Plays Sophisticated Black Metal Art Exclusively"" in the liner notes of their second album?!). It is hard for me to call this release a black metal album (this is of course irrelevant to whether the album is any good or not), but it does clearly have a black metal aspect to it. While not an essential release (let alone an essential Emperor release) it is worth acquiring."
4,tons of tones,"This is an incredible tour de force and an awesome metal cd. If you want your neighbors to be REALLY frieghtened, forget cannibal corpse or anything else. I do believe this is what you hear when you die. The musicianship is amazing, lyrics are first-rate. Wide vocal ranges. If the usual metal ain't cuttin' it this will reinstill all faith in truly brutal metal. If you purchase this with ASMEGIN and ARSIS your next few weeks will be a euphoric blurr of ecstacy. This s@#$ should be illegal."
1,emperor has turned into sorry softies,"I honestly cannot believe that a band like emperor, who put out some of the craziest, most perfect music ever(Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk)could actually attach their name to such [awful music]as this. These songs sound like soundtrack music for a fisher price kiddie movie about cartoon vampires or something. It's really goofy, the drums are slow and everything is predictable. Ihsahn also decided to sing more, and if anyone has ever heard him they know it's like if the guy from Iron Maiden got his balls cut off. When Ihsahn stops screaming and starts this pathetic moaning, then his voice is always the worst thing on any emperor album. A lot of people think his voice is ""passionate"" or something, but if you can appreciate real singing talent then you will laugh at this [stuff]. Also, this might as well not even be called ""black"" or ""metal."" ..."
3,Not for beginners,"First the positive: I agree with some of the other reviewers that the stories and descriptions of french food philosophy are worth reading. Also the fillet mignon in roquefort sauce IS divine and will stay in my repertoire.However, I must admit wondering if some of the other glowing reviews have been written by the author's friends. I am a big fan of french food and a longtime cook, but I haven't been pleased with how many of the recipes I've tried turned out. Some of the flavors have been odd or the dishes watery. The author's recommendations on cooking times or temperatures were way off on most of the recipes I've tried and I can only imagine this being confusing for someone who's just starting to cook.Unfortunately, I don't think Michael Roberts is doing for french cooking what Marcella Hazan did for italian."
5,Simply The Best Cookbook Ever,"Little needs to be said about this book! It is the best cookbook I have ever owned. It is used weekly in our home. Recipes are simple, quick and absolutely delightful. You don't need any other French cookbook, although Parisian Home Cooking will only wet your appetite for more and more of this wonderful genre of food! An absolute must! Michael put me on the list for your next book!!!"
5,Si Bon!,"Was very pleased with the book - it was in excellent condition, and contained loads of information I think would be very helpful to my daughter, for whom it was a gift, for her upcoming trip to Paris for a two-week cooking school. Thanks!"
5,One of my top 10 cookbooks,"I have lots and lots of cookbooks, but this one definitely makes my top 10 list. All the dishes I've tried have turned out delicious. Highly recommmended (. . .)I love this book. The duck with green peppercorn sauce is unreal and has made me famous to some, friend to many. (. . .)P>Really a wonderful book."
3,Read in passing...,"This book offers insight into some Parisian kitchens, its fun and might spur an idea or two. But this book will not have any surprises for cooks who have tried french cuisine."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I am sure I would have loved the programs (I have the first6) if the CD's had been any good. The first CD was readable, But the rest for the series was not. Contacted seller, but there was no joy to be found there."
1,NCIS season 7,"The disks in season 7 only played the previews and not the program. We found all disks in the set to be defective. Therefore we returned them to the seller which was Tons-of-stuff located in Medford, Wisconsin and received a refund."
1,Did not get my order,"HELP!! I placed my order on April 10, 2011 and have not received it and NO reponse to my e-mail inquirying of it's status."
1,Price Jump,"TV Series is great, but why did the price of this set jump 33% in 1 day? Should have ordered yesterday! Yesterday's price was already how and now another $10 added on? Sorry...will look elsewhere..."
5,Best 1st episide EVER,"Do not know who watched the 1st episode BUT BUT BUT that has to be the best ever. So it dies down in the middle from Episode 14 to 19, Who cares."
5,NCIS Season 7,"I was REALLY disappointed in the FIRST episode...didn't like it at all. With promises of a real kicker of a season opener, that's what we got? The same old same old....nothing going on with Tony and Ziva, no suggested romance at all. As for the rest of the season, I loved every episode! Can't wait until this set comes out on DVD :)"
4,Great season 7 - big drop in video quality however,"I love the show (it is one of my all time favorites) and the quality of the Season 7 episodes is consistent with that of the previous seasons.However, am I the only one that noticed a huge drop in video quality with this season's set?The macro-blocking and fuzziness of the image is near-VHS quality!One point off for poor presentation."
5,Great season,"NCIS is one of my favorite shows, and it's great to have the seasons to watch at my own pace."
5,NCIS Season 7 is a wild ride,"NCIS Season 7 delivers fast paced action, interesting personal relationships and revelations about the characters and a good deal of drama. I enjoyed the special features including the cast round table on the last disc.I enjoyed commentaries on episodes especially with David McCallum and Mark Harmon. This season had great momentum and Season 8 will likely build on it.I received my order in less than a week."
5,Good Show,This is the best show ever and is still going strong. You cant get any better than Mark Harmon or Michael Weatherly. The show never gets old. LOVE IT
5,NCIS DVD,"A SERIES I ENJOY,THE DVD SHOULD HAVE HAD A PLAY ALL BUT STILL A GREAT ACTION, HUMUROUS, AND FAMILY LOYALITY TYPE SHOW"
4,Great,I have only gotten thought about 5 to 10 episode's. I love NCIS I saw season 6 and wanted to see what happen.
4,NCIS - season seven review,"I really like the video. Why it didn't get 5 stars is one of the episodes won't play at all. It gets to a certain part of the video, about 1/2 way into the story line and it cuts to the end every time. I looked at the play side, and there is a visible smudge in the middle of that episode. If I had purchased it in a store locally, I could have returned it for faultiness. Since I didn't, I am stuck with an episode that won't play."
5,NCIS Season 7,"It's NCIS! What else can you say? Either you love the show or you don't. Received my seventh season in good condition, without an unreasonable wait, and the Team was ready to go. It don't get any better than that!"
5,Love This Show,"I just love this show. I bought the season to catch up on the shows I missed last season before watching this season. Not sure what it is about this show, but it is addictive."
5,GIBB'S DOES IT AGAIN,"THIS SHOW IS SO WELL WRITTEN AND THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CAST MAKES DRAWS YOU IN TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE PART OF THE TEAM. WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE PART OF THE FAMILY,IT'S A PROGRAM YOU CAN WATCH OVER & OVER WITHOUT GETTING BORED. ALTHOUGH NOT EVERY PROGRAM IS GOLDEN, THEY ARE ALL WORTHY OF THE NAME ""NCIS""."
4,Great Overall!,"Fantastic overall! Great timing to get the DVD, and it was in good condition! I'm very happy with the end results!"
3,good show,"I have discovered this show the past month. It is a very good show. My main problem is that the lib writers find the need to go after conservatives and promote the Muslims in a good light. They never do this for any other religion.I do not watch TV shows, but I have been sold on this one."
5,NCIS 7,"Not only will I recommend the 7th season of this show, I recommend the other 6 seasons. When the original pilot was a spin off of JAG, I said that I would not watch this show because Mark Harmon was not one of my favorite actors. But I watch it anyway. So, as I said earlier, I own the first six seasons and have pre-ordered the 7th season. Not only do I like Harmon but the entire cast is the best. This is my number one show on TV.The Mentalist is my number 2. I even watch reruns more than other 1st run shows. The whole cast works so well together. When Kate was killed off I thought that it would really changed the show. But I'm glad to say it didn't. If you haven't watched NCIS, give it a try and I think you will be hooked."
5,NCIS more is better,"Each year I wait until the season shows up on DVD. It's a good show with a great cast, the writing is excellent, and the production values are top of the line. If you like patriotic action police television, this is the one to watch. I don't have TVO or cable and can't stay up late to watch it on primetime. Besides, the commercials degrade the plot! This way I can see it when I want and I can now watch 7 seasons anytime. It's a mood elevator for me to see positive roll models with character. UHRAH!"
5,reruns,best reruns ever. Very easy to stream your favorite episodes. Its easy to pick out whatever you want to see.
5,NCIS 7,If you loved the first 6 series you will love this. If you haven't seen the first 6 but love great characters and interesting storylines buy it anyway.
5,NCIS - the number one show on TV,"This has to be the best season yet, and as the writers on the extras say, it just keeps on getting better and better.The characters are awesome, so well written and acted. Some wonderful scenes all through the season. My favourite characters are Gibbs and DiNozzo and I think they are the best written.Twenty-four very good episodes to enjoy over and over. And, I have been watching them over and over. The season finale has to be the best yet."
1,NCIS- The complete Seventh Season,"BAD PURCHASE. ""IS A COPY""The box with the Cds I purchased with this sellerin my opinion is a ""COPY"" of the original season.For years I Bought complete series of the Tv Show and is the first time the product does not look original.NCIS - The Complete Seventh Season"
2,Poor image,"The image quality was surprisingly poor. Not sure if this is possibly a knock-off. I have a HD TV and own season 7 which shows great quality on the same tv. It make no sense that season 8 would be a quality less than season 7 (season 7 was not any type of specialized edition).To explain the image quality, it's a bit like watching a VHS tape that has been dubbed. The pixels are blocky/grainy and the color is mildly distorted."
2,Misleading title,"I was disappointed when receiving the book. Despite of its title, all but one of the described hikes have an estimated hiking time of at most three hours which can hardly be considered a day hike. The shortest hike isn't a hike at all, followed by one lasting 10 to 30 minutes."
3,great hidden hikes!,"I used this book & found several wonderful hikes that weren't mentioned in any of the other Kauai guide books. The best was the Waiema Canyon hike -- it wasn't a super-easy hike, but four of us (ranging in age from 25 to 50) did it in half a day. We had lunch by a beautiful hidden waterfall, & during the hike we found spectacular views of the canyon. Recommended."
2,Probably Not Worth It,"There are a couple (out of 55) interesting and unique hikes in this guide, but if you have other books (which you probably do) then you already have the information. A couple of these hikes are complete cheats, like visiting the russian fort and a couple of the beach walks (you can figure those out on your own!).Only worth pulling off the shelf if you are going to do a LOT of hikes and need some more ideas besides the ""usual""."
3,adequate at best,"You simply do not find anything unique in the book that you could not find in other sources. Although I prefer the shorter hikes, less than 4 hours long, this book simply did not live up to my expectations."
4,"Deeper, and Funky","Dan did it again with a constant pounding of brand new house beats. The beginning and end of the album show a deeper style, but the middle is non stop head spinning house bliss. Highly recommended for any fan of house music beacuse of the fact that ""In Stereo"" covers so much ground."
5,Perfection,If you like Dan you'll love this CD it's got a retro party feel with slammin tracks. The breakdowns break way down but come back higher that when they started. I personally think the second half is the best. Definitely grab it if you see it
1,Trendy crap,"Seriously. I don't know if he's trying to be funny, but I'm not laughing. I'm only rating this cd because of what a waste of time it is to rate them all. They each suck powerfully and consistently. This is crap that a ""gen-x'er"" would consider good ""techno"" music so they can seem ""open-minded."" For those of you who love junk like Slipknot, Linkin Park, Fuel, Limp Bizkit or anything else MTV imposed, you probably will love DJ Dan."
2,Worst Techno CD Let Down to Date,"Probably the worst techno let down I've had to date. Sure I've primarily listened to Euro techno, but have also bought DJ Icey and Sasha and Digweed. After reading everyone's reviews I thought I'd give DJ Dan a chance. Let that be a lesson to everyone. When an Amazon.com CD has 7 used for sale, that should be an indicator of the CD's quality. Maybe it's because it's straight boring House or maybe I needed to be on something to enjoy this as much as the other reviewers, but this type of CD is the reason why non-techno lovers hate techno (I know that was a double negative). It's just a bunch of methodical beats thrown together with little change. Sorry Dan fans, but you guys need to experience some real DJ's. Once you go DJ Dean (Tunnel Trance Force series) you never go back. Sure his CD's cost a mininumim of ... but once you own one of those double cd sets, you'll realize it was worth the money. If you want good American techno get Sasha, Digweed or Icey!"
5,Beautiful Book,"This book was purchased for a friend as I already had a copy of it. This is one of the most beautiful books about Goddesses I've purchased to date. I've purchased many, many books about Goddesses, but this one had some of the most beautiful pictures, etc. in it."
4,beautiful,"Imagery is great. The pictures last a while. I got two sets. The second one was alittle faded, but still beautiful images. descriptions are good."
1,Just throw the book away,"After reading ""Dreaming"", by the same author, I thought I'd give this one a try. I felt like the plot had some potential at the very beginning, but after she got kidnapped the book went down really fast. There was no chemistry among the main characters, unless you count all the times he insulted her and was verbally abusive to her. I don't know how she could have fallen in love with him!! And when he called her a ""stupid b...."", and more than once, I almost couldn't believe it. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money.Skip this one."
5,Not the usual,"Different setting, different characters, very very funny. This book was a complete surprise. I cannot tell you how many times I laughed out loud. Lollie LaRue is so unexpected. Not a ditz as much as naive and unworldly, and she has a huge heart. Her sometimes silly, always funny, and often endearing journey into the jungle is so refreshing, dragging a reluctant edgy hero along with her. Sam was a great Humphrey Bogart/Spencer Tracy kind of hero, all gruff and rough but honest. I laughed and loved it! Race to read this one. It's a keeper!"
1,What a drag,"I deleted this one. After an interminable time of wandering in the jungle, river, and captivity with bugs, not to mention the whining and a hero who treated the heroine horribly, I could not take it. I tried to persist but it was too.... much. But the real kicker was the dialogue. This is a supposedly a time period romance but when they started cursing in current off-color vernacular I was done."
3,"Great setting and premise, annoying characters","In a genre where a dozen settings are done to death (Regency, Civil War, Western frontier...), it's really exciting to encounter a new setting. This is the first romance I've seen set in the Phillippines during the Civil War against the Spanish in 1896. So far, so good.Unfortunately, Jill Barnett (whose work I usually enjoy) mucks this up with two protagonists who I found pretty annoying. Lollie is such a ditz that her screw-ups go from funny to simply stupid. Sam is violent and mean. I had a hard time finding the chemistry between them.Still, this book was selected by Romantic Times as one of the 200 best romances since 1981 so other readers must enjoy it (just not me)."
3,Wasn't My Cup Of Tea,"I thought the writing was commendable the characters entertaining but this type of story wasn't for me. I don't go for violence/war plots and didn't realize a majority of the book revolved around it. Also as an animal lover I didn't like some abusive scenerios pointed out out regarding the island horses. If you don't like strong male dominance (her brothers, the hero and her father) you may want to steer clear of this book as well. I was glad to have gotten this as a free download, had I paid for it I would have been disapointed. Again this is only my personal preference I admire anyone who can write this well. Happy Reading enjoy."
2,A big disappointment,"I loved ""Dancing in the Shadows of the Moon"", and thus I looked forward with great anticipation to this book, but was extremely disappointed. ""Dancing"" was wild, fascinating, can't-put-it-down typed reading. This book was so boring that I put it down only a third of the way through, and it will be on its way to the used bookstore the next time I go. Very repetitous, not even remotely believable (and if all these 'Universal Beings"" were supposedly working on better ways of handling world conflict, well, look around, where's the evidence of that???) The wonderful characterizations of the previous book are gone, replaced by long-winded speeches, and dialog that sounds as if it could come from third-rate Star Trek episodes. And what happened to Machelle's trademark wit? I read ""Dancing"" three times and will probably read it more times yet--I wish I hadn't read this one at all."
3,"half a bottle, not what we needed","it doesn't hold a full bottle so no point in owning this. Its a nice looking piece, but will probably end up holding flowers and not wine.By the time I get to a half bottle, I don't need a decanter."
1,its not contra,if you think this will be like on the other contra its not even 2d its plays like space invaders with out the fun so if you think its contra its not you will be disappointed its a real bad game
1,It arrived DOA,"I ordered this item, it arrived DOA. They refunded the cost of the item but I had to pay the roundtrip postage of $9.00. Unless they improve their quality control, I would not order this item. You will save time and money by just going to the hardware store and buying one."
5,Prophet Women's Wash n Wear,this shoe is true to width. I need the extra wide shoe after some foot surgery. I have not attempted to wash these shoes but this is the second pair that I bought because they were so comfortable and held my inserts well
3,"3 stars for the brand, minus 2 stars for the appearance","I bought these since I found the wash and wear aspect intriguing. I have not yet washed these shoes but they are exceedingly WHITE - if you love blindingly white shoes, then these are for you. The comfort is good but Propet usually provides excellent comfort. What I did not like was how it look on my foot, it reminded me of a boat on my small foot. I don't like shoes that look big on my foot - I guess it makes me feel clumsy or dowdy. Anyway, if you are looking for a good walking shoe that is white and you can wash, go for it. I mainly purchased these because the price was too good to resist."
5,Wonderful!,"Hanukkah gift for my Father. A family favorite, so it was very well received and will be enjoyed over and over."
2,Disappointing if...,"purchased with the Zero Mostel version as a reference for how this music should sound. By comparison, the soundtrack version sounds, to me, relatively lifeless and without the Yiddish/Eastern-European passion and accents that made the original stage version such a wonderful and memorable hit. On the other hand, if you liked what you heard in the movie version (I had apparently forgotten what I heard!), then I am sure it is fine (no problems with the actual quality of the CD itself)."
1,unplayable,"The cd is badly scratched. I even tried to fix it with a cd product, but it is not playable. Very dissapointed."
1,Disappointed,Could not use tape of Fiddler on Roof in my new car because only CD's can be used. Decided to purchase CD. Received product. Sound was unclear. Wanted original stage production or movie verrsion. Got a special put together 30th anniversary edition. Returned product for credit. Still hoping to get CD version of one of my favorate musicals.
2,Fiddler on the Roof,"Although it is a good CD, I was looking for the soundtrack that matched up with the musical, which this does not."
5,Fabulous!,"Topol shines as Tevye and John Williams' orchestrations of Bock and Harnick's classic musical are incredible. Thirty years later, this release still has incredible merit. Extra tracks and some of Topol's incredible theatrical spoken monologues."
2,Too big,This ball is more suitable for a small dog - its way too big for a cat. My cat has wanted nothing to do with it.
2,Arrived in Pieces.,"Great Product. Poor Packaging.The large bowl arrived Shattered, But the small bowels were ok.I shouldn't have to tell a vendor to pack each Ceramic item in an individual box to prevent damage! Not dumped on top of each other in 1 box with a few inadequate layers of bubble wrap separating them.And to be honest, I didn't expect that large bowl to be so big.Overall I'm satisfied, But Buyer Beware."
3,Great Classic,"A must have for your collection as the first Tomb Raider game. This game can be a lot of fun with all the puzzles and different enemy types. I personally like it, but find the controls slow and sluggish. Though it's a great game in content it's not one I plan on finishing."
1,it was overlooked for a reason...,"first of all, this version was overlooked for a reason...it sucked!!!the playstation version was by far, and still is the best one ever madeand played...hands down.i cant remember the name of the level. but there's a level where a boulder comes rolling down after lara.well guesswhat...you cant hear it on the saturn version,wtf.then there's the problem with the lighting(in game).on the playstation version you walk up to these crystals,you can see your reflection in might i add.and save your game.saturn version,its just a dull a** looking crystal floating.so you see there is a reason this version was overlooked."
1,Venice Underground,"Well, i can't really review the dvd received, since i got a disc error when i went to play it , so it's basically useless to me.I had gotten the same disc error result when i had rented it from local video store;I was hoping that by ordering it , and buying it I would get one that worked, but apparently there is something wrong with that particular titled dvd."
3,OK but....,"We were given this as a birthday present. My 5 and 7 year old girls enjoy playing with the CDs. My Little Pony and Pet Shop are the favorites. Beware ... except for magic wardrobe, the games run very slowly. Definitely not the latest technology, but a good intro to the computer for little girls."
1,WTF?,"THAT IS SO SEXIST, FEMALE CAN PLAY WHATEVER GAMES THEY WANT AND WHEN PEOPLE MAKE A GAME SPECIFICLY FOR FEMALES, ITS SOME BARBIE.... I DONT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SMOKING WHEN THEY MADE THIS PRODUCT BUT IF THEY THINK THEY CAN SELL THIS PRODUCT WITH NOBODY YELLING AT THEM, I WANNA BUY SOME OF IT :-D."
1,More frustating than shuffling by hand,"It works about every other time! It's not just this brand, ALL card shufflers are made very poorly. We use three (3) decks of card for particular game and find it's almost less frustrating to mix by hand. Usually one side jams up per shuffle."
3,one OK and the other sent back,"I had ordered two, one for me and one for my friend. The one works great and the other the batteries kept falling out. The little trap door would not stay latched. I have sent it back for a replacement."
1,Unequal shuffling,This product does shuffle but the left side finishes about 15 cards before the right side and it will sometimes turn a card over and nearly always has a card or two standing up on the side walls.
3,"Works Okay, but Buy the Correct Batteries!","This is a fun little shuffler and works well enough for home use. Be aware though, that the box says it takes 4 AAA batteries when, in fact, it takes 4 AA batteries. I bought a nice big package of AAA batteries only to discover this truth after we were ready to start playing cards! Needless to say, I didn't appreciate needing to go out and buy more batteries before we could use it."
4,"Excellent film; as depressing as Dickens, though.","This is an artistic film with excellent directing and screenplay. The film has a brownish tint which enhances the fact that the events in the film happen in the past. I found it just about as depressing as Dickens portrayal of industrial England, but if you enjoy good films (as opposed to movies), I highly recommend it. After all, Bergman's films are generally pretty depressing, but the man is a genius. This film does not achieve the quality of Bergman's work, but, what does?"
3,Great movie but....,"I don't especially like a story where they show the dark side of a family life. Here, we see the unbelievable violence of a husband towards his wife and children and it is hearbreaking to watch. Swedish movies are often gloomy and depressing like this one. It is one thing to be poor, but having to deal with violence on top of that well, this is too much for me. The father's behavior is despicable and we don't understand how his wife managed to cope with it and even forgave him. Darkness at its best here!"
3,Cool stuff!!!,"I'm impressed of the design. I like the ideal of using disc instead of tape form. Waste no time for rewind/forward. Of course, the function r veri limited. Perhaps Sony should seriously re-evaluate the next disc cam in the near future. Hope that they launch 2nd generation mini-disc cam have IEEE or usb support, lower the price of the mini disc. Current disc data allow only 20mins of visual recording r really short. I am convince the disc can be compressed to higher grade. Depending on Ethernet port r not a veri ideal. Feature r great but concept r still veri conventional. Despite of this, this set has the x-factor. Great for taking lots of still pictures.."
1,Interact Memory Card Plus (Sega Saturn),"HUGE disappointment! Purchased used, will never purchase from this seller again. Card did not work, big waste of money. Would have been nice to know that the memory card actually worked before we purchased."
5,Great,The Neca head knockers are a great collectible item and I have numerous. The detail is fantastic and they look great.
5,Great introduction . . .,"Anyone who loves experimental heavy rock a la Mike Patton, Incubus, Primus, Zappa, etc., will LOVE the Cardiacs and others (affectionate friends) included on this much-needed CD."
5,Superb Cuisine from a Great Chef,"This massive cookbook is well worth the investment. Excellent and easy to follow recipes have delighted our family and friends. The Homestead is a grand historic resort, and the information about its culinary operations is fascinating. Chef Schnarwyler makes the world of French sauces easy to understand with great diagrams and clear descriptions. Outstanding color photographs of this beautiful resort throughout the seasons, and of the grand food, are a bonus. This has quickly become one of our favorite cookbooks!"
5,love it!,"I was flipping the channels and i heard an awesome beat and i stopped to listen. The song was called ""Unconditional"" by The Bravery....i never even heard of them before! Go to their website and you can listen to some of their songs (FULL VERSION....worth it. They are kind of like the killers w/more of an 80s beat. Hey, it's dance rock"
3,for fans of Benny Benassi or filter disco,"this straightforward single includes the original mix of Unconditional, with vocals reminiscent of the Cure, and a rockin' alternative new wave retro feel. The one and only remix runs 6 minutes, and Benassi remixes to current dance standards, giving it a filter disco mix that totally alters all the vocals. Most fans of the style of music the Bravery records won't really go for it, but if you have a wide variety of tastes, you'll probably enjoy it."
3,A Real Mixed Bag,"A very bizarre mixture of tracks make up this chillout compilation. They range from very good ambient electronica tracks to very bad elevator- sounding music to theme songs from TV shows (i.e. The X-Files) and movies. Too many dud tracks to recommend this as a must have chillout album, but it is still on par with a lot that is out there. Highlights include: ""Slip Into Something More Comfortable"", ""At The River"", ""American Dream"", and ""Porcelain"".3/5 stars."
4,Synchronicity,"In search of the Jung at Heart song that soundtracked the Jetta commercial ""Synchronicity"", this was the only album I could find that had it. I like about half of the other songs too. I wouldn't consider the whole album as classic chillout music. Personally I think the selection of titles, although all low key, is too diverse in genre to keep my mood chilled out. Basically, the album needs a little synchronicity..."
4,Psycho story of Southern Asia,Hong Kong boss (Mafiosi as local filmmakers provide usually?) fathered a son and knowing his wife has got affairs with her bodyguard is a good excuse to get rid of her to clear a way to a new passion.Depicting actions from this bodyguard viewpoint and events he became involved in is a plot of this cynic drama.
2,I beg to differ,"Unfortunately, this collection suffers from the same ailment as a lot of ""best of"" compilations -- atrocious editing. Great tunes such as ""Rain in the Summertime"" and ""Sold Me Down the River"" are so hacked up it's hard to enjoy them at all. The latter in particular is reduced to a fade-out ending instead of the hammering guitar chord that closed out the original recording. If you really like The Alarm, caveat emptor! Personally, I'm going to go find the original CDs of the albums and trade this thing in at my local music store."
2,Where the hell is ........ ?,"I'll be precise and to the point - ""WHERE IN THE HELL IS 'DEVOLUTION WORKING MAN BLUES' ???????? apparently not on this cd !!!foxwell"
4,Perfect for people starting to eat right,"I quit cooking good meals many years ago and existed on food that was delivered, frozen, drive thru, snack and cereal. Needless to say my weight and health went to pot. I began cooking about a year ago and have found this book to be a great help. The recipes are varied, have pictures and easy instructions and calorie, fat (including sat fat), cholesterol, sodium, carb, fiber and protein breakdown. They are well organized by groups and on the whole are good though not gourmet. That's OK with me as I pull myself out of unhealthy bad habits and speed is of the essence. I turn frequently to this cookbook although I have now accumulated about 100 other cookbooks. This book is often used when I make my weekly menus - another new behavior which is helping me financially and physically."
5,Great for busy families or when you need a quick meal.,"This cookbook offers many recipes for meals taking under one hour to prepare(most under 30 minutes). Each recipe comes with prep time, cook time and nutritional information. The pictures are full page and in color. Wonderful!"
1,Not the Betty Crocker of days gone by!,"I learned to cook and bake following the recipes from Betty Crocker's Cookbook from 1950, so I have always expected good things from a Betty Crocker cookbook. This one however, severely disappionts. Lots of the recipes seem to keep repeating each other just by changing a pasta type for example. All the recipes that I looked at seemed to call for expensive preprepped convenience items from the store. Most of which I would never keep routinely in the house. Most of the recipes I couldn't get my hubby to eat nor would I be interested in them. I'm sure that many people would love this book,but I'm not one of them after being taught to cook from scratch by Betty Crocker."
1,Too Small,I wouldn't call these 18 oz bowls because when I put one on my counter and filled it with 18 oz of water some of the water spilled over onto the counter. They are more like dessert bowls than soup or cereal bowls.
4,Great Chapter Book for Beginning Readers,"Marvin Redpost is a third-grader at Dogwood Elementary School. This week has been a specialweek at Dogwood Elementary. Everyday they have worn something outrageous such as socks that do not match, and today is ""hole day"". Every one,including the teacher and principal,is wearing clothes with holes in them. The only problem is that there is going to be a suprise visit from the President of the United States.This is a great chapter book for beginning readers. Even though the language is simple,LouisSachar makes an interesting and humorous tale that young readers will enjoy. Marvin Redpost and the other kids in Mrs. North's third-grade class are characters that almost any young reader will identify with and enjoy reading about."
4,Marvin Redpost book review,"Marvin is a third grader in Mrs.North's class. Their school is kind of like our school because they have something like our spirit week. It was hole day at their school. The principal came in to tell Mrs. North that he needed to speak with her. When Mrs. North came back, her mouth dropped and her eyes got bigger every second. The class was quiet. Mrs. North told them some weird news. She said that the President of the United States was going to come to their class. Mrs. North reviewed their classroom guidelines and manners. When the President arrived, they were all embarrassed, especially Mrs. North and Marvin. Mrs. North had holes in her clothes and Marvin was doing a math problem on the blackboard in front of the class and the President. Marvin went blank, then it came back. When he was done the President talked to the class about being a good citizen. We liked this book a lot because we thought it was cool that the President of the United States visited Marvin's class."
3,Class President,"In the great book Class President it is hole day and every body has holes in their clothes. Marvin's class found out that the president is coming to his class. Reporters rush in to get the president on TV! The Pesident came to teach them how to be a good ciizen, so they might be president some day. To know more about this great book buy it."
4,great third person shooter,"I personally dont like third person shooters, i think the controls are awkward but to me this game was sort of in between a first person and third person shooter and was one of the best budget shooters i have played. just a really fun game to play, you cant go wrong if you get this game for 5 bucks."
3,Cheese story but Good fun!,"Even though the actual story dialogue to this game is kinda cleche and at some points, overstylized, but the actual gameplay itself is pretty fun. Good way to kill some time.Graphics are decent in gameplay, cinematic graphics lacked a lot of next-gen animation such as facial characteristics and realistic bodily movements. Not a lot of work was put into this game.Overall, this game is a good timekiller and nothing more. Also, those with Physics cards get a great graphical and interactive boost since this game is compatable with Ageia PhysX."
5,WHAT A HELPFUL BOOK!!,"I couldn`t imagine a book on the subject of food combining being more comprehensive and at the same time a quick, easy read! I love this little book-my whole family has read it and is now doing food combining! I`ve lost a few pounds although that was not my mail motivation; I totally recommend this to anyone interested in the subject!! M Murphy"
3,food combining book,"I didn't realize that ""in a nutshell"" meant a very small version of probably a larger book. But could have been me for not reading into it. Also this seems to be a European book since some of the food references are not items we have here. Other than that, nice informative little book. The size of it actually makes it an easy book to carry around if you are just learning about food combining. So overall, I am satisfied with the book. Would be a bit nicer if there was a version with different foods though to give more realistic ideas."
5,amazing...,"This highlights the original season of one of the best shows to ever be on TV. It is a entertaining and wonderful view into the world of fraggle rock, a show that while still being entertaining promoted peace and the saving of the enviorment all around the world in its own original way w/out the viewer knowing it. One word can describe it, amazing... I hope someday these wonderful shows can be avalible again."
1,Pre Dummies,"This book can best be regarded as a primmer for the Dummies series. After a lot of misspent money I have found a combination that works quite well (if the subjects are covered), that is starting with the Visual Quickstart Guides, and for greater depth Que's `Using' preferably the Special Edition as you get the complete book on CD too."
1,SCAM,"This cream does not contain any placental tissue or palmitate. It is petrolatum,Talc. They are full of wrong ingredients in it. Including dye.Please dont buy this.I just did not like the idea that seller is not telling the truth. A lot of people don't mind petrolatum or talc but at least be honest. I have returned the item after buying it. Shocked to see none of the ingredients listed present there."
2,durable but scuffable,"my girlfriend bought me this watch and i love it, but my work environment isn't very suitable for watches so it sits in my pocket a lot (with my keys). the band has suffered a bit of damage (all cosmetic) but still holds strong, and the face of the watch seems to be the most scratch/scuff resistant.update: I forgot about this review or I would've updated it earlier, but about 3 weeks after I got the watch the battery died, so we got it replaced. I don't know if it was the watch or the guys who repaired it, or just the construction of the watch itself, but it crapped out hard. Changed the battery again and still nothing, then the second hand fell off somewhere between changes. It sits in my closet somewhere now since I have given up on it"
3,Need the book for full experience.,You really need to buy the book to take advantage of this. It should have just been packaged this way. Content is good and exercises are okay. I wish there were more examples included to give you parallel ideas.
3,really thick,"The wire is true 14 gauge which is good ,but the insulation is too thick and running it through notched joist is a pain. The insulation a really soft too most insulated wire is made from a harder compound that inst as think . But the product works just harder to work with."
4,Good Binocular,"I received my Celestron 12 x 60mm binoculars yesterday, and I have to say that I was a little disappointed at first. I looked up at Jupiter and I could see little specs for the moons, but the problem was that I saw two of everything. The collimation was really bad making astronomy use nearly impossible. I searched the web on how to collimate binoculars and found a couple of sites. I held the binoculars up pointed at a star and turned the collimation screws (once I found them) and was finally able to get them fixed to one point.Now with the collimation done, I am able to see what I want. I am definitly able to see Jupiter's moons. I can also see the Andromeda Galaxy and several star clusters. For little money this makes a good complement to my telescope.I would recommend the binoculars, but for astronomical use, be prepared to collimate."
4,The Inspectors 2,"Great follow up to ""The Inspectors"". If you enjoyed it, you will definitely want to catch this one. I bought both based on reviews here at Amazon and I was not disappointed. Quite the contrary in fact. I found both movies very enjoyable entertainment. The acting is great, and the story, directing, and camera work are first rate. This movie revolves around identity theft. A ring of identity thieves is uncovered when one accidentally dies in a car accident. The investigation unfolds to a leader that is not only smart but deadly. I truly wish this had been a TV series or they made more movies. I think there are many more stories that could be told about the United States Postal Inspectors. This is another Showtime movie with good production values. Excellent quality DVD and great replayability."
4,cut above the rest.,"wonderful sequel that is way better then most in that it has a whole knew story but keeps the characters in tact. Silverman, best known for his comic roles, adds realism to Gossit's tough-guy. Madsen is so freaky in movies that he was the perfect choice. Had this movie been made 20-30 years ago I bet they would have cast Anthony Perkins in it. the film is visually more intresting then before with and the story is much scarier then before.Great Thriller."
5,great movie,Louis Gosset Jr is outstanding in this movie. This movie is a classic. I encourage all of you to purchase it and sit back and enjoy everthing out it. My DVD player UP-converts; thus this really looked wonderful.The Inspectors 2 - A Shred of Evidence
4,A fun and instructive intro to yoga for kids.,"This video was very creative in having the children pretend to be different animals to get them into some common yoga poses, along with the instructor and other children of various ages. The only drawback is the instructor herself, I found her voice (tone not accent) and facial expression (she only has one) a little strange, at times distracting from the exercise, even my four year old commented on the strange lady. We've only done it once, so I'm hoping she'll get accustomed to it and be able to focus more on doing the poses which are presented with a great technique."
1,BAD luck for me,I bought this item and shipped it over seas when i received it it was broken the zoom did not work at all returning this binocular would coast me $80 since i am over seas wish that this company would check their items before shipping and selling them . i also bought the bushnell h2o 10x42 along with this one it was perfect and works great if you are looking for some thing you can rely on i would recommend the H2O .
1,Un-happy,Misleading discription of product. Was stated that binoculars were 10x50. They were actually 10x42. Unhappy with misleading discription of product. Would not do business with again do to dishonest dealing.
5,Yummie :-D,"As a major salmon lover, this is a fantastic book. It makes my mouth water just thinking of the gorgeous recipes inside (and the pictures). I never knew there were this many ways of cooking with salmon. There are stunning soups and heaps of other healthy treats here.The ones I've tried so far are the Spicy Salmon Samosas With Chilli Tomato Dip, Salmon and Goats' Cheese Tart with Tomato and Basil Salad, Smoked Salmon Pate with Classic Melba Toast and the Hot Smoked Salmon Chowder. They have all turned out great and they were easy to make because Nick has written this in a clear and concise way so that each recipe is easy to follow.It's a beautiful hardcover book that is easy to use (has prep times and amount that each dish will serve) and would make a great gift or a nice treat for yourself if you are also a salmon lover. Even if you aren't, there are so many variations here, that you'll maybe turn into one."
5,Great thoughtful Science Fiction,"Don't be put off by the slightly lame and generic-sounding synopsis presented for these books. The Hellflower trilogy is well worth reading. What starts off in ""Hellflower"" as a fairly formulaic 'fiercely independent space smuggler stumbles into dangerous political conspiracy' matures in the next two books into a very thoughtful and empathetic story about human beings, their relationships, and human loyalty. Some of the slightly cheesy devices that Shahar uses in ""Hellflower"" to create the ambiance are dropped as the series progresses, and the story ends up being bloody great sci-fi. If you can find all three books, read them and treasure them."
5,great reception,I'm getting great HDTV reception with this antenna. About 10 miles from the transmission towers.
3,Phillips antenna,Arrived very quickly. It had some damage on one of the elements. It went together very easily. It did not solve my problem but I may be asking too much of it.
2,Ordered the wrong one,Site wasnt clear that this antenna could or couldnt be used for HDTV. Ordered in error. Amazon confirmed that it wasnt used for HDTV.
3,It works,"It works. I have it hanging inside my apartment as I live in a bad spot for Digital TV reception. I wish I could stick it out side but that is against the rules. It was about thirty bucks or less than one month of Cable, I get 23 channels.;)"
4,Great but . . .,This is a great product - especially for the price. I do agree with the reviews that I read though that the directions were not very good. I like many that reviewed it ended up looking at the picture to put it together. Other than that I would recommend it.
5,Wonderful product until..........,"This was a wonderful product until they decided to change it from the Backpack fabric in a solid color into a plaid. Where this used to be a great product for us who do real day hikes in the real outdoors it now looks like a stylish product for a day hike on Rodeo or 5th Avenue. Not a product for the serious hiker any longer. Now a product for the serious trendy shopper.I challenge the company to make both, one for the serious outdoors person and this for the serious shopper!"
3,"Nice case, crappy band.","The look and feel of the case is fine, it is the band that is really cheap. If this retails for $265 it should have solid links not the inferior folded stamped steel. Taking out a couple if links was a real pain even with a full set of tools. A good quality leather or even rubber watch band would help the looks and reduce the distraction of the low quality band."
5,I Love this Rack,"I Love this roof rack. This one is replacing the same kind I've had on my Jeep for the last 11 years.. I ran into my garage with saw horses in it. The only thing that's going to take out this roof rack is going to be a low ceiling! I've had BBQ grills, Large coolers, wood, Mattresses, etc. strapped on it with not one problem. The box did arrive falling apart and mostly open to my front door, but that's UPS. All of the parts were accounted for. I would definately buy again and reccomend! Oh, make sure to call Surco to find out the Exact mounting brackets you need for YOUR vehicle, because thay have the Wrong pictures to go with the different brackets. I had to return the first set of brackets, but got the correct ones and it's great now!"
4,Easily assembled,Easy to assemble. Seems well made. I like that it is aluminum and the hardware is stainless. Bolted it directly to the Thule load bars on my Land Cruiser.
4,I love Phoenix,"I have been a Phoenix fan for a while, I have all their studio albums and seen them live twice. It was excellent to finally get a copy of their live recording. The quality of the recording is great, although there seems to be a lack of cohesion between the tracks, because most of them are recorded from different shows. All in all, the songs are great, especially the updated Run Run Run, Funky Squaredance and If I Ever Feel Better.A good live album."
2,Best Band Ever: Horrible LIVE,"United is the best produced album in the world. Alphabetical is not bad. But Phoenix need their slick production to work. Live they are a joke. This is like a bad highschool band show. Listen to fnky squaredance live and you will hate Phoenix, which you shouldn't since they are awesome. so don't listen to this crap. just listen to united again."
2,Great microwave until...,We finally retired our Kenmore microwave purchased in 1984 and bought this Daewoo model. I wanted convection/grilling capability since I hate reheating certain foods like pizza in a conventional microwave.After about 3 months of ownership we noticed that the door handle was loosening up. It got progressively worse and is now to the point where the handle is ready to fall off. There is no way to tighten it because the door is totally sealed.We called the Daewoo support number and since we don't live anywhere near a service center they were at a loss as to what to do. They talked about sending us a new unit and then they sent us just the door! I would change it if I had the right tools but you need a special torx bit with a hollow center to take the cover off.
4,George Borowski - 'Check Out Guitar George' (Ozit),"Good offering from this talented Manchester songwriter and guitarist. George Borowski may not be a household name but he's gigged around a bit - he played on the Dire Strait's classic ""Sultans Of Swing"" + he's worked with Sad Cafe and Meatloaf before. As I've spinned this CD a number of times, it sort of grew on me after the second time I heard it. Tunes I liked best include the worthy ""Just Surviving"", ""Say Your Prayers"", ""Cecil Road"", ""The Pin"" and the upbeat / should-have-been a hit ""Who Is Innocent"". Might appeal to (I'm second guessing here) Mark Knopfler, John Hiatt and George Harrison. A fine pick."
5,Perhaps the greatest anime series ever made...,"Too many lengthily reviews going into quite a bit of depth about this amazing series so I'll spare you the read.This is perhaps one of the best (and most well done) animes ever made. I would buy the entire series if you have the money or try renting the first episode to see if it appeals to you (if it does, buy the series outright).I realize that my response might seem as though I'm a die hard-fan instead of one qualified mentally to give an objective review... the truth is, well I am a die hard fan and you will be to if you give Last Exile a try! A++++"
4,Quick overview,"A story of growth and adventure. Two friends are also flying buddies in a world where flight is the main form of transport. They take on a difficult mission that lands them into the thick of a great war. As they struggle to stay alive, they meet new friends and learn how to cope with their own choices."
3,Nice for teens and young adults,"I know I am in the minority but I was not impressed by this series. My main beef is that all of the crucial characters are under 19 years of age with the exception of Capitain Rowe who was only 28, so you have to suffer through alot of teen and young adult angst and shallowness which was quite annoying. There just seemed a lack of depth that you tend to get with older more experienced characters. I know this is the Japanese obsession with youth but after awhile you want to slap them upside their heads. The animation is pretty good. They were especially adept at combining the CGI and traditional animation techniques. The general plot of ""world in turmoil, world saved by 'special' child"" is typical anime. It is entertaining however I would not recommend spending $150 on it. It is nothing new. Rent instead."
3,Note quite there,"I loved how this series started off. Good first half, but the second half just wasn't as strong. Still not bad, but not great. If you've nothing else to watch then check this out."
2,Not exactly what I ordered,"When the Zils arrived I was extremely disappointed. Instead of ornate decorations engraved along the outside of the zil as the photo depicted, I received simple, plain looking brass finger cymbals."
2,not impressed,"I have dry skin and am getting to the age where I need to do more to protect against wrinkles. I bought this as a smaller sample from Sephora and I am happy for that -- because once it is gone, I will never purchase it again. There is nothing spectacular about this moisturizer. It is not luxurious in feel, it does not quench my often dry skin ( I generally have to follow up with my regular moisturizer which is produced by philosophy. I find the moisturizer is not readily absorbed by my skin and leaves a greasy appearance post application. For this price, I think you can find something better--especially for the gals out there with really dry skin"
2,was ok,As a moisturizer it was just o.k... nothing fantastic. It did nothing for anti-aging and I only have fine lines around my eyes. I think Clinique dramatically different lotion is just as good.
2,Whale of a Tale!,"I visited Caledesi Island last month and the tour guide mentioned this book so I ordered it. I found it to be a semi interesting piece of fiction. A nine year old girl rowing a boat across those waters twice a day - um, I don't think so. Our tour boat operator had a time getting the boat over to the island and this little girl did it every day, twice a day? I also had the impression that she neither liked or respected her husband from the way she wrote about him. It came across more of a love story for her father and the island.See if you can get your library to find you a copy before you buy it. Twenty dollars is nineteen dollars too much for this book."
5,Paradise on earth,"I read this great little book a few years ago. It is a heart warming story of a women's love affair with a beautiful Florida island that has been saved from development, and is now a park.Myrtle Betz moved to the island with her father when she was a small child, and grew up there rowing a small boat to school on the mainland each day.If you love Old Florida you will enjoy this book. You may be inspired to take a trip to this beautiful unspoiled park."
2,BAD IF YOU PLAN TO TAKE THE Project+ Exam!,"I enjoyed this book from the stand point of learning about the IT Project Management role. If was wasy to read and very informative. However this book DOES NOT help prepare you for the actual CompTia Project+ exam. Even though I passed I felt like I was taking the wrong test. The verbage in the test questions is nothing like the book or the practice exam. There were words on the test that were never covered in this book. My advice if you want to learn about IT Project Management this is a good book. If you want to pass the CompTia's exam, please find another book"
5,"IT Project Management: On Track from Start to Finish, Second Edition (Certification Press)","Good book, easy to read and understand, lots of information, will make a good book to hold onto and use for reference."
2,incoherent thoughts,"Okay, I read this book end-to-end. Disappointing though. The contents are not close to what you find in the Project+ exam. The heading, subheading and paragraphs are not coherent and they do not tie together. It is hard to find out, in few paragraphs, what author is trying to tell. Chapter summaries are disorganized and sometime do not cover what is in the chapter. Some of the figures do not make sense (see figure 6-5 on page 189...do you really need to create a figure to tell Arguments take a project off schedule and increase costs)."
1,"Good place to start, HORRIBLE test preperation aid!",I felt like I was taking the wrong test! I definitely used the wrong book to prep for the test. The CompTIA test uses almost an entirely different set of terms.
4,gives numerous specific tasks for you to manage,"This text is for the technical manager. It breaks down your project management duties into narrower, more specific tasks. Like putting together a project team. Which involves determining what tasks need to be tackled, and finding those people qualified to do so.Project planning is shown using various graphical approaches like network diagrams. These and other types of graphs are vital in letting you plan a schedule and then measure adherence to it.Quality is also prominently discussed. There are suggestions on how to measure these in the deliverables. Unlike manufacturing, this can be difficult. The book only touches upon the complexities here. You should look elsewhere for a more thorough analysis of quality measurement."
3,Not enough to pass the Project+ exam,"This book has a lot of great content. If grading on content alone, I'd give it a 4 out of 5. It would have been better if the book was better organized: begin with beginning stage of project and cary on through to the end.If grading on whether it helped me pass the Comptia Project+ exam, I'd give it a 2 out of 5.Perhaps back in 2005 when this book became public, the exam was similar to the book. Now it is not. The book only covers a 1/2 of the material.I passed the exam only because I read the above book in conjunction with reading other books such as: Rita's PMP exam prep."
5,Wonderful book,"I came accross this book in the early '90s after I was nearly crippled by arthritis in my arms and shoulders. After followng Dr. Mandell's guidelines for an elimination diet to identify possible food allergies, I found that members of the gourd family (squash, melons, etc.) caused me severe joint pain. Eliminating this food group from my diet resulted in the complete elimination of joint pain within 30 days. I have remained free of arthritis symptoms for many years now. In addition, my general mood improved. This book changed my life."
5,Exelent product,That's exactly what I was looking for. They have excellent grip to handel any size of boxes. Shame Icouldn't fined to byuy them in any stores.
1,NOT FOR BOX HANDLING!!,I move 1000+ boxes everyday for my job. I received these gloves yesterday. Not even 1 hour into my shift the synthetic hex-grip began to fall apart! Obviously these gloves are not for box handling...
2,Anything but package handler's gloves,"Unfortunately I don't have many good things to say about these gloves. As far as comfort, flexibilty, and overall fit I would rate these gloves a 5. However, as far as being called package handler gloves I think you should change the name of these. I am a true package handler for one of our major shipping companies. These gloves did not stand up to the boxes. Within the first week I had no rubber grips left on the palms and finger tips. Within the first month I already had holes in a few of the fingertips. I have owned these gloves just over a month and they are no longer any use to me. END"
2,not a real package handler glove,"I work as a delivery driver for one of the parcel companies, handling about 2,000 packages a week. These gloves did not last three weeks, and by that time the fingertips had serverd and a nice hole developed at the palms. I can't imaging how they would last in-building where 5,000 pieces are handled in one night. Surely Ironclad could have developed this glove with feedback and field testing from actual box handlers before labeling them as such."
1,"What can i say, sucks!","The gloves worked for the fist few week, say 3 weeks. soon after that the finger tips started to rip and peel off, keep in mind I was very active handling packages with UPS so i would know best. my fingertips were expose and no longer protected, every package i handled kept sliping and hit the ground. Not strong or havy duty. it's not even that.not worth the money."
3,OK,"I USED THEM FOR FOOD SERVICE DELIVERY, WITCH WAS VERY HARD ON THEM. BUT FOR THE MONEY I THINK I WOULD LOOK FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
4,Durability,"I tried lots of other brands before I found iron clad. Now I only buy iron clad they seem to have the best fit and durability. I'm a forklift driver so I wear them while I drive , but I also get off my lift to stock wrap boards ect. I the only thing that could be improved for me is the durability in the finger tips , other than that a great work glove ."
3,Touchy,"Just got this item, it works well however it is very touchy. To make the scale work it takes several tries before you get the 0.00 then you can step on."
1,Save your money,Piece of junk. Isn't accurate and your weight will change from one minute to the next! I purchased this on December 19 and will be returning before January 1...
5,I love this scale,"I received this scale and I love it. Due to my weight I have had problems finding a scale capable of registering my weight,this scale weights up to 380lbs. This scale allows you to see every pound you've lost because it displays your weight in 0.1 lb increments. This scale is great for people who weigh over 330lbs which is the average weight allotment for most scales. Try it you'll like it!!!"
3,"Looking for an accurate scale or one to keep you ""on track""?","I once read that if you want to measure weight loss you should weigh yourself every week, if you want to measure weight maintance you should weigh yourself every day. Well either way this scale will be all over the map. Although I liked it for its ease of use, size and looks, I do not feel confident that it is accurate on a consistent basis. Mind you it's not off a lot maybe just a pound or three but if you're in the weight loss mode it doesn't work as well as if you're using it weekly. Either way I'm getting benifit, it does help me keep on track but I do keep in mind it's limited accuracy."
3,Larger than what you see,I was expecting the dial to be a bit small since I was getting it for someone with a narrow hand. The picture looked promising - but it isn't the case - it is like any other big watch.
2,Small price small watch,It is a inexpensive watch but you get what you pay for. It is to light to wear and feels like a womens watch.
5,Nice accessory,This adapter allows you to use M42 thread lenses in K Pentax cameras. Also include a key to easy attach-detach. Be sure to set camera to manual first to use non K lens.Everything was fine but adapter is silver not black as indicated.
4,OutLaw XXX Tennis,"This is a good game tight & smooth controls but the animated gestures in the game sales sex, you can turn them off in the option menu if children are present. Just remember this is an adult title watching the ladies will somehow make you feel naughty."
5,A Must Have Book for Crystal Developers,"If you are a Crystal Reports Developer, this book is a must have. Not only is it a great teaching resource, but it also make an awesome reference. It's loaded with thought provoking questions and exercises. I've currently got five Crystal books on my bookshelf here at work. The ONLY one I refer to is this one. This book is also outstanding for someone new to Crystal, as long as you have some IT background. If you are completely new to programming/reporting, this book will be very useful to you eventually, but it's not a good book for your level."
3,2x VS 4x,"It is extremely important that you know exactly what type of DVD-RW's you're buying - this listing should be more specific. I was just given a Samsung VHS / DVD Recorder and it lists very, very specific DVD's that the unit accepts (IE: It takes Sony DVD-R 4x, but it won't take a Sony DVD-RW!) AND... It only accepts 2x DVD-RW's! I made four trips back and forth to Staples just to find out they didn't have the specific brand name that I needed & I eventually found the Maxell DVD-RW 2x @ a not so local Sears Electronic store. Read your directions closely."
5,Best in baking,"They are good in cereal (Bob's Red Mill Muesli for instance) but are best in baking. I put half a cup or a cup in Hodgson Mill Whole Wheat Gingerbread Mix and the result is outstanding. Try the dates, fig pieces and dried apple pieces (all from Bob's) in the gingerbread too. Absolutely wonderful and it keeps for days.For snacking, whole pitted dates are much tastier."
2,Not great,"I use dates in my oatmeal and these are the worst ones I have ever tasted.The oat flour coating is definitely not a light dusting, and the flavor is only OK.Also, the pieces range in size from the tiniest speck to a big chunk.However, I think these could be good in date nut bread, and other baked goods."
2,good company--ok product,I don't care for the flour coating on them and they are not very sweet like other raw dates--prefer mejool dates(wild oats brand is good)
3,Bob's Red Mill Dae Pieces,"Good packaging. Have the sunflower, sesame, flaxseed and wheat gern from Bob's Red Mill, all of which are very good. However, the date pieces would be tastier if they were slightly bigger. They are very small and rolled in flour and this cuts down on their flavor. I bought them primarily to use as a snack. Have seen similar date pieces in homes that look like very tiny short sausages. Unfortunately I don't know the brand."
5,Still Saving Lives,"""I have come to work on you like a drug or a chisel"" wrote the late Audre Lorde. Her passing created a hollow space in my soul that is now full again, thanks to Audre Lorde. Despite the fact that 'Sister Outsider' is assigned in virtually every women's studies and gender studies 101, do not think it is dry, ultimately a mere 'academic' book. Audre Lorde lived in and for a radical poetics and a radical pedagogy. If you have not discovered her work yet, please get a hold of a copy. It might save your life the way it saved mine, and I am white, male and straight, with a fierce hatred of white supremacy, patriarchy, and homophobia. But never mind my repeating a mantra you have heard, simply read this book as soon as possible."
5,The best,Certainly the best debate ever produced about the existence of nuclear weapons and its distribution around the world. Highly recomended!
2,Not Thrilling,"I picked up this book because I saw that the author was local to my home town (Santa Cruz, Calif). Although I had trepedations because I noted the book is self-published, I gave it a try. On the good side, it was written with some skill. Chapters were short and it did move along. I found the author's knowledge of the Catholic Church convincing. My primary criticism is that I found myself playing the game of trying to figure out who-done-it. The characters did not sustain interest and the plot was a bit one-dimensional. The book tries to create a hard talking, hard driving private eye whose character comes out as stiff and contrived. Finally, at the end of the book, I was left with only the solved mystery (which I had, unfortunately already guessed) and not much else. Wait, that is not right... I did come away with an appreciation for editors and the job that should have been done one this wanna-be thriller."
1,Terry Brejla falsifies reviews,"Teryy Brejla is a FAKE. My maiden name is Kristin Erlingsson. As you will note below, Terry Brejla falsified my name and wrote a review on my behalf without my knowledge. I just happened to chance upon it doing a google search of my maiden name. This man is a fake and should be ashamed to falsify reviews and profiles. (Terry was a freelancer at an advertising agency I worked at). Terry, if you read this, how dare you."
5,OnThat Day Again,I am 6 years old and this book was easy for mee to read. I didn't want to read it at first because the planes and the towers scare me. I'm still scared but I know I can do things to make the world better and baby children won't have to be scared again like I am. The colors in the book need to be better. the blue was really purple. all of the pictures were beautiful. The World Trade Center picture helps me remember how beautiful it was. All my friends read this book and feel better about the world.
3,Ghost soldier,"Ghost SoldierThere is a boy named Alexander whose Mom left him many years ago, he still waits for her day by day year by year to come back. He expects her to just come walking down the street one day but that hasn't happened yet. So Alexander is forced to live with his Dad in North Carolina, that is the last place he wants to be. The one-day Alexander finds himself in the center of the Civil War battlefield. There is where he meets Richeson, the ghost of a Civil War soldier. Richeson has problems of his own. Alexander doesn't care at all. Alexander can barely take care of himself let alone ghost from the past. Alexander is put into a mystery 100 years old. I didn't really enjoy this book because I don't really like ghost stories and it was kind of hard to follow. Him and his dad are trying to get along with each other through about the whole story. It gets hard to follow. I wouldn't really recommend this book to everyone."
1,A Good Book,"Ghost Soldier is a perrty good book. If you like ghost stories. The book deals with the Civil War. Ghost Soldier is not the best story to read. I think the book could of been longer. That is the only thing I don`t like about the book. The story takes place in North Carolina. the main person in the story is Alexander. I like the story just because, it deals with ghost. It all depends on what you like to read. You may like reading Ghost Soldieror you may notlike it."
2,Not Pleased with this Motion Sensor,"Ordered as a replacement to a broken sensor. It arrived and did not work at all. I have three of these and the outdoor light. I am not at all happy with the setup. Range is limited, sensors do not detect consistantly, and the light remains on at times(all night). A problem with the light fixture is that it will not fit a floursent bulb. Do yourself a favor and forget about these. Get a RAB motion sensor light - They work!"
5,Brilliant Feminist Overview,"This is a brilliant intervention in the study of American literature written by one of the smartest, women academics out there. Wonderful in its contextualization of 19th-century American women writers, this book is well-organized, comprehensive and lively. Please don't be daunted by fact-checker wannabes. This is great stuff, for both students and those who would like a women writers compendium on hand."
1,Caveat lector: do NOT buy this book,"I began reading this book with great anticipation, looking forward to a pleasant evening learning more about a sadly-neglected subject; women's writing in 19th century America.About two thirds down the first page of the historical timeline, one eyebrow went up. Three seconds later the other eyebrow joined the first eyebrow. By page 20 I was ready to ask for my money back.This book is riddled with so many errors of fact, grammar and spelling (a character in one of Mrs. E.D. E. N. Southworth's novels is described as ""fighting duals"")that I can't believe it made it past the fact-checker and the copy-editor. I have to ask myself the question: If the editors couldn't be bothered to catch these minor, silly mistakes, how can I have any confidence that the rest of the information they are imparting is accurate?Messrs Bauer and Gould should be ashamed of themselves for allowing such a slipshod piece of work to make it into print."
4,Relaxing,"I enjoyed this CD alot. Love songs of this period - 20's, 30's and 40's has always been a favorite of mine. I particularly enjoyed hearing one of the female voices - I believe it was Alynda Bonham - reminds me of my old school days - can't wait to hear if this group puts out another CD soon !"
1,ROCKIN PNEUMONIA,This CD contains the songs we want but the sound quality is terrible. I have many enhanced CD's of music from the fiftys and before and most of them manage to achieve pretty good sound quality. These people didn't even try. I Give it two thumbs down.
1,Not what was described,"Just received package yesterday. According to the product information on the page, This was to be the entire mounting, swivel arm and laptop holder. My order was for RAM-VB-108-SW1. What I got:RAM-VB-108. This is just the base. Could have bought it direct from RAM mounting systems for less money if that was all I wanted. BUYER BEWARE. Item description on AMAZON. NOT RIGHT. Picture is all you get."
5,Honest service from Tech for Less!,"Expedient delivery.With the arrival of product, it wasn't in condition described(probably a fluke) but Tech-for-Less ameliorated the problem.I will keep them in mind in the future."
5,this is my second one,I had one for several years with no leaks could not find a new seal the old one broke now i know what to look for and have an extra one to use now too
3,"Great, but not perfect","I purchased two of these mugs, so I would always have a clean mug for my coffee. I like the fact that you just pick up the mug not worrying where the sip spout is, and enjoy your beverage.I am not too happy with the fact that water, when it's washed, can get trapped behind the rubber grip on the mug. This happens every time you put it in the dishwasher. This is bad because when you grip the mug, water squirts out the bottom and gets all over the place. It is also not very spill proof. With the lid closed, if it gets knocked over, some of the liquid does dribble out.All in all, it keeps your hot beverages hot, and the cold ones cold. I would recommend with those reservations."
2,Go with another option...,"I purchased this and returned it for two reasons. The main reason is the 360 degree lid--while cool in concept--does not allow much liquid at all through. So, you have to tilt your head WAY back to get anything out of it (and off of the road in front of you if you happen to want to use this as an in-the-car mug). The very deep lip on this adds to the problem. This issue for me was an instant deal-breaker because I was buying this item for in the car use.Also, I found the mechanism to open and close the lid is really clunky. There is some room for error (the mug will leak if you haven't muscled the lid into position perfectly).I'd recommend the OXO Good Grips Click & Seal Travel Mug which beats this item like a drum for the same money and has a vacuum seal besides."
5,Best on the market,"This 2610 tumbler keeps coffee hotter longer. 360 lid is a must.Being a Rural Mail Carrier for 25 years, I've tried them all."
1,Top-heavy waste of money.,"Thermos seems completely unable to build a mug that won't completely tip over at the slightest nudge, and their caps seem to be built to make everything difficult.This thing is the second time I have bought one of their products and regretted it."
2,Item NOT as depicted,The MT-1 that I received is not the two toned MT-1 shown in the picture. It is more like a PLS target. I am very disappointed.
1,Beware!,I purchased this cover and the frame separately. The cover was shipped immediately but my order for the frame was canceled by the seller - apparently it is no longer available due to recalls related to structural integrity. So now I am returning the cover because I cannot acquire the frame any longer! Just wanted to let anyone else know about this before purchasing!
4,Great knives!....but the scissors are below par,"I have had the knives about a month now and I love them. They are quite heavy and sharp.My only real complaints are that most of these knives will not fit into a standard wooden knife block. You pretty much have to buy their special block to use with these knives. Secondly, the scissors they give you with the set are cheap and not very sharp. It's kind of like they are just throwing in the scissors as an afterthought."
2,Quickly begins to fail,"I've had my Miracle Blades for about 8 years now.. to begin with they were awesome, performing extremely well and with little issues. However, within 1 year or so, they began falling apart, with little bits and pieces of the plastic handles falling of. I also found that after less than 3 years they weren't able to cut as cleanly as before.For the price they are pretty good, I have however upgraded to a higher quality set of knifes for the kitchen, and now only use my Miracle Blades in the garage and garden."
2,It rusts,Even though it says it's stainless steel after using it for a few weeks ive noticed rust marks on the knives.
5,Sharp!!!,"These are fantastic, now I only have compared them to some cheapy Walmart ones but I havent come across anything that these knives dont cut through like a dream!I havent tried the pineapple in the air thing yet though hmm..."
3,Very sharp even at the non-blade end.,"I got two sets of this. I phone-ordered this and was talking with machine the whole way. So the order was not user friendly. Ordering via website might be better just so that correction can be made easily when you change your mind of something. Quality? It's not too bad for the price. However, the blade is not as strong as advertised. The sharp edge of the roller knife is bent already when cutting chicken back/thigh/leg bone. The other bad part about this is the top side of knife (non-blade part) is also very sharp. I got cut a few times by those edges. They should have smooth off the edges first before puting the knife to market."
1,Customer service stinks,"Since I gave this item as a gift, I am only rating the lack of customer service from the seller and from Amazon. Sleeves were missing from the box, and complaints to both the seller and Amazon received NO replies, whatsoever. On that basis I would like to be able to rate them lower than one star, but I can't. As far as the knives go, I can't say, because I have not personally used them."
4,very sharp,These knives are of average quality body wise but the blades are fantastic and the price is wonderful. They also make a great gift
4,Sharp,Who doesn't love a set of sharp knives for the holidays. I will be using one of these to carve meat on Christmas.
4,A few good knives & a few dull knives,"This Miracle Blade is a good set of knives; but, they are not my favorites. I purchased my knives at least six years ago. My favorite & most used items in this set are the shears, santoku-style Rock & Chop followed by the Filet. Love the shears for cutting up chicken, snipping herbs, etc. The Rock-n-Chop works well for cutting vegetables, fruit. The serrated bread knives are still in good shape; but, I don't use them often. The cleaver-shaped Chop & Scoop & paring knives were became dull within months of my purchase & I didn't use them much at all. The steak knives' blades became discolored & one rusted on the tip. So glad I didn't throw them away since some of the reviews here reminded me of Miracle Blade's lifetime warranty.."
3,not bad for $20,"The knives work pretty well, but after a week of use a couple had rusted, and the scissors broke after a few months."
5,knives,i am very pleased with these knives. the long sereated knife is great for slicing tomatoes. it cuts throught them with no problem. the weight of the knife does the cutting all you have to do is pull and push the knife and it cuts throught the tomatoe. all of these knives have served me well. thanks for the knives.
4,Sharp but rusty!,"These are sharp, strong knives! They slide through tomatoes without crushing the fruit. My concern is that when run through the dishwasher, they get rust spots on the metal blades. (Stainless steel shouldn't do that!) I've taken to hand washing them and that seems to work to keep them silver-colored."
4,As good as the add says,"We love this knife set. We have had the fancy, expensive knife sets and even though we try to keep them sharp, they always seem to need more sharpening. Not so with these knives. They are always sharp and cut everything easily!"
4,Sharp Cutter,"We've all at one point seen different items all on those as seen on T.V. infomercials. Sadly, there are most products that don't deliver as much as they had all claimed to be. For the Miracle Blade Company, an all those knives they hand out, they absolutely deliver in staying sharp, and and cut as sharp on anything. The slicer, which is mostly used for carving roasts, ham and turkey and cutting up bread, really thrives and delivers on the promise of simple and easy cutting. The other knives and cutlery, are simple to use, and are easy for cooking and everyday uses. I love using these because they really are worth the money. If you a knife set that absolutely works, I really recommend the Miracle Blade III.Price: B+Convience: A-Quality: B+Overall: B+"
5,I Have Used For Years And They Are Great,I have used these knives for maybe 10 years and only have good things to say. We treat them with little or no care and they still are the knives I reach for every time I open the knife drawer. We have bought sets for relatives and our children. I honestly can't find fault and a great value.
4,Miracle Blades,"Every time I go to Costco, I see expensive knives that I know I will buy someday when I get through the list of other ""nice to haves"" and ""must haves"". I bought a set of $39.00 knives at Costco. They looked nice but the blade started breaking. I decided to buy the Miracle Blades to hold us over until I get the expensive knives.The first thing anyone will notice about these knives is that the blades seem thin. None, the less, they all cut very well. The knives are comfortable to hold and make very good cuts. The steak knives surprised me because they are very good.The downside is that the knives have to hand washed. The price was right and the knives feel very good in the hand and do a very good job of cutting. At the price, they are a very good purchase."
5,Miricale blade knife set,"A++++++++++++++++++ the knives work flawless ! There as sharp as razor blades and make work I the kitchen a breeze ! The price was great ,I would definitely recomend these knives to others you won't be sorry ! Again A+++++++++++"
4,Slicers are truly great,I bought this knife set this summer. I use them exclusively and they work well. They all have their strengths and weakness. The slicers are truly great. they pretty much cut anything...
3,doesn't stay sharp long,I have only had these knives for less than a month and they are already having problems staying sharp. They blade got dull very fast with little use.
5,EXCELENT BOOK,"HAY THERE DO NOT LET THE TITLE OF THIS BOOK FOOL YOU. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR INFORMATOIN ABOUT ANABOLIC STERIODS, THIS IS NOT THE BOOK FOR YOU, THOUGH IS DOES HAVE A VERY SMALL SECTION ON THEM. IF YOU ARE ON THE OTHER HAND, LOKING FOR NATURAL WAYS OF BUILDING MUSCLE, OR WANT TO KNOW HOW TO EAT PROPERLY, OR EVEN WANT TO LEARN BASIC AND BY BASIC I DO NOT MEAN HARDCORE, THEN BUY THIS BOOK. IT IS NOT THE BEST ON THE SUBJET BUT IT IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN."
1,useless garbage,This is a great book if you want to trash your body with steroids and end up looking like a deformed monster like the author and the photo's of all the other moron's in this book. There is no honor or sense of personal accomplishment to use beef cattle drugs to attain big muscles.
4,This baseball game is a must have classic,"This game is great to dive into if you like old-school video games. It's not annoying like the new games (such as MLB 2K7) when it comes to just figuring out how to bat, pitch and catch.This is a very intuitive game, The menus are great, and it is very fast paced. you don't have to move your bat up and down and decide where you want to place it before you swing. You simply just swing the bat, It is all in the timing!, This game provides very good replay value. It is definitely one you want to place in your Sega Saturn collection."
2,Naughty Monkey Women's In the Bomb Flat,"Tan color looks very synthetic, cheapens look of shoe. Also very wide fitting."
4,Nice addition to the vehicle,"I purchased this for my husband as a surprise, there was some assembly required but not real bad. Once we have some wear on it I will follow up."
4,Surco Roof Rack for 1995 Jeep Cherokee,This was a great price for the Surco Roof Rack for my 1995 Jeep Cherokee. I would recommendextra brackets. I had four that held a spare tire and high lift jack. One of the brackets splitwhile off roading mildly on a vacation. It was very noisy and rattled a lot. More secure now thatI have a total of 8 brackets. Other than that nice looking and good price.
4,"So powerful, I was depressed the whole time I read it!","After finishing this book, a big heavy weight seemed to lift off my shoulders. This is a tribute to the prose -- which was vivid, convincing, and honest. But the content was so pathetic! Neither Taylor nor his wife seemed to feel any joy, share any humor. It made me realize how much I value the laughter that's a part of my own marriage. It made me realize there's nothing wrong with ""lightening up!"" I think one of the therapists that Taylor describes summed it up best when he told the couple they had less ""energy"" than any other couple he'd ever treated. I've never read an account of people more bogged down and burdened by the precious gift of life."
5,A beautifully written and moving story of a falling marriage,"Taylor's book tells us a lot about his marriage but even more about himself. It is an impressively honest self-portrait, a compelling story of one family and a thoughtful essay on separation and divorce. It is a must read for anyone who has ever left a marriage or thought about doing so, which is almost everyone."
5,Epitath of modern marriage,Taylor exhibits a fascinting account of his 13 year marriage. Fabulously written!
3,is this book for marriage or serial monogomy?,After finding that my boyfriend's mother had given him this book to read after he had a talk with her about marriage! I would just like to know how other readers would feel about this? I took it quite badly!
5,The Works Of a Prophet,"I had chosen Bob Marley for a paper I was doing at college. Many of the books that I read gave a little insight into the man and his reality but the most important thing about him, i.e. the music, many times is overlooked in the stories of many. To understand the man's music, what he wrote and what it means, to me, is what we are left with. This book not only allows you to understand his headspace but explains all the little things we may not really understand at first glance...Thankyou for giving me that insight..."
2,"NOT A BOOK OF LYRICS ""with commentary"" - just comments","Be forewarned: This book does NOT contain the LYRICS to Bob Marley songs. Okay, it doesn't SAY that it does, but you'd think a book about Bob Marley songs would include the songs themselves -- which is the reason I (regretably) bought this book. Astoundingly, it does not have the lyrics to ANY Bob Marley song. The commentary seems gossipy (as another reviewer put it), not historic and there is no sense, in fact, that any of the information in this book couldn't have been picked up by the author just by reading magazines. I am amazed that none of the other reviews here emphasize this fact."
2,Bad Reader 'Blood',"In the rush to reggae judgment, the Jones Beach reader is in error. The Wailers did reach Europe on the ""Survival"" tour, whose 1st leg embraced the Caribbean and the U.S. after the ""Survival"" album's '79 release, with the lengthy 2nd leg including Zimbabwe, Ireland, West Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark. Belgium (where ""Chant Down Babylon"" was written), the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, and England, winding up just as ""Uprising"" was released. So Sheridan is right. However, it was not Carlton Barrett of the Wailers who was called ""Family Man,"" as this book sez, but his brother Aston. Who the Cap fit."
2,Really didn't like.,Found I really needed a weekly calendar along with the monthly un-marked calendar in this book. Did like the pockets to keep loose papers and the seperate tabs for different activities in the household.
5,Lovely Drink!,"Since we don't drink wine or beer, I had a tough time finding glassware that would be attractive enough for entertaining, even when it held soda. The Marquis Vintage shape is positively beautiful, curving out at the top (no banging your nose!) and you feel decadent drinking from the thin (but not fragile-thin) glass. Lovely hi-ball & double-old-fashioned glasses that don't need a stem to look fancy."
1,piece of crap,The biggest pieces of crap. Do not buy. They have been open for one hour and lily's head fell off. And frandpas foot broke off. The worst 70 dollars I ever spent. They should be ashamed of themselves. My son is histerical on Christmas morning. Thanks asswipes.
3,Low quality of the materials,"The quality ogf the materials is very low. My son played with the figures, but they brake it in a couple of minutes"
5,enduring tool,"Shades of Gray is a practical guide for women at any of the many crossroads they encounter in their professional and family lives. The combination of real-life stories, journal suggestions with space to write, and resource recommendations makes it a useful tool for moms who have to continually reinvent their approach to work lives and commitments. This tool truly guides women through a process of prioritizing so they can make the best work/family choice for themselves and for their families. Concise enough for busy moms, this is great encouragement for the journey!"
4,Movies,"I found this a very entertaining movie, the fight sequences were OK, however I found the ending a bit weak and left me wondering what happened."
1,13 year olds will like it....,"Well.....uh....what to say: cheaply shot on digital and shows it, and unless lesbian scenes are something you really like (and miminalistic at that), I think I'd stay away. Good film for the just into puberty crown with hormones that react to anything, but as a zombie film for anyone past age 17-18 I don't think you'll watch it again, or want to. Even the lazer hidden up the heroine's wazzoo that she fries the bad guy with at the end was NOT an issue of saving grace for the film. DO NOT BE IMPRESSED (see, that did not work, did it?) with all-caps exclamations of how great this film is. Methinks they dost protest too much in advance.And by the way....the ""wazzoo"" scene is pretty lame LOL"
3,"Certainly not great literature, but my daughter likes it a lot!","I picked up this book as part of a package of board books at a thrift store. My daughter noticed it right away and had to have it read over and over. It's a shape book, shaped like Katy Kitten, and has a super simple and short tale of Katy wandering away from her mother, playing with a bunny, and getting found again due to her bell. The pictures are not clear, as often Katy looks bigger than her mother, and of course the plot is not really compelling, but there must be something about this that has kid appeal, as it's been on our heavy reading rotation list!"
3,decent sound quality compared to most,"Only thing that I had tried that was better than this is the Ultimate Ears equivalent level sets. This loses out to UE on the bass as well as the clarity of the sound. However, this wins over VModa, Sony, Bose and even Etymotic(if you want bass).I do hate the black medium size rubber cover, though. They are not made smoothly and hurt my ears very much, especially during a long flight."
1,Can't find a fit!,"I bought these on a limb. I hadn't read any reviews, hadn't seen them in action -- not that it would have helped. Everyone rates these 5 stars, especially here on Amazon... but I couldn't find ones that fit!I tried every piece. I tried pulling my ear, using 2 different pieces on each ear, and nothing would ever work. They'd always fall out on the slightest movement or anything.Sitting here right now after trying to figure out a way to make them fit for 45 minutes leaves me extremely frustrated and wishing I could return them. Nope. Guess not. Hundred bucks down the drain.Grrr!"
3,Abby and the Best Kid Ever,"In this book Abby starts babysitting for Lou McNally (formally known as the worst kid ever). Abby expects to have to sit a big time troublemaker, but instead Lou acts like little miss perfect. Lou seems to be very careful not to make any trouble, and gets very upset whenever something involving her goes wrong or gets messed up. Abby discovers Lou's secret in Abby and the Best Kid Ever."
5,IPPY Award Winner and a real treasure,This is an amazing collection of photos and a heartfelt plea to preserve tigers in the wild. Our Independent Publisher Book Awards judges were dazzled by the photography and the creativity of the presentation. It's the kind of awareness-raising nature book we need more of to help save the planet's endangered wild animals.
2,Too confusing and too old for computer,This product did not want to even run in my computer and it appears that is not what I'd hoped for in my need for help in translating French research... All in all I'd say it was a waste of money.
2,Inadequate treatment of the subject matter,"I was quite disappointed with this book. As other reviewers have commented it is really just a book about the author's experience of aura viewing and not much info on anything else. Instructions for the reader to actually see auras are limited to a one-page appendix. Auras are such a vast and interesting subject and this book doesn't do that justice. It's really just a basic introduction for people who are only mildly interested in learning about auras. If you're really hungry to learn may I suggest something like ""Hands of Light"" by Barbara Brennan which goes really in-depth into the subject. And as someone who has bought quite a few ""aura books"", I'd also recommend that you buy one that contains excercises which will actually prime your vision for aura viewing. EVERYONE is capable of seeing auras so get practising and enjoy the journey!"
2,not to good,"This book looked very intreguing. But the old lesson, ""if it's to looks to good to be true it probably is"" held true once again. Yes you can see auras in only 60 seconds; however, with the way the author drags on with boring storys about him self it'll take you hours to get to the information which in this book is not very accurate or well presented; however, since it did have ""SOME"" information on auras that would be a little helpful(to some one who knew nothing that is) I didn't give it the worst review, although there are MUCH MUCH better books out there!"
1,Never 60 Seconds,"I can't describe how disappointed I am with this book. Most part of the book tells you about things you don't need to know. I find it a bit boring. The explaination of how to view Auras is on the last page, and the instructions is just 1 page. There is no way beginners will be able to see Auras in 60 seconds, unless ofcourse one is gifted (which is rare). What most books don't tell you is that you should train your physical peripheral vision. We all are accustomed to viewing certain things certain way, and this creates a type of block to relax and defocus the eyes. If one really practices this, within 1 week viewing Auras will not be a problem."
2,Disappointed,"Only about 5 of the 139 pages had worthwhile information. The rest is ""filler"" about the author's encounters with famous people and their auras. While semi-interesting, I bought the book for information on how to see auras and what they mean. The color chart in the appendix only covers that in a most cursory way."
1,only the first eight pages have some value,"Only the first eight pages have some value for someone who is interested in auras and spirituality. This is not really a book about aura's, it is an extended gossip column about famous people the author met. As if auther and publisher thought ""how can we find enough content to make these eight pages into a book"". For me it was a waste of money and time."
1,save yourself the trouble,"The book seems rather pointless except to take the reader down the author's memory lane. Does he offer exercises to see auras? Yes, in fewer than ten pages in the index. So why does the rest of the book exist? Not to offer any uses for aura reading. Not to provide advanced exercises for honing your new-found skills. I actually have no idea why anyone would read this book when the entire thing can be summarized in one sentence: unfocus your eyes, breathe deeply, just hope that everyone you see walks only in front of white unpatterned walls, and there you go...Buy a book that has a point."
4,Seeing Auras,"This is such a simple book to read, I read it in less than a day, but it packs a lot of information in it. I started to see auras the same day I read it. Simple, clear and to the point. - Loved it."
3,I still can't see anything.,"This book is adequate, but I still can't see anything by reading this book."
5,"Sorry A.Randi, give Smith the 1 mil. YOU LOOSE!",I love these so called skeptics. Smith's book proves the paranormal is REAL
2,Are these really American made or Chinese?,After reading one of the critical reviews I balked at purchasing these boots. are they really US made or from China??
1,Much ado about nothing,"80% of the book is focused on a very simple module and some variations, that allows you to do... cubes. And then entire chapters dedicated to how to link them and also detailing how to build a big house, a small house, a church, etc. etc. etc. The same stuff could be done easily in 10% of the book. If someone is interested in this kind of origami, then better buy ""Unit Origami"" from Tomoko Fuse.The rose section is Ok, well explained and detailed (10% of the book)The math section is hard, not well introduced and not very clear.Summary-> get the Kawasaki rose (very nice, by the way) from any other book. You will get the same profit, and you will save money."
3,Would be nicer if it was in English.,"The author is very detailed. One gets the feeling that they are working with a true teacher to create the shapes and understand the math. But the English is terrible. More attention should have been paid getting a competent translator. After reading through some of the book I feel like I've lost my own ability to speak English, and English is my native language."
4,Great relax,"A beautiful book, great schemas ... I could rate it 5 stars if only there were few photos more."
5,Greatest Sawhorse Ever,"I am a union carpenter (27 years) and these are the best sawhorses I have ever owned. They might be a little heavy but well worth the excellent strength. Rock solid, and positive locking on the legs. I will never have to buy another set cause these will last forever. Had these for a year , with heavy use and still perform as if new."
5,These are some of the best collapsable saw horse that you could ever buy!,"The stable mate saw horse are sturdy, strong, and they don't wiggle at all when in use. I've had problems with other metal saw horses where the legs would begin to close while you were moving material around on them. In the end, that play caused those horses to fail. This is not a problem with the stable mates. The legs lock open and lock closed. Make note that these horse are on the heavy side. The only addition that would make them better is a handle to carry them with."
4,A fun but average game,This game is fun but it suffers from being way too average. Its basically Street Fighter with swords. It is also pretty short on characters. I believe there are a total of eight. If your a fan of the Golden Axe series you well most likely enjoy this game but if your looking for something innovative you should probably look elsewhere. I had a lot of fun with this game though.
1,Bad Software/Poorly Designed Hardware,"I read the other review on this site before purchasing this product and thought that possibly he was exaggerating and it would be of help to us in our weekly poker game. I was wrong this is a terribly designed product for any halfway serious poker player. The software is very bad and does not allow you to vary the bet size in no limit. The Big blind cannot raise when the bet comes back to him on the deal. When you are all in it deals all five cards at once, losing all suspense. There only two buttons on your remotes select and ok which force you to cycle through the options and you have to hit ok to see your cards when it is not your turn so sometimes you will inadvertently place a bid instead of seeing your cards. A very poorly designed product."
4,Great True Adventure/History,"Clive Cussler's adventures that he relates in ""The Sea Hunters"" are as fascinating as any of the fictional adventures in his novels - at least when one factors in that the ""Sea Hunters"" adventures are true. After vignettes that speculate on the likely final moments of a ship or other item of historical interest, Cussler describes the efforts of NUMA to locate these artifacts. These efforts are alternately dangerous, frustrating, and humorous, and Cussler's descriptions of them are consistently entertaining. ""The Sea Hunters"" provides a great adventure read, and also serves as a reminder of some forgotten or underappreciated historical episodes."
4,"This was a very good book,Cussler is one of a kind.",Cussler takes first place when it comes to war. His war scenes are great but it got boring during the historical parts.The action scenes are very realistic.
3,Light reading for history buffs,"In his spare time Clive Cussler, the renowned author of adventure stories starring Dirk Pitt, hunts for historic ships that went down at sea or on rivers, by the hand of nature or man. In this first book he describes the explorations of the volunteers of NUMA to trace those ships. The ships are mainly 19th and 20th century warships. In about ten short stories he first very vividly describes what may have happened on board of the boats based on historical facts combined with fantasy and then the tedium and excitement of searching for and finding the ships (plus one train engine).Clive Cussler has a very funny style of writing which makes this book light reading, even though content-wise it is mainly for the really historically interested."
5,ONE OF THE MOST INTERESING BOOKS ABOUT WRECK FINDING,Ilives in a small village to the sea in the South West part of Holland 200 meters from the sea. In our area there are laying 500 shipwreck and with my own small boat i have located lots wrecks and with Lowrance X-16 echosounder and Decca navigator.i found them It is a very time consuming job to find the wrecks but a am very happy when i have a nice trace from my papersounder. When i start to read the hole book in one time. It is for me one of the most interesting books about wreckfinding because you must be very patience . Nearly for my door there is an old VOC ship the Woestduin but nobody have found it but roughly i know the position of this wreck. I am not a diver but sportfisherman . My profession is butcher
4,Don't Go Changing,"At the age of 33, I was beginning to frown on my Cussler addiction as prolongued immaturity (I've read all of his books at least 2+ times). Thank you Clive for setting me straight! The introduction alone reminded me that wide eyed boyhood wonder shouldn't be supressed. As for the rest of the book it does an excellent job of balancing the sense of adventure and fantasy embodied in a shipwreck with cold hard unglamorous reality. If anything this book only convinced me what a unique talent Cussler is at being able to create a mystery and let us revel in the shear joy of it's unravelling"
4,The Real Dirk Pitt,"Great Book. I'm not one for non-fiction, but this is an exception. It has exciting historical-fiction stories about actual sunken ships and a non-fiction account of how the author, Clive Cusser (Dirk Pitt) and his band of actual NUMA sub-mariners were able to search for, and find these historical relics. A must read!"
3,Dirk Pitt's real adventures?,"Cussler (along with Craig Dirgo) recounts the real-life searches for a number of famous shipwrecks (and a lost locomotive) in this non-fiction book. You'll see the inspiration for a lot of the fictional Dirk Pitt's adventures in Cussler's narratives.While the book is enjoyable, some of the searches are given a shorter shrift, and others are longer, leaving you wanting more. Also, each section is preceded by a ""dramatic"" rendering of how a ship was lost, and some of these sections are a bit flat. Actually, I wanted more detail on Cussler's searches and his adventures with his NUMA buddies.Still, if you like Cussler's Pitt adventures, and love sea stories, you'll want to at least give this a look."
3,"Not as exciting as Dirk Pitt's adventures, but interesting.","The book certainly doesn't move at the pace of a Dirk Pitt novel, so as a Cussler fan, I was somewhat disappointed. But Cussler's humorous antecdotes of his real life NUMA exploits gave me an interesting perspective on the man behind the fictional hero. His interpretations of the events leading up to the actual disasters were informative and enlightening"
4,Fairly decent book. Shows other side of Cussler,"As a fan of the Dirk pitt novels, I felt that TheSea Hunters showed another style to CliveCussler. Though it was not as exciting as hispast novels ,this was a good attempt byCussler to show us another side to his writing.You cannot really compare it to Cussler's otherbooks as it is non-fiction and it is his first attemtat such a work(at least publicly). It was fairlyentertaing and a quick read for this fan"
2,Not for Dirk Pitt lovers,"To be honest, I was mighty dissappointed with this work. While some of the Civil War history bits were interesting, the book really drags on. While I am a huge fan of Clive's Dirk Pitt series, he let me down here. It seemed as if he just needed to blow his own horn, or inflate his ego, and did it at the reader's expense. Sorry Clive...stick to what you do best"
3,Don't assume you'll like this because you like his fiction,"I bought and read this book because I've -- literally -- bought and ready every other Cussler book.Frankly, I found this one a bit of a bore. Not bad... but not why I read Cussler.I'm going to stick with Cussler's fiction."
2,Read the review,"Mr. Cussler writes well enough and is very likeable, however, the book is mostly ""dramatized history"" and I abhor that genre. Mr. Cussler warns the reader of his embellishments in advance and I'm sure he uses it to make the stories more interesting, but it is not for me. Also one ship after another kept sinking and after awhile it got monotonous. I wish Cussler well in his endeavors and I sure appreciated his honesty but I prefer my history ""straight""."
1,BORING,If I knew then what I know now. I would not have wasted mymoney on this book.I thought this was another Dirk Pitt novel. BOY WASI WRONG!!!
2,I thought that this book wasn't explicit enough.,As I said in line one I thought this book wasn't explicit enough to suit my needs about the famous shipwrecks that occured hundreds even thousands of years ago. The shipwreck that I was looking for in this book wasn't here and it didn't satisfiy my needs for a massive college report that was due approximately a monoth ago. I failed that class due to your lack of information on the subject that I needed information for. Thanks for NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Great game,"I prefer OLG1 because its a little easier to play. But this, OLG2 is great, so much more golf (courses, holes) to play. Being a guy, the girls are much sexier with different outfits to unlock. I like the new skill events, blowing up cows, driving carts around running people over, etc."
2,Not for Oldbies,"I am old. I am an old person. I am old person with an Xbox and a Kinect.I am old. I am an old person. I am an old person who enjoys golf, hates bad weather, and despises TIger Woods' horrific golf game.I am old, and I do not enjoy this game at all.The moral of this terrible haiku is: Old people probably won't enjoy this game. Even old people who have an Xbox and a Kinect."
3,Definitley Not like 1,"Well this isnt like the First outlaw golf...There are good points to it..the new characters,outfits,and even a few of the new courses..Although some of the courses are really bad and difficult.The worst part of Outlaw golf 2 overall has to be the announcer or commetar...what is up with that idiot...No where near funny like the first one and the lines are so over done many times.it is some what fun if you take the talking out and get use to the courses..rent it first if you can then decide to buy it..I was disappointed"
5,Skrewdriver after the fire,"I may be bias because this was my first Skrewdriver 12"" vinyl ever 25 years ago but it still sounds great!!!"
3,A disappointing comeback,"LFO's ""Advance"" was one of the classic mid-nineties dance albums, with its crisp, almost militaristic beats and moonrise-on-Mars atmosphere. This album, seven years later, is a bit of a letdown, with much less of a distinctive identity. It reminded me more of Orbital at their most techno than of previous LFO releases... but much, much less interesting than Orbital. Oh well."
5,Charming and fun,"It's as much fun visiting Laura Fleming's hometown and meeting her relatives as it is trying to solve the mystery. That is what makes Ms. Kelner's mysteries so enjoyable. Her depiction of a North Carolina town is dead on, and this novel delves into the subculture of flea markets. While the novel is well written and well plotted (like Ms. Kelner's other work), it's the interesting characters that make this book a good read."
3,"some errors, but a pretty good book altogether","This is not a perfect book, but better then some others.I recommend this book for someone wanting to understand Security as well as study for the Sec+ exam.you may want to back this book up with testking or something like that before you try the exam, but this book is a good reference for future use as well."
4,Timing is everything these days.,"One thing about certifications and study guide I have seen over the years is he who gets there first is the book that most people choose. While this is the generally accepted rule, rules do have exceptions.Having worked on and currently working on Security+ material, this book is objective complete. Greg White, the author, has an excellent grasp of the material. He uses excellent examples and note to illustrate his points.For he most part the book is detailed, I was especially impressed with the Cryptography section and the algorithm breakdown. I have never seen this in any book before.There are certainly a good number of practice questions both in the book and on the cd-rom, and they appear to have the exam covered. Overall the book is a good source of information; timing is the big issue here."
2,Not Adequate!,"I took the Security+ exam and passed the first time.For a study guide, I used the All in One for Security+. The guide is inadequate in that in completely omits some popular test subjects while going into too much detail on other items. If I depended on this one source solely, I probably would not have passed. Thank God I had the Sybex CISSP book to help me through!In retrospect, I can understand the recommendation to use many sources because you might be missing important test topics if you don't. When taking the exam, the questions I had trouble with were ones that were nowhere to be found in any of the study materials I used. Even if I had memorized the entire ""All in One"" book, or had it in my lap when taking the exam, it would not have helped me on some of the questions.In sum, if you depend on the ""All in One"" for Security+, it is likely you will have a hard time passing even if you memorize the book cover to cover. My advice - use another source or many other sources.Good Luck!"
5,Love Judge Judy,You can't go wrong when it's Judge Judy. These were a gift for my mom and she said this and the other JJ book were great.
3,good but not great,"I love Judge Judy and have watched her show for many years. The advice in her no-nonsense book is great for people who, like her, had a great childhood, great parents, high self esteem, great education, great sense of humor, and great work experience. However her advice is much less realistic for women from abusive childhoods, who have low self esteem, no brilliant sense of humor to fall back on, or who have no real work experience or prospects, particularly if they are older. In an ideal world all women could follow her advice and flourish, but reality is much harsher and produces the broken souls who struggle through life barely making it. She also essentially condemns full-time stay at home moms, saying all women must have a career as ""divorce insurance."" While this advice is practical it is, again, not realistic for many women."
5,Judge Judy the Queen of Common Sense!,"I'm a BIG Judge Judy fan! I have read all her books. Her great sense of humor, common sense, and judicial savvy are always a thought-provoking good read especially in ""Beauty Fades, Dumb is Forever.""This book was primarily written for women to keep them from doing stupid things. I found the book extremely enjoyable. It will open the eyes and mind of any woman. And it will allow them to be a victor and not a victim in life, in love, and in society.I was so impressed with this book that I bought two copies for my youngest two daughters. I thought that this book would help them down their future roads.I highly recommend this insightful book to all."
5,"Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever",Judge Judy Sheindlin writes another excellent book in which she tells it like it is. This book is primarily for women who are seeking ways to empower themselves.
4,Good reinforcement!,"I listened to Judge Judy's book on audio cassette while walking. I picked it up because my spirits were low and I needed a boost. I don't think this book will change your life but it's entertaining and it helps reinforce some good points that we, as women, need to be reminded of. She helps you accept the inequalities in the work place and gives you tips on how to make the best of it."
1,Could not finish this book,"One of my children gave me this book because I love Judge Judy. However, the book was written for teenage girls and young women. I am a 60 plus year-old male. I don't give up on books. If I start it, I finish it, no matter how long it takes. However, as much as I tried, I could not read this book to the end. If I could give less than one star, I would."
2,Compellingly embarrassing in its biting bitchy prose,"For those of you who watch Judge Judy, this book will come as no surprise. It portrays a self-absorbed, mean spirited, insulting harridan who explains her behavior by citing the positive virtues of self-confidence and self-esteem. I suspect that Judge Judy gets away with her spoiled brat behavior because she frightens the majority of people who have been taught to be civil and courteous.There are an important underlying message in this book,namely, the need to be an independent, strong human being. However, Judge Judy is not the role model that I want my daughters to emulate."
1,I did not even slightly enjoy this book.,"This book falls into the category of books that is very dry and boring. I classify it under the Susan Powers and Thinner Thighs in Thirty Days section. It is not interesting and poorly written. I recommend avoiding this book, because it is a waste of money."
3,A good lesson for everyone,"I'm not usually a fan of Ms Sheindlin but when she's talking about a topic she's not going to make the subject fluffy. It'll be blunt and straight to the point. This is what will get with this book.Be pretty sure, don't do dumb things. Don't be dumb."
5,A Book For Everyone!,"I finally found a book with which I can identify! Judge Judy is a no-nonsense woman, no games here. She has the ability to ""read"" people quickly and they don't pull anything over on her. She is intelligent, witty, with a rare talent these days, COMMON SENSE!I loved the book and am recommending it to everyone. Her sensible, confident approach to life is refreshing and makes for healthier relationships. She shares her passion, pain and struggle.I loved the story in the ""Lawyers Lounge,"" an example of guts and class! This book is easy reading and not convoluted. No Pop-Psychology here, just straight to-the-point and witty! It isn't about putting men down either. It's about INDEPENDENCE - financial and emotional.I recommend ALL women read this book and make life a little easier for those of us who are still fighting for ""equality"" in the workplace!"
4,This one goes on my gift list for family & frineds!,"My husband and I enjoy meeting at lunchtime and watching Judge Judy together so we were naturally curious about her book when we saw her on Larry King Live this week. Bought the book and loved it! We've been married 28 years and laughed together over toilet paper and toilet lids! Been there done that! But mostly we talked about how great this book would be for the young single mothers in our family as well as those who are growing in their marriages, child-rearing, and dealing with life in the REAL world. Some illustrations (only one really) was a little graphic, but we love Judge Judy's honesty and tell-it-like-it-really-is style. Thanks for a great read Judy. We'll be sure to pass it on!"
4,Great game,"One of the top Sega Saturn games for the system. One that should be in the collection, especially if you are a Street Fighter series fan. The only thing is, if you are very good at the game, then it is short. Best to play with two players."
3,Typical Osprey,This book is almost the only treatment of this battle available in English unless you want to buy an out of print war game on ebay or a set miniature rules. Like most Osprey books you will find a formula presentation with workman like but not inspired writing. Osprey battle studies are utilitarian at best and his one fits the mold. Illustrations as always are excellent.
3,Good amount of information but doesn't go into enough depth.,"The author covers every aspect of the battle but only glances over most information with a page or 2 when I would have really liked a lot more. There are only about 30 pages on the actual battle (many pictures take up a lot of space) I wish he had written twice that amount of information. The information given is excellent, but like I said I just wish there was more. It does read a bit like a high school text book which can take away the emotion from the reader."
4,The Grammar Activity Book,"This book is a wonderful resource for the ESL teacher. The cover says, ""...for young students"" but my class of adults has enjoyed the varied activities. All games are explained fully, including time needed for preparation and the amount of time needed to play. All the materials are photocopiable - what a time saver! It's the best book of its kind that I have found."
1,CruzerSynch Doesn't Work--No Support,"As a dumb hard drive this is 1GB for more money than you need to spend. The ""U3 CruzerSynch"" preloaded application has never been able to transfer the Contact list from my Outlook Express, it crashes...everytime. It's also better to use SyncToy from MS because CruzerSynch only synchs (deletes files deleted from the HD) while SyncToy has a ""Contribute"" option that never deletes from the destination drive. I contacted ""support"" I sent them the requested copy of my wab; they've been ""working"" on it for weeks, I never expect to hear from them. CruzerSynch also, without warning, deleted my address book (Contacts) from my HD. Not good."
4,good one,"Works really well, I am happy with its speed and compactness. Only feedback for future buyers, is you really don't need steel heavy weight body while the same application of storage media can be get done with 20 times low weight polymers unless you throw storage media bellow running vehicle or give it to children so they can accidentally chew it."
1,Do Not Buy this Item,"As mentioned in other reviews, this USB key *features* a near impossible to remove CD appearing partition that auto-installs U3 software to your windows machine.This partition also appears on Macs but does not do anything. Luckily.There is a removal tool, but it enters an infinite loop on my Dell.Vote with your feet and do not buy this hardware."
1,could not uninstall U3 and get this to work as a FAT drive,"I bought this to use for updating a database inside an airplane. The airplane equipment (avionics) requires that the USB drive be formatted ""FAT"". I downloaded the uninstall app from U3 and Windows said the archive was corrupted. I downloaded another app from SanDisk, but it didn't work either. If it were bigger, I could use it as a doorstop..."
5,Great introduction to Lubavitch ideology.,"Library Journal: A knowlegeable proponet of the Lubavitch movement, a Chasidic sect that embodies many of the mystical aspects of Judaism, Gurary has written an extensive interpretation of Judaism. He uses framework of Maimonides's famed 13 principles to attach basic Lubavitch concepts. He correctly distinguishes between normative Judaism and Chasidim and prefaces many statements with ""Chasidus explains..."" this distiction is particularly important when he addresses controversal areas such as the doctrine of reincarnation orthe concept of the differences between a Jewish and non-Jewish soul. Well sritten, highly recommended"
5,All things bright and beautiful...,"I've listened to 4 different recordings of Durufle's Requiem closely: Santa Cecilia National Academy Orchestra Rome with Cecilia Bartoli and Conducted by Myung-Whun Chung, Voices of Ascension Chorus & Orchestra with Patricia Spence and Conducted by Dennis Keene, Atlanta Symphony Orchestra & Chorus with Judith Blegen and Conducted by Robert Shaw, and this one. And I have to say that this is my favorite. The textures are richer and the performances by the orchestra and choir are better than the others. I will admit though that Cecilia Bartoli gets my vote for most beautiful performance of the Pie Jesu, but Anne Sofie von Otter's rendition is also very nice.However, if you're looking for just one recording of Durufle's Requiem, this should be the one."
2,Poor at best,"Whether it's choirs that don't know how to blend, an orchestra that doesn't know how to stay together, or any combination of choirs and instrumentalists that don't know how to play in tune, this gorgeous piece in its full orchestral version does not yet appear to have received the treatment it so desperately needs. Sadly, this recording is no exception. In fact, it is one of the worst offenders: French Horns that sound like they're playing in a closet, an orchestra that can't keep the tempo together, subtleties inherent in the music that are entirely missed. Someday someone is going to do justice to this beautiful piece, and give it the interpretation it deserves."
5,Beautiful and compelling music,"This is perhaps one of the world's most beautiful and compelling music. Durufle gives us the mist of heaven in these songs, his composition original and dynamic. The music flows like water yet intense and rich. If Christ were alive today, this music would follow him. Never overbearing but powerful and sincere, Durufle could not have imagined how wonderful his masterpiece would continue to impress. A must have for all musical buffs and classical fans alike."
3,Yogi Bear 3 Disc Combo,The movie was an okay movie. Nothing special. I bought it because it was 3D and I thought my grandchildren might enjoy it. I know they liked the movie but not overwhelmingly so. Still nice to have around to look at with the kids.
2,yogi,"the selection came on time and it was good quality. the only problem was, I did not enjoy the movie"
4,It bears watching,"A light, humorous Yogi Bear movie that is entertaining for the whole family, especially engineers due to all of the contraptions Yogi makes. Fun to watch in 3D."
2,Yogi Bear,It was really dull. Not at all creative or any of the wittiness I expected from Dan Aykroyd. Not recommended.
4,Fun. Awesome 3D. Incredible actually.,"Seriously, the 3D effects in this movie, along with the native 3D filming, are just incredible. And while it's only 20 bucks now, so worth it. It's Yogi. There's nothing really deep about the story. It is what it is. Of all of my 3D blu rays, I've watched this one probably the most."
4,Yogi Bear,"Originally saw movie in 3D, in Thailand. Daughter loved the movie. She wanted to be able to watch whenever she wanted."
1,Yuck!,"Couldn't even watch the whole movie, it's that BAD! Don't bother getting this movie, and please don't buy it, you will be sorry."
5,Something for the whole family,Some times its hard to find a movie the whole family likes! I really liked the fact it reminded me of the old yogi cartoons I grew up watching.
2,Yogi Sounds Like a Canadian Emigre,"Dan Akroyd has always sucked... always. He could never stand on his own: Blues Brothers there was Belushi, Ghostbusters there was Murray. He makes Yogi sound like a Canadian slav. What a POS. There is way too much dialogue in this film, and Ranger Smith is too busy trying too imitate Travolta's voice. I never heard a movie so awful!!!!!!"
2,Awful movie.,"I slept for 1/2 of the movie and so did my 2 daugthers, i gave it 2 stars based on the 3D, it was better than other movies i've seen, but the movie itself was boring."
1,Basic Math,"Add:(1.) Poor CG animation (at least by the standards of the past decade).(2.) Overlay poor CG animation on stock park tourist film.(3.) Stereotypic and unimaginative storyline of dumb park guys meeting cute female scientist.(4.) Stereotypic storyline of bad politicians, attempting to convert park into money, thwarted by dumb park guys and cute scientist.(5.) Also helped by bungling bears with weird voiceover.(6.) Sophomoric, simplistic cliché driven script.Equals:Forgettable negative one (-1)."
1,Horrible,"Horrible story line, worse acting and low quality puppet animation. Nothing of value in this one at all. 100% waste of time. Go watch the real classics instead. Time better spent."
1,False Advertising,"When I bought this movie it was advertised as a 3D Blue Ray/DVD combo. Well I got all of the kids together for family movie night, telling them we were going to watch Yogi in 3D and I opened the movie and.....NO 3D! Needless to say all were disappointed. I have ordered very often off of Amazon and I was surprised and disappointed this time."
3,Yogi Bear,"There were some good parts but mostly it was just ok. It wasn't a bad movie, it's just not one we would want to watch over and over."
3,Some of the language was inappropriate,"And, ever since my kids saw this movie, they sing The Sir Mix A Lot ""I like big butts"" song. Not something you want them singing...."
5,Yogi bear review,This a fun movie for the entire family to watch they should make movies like this but buy the bluray it's a better picture
3,The five year old boy liked it,"I watched it with him the first time but surfed the web the second time around. Tame kid humor, not much for adults but we rented it for the boy anyway."
3,"Not nearly as bad as expected. Adults can stand it, kids will love it. Aykroyd was perfect choice. I say B-, my kids say A.","An evil mayor wants to shut down Jellystone Park for his personal gain. Ranger Smith and Yogi come up with a plan to save the park. Going in I was expecting pretty much one of the lamest movies of the year. It wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. Although this is geared toward kids and is extremely predictable it does have enough funny parts in it to keep adults entertained (an 80 min run-time helps). Much like ""Garfield"" the voice of Yogi (Aykroyd) is a strange choice at first, but after hearing it you can't think of anyone else doing the voice. As much as I don't want to say it Timberlake, as the voice of Boo-Boo, is actually a really good choice too. Adults will be able to stand most of it, kids will love it. I say B-, my kids say A.Would I watch again? - I wouldn't, my kids did."
5,Awesome,Product arrived on time and in perfect condition. No flaws whatsoever. My kids love this movie and want to watch it all the time.
4,My granddaughters favorite!,"I bought this movie for my 2 year old granddaughter just as it was released on Blu-Ray and it came in the mail quicker than expected.She asks to watch Yogi Bear every time she comes over.I liked the fact that it was a 2 disc set, but thought it came with a regular dvd along with the Blu-Ray disc that I could send to my daughers house for the little one to watch at home too. I was a bit disappointed that you could only download the DVD to your computer, had to do it within a certain frame time, and then you didn't have the pportunity to continue using the disc. I felt the description was a little misleading."
3,Great for Kids......Solid 3 stars,"Unlike other movies, this one seemed to have been made for kids. It has all theingredients and characters and the script on a kid's level. As a adult, like somereviewers mentionned, you could easily predict what will happen on most scenes.But i still like it and enjoyed my childhood animated stars comming to lifewith CGI. Dan and Justin did pretty good work with the character voices..."
3,Yogi Bear The Movie is a one time hit.,"Yogi Bear the Movie is a good movie but not a great one.I would recommend people to see it,but only once.The jokes are kind of childesh and the story is ok.The Movie is about Yogi Bear and Boo Boo trying to steal pic-a-nic baskets and they always fail.Ranger Smith finds a love in an animal loving girl named Rachel.Rachel films a documentry about Jellystone park.The bad guy of the film is this guy whos running for mayor.He wants to close Jellystone shortly after its 100th anniversery.Jellystone is failing to make alot of money.Ranger Smith has a traine named Ranger Jones who dreams to soon be head Ranger like Smith is.Could Yogi,Boo Boo,Ranger Smith,and Rachel save Jellystone Park or will it close down forever?Theres altot of stuff that will make children laugh and some stuff that might make Adults,and Teens laugh too.I rate this movie 3/5."
3,"""Heyyyy Boo Boo! Is that me, that I see, with a pick-a-nic basket up in that tree?""","Why do I think that this movie is okay? Because it is lighthearted, inoffensive stuff. It really doesn't have a lot to draw on so it is pure slapstick of the doofy kind. Harmless stuff. Safe for kids. Bland for adults. Except if you're an Anna Faris fan. I kinda like her. She's ditzy bland here but I still like her. The voices of Dan Aykroyd as Yogi and Justin Timberlake as Boo Boo are unplaceable (you probably wouldn't know, and shouldn't know, unless you were told).The blu-ray has a lot of bonus features, many of which are informational for the younguns and there are several games if you're into that sort of thing on your DVDs. Get this cheap and the value just goes up and up."
4,Fantastic 3D transfer marred only by the movie itself,"Don't let the 1 Star review from SKAR scare you off from purchasing this movie. While the movie itself is nothing incredible, the 3D Blu Ray looks absolutely incredible. I watched it on a 50"" Panasonic Viera GT25 with my PS3 and this is one of the most eye-popping 3D movies I've had the pleasure of watching from the comfort of my couch. Those of you starved for more 3D Blu's shouldn't hesitate to pick this one up."
2,Horrible movie,"I didn't like this movie and regret for buying it. This movie sucks more than the useless and uber-expensive Tron 5 discs set. It's not funner, like Open Season and i ejected it right away in the second chapter, because i can't find the remote control of the player to do it sooner.(It's not even enjoable. btw!)So, save yourself a lot of frustations, your money and stay away from this movie. Seriously..."
4,Radio-friendly Power-Pop,"Pete has so many good things going, its hard to know where to start. First of all, the production values on this Citizen Frail are outstanding. Pete and Clarke are masters of sonic partitioning and dynamics. Nobody builds a song up and tears it back down again as well. No kidding, these guys are in a league somewhere between Butch Vig and Roy Thomas Baker. I'm not sure how to categorize these tunes, Pete has a post-alternative power-pop feel going. Easy on the ear with interesting instrument choices and arrangements. The use of the horns is tasteful and works beautifully. Pete has a breathy intimacy in his voice that is distinct and effective. Nice work guys. Don't keep us waiting so long for the next one..."

2,"Good graphics, gameplay not so good","I bought this because i saw a shot of it and the graphics looked realy good. However, the game itself is terrible. There are only about 10 different moves which ever wrestler has and you can do all the moves in one fight and then it gets boring. It is so easy to finish. Don't get it."
4,Classic Gem,"I received it on time, it was in good shape for a game that is over ten years old. It played right and I loved it."
1,Easier Controls would make for Better Games,"I was very dissapointed in Mayhem. The controls are very difficult to master, and the graphics weren't all that hot either. The create-a-character didn't really make up for it, as it has about 1/5 of the creation options of that of one of the WWF games. My personal oppinion is that Revenge is still the best WCW game for the 64 to date."
4,Great book!!!,"This was my first time reading Sandra Kitt's work. The book dealt with real issues (teenage pregnancy, abortion, drugs, and interracial marriage, and the problems this can cause for children such as Kent. Patricia related to Kent's problem of identity because she had experienced this herself. I was very pleased with the way Ms. Kitt concluded this one. Great love story too."
4,Thank goodness for a dose of reality!!,"This book was well written. But more importantly to me, this book seemed to deal with real issues. I felt like the problems and pressures that faced the main characters were issues real people deal with every day. Definately worth reading."
4,Very Sensual Reading,"I read this book twice this past weekend. It was really a good challenging, compassionate, sensual and romantic book. It dealt with real life situations that were very well written. Ms. Kitt I really enjoyed this one."
5,IRONCLAD GLOVES,GREAT GLOVES MY SON NOT ONLY WEAR THEM ON HIS JOB WHERE HE WORKS OUT SIDE BUILDING HOMES. BUT ALSO WEAR THEM TO TEACH SKING ON THE WEEKENDS. GREAT ALL AROUND GLOVE.
2,Oh man,"Chain Gang Girls had so much potential. Hot and sexy Japanese girls being exploited in a prison. But due to a lack of a budget or a lack of imagination, we are left with a mundane girls in prison movie."
4,"An excellent, light hearted success guide.",I thoroughly enjoyed the entire Rhinoceross Success series. An excellent series of books with a different style to help change my attitude towards success.
1,Unenlightened,"I cannot believe, in this age, one is still able to purchase a book with such hideously backward and uninformed views. The underlying message of the text is profoundly alarming. Alexander is wholly consumed by the hollow notion of the American dream: that, somehow, everybody can succeed if only they worked that bit harder. Unfortunately, life is not so simple. Millions of Americans are born in to poverty; millions die in poverty. Alexander's quasi-religious principles betray his personal background and his simplistic solutions do not address the realities of those who really do need 'motivation'.If you prefer to be comforted by such views as, 'It is actually the poor who sponge off the rich,' then this book is for you. But if you have any kind of modern social perception, understanding or awareness, then this book will sicken you as it did me.A disturbing read."
5,Wonderful Book!,"It is funny that the description of this book online says the main character is a boy, when in fact the author leaves the gender to be decided by the reader. My children (3 boys & 1 girl) love this book, and no one ever says anything about boy or girl. We have given this book many times as a birthday gift and have always had rave reviews for it. Highly reccommed for every house with children!"
2,Blegh!,"I got this game hoping it would be just as good as any sonic game on the market, maybe even better! This game is WAY to easy. Don't get me wrong, the graphics are incredibale! There is just no point to this game. My friend also has this, or I should say HAD it. He smashed it and threw it in the trash he hated it so much. Don't buy this. Get sonic and knucles instead."
4,"A revamp of the genesis game, a must play for any saturn gamer","Being a kid growing up with the short lived Sega Saturn can mean lots of good memories.And Sonic 3D Blast is one of mine!Unlike its fast paced original side 2D platforming, Sonic 3D Blast is a step in a different direction.A unique isometric Sonic game.Sonic must rescue the trapped flicky birds and save Flicky Island from Robotnik's clutches!While for some the gameplay is tedious and slow, others may enjoy a change of pace and enjoy the ability to explore enviornments and hidden passages, and the engaging 3D special stages and beautifully composed tracks by Richard Jacques.NOT for the average hardcore Sonic fan."
4,Sunrise at Campobello,Really a great dvd about FDR before he became President. About half of the movie is factual. The other half is for effect.
1,The worst smell perfume ever,"After purchased it, I returned it right away. It's the worst smell ever perfume. It's smell like diarhea medication."
3,wish it lasted longer,I love this perfume but unfortunately it doesn't last long at all. I bought the lotion also to see if applying both would make it last longer. Hopefully it will. It smells so good if philosophy would only find a way to improve it's ability to last.
2,Disappointing,"Altman is Altman, and this overlong epic is full of his most characteristic habits of film-making. As usual, there is a sharply critical edge to his semi-satirical portrait of America. Unfortunately, however, it lacks any narrative drive whatsoever, which might not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that nothing else compensates for this. The characters are devoid of warmth; there is insufficient reason for us even to care what happens to them.Fans of country music may well find it a more pleasurable experience: I happen to loathe most country and western, so I found the extended musical episodes barely tolerable. Watching Nashville is like watching a life unfold only from a distance; this detachment is fatal to a merely intermittently interesting film."
1,bad yellow,"What a pity : such a great film, such a bad dvd. It's yellow all the way through, or am I color blind?"
1,You Folks ARE Kidding (Aren't You),"This is the ONLY movie that I have seen where I ACTUALLY ASKED FOR A REFUND when it ended. Someone said that Altman 'wove the plot strands together' - bull. I recall several very THIN story strands ... but they never came together in my mind & certainly could never be added up to qualify as a 'plot'.And as far as my ""One Star"" rating goes - it's only because there isn't a negative 5 choice."
5,Great Film! Classic Robert Altman,"I consider Nashville to be one of Robert Altman's best films. If you are a fan of the film and are looking for tons of extra features then you might be a little disappointed with the DVD. That being said, the DVD does include an interview with Robert Altman as well as commentary by Robert Altman which I really enjoyed. For me this DVD is a must have for anyone who is a fan of Robert Altman and it's not a bad purchase for someone who loves great movies."
5,An American Quilt,"A seminal movie in American film history, this shows Altman at his early, novelistic best. Sets of characters come and go, cross paths then recross. From the airport, to the Grand Ole Opry, to the Parthenon, Altmans' ablility to see the individual in the grand scheme of the vast American landscape is beautifully evidenced in this picture. A Bittersweet Love Song to American Country Music."
5,Adult and contemporary film at its finest.,"This is a fine hybrid of a movie that defies definition because inherently its purpose is to defy the concept of what a good movie has to be. This film is great because of the ideas, music,actors,direction all coming together to expose America and to celebrate its triumphs and its deficiencies in an adult and thought-provoking way. Every scene has meaning, comedy or music that relates to the human condition---it is a shame that after the 1970's movies abandoned individuality and risk taking. Creating a movie just to be different can be sniffed a mile away, but one that is different, intelligent and understands how people may act is a rare find indeed like this one."
4,NASHVILLE,"This is probably my favoirte 'modern' film. It's not my favorite all-time film, that is still SUNSET BLVD, but this one, taken at its original release, was the most innovative, stunning picture I'd ever seen. It's fragmentary, non-linear plotline, dazzling collection of actors, and incredible diretorial style was miles beyond anything else on the planet in '75. The things that Altman did here were radical, then, and have influenced filmmaking ever since. Such highly praised crap as PULP FICTION and CRASH wouldn't exist if it wasn't for NASHVILLE. Their over-hyped directorial styles are just copies of this original. Of course, i'm a total sucker for most of the other Altmans, too.The lower rating is because of the quality of the disc, a very early dvd (and laser,) with no extras... no commentary, on a film that cries out for one."
1,A disaster that only critics loved,"Three hours of improvisation and ""loose as a goose"" directing that should have been edited down to 70 minutes. Altman connects dozens of characters and sub-plots with that old Hollywood standby, an assassination. Unfortunately, that doesn't resolve any of the plots. It only ends the film. Abruptly. VERY abruptly. Boring, pointless, a film that begins to unravel in the first ten minutes and never recovers."
2,A Tale of Pots and Kettles,"Hollywood calling Nashville phony? Think about it. And the mediocre songs in this movie weren't really representative of country music; they were piss-poor imitations of country music, written by Hollywood. For the most part, with a few rare exceptions, actors can't sing and singers can't act. But that doesn't stop them from trying.A lot of great things came out of Nashville, back when it was real. A lot of mediocrity has come out of Hollywood, and still does, today more than ever. Like this movie."
2,A one hour idea stretched to almost three hours,"I found this movie to be almost unwatchable. If your idea of a good time is watching Henry Gibson trying to sing while the camera takes long pans over dull crowd scenes, then this movie is for you. The three minutes of excitement near the end barely has anything to do with anything that preceeded it. Altman can pull off such greats as ""Mash"" and ""Godsford Park"" and then stink up the joint with this. What's up with that?"
1,Don't believe the hype,"What an absolute bore-fest! If you're not a fan of country music, stay far, far away from this movie - there must've been at least an hour and a half spent just on performances of some god-awful kuntry sangin'. And the rest of the time went like this: let's put 13 people on screen at once and have them all mumble inanities to each other, and we'll see if the audience can make out anything interesting (I never did, needles to say). In addition, it had no visual appeal at all, looking like a bad home movie. Don't waste your time on this one."
1,Nice movie to spend an evening,"This Altman classic is the perfect movie to spend the night with. Pour yourself a bubble bath, light some candles and put the DVD in your portable DVD player. Enjoy the warm bath while you watch this movie. As the opening scene begins drop the player into the bath.The electrocution will be less painful that watching two hours and forty minutes of characters no one cares about and and ending which makes you wish you had a way to clean out your memory with bleach."
1,I only gave it one star because there's no zero star option,"This is one of the most dreadfully bad movies ever made. Yet so many people proclaim its greatness. Hey, you guys--I've got a set of beautiful new clothes for sale. Worn only once by an emperor."
4,Interesting Take on the Human Culture,"Robert Altman's (M*A*S*H (Widescreen Edition),The Player (Special Edition) (New Line Platinum Series)) ensemble piece Nashville is an intelligent, scatterbrain, interesting take on the human culture. Although Nashville, Tennessee is the setting it could have been told anywhere. It moves through, telling us about characters rather than a story. One everyone should see.This DVD edition features a commentary by Altman and an Interview with him.Highly recommended."
4,Great Film Old DVD Criterion edition?,"This was produced at the end of the 90's as an early generation DVD and is pretty good quality for the time, anamorphic transfer, and full length Altman commentary... Maybe it could be revisited by Criterion but for present it's the only edition of Altman's landmark 1970's ensemble drama, a satire on American politics, C&W music, and virtually everything else... 24 characters feature, and director handles their ballet with a matchless grace and ease, reminding just what a great filmmaker he was... A career best!..."
4,very very good,This movie could get a 5 star rating if the copy of the film was better...bad audio and video. This print needs a digital upgrade!
5,DON'T BLINK,"This captivating film demands your attention. So many things happen, it is a bit hard to follow. Each scene is a vignette; thougtfully sculpted to fit in to the jig saw. One moment you're up, the next you're down. The camera angles are perfect as you at once feel part of the crowd. It's been 25 years since I've seen it, but I recall it as equal parts soap opera, and satire. Bring some kleenex."
3,"Interesting movie, but slightly insulting...","I have a copy of this movie because there are shots of Nashville and places I used to go. I first saw this film before I was a professional fiddle player and I still believed all the cliché about Country Music. Later I ended up working and living in Nashville working in the Opryland Amusement Park and now I understand why some of my friends there felt slightly insulted and betrayed by this film. Certainly there are jerks in Nashville, just like any place else, and nobody in Nashville is actually from Nashville.... but, most of the folks I got to know in Nashville were very down to earth wonderful people. Oh and I've met Keith Caradine too, right here in Spring City, Pa of all places."
5,Another Altman Masterpiece,"Director Robert Altman had proven himself as an important and inventive new filmmaker before Nashvillle. MASH immediately comes to mind, but others such as Images, The Long Goodbye and McCabe show what Altman could do with film, each in a different way. Nashville seems like a logical choice for Altman in 75. It was his most ambitious project to date and had a cast of dozens. The film turned out to be Altman's masterpiece and has been his movie to beat for over thirty years. Great performaces by all and some great and not so great country music."
3,A movie which can be a bore or an inspiration according to taste...,"Altman's democratic style, whereby spectators 'take part' in the film by choosing from the tedious soundtrack and widescreen gallery of characters whatever they want to hear and see, reached its zenith in ""Nashville.""An epic account of a week in the lives of 24 musicians and fans attending a country music festival, its fragmented Impressionist observations retain an amazing emotional poignancy; its seething tapestry of contemporary American life is deceptively informal, its tightly-woven patterns cleverly concealed beneath a veneer of naturalism...Certainly many exciting moments pass by, but the length is self-defeating..."
5,Clinician,Parallels the DSMIV very well A good preparation guide for the counselor certification exam.
3,Good stuff for old skin.,This is a good product but the hemp butter made by Moist & sold by Sally Beauty Products was much better. Sally Beauty discontinued that product.This product works well on very dry skin & is absorbed quickly.
3,body butter,"My wife likes the butter go on smooth and not too greasy. I did not find it to work too well, you need to reply after washing your hands to stay soft."
2,So disappointed - not for really dry skin,"I buy a body butter from a spa in Portland, OR - but it's incredibly expensive. I thought I'd try this instead - but it didn't work out. This product burned when applied, and my skin was completely dry again less than 20 minutes later. I tried using it several times just to be sure I didn't like it - it certainly doesn't make my skin soft. I'm sure for people who mildly dry skin it might be enough, but I have VERY dry skin and this did nothing to help that."
4,I love Hempz products but.....,"I use the original body lotion by Hempz and love it. The smell is light and wonderful. The fact that it absorbs in quickly and isn't greasy is also a plus. When I saw they had the original in body butter I thought how wonderful to have this for my extra dry skin in the winter. When it arrived the first thing I noticed is that it didn't have that light sweet smell as the original lotion, it had more like a Crisco smell to it. It does still have a light scent, but nothing like the original body lotion. That aside, I still use it and it works wonders on my dry elbows, shins, etc. I just wish it smelled the same as the original. My bad for assuming Body lotion original and body butter original would smell the same."
3,Not as good for psoriasis,"My 6 yr old son has guttate psoriasis. We bought the Body Shops hemp body butter 1st and it worked great at keeping the flair ups and redness down. But the smell is horrible. So the 2nd time we bought this and were super excited because it smelled great. But it lacks the thickness and healing properties of the body shops body butter. It works fantastic for plain old dry skin and hands tho and has a wonderful scent. A sort of banana smell. So I give it 3(ok) for scent and moisturizing, but I believe it doesn't contain enough of the actual hemp healing properties that we were looking for. We will go back to the stinky stuff for that. :)"
5,"A great, clear, easy guide to grammar rules,tricks and info.","This book changed my life! I took a class in college from tbe author and this was the textbook. I have been in advertising and marketing for the past 12 years and I use this book all the time. It's so easy to use and the info is really clear.The best part is a guide at tbe back that explains the distinctions between commonly misused words. For Example: farther/further (farther--physical distance-throw the ball farther and further --degree,time or quanity - discuss the issue further); since/because (since -- denotes a period of time -it's been many years since we've been together and because gives a reason or cause); irregardless(isn't a word) etc. I recommend this book to everyone--it's great."
5,The Answer to Beginner Grammarians' Nightmares,"This guide wittily walks its readers through the rules of English grammar, breaks down every principle, identifies the most common mistakes among writers and gives excellent insight on how to fix these errors. The last 37 pages (the Topical Guide to Grammar and Word Use) simply list every misconception or fallacy regarding word and punctuation misuse and give quick explanations on how to correct these frequent blunders. This book is an absolutely must for any undergraduate student and I recommend it to even the most professional grammarians. It should be considered beginner grammarians' Bible."
5,Kids love it!,"I am an intern in a kindergarten class right now, and one of the students brought this book in. I read it for the class and they loved it! It is interactive because they get to choose which way to go and this is a perfect age range for kids to start learning about left and right."
2,"Not a bad book, but REALLY inapropriate for children under... what, 16?","Well, it's quite an intriguing book. It has a very complex plot. It is about a bunny named Ben and his little mate Joshua and their... special adventures. It is really not bad, quite good actually. It is an allegory, only quite explicit. Um, let's just say that Ben and Joshua get really close trough the book. REALLY close. Yep, they're close friends alright. They really have eachothers backs.Anyway, we think there ain't enough allegorical sex but whatever. Let kids have their fun and BODY PARTS EDUCATION with this book. We just hope that kids don't try the fun ""games"" they learn from the book on their playmates.We wouldn't if we were you but, hey-it's your money (and kids)."
1,Not up to par!,"I was interested in purchasing this game as I enjoy golf sims. I decided to rent it first just to be on the safe side. I'm glad I did. Cyber Tiger is a very unrealistic golf game. The ball seems to bounce around in a very unusual and artificial way. The sound effect which accompanies this ""bounce"" is unusual too -- it kind of sounds like someone striking a piece of cardboard with a pencil. Speaking of sound, crowds can sometimes be heard but they are nowhere to be seen! On top of this, the terrain, at least on the initial course, is rather bland and is extremely artificial looking which makes it all seem like a worthless venture. I would recommend that everyone wait for the European PGA tour game that will hopefully be available soon."
5,A GREAT GAME TO PLAY WITH YOUR FRIENDS!,"This is a great game to play with your friends and all the characters are cool. Use the codes to get the extra characters, because the ""find a player"" feature is impossible. This game is fun once you get the hang of it. I recommend this game to everyone who likes golf."
2,Cyber Tiger,"This game has ok graphics, and the most cool part is when Tiger changes ages. There aren't many rules in this game"
3,Good Game bad control,"I love command and conquer, but on the saturn its terrible, the controls are the worst, sadly its still one of the better saturn games out there, but if youre not a collector then I recomend just downloading the original since it was actually released by the publisher for free on their website and that one has a lot better controll and less glitches like the level not ending even though you destoreyed literally everything on the map."
5,Very good...worth the money,"I didn't have that adverse a reaction to the narration by Patrick Stewart. It was odd to have him speaking about the subject, but he has a nice voice. Regardless, the documentary was wonderful. It held its own against other movie documentaries out there, having so many different clips. Often, the really old stuff (silent films and the like) are overlooked. This had just the right amount of historical fact and gossipy legend to make a great Hollywood historical film."
4,Not awful,"I learned a great deal about photographing birds with this volume. The other critiques about the book are harsh and perhaps they are from very experienced bird photographers. I am not a newbie by any means but have come to devote more time to this subject in recent years. The concepts of setting up natural looking feeders and using feeders arranged with ""staging branches"", setting up blinds, are not intuitive so I credit the authors with helping me to improve in my photos in the backyard, bribing birds in the park and Cape St Mary's. The list of ""Ways to Get Close to Birds"" at the back of the book is a great reference, showing species and method. Very simple and succinct. Yes, there could be more updated information on recommended infrared triggers etc, but concepts are concepts. They don't change. By the way, slow manual focus 500 Mirror lenss are a great affordable way to break into bird photography and see if you want to pursue it. I just sold one for $100. Price a 600mm lately?"
2,what you pay is what you get,after 1 week of light use one of the eyepieces felt. another disappointing point is chromatic aberration that it produces. Save you money for a quality product. I would not buy it again !
1,One look-Back in the Box,"You cant even see a crater on the moon. I had better toy binocs as a kid. Very very poor quality. They were a xmas gift , they went right back in the box and I will spend my gift certificate on something else."
3,Celestrom 20x80,"They are good binoculars, just not as strong as the ones I used to have with the same power. With those you could see the moons around Jupiter, and so far not with these. I would recommend them as a good starter unit, but do use a tripod. they do get heavy!"
4,Incredible value for the price,These binoculars are an incredible deal for the price. I use them for viewing ships on the water from shore. The optics are adequate for what I am doing. I also have some high end Fujinon Binoculars that are 5x the cost that have much better optics but for the price and the magnification you get you cannot beat these binoculars. Was able to see the rings in Saturn on a clear night although the image was a little fuzzy. You do have to mount these on a tripod for steady viewing since handheld is just not steady enough when using this level of magnification. I would recommend these binoculars just from the standpoint of incredible value for the magnification you get.
1,buy something lighter,"Last year I bought celestron Noble 10 x 50 bins and was so and still am very pleased with five plus star rating.... got them on closeout at around $120 (list price around 300). Wanting to see better details in the night sky, and preferring portable and casual bins to a telescope, I had high expections because this skymaster has more than twice the light gather capability of my Noble. Bottom line, total disapointment as I could see nothing in the skymaster that I could not make out with my Nobles. These bins are HUGE (I knew that) and heavy and bulky and a pain to use compared to lighter bins. If you can afford it, you are much better off with a light, portable pair with higher quality glass and better coating."
5,Celestron SkyMaster 20x80 Binoculars,"Great binoculars, perfect for multiple uses.Good Points:- Great value for the money.- good quality, great alignment- easy to use, much more portable than a telescope (and you get to use both eyes too).- 20x power really brings things in close.- work great for daytime observing as well as astronomical use.Watch out for:- as with any high powered binocular, these really magnify your motions making things appear jittery. You need to be steady or lean against something to get a clear view.- you will want a tripod for most critical uses- they are heavy, so if you hand-hold them, your arms will get tired fast."
4,Easier Than a Telescope,"Great product. Much easier to use than a telescope. We've looked at Jupiter and 4 of its moons, and great views of the moon. Hoping to catch a view of a comet later this month. Certainly you can find more magnification with the higher end telescopes, but for the money these binoculars are perfect if you're looking for a quick setup and easy viewing. Highly recommend using with a tripod because at 8+ pounds they get heavy fast when handholding which causes jumpy images."
4,Good view for the buck!,"i first bought the 25-125x80 zoom binoculars, i returned them to amazon, (which was a fast a quick & flawless return process) due to the fact that zoom is not all you think it is... well, the 125x80mm did zoom okay and you could view things more close, it did result in a decreased field of view, and a double vison effect at higher zoom rates, so I exchanged them for a pair of 20x80mm binocs of the same brand, and found the new pair at a fixed zoom, is a much better pair, easy to view and much more light! the stars POP out, and everything is bright and wide and easy to look at.. remember - bigger (zoom) is not always better- if you want zoom- save up and buy a nice telescope (5"" or better), but for around $100 these work well. - stay with a fixed magnification pair."
2,"Useless for birding, poor focus","I know that these are mostly used for astronomy. I thought they might be good for small birds, up high in trees, and so on. In theory, this could work. In practice, they won't focus closer than 100 yards. The focus is fuzzy at that distance, or any other distance, as far as I could tell, and the focus is fuzzier on the left side than the right. Might be okay for astronomy. I didn't try that. Maybe there are quality control problems at the factory or something. Disappointing. I had to return them."
2,Very disappointed,"The Celestron SkyMaster 20x80 Binoculars were a huge disappointment to me. First of all, the eyepieces were too close together. Even at their widest point, they would not line up with my eyes. Also, the adjustment for focus was far too difficult. I had to apply so much pressure to try to get them to focus, it felt like they were going to break, and I could not get both eyes in focus together. And finally, even looking up at a clear sky, far out in the country, the amount of light these let in was poor. Even though I knew these were inexpensive, I guess I expected too much based on the reviews here at Amazon. For now I will stick with my old 10x70 Nikons until I can afford to buy better glass. The only good things I can say about the SkyMasters are that they look impressive and they mount nicely to my tripod. I returned them to Amazon."
2,Confusing product information,"Read below - copied from the blurb above on these binoculars. These binoculars have a 4mm exit pupilThe exit pupil size -- the diameter of the objective lens divided by the magnification -- determines the amount of light available to your eye. The larger the exit pupil, the brighter the image obtained will be. A three-millimeter exit pupil is generally sufficient for daytime use, five-millimeters is suitable for daytime and twilight, and seven-millimeters is generally necessary for maximum nighttime or astronomy use.Why do they say they're stargazing binoculars when they only have a 4mm exit pupil? They wrote just above that you need a 7mm exist pupil for astronmy."
2,Celestron Sky Master 20x80 binocs,"I was hoping to accomplish a bit of star gazing, planets etc. with these. For some reason when the moon was straight up in the sky, I could not view it without lifting my camera tripod off the ground on one side. Maybe it is a function of my tripod, not sure, but returned this product."
3,hard to fit my nose in,"The optics are very clear for the money, and the design is reasonably solid. I had a problem with the eyecups and getting my eyes the right distance from the lenses. First off, there is nowhere near enough eye relief to allow use with eyeglasses. With the cups extended, my eyes were too far from the lenses. With the cups folded, i couldn't fit my nose between the eyepieces. If these fit your face, you won't find a much better deal in big binoculars."
2,Not like the other pair of Celestron's I own,"I owned another pair of Celestron's the Ultima 10x50 which worked well and cost quite a bit more if I remember correctly. I thought I would buy these for some added reach. There were two problems. Could not get the right eye to come into focus, not enough adjustment. Second, it would be better if they opened up more. They seem suited for someone with eyes close together. It just felt cramped. On a positive note, build quality seemed okay in contrary to some other reviews. I returned these and Amazon has one of the best return policies."
4,Why is this not on DVD?,"Kenny Loggins hosted this 1992 environmental special ""This Island Earth"" about protecting our enviromnment. It aired on the Disney Channel back in the ""days of Pooh"" and also features Gloria Estefan and Shanice. But Loggins is the star and even won a Daytime Emmy for the title song which did not become a single but came out on hisUnimaginable Lifealbum a few years later. It has wonderful views of nature and also includes Loggins' environmental anthem ""Conviction of the Heart"". Hopefully one of the producers wil issue this on DVD one day."
5,fenwicks-eudaimonia,"another outstanding album from the long-silent camp of the fenwicks. this full-band effort features more elliptical lyrics than their earlier effort but the musicianship and bouncy energy of the first album are all here again, perhaps even more so than before ... there really isn't anyone else in the world who writes brooding lyrics quite the way Mr. Schub does ... consistently inventive, catchy and uncategorizable. Serves the function of pop music for those consistently unable to listen to any of the drivel that usually brings home the bucks."
2,Doom for the Saturn,"This game is a bad version of Doom.Halfly do you see the same things beetween the PC version and the Saturn port.It said on the box that they would have multiplayer deathmatch-none are in this game!Avoid the game,I say.Get it for PS,PC,GBA,32X or SNES,but not for Saturn."
5,Can't leave home without them,Bought a couple of DS lites in sales. One didn't have DC. One didn't have AC. Two stones with one package. Work perfect. Nice to have the extra battery.
3,DS Lite power Pak,Nintendo DS Lite Power Pak 3 in 1 Bundle BlackThis item is useful ... it works but the plug could be made to fit a little more tightly ...a little loose.
3,Not As Good As First 2 Seasons,We have the first 2 seasons and they were both excellent. Season 3 & 4 we ordered and have viewed at least once. Season 4 is better than season 3 only from the standpoint that all 2 DVD's actually contain mysteries! The actors were very hard to understand with their heavy British (Manchester) accents for some reason as compared to the first 2 sets. For what I paid and this includes bonus point credits both Seasons 3 & 4 are way overpriced. This will be our last purchase as to Blue Murder.
2,A real disappointment.,"I was looking forward to Blue Murder, since I usually enjoy the British mysteries. This fourth season--I didn't see the rest--was a loser. Bad plotting and stock characters-cop goes undercover in prison and gets found out, etc."
1,blue murder set 4,"this was a poor imitation of another series looked like every one was reading from cue cards,Caroline Quentin was not very good as the guv in fact didnt like the show wont get the other dvd's"
4,An odd game,"I picked this up mainly because of the used price and curiosity of what this was like. It's okay for what it was worth back when it came out, and the system it was on; you kinda feel it could have been done better though.At least I can start somewhere with my Saturn collection."
5,Perfect for any graphic novel or cartoon-oriented library,"The Extraordinary Works of Alan Moore: Indispensable Edition covers the works of a world-famous comic book artist and reclusive British actor who tells his own story of his life, work and influences. A series of interviews blends with black and white representations of his many works in this fine biography of the writer of watchmen and V for Vendetta, perfect for any graphic novel or cartoon-oriented library."
5,Amazon screw up,"I didn't want to give this a low star review as i have never seen this book. I ordered it, but was then told it was not available. Then Amazon sent me an email asking me to review it!!!I'd love to say something about this book as I am a huge Alan Moore fan but haven't read it."
2,challangeLESS,"The puzzles in this book seem to be intended for very young ages. The questions did not stimulate my mind and the explanations were not that clear. Elementary school students might enjoy this book, but if you're older I would recommend a different book with tougher questions."
3,The writing gets in the way of the advice.,"This book has a lot of very useful information in it. While it's not for a beginner, I as a beginner am learning a lot from it. I appreciate the period section.However, I'm glad I bought it used because of the writing quality. The author is downright condescending toward ""everyday"" commercial make-up and (it seems to me) anyone who is not a makeup artist but nevertheless uses makeup in some form. I understand that this book is about PROFESSIONAL makeup, not amateur or costume, but unless you're already an established professional with a full kit of professional cosmetics you are probably going to feel insulted.I understand that once I am a professional I will need to have a thick skin, but I don't pay people to degrade me, which is what I feel this book does."
4,Must have,"I don't know any professional makeup artist that hasn't owned/read this book.Its been around forever so a few products are a little out dated and there are more things on the market today, but all the basics you will ever need are here and well written and easy to understand; in my opinion a must have for any makeup artist, no matter what the skill level."
2,For the established Professional,"This book is for a more established professional, and not for one interested in the fashion industy. It was very hard to understand to me since I am a novice at applying makeup. This book is not worth the price."
3,Mostly Black & White Photos!,"You would think that a book on makeup -- especially at this price -- would contain many more color photographs. After all, successful makeup is dependent upon illusions of color as well as light and shadow.That said, I did learn a great deal from the book, particularly the chapter on human aging. This is a good book if you are as interested in makeup theory as you are technique."
3,The Technique of the Professional Make-Up Artist,"Extremely informative book, but definitely NOT for a novice. If you do not have experience in photography, television and an expansive knowledge of the different types of make-up, the types of make-up may sound foreign. There are no specific name brands mentioned, just color codes (ie: RCMA). The flow of the book is much like that of a textbook and is reminiscent of being in school (which isn't a horrible thing). For some reason I was expecting picture tutorials and step-by-step examples, but the entire book is in black and white (the only color picture is on the back of the book) so you can't get a full appreciation of what they are talking about without reading. If you are buying this book for information purposes, it will be an excellent buy; however, if you are a visual learner and not big on reading and you are expecting a book full of color and step by step tutorials, you will be sorely disappointed."
2,Dated,"The version I have was last published in 1995. The author is still talking about black and white TV as if it's still in vogue. This book is not highly comprehensive and has very poor direction. There are a lot of words in this book and not enough step by step directions with pictures. Also, this book is in black and white, so it's hard to see what colors he's talking about.I'm glad I've enrolled in make up school and am not going to rely solely on this book. I will use this book as a guide though."
2,More of a bleh kind of item.,"I wanted something cute and stylish for my new Blackberry, and I thought this would do. Looking basically spray painted and very bulky I have to say I was not impressed. If you want it to be a hassle getting your phone when it rings- yeah don't get this. I can't stress enough how hard it was just to simply answer a call. The fitting is tight and the screen smudges up just when I need to use it. I gave the product to my sister and am ordering a clear case that can easily be taken off a belt. I suggest that for anyone who wanted this as well."
5,Socket/Cord replacement,This product worked like a dream. The longer cord helped. There was very little effort required. Would recommend to anyone.
4,Adaptible,This has been adapted to fit a hymilaian salt lamp. I'm enjoying the product's unmentioned versatility and would of course recommend it.
1,DOA,"Well, technically it did power one fan but what's the point of that. It's jeznunk. I got another three splitters of a different brand and I'm powering 4 fans where this one could only do one.Just built a system and out of $900+ worth of parts, this is the only one that failed."
5,"Well Built, Heavy Duty","Who writes a review on sawhorses? Well, there are very few products out there that actually give you the feeling that you got what you paid for, and maybe even a little bit more.These are very well put together sawhorses. They're very well built with heavy gauge metal and are rock solid. I'm very picky about what I buy and base most of my purchases off of research and reviews: You won't be disappointed with these."
2,Not What I Had Hoped For,"Somewhat interesting from a historical perspective, but overall, my view is this is a very dated book that pays very little attention to the California aspect of Highway 40s history."
5,North of Everything--one of the best,My 14-year old daughter couldn't put it down. The neighbor's boy snagged it before my 21-year old son could get his mitts on it. My wife and I both read it. It's moving and compelling and reads like the wind.
5,Not to be Missed,"I started the Virginia Lanier series on the recommendations of the customer reviews. I wasn't disappointed. How interesting could a series be that spotlights the raising and using of bloodhounds in the field? I too wondered and happily found out. The only thing I can add to the other reviews is that after having bought all the books, I learned not to read them back to back. Although throughout the books, she earns the love and respect of not only current, but new friends and people she works with, her personal life is not always the most uplifting. Would I still recommend the series? -- it's not to be missed..."
5,Good book.,I love the whole series of bloodhound books. They are very entertaining and sharp witted.
3,Second and sadly disappointing,"When I bought the series one of the series, I feel in love with the way the album brings to you the best from 3 decades and no tracks seems too different each other that I releaised truly music has no boundary of time. However, when I bought the second installment ... sad to say I was disappointed.The mixing did not seems as seamless as before and the choices were not as quirky and the previous installment. On the whole it was still a very listenable disc, since the tracks are still classic in its own time and well, still deserve a listen."
2,"Rich in variations, lacking in explanations","Unless you're a high Class A player, you'd do well to avoid this one. It's practically an encyclopedia of the Petroff Defense, comprehensive in its presentation of variations and sub-variations--just the kind of opening guide that average players DON'T need.This book bucks a trend in opening works published in recent years in that it's very high on notation, quite low on words that explain the ideas behind the opening. To paraphrase Lev Alburt, former U.S. chess champion and respected teacher and author, opening theory changes with the times, but ideas remain constant.Sadly, to my knowledge, I can't think of a reasonable alternative to this guide for those interested in the Petroff. Titles by Dvoretsky and Karpov follow along similar lines. My guess is that this opening hasn't yet gained enough respect and/or credibility (""playability,"" for want of a better word) to inspire a book that explains the ""whys"" behind this ambitious defense.(...)"
3,"Good for understanding the defense, that's it.","If you play the Petroff or just want to be prepared as white, then it will not hurt to take a look at this book. It is definitely not my favorite Petroff book and it is outdated in terms of variations (as you might expect) but it will help you in your understanding of the defense. Good addition to your Chess library."
3,Watch out for the weird notation and terrible problems,"While the discussion in this book is probably all accurate, the book has two problems that make it better suited as a supplemental reference than a course text. First, the author uses a very strange notation for transforms that seems to be of his own devising. Second, a number of the problems are poorly written making it very hard to see what he is even asking. A third problem worth noting is that there doesn't seem to be a Fourier transform table anywhere in the book. If you are coming to this book from other DSP texts or Signals and Systems books get ready to work just to figure out what he's talking about."
5,A nice textbook,"Several things I liked about this book:a. Concise.b. The order of the book (better than oppenheim's book). CTFT, DTFT, Sampling Theorem, DTF, FFT, Spetral Analysis are all related to Fourier analysis. Oppenheim's book has filter desgin in between, I don't know why he did that.c. I like the examples and questions provided in this book. For example, the example about the Nyquist-T spectrum, the example about the passband signal direct sampling...very thoughtful, useful examples for engineers.Things I don't like:a. The book is kind of weak on Sampling theorem and DFT. I don't know why the author wants to cut DFS, i think it's quiet useful to understand DFT.I don't recommend this book for self-study (oppenheim's book is better with more details). However, it's a good concise textbook given the condition that there is an experienced intructor guiding the students. I'd like to use this book as textbook if I become a professor in the future."
4,Easy to use design of digital filters,I'm an electronic engineer.I wanted to learn how to design digital filters. This book is very straight forward and all the matlab macros are included so that you can implement the filter design functions by yourself. I used visual basic in Excel. Its the best book so far I have read on how to design digital filters and what is the difference between the kind of filters and windows you choose. Now it is much easier to understand how to use the Matlab functions needed. It thorougly describes pros and cons of different filter types. Both FIR and IIR filters are covered.For IIR filters different implementations are described.A little about number of bits needed for coefficients.
3,A reasonable introduction about Duce's life,"I read this book, here in Brazil, when I was a child.This book has many photos(all black & white) and you can read it, in less than two hours.This book is an introduction about Mussolini's life.That despicable man, who had Italy on his hands during more than 20 years, is the subject of this book.This book is a short and easy to read, introduction about Mussolini's life.Details about Mussolini's life aren't in this book.To example:When Mussolini went to be an eugenicist?In 1929, following american's advices; among these american eugenicists was Charles B. Davenport.Yes, Mussolini became an eugenicist even before to met with Hitler.Correct, but this detail about Mussolini's life isn't present on this book.This book is a reasonable introduction about Mussolini's life; nothing more or less than this."
3,Family Obligations,"Delia was not looking for a quick one night, but she got it and a baby in the process. Andrew Hanson was a younger, careless brother to an entire family business. He did not care to take responsibility, but his brothers were all bound and he reluctantly joined in after his funds were cut off.Delia and Andrew's romance is not intuitive, they spend much of the book sidestepping each other.The Baby Deal is not a great story, but it will just satisfy for a few quiet moments."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,"Never received this item, ordered it 5 months ago but alas I forgot about it, until I was reviewing another seller. If the ""bookstore"" I ordered this from still has the item, YES I would like it sent and then I will revise this review"
5,Marcos does it again!,"AX is a great band with their own unique sound, yet you can still distinguish Marcos' contribution to the group. If you are looking for a P.O.D. clone, AX probably isn't your best choice, but if you're looking for great music in general, AX is definately worth a listen."
3,POD meets GrammaTrain with a side of Sprung Monkey,First off to all those hater's that have nothing better to do but criticism Christian influenced bands go back to your secular junk and leave the rating up to Christian fans.At first Accident Experiment comes off aggressive yet not as promising as Project 86 first EP. This was a shock due to the list of influences and styles members of Accident Experiment bring to the band.The EP has some major high points though it did quit meet my expectation coming from Marco and Pete. Personally the opening Scream to Breathe is the best song hands down.This EP is good but nothing more then something you can tell your friends about when your listen to your old POD and Grammatrain cd's.
1,Trash,"Sounds like a lot of crappy stuff my friends wrote in high school. I downloaded their music for free off their website, and it wasn't worth my time."
4,iPod Armband,"Lightweight and secures the iPod perfectly. Has the tendency to pinch bare skin a little on the inside of the bicep, but if you wear a long sleeve shirt and place the armband over the sleeve you wont have any problems. Great value for the price."
3,Just okay.,The band is fine but the plastic clip that holds the shuffle is too thick and does not go on easily. I had to shave mine down to be comfortable with the way it fit.
2,Not What I Excpected,The item is well made and arrived quickly but it's way oversize. I could wrap this around my bicep with no problem and I'm a big person. Wrapping around the wrist covers the iPod. The biggest problem is that the clip the iPod goes on to is too small for the newest iPod shuffles. It doesn't begin to fit and now I have something I can't use and nowhere to put the iPod. The pkg had to be destroyed to get it out so it can't be returned. I'm very disdappointed.
3,T2,"For an inexpensive holder that keeps the ipod at a good distance from the ears and away from personal sweat, this is a good piece of equipment. There is no good way to store the cord and earbuds when you are not using them, though -- would have been easy to design a small pocket for this."
2,Not comfortable,"I have the i-pod shuffle and after buying this for the gym, used it once. I just could not get use to it. I prefer to clip the shuffle to my clothes."
1,4th Gen Ipod Shuffle,Note - does not fit newest 4th generation Ipod Shuffle! Clip is too big and will not fit into the Shuffle's clip. Amazon needs to remove this product from being associated with the 4th Gen Shuffle.
2,Clip doesnt fit 4th gen,"This does not fit the newest 4th generation Ipod Shuffle! The clip is too big and will not fit into the Shuffle's clip. Amazon needs to remove this product from being associated with the 4th Gen Shuffle. As this is the only reason I had bought this arm band.The ipod will half way clip on, so I can still use it, but it sits at an angle.As for the quality of the arm band. I think its average, its worth the $8 that I spent on it. Now if only it would have fit my 4th gen Ipod."
2,Do Not Buy for Your 4th Gen iPod Shuffle,I had to cut it down to size so it would fit. And it still doesn't fit right. Amazon needs to stop linking the products.
4,Still Good.,"Alright, Its associated with the new Ipod Shuffle. Even though it was made for that model. I'm here to tell you, IT STILL FITS. The new model still fits in it nice and snug.The other reviews scared me, but when I tried the ipod on it fitted. It also came in good condition and 1 size fits all. I give it a 4."
1,Doesn't work for the new 4g version,"Just got the band for my new 2G shuffle & it won't fit in any way, shape or form. Very aggravating."
2,Look before you buy!!!,"I did not look at them in a store first. If I would have I would have not purchased this item, I DO NOT like the way the shuffle fits on to it."
1,HUGE,"I got this because I wanted something to hook my mp3 player to when I work out... it came and I was excited until I tried it on. It. Is. HUGE. I am an average sized woman, but to get this to stay on my arm I had to cover my player with the strap to adhere to the other side of the band. It was big!"
3,Good product but be careful.,"This is a great product, and it is easy to use. However, be careful. If you have larger than average arms, you won't be able to wear it comfortably."
2,iPod Shuffle Arm Band,"The problem with this item is that it was made for the earlier version on iPod Shuffle, so it does NOT fit on newer shuffles. Microsoft, in thier infinate wisdom, changed the clip size on the back of the shuffle so that even though it looks exactly the same the clip is smaller and there for the clip on this arm band is to big to fit the new shuffles on. Unless you want to cut it down to size do not buy this for the new shuffles"
4,Great,"I just got the Griffin, and I love it! Adjustable, durable, and yes the square shuffle fits it fine. I have mine clipped on easily. So, yeah-it's a good price for the product. Far better priced than at 24.95 I would buy it there too, but 6.00 is far more affordable for the average buyer."
2,Not compatible w/ 4th gen.,"Reading the description, I was under the impression this would work with my fourth generation 2G iPod shuffle. The band quality seems fine and is as pictured, but I cannot use it."
3,X-mas Gift Returned,I purchased this item to go with the shuffle. After my wife opened the shuffle and realized the clip was strong enough to meet her aerobic demands we decided to return the armband.
1,Misleading Descripition,"I own the most recent version of the I Pod shuffle and despite what the packing says, this armband will NOT fit it. Don't waste your time just clip it to your shirt"
1,Does not fit,The holder is too small for the shuffle. I got one for my niece for her birthday but the Shuffle didn't fit at all. Would have returned it but her father tried to sand it down.
2,Griffin Tempo Armband for iPod Shuffle 2G,The Apple iPod shuffle 2GB wouldn't fit properly to the band and kept popping off which you can't have when your trying to work out at the gym.
1,ghfghfh,My ipod shuffle is a small square device and the armband did not fit.....I found another band and it works perfectly......
2,Not for the new generation iPod Shuffles,"I purchased two of the arm bands; one for an existing Shuffle I purchased about 3 years ago and one I purchased with the bands. Try as I might, there is no way the Shuffle will fit onto the band clip. The newer generation iPod Shuffles are smaller than the earlier generation. Bottom line is unless you have a pretty old Shuffle, pass this one up."
1,"DOES NOT FIT THE iPOD SHUFFLE ""2 Gig""","It does not fit the iPod shuffle ""2 Gig"" but it does fit the ""2G"" which is a longer shuffle. This product should not be associated with the ipod shuffle 2 gig."
1,disneygirl,"Buyer error, but I got an armband for the wrong generation of the shuffle, so it is no good to me. A total waste of money. Goodwill will probably enjoy it though! :)"
1,"Total ""Keag-Head Only"" Bootleg","I am sorry but this is awful. I LIKE Phil Keaggy a lot and have several of his CDs. But if this was the first thing I'd ever heard of his, I'd never have bought anything else.Some of the performances are good; maybe one or two very good. NONE of the recordings are good. Of the stuff I downloaded (bought the entire downloadable version) half have been permanently deleted.Phil should be ashamed of himself selling this stuff."
4,Small but effective,"It arrived early and works fine. Does the job for pulling small brads, etc...from trim work where a claw hammer or wonder bar would be too large for the task. I took a fine file to it right from the start to sharpen the teeth a bit as they tool is coated and I wanted a better edge for getting into small crevices. It's not something I use every day but when called on it performs well on light duty tasks."
2,Different the pictured,"What came in the mail was not chromed but a blue cheap paint, Not too of a big deal but in one spot had chipped paint and rust starting to form. This is brand new and at this price point not worth my time to return. Found a nice one cheep at my local hardware store."
3,Smaller than Expected,"Not a bad product, but I was disappointed that it was smaller than I expected, and doesn't give as much support as I thought it would."
4,Comfy!,"This is my second pillow of this kind. It's very neck friendly. I did cut the straps off both ends, I find they are not necessary for me & get in my way. The only thing I don't like about it is the nylon fishing-line type of thread they use on it, it pokes you if you lay on the stitched area."
3,Just Okay - Don't understand the hype,"So I saw a lot of good reviews for this products, so I figured try it out. Its not too expensive and I've wasted more money on horrible products. With that being said, the pillow is just big enough to fit behind your neck so its perfect for travel and when sitting up right. I also found it useful when laying down, but only if propped up by another pillow. I do not think the pillow is good for sleeping regularly at night, because its not big enough, or sturdy enough, at least for me. My biggest complaint about the pillow is the fabric! Its sooo rough! I know its an inexpensive pillow but maybe a satin-y/polyester mix would serve it better. I hate the way this fabric feels on my skin. Feels like a rough cotton."
4,A bit too bulky,"This is a very comfortable pillow, but for traveling on a plane it's just a bit too bulky. I've seen the small ones and this one is a bit big. It would be perfect if there was a size just in the middle."
4,"Works fine, great for TV","Very simple: the product does exactly what it is advertised to do--and at a very reasonable price. I am very pleased with my purchase, and would buy this product again. It is a little softer than other similar products I have purchased, and would prefer if is were a little firmer, but it still works great."
2,Sue Keys,"I have used these pillows for years, but after emailing where I bought them from the first time I was told that now they are made commercially, well now, the ones I have bought in the last two years have beenb tooooo soft and not of the firmness of the earlier ones. I am not happy with the newer commercially made ones.Does anyone know where to buy the firmer ones?"
3,very good but...,I like this a lot for when I'm at work and I watch movies (I work third shift)but its very stiff (for me that is) and in the middle it crickles and I tend not to like that. It does give me support but it could be better.
2,really disappointed,"I had been having a lot of neck pain and read all of the great reviews about this pillow. So, I ordered one. I was really disappointed. The pillow is very stiff. It offers no ""give"" at all. It almost felt like having a fist jammed into my neck and I felt like it was kind of hard to breathe when I tried to use it. If return shipping weren't so expensive, I would send it back. Not recommended."
3,A little thick for me,"Maybe I have a short neck...seem a bit large to me. I would have liked it more if it had been softer and more malleable. I tried sleeping on it and I managed to give myself a stiff neck...not a good idea for me. Overall, I think the product was fine, I just had other expectation."
2,Manufacturer flaw,"I hate to return a cheap item such as this. It would be ok if they would make it so that when you try to remove the label it does not rip the whole product apart. Shame on the manufacturer for not putting quadriple stitching on the other side of the label. Thus, my 2 star review."
2,Uh....,"The Jester Red Pillow I recieved is far different from what is shows on the image, and it looks uglier and uncomfortabler than the image too. I'm a little bit depresed by its quality. And it's kind of too high for me that i feel my head lifted up or pushed forward which makes me really uncomfortable."
1,Need to contact the owner of this and have no way to reach them.,"I have previously ordered a dog bone pillow and was pleasantly surprised that it had a small zipper in the end and since I am short I removed some of the stuffing which made this pillow one of the most comfortable pillows that I have ever had. So I decided to purchase another for my daughter, but when I received it there was ""NO"" zipper. I had to return it and have been trying to reach an owner ever since as I would like to order another with a zipper but have been unsuccessful. If they have another with a zipper I could have already if I could only contact them."
4,Great Pillow but not for everyone,"I bought two of these pillows for a long car trip from NYC to Miami. I installed them a couple days before, and my girlfriend and I tested them out when we drive around town. She absolutely loves hers, while for me it wasn't terribly comfortable. This is due to the height of the back of my seat and it's position compared to my neck. She's 5'6"" and I'm 6'2"" so our heads are at very different levels by the headrest - my DogBones pillow was supporting more of my upper back instead of my neck.We did make use of the second pillow - it makes a great lumbar support pillow, and my gf can't imagine going for a drive without it. Also, I tried it in a different car - w/ taller seats, and it was great. Overall, I think it's a great product but the position is really the deciding factor in whether or not it's comfortable and unfortunately that has a lot to do with the height of the user and the seat."
3,This thing is HUGE!,"This pillow is just what it claims to be & seems to be a good product.However, it is huge. It is (IMO) too large for resting or napping comfortably as it causes the head to be lifted too high & the neck to be bent forward too much for comfort. ( For me...)If I could find one of these at about half this size Id be happy with it. I just want something to support my neck as I lay flat, not force me to look at my toes..."
5,Just what I was looking for,"I received one of these years ago as a gift. I had no idea of how I would use it, but I started sleeping with it and in no time, used it as my pillow instead of my regular one (I used my regular one to hug). I can't sleep well now on a regular pillow. Through the years it began to get old so I purchased this one. It was great and just what I was looking for. For the price, it was great and I won't wait so long the next time I need a new one."
5,Thank God you had one!!!,"I have used bone pillows for YEARS... when my last one started falling apart I went on a local quest; WalMart, Walgreens,and CVS, could NOT find one to replace it. OMG! I HAVE to have one to get a decent night's sleep. In panic, I thought of Amazon... there it was! For the price it would have cost me at the store, was able to get one PLUS the shipping for almost the same price! I had it in my bed and under my neck within three days of ordering. PLEASE KEEP SELLING THESE!DogBones NeckBones Chiropractic Neck Pillow, Medieval Blue"
5,Great For Oseoarthritis!,"I have been using a contour pillow for quite some time, but still wake up with neck pain many mornings. Using the Dog Bones Neck Bones Chiropratic Neck Pillow has made a big improvement. It seems like it helps my lower back pain also! Anyway I bought two of these in case I want to use one at the couch or for travel. Very happy with my purchase."
3,good pillow,It does what it claims to do. Keeps my neck from slipping off the headrest when I fall asleep. Not very firm though. I cannot sleep on it if I'm lying on a bed. It's too flimsy for that but is comfortable in sitting position.
3,Interesting pillow,"I liked the design of the pillow and thought it would be perfect for me but there is too much stuffing, especially on the sides. When using it, I get a similar feeling as if my towel is rolled up and too big - a headache. When I squeeze the sides of the Dog Bones down, it feels a lot more comfortable and like I could sleep with it throughout the night. Perhaps I'll try to tie the sides down with ribbon or slice it open and remove some of the stuffing. For now, I'm sticking to my properly rolled up hand towel."
2,Nothing special and rather hard in the middle,"This item is stuffed very tight and not very comfortable. It's not good for neck support, it mainly just hurts."
5,great pillow,I bought this pillow for my girlfriend she absolute loves it. It was cheap enough and come in time for christmas
2,Depends on your sleep angle,"I didn't like it for sleeping on planes. It is too hard and rigid to wrap it around your neck or head. My dentist has some for lying back in a dentist chair, which makes the procedure more comfy."
2,Ok but not good enough to lug around when flying.,"I took this on 14 hour flights to and from Shanghai. I am 6'3"" and it didn't fit my neck just right and was really thick. I wouldn't buy this again. It takes up a lot of space in my carry on bags and is not as comfortable as airline pillows. I am hoping it works better for watching TV in my recliner at home."
2,overrated product. not soft,Anticipate good product based on reviews but really disappointed. Used on long flight overseas and end up with neck spasms instead. feel hard out of box and material for cover is cheap. Would not recommend.
4,dogbone pillow,"Product was in good condition. Works ok, expected it to be a little firmer, but ala in all satisfactory"
4,good pillow,"I had to buy a second one, girlfriend stole the original. It's good to have around, just takes a little getting used to. I was glad to have it when I broke my foot recently cause I could keep my foot upright when gravity would've pulled it sideways and caused more pain when I was trying to relax or sleep."
3,ok.. kind of a pain,"I bought this for my car. I have a neck problem and needed more support. I thought this would do the ticket.However, while it does give me some neck support, the way I have to attach it to my headrest is a pain.I had to use a carbiner clip to attach the two ends and the whole pillow always slips and moves around and I have to keep readjusting it .It would be nice if they had designed a better attachment mechanism, maybe some velcro or straps to keep it better in place."
4,Great Pillow,"I love this pillow. It really supports my neck. Sometimes I wish it was a bit firmer but most days it is just what I need. Note: It has not gone soft like regular sponge pillows. It has the same firmness as the day I bought it, a few months ago."
4,Good Buy,"This was a good buy! The bone pillow is comfortable, easily transportable and reasonably priced. Great value for the Money!!!!"
5,neckbones pillow,My husband loves his pillow and uses it every day. I recently ordered this for him to replace one he has literally worn out.
3,"Comfortable, but needs work on your part.","I just got this pillow today, and it fits around my neck very well, unfortunately, I have no clue how I'm actually suppose to use it.It has two short loops on the side, which isnt very effective in placing it on any chair I have in my house. I think it'll be a good pillow to use on a flight or during long drives, but its unlikely I'll be using it around the house.Really, am I suppose to wear this like a necklace? Is the strap just for holding?It's comfortable, but I'm just confused."
3,Not as comfortable as expected,"Lots of customers enjoyed this pillow, and I hoped I would too------it just didn""t work for me. My neck still hurt and I couldn't sleep with the pillow at all."
2,To narrow,"This neck pillow was too narrow at it's center to be comfortable for myself.For most, it would probably be fine."
3,Could be better,"This is a cheaply made pillow. The fabric easily attracts dust and fibers and is not removable so cannot be easily washed. The stitching seems sound, however. Overall, I find the product cheap and uncomfortable."
5,The BEST travel pillow there is,"My husband and I were preparing for a couple of trips, one of which was a 9 hour drive in the car. I'd also started reading a lot and noticed I was getting a cramped neck. I looked online for travel pillows. I'd actually started looking for the ones that kinda wrap around your neck but saw how great the reviews were for this and thought, why not?What's not to love? It gives you great neck and head support, and the unique shape keeps your head from flopping one way or the other. We both used these (I bought two of course) for the majority of the road trip. I couldn't have been happier I'd bought them. And now that we're back home, it is used daily while watching tv, doing internet stuff, or napping."
4,Comfortable and works well,At first I thought the pillow was too hard but I got used to it. It offers plenty of support for my neck. I highly recommend it if you have neck pain. The only downside is the cover isn't removeable so I can wash it.
5,surprising relief!,"I have suffered from headaches and migraines for over 15 years. My headaches recently would come in the morning or middle of the night. I was trying a bunch of pillows and other devices out to see if they would help the tension in my neck that causes my migraines most of the time. I bought this pillow thinking that it would be great to support my neck while reading or watching tv. I took it on a trip to Mexico and ended up using it as a pillow while staying in hotels. After that my head felt so much better that I just started sleeping on it every night and I haven't had a full on migraine since! In fact, if my neck feels tense at night, when I wake up, most of time it feels better. I have also found some exercises and a massage therapist that has helped me, but I contribute much of my improvement to this little pillow!! I'm so thankful for it!"
1,Worst neck pillow ever!,"I was experiencing severe neck pain and this pillow was recommended by a friend. As soon as I got it I tried it out, and my neck was actually in worse shape the next day. I sent it back for a refund. There is absolutely nothing special about this pillow -- it's simply a foam pillow in the shape of a dog bone, that is shaped in such a way that you would think it's good for your neck. Beware of this pillow!"
3,"It is ok, but not the best.","The center is too thick. It can fit a big person, but not the small one. It would be great if you can adjust the thickness."
2,Soft it is NOT!,"I bought this pillow a couple of years ago after reading the glowing reviews. I wanted something that would be comfortable, cradle my neck and relieve muscle spasms. What I received was a rock! No comfort - only pain. I really wonder how anyone can call it soft. Not only does it _not_ cradle my neck but it seems to actively _reject_ my neck! Are there different densities of the Dog Bone products? Maybe I got the wrong one...."
5,"OH MY GOSH...IT""S THE BEST!","I got this item the other day after reading the reviews on amazon about how wonderful this product was. I have had neck issues for awhile. I have a computer desk job that is very demanding and contribute alot of my neck soreness to this and stress. I slept on the neck pillow last night and if anyone out there is having the same issues, this is for you!! The pillow is not only very comfortable and conforming to your neck, it gives GREAT support. I also noticed for me anyway, that I didn't toss and turn all night trying to get my neck comfortable. Five stars all the way. I hope this helps!"
