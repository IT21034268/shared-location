5,I couldn't put it down either!,"I have long been of fan of Judy's. I grew up with her heart warming stories. I was hesitant, at first about Summer Sisters. By my fears were put to rest after the first chapter. I could relate to the characters and their feelings and choices. I loved it. Thanks, once again, Judy"
3,Pure pulp,"I had heard the hype about this book and knew Judy Blume as a good kids author, and so I picked up a copy. It is pure pulp; a preposterous story, and one that I could guess what was around each corner. Still, I found it hard to put down and found myself crying near the end. So, although it had little in the way of redeeming value, I did enjoy it."
2,Great book! - If your brain needs a vacation!,"I grew up reading books by Judy Blume so I just felt compelled to read this book! Summer Sisters is the kind of book when you are too stressed and you need some time out. All you have to do is read, you don't even need to think... A very easy read, sometimes slow, but worth reading atleast once- if you're a Judy Blume fan as I used to be."
1,All about sex - NO plot,"While I like ""steam"" in a story as well as the next person, this book really had no plot. It describes the relationship between the two ""Summer Sisters"" but at no point did I feel pulled into the story. It was easy to put the book down when other things beckoned. As much as I've enjoyed other books by Judy Blume this one was a large dissapointment."
3,Pleasant enough,"I wanted to see if Judy Blume could translate her light, fluffy young-adult writing into anything more mature, so I picked up a copy of Summer Sisters and found absolutely nothing new. This book has the same tone, pacing, sparse description and adolescent use of language as her young adult works: the only things added seem to be length and a couple of steamy sex scenes. In the book's favor are its easy reading, quick pace, and the accessibility of its characters. All in all, pleasant enough, but like cotton candy: quickly gone and completely unmemorable."
2,Disappointing...,"I was greatly anticipating reading this novel as I read all of Judy Blume's novels as a teenager, but I found the characters in this novel to be too one-dimensional. I found it difficult to become attached to the characters for this reason. Caitlin's character just became annoying, and I found it difficult to feel any sympathy for her. I also found the writing style to be very flittery and found myself skipping through the story unable to get attached to any of the characters. The storyline was also too soap-opera like and simplistic to feel any kind of depth in this book. You expect to come away from reading this book with a reminder of your close friendships as a teenager, but the storyline and characters were so shallow, I walked away empty. Disappointing."
2,"File this with ""Bridges of Madision County""","I chose this book for our bookclub based on my fond memories of Judy Blume and found it incredibly disappointing. The writing was irritatingly simplistic, the friendship made no sense to me and I could not believe the sudden marriage. WHAT?The one thing I did enjoy was remembering the thrill of my own ""backseat of the car"" escapades.More disillusioning to me than the book itself is that so many of my female peers rave about it. I put it in the same category of Bridges of Madison County which was also horribly written, stupid and much loved by otherwise sharp women."
1,A preteen read with graphic sex,"So like everyone else I was hooked on Judy as a kid, now as a 33 year old woman I expected much more. Judy should give adults more depth to delve into. Sex isn't what seperates an adult novel from that of a prepubesant reader. Sorry Judy, but you found your place in the preteen market, that's where you should stay."
2,A disappointment.,"Like many others here, I remembered reading Blume as a child and teen, and loving her work. I picked up 'Summer Sisters' hoping to experience some sense of nostalgia yet at the same time read something new. The book was fair for about the first half, but somewhere down the line I stopped caring about the characters and what happened to them. It contains none of the great characterization or engrossing story and situations of her other novels.I'd also like to add that though there are adult situations in the book, it is a YA novel through and through. Adults may be put off by the style (I wouldn't have minded if the story had been good.) Teenage girls may enjoy it, but I'm sure they can find something better."
1,Not For Adults!,"As a teenager I read all of Judy Blume's books and absolutely loved them! Thus, I was looking forward to reading Summer Sisters. The book may be a worthwhile read for young adults and teenagers but the notion that it is an adult book is a joke. The characters are all very superficial and the story is banal. In essence, it was a disappointing read."
2,Disappointed,"While I wasn't entirely unhappy with Summer Sisters, I was disappointed... All characters were not developed well at all. Moreover, the short vignettes of each character's thoughts were distracting to me and made me feel even more distanced from the characters. I guess I was expecting more from Blume's adult novels than I got with the adolescent ones (the last Blume novel I read was ""Are You There God?"" which was my absolute favorite book growing up. I read it 5 times). Summer Sisters felt to me like an adolescent novel with more explicit sexual scenes. It's a naughty teenager's dream, like Clan of the Cave Bear without having to skim to find all the racy parts."
2,Beach Blanket Book-o,"The cover, two wooden beach chairs in the sand, tells it like it is: a book about two girl friends who spent summers together. It's a corny tale about friendship between girls vs. love between a boy and a girl. If you expect (as I did) more of the biting wit found in the author's 1978 novel Wifey, you'll soon learn that Summer Sisters is not nearly as clever or as good. But it is a book you might take to the beach, to read in your chair in the sand."
2,A little bit shallow ...,"I bought this book because I was in the mood for an ""easy read"", something that didn't require much effort. This book was just that. But it fell short of my expectations in some ways. It seemed kind of shallow. I think younger readers might really enjoy this book -- it reads much like her books I read as a teenager!If you're looking for an easy read, try it out. Just don't expect too much!"
5,Total Spring Break on the Beach Book.,"I was totally hooked into this book from the first word. As a huge fan of Judy Blume since childhood, I was so excited to see an adult novel by her. I really loved it. I think it's the perfect book for the beach and those lazy days in the sun. CHECK IT OUT!"
5,Great Book,"I am only 13, but I was truly able to relate and enjoy this wonderful book. My friend read this book, and highly recomended it to me. I am really glad she did. After I read it, i recomended it to my other friends, and now most of the girls in our grade have read it. We all enjoyed it, and recomend it to women of any age."
3,Fluffy Good Read,"If you're looking for some light reading which will keep you interested, you've found it with this novel. I enjoyed this book as it takes you back to your childhood/adolescence and lets you experience all the growing pains that go with it all over again (at a time in your life when friends, love interests are the centre of your world). Although I enjoyed this book, I am usually looking for a little more character development in order to truly appreciate and be immersed in the story/lives of the characters. This book did not do that. It may be that the author never intended to go in that direction. Anyway, as I said, if you're looking for light reading, (with losts of sex!)and a fast moving story, this novel will keep your interest!"
5,Excellent,"This book was great! I loved it! I read it while I was on vacation. Blume is a great author. I have read all of hear children/Teen books when I was younger and loved them. This book is of the same quality, if not better, for adult readers. I hope she writes more for adults!"
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"I wasn't sure about this book, but I picked it up because it looked like it could prove interesting. To my surprise it is now one of my all time favorite books. When it ended I wanted to read it again or make Judy Blume write a sequel. She should really consider that!!! This book tells the story of two very unlikely friends, who are worlds apart from each other, but remain summer sisters or best friends through everything - betrayals, family crisis, men, love, etc. It is just such a real story, you can all probably relate to being like Vix and having a Caitlin in your life or maybe you are a Caitlin and your lucky to have a Vix - either way its totally awesome!!!"
1,MISLEADING STORY DESCRIPTION!,I was looking forward to reading a novel by the critically acclaimed author. But the story description is misleading. If want a book about friendships look else where. If you want to hear about little girls getting it on with each other then this is the book for you. I have lost all respect for Judy Blume.
5,Loved it,Read all her books as a teen...so started again when I got new kindle......loved it loved feeling like a teen again reading it...gotta go download next one:)
5,What a great book.....,"I loved this book, I couldn't put it down, and I was disappointed when it ended. I actually felt like I was part of the story, like I was friends with Vix and Caitlin. I must warn you that this book is not for people who get easily disturbed with the use of curse words and talk of sexuality. (The only reason I mention this is I know people who are bothered by this)but honestly it didn't bother me at all, it was a very humorous and emotional story that I enjoyed. I can't wait until she comes out with another book, as I love every single novel she's written."
2,"Judy, You're Better Than This!","Reviewed June 13, 1998The cover, two wooden beach chairs in the sand, tells it like it is: a book about two girl friends who spent summers together. It's a corny tale about friendship between girls vs. love between a boy and a girl. If you expect (as I did) more of the biting wit found in the author's 1988 novel Wifey, you'll soon learn that Summer Sisters is not nearly as clever or as good. But it is a book you might take to the beach, to read in your chair in the sand."
5,A very good book,"I absolutely loved Summer Sisters. Judy Blume did an excellent job on this book. It is by far the best book I've ever read in my life. I opened up the first page and didn't put it down until I was finished with the last page. You just want to keep reading and reading until there is no more. Its exciting, drama filled, emotion filled book and I recommend this book heavily."
2,A Lifetime Movie in a Book,"I did not feel that anything connected in ""Summer Sisters""The characters were people I didn't really care about or identify with, no depth, to tell you the truth, no substance.I adore female bonding, relationships, gossip, confiding to one another about our deepest, darkest secrets, but ... nothing happened in ""Summer Sisters"" that held my interest.I didn't understand why they became friends to begin with, since they had nothing in common. And when they experimented with lesbian sex, calling it ""The Power"" I thought, is that the only power you have, baby?! Even the sex was bad!""Summer Sisters"" is like a ""Lifetime"" movie that was thrown together at the spur of the moment...This despartely shows.Nothing in this book worked...except when I turned the last page."
5,Absolutely Enchanting!,"This book is definitely on my all-time favorites list. It chronicles the evolution of a friendship between two girls. At times shocking and apalling, this book will surely be a favorite of women for lifetimes to come. If you haven't read it, I suggest you do so now."
4,Friends Forever,"Two very different girls, Caitlin living a life of privilege and luxury, and Victoria (Vix) a girl who lives in a dysfunctional poor family, become friends and spend their summers together at Caitlin's father's home in Martha's Vineyard. Here the girls become ""Summer Sisters"".Over their adolescent years Vix and Caitlin learn many alessons together such as sexuality, boys, dating, love, and betrayal.A great, quick, exciting, sometimes erotic, read."
2,Blume should stick to writing books for children,I was excited to read this book. As a child I had read Ms. Blume's books and recall really enjoying them. This book left me with nothing. I did not care about the characters. The story was predictable and contrived. The main character could have chosen her friends better and I should have chosen a better book.
3,candy for the brain,"This book is by no means high quality literature--I call it ""candy for the brain""--but we all need a little of that from time to time. As far as an easy, mindless, escapist read goes, this is one of the best I've come across."
3,"A good story, but too jumpy.","Summer Sisters, by Judy Blume, is a great story about a friendship that lasts for twenty years. The author uses valuable historical facts from the seventies, eighties, and early nineties, adding a nice touch to the book. However, it skips to fast from event to event in some places in the novel. The ending was very surprising, but some things were very predictable leading up to the ending. What a sad but wonderful story. The events surrounding puberty and other life altering events is wonderful throughout the book. Between chapters, the author added insight to characters' thoughts. It was very easy to read, but I wish the chapters flowed more."
1,Too bad you can't give 0 stars,"I was so excited that the woman who shaped my pre-teen and teenage years had come out with a book that I thought would shape my mid-twenties...so I bought the hardcover 2 days after it came out. I have never been so disappointed in an author! I read the book with half interest--Blume fails to develop her characters and any sort of plot, which is sad because there was so much potential. I got the feeling that she wrote the book with the hopes of being recommended by Oprah...I hope Oprah saves her money--or she can get mine at our garage sale next week."
2,Where has the old Judy gone?,"I adored Judy Blume when I was growing up, and I wanted to be a writer just like her. I read every one of her books during my preteen and teen years. ""Forever"" was the book that was passed around (hidden from parents) and read at slumber parties. This book was very disappointing. Does Judy have sex on the brain, or what? Not everyone enjoys reading about sex page after page. I didn't like either one of the characters. I read this book in 24 hours because I wanted to hurry up and finish it. To think I paid hardcover price for this makes me angry! If you want to enjoy the relationship of two ""Summer Sisters"" rent the movie ""Beaches"" - that'll tug at your heartstrings!"
1,Sorry I read it!,I read all of Judy Blume's books when I was young and was VERY disappointed with this Danielle Steel copycat novel. Ms. Blume's young adult novels are touching and beautiful. It's too bad that Ms. Blume cannot bring the same quality writing to her adult novels.
2,I thought this to be a great disappointment.,"Judy Blume was one of my favorite authors growing up. I thought for sure that her adult novels would meet with my approval as well. Unfortunately, I found the constant physicality of her writing somewhat annoying. She has more depth than this as an author - I'm sure of it."
3,"A page turner, but disappointing","My mother discouraged me from reading Judy Blume books when I was a pre-teen, she said they were too trashy. I now understand why-Summer Sisters proclaimed itself shallow, mindless, and raunchy. Still, it was awfully hard to put down! Having read my share of romance novels, I'd say that Blume's new work reads along the same lines. I found myself getting annoyed at all of the characters. Call me a romantic, but try to give us a little hope about life, Judy!"
2,"Story good, writing poor","Summer Sisters was an interesting story, but Blume's writing was so weak that I found myself skimming most of the time. Everything in this book was ""told"" not ""shown"" and after a while, I felt like I was reading a news report."
5,Absolutely fantastic,"I'm a junior in high school, and I'm an avid reader, not to mention difficult to impress. Judy Blume greatly impressed me with *Summer Sisters*. Being from Massachusetts myself and living in Missouri, I could identify with every single summer occurence, and every single detail of their friendship. I grew up reading Blume, and was eager to read this novel. I found it to be a delightful surprise~one of those books you want to read again. It has become one of my all~time favorites. One could argue that, yes, it was a bit sexually explicit in some parts, but that is why it is one of her adult~not childrens~books. It is a novel about more than sex~it's about the friendship of two young girls who became best friends, and grew up together. If you have a best friend, there are so many things to identify with in this novel. I could say so much more, but I don't want to spoil the novel for you. Worth the read, definitely. I'm so glad I have a copy of my own!"
2,Not worth your money.,"I bought this book as soon as I saw it and hurried home to read it from cover to cover. I loved Blume when I was younger and I really wanted to enjoy this book but I found myself laughing to myself too many times and not because it was full of humour. I was laughing at the sheer stupidity of it! Ok, this may seem harsh but please, the storyline went downhill almost straight away and most of the time it was too obvious. I really can't understand why so many people have given this book 4 or 5 stars when it's nothing more than a ""deep"" Mills & Boon story."
2,"As an old die hard fan of JB, this was not that great.","As many of the reviewers here have said, I was a die-hard fan of Judy Blume from age 8 to 11. Her book changed and inspired events in my life, and I would love to meet her and tell her so. With that out of the way, this book had a very boring, unlikable protagonist (poor girl, smart and good), and a cliche antagonist (gorgeous rich-girl best friend), both with not enough substance or backgrounds. I didn't like Vix very much & couldn't understand why Caitlin did. It was hard to be compassionate towards her, she seemed to have the personality of a flea. Other characters, the reader gets a taste of (like Daniel, Gus, Sharkey, Phoebe), but it wasn't enough. Events are rushed through in the end. And characters get more and more sketchy. Read it out of loyalty to Judy, it IS a quick read. But check it out in the library or wait fo r the paperback."
1,Hard to Finish,"I ran across this title in a used book store and picked it up because I always meant to read Judy Blume's adult fiction. Had heard so many good things about her young adult books and, of course, admired her courage for writing realistically for that age group. I hope this is not representative of her other works, because it couldn't have been much worse. It's subtly preachy in a way that's off-putting. Maybe that's a good approach for YA fiction, but it's not appealing for this adult. The message seems to be if you have pre-marital sex you can redeem yourself by conforming and toeing the line. If not, you ruin your life and hurt your friends and family. The writing is oddly juvenile with some sex scattered throughout. The characters don't engage and the story is tiresome. Extremely disappointing."
4,Highly recommended,"This book is definitely a page turner. It is as if you know each of the characters personally and can see a little of yourself in each one of them. As you continue to be drawn into their troubled lives, you can truly empathise with them. A tear might even shed at some particularly sad points in the story. This should be a made into a movie."
3,"Fun, no-brainer...good beach book","Although I gerally perfer to read books with more substance, I still enjoyed this one. It was an easy read and kept me turning the pages. I enjoyed the trials and tribulations of Vix and Caitlin as they grew into womanhood. The book also brought back a lot of memories of my own teenage years. Don't knock this book...sometimes you just want to read a ""light"" book. This one fills that request. Blume has a gift that enables the reader to fully understand her characters. Loved Vix...and at times wanted to strangle Caitlin. Good job, Judy...You were just the thing I needed to take me away."
2,A quick read but disappointing,"After reading the Ya, Ya's and the little altars I was really excited to read this book also about friends and their relationships. But I COULDN'T RELATE to them. I didn't like them very much or sympathize with them at all. I found myself reading it quickly and thoroughly in the hope of becoming connected to the characters as I have before in the before mentioned books. It was disapointing especially after reading the great reviews here at Amazon!!!!!"
4,Great display of the joy and heartache of friendship.,This booked expresses a great display of friendship ..all the joy and heartache that goes along with it. The young adult 'coming of age' experiences are written so well. This book will bring back memories of how naive and curious you were growing up.
4,What a story!,"This was an amazing story that flowed from chapter to chapter so nicely that it was hard to find a stopping place that allowed me to go on about my day without thinking about the next event within the book. This novel kept me interested from the beginning and I only put it down when absolutely necessary (i.e. to use the bathroom, go to work, etc.). This was a story so universal, with such diverse characters that I would be at a loss to find someone who can't relate to at least one of the characters. Blume is a writer who can appeal to people of all backgrounds. This is evident in her ability to write books aimed at both young and old with such elegance, charm and humor. The story was fun and uplifting and I recommend it for anyone who wants to spend a day in a soap opera type fantasy world. Like a soap opera, some of it is very predictable and unbelievable to people living in the real world, one puts its flaws aside to live in a fantasy world of forgiveness and unconditional love."
5,Summer Sisters is a believable and entertaining story.,"Summer Sisters is a wonderful story that stays interesting from beginning to end. The reading flows and moves quickly. The characters were diverse and believable. I love how the reader actually gets into each character's head and knows what they are thinking. The ending is a good conclusion, leaving the reader a little sad but with an easy feeling. This was my first Judy Blume adult novel and I will definately be going back for more."
3,"Riveting, but disturbing","I'm a big fan of Judy Blume and couldn't put this book down, but I was left with very mixed feelings after completing it. I thought Ms. Blume did an exceptional job of exploring the turmoil of adolescent sexuality and the sex scenes are hot and plentiful, which didn't particularly bother me. What I found disturbing was the relationship between the two main characters, which I perceived as unhealthy and abusive. The novel seemed to suggest that the long-term friendship between the girls was valuable enough to excuse Caitlin's behavior, no matter what type of pain or betrayal she dumped on Vix. All in all, I didn't feel that the lessons about friendship contained in this book were healthy, especially not for Blume's teenaged readership. I'm sure quite a few girls will come away from it thinking that Caitlin is 'cool', and that's a little scary."
5,A totally immersing story;the kind of book youcannotputdown!,"Judy Blume is just so easy to read, and Summer Sisters is no exception! This book moves so quickly, and is filled with such realistic dialogue, I believe most people will have a hard time putting it down! The book is about two friends, one beautiful, wild, and outgoing; the other,reserved, conservative,and plain in comparison, who become best friends one summer, and whose lives, forever after, become intertwined. It is a great ""coming of age"" story - filled with emotions and SEX, SEX, SEX! Thoroughly entertaining, yet haunting; I found myself becoming totally immersed in these people's lives! The one problem? I was so disappointed when I finished the book! (And yes - I also believe the book would make a sensational movie; utilizing both a younger and more mature set of actresses, to play the parts of Vix and Caitlin)!"
4,Remember your best friend when growing up?,"If you ever had a best friend while growing up, Judy Blume's Summer Sisters is worth spending an afternoon by the pool to finish this read. Caitlin Sommers is the best friend you always wanted to have but almost knew you couldn't. You'll love her until you hate her, but then discover that she needs your love almost as much as you need to give it--just as her best friend Vix realizes. The relationship between Caitlin and Vix is more than a friendship--it's a common bond of experiences and shared fantasies and dreams--the kind of sharing that takes your insides out--you know this person will always know you, really KNOW you. The best friendship book I've read since Jane Eyre and her Helen Burns."
5,"A happy, touching story of friendship. I loved it",The best book i have ever read. I suggest you and all your friends read it. You wont ever regret it.
2,Entertaining with no real literary value,"I enjoyed all of Judy blume's young adult books when I was younger. Now that I am older (and so are her characters) I have higher standards which this book doesn't necessarily fulfill them. Don't be mistaken, the book is an enjoyable light summer read but I wouldn't expect it to win any awards. A good summer time read if you don't want to think too much"
5,I really couldn't put it down!!,I am 14 and my sister bought this book and i read it when she was done.I absolutely loved it even though it was an adult book.My momwas pissed i read it but its time that sherelized i alraedy knew all the stuff judy wrote about.It was soo could and i could definatley relate to some of the things writtem myself.I think any college or high schooler would love it.
3,Not bad--but not my old Judy!,"I am a huge Judy Blume fan. Even at age 24, I still re-read ""Are you there God..."" and others on occasion. I love Judy's books and have always felt a bond with the characters in her books. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed with this book. I just couldn't relate to Vix or Caitlin. I, too, have a best friend/soul mate who I grow up with. But we don't/didn't share the Power and Ang never treated me like Caitlin treated Vix! I just never felt the real bond between these supposed summer sisters... Aside from the characters, the writing just didn't flow naturally, like Judy's words normal do... At times, I felt like I was reading a bad Danielle Steele book. Overall, I enjoyed this book, but still find her old classics to be much more engaging, enlightening, and realistic. I'll stick to Deenie and Margaret next time I want a Judy Blume fix."
3,Another life-long Judy fan ...,"I am 27 yrs. old, and also grew up loving Judy Blume novels, which I could relate to so well & always found realistic. Though I enjoyed 'Summer Sisters', I found it crossed the line of reality, and took on a very soap opera-esque tone (the date of Cailtlin's wedding??? C'mom!). I also found it disappointing that Blume didn't explore some of Vix's other life experiences in more detail -- i.e. we're told that while at Harvard she had in-depth conversations about the meaning of life with her peers (which all college kids do), yet readers are not privy to them. And though endless conversation was what bonded my personal female friendships -- and still do -- I find the conversations between Vix & Caitlin remain stilted & lack the familiarity that grows between decade-long friends. Sorry, but I preferred 'Forever' & 'Smart Women'."
3,"A ""no brainer"", perfect for the beach.","If your looking for an easy read this is perfect. The characters aren't too uninique, but who wants to think hard in the summer sun. We never learn much about Caitlain which is too bad."
4,This is a great book for me to reflect upon my growing years,"This book was so inticing. I was glued to it until I finished it. The surprise ending was incredible. I wouldn't suggest this book for younger readers. However, I really enjoyed it and look forward to reading more of her novels."
1,Summer Trash,This is one of the worst books that I have ever read. The subject matter included in the book is more suitable for 10 year old girls. But there's no way that I'd let my daughter read this dribble. Please don't waste your money and buy this book.
3,A decent read,"I read the book in one night, while on a business trip. It kept my attention, although parts of the story I found predictable."
3,Excellent take on teenage girls adolescent behavior,"This is the first Judy Blume novel I've read, I'm typically not a fiction reader but found myself picking up ""Summer Sisters"" in the airport one day and found I couldn't get through it fast enough.I felt Judy Blume gave a wonderful description of summertimes spent at Martha's Vineyard. More compelling though was her translation of the relationship that evolved between two young pre-pubescent girls whom at one moment in their lives seem as though they can survive only through the others existence. Yet as in life and as for Caitlin and Victoria they manage to end up on opposite ends of the earth. The journey she takes her readers on through the relationship of Caitlin and Victoria is intimate, compelling, lonley and full of individual discovery. I will recommend it to my neices."
2,Not as I expected.,"This book is suppose to gear towards adult women. As an adult woman, I find this book simplistically written, lacking detail, and poor narration style."
2,Entertaining Summer Fluff,"...It took me about 5 hours to read this book, it is definitelynot challenging, but the main characters are engaging. I think one ofthe greatest appeals of this novel, for me, was the fact that it took place in the years of my own childhood, with characters that were just a few months older than I.If you are looking for an entertaining but simple read for your vacation, this is the book to get."
4,Summer Sisters,"Summers could never be better than spending them with your best friend. Caitlin Somers and Victoria Leonard got to experience this first hand with their annual summer vacations to Martha's Vineyard. This was a very enjoyable book to read which brougt you through the lifes of two best friends. Judy Blume has a unique style of writing that creatively places you right into the center of action. You feel what they feel, laugh and cry with them, and even start to think like they think. Judy Blume wrote this book as if she were with the girls day to day. It was hard to put the book down because I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. Although it was one of the longer books I've read, it only took me about a week and a half to read."
4,"Are You There God, It's Me Victoria?",I found myself captivated by the tale of these two best friends. I was drawn in to the lives of these characters the same way I was drawn into Margaret's life almost twenty years ago.
5,Summer Sisters by Judy Blume,"This book was fabulous! I'm currently reading it for the second time. In Summer Sisters, Judy Blume truthfully captures the summer lives of a responsible girl named Vix and her free-spirited and sometimes destructive friend, Caitlin. This is the first adult book I've read by Judy Blume and I'm really impressed! When you read the book you can definitely identify with the characters and they're life-like enough that you probably know someone just like one of them. This book deserves 5 stars! it's great!"
2,Not a young adult anymore,"I read on the Booklist review that this novel might have been marketed to appeal to Blume's young adult fans from the 70's, now all grown up. As of one those grown-up fans, I agree that the book is a young-adult book masqerading as a book for adults. Blume seems caught in a time warp of teenage mentality. She is a master at telling us what teenagers think and feel, but cannot seem to make the leap to give us similar insights for adults. I will never forget the joy Judy Blume gave me as a young girl, but this book proves once again that you can never go back."
5,A fabulous book for a little summer fun!,I truly enjoyed this book! I read it in two days and could not put it down. I only wish that Judy Blume would write a sequel!
2,What a tremendous waste of time!,"I was surprised and very disappointed that Judy Blume would write such a trashy novel. Her books for kids are so sensitive and heartfelt but ""Summer Sisters"" was utter garbage. The characters were unsympathetic or pathetic or both. Caitlin, especially, was just too self-indulgent to be anything but despicable. It was impossible to relate to or care about Vix or Caitlin. On a positive note, I did find that having the various characters jump in and out with one-page thoughts on events that had just taken place a very interesting way to give a new perspective to the scene. All in all, though, reading ""Summer Sisters"" was a waste of time."
2,good for 12 year olds,"i was obsessed with judy blume's books from the ages of about 10-12, and was curious to see how she was at writing for adults. however, she has not accomplished that with this book. it has shallow, stereotypical characters, minimal plot, and tons of sex scenes which were exciting at age 11, but at 18 are just boring and unnecessary, and sometimes laughable. i gave this book 2 stars because i'm sure i would have loved it 6 years ago... skip it and give it to a younger sister or daughter."
2,Judy's audience grew up but her stories didn't,"This book was advertised as being for adults - I think not. It's about a friendship between two girls coming of age. A book for teens, perhaps, but not grown women. The rags-to-riches luck of Vix & her happy-ever-after was too unrealistic. A fast beach read - if you're in the mood for something light, otherwise buy the book for your teen daughter."
1,beach book,"It's all in the expectations. If you're looking for a cute (but predictable) plot, quick (and unchallenging) read, this is enjoyable. If you're looking for a real book, forget it. This is a dressed-up version of a romance novel."
2,A quick read but ultimately unsatisfying,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I enjoyed Judy Blume books when I was young, so I had great expectations for this one. I was really disappointed. I didn't find any of the characters likeable, or real. The relationship between the female characters was just weird. I don't know of anyone who acted that way with their friends when they were young. Blume is known for her HONEST approach to sexuality; The honesty was lacking. Granted, the older the two characters got, the better portrayed they were. But, overall, it was unrealistic. I couldn't identify with these two characters. The big secret in the plot turned out to be very mundane. I was hoping for something more intriguing."
4,"What a great book, couldn't put it down!","What an interesting story. This book made me laugh, sad, and at the very end the unexpected made me cry. Loved it!"
3,A Trip To Your Own Past...,"I am a 48 year old female whose girls read Blume when they were growing up. I found the book reminisant of my own summers. It feels like a Blume is a ""tattle tale"". Those were secrets, and now everyone knows. I recommend it."
3,Not the 'Judy Blume' caliber I had expected.,"This book was a quick and easy read. It was entertaining enough, but it was not to the same caliber of writing I remembered from Judy Blume. I liked the different view points she wrote from, and it was a good summary of real live events that happened during those 20-some years. However, I felt that the plot was somewhat predictable."
3,It was slow and somewhat depressing. Not what I expected.,I was looking forward to a funny story and was disappointed. The book seemed to have alot of lesbian overtones. The characters never totally developed for me. I found myself reading faster just so I could finish and try to figure out what the point was. Sorry Judy Blume. Normally I'm a real fan of yours.
3,Book Club Choice.....,"This is not a book I would have picked up on my own. But being part of a book club---I was forced into it. It is a very readable book and I finished it in a afternoon, but it left me with nothing. Realize I am a male and have never read a Judy Blume book before. I liked the character of Vix, and could see right away who she would end up with. Caitlin never really suprised me and I never cared for her. Would I reccomend this book to others? Sure, it's an easy read and good for a rainy day...but don't go into it expecting too much."
4,Not literature but a very fine beach book,"I'm new to Judy Blume, whom I've just met--a cute, emotional, very likeable person. This book reads like a junior high novel, yet the plot is gripping. I'd never call the book literature, but novice writers can learn a lot from Judy Blume about how to build a story. (Use the appeal to the shock of recognition--I mean the parts about coming of age about sex--but leave out the gratuitous references to serious matters you don't intend to explore in your book like a brother with birth defects, an unplanned teenage pregnancy, and overdosing on marijuana.) A good read. Linda Donelson, Author of ""Out of Isak Dinesen""(Out of Africa's true story)"
2,Blah...,"I loved Judy Blume's books when I was younger, and I was looking forward to reading one of her adult books. I was very disapointed! Summer Sisters just did not click with me. I couldn't relate to the characters, at any age; and I really did not care what happened to them. It was an easy read, but at the end of it I felt like I had wasted my time. Judy Blume is still a great writer, she just needs to stick to the pre-teen crowd."
2,Somewhat entertaining but dissappointingly predictable,"As a long-standing childhood fan of Judy Blume, I was very dissappointed in Summer Sisters. Character development was lacking and I lost interest in the story at several points during the book. Caitlin's behavior was predictable at every turn and Vix was pathetically manipulated by Caitlin's every move from the beginning. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Could I have BEEN more disappointed?,"I was so psyched when a Judy Blume adult novel came out, I loved her pre-teen books when I was younger. When Summer Sisters finally came out in paperback I bought it and was so disappointed. I don't see the difference between this one and all her teen books. A bunch of teenagers obsessed with sex? I can go watch Dawson's Creek if I want that."
1,Trash reading!,"I was embarrassed tp be seen reading this book. Cat has to be one of the dumbest, masochistic characters ever invented. She lets her best friend use her repeatedly and comes back for more, all the while waxing euphoric over what a great friendship they enjoy. I don't get it."
4,The perfect summer read...,"Its nice to take a break from taxing analysis and intellectualism to truly savour a story of summer friendship. (Haven't we all had summer encounters of some sort?) This was light, quick and yet, complex and unpredictable. Certainly, it is not as thick and textured as a Binchey or Pilcher, but it did leave me wanting more or wondering if is there a chance for a sequel?"
2,Two friends become as close as sisters,"I was excited to read this book thinking it was an adult novel. I am in my thirties and I thought this novel would be ideal for 16-20 year olds. I think late adolescents would enjoy reading about first time sexual relations. But, I needed more. The characters were shallow. Although I did finish the book and did talk about it to others, so Judy did that much for me."
4,"A wonderful novel, and truly heart-warming","Upon buying this book, I pictured Judy Blume and thought I was buying a typical all-ends-well novel. Boy was I wrong! Judy Blume completely blew me away with this wonderful tale of two friends, lost and found once again. I found myself glued to the book, and it truly was hard to put this book down. And every second of reading is worth it in the end. It was simply one of the best books I 've read in a long time!"
5,A simply amazing page turner,"I honestly loved this book and could not put it down. I read it in one day, and i'm not really an avid reader. It pulls you through a torment of emotions and Judy Blume skillfully writes the book in a way that you can actually BE the characters. It could also be a great mother/daughter book because it is suitable for all ages (except under 12, for explicit sex). Teens will love the sexually charged parts to fulfill their raging hormones and adults such as I will love to see the characters muture as we did. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a great time. I would also like to give a shoutout to movie makers because it would make a blockbuster!"
4,Very good book for a mature reader,"This exciting and detailed novel written about two best friends was one book that I enjoyed immensely. I wouldn't recommend this book for children under the age of 12 because some parts are for older people and there are some topics that are inappropriate. This book was recommended to me by a friend who said that it was good. I enjoyed it also. Even though Judy Blume isn't my favorite author, it seemed she spent time on this and I definitely recommend it."
4,Judy Blume- Great as a Children's Author and as an Adult's Author!,"I liked the Fudge books, and I was pleased to find that Judy Blume is equally skilled as a writer for adults. ""Summer Sisters"" was a page turner from beginning to end, and I liked how she made each character contribute their voice to the story.I did find some of the relationships contrived, like Blume felt like she had to include them, but didn't really care about them.At first, I was disappointed by the ending, again, finding it contrived, but then I realized, the whole book was set up for this ending. Nothing could have fit better."
5,One of my all time faves!,I first read this book when I was twelve. I have since read it half a dozen times (I am 26 this year) and I never tire of it. Judy Blume's characters come alive on the page. This book showcases Judy's talent not just as an author but as an adult fiction author. I am re-reading it now and loving every page. A must read.
1,"Summer Garbage,Yuck!","I could have written this worthless, horrible, book. None of the characters were endearing in any way. The story was your usual rich girl, poor girl, dysfunctional family fiasco.I have been reading Judy Blume since I was a little girl and she has grown up into adult novels. This book, however, was her absolute worst. Please try harder next time, Judy!"
3,Loved her as a teenager...,"Judy Blume was my absolute favorite writer when I was under 19 (a dozen or so years ago) and I was thrilled when I saw that she had written what was marketed as an adult novel. However I was less than thrilled after I read it. I think ""light"" in every respect would be the best way to decribe this book. She should go back to writing what she does best: the angst of teenagers. Be it their first love, first boyfriends, all the juicy stuff that teenage girls love to read."
1,Is Blume writing for adults or teenagers?,"I use to read her books when I was in highschool. They were good becuase she knows how to relate to young adults. But, this new adult book called ""Summer Sisters"", was a big disappointment. As I was reading, I kept waiting when will the characters grow-up? Have I bought a book for young adults? Get real! I personally think that she should stick to just writing teenager books because this new book is really intimidating for adults. Yes, Blume may have enchanted teenagers with her writing style but we, adults are not teeny-boppers intriged by words such as ""the power"". Give me a brake! Well, I am happy that she can gear her writing towards the teens but for adults, maybe she needs to grow up a bit and be more of an adult before she puts out her next ""ADULT BOOK"""
1,The biggest waste of my time of any book I have ever read,"I love to read. In my entire life I can't recall reading a book where my I would really like to get a refund, not on the price of the book, but on my time. The story was shallow, the multitude of characters discombobulated, characters with tiny roles would return to the story for no reason. I could have been equally entertained by reading 14 names of strangers with their date of birth, graduation, marriage, divorce, etc. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME"
1,"Been there, read that","I didn't find one original thought, one original character in the whole book. The book is like dozens I've read before and hope to never read again."
3,A good read until the end.,"I remember reading Judy Blume as a kid so I was excited to hear she had a book out for adults. Although, I can see how some people would be disappointed with her ""adult"" writing style I felt the writing was appropriate considering much of the book is about two girls growing up from their teens to mid-twenties. The ending however, was quite disappointing. The author kept me interested for 90% of the book but the ending seemed to come out of nowhere. It was as if she had a deadline to meet and couldn't think of an appropriate ending so she threw in a few twists in an attempt to not be predictable. Instead, her ending was rushed and underdeveloped. It didn't seem to flow with the rest of the book. All in all it was a book with much promise but left much to be desired in the end."
3,"Eh, so so","Okay, this book is not as bad as everyone says. It does have it's fair share of sex in it, but it's not so full of it that it gets annoying. The plot is a little weak, most books at least have a purpose! It starts out a bit dull, but it slowly gets more interesting. It's also a bit strange at parts (like the part about Lamb and The Countess taking baths together, what's up with that? and the whole deal with ""The Power""? I'll tell ya, that's not somethig I did with my best Friend when I was 12!) I won't tell you who Vix ends up with, but I will tell you that it will probably surprose you. Also, I didn't like the ending. It seemed rushed, like Judy just wanted to get it over with. It's a quick and very easy read (probably an 11 year old can read it and understand it , but I definetly wouldn't let your 11 year old read it!) Try just reading it on the beach or something. It's a good way to kill time."
3,"Long on angst, short on substance.","Judy Blume is a consummate teen author, and should not have ventured into adult terrain. The most interesting parts of the book are when the 'sisters"" are teenagers, it becomes trite and dull when they grow up. Although it appears to be a decent length book that is only because of the numerous pages devoted to one-two paragraph musings from some character. Not terrible, and for a lesser author, acceptable. However, Judy Blume is much better than this would have one beleive."
1,WARNING - Reading this book may induce vomiting,"Summer Sisters is a poorly written novel, a waste of time, and an insult to one's intelligence. After getting through half the book, I felt I had to finish it, but the last 50 pages made me regret my decision. The ending is erratic, rushed, and illogical - what a mess! That's the last Judy Blume book I ever read."
1,I was really disappointed,"Before I picked up this book, I had read great things about it, including praises for its sentiment and women-bonding issues. But after I read Summer Sisters, I'm sorry to say that I felt a sick pit in my stomach from the totally unnecessary excess of sexual content and testosterone-laden fantasies. On top of that, the female characters were not strong role models or even women I could relate to - and their bonds together were as weak as their characters.Parents should be aware of the obscenity in this novel before allowing children under 15 to read it. I know the movies kids watch nowadays are horrid, but somehow reading about infidelity and adolescent sexuality through the minds of these characters can leave disturbing visions."
1,I was really disappointed,"I was also amazed to know this book had made the NY Times best seller list. When my daughter was a little girl, we read a lot of Judy Blume's children's books together, I truly enjoyed reading them with her. When I saw that she was writing stories for adults, I quickly grabbed the first one I saw. Big mistake. Abby, Vix and a few others were wonderful characters with depth and personality..... It could have been a good book had Caity been left out. If I had to describe this book in one word, ""Weird"" comes to mind.Stick to children's books, Ms. Blume.... they, are enjoyable reading."
4,Good chick book,"Normally I go for Clancy, Vince Flynn and Nelson DeMille but this is a good, light summer read. Guys shouldn't bother - this is definitely a chick book - but the ladies will enjoy it. I got annoyed by the ending - it was pretty abrupt and you never find out what happened to Caitlin. However, the Somers' were a good portrayal of a rich, eccentric family and Vix's family was dead-on realistic. And sometimes extraordinary girls like Vix do fall for shallow boys like Bru."
4,Wonderful!!,"Well, there was never a dull moment in this book! I thought it was great...Vix and Caitlin were wonderful entertainment! I'm not sure I believe that Vix would continue to be friends with Caitlin after all the awful things she does to her...but who knows. It made for good reading.I was a little annoyed with the ending, (which is why there are only 4 stars here) I like to know exactly what's going on, and have a solid ending to the books I read, I didn't like the big question mark hanging over the end of this book. Overall though it was a really enjoyable read, I couldn't put it down!!!"
2,No better than a trashy Danielle Steele novel,"If you're looking for a Danielle Steele-ish quick read, this is for you. I personally thought it was pure trash. Big disappointment."
3,Summer sisters,I an one of Judy Blume's fan and I really admire her writing talent. I hope that she can publish more books
1,Juvenile porn,"Judy Blume writes for 6th graders. If you were expecting a good ""summer read"", as I was"" you'll be terribly disappointed. Characters are trite; action is non-existant; plot? No, there is no plot. Just a tedious plodding thru a decade or two of ""dear diary"" written by a youngster. Don't waste your time with this book."
3,Who spends that much time with their ankles behind her ears?,"This is typical fluff. Stolen boyfriends with a bit of lesbianism thrown in to boot. (I wonder if the author was trying to tell us that she had had such relationships earlier in her life by dedicating the book to her ""summer sister."")The reading was very light and very easy.I don't think that the experience that people have with ""moth to the flame"" human relationships is quite as dramatic as all that.This is something good to do on a rainy afternon when you don't feel like going out or want to be challenged by overly deep characters and plots of great complexity."
5,"Girls, women, sisters & everyone who wants2 believe in ""NBO""","I gave a copy to my best friend, my sister, my cousin and my other friends--all of them loved it and this is no surprise! Sure, this may not be 'literature' but it's a nostaligc, romantic memoir about two women, Vix and Caitlin, both so different who are both very close until Caitlin comes up with a manipulative ploy which has Vix wondering just who is this girl? Fast forward eight years and Caitlin is marrying Vix's 'man'...what's with this? Sad, funny and poignant, i enjoyed this book immensely."
5,A Treasure To Read.,"I just finish reading the book, and it was enchanting. It has you wondering to very end it makes you feel like somewhere in your life that you have the met the situation with someone who you knew or maybe it happen to you.Summer sisters is about two best friends who are childhood friends. One who has everything and takes it for granted and one who which she had everything doesn't take everything for garnted. When Victoria is suprise and eleated that Caitlin wants to be her friend.Victoria and Caitlin go through a lot. Vix wants more out of her life, and when she gets that chance to go to a Ivy League school she takes it. Caitlin on the other hand goes exploring around the whole, and ends becoming someone she knows that she already destined to be.But Caitlin is keeping from Vix the one thing that puts their friendship to the test. Caitlin and Vix well always be summer sisters."
3,GRAPHIC. very graphic,"After years of writing children's books, Judy Blume has released all that sexual tension into one book. The book is a fairly quick read, but there are more than a few sections that leave you wondering, did I really need to know that?"
1,Wasted Time Reading About Wasted Lives,"I hate when I read a book that left me with nothing and I ask, ""Why did I bother reading this?"" This book is about two girls who escape their real lives. One escapes a so-so family life for an ""adopted"" family and one escapes her more stable family to waste herself in hot pursuit of excitement and men. No one seems to deal with what they have been dealt with in life, but look for substitutes. It is written from an immature teen perspective and no one seems to actually grow up even though they age in years. The sex began with the two young girls doing it with each other and then basically doing it with anyone else as they grew older. There were also too many characters to keep up with and I grew tired of trying to remember why someone was important to the story. I am disgusted that I let these characters occupy a part of my life."
4,Don't let 9th graders read this one,"I found this book in the 9th grade. My teacher then had it on her shelf for students to read. NOT A GOOD IDEA. Since I was a rebel child, I read it and instantly fell in love with it. It took me about two days to read. Summer Sisters is full of naughty things. I recommended it to my best friend and she fell in love with it also. It is an easy read and quite entertaining. A great airplane read.I've read it about every year since then to get my yearly dosage of of a Romance novel."
2,NOT a good book!,"The characters were so underdeveloped, and the plotline was unbelievable in several places. How did Caitlin make it to Harvard? Unless she was unbelievably intelligent (which was never brought out or mentioned), I doubt this would've happened. Also, some details were simply not correct -- for instance, Victoria's Secret had not even become a store yet in the early 80's, much less started putting out a catalog! The story seemed obsessed with sex, and I just got tired of it."
2,These characters are difficult to like!,I struggled with this book. I found most of the characters to be so shallow and selfish that I really didn't care if I finished the book or not.
2,not worth it,"This book went really fast when I read it but I really don't reccomend it. It's pretty boring, the characters cliche and tiring. I expected so much more from Blume."
3,This is Adult Fiction?,"I read Judy Blume when I was young and thought I would give her adult fiction a try. Unfortunately, it felt like I was reading a Harlequin Romance and not something I would call good fiction. However, I liked the two main characters, Victoria and Caitlin, although I couldn't always understand where their emotions were coming from, especially at the end. I also think that the other characters' viewpoints were not needed and did not add anything to the book that the reader could not already know and appreciate. I hope that Blume sticks to children's fiction in the future, because that's what she's best at."
5,"Wonderful To Read, it sucks you in and won't let you go!","I really loved this book. It was one of those that you could not put down. I would recomend this book to ANYONE that does not like to read and those of us who do. I think that it would get people to read again. I have always LOVED Judy Blume and now that I know that she writes adult books, I am going to read all of them! IT was a EXCELLENT book! I want to go to an Island now!!!"
3,Clear understanding on American youngster mind and mood,Excellent..The American people are very different from the Chinese. I think the book serves a good job in reflecting the minds and moods of the American youngsters. A definite page turner. Judy Blume is skilful enough to mesmerize the readers by drifting the change of the relationship of the Summer Sisters is the central story line.
5,This Book is a Teen's Dream,"This book I've read over and over I just can't get enough. This story is one in a million. In this book friendship is key. There Are two friends who would do anything for each other. If you liked the movie "" Beaches "" you'll just love this book."
1,I felt disappointed in Judy Blume,"Traffic in Fairfax County, Virginia, is so terrible, that I began to take the bus to work. Having had my fill of technical literature that I print from the Internet, I decided to purchase a ""bus book"". I had read Judy Blume's elementary school tales and enjoyed them. While I finished ""Summer Sisters"" in two days, I can't believe I actually read it. I'd have to place the book near Harold Robbins' works or ""Mandigo"". I may as well help my twelve-year-old work on dichotomous keys for his science class. I'd really rate the book a black dot and ask for my time back."
5,Growing Up,"This book has, and always will be, one of my all-time favorites! For any woman who has expirienced the ups and downs of growing up female and just trying to find your place in this world. I adored both Vix and Caitlin and found myself struggling to choose which one I identified with. Am I the smart and serious Vix or the spontaneous care-free Caitlin? I finally realized that parts of both of them are inside of me as most of us have found from time to time. From their first sexual encounters to picking husbands, Vix and Caitlin take you along with them as they venture through life. This book is not supposed to have a plot or a real climax. It is realistic story about friendship, love, and growing up. A must-read for anyone who has been blessed to know the true ups and downs of friendship....and in the end, the importance of sisterhood."
1,Bad even for summer reading!,"Interesting that many readers' criteria for a good read is how quickly one can get through a book. This was absolutely terrible -- from the sex to the money to the dingleberries -- trash! Kills me that I saw copies on a rack for summer reading displayed with books by Anne Tyler, Jane Smiley, and Joanna Trollope, as though all things are equal!"
1,Summer Sisters,"This is a post written by someone who adores Judy Blume and has read all her children's and teen novels. Having read her other books, I was really expecting a novel with actual substance, rather than just fluff fiction. The strange twisty drama I got was nowhere near my expectations. It seemed so juvenile for such a prolific writer, and this was supposed to be an adult novel! It was filled with...oh, for lack of a better phrase, trashy drama. The fact that it was slow paced and pretty dull, teeming with pointless filler, did not make a stronger case for this novel. Not to mention, whoever wrote the summary on the back of the book pretty obviously never bothered to actually read the book, so details on the ending were revealed before I even opened the book, and some of the material from the back summary never even occurred. Just do yourself a favor and stick with her more substantial teen books.Rating: 1/5"
5,A+++++++!!!!!!!,"I loved this book! I think it's by far one of my favorites. It has a wonderful way of making you reminisce on your own life, your own friends. J.B. did a superb job! There were parts where I thought ""been there! know that feeling!"" I enjoyed the point of view that the book was told in, but what I enjoyed most was how you also got the point of view of all characters - how it'd let you know just what they were thinking & how they viewed the situation. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT BOOK!!!! Can't wait for more adult novels by J.B. FANTASTIC!!!!!"
3,A Good Beach Read,"This was my first book by Judy Blume. My daughter has read several of her books and has liked them all. I really liked her style of writing in this book; often describing various events from different characters points of view. I really enjoyed the relationship between the two main characters, Vix and Caitlin, but as they grew older, it was hard to believe that one person could put up with so much anguish from her supposed best friend. The ending was disappointing for me; I was hoping for more."
4,Definitely a worthwhile read,"It was not exactly what I expected, but I couldn't put it down. It was racy and fun. Sometimes putting 2 and 2 together was more challenging than others, but that kept it from being boring. Some of the antics of the teens were quite easy to relate to. The others were fun to imagine."
5,"Made me wish I had a ""Summer Sister""","It took me four days to read this masterpiece. I have been a fan of Judy Blume since her ""Freckle Juice"" and ""Superfudge"" days. Having grown from a child to a woman with the help of her books on my night stand I must say that this book was an abolute joy and a thrill to read. The characters were multi-dimensional and you could really feel for them. Having not gone on a summer vacation this year reading this book certainly sent me on one all over the world. From Marhta's Vineyard, to NYC, and Europe the characters and the language of the book kept my interest. I look forward to Judy Blume's next adult novel. Everyone who has had a best friend that they would do anything for should read this book. I am definately giving it to my best friend!"
3,It was good and bad,i liked this book because you never really get bored. I never wanted to put it down. But when I was finally finished I wanted more. I just didn't see the purpose in it. Being 12 myself I couldn't relate to these girls who are around my age for the beginning of the book. Like I said before I just couldn't find a purpose
4,Sad that it had to end!,"This book was great, definitely one of the best I've read. It kept me laughing out loud, crying, and upset. This is a fun book that doesn't require much thought to read, and should be read by all best friends. The only thing I would have changed about this book is the fact that it ended. I couldn't wait to turn the page until the end, where I read slowly in an attempt to read it as long as possible! I loved it!"
2,Easy read a dissapointment,"Ive read Judy Blume growing up and was anxious to see how she came across to the adult readers. Frankly, i was disappointed. And to think i actually paid money for this book. There were way to many random referenced to sex and situations that were just so unlikely. I couldnt relate to the characters and the ending was quite predictable."
2,"Still Room For Improvement, Wake-Up!","For some reason there remains a problem with the video quality of Thomas Crown Affair. What we are suppose to be seeing is a new transfer, ( I guess admitting that the prior version needed improvement) which in fact it did. This new transfer isn't quite what I was expecting, in fact it's uneven or should I say unbalanced which gives a uncomfortable viewing experience. Anyone who purchases this DVD version expecting the ultimate quality version is in for a big let-down. This DVD is offered with the wide screen/ full screen format. MGM appears to be looking in the rear view mirror. With Plasma/LCD quality, why is MGM wasting time with marginal quality standards. This Batch will end up in the bargin bin. Save your money and wait till next time."
4,Great 60's caper!,"Fun, Colorful, glamorous, cool ... a little dated yes.... but if those fashion/action/montages so popular in 60's and 70's films are out ... why did they invent MTV! This move is cool, period. Characters are chilly and calculating, but fun. Who wouldn't like to be that cunning. McQueen is the epitome of minimal, Dunaway (as always) is both gorgeous and amazing. One of the last real screen divas ... she can go from the most subtle of subtle to soooo over the top! A must have for film buffs."
3,Harmless fluff.,"I didn't see this when if first came out, so perhaps I'm unfairly comparing it to the remake, which I thought was very well done and interesting.Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway are two of my favorite actors. They were both terrifically talented people, but I don't think they are at their best in this film. They are nice to look at, but the script doesn't give them much to work with. The chess scene is very good, until they start smooching, when the soundtrack and choreography go out of control.The soundtrack is beautiful on its own, but is too intrusive during the film.It's a fluffy film with a thin plot, but it's fun to watch, if only to see McQueen and Dunaway in their prime."
5,The Thoimas Crown Affair,"I like the original ""Thopmas Crown Affair"" over the remake - Both films are entertaining, but the original is believable."
5,There is only one Thomas Crown and that's Steve McQueen.,"Watching Norman Jewison's Thomas Crown Affair makes anyone wonder why a remake would be necessary. Thirty years later this film still holds up well compared to many of the newer crime dramas. Steve McQueen's versatility as an actor radiates in this film, it's still amazing that he wasn't even considered for the role. After pleading for a chance to Norman Jewison he won the part and silenced many of his critics. With a great supporting cast, especially Faye Dunaway as the cunning Miss Vicki one wonders why anyone would want to be part of a remake. This is a very tough act to follow. Before you see the remake watch the original then compare. Nothing against Pierce Brosnan but stick to 007, you're no Steve McQueen."
3,got cool? get some,"The dvd audio and video are excellent.This is a memorable film , not a great one.This is a film of my youth , as such it is part of my anti aging therapy.Possibly Mc Queen's coolest performance.I watched it several times as soon as I received it,and will continue to watch it,it is worth watching."
3,The Original,"Very stylish presentation & great outfits on Faye. However, there is little chemistry -- Steve's character isn't especially seductive. Also, he does not physically involve himself with the crime. See the remake."
1,"Awful, awful, awful","After seeing the terrific Brosnan-Russo remake, I wanted to see the original, since they are always supposed to be better. This has to one of the most idiotic movies ever made. It's not only that it's dated but the story makes no sense. That Dunaway looks at some pictures of men who've gone to Europe recently and picks out McQueen as the robber--can we really believe that? And with no evidence, nothing to tie him to the crime, McQueen goes along with it and returns the money. Because some dumb blond tells him he's guilty? Duh! This was even too dumb for the swinging 60s. I can't understand how people rave about this dumb movie. It lacks any real plot or suspense, and the chemistry between Dunaway and McQueen is about as enticing as two dead fish meeting."
2,Watch the first and last 15 minutes for the movie!,"I was really into this film right from the start. The first 15 minutes film, I forgot I was watching Thomas Crown and thought I was in the middle of a James Bond flick! But after the initial beginning, there was a BIG letdown and the story simmers into a tireless love story that seems like a ripoff from ENTRAPMENT! The last fifteen minutes of the film were first rate so if you get this DVD, watch the beginning and then skip to the end. Believe me the middle is something you can forget about."
1,Bad transfer - part of movie missing,The Amazon on-line rental version of this movie is cut off on the bottom -- about 25% of the bottom is missing throughout the entire picture.
5,McQUEEN,ONE OF STEVES BEST MOVIES HE WAS MAGNIFICENT TOO BAD HE DIED SO ERLY HE WAS SOME POWERFULAND GOOD
5,The Thomas Crown Affair,I loved this movie the first time I saw it when it was first released. I still love it!
1,The Thomas Crown Affair,The Thomas Crown Affair movie 1968Wrong item shipped - who is in charge? I don't think it was me.
3,A slick flick that gets better and better,"I must admit I wasn't expecting much from this movie. But, once again Steve leaves you stunned. He slips in and out of the picture before you know he's there. Faye Dunaway does a great job as the dective out to catch the thief. The movie opens with a classic bank robbery. From there on the plot thickens. No matter what Dunaway tries, steve maneges to outrank her. And, the cat and mouse game continues. But, will steve get away with his little scheme, or will Faye convince him to turn himself in. I wont tell you the ending, but I can say that it will leave you satisfied. Its no wonder they got P.B. to do the remake. This film definitly deserves a second run. The Thomas Crown affair is fun, and slick entertainment. That is if you can understand what they're saying. But, never the less, you shouldn't miss this one."
5,Perfect Role For McQueen,"McQueen is magnetic and brilliant. Never has the screen seen an actor who says so much without saying a thing. No, I haven't seen the remake and...frankly, I don't want to. McQueen makes the antisocial Crown his own. Quality entertainment folks!"
2,"great movie,but PLEASE avoid this copy.","an all-time great movie and one of my favorites.McQueen at his best.Excellent film work,acting et al.the problem with this item is the item itself.dvd comes in a ""slim"" case (not a standard dvd case)and plays like an illegal bootleg and not the licensced copy that I paid for.this was shipped amazonprime but is not an amazon product.I would avoid that merchant by all means! The picture quality is good only and the audio quality is so poor that even at max volume on my television, I could hardly hear the dialogue.one of the few total disappointments I have encountered with amazon."
4,I watched this after the remake... It's good but the remake is better!,I enjoyed this film but the remake I enjoyed MUCH MUCH more. Interesting that they found a way to include Faye Dunaway in both films - but in different roles. Worth seeing... I'm glad I own both.
3,classic,"classic film, perhaps I should have purchased a new not a used dvd, some imperfections, but you get what you pay for."
2,The remake improves on the original,"This is a case where viewing the original after the remake is a mistake. I have seen the remake with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo several times and have enjoyed it each time. In watching original I was disappointed on many levels. The acting by all involved is forced. The soundtrack is like many from 60's movies, loud and annoying."
4,Good Tunes,"Lots of spacey melodic things happening, but a fair bit of guitar bite to it too. Great lyrics, good voice in an alternative rock kind of way. Hit potential: More, It Begins, Learning To Forgive, Victim. Weird potential: Grape Jelly. Is that a goof on us all, a cosmic joke? Reading the lyrics one gets that Grape Jelly is Pat telling us he doesn't really put much faith in the whole rock and roll machine. Hey, maybe that's not a bad attitude given the generalized mass garbage we're poked with in today's music world. Still, I wonder how many people will get it."
2,Missing pieces,"The product is fine except the description states that there are 2 each of the cutters 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. I only got one of each cutter but both handles."
4,good for carving pumpkins,"I used these for intricut details carving pumpkins. They are not at all appropriate for children to use because they are essentially exacto knives. The sizes and shapes are neat, takes some experimenting to master. The blades all fit into the holder."
1,Not the size stated,"Advertised as 10 x 10 x 2.4 inches, but they are not. I ordered four and they are 'all' about 10"" x 6"" x 2"".So if you are OK with the 10"" x 6"" for the price then I would recommend it."
5,Fantastic & Inspirational,"I have read this book twice now and have told many of my friends about it. If you or someone you know is battling with alcoholism I highly recommend this book. The stories vary from person to person, and it's interesting to read all the different stories. If someone thinks they might have a problem with alcohol, this book will certainly shed some light on whether they may need more help with their problem. The book is inspirational, heart-wrenching and stories of the individuals are courageous. There is help, and you're not alone. Change is possible."
1,"This work is the work of the enemy, flee from what it says at all costs!","This author has no ability to distinguish truth from fiction. As a doctorate level philosopher and an ardent student of the Truth, I can tell you that this author is not able to discern truth from fiction. This book is a mistake in thought, and is written by someone who is captive to the flesh and not familiar with the kingdom, or thoughts, of God."
4,good for one song,I got this CD because of one song I always liked.Track 18) Home for the Holidays by Robert Goulet. The outside removable jacket is incorrectly labeled.It show track 18) Home for the Holidays by John Davidison.I must say this was much cheaper to get this CD.I thought about getting the Robert Goulet Holiday CD on Amazon which was much much more.I just wanted this one song.So I got a bargain.
1,"Mabis blood pressure monitor, didn't work...!","I tried following the ""brief"" images/instructions on the 04-180-006, and never could get this working?I called their ""clueless"" CS three times, to no avail!I was following instructions correctly, but no matter how high you initially pump it up (Recommended 50-60 past normal!- OUCH!) it always gave me a VERY SLOW de-pressure ""EE"" (error code)!~~~~It's going back, and I'm going to Wally World next?-I got a ""fully"" automatic Omron (auto-pumps up with much less initial pressure/fast/dual-power/memory/...!), and it's well worth the couple of extra bucks! Will probably make it up in battery savings over it's lifetime!?"
5,Everything I've tried in this (lots) is A PLUS PLUS.,"Whenever I want to astound someone with food that is uniquely superb I reach for this book. My husband and I rate all recipes that we try and only the ones that get an A plus get repeated. All that we've tried in this book are A plus. A little bit of work required for most, actually a lot, but well worth it."
5,Best of Hip Hop Album in a Long Time,"After listening to this cd I was totally amazed. Little T brings true hip hop back with the cd. The music on the whole cd is perfect. There are a couple of songs that are not very good but the other songs make up for it. Best songs on this cd are Fome is Dape, Immune, J, Guidance Counselor, and Deadman. I read other people comparing him with Eminem(which I hate) and they are totally different artists with totally different ideas. Eminem is just about yelling and screaming and killing his wife while Little T is about funny songs, clever lyrics, and what rap music should really be about. If you like Bloodhound Gang you will love this cd. GET IT NOW."
5,great album,"Most people got a hold of this after hearin the shaniqua track but don't even consider sleepin on the rest of the album. The album in a few words is really well produced, has creative lyrics, and definitely maintains a genuine hip hop influence. If your hungry for some hidden gems look no further."
2,Leave them alone,Man the other peeps on this page is harsh shaniqua is a sweet song.Most of the other songs is wack dough
1,This Slbum Aucks!,"First of all, in order to have any credibility, Little T needs to change his name to ""Lil' T."" Being articulate gets you nowhere on the street, where i'm sure Little spends much of his time, ""hanging out"" and ""pretending to be a pot-head."" The antiquated use of the phrase ""shut up, Beavis"" is also most distressing. Young T compounds his offenses against taste with each track, delving deeper and deeper into the nether regions of wackness. He reveals to the listener the raw passion and angst that can only be developed through a long, hard adolesence of video games and talking about, but not actually getting, laid. I'm sure that not ALL of his boasting is false though. For example, he probably actually HAS consumed beer before, i'll give him that much credit. Did i mention his lack of anything resembling lyrical skill? He's like the suburbs' answer for Nate Dogg. Thank God this is Little T's last album."
2,Barbara Streisand - The Concert,Wonderful to see and hear B. Streisand live in concert.Rate: *******
1,Ultimate Barbra,"This is ""Barbra-In-Your-Face"". This is what she does best... oversinging, pious, and self-centered productions. Two CDs worth of all the Barbra you ever wanted."
1,"""Don't""","At least you're spared looking at that tacky set she used in this tour. The endless yowling in the endless medley from her 1984 flop ""Yentl"" blew out my speaker."
4,Need Another,"I loaned this book, and I haven't received it back. This means the person enjoyed it so much he decided to keep it or he lost it out of disinterest. These brothers were previously reared in the Islamic faith. They converted to Christianity. Interesting comments, but I wasn't completely enthralled with the book."
4,By any means necessary,"I discusse this book with my wife. She asked me how were the Democrats ever able to get away with this stuff. The allegations in the book are so well documented with an exceptional attention to detail that can become, after a while a little burdensome. I however, thoroughly enjoyed it. The completeness of the text while weighing it down adds credibility. If the Clinton/Gore/Reno administration does not open your eyes to the Plato quote ""the masses are incurably ignorant"", then we deserve what we get."
4,No Shame.,I am knocking off one star because I probably knew most of this stuff already. What a page-turner. It didn't help my mental condition that I was reading it the same week as the trade center disaster. I am sure the policies of the Bill-Hill-Al-Janet administration provided our country's enemies with the assurance that we are a nation of wimps and will tolerate just about anything. No national outcry was heard regarding the incinerated babies at Waco and never any outrage over the bombing of innocent civilians. Not to mention the 8-year policy of trashing any person who didn't agree with you. Remember that Monica was first portrayed as a stalker. Lucky for her she saved the blue dress. Now if I can just get my left-wing friends and relatives to read this book.
3,Devil's Advocate Enters the Fray,"Greetings and Salutations!Well, as a die-hard independent I couldn't help but agree, question, reject and laugh at various parts of this work.Don't let anyone tell you otherwise: this is NOT an impartial or impersonal book. It is clearly biased to a conservative point of view. On the other hand, there is clearly the taste of truth scattered throughout. The problem is that it's sometimes hard to find.I think the clearest statement I can make is this: The Liberals thinks this is an evil, slanderous book while the Conservatives believe this is a truthful, insightful tome. People believe what they want to believe, and this book is certainly not good enough (or bad enough) to change anyone's mind.Cheers!"
5,David Limbaugh is a big fat genius!!!!,"It's true man! He knows where it's at man. The far-left thought police and their fornicating headmasters have held American values in their sway too long man! It's time for a real man to step up to the plate and take a long, hard, deep swing. David Limbaugh is all that and a bag of chips. And you liberals know it! Yeah!"
2,Surface treatment with no new insights. Very disappointed.,"I was really interested in this book, expecting to get some real information about what happened inside the Department of Justice. There is very little new information to be found. The book is a compendium of scandals that could have been written by anyone who closely followed the Clinton administration. There is no real reporting here, particularly about the inside workings of the DOJ. You might want to save your money."
4,Exceptionally Researched but a Little Dry,David spares no detail in this fine piece of work. Add this selection to the growing list of jaw dropping books on the subject of the Clinton machine.As I stated in my title I thought the reading was a little dry much of the book reads like a court report. I guess I was expecting some sharp-tongued humor that would be expected from David's talk radio conservative icon brother Rush.If you are intrigued as I am with the issues surrounding the way Clinton abused his powers for political ends or personal gain then this is a must read. If you are looking for Limbaugh wit you will have to look to Rush.
3,"Predictable, Assumptive",Knowing Limbaugh's leanings one can predict much of the content of this book. Nice catalogue of the issues with the Clinton Justice Department but much of it is interpreted in a knee-jerk conservative fashion. I can say this as a third generation southern red neck conservative. In my experience conservatives like to throw stones for unscrupulous politics but they handle their own folks with kid gloves. This book is lots of rock tossing and not enough critical thinking.
1,Complete crap,"This is just more of the same tireless, brainless garbage spouted off by the extremist, right-wing wackos that want to turn our country back into a racist, laissez-faire exploitation machine. These people are not only nuts, they're pathetic. These aren't nice people, they're sick, and this book contains little factual data to support its premise."
1,give me a break,This book did not have one bit of new information. I was looking for some inside informaion from Rush Limbaugh brother. All I got was old TV and newspaper info. Give me a break!
2,Save your money.,"What a waste of time. I am no defender of Bubba, but it does seem ironic that his enemies ( like Mr. Limbaugh) need him more than ever to keep their fleeting few minutes of fame alive. They should be thanking him instead of bashing him as his ridiculous behavior has prolonged the careers of otherwise forgotten 'writers'."
4,Gertie Lawrence and the performance of her career!,"LADY IN THE DARK is one of the seminal Broadway works of the 1940's. Providing Gertrude Lawrence with her biggest Stateside success, and also featuring talented up-and-comer Danny Kaye, the show would run for close to 500 performances. The story concerns the outwardly-confident yet inwardly-troubled Liza Elliott as she subjects herself to sessions of psycho-analysis, in order to understand and overcome her reluctance to commit to her fiancee.The score by Kurt Weill and Ira Gershwin is both lush and gritty, full of juicy character numbers like ""One Life to Live"", ""The Princess of Pure Delight"", ""My Ship"" and the showstopping ""Saga of Jenny"". This recording features all the main numbers performed by original stars Lawrence and Kaye. Added as a bonus are Danny Kaye's renditions of some of Lawrence's songs; as well as Hildegarde's version of ""The Saga of Jenny""."
1,Dull And Boring,"I read westerns now for over 35 years, travel the west on a regular basis and write historical articles every now and then. I read this book recently on a transatlantic flight from Munich to Atlanta, well, you don't have to eat noodles on a flight to fall asleep you can also read this book. A dull addition of known names and a dragging plot."
3,"On ""On Liberty...""","Don't get me wrong. This book is quaint and it certainly has its merits. However, I was disappointed that the character on the cover isn't featured anywhere within. Who is the man with outsretched arms? Is he pleading for alms? Is he offering to pull someone out of a river? In fact, if you look closely he appears to be standing in a body of water which could support the latter theory. Who is he pulling from the river? Or is this a metaphor... do these essays figuratively pull one out of the river - the river of intellectual darkness? Perhaps not, which brings me back to my original point. Who is this man? Like all great philosophical questions... we may never know."
4,Fun reading. Great stories of frontier Wyoming.,"Great snapshot of stories of Wyoming's early days and the ""entertainment"" available to the cowboys and the trouble they got into when they were entertaining. It appears that a lot of research had to be done to find out the details and stories to put into this writing. Fun reading.."
5,Wonderful photographic illustration of modeling,"This is a book that shows you, via numerous photographs, how a clay sculpture is actually made. The book starts with detailed photographs of different types of sculpture that whet your excitement. It then moves to defining the tools and supplies that are going to used in the rest of the book. The greatest part of the book is the detailed step by step photographic illustration of what happens during each part of building the sculpture. It is really exciting to see how the model is transformed between its various stages. I learned more from this one book than 2 adult- evening sculpture classes(that cost $300+)from the local Art college. This book is worth the investment!"
1,Only the Basics.,"While Mr. Lucchesi is obviously a very talented sculpter of the human physique,I found this book to be somewhat simplistic in it's approach. Going through its pages was similar to watching the how-to-paint shows on PBS,a few little tricks here and there to get a quick effect,but no real exploration as to what makes a sculpture a real work of art or a true portrait. For someone who already posseses an understanding of anatomy,who knows the foundation of modeling the head,this book describes not much more than forming a maniken. There is no discussion of the relationships between parts of the face or how those relations change with different emotions. I can only recommend this book to beginners with no previous modeling experience."
2,Not For the Beginner...or the Advanced?,"For a beginning sculptor, Lucchesi leaves a lot of steps out, the gaps are difficult to overcome for the starter. I also found that it was difficult to apply the techniques when trying to create an actual likeness.....much of Lucchesi's work appears to be very similar in shape and form."
5,Modeling the head in clay,This is a fabulous book. I have studied it and it is one of my favorite books on working clay.This is a must for your library for clay art.
5,Face 101,The best book on the perspective of the human face for someone who wants to create expressive anatomically correct faces in any media. Well worth the bucks.
4,Gift for my uncle,I bought this as a gift for my retired uncle who has recently taken up sculpting. He loved it!
5,Excellent resource,"An excellent learning tool for the amatuer or professional. Illustrated with many photographs of the processess, as well as finished work, this book is both instructional and motivational."
1,Jamaican National Country Flag-Excellent Deal.,I received the Jamaican flag in just a few days after ordering it. It is way bigger than I imagined it would be. For the price of $4.49 it is a steal. It isproudly hung in my bedroom reminding me of my wonderful trips to Jamaica.
5,excellent reference,excellent source for anyone looking to be and organized and successful Executive Director. Works for any field.
1,doesn't receved !,i order it before more than month ago and it's not arrived to me yet !!this is bad company they not answer my emails and emaili sent to them more than one email and they didn't answering me !
2,Why?,Alright product. But 3D doesn't do a thing for the movie. Even the scissors scene doesn't work any better. I guess Hitchcock thought that we ought to see Grace in full 3D?
4,Leave Your Brain At The door,"This Hitchcock has always intriged me for several reasons. The way He fit all the pieces of this complex mystery so perfectly in place IS kind of hillarious, however, the aspect of this film that most overlook is the rich, luscious color! Look closely at the texture of of the hues! This puppy is a beauty!"
4,"Lots of Twists and Turns, But Slow in Parts","I recently viewed this movie for the first time. I thought the film was brilliantly acted and I loved the various twists and turns that the plot took. Very few of the plot turns were predictable at all, but they did shot just how extemporaneous Tony (the husband of Grace Kelly's character) could be in his plans. My only complaint was that the movie did seem to take a long time to get where it finally got (well over two hours). Some of the dialogue seemed far too long, but the fact that the plot kept taking its various turns makes up for this."
5,fantastic suspense from The Master,"first off, i am a huge Hitchcock fan, but even non fans will find this movie suspensful and very fun to watch. the lead roles are played beautifully by milland and kelly. hitch's trademark of letting us, the viewer, in on the important plot point, while the characters have no idea what is going on, creates a lot of tension.a must see for any movie fan, as i would imagine any fan of The Master has already seen this one."
5,Finally!,"I've been waiting for ""Dial M for Murder"" to be release on 3D Blu-ray or for that matter any classic 3D film. It's a good film, although not one of Hitchcock's best, but even mediocre Hitchcock is better than almost anything most director's put out. the word is that ""Dial M"" is a better film in 3D. I can believe that; look at Avatar which looks mediocre in 2D but sensational in 3D. I'm hearing that ""Dial M"" will look better on Blu-ray than it ever has looked. Hope this one's followed by ""Kiss Me Kate"" and ""House of Wax"". Can't wait."
5,"""Dial M For Murder""[Blu-Ray 3D]","I had been waiting for the 3D release of this classic 1954 Alfred Hitchcock thriller for such a very long time,and now,finally,here it is in it's ORIGINAL 3D FORMAT at last! It was very long overdue and very highly anticipated and it does not disappoint! The 3D effect is most definitely always there and very much present in every scene,the quality of the Video/Audio transfer is SUPERB,it looks and sounds like a brand-new movie.I am beyond words! The set also includes the standard,regular,flat,2D presentation of the film,but not much else in the way of extra bonus features,which is the ONLY thing that goes against this fine first-rate Blu-Ray release,but,all in all,I still very much recommend it."
5,Great movie,"Hitchcock and 3D -- what more could you ask for??? Dial M for Murder is #4 on my list of Hitchcock's 5 best movies -- it's got more talk and less action than other movies, but it's very well acted and has a good plot with a twist or two. It was originally filmed in 3D, but, as I understand it, was never released in 3D. The 3D version adds some depth and enjoyment, although the 3D wasn't nearly as advanced as it is today. Still, for 3D fans, as I am, I do recommend the 3D version."
5,Dial M For Magnificient,"Hitchcock's only 3D movie and one of the top 5 3D movies of all time finally gets a stateside release. For anyone who suffered for years with faded copies of the Japanese VHD disc with the subtitles, this is the reward for our patience. Beautiful picture quality. I noticed no ghosting on my Vizio passive 3D TV. Oh, and for those who claim this wasn't a widescreen release, you'd be wrong. It actually was released in 1:85 originally and this is the first home release to present the movie every way it was intended to be seen.Get it today."
5,Hitchcock in 3-D.,"Due to the state of the art restoration and the 3-D process, this film is almost like watching a play (which the movie is based on). I haven't watched in 2-D yet, but the 3-D version is worth the price of the disc."
3,3-D correction,"The review by David R. Von Pein was very helpful, but a correction is in order. The 3-D projection at the time of the release never required the audience to wear cheesy cardboard anaglyph (red/green lensed) glasses. The glasses were sometimes cardboard and sometimes plastic but they had polarized lenses which produced no color distortion whatsoever.To my mind, it is a very great pity that this release does not include a field-sequential 3-D version. Field sequential 3-D glasses such as the ones used at IMAX theatres are readily available for home use for under $100. How nice it would've been to see the film in glorious 3-D as intended!"
3,"Okay movie, okay 3D","I guess I am just not a big Hitchcock fan. I can't think of a single one of his movies that I LOVE - they are all just okay to me. This movie falls into those lines - and the movie, while pretty good the first time through, doesn't hold up on repeated viewings. It's just an okay movie to me.Much like many movies nowdays, Hitchcock was forced to film the movie in 3D, much to his dismay.(source: [...])Now as the movie was shot natively in 3D, the 3D effects are fantastic - its just that the movie doesn't really have much to take advantage of the technology. It's like Hitchcock had the entire movie planned out, and the first day he went to film, they gave him a 3D camera, and he really didn't bother to change how he was going to shoot the movie.If you are a fan of the movie, pick it up. It looks pretty good. If you have never seen it, you may want to pass over it as a blind-buy."
3,Finally to see a old movie in B-3D format,"5 stars only for the effort of putting old 3D movie in B-3D format. 2 stars for the story of this movie-- not my type of movie because of ""stage play"" format and talks too much. I bought this because it appears to be the first B-3D disc with old 3D movie."
3,It Was Okay,"Dial M for Murder was an okay movie, but not the best Alfred Hitchcock movie. I thought that the plot was very creative, and the actors were wonderful. But, it kind of got boring in a couple of parts. But it's still a pretty good movie."
3,DIAL 'M' FOR MEDIOCRE,"There's no question that I hold Alfred Hitchcock to a higher standard than any other director. That's why, after multiple viewings, I simply consider this film to be fair. We have Ray Milland wanting to dispose of his wife, Grace Kelly for infidelity and money. So far, so good.But, within 10 minutes of the opening, we have Milland ""on a pulpit"" with his annoying voice droning on and on to a sleazy college acquaintance of how the latter is to commit the crime. Later, we have the equally annoying voice of ""Sherlock Holmes"" filling the airwaves, following the botched murder. Cummings is acceptable and Kelly is first rate, per usual. But,to me it's nothing but gab,gab,gab, with all of the ""action"" confined to one room. Additionally , one has to be ever alert to the latch key problem, lest the viewer becomes totally confused. All directors make poor films at times, even my personal favorite."
5,Good Old Murder-Mystery,"Recently I have noticed that I enjoy the older movies. I bought Dial M for Murder because I had heard how good it was. The comparisons between the plot of that murder mystery and the typical murder mystery of today is that this one was a little less predictable. As the story evolves you have an idea what is going to happen, but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat, until it actually happens. Definitely worth adding to your collection."
4,"Not hitchcock's best,...but still a very good film,...","Hitchcock close to his best,..very good movie for a variety of reasons. Although the plot doesn't contain too many intersting twists, it is executed very effectively as hitchcock often did and raises the movie from good to he ""would own"" level. If you buy this you will not be disappointed. Hitchcock's best work would have to be Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho but this won't disappoint at all."
3,Samsung,I have a Samsung plasma TV and the 3D keeps switching in and out. Other than that the movie was great and the color was great. I liked it a lot
4,Great film -- too bad it's not really available for purchase on Unbox,"This is classic Hitchcock, and is one of Grace Kelly's best roles. It's a shame that this movie isn't actually available for purchase by download, even though the Unbox site says that it is. As of today, anyway, the movie can be rented, but it can't be purchased for $8.99. False advertising?"
4,DVD in 3D please...,"I finally found this at the video store last night. An excellent movie...very well paced, and keeps your interest right from the onset. Grace Kelly is amazing as always, as is the rest of the cast. Hopefully, when the DVD comes out, it will include the 3-D version of this classic! Comparing it to other Hitchcock films, it has to rank among the top ones...however, it is hard to find a bad Hitchcock film (except ""the Trouble with Harry""!)"
2,A BIG disappointment from the master of suspence,"Even though I am a hard-core Hitchcock fan, I didn't really enjoy this corny film about a man who hires his friend to murder his wife knowing that she is having an affair with another man (what a plot). Slippery, slimy and slow but like all of Hitch's films, this one dose have it's moments."
2,Dial M for Murder,"This to me is one of Hitchcocks's lack luster movies. It's so dated now, it's almost comedic. How Ray Milland and Robert Cummings were leading men I will never understand.Milland is so stocic and Cummings such a girlie man. In your wildest dreams you can't imagine Kelly falling in lovewith Cummings."
2,Not One Of Hitch's Best...,Tennis-playing husband has plans to murder his wife after suspecting of her having an affair with another man. Hitchcock was aiming at something a little different here but only halfway succeeded with mostly predictable outcomes and odd stagy dialogue. Grace Kelly fares best as a frantic spouse.
2,Only 3D could save this loser....,"Grace Kelly, in training, had not discovered how to GLOW for the camera. Reportedly having an affair with Milland at the time, there is no chemistry to suggest they are aware each other is on the same soundstage. Robert Cummings, mega-dosing on vitamins, would have been better served by an anachronistic vial of Viagra. Sir Alfred is asleep at the wheel this time around, too. A 3-D pair of bloody scissors tossed into the DVD audience would help disturb the snooze. Apparently the rotund one had not yet calculated how a significant musical score might help a turkey fly!"
2,this original version actually sucks big time,"terrible scripted movie with lot of holes. but once i got to see the 'perfect murder' by mike douglas and g. paltrow, all the holes had been patched nicely. i simply could not stand to watch this old movie with patience since it got so many holes and horrible scenes in it. i didn't and won't fall for a movie just because it's done by the old master and this one simply sucks big time."
1,Avoid,"I could hardly stand to finish it. Grace Kelly is simply awful as Margot, and there is NO chemistry between her character and her supposed love interest, Mark Halliday. I was seriously rooting for the conniving husband, Tony Wendice, at the end. Predictable, boring story with bad acting. I guess even Hitchcock delivers the occasional turkey!"
4,Marilyn rocks!,"Marilyn is a hairdresser in Switzerland. She's overweight, underemployed, and is having an affair with the mayor of the town. Meanwhile Georg, her partner in the salon would like to marry her and she also strikes up a friendship with a gay musician named Halil.Marilyn has dreams of being a singer and composing her own songs. Her journey from hairdresser/mistress to singer composer is both touching and funny.I especially liked the other characters in the movie, who at first frustrate her, but who come through and support her in the end."
4,Poignant and moving---a successful accomplishment!,"...Dugan gives us, in a modest, yet epic, volume, a veritable bildungsroman--an American picaresque for the 21st Century. The protagonist of this work (and I apologize, but I don't have the novel in front of me so I cannot remember his name) leaves an indelible mark on the reader. Dugan, in polishes prose, weaves a tapestry of adventure for this young man to journey forth on. Through college, into the legal system, and beyond. We are carried into a world which we know surrounds us, yet most of us know little about. It's quite a successful accomplishment on many levels. And a real quick read.If Dugan has one failure, it's his over-reliance on traditional narrative discourse. His narrator rarely challenges us, or asks us to suspend our preconceived judgments about our expectations. Instead, he gives us a finely wrought yarn that is mainly traditional, yet solid..."
3,Works for a year but...,"After a year, finally have to toss it. The sliver material is starting to come off by itself. Tossed it 2 weeks ago. So... little over a year. Overall, very satisfy with the product, for a year. It does makes a lot difference now that I don't have this shade on my car. Its is definitely thicker than other one I saw. Only down side I personally experienced is that it is too wide for my '09 Accord and the silver material is coming of. Well, time to look for a new one. =] And, its not blue, silver on both side."
3,dont own it but question for thoseo who do,"This appears to be a nice screen for the windshield and a few people seem to like it, but if you look at the product details, the dimensions are silly. Is this a typo? 23in wide by 6 in height. Not sure what kind of itty bitty car that would work on but not my crossover. This alone has kept me from buying it, and one has to wonder if its just a typo. Or maybe I am stupid, LOL , but I don't understand so cannot buy it."
4,Works well,I have found this much more effective than the cheap thin ones you can buy in the stores. I have a Mazda 3 and it easily fits my screen with a little over either end.
5,Does make a difference,I have a corolla 2010. The screen fits in terms of height but not width. The size is too wide for the windshield. But I am only concerned with the height since the width can be easily adjustable by folding some part inward. This is a really good screen. I can feel the difference when I get in the car.
4,Like SPF 50 for your car.,"While too large for the car I'm using the shade in, the installation is still easy and quick which I think is important for this product. It has performed very well; especially true during the Inferno like weather we ""enjoyed"" last week and will probably revisit before the summer is over. It certainly spared us that stifling blast one usually gets from entering a scorched car on a hot and sunny day."
5,Fred Halpern was the first boy to the moon...,"but the fact is, while he might be able to figure vectors and orbits in his head, he just can't seem to follow orders or stay out of trouble. Also accidents seem to happen around him no matter how much or how hard he tries to do his best.So when a spaceship crashed on the moon, Fred found himself in a trap. The people at the base had been given the ship's general location via the space station. He KNEW the info was wrong and he also knew where the ship was, but the Moon base only had so many tractors or men to search with and they couldn't mess this up the first time. They didn't have the time!Now Fred had two ways to handle this. He could obey orders and let two men die. Or he could go out on his own and maybe save the two men by disobeying a direct order."
1,An overpriced guide to science fiction,"This is essentially the Scientology equivalent of the companion for the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It is, at best, a reference for those interested in the inner trappings of a cult."
5,A must for anyone seeking healing and help,"I found this book in a very unlikely place...a clothing store. I bought several copies of it. Gave one to my husband (and therefore myself) and to several other friends. It enhances meditation, has a healing and helping message, supports spiritual searching or affirmation, is beautifully written and recorded (the CD). Everyone I gave it to has thanked me over and over. It's not just a one time listen...I actually haven't heard the entire CD all the way through yet. I plan to gift many of my friends and family with this at Christmas. I heartily recommend it."
3,Too airy fairy for me.,"Sorry, but this one was a little too ""airy fairy"" for me. I bought it because of all the positive reviews on Amazon, but was disappointed. The CD was like a fairy tale told to children as was the text of the book.I do believe in angels, but I would hope they would treat me like an adult, not some simple-minded child!To each his own!"
1,Do not order!,This is not a 12 pack it is a 2 pack. When you get the two boards the company will simply tell you they are listed wrong in amazon and you can return them. Major rip off.
4,Works well,"Works well, showed up fast. Only problem I had was with installing this. Maybe there is a trick to it that I don't know of, but took several minutes of prying this on. If I ever get rid of my truck im gonna leave it, so the next owner has to deall with it. Looks great and improves handleing quite a bit."
5,Beautiful!!!!,This photobook was beautiful. This was a perfect gift for my parents as a rehearsal wedding present and I recommend this to anyone!
2,This sateen is a finish that washes out,"I purchased three sets of Wamasutta 300-Thread-Count Egyptian Sateen Sheets and thought I had made an investment that would last for years. The sheets looked lovely, the colors bright with a soft sheen, the texture smooth with satin like feel. I consider myself a ""laundry care queen"" always carefully following the manufacturers care instructions: within two washes the ""Sateen"" look and feel of the sheets was completely gone (washed out).The sheets are very dull and very much wrinkled. They're still soft and serviceable but now I also doubt the thread count. My supposedly lesser quality sheets are more comfortable and attractive."
2,Too big,"I have a deep matress with a 2"" memory foam and a matress cover, still this sheet is to big, I thought I even got the wrong size but no, it is the right size but it is too big and it wrinkless because of it. I would not buy it again and which I could return it but it is a hasle to do so."
3,nice overall,"the sheets are of nice quality and the pockets are deep enough for the thickest mattress. i was not entirely happy with the color. i expected the 'aqua' to be softer, however it was more of a dusky shade."
3,Sun Faded Sheets,"Sheets were what I expected.... nice quality, BUT they came with sun fading from what looked like they sat in the package in the sun.I didn't return them because my girlfriend wanted to use them."
3,Not worth the price!!!,I bought two of the fitted sheets separately from Amazon about 6 months ago for about $10 each!!!! And they are just OK - not spectacular. Now why the whole set costs over $100 is a different question altogether!
1,WILL NOT WORK WITH TYPE II CF CARDS,"This adapter only accepts Type I CompactFlash cards, IT WILL NOT WORK with Type II CF cards because they are thicker than a Type I and the slot in this adapter isn't large enough. Amazon's picture appears to be an older version which WOULD accept a Type II CF card, but SimpleTech's current version of model# STI-CFADII is different. CHECK FOR YOURSELF before wasting your time and money: http://www.simpletech.com/estore/index.php?partNumber=STI-CFADII"
3,Elements of Music used book,"arrived in good time, well packaged, a bit more 'used' that described, but all in once piece and usable."
4,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"Everything was awesome. Ordering to receiving...very impressed with the timing. Already wrapped and under the tree. Only concern is that the cover of the DVD case is different than what is pictured. Ai big deal? Not really, in the scheme of things. Just hoping everything is alright with the actual dvd. I haven't tested it yet because it is currently a wrapped gift. Wished the picture matched what is pictured for consistency sake...thats it. It cost a star in the rating. Thanks for the timely delivery."
5,Memories!!,This is my one of my families FAVORITE movies. It really brings back old memories! We have been looking for it for a while...... and we finally found it!!! Although I ordered it and it looked nothing like it does on the picture......... pretty cheesy looking. It is still a classic!
5,This movie is a classic for all ages,"This is Dick Van Dyke at his best, maybe one of his greatest performances ever. The scene in the movie where he and the beautiful Ms.Howe are musical toys is by far one of the best done musical performances I have ever seen. When I first saw this movie as a child I thought it was the most wonderful magical thing I'd ever seen, now it is one of children's favorites."
1,"Great movie, but why oh why not widescreen?","I refuse to buy this DVD even though I LOVE the movie. The grandeur and scope of this film is breathtaking, and too much is lost if viewed in pan and scan. I still have my laserdisc player, and my widescreen version of CCBB is one reason. If you are not a fan of widescreen, by all means get this DVD - the movie is a must-have for any collection. I, for one, am still waiting for a widescreen version (and maybe extras, too?)."
5,Sweet childhood memories,Absolutely in my top 5 favorite movies from my childhood! Also bought a copy for my brother to share with his family.
5,Very Good Bang Bang For The Buck,We are very pleased with this Blu-ray disc. The detail is amazing as with the sound. It was like watching the movie for the first time. The movie was viewed on a Samsung 1080p 3-D plasma and a Samsung Blu-ray 3-D player.
2,Great movie - disappointing DVD,"This is one of my family's favorite movies -- the low rating is for the pan and scan version. Why do so many studios insist on altering the creative content of their family films? A simple solution is to offer both versions of the film on the same DVD. It's a shame that a film like this - originally presented in Panavision - suffers from a poor DVD release. Otherwise, the wonderful and original Sherman Brothers score - plus the charm of the film's actors and the beauty of the location filming - are as much fun now as they were 30 years ago."
1,It's a PAN and SCAN SHAM!,"Well, I'm commenting on the DVD, not the movie. It's a WIDESCREEN FILM, and with the technology being what it is, what a shame they couldn't have issued the Pan and Scan on one side, and the REAL movie on the other (WIDESCREEN). Blowing the film up to fill the frame, and then panning and scanning it dillutes the overall image, but worse, reveals the film grain to an extent that it creates a muddy image. DEFINETLY DO NOT BUY! Wait for the Widescreen version."
5,What's not to luv about this movie?,"This is one of those excellent movies, a flashback to childhood, filled with great music! And, of course, one of my all-time favorite actors, Dick Van Dyke. If you've never seen this movie then by all means get it and watch it. If you have kids you must have this in your family library. Brings a smile to my face just typing this up!"
1,great movie wrong region,When I purchased this I didn't realize it would not work in the US. I am very disappointed that it will not play.
1,Didn't play in any DVD player!,"My husband got this for me for christmas and it wouldn't play in any of our DVD players. We tried in a Sanyo, a sony and a PS3. NOTHING! I was so mad!"
4,REALLY GOOD!!,"for parents out there, there is no nudity except that in one part the weirdo pretends to be a chick with a vagina but you don't see too much. Really good movie and a classic."
1,Disappointed,"I was very upset and disappointed when I discovered that the dvd was not viewable in our region. We live in the USA and not in Japan, Europe, etc!!! There should have been something to make the customer more aware of what they were buying. Now I have a dvd that I can't view and can't return.....it is useless to me!"
1,only one star because you can't give less,"I read this book to my kids and we all loved it. The movie, however, was cringingly bad -- I consider it a horror flick for kids. Beware if you think your children would be disturbed by a character that goes around stealing children and putting them in a cage."
2,Chitty Chitty No Bang,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang on DVD but NO WIDESCREEN and no bang for your buck.Why issue a classic widescreen epic on DVD if you are not going to present it in its original aspect ratio? This DVD is presented in Full Frame.The Laser Disc was in Widescreen. I made the mistake of waiting for it to come out on DVD. VHS will do for now. Thank you very much.Another stone cold waste of DVD. Count Zborowski must be as disapointed about this DVD as he was when he lost the original Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang in 1922.
3,Great for Kids,"My 12 year old really enjoyed it, but it isn't my favorite story. Too much slapstick by the time you get to the pirate story. The car is cool, though!"
5,ChittyChittyBangBang,"A wonderful movie with a delightful cast, great movie for kids to watch, and written by Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond."
4,Lotsa Fun,"The music is great -- I enjoyed singing along. There are a lot of laughs and some clever surprises. Maybe a bit overdone in spots (emphasis on the fact that the kids weren't in school because they didn't want to be, and the ""goblin"" character with the silly nose), but all in all it kept my attention from beginning to end. I look forward to watching it again."
4,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang : funny and cute,"My kids love this movie. Lots of music and songs. Even though my kids are french speaking, they love this english version. It is funny, full of surprises and they watch it over and over... Definitely a must have!"
4,What a Bang,"I bought this for my daughter who is three years old, I remembered how much fun it was when I was a child. She loves the dancing and singing and Dick Van Dyke does put a lot of fun into the movie. Enjoy to movie for what it is - a lot of family fun."
5,Wonderful!!!,"This is a perfect edition to any childs movie collection, no matter how old they are! I remember watching this movie over and over again when I was young and I had decided to buy it for my little one for her movie collection. She is just two years old and she sat through the entire movie with me, dancing and singing! She loved every minute of it! I hope everyone enjoys this movie as much as we do!"
2,Disappointing DVD fake,"Why are studios making DVDs like this one in regular 4:3 format when there is the alternative for a wide screen like in the case of this beautiful but mutilated movie? Why is not the market refusing to sell this kind of [stuff] to discourage the production of this consumer misleading fake? If I wanted an antique I would buy a videotape instead a DVD. After all, we are already in the 21st century, aren't we?"
5,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,This movie will keep the attention of kids and adults. The music is wonderful. It has great values and the language is all good.
3,"Sadly, it's anotherDisney failed attempt... =(","Although Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is a timeless classic, you half wish that Disney added a Spanish option to it. I got it as a gift for my father (along with a few others), and due to lack of description upon buying it from Amazon only had the options of English and French."
4,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"After watching Mary Poppins for the first time with our 7 and 4 year old, we realized these old classics have a lot to offer. Kids enjoyed the music. Humor was right on target for them and the story line kept them engaged for the entire 2+ hours. Wish there were more movies like this available."
5,One quality Blu Ray video!,"Now here is a Blu Ray transfer that is truly outstanding!The video quality, given the age of this movie, is truly outstanding.They must have kept the master in a environmentally controlledroom/vault for sure.[no doubt]Amazing video quality, especially when viewed on a good quality video set up.[or even a basic Blu Ray set up]Obvously when they filmed this movie, they used a very high quality recording system/tape,then carefully preserved it.Highly recommended on the video quality alone, not to mention its 2:30 minute content!BM"
5,Great Purchase.,"I have always loved this movie. Now in Blu-Ray its even better. The colors, and video quality is amazing. This movies is a must buy."
5,"""Chitty"" is a MUST HAVE for anyone who owns a VCR","This edition is fantastic - the digitally mastered VHS is much better than the previous versions. ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" is a must to anyone's collection of movies regardless of gender or age. The cinematography is fantastic and the charactors are delighful and of course, you will find yourself happily singing along. Great gift."
5,Great!,"Very cheap but so worth it! Works perfectly, nothing wrong at all with it.Came very quickly in the mail."
5,Chitty Chitty,"I saw this movie in the theatre many years ago, around the year 1968, I was a teenager, I loved the musical so much I decided to purchase the dvd, It is a family movie and will be enjoyed by every mmember of your family old or young.James JonesStaten Island, NY"
5,great DVD for kids of all ages!,"Gave this movie to a little girl who turned 9 on her birthday this year (2012) - she had borrowed our copy of CCBB and loved it. She loves anything with Dick Van Dyke in it - that's how we are as well. Would HIGHLY recommend this movie to anyone! Some slightly scary parts (the guy who kidnaps the kids using the ""candy ploy"")....otherwise great musical. Might be a little long (2 hours) for little ones. The music is very catchy."
1,I should have read the reviews first,"I should have read the reviews first. I did not notice that it was NOT a letterboxed edition. Why go to all the trouble of restoring the sound and picture and then cutting a third of it out. This is an enjoyable and fun film for the whole family, but what a waste of a DVD."
1,Full screen...,"A gorgeous film, perfectly restored picture and good restored 5.1 sound. BUT how dare they to cut it down to full screen. The opening is letterboxed, you can read that the film is in s u p e r panavision. After the opening the curtain closes halfway.That ""1 star"" is for the fullscreen version - should be ""no stars"". The rest is ""five stars"""
3,Wait for WideScreen Format,"As others have stated, I intended to buy this DVD, until I realized it's ""reformatted for your screen."" I have a DVD in standard format -- I want widescreen, again because so much of the movie is missing when it's reformatted. I'll wait."
5,Classic,Probably one of my favourite childhood films. It is a Christmas viewing must in my family. We watch with the song subtitle option and sing along...great fun!
2,Forgot lots of it. Quite disappointed now,"I only remembered a song or two, but I remembered humming them quite a bit, so I thought I'd get it for my kids.Ugh! It's too long, too pointless, and takes too long to develop. Well, that could be forgivable, but I forgot about that child kidnapper. The minute he hit the screen, I remembered the nightmares he gave me. I'm back in therapy now (ha ha), but I'm not sure I can do that to my under 7 year old kids. Also, there's the whole the baron is trying to kill the baroness side plot, and the creepy people/toys.Also, what's the with the dance number with the baroness in her underwear. I may be overly protective of my kids, so maybe for others it'd be OK, but I threw it away after the first viewing."
1,EMBARRASING,"Watching this incredibly corny movie, I really feel embarrased for the poor CAR !....It's this movie's only redeeming feature. In my opinion, a great movie to watch with the sound turned off. But still, it's harmless enough and I guess there have been worse movies made."
2,Disappointed its not in widescreen format,"As for the movie, I loved it as a kid and I love it more now....and I expect more as an adult as well. With the hefty pricetag of a new DVD edition, I expect to see the entire film, not a cut-up version, formatted for the small screen. Imagine...Chitty Chitty floating blissfully through the sky, and most of the sky cut out! The stately castle scenes, with half of the scenery cut out! How disappointing!"
3,Not for 4 and 5 year olds,"I saw the movie many years ago and thought it would be fun for the kids to see. We ordered the original book from amazon.com and have read it to them several times. They loved the book, but the movie was not for them. First of all, it is about 2 1/2 hours long. Secondly, it was nothing like the book (which is true for most movies), thirdly the entire ""child catcher"" thing terrified them! My five year old was also very uspet about the children living underground and having to ""steal food from the kitchen."" For children this age purchase and read them the book!"
2,maybe they'll listen...,"maybe for their 45th anniversary edition MGM will remember themselves and put it in WIDE SCREEN FORMAT!!! there is SO much that is lost in the pan&scan; version. when a film was done back in the 60s, wide screen was a perc still and MGM was still the best at utilizing the format. the wider the better and the more of the screen you used to pull in your audience the better,too. well, with today's technology, it's not uncommon to find that a film is done in both perspectives to apease everyone, but super panorama was engulfing. i miss that feeling. the film is pretty much only 1/2 there, and 1/2 a musical is just annoying. will not buy it till it's out and done proper. i have & LOVE the mary popins dvd - that was done right...4/20/4 - thank you, thank you, thank you!"
4,The Grandkids (3 & 5) seemed to like it a lot,"I bought the ""cheap"" DVD, because little kids don't care about wide-screen or interviews or extras. They like color, action, interesting characters, and lively songs. The next day, the girl (5) asked me to play specific scenes: the song ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" and the ""dancing dolls"" routine. She even liked the name ""Truly Scrumptious"". The only problem with small children is ""Why ..."" and ""How ..."" every few minutes. I wasn't sure at first if the adventures in Vulgaria were part of the fantasy story or ""real"", so I just kept saying, ""It's magic"". Later, we pretended my Outback could float and fly.As for me? I'm a big fan of Dick Van Dyke, so I kind of enjoyed it -- and having never watched films on DVD until recently, I guess I liked the color, action, interesting characters, and lively songs. How about that?"
3,Simple Story - Simple Songs,"I can't see how this movie can compete with all the newer, more flashy kids' movies that are available. However, the story is simple and sweet and so are the songs. I bought the movie because my autistic daughter likes simple musicals which feature kids and she enjoys listening to me sing the movie's songs which are so easy to learn. There are better choices for Disney movies from this era, like Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks."
3,Where's the WIDESCREEN version?,"On January 2001, a WIDESCREEN version of Chitty Chitty BangBang was broadcast on TV in Tokyo (This is true!). Why don'tMGM release a WIDESCREEN version DVD in market? Stragefeeling isn't it?"
2,Rhymes with Chitty,"This is still one of my all-time favourite musicals. As a toddler, the kidnapper terrified me so much, I crouched down behind the seat of our convertible (Drive-In showing) and never came back up for the duration of the film, eventually falling asleep. It was Years later that I had the opportunity to view it again. Bear in mind that in those days you had One shot of viewing and retaining the memory of it. How disappointing that the DVD version of this classic is Not in widescreen and features the ridiculous intermission segment which backtracks prior to plummeting off the cliff. The laserdisc version, presented in Widescreen, is far superior, though it also includes the forementioned intermission segment. A 5-star film in a 2-star format."
1,"HELLLLOOOO: DVD = Widescreen, VHS Tape = Standard","Why do some of these studios keep releasing movies on DVD that they have chopped up? If some demented editor thinks a Standard version is necessary for TV viewing, then offer BOTH Widescreen AND Standard on the DVD (some do)...I want to see and hear the movie as it was shown in the theater - not chopped up for the few viewers who are going to watch their movie on a 13"" portable. Do the movie producers hate non-theater consumers so much that they refuse to create DVDs with BOTH Widescreen AND decent sound? Some of their products say, ""YES, we do""."
5,don't let the kids miss this one,after renting this movie and watching my children dance and sing was worth the price of buying the movie. Truly a classic to view over and over.
5,Bought for my granddaughter,This is a fun movie. Disney doesn't let you down with the fun and songs and colors and great cast. My granddaughter loves it.
3,"good for kids then, but its no classic",A servicable kids' movie; with little for the present day viewer. Here are nine more words to satisfy the minimum.
4,chitty chitty bang bang,I received the DVD Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in a very timely manner. I would definitely order from Amazon again.Thank you for your quick response to my order!
3,Region???,"I guess I missed the fact that this DVD was coming from Ireland which is a different ""Region"" and therefore would not play in my DVD player. No wonder it was less expensive... and available. Seller was great but..."
1,COSMIC STUDIO RIPOFF AGAIN!,Shot in SUPERPANAVISION!!!! Bunged onto DVD in 4:3 without a thought. (Quick let's rip the stupid people off for Christmas)Get with the plot and don't buy this turkey DVDGreat film spoiled by the DVD distribution again!
2,"""Fullscreen"" (4:3) DVD's should no longer be sold","This full screen version ruins the entire movie. 2.20:1 was the intended aspect ratio and it has been cut short by 2/3 - so you're in essence loosing 66.6% of the movie!This, amongst other reasons, is why the UK made Widescreen standard in 1999 - and since all television shows produced in the UK were produced in Widescreen 16:9. Due to the switch to Widescreen all DVD's were released in their intended aspect ratio, in this case 2.20:1. Sure there was black bars on the top and bottom but that was because the 2.20:1 was too large to fit on a 16:9 display - and for Americans with their 4:3 displays letter boxing became an issue because most didn't like seeing the bars and would rather loose information rather than see the whole picture."
5,classic!,"I'm taking my 5 year old grand-daughter to see the musical ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" and wanted her to know the story before we go...this is one of my favorites from ages ago...definitely a classic that I want in my movie collection!"
3,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,"The quality of this movie left a lot to be desired. I loved the movie as a child and wanted to share it with my Grandchildren. I was sorely disappointed with the quality, and there were several glitches throughout the movie. An old movie does not mean the quality should be so bad from Amazon; it almost looked pirated."
5,Super family entertainment,Great entertainment for the entire family and elementary class. Hilariously funny and educational. Therapy for adults and great lessons for children. Recommended for class viewing and discussion.
1,Haul it off to the junkyard,"A dull, sophmoric musical about a turn of the century inventor-mechanic who turns a racing car into a flying and floating machine. While on the beach, he fantasizes about himself, his ladyfriend (the daughter of a candy-making tycoon), and two children named Jeremy and Jemima (who in the world would name their daughter Jemima?) flying off to a fantasy land where an evil king and queen keep children as prisoners. The acting and the story (loosely based on the one by the late British writer Ian Fleming) are lousy. The musical numbers are anything but memorable; especially the number ""Chu-chi face"" performed by the king and queen. This rank imitation of ""Mary Poppins"" is anything but entertaining and should definitely not be shown to young children."
1,Bad Quality - DVD stops in the middle and won't play.,"Pretty bad quality, next time I'll order a previously viewed selection rather than Amazon's new product!"
1,WHERE IS THE WIDESCREEN?!?!,"Why do the movie folks waste our time with these editions that are NOT of the same quality as the originals in the theatres? The vision for these movies is only captured fully in WIDESCREEN. Please, quit releasing old classics unless you offer it in widescreen."
5,a classic,Chitty Chitty Bang Bang should be a classic in every family home collection. This will be entertaining to children for all time.Other classics not to forget about are:Mary PoppinsMy Fair LadyThe Wizard of OzChitty Chitty Bang BandThe first Charlie and the Chocolate FactoryThe Sound of MusicOliverWest Side StoryFiddler on the RoofSinging in the RainThe WizLittle MermaidAladdinBeauty and the BeastGreaseThe King and IOklahomaThe Music ManSouth PacificMy Voice Students are always asking me for recommendations so I though I'd post it for all! We can't forget about these great musicals!
3,Liked it even though my friends made fun of me for liking it,"I liked this movie when I was little and would watch it when I could but one day when I was at my friend's house playing I told her and our other friends that Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was on TV and I was going home to watch it and they made fun of me and called me a baby etc, but I didn't care because I liked the movie and liked the songs etc, and I thought Dick Van Dyke was awesome and I liked the kids who played his son and daughter and the actress who played his girlfriend was good too. There is a soundtrack too, I rented it a few times from the library and enjoyed listening to the cute songs."
5,Great family dvd...,"Great dvd of classic kids film. Order processed, shipped and delivered in a timely manner."
5,An all time family movie now back for a new generation,"I was a child when this first came out and I can still remember the sheer enjoyment I felt 25 years ago, now that I am much older. It is GREAT that a classic movie like this is now back in video version so that a whole new generation of 13 year olds and more can be enraptured by so delightful and enjoyable a story. Make sure that the younger generation gets this for Christmas - and watch it several times yourself before wrapping that present.... Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003), who saw this in the cinema in 1968"
4,An all-time classic.....,"This film never did get the credit it deserved. The songs are instant favorites (despite what other reviewers might say about them). Any child that liked the Wizard of Oz or Willie Wonka would love this film too.Dick Van Dyke is very entertaining as a mad inventor that creates a magical car. This film has some of the most unforgettable scenes in cinema. This is the film that Grease (the movie) got it's closing scene from!! From the musical scene set in the candy factory, to the king of Bulgaria's birthday party, your kids will be watching this one over and over again. And you'll find yourself sneaking peaks as well.My advice? Buy it today!"
5,Lots of bang left in this classic,My Nieces LOVE this movie and whats not to like.Good clean wholesome entertainment. It was one of my favorites as a kid which makes it a classic in my book!
5,Excellent Resource,The Student Larousse Dictionary is an excellent resource and a very convenient size. Am trying to relearn French after many years and need all the help I can get.
4,great dictionary,"As a student of French, I found this to be a great product. I do agree with another review I read in that this is geared toward the beginner students. It has great illustrations with the corresponding French word, which makes it fun and easy to learn the language,in addition to the more traditional dictionary format. I am studying to become a French teacher. I wish I could afford to buy enough copies of this for an entire class. I think they would find this really helpful."
1,Great format but not very useful to beginners,"As a student fairly new to French I scoured my local BN for a good English-French dictionary for beginners and settled on this one due to its format. After using the dictionary for only a few weeks I cannot overstate my disappointment. I reach for it constantly, and roughly 60% of the time, the dictionary fails to include a word I need as part of my ""beginner 2"" class at the Alliance Francaise. In hindsight, the format for this volume is not so much better than other dictionaries that it merits purchasing. I would pass on this one and get something more comprehensive with less bells and whistles."
1,WRONG ORDER,II DID NOT REEIVE THE BOOKI ORDERED I ORDERED SPANISH/ENGLISH DICTONARYU AND RECEIVED FRENCH I HAVENOT YET RTEVEIVED THE CORRECT BOOK I AM DISSAPOINTED
4,Works as advertised,"I just received a refurbished DWL-G710, and it has succeeded in getting full reception to problem areas. It can be placed just outside the normal range for some computers (better WiFi reception than most adapters), and it will rebroadcast the signal without a problem.It was not the easiest thing to get working; you can't rely on the setup wizard itself to handle all the configuration. After a bit of tweaking, however, it began working properly. For these setup woes, I ding it one star, but since it gets the job done, it gets to keep the other four.The price for a new one is too high (at $75, I would have just run some ethernet cable and moved the router or placed a second access point), but if you can find one for $30 (like I did), it is a good deal."
1,Dlink DWl-G710,"D-Link DWL-G710 Wireless Range Extender, 802.11g, 54MbpsI followed the directions perfectly. I could not get the extender to work. I called Dlink support. After the tech person gathered some personal and product info, she hung up on me. I called back and after going thru the extensive menu found myself waiting on the tech line for someone to answer. I gave up and tried again. Even though I have a Dlink router, I just could not get this thing to work."
4,Good product with poor instructions,"This can be really annoying to set up but worth the effort once running. To get it there just follow Derek Wong's excellent post, though I found I needed to vary from it slightly at the end(perhaps because I'm connecting to a Netgear WPN824 router using an Apple Powerbook instead).Only difference was the site survey found the desired network, but stuck a hole lot of spaces at the front of the SSID after clicking Connect for some reason. You will need to remove these spaces to make sure the SSID is exactly the same. Make sure you are using a DHCP (default) setup for the wireless network and you should be away. Unplugging the unit, waitin a few seconds and plugging it in again may also help once you have done all the above."
1,Mine was defective,"I purchased this extender to go with my DI-624 wireless router. The productive was pronounced defective by D-link support.When I attempted to set the WEP key, the device would hang on restart. I had to unplug the power from the unit to get it to restart. I upgraded the firmware of my router and the range extender. The problem persisted. Got D-link support on the phone, they suggested I try downgrading the firmware. No success. I returned it, but there were no replacements available.I will try again, but this time I will try the DWL-G800AP."
2,Limited routers work with DWL-G710,"Great idea, but limited to specific D-Link routers (not all) as I have a DIR-625 > Range Booster N Router and it won't work. Make sure you know what routers this extender will work with."
1,The D-Link DWL-G710 Wireless Range Extender is Garbage,"I bought the D-Link DWL-G710 Wireless Range Extender and was able to get it working when no security was applied to the wireless network. As soon as I applied any sort of security (on both the main router and the extender), the extender stopped allowing DHCP forwarding and clients could not get on the network. I worked with Tech Support. They acknowledged the problem, but had no idea how to fix it.I ended up reutrning the extender for a refund."
1,Did not work with a DWL-514 Wireless Router,"Although D-Link stated that this range extender was compatible with my DWL-514 wireless router, I was unable to get it to work with my system. I called D-Link tech support many times but they did not know what the problem was and did not make much of an effort to solve the problem. I would not recommend this product if someone has the older DWL-514 wireless router. It's possible that this range extender will work with D-Link's newer routers.I recently purchased the Belkin Pre-N wireless router with the Pre-N PCI card and both work great. I found that the installation for the Belkin to be effortless and its support manual to be superior to D-Link's supporting materials. My signal strength has increased greatly and my speed has increased by over 99x!"
1,Wireless product,"Dear Sirs,unfortunatly i can not make a right review simply because the product is still in USA, Columbus, by my son Diego that he will brings back to Italy middle of June.At that time will be my pleasure to make the review.Best regardsG. Mandelli"
1,BEWARE FOR MASOCHISTS ONLY,"Istall only to find inoperative as I have received a defective unit. At own expense return unit and weeks later receive a replacement. Install new unit that seems to be too easy to believe - it was and the new unit crashed my PC - system restore and system repair could not remove certain conflicting netwrok related codes. I get to toally rebuild my system with an entire reinstall. PS - insult to injury DLink wants me to return the unit to Amazon as the original purchase made there and guess what the 30 day window is now closed. UNLESS YOU NEED SOMETHING TO DO IN YOUR SPARE TIME DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT. This from someone ""familiar"" with computers.Have a nice day!"
1,WARNING - ONLY WORKS WITH D-LINK ROUTERS,"I just purchased this unit to extend the range of a 2Wire Wireless router / modem unit. I was unable to configure the unit and upon calling D-Link Technical Support Line (busy the first 3 times), I was told by a very courteous rep that the unit I bought only works with D-Link routers. So basically D-Link blatantly lies when it states on the box ""Works with virtually all 802.11g/b routers and access points"". I carefully repackaged the unit and am sending it back to Amazon for a refund."
5,Works like a champ..setup in 5 minutes,"After I read some folk's horror stories, I was really reluctant to purchase this device. Well, it took me only 5 minutes to configure the DWL-G710, and another 10 minutes to find the best place for it in the house. It was really simple and it worked well with our Comcast/Netgear wireless cable modem.Excellent product."
2,"May work, may not--do your research first","If you don't have D-link equipment, do your homework before buying this repeater. It may work with your setup, it may not. Make sure you find someone on the net who has successfully set up the unit with your specific configuration and find out how they did it. We use Netgear WG302 WAPs. I spent as much time trying to set up the DWL-G710 as we could afford. A subsequent look on the web revealed that other IT professionals have had no success with this specific configuration. Don't make my mistake--do your research first."
1,piece of junk,"I've gone thru multiple revisions of firmware, and multiple calls to D-Link support, and this piece of junk still does not work with the D-Link DWL-G700AP. D-Link support calls are worthless. As a computer professional, I find it appalling that D-Link would introduce and continue to sell this product, which clearly does not operate correctly."
1,Don't expect this to go well,"5 hours and 6 lengthy calls to tech support is my limit. Only trying to install this with a D-Link DI-524 so the compatibility shouldn't have been an issue. All five times we/I finally got the router to recogize the extender, it never actually synched up with a solid WLAN light on the extender, no increased signal strength at a computer more than 8' from the router, and the brilliant technical advice that ""I am happy to inform you that some routers do not have solid signal light, blinky light be o.k."" finally put me over the edge.I'd rather pull cable or just buy another router at this point."
3,Support Needed,"Unless you know, the set up was a real mind cracker ... Had to get support and paid extra money.Works OK but have to reset both (router and extender) once a week."
1,Don't bother buying it.,"The one thing that is consistent with all reviews on this product is you must call customer service. Instructions are useless. On the 4th call to customer service I was advised that it will only work with a limited (few) routers. Go to the D-links web site, click on support and find the 10 routers (mostly d-link) that it works with. It would have been nice if the literature suggested how limiting the possible success rate will be or the first tech would have brought the issue up. If you bothered to read these reviews, please save time and aggrevation by looking at another product."
1,Does not work,"I purchased the DLink DWL-G710 range extender because I already had a Dlink DI-524 router. I assumed that this would make the setup easier.The manual is hard to understand if you are not a teckie. I tried several times on my own to configure the unit and then broke down and called their tech support. After 2 hours on the phone, the tech support person informed me that the extender would not work with my router. She said the firmware was too recent on the router to work properly with the range extender. I asked for a refund and she refused. She basically said they had no extender that would work with my router. Needless to say I was very disappointed. Do not purchase this if you have any firmware above 1.05 on the DI-524 Router."
1,Did not work,"I couldn't get it to work. The help line wanted me to try new setting after new setting, but they failed as well. In all fairness, I did not have direct access to the router, which is a locked room.I returned it for credit.I bought a lynksys instead from circuit city. It automatically picked up the signal and extended it to my laptop. It works the same way as the laptop does when I check into a hotel. No chacnge in settings required."
2,D Link DWL-G710 Wireless Range Extender,"I finally got this device to work, but it was not from any help in the instructions or D-Link's website. I had to experiment for many hours to find the right combination of settings on my wireless router (also a D Link, but not friendly to the G710). When LAN is connected for the setup and the setting are finally perfected, it gives an IP conflict error. It does not seem like the folks at D Link really appraoched this from a regular person's perspective to make the installation and functioning simple and transparent. As I said, it works, and I like that part, but getting there was not easy, and in this day and age, that is a big miss."
2,Don't love them.,These are huge. In the description it says they are 4mm. The package says 6mm. They are way too big and look funny. Make sure you are wanting a really large stone if you order these.
3,nip/tuck,This series was not actually what I had in mind. It served its purpose and was priced reasonably. Perhaps I will purchase another series and give it another shot...only if its at a good price.
1,Most repulsive TV trash from Warner Brothers.....,"This is a really ugly and repulsive series. If you can ignore the title that makes you think of needles, the cast are just plain awful. There is no acting and no point to it. It's garbage."
1,Blown Away!,"UNBELIEVABLY poorly written. Seriously folks, the situations and particularly the dialogue left me aghast! Don't believe all those five star reviews you read or any rave review from USA Today or TV Guide. This is a new low."
1,Beyond Stupid,"One wonders about all the people giving this a full five stars... I found Nip & Tuck to be the most hopelessly unrealistic, melodrama packed show I've ever watched. Period. Obviously, it works for some. Couldn't finish the first episode."
4,A gift for someone.,"Well someone asked me to buy this item so I bought two, and they are really enjoying the product."
5,Perfect 10.,"I missed the entire first season when it was first shown on TV and caught couple of episodes during encore presentation and immediately bought it on DVD. This show is absolutely flawless. Perfect cast, perfect stories, perfect acting. Characters are so rich and interesting that you get involved and get caught up in their lives from the very beginning.Show is not however for everyone. It is very edgy, provocative, sexy and at times somewhat disgusting (watching plastic surgery in detail may not be everyone's idea of fun). But shows creators deserve recognition for pushing each episode that close to the line and never crossing it. It is perfectly executed. And another thing to mention is a soundtrack accompanying the show. It is just as good as the show itself. Unfortunately I missed few episodes of season 2 as well. Can not wait till its out on DVD. If you have the nerves to take it, I strongly recommend watching it."
2,"review for TV Show, Nip/Tuck","this show is very bazzar, and very strange, i cant believe they actually made a show and got the budget for it, one of the first episodes in the first season, a lady who was a man previously, had her Dr put cocaine in her breast so she could return back to columbia so she can get some drug money.This season set is deffinatly not worth its value, it should be in the 20$ range if you do decide to buy, those of you who do buy it, i hope you enjoy it"
1,yeah right!,this is just for sick carlos! you really need this for yourself. and go make a 6 pack too! p as for...
1,Researching before writing an episode,"I've only watched the first episode and it was enough! How could people be so dumb when it comes to South America? Argentina is not the only country that has fluoride in the water; almost all the countries here have it, including Brazil for over 15 years. I'm a dentist and I know what I'm talking about. Please, if you want to talk about us you should study the subject first."
4,Sick but amazing.,"Nip/Tuck is the kind of show you might say is a guilty pleasure. In my opinion, Season 2 is the best season but Season 1 definitely had potential. Dylan Walsh, Julian McMahon and Jolie Richardson are such a talented trio! The storylines are outrageous and kind of stomach turning but there is something about this show that makes you crawling back for more. Seasons 4 and 5 were highly disappointing but season 1-3 were pure magic."
5,the nip/tuck where it all began,"very good-although i saw it, my wife just got into it this year, so i got her seasons 1-4 for christmas. season 1 was viewed in about 4 days.she's hoooked now!"
5,The Perfect Show,"This is my all time favorite show. I laugh, I cry, I cringe and I keep coming back for more. I have become absolutly obsessed with this show and its charectors. Each one is unique and is deeper than they first appear. I am buying the boxed set today even though I had already recorded all the episodes when they first aired as I'm still doing now. They just keep getting better and better!!!!"
3,What's All the Hype About,"Watching this first season DVD was my introduction to Nip/Tuck. After a couple years of friends telling me what a great show it was I finally took the plunge and decided to check it out. I half to say I don't know what all the hype was about. Yeah, it can be a fun, sexy show but some of the plots are boring and rather redundant -- even in the first season. Granted, I can see why Julian McMahon became the breakout star of the show -- he's very good and has developed a wonderful character you love to hate. Dylan Walsh and Joley Richardson's charcters, on the other hand, were very obnoxious. In the end, I just din't see the point. I'm not giving up, however. Those same friends tell me Season 2 was better, so I'll give it one more try."
4,Addictive!,"Refreshing to see a new show like this. When it was first released, I thought how can they stretch a theme about two plastic surgeons into a successful series? Well they have, and each show is both engaging and exciting.Season 1 is worth seeing, but Season 2 is even better! Many people missed Season 1 on TV, so obtaining this DVD box gives you the chance to see how it all started.In Australia, we are viewing the final episodes of Season 2. It is so popular here that the Tv Network is broadcasting it twice a week. Each episode of this latest season is enthralling and hard to switch off. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a series so much.I was not a fan of Julian McMahon before this show mainly because I remembered the shows he was in here in Australia before moving to LA. However, he is outstanding in Nip/Tuck. He has certainly perfected his art since the old days.Well done!"
2,mediocre at best,"For what it is, _Manchu_ does an ok job. But it has a ton of historical inaccuracies and even some internal inconsistencies (like One-Eyed Li being called One Eyed _before_ he loses his eye in besieging Kaifeng!). It's pure fluff and enjoyable in a cheesy sort of way. But _Shogun_ it ain't. And I found the representations of the three women in the book extremely shallow and one-dimensional, and Francis' relations to them uproariously funny in their insubstantiality. Do yourself a favor and search out some more substantial fare about Ming/Qing China if you have the chance--the real story is every whit as gripping as this fictional account, and far more rewarding. Try _The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci_ for more on the Jesuits, or any other book by Jonathan Spence for that matter--he's first rate."
3,"Pure fluff, to quote another reviewer","Follows the tired formula of plonking an English protagonist at the centre of great events in an 'oriental' society, in this case China during the last years of the Ming dynasty (early 1600's). Cycles through old stereotypes of Eastern eroticism, cruelty and deviousness. Unsurprisingly the historicity and characters are shallow and don't approach Clavell's 'Shogun', although it's better than Alan Savage's 'Eight Banners' (also set in China). On balance, passable entertainment for a rainy day. Just remember you're reading fiction and not history."
1,A Disappointment,"It lacked serious information and the photos were not that informative. I have been an Amazon customer for years, this is the only book I've returned."
1,not as pictured,It show the adapter with 2 squares of connecters and one on the side. What i got was a full row of connectors with no break. It doens't work with what i need to plug it into. Complete waste of money. don't buy this
4,As Expected,Not much to say about this adapter. It does it's job and is quite affordable compared to what you'll find at a big box store. My only complaint is that the thumb screws on the DVI side are small and hard to manipulate to secure the adapter to a monitor or TV.
5,Works as billed,This DVI to HDMI adapter is perfect for hooking a high definition television up to a computer with a digital output. There is no set up besides plugging in the wires and it works exceptionally well. Recommended for that use.
5,Works flawlessly,It works great on my GeForce 7800 GT. Displayed full 1080p on Sharp Aquos TV. Now I'm a happy gamer. Shipping was fast too.
5,Worked like a charm!,Not much to review about this item - does exactly as stated. Its all digital so dont get tempted into buying something more expensive just to get the same results. :)
1,Poorly made,"To start, one of the screws to secure the dongle in the DVI input was poorly inserted. I could not turn it easily. Once I did get it plugged in and secured with one screw, the video kept flickering on and off.Poorly made. Thank goodness for Amazon's no-hassle returns!"
2,Parecia usada,"La caja llego a mis manos destapada y muy sucia, adentro con marcas de manos y huellas de grasa. La caja estaba muy estropeada y no estaba sellada, no recomiendo a este vendedor."
1,This Series was a Huge Let down,"Started off Strong, it had an excellent intro and basic characters but it got way too off subject with boring Japanese School political structures and not enough fighting or interesting plot devices. There were instances where it looked as if there was going to be some serious action but they just talked it to death. My Favorite scene when Sechiro and the ""Nice Guy"" were fighting ing the lunch room, #1. punches were stopped with chopstick, 2. lots of punches and killer techniques and #3. When the street punk used a dirty trick to distract his opponenet. Lets just say he pays the price for his dishonorable tactics.Overall I would have to give this series a 3 out of 10. Just neflix the first 2 discs and call it a loss"
5,I love this movie,"I'll admit, it's pretty stupid in some ways. But as long as you have a sense of humor, this movie is great. My favorite part is the music scene. The cavemen have a vocabulary of about twenty words, but they do just fine. I wish there was a sequel."
3,Before everybody knew her name . . .,"Shelley Long upstages Ringo Starr, model Barbara Bach, and veteren comic actor Jack Gilford in CAVEMAN. The film came out about a year before Long was to star in the TV show Cheers, which launched her to deserved fame. She adds human feeling to CAVEMAN, an otherwise routine, albeit funny comedy, playing the cavewoman who can't compete with the stunning Barbara Bach for Ringo's love. Guys, don't skip guitar practice."
3,So bad it's good.,"It's just mindless fun. Great to see the roles Dennis Quaid and Shelly Long took in 1981. The effects are atrocious, but that's what makes it so great. Rubber dinosaurs and farting is just part of it. We also learn that a ""zillion"" years ago women were already being chosen based on breast size. A simple fun movie that I'd say is good for any age."
3,Caveman,We bought this DVD just because it was one of Ringo's only and maybe only movie he stared in. It was a hoot then and a hoot now. I purchased it because we wanted to enjoy it again. With four young stars in it who would of thought they would all make it as a career later. The price was great and I know it will be watched many time with our friend's. Amazon is a great site. With many great deal's on everything !
4,Goofy Hilarity,I love this movie! Goofy and fun with a lot of moments that make you smile or laugh. Can't wait to share it with my college-aged son. Reminiscent of Mel Brooks' genre.
4,"Fun, Just Fun!","Forget history, or paleontology, whatever... Fun, just fun! Beyond rock'n'roll, Ringo, with Dennis, give us a very nice show. This movie has a quarter of a century, but is timeless..."
3,Caveman,Whatch this movie years ago was glad to see it on DVD. Very funny and glad to add it to our collection.
3,Caaaaaavemaaaaaaaan!,"I'm not sure why I'm bothering to review Caveman, but what the hay? I haven't seen it since I was a kid and it was a regular on HBO. I recently watched it and still found it amusing. This was made in a time when you could get away with making films like this: THE 80s! Only in the 80s could a director walk up to a Hollywood exec and say, ""I'd like to make a comedy about cavemen with Ringo Starr as the lead"", and get funding for it. You can tell this film has a decent budget, not huge, but it's not a low budget film. If memory serves(I was very young, remember), Quest For Fire came out before this or right around the same time, and I guess this film was supposed to be kind of a spoof or flipside to that film. The humor in Caveman is quite juvenile(naturally), but it does get clever and pretty funny in some places. Unfortunately it's not as funny as it was when I was a kid. And how did they get Ringo Starr to be in this film?"
2,An oddity,"Stupid, inane slapstick with a few ""doo doo"" and flatulence jokes tossed in (out of desperation?) for good measure. No acting was required, just ""funny"" faces and gibberish...a great equalizer; it put everyone at a disadvantage. The plot, basic: caveman wants cavegirl, caveman plots to get cavegirl, caveman eventually gets cavegirl....but doesn't want her anymore. A few animated dinosaurs are tossed into the mix, easily proving to be the best part of this movie.Not a keeper."
1,It's not my type of comedies,"The picture quality is good.The people in this movie do not speak any language at all. They make some vocal sound but it's not English because it's supposed to happen long time ago. This does not bother me. I found very few funny moments in this film. Probably, it's not my type of comedies."
5,Great Fun,"Totally silly and hilarious movie. Starring some people you never thought would be in a movie together, such as Ringo Starr, Dennis Quaid and Shelly Long. I saw this movie originally as a kid and could'nt wait for it to arrive on DVD. Now that it's here it's now a family favorite. There are some scenes not appropriate for children but those are light and few."
1,Could not view it in my region,went into trash. thanks for nothing. Could not view it in my region. wasted money. wasted my time. Learned my lesson
5,Classic,This is another classic comedy! I have been looking for this movie and now I am the proud owner of it! A must for all comedy lovers!
3,interesting,A really weird movie. Ringo is not one of my favourite musicians but he has a little but of acting ability. If you like campy movies you'll like this one.
5,funny flick,ringo starr plays the leader of an inept band of cavemen that must survive against dinosaurs and another band of cavemen. the result is an hilarious movie.
3,Caveman,"This is a ""fun"" film, one that guarantees some laughs and guffaws, especially when you see a young Shelley Long and Dennis Quaid--in fact, they steal the show from Ringo."
1,This is a Stupid Movie,"The only reason anybody would watch this is to see Ringo. And maybe hope he'll sing in this. Instead of a good story, it's just stupid. If Ringo was not in it, then nobody would watch it. Even so, it's still a bad movie. All the characters grunt and make sounds that aren't really words. I didn't like Caveman at all and didn't think it was funny. Good cast like Shelley Long and Dennis Quaid, but the movie was really awful. I did not like this at all."
5,awsome,"I really don't know much about movies, but this is the first movie that i can remember watching as a kid. its funny, romantic, and dramatic all roled into one. the dialoug is minimal, but the creative use of everything that was avalible in the 1980's helps alot....definitly worth viewing!"
1,Keep This in a Cave!,"Ringo Starr plays a caveman called Atouk. His then future wife Barbara Bach plays his love interest, Lana. Shelley Long, pre-Cheers plays Lana's rival. They all speak in a fake language that consists of grunts and 12-15 words and a few English words, such as one swear. The most famous line was ""Atouk aloonda (sp) Lana,"" which is loosely translated as ""Atouk loves Lana."" Many people did not aloonda this lousy movie. If it wasn't for a Beatle, nobody would praise this film.The only reason people bothered with this movie is because Beatle Ringo was in it. The movie opens with the date October 9, 1 million B.C. October 9 was John Lennon's birthday. Not to offend Beatle fans, but this movie was on the same plane with the emperor's new clothes and nothing in the world could make it a good movie. The other one-STARR reviews say it well and one reviewer called it ""stinkarooey,"" which it is. Even the Beatle connection could not make this a good or funny movie."
3,Better The First Time,"I saw this movie one afternoon on TV several years ago. It was great seeing Ringo again. The movie has some funny moments but also drags at times. I bought CAVEMAN when it became available on DVD. I laughed a few times but it wasn't as funny as I remembered. The movie features Ringo, Shelly Long(Cheers) and Dennis Quaid. A few other familiar faces pop up during the movie. If you a Beatle fan or a Ringo fan, this movie belongs in your collection."
1,Don't buy this machine!,"I bought this karaoke machine (not through Amazon) and was dismayed at the low quality. The CD cover was very difficult to close, and would pop open at the slightest touch anywhere near it. The microphones did not work. The screen quality was poor. I ended up shipping it back to the place I bought it from (at my expense of $25!). My daughter (for whom it was a birthday gift) was very disappointed that her present had to be sent back."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I purchased this for a gift. Upon receiving it, the CD cover would not stay closed. Very flimsy and poorly made. I returned it for exchange. The second one arrived and the mics wouldn't work on it. I won't spend the money to exchange it again and have just decided to count my losses and find something better."
2,"Chronicle of the Cid [1883] by Robert Southey (General Books LLC, 1990)","CHRONICLE OF THE CID (1883) by Robert Southey, published by General Books LLC,2009. This edition is replete with spelling mistakes, missing or extraneous characters, and spacing errors. The publisher admits to using an inadequate software to ""keep the cost of the book as low as possible,"" and asks the reader to ""forgive"" the defects. Any reader can overlook a few typographical errors in a publication, but the plethora of mistakes in this edition are a distraction and take away the enjoyment of reading the text. The misspelled words especially make this publication inappropriate for students. As a teacher and author, I would not give anyone this book as a gift."
5,Very Best Album ever Made? One could make a Case...,"I first bought this Album back in the Spring of 1973, shortly after buying My first ever Record, The ""45"" Single ""Love Train"" which is included here. I will say, even at 11 Years Old, I had excellent Taste, this Album may be the best Recording EVER (Dorati's version of the Nutcracker is its only rival). So many emotions, great orchestration, powerful vocals, it's all here, every track is outstanding. Indeed, over the years I have grown to love the song ""Who am I"", that original flip side of ""Love Train"" more than ""Love Train"" itself..You must Buy this CD, absolutely and unwaveringly ESSENTIAL!!!!"
5,Flawless.,"If you own only one disc of 70's Philly Soul, this has got to be it. The title track is the best indictment of jealous, hating, two-faced devious people EVER WRITTEN, period. This magnificent piece of soul music is an astounding document of what can happen when true production genius (Kenny Gamble & Leon Huff) meets vocal, artistic brilliance (Walter Williams and a barely 30 year old Eddie LeVert) and the stars all align in their favor. This entire LP is indespensible and forever dispensed with the ""hits plus filler"" formula in R&B. ""(They Call Me) Mr. Lucky"" is an underappreciated gem that never gets it's props and ""Love Train"" is the type of song that defines the term 'anthem'. A Flawless Collection. This music hasn't aged a day in the 30 years since it's release."
1,False advertising ...,"Ok... so I am a visual guy and I assumed what the picture shows is what I am getting... they are showing 2 tapes, and I received one. (Many of the other competitors had 2-packs) So after being disappointed when the ""tape"" arrived I looked on the details description and it shows as one item, I was very very very annoyed to say the least. So be aware ... THEY ONLY SHIP ONE PIECE NOT TWO!"
3,a little disappointed,I bought these shoes for a vacation. When I recieved them I noticed there was a hole in top mesh of the shoe. I didn't have time to return them and wait for a new pair before my trip so I just repaired it myself with a little sewing. You should not have to repair a product when you buy it new! As far as the shoe goes they were cute and resonably comfortable.
4,Comfortable the First Time,"I wore these for the first time running around three different airports. They were extremely comfortable the first time I wore them, for many hours on my feet. The only problem I find with them is that there is no support and if you have feet on the flat side, as I do, you might want to order these in a half size larger and put inserts in for some support. Otherwise, they are great."
4,sketchers summer shoes,"I purchased women's whhite Sketchers Bikers-Sightseers. They are comfortable, fit well, and look sporty yet dressier than tennies. I haven't worn them enough to know how they last, but so far I am pleased.Service through Amazon was excellent."
4,Skechers bikers-sightsee,"i purchased these for my lady and she says they fit good and are very comfy,,"
3,"Comfortable, but smelly","I loved these shoes, but my boyfiend hates them. They are very comfortable and go with many things, but they did my feet smell too. I had to put the foot odor powder in them at least once every 3 or 4 wears and I had to wash them frequently. I wanted to buy a pair in black, but my boyfriend wouldn't let me."
5,Skechers,"These are the greatest! I have a lot of trouble finding comfortable shoes, and I walked all over Italy in these shoes without any discomfort at the end of the day. I have them in 2 different colors and I highly recommend them."
4,Quality survey of Tudor Stuart Britain,"Lockyer presents a readable survey of Tudor Stuart England that is accessible for moderate to advanced students of this time period. The narrative flows and is interspersed with qualifiable analysis and interpretation. Lockyer demonstrates his generous command of the time period, while keeping his work relevant to the student and not the most advanced scholar. However, the book could benefit from better presentation, including charts, graphs, and pictures. Also, as is typical in British History survey books, organization of topics isolate Ireland and Scotland into their own chapters. While this maintains a good narrative flow, it does damage to chronology. But then this is an on-going problem in the field. Finally, Wales is rarely considered at all. Despite these detractions, however, Lockyer pulls together one of the better surveys of this fascinating time period."
4,Solidly made toy.,"This sorter is simply beautiful and my little one loves it! The whole thing is made out of solid wood and the edges are very smooth. The push-down mechanism to get the blocks out is simple and cleverly designed. We began playing with it at around nine months and we still enjoy it at fifteen months.The one thing that keeps me from giving this sorter a perfect rating is that after some gnawing and mouthing of the blocks the color has become faded in areas. However, this still wouldn't keep me from buying the Shape and Sort again."
5,Love this toy,My daughter played with this sorter when she was 12 months and she still plays with it now- 6 months later.
2,Horrible book that created lasting memories,"This was pretty much the worst book I've ever read. My crewmate brought it along on a five week job in the woods and one by one, all five of us girls read it. The reason we all read it was because it was so horrible, and we made fun of it so much. We created some great lasting memories from that ^.^ . Otherwise, I would advise you not to read it unless you want to read some really bad porn."
3,Not her best,"I usually love Rebecca York's books, but I struggled to finish New Moon. Hopefully she'll get her groove back for the next one."
1,"Outdated, Useless","The productg is 15 years old and hopelessly out of date. Totally useless! There was no indication of this in the listing, and I expected a current issue."
5,What is going on?,Good information on what is really happening to our Country. Makes you wonder how we the people can let this go on.Young people should read this book. Heard Ms Swanson on Francis and Friends.
1,Defective,"The book has a printing defect.One chapter bound twice, another missing.Otherwise, OKNot worth a return/refund complication."
1,Wow,"Contrary to the comments in previous reviews, this book has zero research; it does, however, have plenty of speculation, poorly constructed theses, and a litany of non sequitors.Enjoy."
2,Good price....if it works!!,"Just got my Simpletech STI-UCF100 Compact Flash Memory card reader to use with my 256MB Viking card. Although the reader reads the contents of the card, transferring the data is another problem. This is supposed to be fast, like 1.5MB/sec or something. Rather it starts fast and then stalls for minutes, literally freezing up your computer. I've called tech support and they tried walking me through formatting my flash card, which I thought fixed the problem, until I tried again. Same problem happens. If you have to format your card everytime you want to download some pictures, what's the point? Anyways, will give it one more go before throwing in the towel. Wonder if the more expensive ones are any better?...."
2,defective,Mine arrived defective with a short circuit such that the LED flickered. It did not work as it should. I returned it. I think I will get another product.
1,Low price Low Quality,"this card is inexpensive i agree. The reason is that the card simply doesn't work. i have a canon powershot S40 and an HP 215,and it gave problem with both of them. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY"
4,Very Happy I Bought It,"I've never had a problem with this product. It works just as advertised. I have had things happen to the computer whereby it no longer recognized the reader (the green light went out), but by simply unplugging it and plugging it back in the computer recognized it again and it worked fine. I don't know if this is an issue with the device or Windows 98 SE, though. It works well with the SimpleTech 256 MB flash card I bought, as well as the little 8 MB Canon card that came with my camera."
3,Doesn't work with all cards...,"This reader works with my SanDisk 128mb card, but does not work with my newer Lexar Media 256mb 12x card. Go figure."
5,Cool new USB CompactFlash card reader,"Talk about convenient. This reader is very small, fits in your pocket and can even detatch from included cable, so you can plug it in to your USB hub or notebook like a key to transfer data to and from type I and II compactflash cards. Plus this reader is really fast and mass storage compliant, so no drivers needed if you have Windows 2000 or XP installed on your computer. If you have Win98, just load the included driver once and then you never need to load it again. This product is great and I recommend to anyone wanting to read and or write to compactflash cards."
5,Fast and convenience,"I have a PowerShot digital camera A300 from Canon. In order to download the pictures from the camera, I need to install 2 separate softwares, BUT, they do not work quite well. With this SimpleTech FlashLink CF Reader, I only need to connect it to the USB port and voila`, I can drag and drop pictures like an elementary schooler playing on the computer. I have Window 2000 OP."
4,"Easy and very effective, but sometimes unreliable","Overall, I've been very happy with the reader. So far I have only used it with Windows XP and 2000 and both operating systems were able to recognize it without the need to install additional drivers.This has been incredibly useful in that as a student, I have had the need to transport files back and forth between school and home. For me, floppy disks are unreliable and too small. CD-R's are generally too big for the amounts of data I generally have to transport. The CF Reader, however, is just the right size and highly portable.The only problem I have had is that sometimes Windows does not recognize that I have a card in the reader. Sometimes I have to have the card in the reader when I plug the reader in. Other times, I have to take the card out and put it back in the reader. Outside of this little inconvenience, the CF Reader has been an excellent tool."
3,doesn't work with Linux,"This claims to be ""mass storage compliant"", whatever that means.I'm still not sure what they mean by this, but it doesn't work withLinux. I'm taking mine back and getting a SanDisk model instead(people have got these working with Linux, check the reviews)"
1,Doesn't work,"Until today, I didn't replace any old hinge (total eight hinges) from the flip-top dining table yet. New hinges: Look the same on screen only; but when I received that, I knew that not exactly made by the same company. Quality not good as my old hinges. After installed (my experience, over 20 years furniture maker), when flip-up the side-table-portion is not leveling with the center-part, sloping down to the outside. Doesn't Work!!!...Sorry the five stars doesn't shine at all. One star is only for polite, I always did."
5,Shape Matching Toy,This is a great solid toy and challenges the user a bit more than toys that fit inside a whole. It is a good step up to identifying shapes.
3,Mediocre at best,"Look, Jerry Wexler and Dan Penn generally know what they're talking about, but this album is boring and lame. ""Purify""-- not even the same person who sang ""I'm Your Puppet"" but an impostor named Ben Moore -- has so much less emotional commitment than the singers Wexler compares him to like James Carr or Otis. Compared to their passion, this guy might as well be sleepwalking through these vocals. He even sings flat at some points on this album. I'm sure he's a great guy and Wex and Penn wanted to help him out, but don't buy this expecting a neo-soul gem like Solomon Burke or Al Green's comeback discs. I think it's ""better not to have it""."
4,Cute & Enjoyable Christmas CD,"This is a great Christmas CD and the Chipmunks did a great job! It has all the classical christmas songs that I enjoy listening during the holidays, including their classic hit - the Chipmunk Christmas song. However, the last track-the Chipmunk Song, i.e. an additional bonus track, does not really fit into the whole theme of the CD. The tune is kind of off key with the new add-ons and I was kind of disappointed. In comparison to the latest Chipmunk soundtrack of the 2007 movie however, they did a much better version of the Chipmunk song with a couple of remixes and they turned out to be very contemporary, upbeat; it truly shows the Chipmunks really have the groove and they continue to rock into the 21st century! Well, 24 songs out of 25 are good, so it is certainly worth it to get this CD."
5,My Kid's First Love,"Bond, James Bond. Say those words in my house and it's panic stations all around. This was the only book I could find on the James Bond movie series when they were little. It really is a well published book with over a hundred photographs with many in color. It is written with the younger reader in mind so it was just perfect. Timothy Dalton was just starting as James Bond so he's on the cover but it does cover each film up to ""The Living Daylights."" We still have it and read it (well, look at the pictures)."
1,"I love Conair products as a rule, but this is a mess!","WAY too heavy, takes too long to dry and doesn't seem to have the power of other Conair dryers I've owned. Am very unhappy with this product."
2,Don't bother,"I bought this dryer 3 weeks ago because my Blackbird finally gave out after 15 years. I'm so disappointed. The air-flow is weak so it takes forever to dry my shoulder-length hair. And it's very cumbersome and heavy. I gave this product two stars for the simple fact that it's cheap -- only $24. Not too bad if you have the patience. But, honestly, I wish I would have spent a few dollars more and got a better dryer."
3,Just OK,"I've actually had this dryer for a few years. It's okay. It does what it's supposed to do. Not too long after I got it, though, I noticed that the ""ion shine"" switch on the side was switched to off, so I turned it on to see what happened. I continued to dry my hair, and noticed a clicking sound. Looked at the dryer while it was on and saw sparks. Yes folks, sparks. Good thing I don't use a lot of styling products, or I could have had a serious problem on my hands. I still use it, with the ion shine switched off. It still dries my hair like any dryer would. But when it dies, I won't replace it with the same kind."
2,Where's the heat?,"I am disappointed in this dryer. Although the dryer I just threw out had holes melted into the attachable nozzle and was too hot, this one is not hot enough! It takes me almost twice as long to dry my hair. The hot setting is more like the warm setting on any other dryer I have used. I have used it for 3 days now and am going to return it."
1,what a bunch of garbage,"its a shame i wasted my money on this piece of $hit album. 1 word comes to mind while listening to this garbage POSERS. Take my advice and pass on this or else you will have an 11 dollar coaster for your drinks. If you want to hear what this band sounds like turn on any poser radio station or mtv and you'll hear a number of unoriginal bands... now times that by 20 and add the crap factor and you get ""5 posers ahead""."
1,Don't waste you money,If you are looking for the same old mtv cheese pop punk he is sooooo cute boyband stuff then this album is for you. Bands like 5 days ahead are a dime a dozen. if you want to hear them just turn on any bad pop punk song and behold 5 days ahead. Vocals are out of key. Guitars sound like cheese. Lyrics are imature. you hear the same 4 chords in just about every song. Don't wate your money 5 days ahead is not a beautiful and unique snowflake. cheers.
3,I'll wear it on occasion.......,"It may just be me, but this just didn't trip my trigger... it's not horrible, so I'm hoping it's just me and I'll get used to wearing it."
5,Great Scent,That is the second bottles I got for my gf and she loves it as well. This is one of the best perfume so far I discovered and for myself the best cologne is Vera Wang.
4,Eye of The Needle,This is an excellent vehicle for Donald Sutherland and it sticks to the book which is a classic thriller. It has very human characters and holds ones interest to the end.JGH
3,Good 70's thriller,"I rented this after having read the book, so my opinion is biased toward the excellent book. But this actually follows the book closely. The VHS quality was typically washed out somewhat, so the DVD would be a better experience. Donald Sutherland does a good job portraying the Nazi spy. The story is fast-paced and suspenseful. Another example of good suspensful, political/war thrillers from the 70s. While not on par with the book, it's a pretty good way to pass a couple hours."
1,Eye of the Needle Movie,"The movie came on time, but it can only be viewed in England. I don't know why they would sell it to an American. When I wrote to them, they said, basically, ""too bad. It was in the specs."" However, they suggested that I try it on my computer. Well, it worked, but the movie paused in the middle and wouldn't go any further. I wrote to them and sent the movie back. I have yet to hear from them. Be careful when you buy a movie that it plays in the States."
4,Eye of the Needle,"An excellent Donald Sutherland movie. The initial time sequences are a bit hard to follow, with a four year jump not made clear but otherwise a very good movie."
3,Choppy,Without reading the book first this would be impossible to follow. Good job by Sutherland. Differs slightly from the book.
3,For a movie ok,"The movie is good but like most movies it does not develope the characters. It was a nice try. It is a good suspense but I read the book first and that made the movie disappointing. The Needle is too one dimensional in the movie. Also, the MI-5 official is more critical to the story than the movie portrays. Also the book's ending ties it all together. It would be hard to put Ken Follet's books on screen unless they are miniseries."
2,"Melodramatic, inaccurate, and boring","What's the helicopter doing in a scene? There was no such thing at that time. As far as the deeper stuff, I think the child was exposed to events by his rather selfish, permiscuous, unprotective mother that would have warped him severely forever. Face it, the director didn't think the kid really mattered. I suppose that would be a sign of his own parenting views. The husband's death has a strong tie to the wife's infidelity. To summarize, I didn't identify with or like any characters and ideas presented here, and I lost interest pretty early. I guess the movie makes a presumption that these characters who flirt with death are so interesting (smile) that we'll just want to wallow in their tragedy. Think about the war, occupied Russia, Polland, etc. Hello? This is a two star movie at best. It's just over-acting and emoting BS."
2,A butchered classic,"I have read the book twice and it is just about the greatest ever, but the movie did it no justice. If you have only seen the movie, you probably have no idea who Godliman or Bloggs is because they were basically cut out of the movie. You can't just cut out 2 main characters. Plus, the movie spent way...WAY...to much time with the love triangle and not enough on the badass spy that is sneaking his way across the country. I wouldn't waste my time with the movie, just read the book.In the movie's defense though, I watched it with someone that had never read the book and she seemed to enjoy it."
2,Why should we care about these characters?,"I think Eye of the Needle, at least as the film tells the story, suffers from a common problem I have seen in a lot of ""action thrillers"": poor character development. Why should we care about these characters one way or the other? Instead we have a modicum of action and violence, a dose of beautiful ocean scenery, and lovemaking. There was not much complexity or discernment in any of the characters. Donald Sutherland simply looks depressed, as a serious actor might be if he found himself wasting his time making a bad film.Alfred Hitchcock did a much better film along the same lines with ""The 39 Steps""."
1,DVD from the wrong country,This DVD would not play on any of our DVD players because it's from region 2 (Europe). We went in to our settings on our computer and changed the country to Sweden so we could view the DVD.......ridiculous!!!!!
1,eye of the needle,disc would not play on standard dvd formate. must be developed for european or some other use other third world country
5,Let the weirdness continue,I love surreal comedy and adult swim definitely delivers. This show is so bizarre your friends will watch an episode tell you you're strange then ask you to put the next episode on. the animation style is like a demented where's Waldo. Love it
1,HORRIBLY HANDLED!,"MADE IN MEXICO!Cellophane wrapping is melted onto the spine of the case!This case is one of those recycle cases where they punch out a giant recycle symbol on both sides of the case!My DVD arrived smashed in with serious dents into the plastic cover, and the cover page inside was ripped!After going through the whole DVD you'll feel like it was mostly about the band Cheese Burger and not Superjail!Titmouse studios ruined this show!"
4,Crazy Show,This is an awesome show from Adult Swim. If you enjoy crazy twisted blood and guts filled shows similar to the likes of The Ren & Stimpy Show you will love these short but entertaining 15min episodes.
5,Covers the basics well,"This book forms a good framework for advanced learning. Some of the training methods were new to me, some were not. Overall, it was very helpful."
4,Obsolete but a good read,"As long as you realize what you are buying this is a very good book. The training information is mostly dated (including advice like don't drink water for at least a half hour after your workout so that the body has ""time to cool down"") but there are some nice gems for warmups and drills that I've worked into my classes. But I liked this book because it provided a great insight into the Judo mindset of a few decades ago. The authors are very honest and earnest in their desire to share their expertise and it makes for an engaging read of what could be a dry subject.Overall I'd compare this to reading a book about Football from the 1960s - a lot of the specific info is obsolete but there is still a lot to learn and even more to gain from seeing the perspectives of a prior generation. I wouldn't recommend this book for a beginner, but this is a great addition to the bookshelf of any senior Judoka or instructor."
1,Misleading and out of date,"I found this book, the way it was described on the Amazon website to be misleading and out of date. Although the publish date says 1999...in fact the book is a redo of a much older work that must have been published before. The book offers nothing at all new to any serious Judo instructor."
1,Scary,"This book is severely dated. Several advances have been made in the area of sports specific training. Some of these excercises are down right dangerous. Serious injuries could result. There are some good stretching suggestions, but a beginner's weight-lifting book has safe excercises, for those looking to incorporate weight training with their judo practice."
1,Handbook,"Very disappointed. I thought this book would provide a little insight to Lutheranism. Instead it gave instructions on how to sit in church, what to take to a potluck and all kinds of other nearly worthless information."
5,The Lutheran Hankbook,"The Lutheran Hankbook is a delightful, humorous guide to the way things are done in the Lutheran Church. An example is what to bring to a potluck which most Lutheran Churches have fairly frequently. This book also explains many of our customs and beliefs, plus explaining much of our history. This informative book is one I will enjoy for many years. It would be an excellent gift to anyone joining the church, no matter what age."
5,Good Book,This humorous and informative book is a must have for any Lutheran. It is interesting and funny. I read it over and over
4,My daughter loves it!,We ordered this for our 3 1/2 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!! It's a tiny bit too big but when you adjust the straps it stays on perfectly. She will be able to use this for awhile. I would definitely recommend this product.
4,My daughter loves it!,My daughter was so excited about getting her new helmet! She doesn't complain about it at all in regards to how it fits...it is a little bit big but it's okay.
3,Does not fit head well,"We purchased this helmet for our daughter's 5th birthday. She also loves all things pink and princess and already had a princess 12"" bike. The helmet seems like good quality and has staps that adjust under the chin and along the sides of the head. OUr daughter has always had a rather ""large"" head, so we were surprised that this helmet wobbles all over the place, no matter how we adjust the straps. It constantly falls over her eyes or to the back of her head. I can't imagine this is keeping her head very safe if she were to fall. It aggravates her and she wants to take it off a lot. I think there should be adjustable straps inside this helmet like there are inside the toddler helmet of the same design."
5,"Cute, safe, stylish helmet","If the child in life loves Disney Princesses and skating/rollerblading/biking/other activity requiring headgear, then this is a great helmet. It's sure to meet with your child's approval, is reasonably priced, and pretty cute."
2,Shipped short parts,"According to the add on Amazon ""processing takes 4-5 days"" but it took two and a half weeks for my order to ship from LA to San Jose. After I received my shipment i discovered it was missing the rails. It took 3 attempts to get through to customer service to get an answer and their response was that the item did not include the rails. So, even though they say they are selling a ""bed"", they are actually just selling a headboard and footboard (if you read the fine print way at the bottom it says rails and night stand sold separately). To make it even worse, they don't even sell the matching solid wood rails that go with the bed, you have to buy the cheap metal ones, so even if you wanted to make a complete matching bed you cannot.BE VERY CAREFUL ORDERING FROM THIS VENDOR. They have a lot of verbage on their site indicating they care about your cutomer satisfaction but my experience is that they really just want to make a buck."
1,Poorly written...,"I got this book for my young teenage daughter who enjoyed the Princess Diaries books & was looking for similar ""fluffy"" teen books. Both she & I found this book impossible to read beyond the first chapter because the quality of the writing was so poor that it was distracting. Boring, too. Instead of this book, my daughter would recommend The Princess Bride (Goldman) and more Meg Cabot books such as All American Girl and the Mediator series (book #1 is Shadowland)."
2,It's Izzie's Turn in book 2,"This is the second book in the series and it hasn't gotten any better. This book continues shortly after the first but is from Izzie's point of view and not Lucy's.Continuing to mimic the Georgia Nicholson books of Louise Rennison, we now have Angus and the whole drama of what it means when a boy says he will call you later.Although this is supposed to be from another point of view, it reads just like Lucy's did in the first book. It is not convincing that it is a different voice (although the scenery has changed).I have to say that this one was even blander than the first book. At least Lucy's angst was more believable. Izzie really has no issues in this book (other than when will her guy call), so although longer than the first, it has less to the story.For laughter, stick with Rennison, as this one will not even crack a smile."
1,"mates, and dates, and tres boring lives","god, this book is soo boring. I really love reading and i hardly ever stop a book in the middle but this one goes so slow. If people are looking for funny quick reads then check out the Georgia series by rennison. If there are people out there who are not great at reading and looking for something to waste time with then go to this series."
2,Not that good...,"Title says it all. However, that is juust my opibion. Read it to find out if you like it/or not.Kind of like On the Bright Side... which was a better book."
3,Character Voices?,"Overall, I think this is as funny as or funnier than the first book Mates Dates and Inflatable Bras. This book is told through Izzie's point of view, which is slightly different than Lucy. The only complaint is that Lucy and Izzie don't have different voices. They both seemed like the same character until someone in the book says her name.This book Mates Dates and Cosmic Kisses is either a strong three star or a weak four star. I decided to give it a three star because of the character's voice problems. But I thought that everything else was very good, and I had a good laugh"
5,Love it,my girls love this doll. I bought it for them when they were a year or two and now they are in elementary and still play with it. I got it because they love the madeline stories. I did not want to get them the lifelike dolls because frankly they are a little creepy. I like stuff without batteries. this is a great gift for any girl!
2,Too thin...and a quick chew.,"A bit of disappointment in this bully stick due to lack of thickness. Product Description is: 12"" Select Bully Sticks - Pkg of 50. Select Bully Sticks are thicker and heavier than standard Bully Sticks.My 9 month golden retriever, who has spent a day or more on a competitor's 0.75"" diameter bully sticks, tore through the first K-nine Kountry stick in ~15 minutes. They are obviously very tasty to the dog, but they stunk up the house upon opening the bag (which we now keep out in the garage)Either K-nine Kountry sent me the wrong product or my expectations are out of whack. A majority of the sticks average 3/8"" or less in diameter. I counted 6 of the 50 sticks that were 1/2"" to 3/4"" in diameter. Personally, I can't imagine a bully stick getting any thinner than a majority of what I received, so the idea that they are ""Select"" is what concerns me."
5,"Must have for any tarot reader, shamanic practioner, or other Oracle cards","I have been a practicing tarot reader for many years and have an extensive collection of tarot, oracle, and angel cards. This set is truly magnificant! You do not have to be a shamanic practioner to appreciate and experience the magical abilities of these cards. They are truly as powerful as any set of tarot and really get to the core issues of the person you are reading. Anyone who is skittish about a tarot reading based on fear of ""the devil"" will be put at ease with these cards. Truly no one can interpret these cards as being bad, from the devil, or against their religious beliefs. Please note the pictures on the cards are drawn pictures and not photographs. But truly these are wonderful cards."
4,Could have been better,"the cards do ring true with me. and I believe I will be able to help others with them. But there is just one thing that I wish the creator would have done, since real animals were being used, why not have real photos of each animal. The cards are a mix of real photos and drawings. The drawings were okay, but since I have a wolf guide, I could not wait to see his photo and Keekee was not happy. it was a drawing and not as beautiful as I have seen.so I would still recommend this for someone wanting to work with animals, but there are other decks out there that are more entrancing with the animals."
5,spirit cards,THE CARDS ARRIVED QUICKLY AND ARE LOVELY. I HAVE NOT USED THEM VERY MUCH BUT I KNOW THIS TYPE OF CARD DOES GIVE YOU INFORMATION TO REFLECT ON. THANK YOU AMAZON.
3,Integrability conditions discussed,"Written in a attractive and even seductive way, relying more on Lie algebraic language than is typical, this book is probably as stimulating an intro. to modern geometry as you can find, within certain limits. The section on noncoordinate bases might have been more clearly written, however. Frobenius's theorm is discussed, something that Fomenko et al should have covered, and the section on connections can be worked throuigh independently of the heavy machinery of exterior differential forms, which is attractive for physics students."
3,"too much stuff, too little time to explain","This book is only readable AFTER you have read Schutz ""Introduction to general relativity"", the latter is a much better book.One key flaw is that the author tries to cover lots of stuff in very little space, which requires read to take leap of faith. Lie group and Lie algebra are not covered well in this book.""Tensor Analysis on Manifold"" is a good alternative on differential geometry, but the fonts are too small."
5,Powerful Movie,"This is one of my wife's favorite movies, and for a good reason! Well worth purchasing versus renting in this care."
5,Most Overlooked Film of 1980's,"Surprisingly, this is not only the most overlooked film of the 1980's because of it's quality, but also because it is a Speilberg film! Christian Bale's introductory performance is genius, bolstered by great characters played by Joey Pants and Malkovitch.I first saw this in the theater when I was 14, and it hit me pretty hard. I'm so happy to have this film on DVD, I only wish there was more special features on the disc. Oh well."
5,beautiful film,"I absolutely love this film. It is one of Spielberg's finest. Christian Bale's performance is one of the best I have seen. Empire of the Sun gives a view of WWII that is rarely seen- the prison camps in China. John Williams did a wonderful job with the score, and the performance of the song ""Suo Gan"" in the film is simply beautiful. Even the artwork from the video's cover is gorgeous. I can honestly say I quote lines from this movie at least every other day. I own a copy of the film, a copy of the novel, and two copies of the soundtrack. I highly recommend all of them."
5,Fantastic movie,This is another Spielberg gem. The acting and scenery is unbelievable. The quality of the shooting is fantastic. I highly recommend this epic.
2,Confusing movie,"The actors act very well, but the boy's behaviors and lots of scenes are cnfusing in the movie. I do not recommend it to anyone."
3,If Spielberg's name were not on it it would be forgotten,"I looked forward because I heard this was a great movie. It is NOT a great movie. It is a collage of scenes that are not even in logical sequence...there is no point to the story really...The ususal Spielberg special effects are good, but, damn, a good story that made sense would have been a lot better...."
1,Disappointing!,"Poor quality of DVD. Very limited information on the length of the special features, and impossible to navigate inside the special features--no matter what one selects, it plays the entire ""special features"", which is almost 30 minutes. The script, even though written by Tom Stoppard, is fragmented and inconsistent, failing to bring out the theme of the story as told in the book."
1,Amazing amount of talent down the drain.,"It bugs me when all of the resources that went into making this movie went into making a contrived, unreal, banal, obvious mess. There's a terrific story by J G Ballard in the middle of this movie and Spielberg missed it. Instead he pasted together a bunch of flat movie cliches. Then got Tom Stoppard to write the script. Got Malkovitch to overact, probably not that hard, actually, and got John Williams to roll out the heavenly choirs, the tense percussion, I'm sure the whole lot of them know that this movie is a sell out, and feel a little nauseous whenever they remember what they did here. An amazing amount of talent down the drain. A shame."
5,Deeper than one may expect,"If you'd like an entertainig WW2 movie - watch Pearl Harbor. Steven spielberg, who was successful at only entertaining movies, has made a multilayered movie which has you thinking about it long after watching it.The movie is based on the true life story of James Graham, a British boy who was stranded, parentless, in Shanghai when the Japanese took over the city, & managed to survive in a POW camp until the war was over, in crcumastances many of the grown ups had a hard time surviving."
5,A missed gem!!!,"Every bit as good as ""Saving Private Ryan"" but on a more intimate level. Christian Bale should have won an Oscar for his remarkable film debut. John Williams's score is one of his best ever, too. The rooftop scene (P-51!! Cadillac of the skies!!) is as powerful as any ever filmed. Parents should watch this one with their kids!!!"
2,Horrible adaption of a great novel,"The novel Empire of the Sun by J.G. Ballard is considered by some the best British novel ever made about WWII. Spielberg's film does not capture the heart of the novel whatsoever. The novel, which is about spritual decay, has been replaced by a trite coming of age story. The narration is sloppy and unengaging and the score makes me want to vomit. The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because the film looks wonderful. Spielberg proves that he can make any seen look beautiful, but the story is not worth watching."
3,Not His Best Stuff,"Okay, so it's a Steven Spielburg movie, which means it's a given there was talent involved. That said, I found this movie to be nothing more than okay. In a way, the entire thing was sureal, which though maybe intentional, made it hard for me to attach myself to the film or its characters. The last 20 minutes was good, but it took a while to get there."
2,Confused with little continuity,"This is good filmmaking, but awful story-telling. At 90 minutes into this I was checking my watch, wondering when it would start getting to a point. Then it ended. I guess it had no point.The actor playing Jamie is the only thing holding this movie together. I hope he got a director's share and a producer's share in the profits, because without him this would have been ""Reds"" or ""Ishtar"" or the directors cut of ""Brazil""-- an epically long movie without any epic story to tell..."
4,classic,good classic family movie - lesson to be learned is that we're fools if we dont think this could happen in America.
5,Empire of the Sun,"This film is, in my opinion, one of Spielburgs best- the true story is moving and heartfelt-- in my top 20 fav' films. Christian Bale is phenomenal!!!!"
3,One-off,"This is an odd one from Spielberg, one of his few serious films from the eighties, and different in tone and look from all his others, before or since. It features some haunting images, and includes one of John Malkovich's best performances. It is largely depressing, but with moments of black comedy and hope. Nevertheless, I found it to be rather rambling and melodramatic in places, with curious unnecessary bits, and burdened with too many competing symbols."
1,Empire of the Sun,"One of the few DVD's I truly regret buying. This film is full of overacting, poorly integrated scenes that have little or no apparent connection to each other, and an annoying misty quality to the cinematography. It is a prime example of the strategy that if you can't make a good, small film, make a long film with lots of extras. It is amazing to me that anyone would have invested money to make this film."
1,not uplifting or enthralling,"Story of a rather pathetic, unprepared, and unrealistic family. Not a heroic survival tale. More of a stumble and fumble along barely surviving on luck. No smart witty survival skills. Just a blind chaotic nightmare."
1,What a Colossal.........waste of time.,Steven Spielberg really gets carried away with himself here. I get left with nothing.Could anything be more boring than this?
1,PROOF OF SPIELBEGERIAN MEDIOCRITY,This film will teach you what it mean for a director tohave technical talent but have no redeming ability get withinmiles of brining an iota emphaty or warmth to HUMANS on film.The movie tries for heartfelt but it is stuck in theEDDIE HASKELL universe of false emotions and overbearingness.If you want a hearfelt story about a kid growing up in a wartry THE TIN DRUM.
1,BORING,"This movie was quite possibly the worst WWII movie I have ever seen. It had no conflict, and quite frankly, it was very BORING."
1,Oha ... another Spielberg,"One of the worst movies ever ... unconvincing and exhaustively boring. Spielberg's brilliant at popcorn movies like ""Back to the future"" and ""The Duel"", the rest (seen ""AI""?!) is shallow at best ... i still wonder how he managed to NOT completely ruin ""Schindler's List""??"
5,Excellent movie for history's sake...,A boy gets seperated from his parents and has to learn to survive in an occupied China. There are a lot of poingnant scenes. Christian Bale does an excellent job developing such a deep character at such a young age. A great family movie.*small bit of trivia* A young Ben Stiller plays a part in this movie.
4,Vastly Underrated,"A grand, sweeping film of epic proportions, this stands the test of time in more ways than most films do. Christian Bale gives us a sneak peak at his extraordinary presence as an actor, something he did not really realize again until the release of ""American Psycho"" in 2000. ""Empire"" is a Hallmark Card to lost innocence and childhood, which few directors can do with the grace and style that Speilberg offers. The landscape is powerful, the tale of loss heart wrenching, but more than anything, the scenes where the boy Bale is separated from his parents will keep the viewer glued. Critics often lambasted this film for its length and violence, yet without these, it's less effective. In truth, ""Empire of the Sun"" deserves renewed respect. It's that good. An essential DVD in my mind, and one I purchased the day it was released!"
5,Empire of the Sun,"Excellent movie! Christian Bale is wonderful as Jim, a young Briton forced to spend four years in a Japanese internment camp after he is separated from his parents. John Williams' score is magnificant, and Steven Spielberg delivers his usual top-notch directing job."
4,Beautiful film by Spielberg and Co.,How did this one slip through the cracks? A beautiful film with great acting and accompanying soundtrack. You can see from this film why Christian Bale is now so highly regarded as one of our best actors today. Has it really been 20 years? Excellent imagery!
3,"A Moviie, Empire of the Sun,",This was a very difficult movie to understand. Have to watch carefully until the very end to realize what it's about.
3,LIKE IT!,I've seen this movie two times and i find it little bit slow but very moving and interesting.
1,"Simplistic, crap","If you like viewing the world of the past through the reflection upon a silver spoon that is imbedded into a tight dark place within an upper crust Englishman well then, THIS IS YOUR FILM!!!"
5,Better than I expected,I received this DVD in 2 days and paid for standard shipping. It was released in the 80's so I wasnt sure how the quality would beon DVD. Quality is fine. I am enjoying the movie!
5,Excellent transfer to DVD,"Great movie & fantastic transfer to DVD. The picture is sharp and clear and the colors are rich and accurate. The sound is also quite good. The widescreen format has been enhanced for large screen TVs, so the film fills most of the screen area. 'Empire of the Sun' looked quite good on my 46-inch LCD high definition TV, played on my Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player. Highly recommended film to watch again and again with the family."
4,Very moving film about the loss of innocence,"When I saw this movie as a kid, I didn't really care for it much. Now, I've seen this movie at least six more times, and it has grown on me. The film contains a very compelling story about a young British boy who soon finds himself alone when the Japanese take over Shanghai during World War II. His life changes completely when he, along with some of his brand new adult friends, is taken to an internment camp. The boy (played fantastically by a young Christian Bale) goes through some incredible changes in his life, and this is where the story becomes very intriguing.I'm not really a fan of Spielberg, but this film is just one of his few films that I truly admire. It has a solid performance by Bale, a stellar supporting cast, some beautiful music, realistic sets, and breathtaking cinematography. It's a very good film, and it deserves its recognition among the general public.Grade: 8.5/10"
5,A nearly forgotten classic,"To me this movie really spells out what Spielberg sees in WW2, it gives meaning to all the other movies he's made focusing on the period. It's really about the loss of innocence, and the whole movie is a bizarre voyage, and the slight post-apocalyptic feel is very nice as well. If you've watched the trailer and if it looks even remotely interesting to you, chances are you wont be disappointed."
5,Good Buy,"I purchsed this ring for my mother from amazon after researching lot in stores and internet. We knew how much 0.10 ctw diamond look like. So we received what we expected. The ring is awesome. It is as described with very good cut, SI2, H-I shiny diamond though it is just 0.10 but color , clarity and cut makes it different. Gold quality is fair and metal is sturdy with 3.4gm of weight. I have gained fair knowledge in diamond jewellery selection, i would say that this ring is true value for money. My mother just loved it."
1,Kerfoot takes one in the pooper!,"As if it couldn't get any worse, John Kerfoot delightfuly screws himself. The direction in this movie obviously shows what a talentless hack John really is. Genius no, hypocrite yes. Where do I see John in the next ten years, making the third installment of the Charlie's Angels franchise. Oh well it could be worse, he could be michael merriweather."
3,Nice product but was delivered wrong size,I ordered a 12x15 bag for my husbands birthday but was delivered a larger size bag. Now I need to return it. Bummer that he opened the bag to find the wrong size bag. Besides getting the wrong size I'm happy with the product. My husband has used these tuxedo bags for years and they are very durable and sturdy. I give the actual bag 5 stars because its very nice but i give the company 2 stars for the size mixup... It was delivered quickly though. Left a total of 3 stars just because of the whole experience and I'm annoyed that I have to return the product and wait to get another now.
4,outstanding,"After being diagnosed and in denial for awhile about the disease, this was the 3rd book i began reading to help myself understand my body and what was happening to it. This book put a lot of things into perspective and began to shed some light on the disease and what I needed to do get control of it. This is the book that my friends need to read so that they can also understand what I am going thru."
5,Very Helpful,"Living with this disease is painful. This book gave me more insight than I had before. Each chapter was helpful.I've done a lot of research on Endo, and this book condensed it to make it easier for one to understand it easier. It helped mentally and physically."
2,"Encouraging and Empowering, but Not Very Educational","This might be a good book if you know absolutely nothing about endometriosis or if you have very few coping skills. It has a basic introduction to the disease and gives very general advise on how to cope. Most of us who have had endo for a long time already have these coping skills. For a more complete reference I highly recommend the Endometriosis Sourcebook by Mary Lou Ballweg. The Sourcebook was published in 1995, but it is still the most complete and update reference on endo I have found."
2,Slo-o-o-w,"This is now the third of the Talba Wallis series. I like Julie Smith - especially Skip Langdon series, also set in New Orleans, and the Rebecca Schwartz series.That's why I've kept up with Talba Wallis books but I find P. I. on a Hot Tin Roof to be a marginally interesting book. The threads of the story have promise but seem to get mired down in detail, complicated by Talba's other life as a poetess, writing/reading as ""Baroness de Pontalba"". In all, I found this book to be a slow, rather stilted effort, in which the ""mystery"" almost is lost in all the attempts at portraying the idiocyncratic behavior of the multitude of characters, none of whom comes across with much force or depth. Maybe it's what seems to me to the self-consciousness of a white woman trying to write in a young black woman's voice. It's an OK read but I wouldn't put it at the top of your list."
4,Great little dino figure!,Small but very nicely detailed for the price. I bought a couple to serve as prey for my prehistoric carnivores. Seems fairly durable and would withstand 'moderate' play by children.
2,"Looks nice, but useless","Sure, it looks nice, and wipes clean. However, it is completely porous - anything liquid that lands on it will filter through to the table underneath, making a nice basketweave patten on your table. Kind of defeats the point of a placemat. You have to pick up the placemate, wipe it (on both sides, since everything goes through it) and then wipe the table."
1,should not sell products in that condition,"i have already given my review ion this product,the product was horrible quality, the cheri liquor filling was completely dry! I wonder how old it was.I will never order again form this place, a store that sells fresh and good quality food would have never sent those boxes"
2,Candy shop has flaws but they try to do something about it,"After having received a first order of Mon Cheri in a very bad condition, the Candy shop tried to make up for it with a second sending. I appreciated that. In general they should not send the chocolates at room temperature, since the chocolates melt and the liquor leaks all over the box. Although not happy in the beginning, they at least tried to repare it, which is not always the case with other sellers.Rudolf, Augusta, GA"
4,good little iten,"Hurts at first; pain bearable though. Did have some ingrown hairs at first. Now, the little hair that grows back is very fine, not coarse."
4,No more fuzz,"I purchased the Epi Slim to get rid of the facial hair that seem to be increasing by the day since I turned 40, it works great! I can now wear my mineral makeup or creme makeup without the embarassing fuzzy look. I tried it on my bikini but the pain was to much. I gave this product 4 stars because of the pain factor."
3,does not epilate well,"i thought it would be good. i tried using it on my bikini area. it did not epilate well. had to run the unit several times over the area to take out the hair. when my patience ran out, i just took a tweezor and tweezed the hair that were left."
3,Nice and handy tool :),"this is the first time i try using an epilator, it was quite scary at my first use, but i am getting used to it now :)it works fine for my underarm but it not really good at removing real short hair. i tried once on my bikini but ouch, it's so painful and now i just use it for my underarm =)"
3,ok,its super painful!!! but i must say it does get the job done... im sticking to waxing though...this hurts too much!!
5,"Love, love, love it!","Was looking at much more expensive items before finding this. Had used hot wax (and burned skin), hot sugar products (and burned skin), sticky tapes that irritated skin terribly, and was very frustrated with facial hair growth. The long slow process of individual tweezing was miserable. This hair growth in menopause was the bane of my existance, but getting the Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Hair Remover has been an answer to prayer! It does hit skin now and then and feel slight discomfort but overall, it's fast, it's efficient, it pulls hair out by roots so no rough stubble grow back like from shaving or rubbing off hair removal means. It's wonderful! Am loving it and will buy a second just to make sure if anything happens to the one, that I have a backup and I hope they never discontinue such a wonderful product."
3,Emjoi AP-9LC Epi Slim Compact Epilator,"Not as good as the full-size, rechargable Gold Caress. This one vibrates too fast and bounces off the skin."
1,Doesn't work very well,I bought this to use on facial hair due to PCOS and hirituism. It was much to painful for my upper lip (more pain over a longer period of time and less effective than waxing). The pain for my chin area was much more tolerable and it worked great the first time but not when the hair grew back. I would see the hair in the mirror and try to get the epilator to grab them but it wouldn't. I finally gave up and used a tweezer. This is supposed to grab hair long enough for tweezing but it didn't. It really only worked on long fine hair in non-sensitive places.
1,Not a tweezer.,"The size is pratical, but instead of pulling out the hair from the root, it just cuts them. One or two hair do get pulled out, but the rest are just there. It is cheap, but not worth it, buy a shaver instead."
5,great,i used this product over a week ago and i haven't had any hair grow back yet. just put onto skin very slightly and it does the trick.
3,It's ok for the price,"It's okay for the price. It doesn't remove hair as well as some of the other better brands but it does remove hair. It will just take longer and you'll have to be patient and go over each area multiple times. It took me two days to treat one area, first day I got a lot of hair but became sore, waited until the next day and finished the residual hairs. Also, it has a tendency to break hairs instead of pulling them out by the root. Overall I'd recommend this as a back up, like for traveling or touching up, etc... but not for a first time user."
5,Good hair remover,I had another emjoi tat was pretty much worn out and this one is better. Small enough to get facial hair around corners.
3,Does not remove my facial hair,"It does nto remove the small soft hairs on my face and upper lip. It removes SOME but not enough to make a difference. I had more luck with buying wax strips. HOWEVER, it DOES remove underarm hair and hair between the eye brow area, which still makes it useful. I hate shaving underarms and now I don't have to anymore!"
5,First time epilator user,"Used the epilator on my upper lip and it worked swimmingly! It did take me a few tries to get it right though. Just know that if you don't feel a sting/pain, it's not working correctly. Highly recommend for upper lip! Will try underarms next! :)"
3,not what I hoped for,"I originally saw this on a low-quality youtube video, where a girl was using it on her legs and face(so I thought). After buying this product, I realize that girl in the video did not have this device turned on, and had very likely never really used it. When I turned on this device it was unexpectingly loud, and quite intimidating. I used it on some fine hairs on my hands and it did a good job plucking them. I tried on my forehead where I had a few thin white hairs. It didn't hurt as bad as I expected, and then about a week later they were grown back and thicker, it was then I realized it wasn't plucking but breaking them. I have since stopped using it. For certain areas of the body(mainly legs or arms) I could see this product working for someone. It all really depends on your type of hair. On long, thick hairs, I found it would usually cause the device to come to a halt, then finally yank or break the hair(I speculate this will eventually burn the motor up)."
4,Works well,"Works well, but it does sting a bit, especially in more sensitive areas like the upper lip. Still, it's a good alternative to plucking with tweezers."
1,Cheap Item,"This product is cheap. It hardly takes out any hair, and when it does it's sporadic. I would recommend spending the extra money to get an epilator that will actually work."
1,Not Worth It,"This product was a complete waste of my time and money. Was supposed to be less painful than plucking or tweezing, but instead just made a horrible buzzing sound and did nothing."
3,Good for underarms,Works well on a week's growth of hair..great price ...Only complaint is that it is quite noisy...Recommend using talc before using it on underarms to minimize painLink : [...]
4,It meets my needs,"I use this item to pluck out my unwanted chin hairs. Although it took me a time or two to learn to use it well, I now really enjoy not having to search in the mirror for those wayward hairs, just use the epilator back and forth both directions for a minute or so and I am hair-free for another couple of weeks... lasts much longer than regular plucking, and almost no pain or effort."
4,Good for travel,"I was almost tempted to return this product because it did not have the same power as my corded emjoi epilator. However, when I used it on my face, I changed my mind and decided to keep this unit for travel purposes. It's definetly not a replacement for your existing corded unit but for travel and supplemental uses, and for the price, this unit is a good addition. It works best on the face and bikini lines, not as well on the legs or underarms but in a pinch, it will do. The tweezer area is small but not small enough to be used in the eyebrow area. I belive emjoi makes yet another unit for that application. It is nice to have the convenience of a cordless unit but since this is designed for such small areas it's not practical for your legs. Quick touchups are fine but count on another unit if you are going to be needing more power to do larger areas."
4,It's ok.,"I believe this device can really work, but I have a little problem with it - it's speed. It's too fast and powerful, and hurts when it pulls a hair. I'm not using it much because of that. I wanted to give it 3 stars, but then added one, - it does pull hair, it's just uncomfortable for me!"
1,This product does not work.,I used it on my facial hair and It did not work. It didn't pick up even the thin hairs on my upper lip and forget the coarse hairs.
1,Very Meh,Maybe I need to wait for the hair to be longer? It doesn't really work well so far...My friend swore up and down about how great this worked and I'm disappointed so far.
2,DOA,"A none working unit was delivered. Amazon made it an easy return, did not even have to make out a label ~ cost free return shipping ~ UPS pickup at the door ~ immediate refund on return. For replacement, I decided to order the Emjoi Divine, having 36 tweezer discs, 2 speeds, and costing just a couple dollars more."
2,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I'm not really too happy with this product. It gets the job done, I guess, but it's sooo painful. It takes a long time to get one hair out. You have to make sure you pull your skin very tight with this one because it will pinch it! I was hoping this would be easy to travel with and use on sensitive areas but I've only used it a couple of times, I would rather just use a bigger one. I didn't even take it with me when I traveled. Just took my bigger one. I would not recommend this product!"
1,Total waste of money!,"There were just enough semi-positive reviews for this that I broke down and purchased one. Don't do it! Total waste of money. It doesn't even the touch coarser hairs and breaks the others. Tweezing or waxing is much better. As others have mentioned, it is really noisy too!"
4,It was okay!,"It is a very good item I do like it, but of course it's like using an eyebrow plucker of course it's going to hurt like that. Over all though it works it's at a great price compared to others like it and I do prefer it over my razor..."
2,Causes ingrown hairs,"I tried using this on my face and a few days later had a lot of ingrown hairs so I won't use it on my face again. I used it on my underarms and got pretty good results, but I had to use it a couple of times before I got everything and I still had to tweeze a few strays. It works on my legs, but it's so small that it would take way too long to make it worthwhile. All in all I guess it does what it says it will do, but my face doesn't like it and it's too small for my legs so it will be a limited-use product for me. (Plus it hurts like the dickens!)"
1,Disappointed...,"I'm very disappointed with this product. I read reviews and hoped it would work great for me since I have thick, coarse hair. All it did was rip the hairs! It didn't even rip it OUT at the roots. I had to immediately go back and pluck everything it missed because it was becoming itchy from the stubs it created. This did not work on the bikini or under arm area for me."
1,maybe im not using it right?,"ive used this product maybe twice since i bought it. i dont really like it. ive read the directions and am following them the best i can but it just isnt working for me. i find it doesnt get all of the hair from my upper lip and that if you use it for a LITTLE while the metal part that pulls the hair gets very hot and burns. then again, maybe im not using it right, this is my first epilator."
2,Buy the Emjoi A-18. Not this.,"I bough the Emjoi A-18 before I purchased this. I have coarse hair and it pulled it out with no problem. Only if you are in a jam and desperately need something, anything to pluck your hair out then I would suggest using the AP-9L. You have to go over the same area so many times with the AP-9L that it leaves what looks like razor burns. Buy the Emjoi A-18."
1,Emjoi AP-9LC Epi Slim Compact Epilator,This product does not do what it advertises. Does not work at all on my facial hair
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought this product recently and if I still had the packaging I would return asap for my money back! Ended up going back to tweezing and waxing to get the job done as using this was as effective as going over my face hairs with a regular comb! Loud, clumsy and ineffective. Searching for a new product and hope I can get it right this time."
1,Not for your face,I purchased this product expecting it will remove my facial hair and no bad effects since it's specifically a facial epilator. So I cleaned my face before using it. Warning it reallllly hurt! Yes it does remove hair but not the smallest one. So while using it I notice some redness but I continued thinking it would be mild reaction and then next morning I noticed a lot of red bumps on my face (most on cheeks)!! I was really pissed and it took 2 weeks to disappear and some left scar. I wasted my money and I will never use this product again.
1,Painful,"Very painful. I followed the instructions and tied several times to use this product. It does state you will feel a stinging sensation that will go away after a few uses. It didn't go away for me. My legs had tiny red dots all over them from the product yanking the root out. It did to well on that, if pain is beauty than it works well."
3,Doesn't pick up short or thinner hairs,"This is the cheapest epilator I've seen on the market, mostly because it is a travel size. I purchased this for my armpit hair, which are dark and a little long. On the instructions it says to cut your hair to less than 5mm, which is a little difficult for the armpit area in my opinion. The pores where my underarm hairs were pulled from were actually filled with blood afterward; not enough to ooze out, but you could definitely see it. Kind of scary, but it didn't hurt as much as I expected, since I tried this straight out of the shower. Will update when I use this longerAs I wrote in the title, it doesn't pick up shorter hairs or really fine hairs.For people who're using this for facial hair, I recommend using Sally Hansen's facial bleach, it works fairly well for upper lips but could irritate your skin a bit."
5,Amazing little thing!,"At first, I couldn't decide between this one and the larger Braun one, and then I figured, well I only need it for my underarms and bikini, so I'll just go with the smaller Emjoi. I am so glad I went with this one because I just absolutely love it. I actually threw away my razor after the first time I used it, and haven't looked back. It fits very nicely in your hand and since it's battery powered, you can travel with it. Works perfectly for underarms and bikini."
4,Pretty Good,"Great product. Really removes hair on underarms and bikini area. Once you get past the pain, you'll love it. Leaves skin smooth."
3,Painful but worth it,"I bought this product to use on my upperlip area. The epilating is very painful, but it is worth it for the price. I also use it on my legs and arms, when I travel."
4,Effective in removing cosmetic hair,"This product runs on batteries and it can last for a reasonable period of time. It fits within the palm of your hands and therefore easier to grab and handle. In addition, its portability makes it convenient for travel usage.It does remove the roots of the hair. This depends on the angulation of the blades to the surface of your skin, as well as, making sure the surface with the switch faces downwards. You may need to experiment with this angulation to ensure it is effective in what it does.And for the cost of this product, I do recommend this highly.It has been over a year and it is still functioning."
3,isn't worth the pain,I tried this on my face and it really hurt especially on the lip and after a day I already had stubble which means is pulled but just ripped at the skin instead of my hair being pulled out by the root. a lot of pain for one hairless day and that whole day I am red anyway. not really worth the pain.
4,Quality,"The first thing I noticed about this product after a little use was that rechargable batterys were a must. But overall I give it 4 stars. It is slim, light, and very manuverable in tight places such as underarms and the back of the knees. The overall design also allows for a light, pencil like grip which almost makes it fun to use. I would deffinatly recomend this product and have already to a couple of my friends."
4,perfect for small areas,"I hate shaving and sometimes wax. Waxing was so messy and irritating to my skin that I wanted to try something new.This product worked great for bikini-line and and underarms. Can be used 1-2 days after shaving (short hairs were less painful to remove for some reason). I got fewer ingrown hairs was happy with the ease of use and effectiveness. So far it has been easy to maintain--I touch up once a week. That way I never look hairy and since there is not much hair, it doesn't hurt at all.You would need a larger epilator to use on your legs, but this worked okay to pick up missed hairs from waxing, etc.It is much tinier than I expected--it would travel very well.I gave it 4 out of 5 because in some ways a larger epilator might be more practical and it uses batteries faster than I would like."
3,does its job,"I have to pass over the hairy area write a few times and it hurts like heck!! However, it works for what it is."
2,OW!,Received this item yesterday and I just tried it. I bought it specifically for my underarm hair. It's very thick and I was looking for an alternative to shaving as the black stubble is always still visible. I used it right after I showered thinking it would make the hair come out easier. That may be true but I'm telling you it hurts like crazy. The thing is loud and fast and reminded me of some sort of torture device. Although it hurt at first many reviews said that you get used to it. So I kept going. I didn't get used to it. You have to go over the same spots over and over and it takes a long time. I eventually had to give up. After the redness goes down and the bleeding stops I'll shave what I missed. I gave 2 stars because I do have some very nice clean patches...I may try it again with the hopes it get's easier but I doubt it.
4,"Nice, but Painful","Ok, Its not Painful like horrible, Its like tweezing your eyebrows, Its works and Is so much quicker then anything else but it is painful and I feel like I can only do so much at a time. But after a few months use it stop working?"
1,What a Waste,"I feel like I wasted my money on this one. It does not remove enough hair to be noticeable and is pretty darn painful, so you cannot use it in the same area for very long. I followed all instructions, but still feel disappointed."
1,Stick with waxing or plucking,"This is the most god-awful painful thing that I have ever put my body thru, and that's including natural childbirth, 2 surgeries, and the 5 inch heels I bought last week."
1,It doesn't work,"I tried replacing the batteries, following all the instructions in the manual to get it working, but it was of no use. Buying this product will clearly be a bad investment on your part. I had discarded the product item cover and tag as soon as I received it,so I had no way of replacing this product with a new one. I would suggest to look for a better safe guaranteed alternative and not choose this product."
2,Disappointed,I really hoped this would do a better job on facial hair. I use it almost daily and still can't keep up. I have light colored hair. I can't imagine it would work at all for someone with dark or coarse hair.
3,Epi Slim Epilator,The Epi Slim Epilator is a handy grooming aid. It works as advertized and is priced reasonably. I am happy with it.
1,Big NO-NO for me.,"Besides the loud sound and not so good work, I'm surprised how no one is complaining about the pain. IT HURTS LIKE HELL!!! And I'm the one, who can deal with the pain on the scale from 1 to 10 about at least 8. I tried on my bikini area and, on the top of the horrific pain, this thing pulls hair so hard that a blood is coming out of my skin along with the roots and tears from my eyes. Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but I never had such a problem while waxing. So, after about 30 seconds of torturing myself with this hair remover, I grabbed my razor and finished the job with shaving the entire area, which seemed like walking on the clouds. Yes, I'm back to shaving or waxing."
4,Happy.,"I was tired of using hair removal products that would leave my face red sensitive for days. This item is good for fine hair. Not too good with the course hairs. I still had to pull out my teasers to get those bad boys. The good thing is I was able to use my make up immediately after I used this little fella. I used it on my sister. She's very hairy and it did a great job of removing her facial hair too. I can use this a little more frequently whereas, with the facial creams that would remove my hair, I could only use them once a month. The price was good. It does need batteries but it has a lot of power. The pain level wasn't bad. It felt like a slight stinging sensation. I used it on my face, upper lip and under arms."
4,It converted me to epilating,"I use this mainly for underarms. At first I had to get used to the angles at which it works. If you are a first time user, please be aware that it hurts, but over due time the pain lessens and you'd just feel a plucking sensation. I've been using this for a year now and I'm never going back to shaving. Since your hair grows at different rates, it takes about 3-4 times before you can go a week without epilating. Because the hair has to regrow from its roots, the tip of the hairs become finer and less noticeable unlike the regrowth after shaving. It only takes 2-3 minutes per underarm and I never have to worry about wearing sleeveless blouses if I had gone without shaving for a week."
4,Works well,"Use this for my upper lip (was going to get waxed every other week). Although small, it works awesome and I have noticed less growth after only about a month. It hurts to pull out the hairs this way but that's just the process- not the product:)"
3,"1st one, good for coarse hair","I find this pretty good for coarser hair around the face, however, I was not signifiganrly impressed with the performance. I think for finer hair waxing is better. It really did not ""catch"" onto hair like I thought it would. However, I do like this better than tweezing."
3,hair remover,"This is and OK product, but it is painful to use and you have to go over the same spot several times."
2,fair skin and hair,I am not a fan. The pain wasn't awful but the process was annoying. It wouldn't pick up some of the coursest hairs on my chin. I kept having to go over the same area. It made my skin irritated and I even broke out afterwards. Choose a different method.
1,dissatisfied,"totally dissatisfied, Useless product. It leaves burning sensation on skin and sometimes bruises also. I dont know what they were thinking when making it as to where to use it."
3,ok,It is just okay - can't really explain what I was expecting but the product really is just ok - I wouldn't highly recommend it.
3,its ok,I wish this wasn't battery operated bc i go through a lot! Ive been using it for a month or so and it is easy breezy on the arms & legs. it is difficult and painful as hell under arms and private areas due to the way you have to hold the skin and the emjoi so it takes a lot of patients bc it is slow! I dont know if its worth it yet.
2,This thing hurts!,"If waxing is painful at least it's over quickly. This thing is long, sustained agony. I can't bear to use it long enough to see how well it really works, but it must be doing something."
5,My second one to buy,I have owned this for 3 years and I was buying a second one as a gift. great model.
3,Meh,"Seems alright, it's loud and I was hesitant to put this against my face, but I did. It pulls okay, might have to go around a few times. GET 2 AA Batteries!!!!!! I didn't realize this took batteries until it arrived, I was under the impression it charged or something... It does not! Great travel size. Great for coarse hair, the thin/light hair will seemed to be 'clipped' rather than twee-zed. Only complaint is the loudness of it, this is my first product like this, so I'm not sure if they are all like this. I'm use to twee-zing and waxing so this don't phase me any.. however if you are new to twee-zing or removing hairs.. this is going to hurt until you get use to it. I have not used it under my arms.. I'll stick to a razor there... and it is too big to maneuver around eye brows. I still like my twist and tweeze though :)"
5,love it!!!!,I love this product. I used it on my problem area and it worked perfectly.. I would by this for all the woman i know. it does hurt slightly but you get used to it... Very Very Happy
3,Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover,Works well enough. Used to remove some shoulder / back hair. Would buy again. Not likely a good option for fine hair removal.
1,Do not recommend.,"Not even a little like that.Does not work, I tried all ways to do it and nothing works.I thought it was the batteries that I removed from another device, but then I put new batteries, still did not work.I tried several times I just broke and threw it in the trash and my $ 20.51 including shipping I paid was spent for nothing.Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover"
1,Run! Don't walk AWAY from this item... unless you like pain,I have never had anything that came as close to torture as this device! It burnt my skin and hurt worse than anything I have ever seen!
2,WOMENS HAIR REMOVER,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO GET THIS PRODUCT. I AM 56 YEARS OLD FEMALE. I HAVE USE THE TWEEZIES INTHE PAST, AND I READ THE REVIEWS ON THIS AND THEY SEEMED TO BE GOOD. WELL AFTER USEING THIS PRODUCT AS DIRECTED I HAVE SORES WHEREVER I USED IT. IT IS IRRITATED. AND LARGES DRY SORES. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO PUT ON THEM. AND I CANT GET A DERMATOLOGIST APPT FOR A MONTH. THIS HAS TURN INTO A DISASTER. I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND"
2,Ouch!!!,"I tried to use it for bikini area, and ouch!!! SOB... Maybe it works better on other area. But I had to return it since it doen't work for what I wanted for."
2,Something Cujo dragged in,"I admit to being suspicious of this device. Why else would people start out saying things like, ""It didn't hurt that much""?YES, IT DID.Before I put this anywhere near my tender skin, I looked around for a guinea p--I mean, my husband. I tried it out on his palm first and then the back of his hand. He didn't flinch. The man is a rock.If I had known better, I would have tried it out on my brother, the Marine. He would have jumped up and down for me. In fact, I may try it out on him later, just for fun.Anyway, picture this. Use a tweezer to pluck out one hair at a time from your forearm. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again. Then do it again.Rinse and repeat."
1,Ouch!,"First of all, it misses a lot of tiny hairs. Second, it hurts! I stopped using it after a couple of painful attempts."
1,Ouch!,"This is my first epilator and it has made me totally certain I will never try this method again. First impression is it's LOUD and scary. Not something I want near me. Looks like a torture device! I decided to give it a shot anyways and not only did it not work very well (lots of breaking hairs rather than plucking them) but it feels like a torture device. I have waxed before and it doesn't hurt nearly as much as this thing. Not even close. Especially on my legs I'm not that sensitive to hair pulling pain, I have waxed and tweezed before and it wasn't an issue, but this thing made my eyes water. Never again. If you want to get rid of hair, try waxing. Much less painful than this!"
1,Tweeze is not Epi Slim,"When I ordered this ""Epi Slim"" for someone else the picture was different. The Tweeze is what she received. It only has one row of tweezers and does not work well at all. I have an Epi Slim and love it for facial hair, so if you want the Epi Slim shop elsewhere."
1,"RIPPED OFF, and I don't mean the hair!","I purchased this product a year ago 3/11 very hopefully and just used it on facial hair (don't know how it works anywhere else)... while I cannot tell you how many times I used it, it was really not very often. The last few times I was able to use it, it was difficult to start up, and finally even with fresh batteries it no longer works. I really feel ripped off and just threw it in the trash... and I paid much less than these prices I'm seeing now -- yet it still was a ripoff at any price."
1,Save your money!,"This product is horrible. It left a rash on my arm, and it left scarring. Good thing I only tested it on a small area before using this product. Save your money."
4,"Works good, but beware ingrown hairs.","This little machine did a great job removing the hair on my face. Surprisingly it didn't hurt as bad as I imagined it would. The only drawback about using this device is that I had several ingrown hairs a few days after using it. I would suggest using it after a hot shower on clean, exfoliated skin to help prevent this. Also, regular exfoliation after hair removal and using an antibacterial astringent would also be a good idea. I would not suggest using this on underarm or bikini hair because of the fact that there is no protective guard or guide on the rollers, but it works great for touchups and on the face."
3,Does what it is supposed to I guess,"I hate shaving all the time. The product works pretty well. Hurts like hell, can't say I ever waxed. I have used it in the ""bikini area"" it pulls doesn't always pull hair out. I think that causes more pain than necessary. Grit your teeth and maybe in 10 minutes you will have a nice clean area. Maybe a few bumps but they will resolve. Maybe a higher powered one would hurt less, but for 10 bucks it sure beats a tweezer. It is bearable. On the bright side tweezing the few hairs it may miss doesn't feel like much at all."
1,JUNK!,"This item is a piece of junk! Ordered the first which arrived and would not even turn on! Returned for replacement which was prompt, and the 2nd was exactly the SAME as the first one! It wouldn't even turn on! Worthless. Not bothering a third time!"
2,not for me...caused too much irritation,"Well, I was very excited to receive this, but it didn't work as hoped for me. I purchased it for use in the bikini and under arm area. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to achieve results in the under arm area. I felt like I couldn't get the skin taught enough. I lacked the correct angle and needed more hands I think. As for the bikini area, it worked ok, but left me too irritated. I followed the instructions and exfoliated, but I was still left w/ some ingrown hairs. I had this problem before w/ waxing, so I think I am just not a good candidate for this kind of hair removal."
2,OUCH...and a total breakout!,"Okay, I absolutely HATE this thing. I have PCOS and was hoping it would help with my unfortunate chin stubble. Not only does it HURT like a SOB and feels like I'm being sliced open by razor blades while I'm Epi-ing, but it left me with a HORRIBLE breakout. I took pics and will try to load. I have very dry skin so have never really had problems with acne - until I used this product. Partially my own fault though so please read and take heed - if you purchase and use this, be sure to put a COLD damp cloth on your face afterwards to close up all the pores that you just ripped hair follicles out of BEFORE you put on any lotion or makeup. I mistakenly used both after using this and all the gunk filled my pores and broke me out something wicked. I probably have 30+ pimples on my chin alone...all tiny ones and right next to each other so it looks like a huge strawberry on my chin. I do not like this product at all. I'll just keep shaving every other day... :-("
1,Definitely NOT for the face!,"I bought it for the face. I have light skin, not sensitiv with light hair and a few dark coarse hairs at the chin. The emjoi AP-9L gave me the worst rash of my life. I did not left the house for a week, because I could not even cover my rash with make up.The machine is worling well and might be a good travel size epilator. But if you are thinking about getting this one just for the face, don't buy !"
2,OUCH,"When you turn this thing on it will jump you out of your shoes. There is no way anyone can use it. I bought it for my face and nope, I'm not doing that .. so I let the hair on my leg grow so that I could get a better feel for it. And NO .. no way am I gonna put this thing on any part of my body. I will save and get a more realistic item to remove the facial hair that taunt me and until then i will pluck which is heaven compared to the damage I think this item can cause"
3,So far so good!,"Just got my emjoi epi slim in tonight! I have tried it out and while it works! (YAY!) I have to agree with what some have said in these reviews that it does take a couple of times of going over the area before you get all the hair... Using on the armpits is particularly difficult trying to pull the skin taught on top of trying to see exactly what you're doing.... While I don't find it all that painful I know some people might.. especially (like some on here have said) if you have never waxed before it will definitely not be a pleasurable experience the first few times... I used to wax so I'm used to how it feels to have the hair ripped out by the root... For the first use, so far so good... hopefully the next use will be quicker and even better!"
4,"A little painful, but works","It does hurt a bit,but you kind of get used to it after a while. It's good for the upper lip and chin. After I took a shower I tried under my arm, but it didn't seem to get much hair and it was pretty painful.For the price it's a good product.Also, I am a woman."
1,waist of money,im pretty pissed at myself for buying it.it doesnt work on coures hair.and after 3trys it doest work at all.please save your money and dont purchase
4,Very portable but not very thorough,"I've had this for about 7 months now and have been using it once or twice every week.Pros:- Very portable, you can carry it around in your purse- The batteries actually last a very long time - the first time I changed batteries was after 3 months of weekly use for about 5-10 minutes each timeCons:- You have to run over the same areas multiple times sometimes to get it to remove a hair- I once used it on my face right after I had a shower and it totally bruised my upper lip and chin area. It took a couple of weeks for the scars to heal. That was probably my fault for using it right after a shower. I've never had any issues with it otherwise.It's not as powerful (of course, it's not as expensive!) as a Braun silk-epil that I sometimes use as well - that one grabs all the hair, ALL the time. I'd say this is a good substitute for when you're traveling or for quick touch-ups. But just don't expect it to be perfect, it isn't."
4,PERFECT SHAVE,"IF YOU NEED A QUICK TOUCH UP ON YOUR CHIN, LIP, OR UNDERARM THIS IS THE ITEM TO HAVE. REMOVES HAIR WITH JUST A LITTLE PINCH, COMPARED TO WAXING. A DEFINITE MUST HAVE FOR ALL WOMEN."
1,Confused!!!!,"I bought this about 2 months ago after seeing all good review against it and am a bit disappointed.I used it on my Upper lip and CHIN area and it hurt a lot. I expected that because I have ""braun silk epil"" but what I didn't expect was the wound .. it scratched my skin layer and gave painful bumps that created a mark its over four week still the mark is there. It was so gross and embarrassed. I'm not too sure what I did wrong.But what I did notice was that I had to go over the same area multiple times to get the majority of the hair out and never really did get it all. I think that causes the BUMP and CUT .I can't recommend this product because it seemed like it requires more power to get all of the hair cleanly and efficiently.. I MAY HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN ,BUT the PRODUCT says that IT IS FOR SENSITIVE SKIN ...I AM DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT and UNHAPPY ...."
2,Disappointed,"Causes bumps all my side burns and chin. Didn't clear up for at least two weeks. I'm afraid to use it again. Not sure if its my sensitive skin or what, but i had a bad reaction to using this."
3,small,this works ok not as goods as I hoped it would I'm on cam all day for work it leave red spots and I have to use every day but works on my legs than the cream
1,painful and didn't work,"so the package says it works for bikini lines.... it didn't. it would not actually grab and pull out hair ANYWHERE i tried it, on my legs it just broke off the hairs, and everywhere else it wouldn't grab much, and what it did grab, it painfully pulled, then let go. I'm used to waxing, but having little individual hairs randomly pulled with no result.... not going to happen. horrible horrible product."
2,Its not the same product shown in the pic,"Its not the same product shown in the pic , and its not working in good waymaybe the one in the pic is much better"
3,Somewhat Satisfied,This product does remove hair but didn't work as well on coarse hair...so a bit of a disapointment. I read other reviews before purchasing and decided to buy since some were saying that it works great on coarse hair...but it doesn't. For now I will have to stick to threading with my $1.99 spring hair removal which hurts but works great until I can afford one of those expensive tools.
2,very uncomfortable,"It is likely to keep using it, maybe you can get used, but the truth is that this is quite uncomfortable, painful, the engine is too high a working party of revolution, and touches the skin, causing an unpleasant impression, and it only tested in the forearm."
1,Total waste of money,Useless product. Does not remove any hair. It was advertised as being good for small areas but is a total failure.
3,Not what I thought it was.,"I thought this was the 'NoNo' product for hair removal. It doesn't work too bad, but could be better. I wouldn't really recommend this product. Sorry."
1,Awful product. doent even shave my 10 year daughter.,Awful product. doent even shave my 10 year daughter. dont buy it. it is a waste of money! i cant use it.
3,Hurts like Hell,"I do not know if this item is suppose to be painful, but if that's it's fuction, then the Epi Slim does that beautifully."
3,Emjoi AP-9L Epi Slim Cosmetic Hair Remover,"Este producto es bueno para el pelo corto y fino, es doloroso al principio (sobre todo en areas muy sencibles) con el uso va desapareciendo la sensacion. Es facil de usar y tiene un tamaño muy practico."
1,You have to get use to this thing,This really hurts much worst than tweezing (beauty is pain but ouch I'll have to try something else).
1,non working,I got this for a gift for my daughter and it doesn't work. I'm pretty sure she threw the original pkg away and now I'm at a loss of what to do. Brand new never been used....
4,Good edging,Bought this edging last year. Very easy to install if you water the area down first. Easier to keep a straight line than the black tubular edging and the black eco edge quick edge I have. I plan on eventually replacing all of my edging with this.
4,Worked Great! Easy to Install!,"This edging was a breeze to install. Pieces interlock making it even stronger and should stay in place. It does have a plastic look (up close) and feel but from a distance it looks great and keeps the mulch in the beds. You CAN create curves but have to be somewhat larger curves because the product is 12"", just like any other non bending 12"" edger. I put the borderstone type in my backyard but will be purchasing the red 'brick' look for my front yard replacing the outdated concrete stone edging. It might not be the ticket for a high dollar home, one might want to splurge on 'real' high dollar rock/edging.Also, I got free shipping from Amazon for the reviewer who said it wasn't worth the added cost of shipping."
3,meh,"These plastic borders were a bit flimsy and they didnt look as good as I expected from the photo. They look OK, but I ended up buying cement border from Home Depot to replace them."
2,Product may not match images shown.,"I went ahead and ordered this despite other reviewers because I had seen the item in a store and the pictures looked the same. I figured if the color representation was off, it wouldn't be a big deal, as long as they matched (I had ordered 2).Wrong.The item I received is different from the picture shown in every way. First off, I selected the Fieldstone color option.l To begin with discrepancies, it is not the short 3"" tall border as shown, and that I had seen in a store. I received a 6"" or so tall border that has the look of stacked fieldstone. Secondly, it is not two sided, it is tall, skinny, and has the empty side. Lastly, it isn't 10ft long. The product I received is only 9' 4"". That being said, I am returning it, and I cancelled the one that hadn't shipped yet.Order with caution. I will post a photo of what the Fieldstone actually is. Perhaps that will help other shoppers."
1,Dinkier than expected and very shiny.,"This ""rock"" edging is around 3/4"" inch thick back to front, and 2 inches tall. It is smaller than I expected and also glaringly shiny. It looks exceptionally fake. I'll be using something else."
4,Edging for lawn / garden,The items shipped quickly and installed easily. The only tools needed were a rubber mallet and a garden spade. The spade was only needed in the event that a thick root had to be cut to allow the edger to be driven into the soil.
2,Does not stay in the ground,I purchased this product last Spring and installed 6 boxes of this edging. It does not stay in the ground and I'm constantly walking around pushing it down. I push one piece down and another piece pops up. It is a good concept but the functionality needs work.
1,Never Again,"A waste of time. I will never buy these again. Puny, uneven, and wasn't anything that I expected. Don't waste your money."
2,Wrong Product Number,"I ordered this item twice and twice I received the wrong product. Instead of receiving the item pictured and applicable part number, I received ""SUNCAST FDS10GY FIELDSTONE EDGING""......completely different item than what is pictured and described.Part number and descripton needs to be corrected somewhere along the line (I tried to explain this to the customer service agent.....not sure if anything was done).Rather than getting the wrong item a third time, I purchased this item from another supplier."
1,ITEM NUMBER IS NOT FOR THIS IMAGE,The Item number is for 10-1 foot sections of part number BSE10TG. The picture is for part number FDS10GY. The image is for a different part number than listed.
3,Edging,"Winter weather has prevented installing the edging, but it appears to be what I needed for my project."
5,Which Way Batman is great father/son activity,My son and I have enjoyed this book together many times. The story lines are interesting and short enough to keep my sons interest. We read this book over and over and each time it is different. I reccommend this book to any parent with a child that has any interest in Batman.
5,The Sizzler - St. Louis Hero,"This is a ""must read"". Babe Ruth grabbed the headlines. Yet, this St. Louis Browns star was respected by his peers as one of the best in the game."
3,Missed the point,This book didn't work for me. It didn't really have any workable suggestions. Just so-so.
2,Good intro from XS to SQL but outdated!,The book deals mostly with SQL Server 6.5 and 7.0 and two chapters are dedicated solely for running these two systems. If you're interested in SQL Server 2000 and MS Access 2000 I recommend SAMS MS Access Developer's Guide to SQL Server or a similar book.
4,"Enjoyed it, despite myself","I usually hate movies about actors and how interesting they are. They aren't at all. However, this little indie film is well written, and the subject just happens to be journeymen actors and their quest for success as they toil away as waiters and bartenders. The characters are all stereotypes, but the one who does the pretentious one man show is pretty funny, especially when he tells off two casting people, one of whom is Chris Lawford, the Kennedy cousin. Very watchable."
5,The book that started me on a lifetime of reading,"When I was about twelve years of age, I read this book as the first real book I had ever read. I loved it. The story concerns some kids who seek an underwater treasure, the result of a shipwreck centuries ago. There are also some bad guys after the treasure. I just ordered this book (which I haven't seen in thirty years) to read to my children. After I finished this book, I read as many Robb White books as I could find and then branched out into other types of books. This is the book that started me on a lifetime of reading. I gave it five stars because of its effect on my life. I fear it may not be as good as I remember and, beware, it is not politically correct; i.e., it is violent and portrays violence in pursuit of a good purpose as good. Although I originally found this book in school and read it with the encouragment of my teachers, this book would not be allowed in public schools today."
5,Great book!,"My dad's favorite book as a kid, gave it to me when I was young and accidentally lost it as I aged. Thanks to the magic of amazon I was able to track it down and give him a great birthday present!"
3,A Bit Risky For Bronson-Lola,"Watched the movie Lola which is in this set, a bit of a departure for Bronson this film would have been quite risky at the time for the content.He plays a middle-aged writer of porn novels who falls in love with a sixteen year old school girl while in retreat in Britain.They then get married and move to the States , but it all turns to custard after that as we all know can be the problem to people with huge age gaps between them.A semi kind of comedy/drama , easy to watch stars a young Susan George and directed by the legendary Richard Donner."
5,Great DVD,"Received DVD in great shape and was well packaged, this is one of my favorite actors, and I have a lot of his movies."
3,Be wary.,"So far I have watched Lola, Cold Sweat, and some Man with a camera episodes, and Man with a Camera is the only one that doesn't make me feel like I put on my grandpa's glasses. The film quality is terrible on the full feature movies. Seven dollars is a good deal, but not really worth it for how blurry everything is."
3,No widescreen films here!,"Cold Sweat was not widescreen!Other than that it was worth a few bucks.It sucks to be mislead, though I'd buy it again."
1,Not recommended,"I don't know if it was defective, but it burnt the first time I plugged it.Fortunately Amazon refunded me in full. Thank you Amazon!"
1,Unhealthy kettle,"I bought this kettle maybe 5 years ago. Within three years, it began to degrade inside. I have never used anything acidic in this kettle and we are on soft well water that is very good to drink. I cannot even give this kettle away to Good Will because I don't want anyone else to be unhealthy either. I have bought a new kettle and won't be buying a Le Creuset kettle again, ever."
2,The jury is still out...,"The first kettle was damaged and had to be returned. We are reserving judgement right now. There is a small screw that holds the handle on that was loose when we got it. We've had to tighten it several times. The phillips head will strip if you're not very careful. It is a heavy kettle. To me, the screw is too tiny for the weight of the handle, especially when the kettle is full. For the price and considering how well made the rest of it is, why such a wimpy screw? I'm keeping the box in case it needs to go back...."
5,I'm a little teapot...,"I really like this teakettle. It is so quiet (most make burbling noises while coming up to temp.) until the whistle blows. I can hear it from rooms away, of course I never have music or a tv blaring. Very cute and well designed. Very ergonimic.All I have to do is turn my wrist to pour. I didn't experience the glugging/splashing that I read about in the other reviews. But then I tend to allow the water to flow, instead of trying to pour it quickly. The lid fits snuggly so I never have to give a thought to whether it will fall off. I'm very pleased with this purchase. Thanks A.D.C."
4,Fantastic and unique design,Great design.. works as it should and solid whistle to let you know the water is boiled! Have yet to see one like it in a store.
1,Refried Crepes,"You won't be able to ""double your pleasure or double your fun "" with La Cage 2. This flick is La Cage (deja Vou )Same players, different plot. If plagued with Insomnia, this one is guaranteed to put you to sleep. Something important is missing ? Funny?=no, entertaining?=no, boring?,=yes"
3,Modern is better,"Not only because the new American version is modern and actual, but mainly the excellent cast and better timing. Is surprisingly alike but different in what I mentioned before. I still remember my joy seeing the original on tv before the new version, but I definitely prefer Robin William's one."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"before the movie ""bird cage"" this movie predates it by about 20 years.Sadly the American public would not have allowed such a movie back in the 1970's, ITs a pleasure to see how very simlar these two movies are to one another. THIS movie really makes one laugh."
3,Mixed Bag,"GK presents a series of brief sketches of various British types, providing insightful social commentary in the process. The cumulative effect is a fairly good portrait of English life in the early 1900's, but with a good deal less of the wit and tight reasoning that you see in most of his other works. On the other hand, there are a few sections that are as eloquent and insightful as anything I've read of GK. A real problem is that this particular edition contains no footnotes whatsoever. This makes it quite difficult to understand the full sense of GK's ideas, since the book is chock-full of obscure (today) references. Also this addition has typos all over the place."
5,I am very pleased.,"From the ordering to the receiving of the product, overall I was pleased with the process. There was some mix up with the Post Office but that was in no way the fault of the supplier. Once I received the book I was extremely pleased with the quality of my product."
3,Nice book but...,"This is a good, pretty thorough text for control systems, but its difficult to find what you're looking for if you're just briefly glancing through the chapters. Sections are not clearly distinguishable - lacking bold or different color text. It could also use more clearly marked examples."
1,"Good, if you already familiar with...","Good if you've already familiar with Control Systems.It skips some parts as detailing in Mathematical Foundation and goes straight to the subject that you want to know.Comes with a CD with a very handy Mathlab program to solve Transfer Functions,etc.However, you have to download the Appendixes from the internet, because contrary to what it says, there are no appendixes on the included CD, only the Mathlab program.But it is a good book for post-graduate students and engineers."
1,...,Save yourself the waste of money you will inccur if you purchase this book. If you're looking for a decent book I suggest the Sybex or Microsoft line of books.There's a reason why so many used copies are for sale....
1,Useless,"I didn't like the book, was a total waste of money for me. Fortunately I didn't pay much for it.Bow Wow! 50 Simple Ways to Pamper Your DOG! (Barnes & Noble)."
4,Money well spent,Land of the Pharaohs was a movie that had always remained in my memory as one that had all the contents of a good movie.
3,Land of the Pharoahs,"Don't know what possessed me to buy it! Jack Hawkins is a brilliant actor, so perhaps this was the reason, though he was alot better in ""Ben Hur"". The very young Joan Collins should have fired her makeup artist or sued her for ruining a beautiful face to portray a cypriot? Still, it ""masked"" her hammy acting. Sorry Joan, but the ending was very fitting!"
4,Pharaohnic Silliness...but wonderfully done,"Land of the Pharaohs is a much-maligned epic from the Fifties produced and directed by Howard Hawks. The script is silly, the acting over the top, Dimitri Tiomkin's score unrelenting, yet...yet it does have a certain majesty and creates an atmosphere of early Egypt that is striking in its primitive starkness. Beautifully photographed and staged, this is a near miss but highly recommended to those who loved the great old spectacles from the Fifties.One complaint: It has been packaged a a ""camp classic"" with a lurid Joan Collins on the case cover. I think it deserves more respect than that and perhaps someone will do a complete restoration sometime complete with footage from the authentic Egyption locations."
2,Silliness from the 1950s,"This is called a ""cult classic"" by the sellers because there is probably no other way to persuade people to buy this turkey. Oh yes, and the sexy picture of Joan Collins on the cover. (She appears far less sexy in the film.) With a cast of thousands, Howard Hawks tried to recreate ancient Egypt, turning history into weak soap opera in the process. The crowd scenes are especially amusing; watch all 'dem Egyptians clap their hands in rhythm and make Nazi-like signs of allegiance to Jack Hawkins and his 1955 haircut. An absurd and boring film. And if you like this one, try The Egyptian. Edmund Purdom makes Dewey Martin seem like Laurence Olivier."
5,LAND OF THE PHARAOHS DVD,"I do not remember seeing this movie when it came out or at any time. I did thoroughy enjoy it, though, and would recommend it highly."
4,Hokey - Cheesy - Classic 50's B Movie - Must See,"I love this stupid movie. It sticks in your mind like chewing gum even after the little bit of flavor is gone. The supporting actors in this are so sincere and the moral message so great that it overcomes most of the real shortcomings like poor writing, stiff acting by some and cheesy set budgets when compared to CLEOPATRA w/ Liz taylor. Joan Collins as an Egyptian Slave Girl cum Queen is pricelessly kitchy. And at $[...] well worth the hoot.Land of the Pharaohs"
1,Land of the Pharaohs,"I was anticipating getting this movie as I haven't seen it in many years. Alas, the disk hung up (stopped playing) during the first two minutes of the movie. I tried skipping forward to see if that would get it to play, no such luck. I cleaned the disk and noticed several small scratches where the video begins. Oh well, I just learned a valuable lesson, don't buy used stuff. I never will again."
4,THE BAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL,"I remembered seeing this when I was a child. If you've never seen it, the climax is startling (don't advance to the end!). The pharoah is played stiffly by Hawkins. Sidney Chaplin (Charlie's son) is excellent as captain of the guard who is manipulated by the pharoah's newest bride. The scenes of pyramid building are very good. Great commentary feature, probably more entertaining than the movie itself. Some of the scenes are funny from today's perspective. Something you might want to view w/friends. Entertaining."
5,Land of the Pharaohs,"I have loved this movie snide I watched it as a kid. It has a great story. A few years ago I looked on TCM and the Internet both, and it didn't show anywhere, but now, here it is! That's great. Oh, and by the way, I love the music in it.Julie"
4,At Last!,"Well, I thought it would never come out on DVD. Perhaps it's my passion for all things ancient Egyptian, but I have always loved this wonderfully enjoyable epic. Howard Hawks was a director who steadfastly refused to be pigeon-holed, making everything from Bogey's ""The Big Sleep"" to sci-fi classic ""The Thing"" (although he credited editor Christian Nyby instead of himself) to stock car racing ""Red Line 7000."" Here he takes a shot at ""historical"" epic and does a damned entertaining job of it. Pharaoh Jack Hawkins plays straightman to Joan Collins' campy concubine while James Robertson Justice does a terrific job of keeping a straight face as a tomb architect. Amidst all the stone monuments, the only thing wooden is Dewey Martin as Justice's son. All this may not sound like a **** movie, but it's a guilty pleasure I've watched so many times on VHS that it's embarrassing. That's gotta be worth extra credit."
2,About the Korean Version,"This DVD version is letterbox, but that's about all one can appreciate in this edition. Picture quality doesn't even match the VHS version. Large crowd scenes have characteristic jiggle common to VHS. Focus is not sharp and crisp.I compared my VHS with the DVD and the VHS actually had better picture quality, albeit pan & scan full-screen. I would wait for the studio edition of this DVD (if it ever happens.)"
5,"Movie is a ""Gem""",Excellent movie.Hats off to the Director of Photography.Joan Collins performance is 5 Stars.Good clear proper English dialog.
4,"William Faulkner in the credits! Joan Collins, 20 yrs. old. Hubba-Hubba!","What a treat for lusty snobs. A script by William Faulkner and a lubricious 20 year old Joan Collins as leading lady.This may not be history, but it would be if history had any say in it. I love the way that the denouement revolves around Jewish craftiness represented by James Robertson Justice. (He doesn't LOOK Jewish.)Enjoy! The scuttlebutt is that Joan and the actor who played her regicide, (or, more exactly, Pharoahcide), co-conspirator were having such vigorous amorous dalliances off-camera, and replenishing their energies with such gargantuan feasts, that they both become visibly fat and had to be put on diets."
4,Spectacular with a great ending,"I've always liked this spectacular Cinemascope costume picture which must have cost a Pharoah's fortune. The ending is unforgettable. It's all about the building of the Pyramids which is quite interesting. It is campy--my favorite line is when Joan Collins is plotting to murder her husband and she says, ""you know that old saying"". How much older can you get! Apparently the 3-disc set (with two other wide-screen spectaculars) is still available and costs considerably less than just this film itself. Gets it before its extinct."
3,The Egyptians Were Certainly Master-Builders,"When I initially viewed this film as a young boy many years ago on ""regular"" TV, naturally, the most fascinating aspect of the film (for me) was a sexy and erotic Joan Collins. But, years later, in retrospect, I view ""Land of the Pharoahs"" as a camp masterpiece. Sure, there are many sensational panoramic scenes and the film stars legendary British actor Jack Hawkins. Nevertheless, the story and dialog are definitely predictable and fall flat for most of the film.But, if you are a Joan ""Dynasty"" Collins fan, this film will provide an interesting glimpse of her early acting and natural beauty."
4,A Classic Must Have for Egypt Lovers,"The format is not full screen. It is letterboxed widescreen. None the less, I find that it portrays the people of the time in a more accurate light than the atypical ""slave"" role of so many other movies. It's easy to see in this movie where Joan Collins developed her ""catty"" side. Too bad it was not better produced as full screen or anamorphic widescreen."
5,Like a glove!,"We found and ordered these after we broke one of the hinges on our butler coffee table. They are excellent quality, came individually wrapped with screws, and fit like a glove. Have had them now for over a year and still look like they just came out of the box. Excellent product!"
5,Excellent Choice,This CD arrived within 4 days and was exactly as billed by seller. Great selection of music.
1,Wrong tracking info,"The worst shipment ever. Ships late, and they refused to cancel my order twice. And the tracking information they put was wrong."
5,Ceramic Travel Mug,This is a great mug. Since it's ceramic your coffee tastes just like it does out of your kitchen coffee mug.
5,Great Help,Had a project for school in LISP there isn't much help on the internet so this book was a great help when it came to figuring out the language. Highly recommended for learning the basics.
2,Outdated and confusing,This book is outdated and harder to understand than most programming books. I would recommend Practical Common LISP by Peter Siebel in place of this book.Practical Common LispThe example code in the book doesn't compile in modern Common LISP implementations and there are no comments whatsoever in the book. The author doesn't even acknowledge that comments exist in LISP.
2,This book is suitable for people who already know Lisp.,"Graham knows his Lisp, no question about it. But, like 90+ % of programming textbook writers he doesn't know the basics of paedogogy. Words are used long before their definitions. The concept of answers to questions isn't in the book. The proper way to write such a book is to deliver the material in the tiniest possible chunks and give review questions to make sure the reader really has mastered the point. There MUST be frequent quizzes with answers. An example of a book that does do this is Teach Yourself C by Schildt or Schildt's Teach Yourself C++ 3rd Edition. If you really need an INTRODUCTION to Lisp then in my opinion you should not buy this book. If you already know some Lisp Graham's book will be useful."
2,good tasty item--too expensive,"Barry Farms-established in Oct 1994 by Billand Linda Barry. Located in Cridersville,Ohio. They are to busy now to grow all theproducts they sell.They are an internet grocery store.I bought the red/green peppers 2oz for$8.46..free shipping ??????????????????On the BF web site the same exact item sellsfor $1.59.

5,Mimi of 5,This is a great toy for preschoolers to help with fine motor skills. I was a preschool teacher for 16 years and my students always enjoyed these. I have now bought them for my granddaughter. I know she will enjoy them because she loves necklaces - and with these she can make her own.
4,I enjoyed it,"I read the Blanchard's cookbook in two sittings at Barnes & Noble. The photography is beautiful and the recipes are reasonably simple. I tried the Brown Sugar and Basil Bacon right away and it was a nice sweet change from what is always eaten. And there are others in the book that I am excited to try out.One other nice thing about the Blanchard's book is that it's quite unusual. It has stories of their lives mixed right in with the recipes. If you enjoy reading or looking at cook books ""Cook What You Love"" makes for a delicious read."
1,hate to seem like the naysayer but...,"I did not find the recipes in this book very original or very useful. Most can be found elsewhere including (surprise!) garlic bread, for example, pasta with butter, egg salad sandwich, ham sandwich, and chocolate chip cookies; many other recipes fit in this category. Anyway, except for ""over-rated,"" based on reviews here, it is more difficult to say what it is than what it is not, so I will briefly attempt the latter: it is not a carribean cookbook; it is not a gourmet cookbook; it is not a ""comfort food"" cookbook; it is not an ""ecclectic"" cookbook; it is not a travel cookbook; it is not a local ""history"" cookbook. For me, it all boils down to the recipes, and I cannot give a high review on that basis, nor (as noted above) on any other basis."
3,"great show, but technical problems with the disc","South American version of the disc, most of it was very good quality. unfortunately on the last two tracks the audio is out of sync. same problem shows up on four different players.the performance content is great though, a really good concert & extras."
4,If you have enough motivation . . .,"I am getting married soon, so I bought this to remove my leg hair. My leg hair is the nastiest, black, thick hair imaginable, and it looks wretched on my skin which is so pale it is nearly transparent. Following the advice of other reviews, I used the emjoi twice the first week and then weekly for a couple of weeks after that. Now I probably use it once every two or three weeks. The first few weeks it was incredibly painful. But now it is not nearly as bad, and I am thrilled with the results! I still shave between uses, but my legs are soft and they don't feel like sandpaper 12 hours after shaving. I am very happy with it.Also, the pain wasn't nearly as bad when I used it the much finer hair on my lips.So, all in all, if you have the determination and tolerance for pain of an amazon, you might like this product."
1,Terrible!,"This removal system does not work! It hurts more than conventional methods, and contrary to the summary, it does not remove hair by the root, so you cannot go six weeks without using it."
3,It's okay,"The first time I used this, the pain was almost unbearable for the first few minutes, but then it actually became tolerable half way through, probably because I didn't have much hair left. Anyway, the first time I used it, it literally sucked out every single hair in it's path. The second time I used it, I had to go over a single hair like 10 times before it came out. Also, I've noticed that it works better on thicker hair. I don't think that the thickness or thinness of my hair was the cause of it not working as well the second time, I think it actually lost it's power! Seriously. Not to mention, I had TONS of ingrown hairs. On the positive side, my legs were sooooo squeeky smooth for a good two weeks. Now I'm just dealing with all the ingrown hairs. Oh, by the way, when you hold this, it works better at a certain angle, so if it doesn't seem to be working at first, turn it until it works."
1,My five year old has better writting skills...,"This book was the worst written piece of tripe I have ever had the displeasure of reading. I love vampire books, but this had plot holes big enough to drive a Mac truck through. The character depth was as shallow as a puddle. I would recommend this book to anyone who had a fascination with torturing themselves."
5,Amazing..,"I love this novel...usually, I am into reading vampire romance novels, but this book was a pleasent surprise, I mainly read it to have something to do. I am very happy to have read it, I certainly recommend it."
5,Best Product,I only buy Verbatim CD/DVDs. They always play in all players. I would buy them again and also recommend to a friend.
5,Great quality and awesome prints!,I've been buying Verbatim hub-printable inkjet CDs for over three years and I've never had a single coaster or a bad print on any of them. They're perfect for my Epson Artisan 800 and I burn with both my computer's CD burner and my Microboards QDL-1000 duplicator. The ink dries fast and the finished product always plays!
5,cd-r,these cd-rs inkjet sthese inkjet cd-rs are very good to print pictures on i use a brouther printer to do thiswork
5,Great alternative to paper labels,"The Verbatim 97019 are a great inexpensive alternative to the old paper label process for CD's especially if you are producing a quantity for distribution. I produce music CD's of original music for my gigs, festivals, etc. These CD's are reliable, work perfectly with my inkjet printer and I am very happy with this product."
1,Total Crap,"I bought two rungs of these and they were total total crap. Maybe one out of ten of them worked, and when I was able to get it to burn it would barely play the songs in cd players. I tried to burn them on 3 different burners and played them back on 4 different CD players. Not worth it."
3,Inkjet printable CDRs.,The blanks work fine. They were a little pricey. I will find another place to buy them.
1,"Great Book, But the type front is too small to easily read","This a very good book, descriptive, well laid out. However, the type is very small, needing a magnifying glass for prolonged reading. The captions under the excellent pictures and diagrams are even smaller. I suspect the small type was done to save on printing costs, as upping the fonts would have required more paper. I would have gladly paid more money for better readibility."
3,cute but not that great,"We bought this toy for our 6 month old who loves to ""kick"" just about anything around her. The toy is easy for the child to kick, has cute sounds that are activated when kicked, BUT, the child wants to see what he or she is kicking. They have to strain their necks to see what they are kicking. After a couple of uses, our daughter became frustrated because she had to lift her head to see the toy light up. Everytime we tied the toy higher on the bars in the crib, it kept on slipping down after it was kicked. It's a cute concept, but has its flaws."
2,nothing special,"My daughter is a year old now, and has had this toy in her crib basically from the beginning. She's never really shown much interest in it at all, which is weird, because she loves most other toys that have music and lights and buttons to push. But this she barely plays with, even when I try to get her interested in it.I think part of the problem might be that the keys are tough for a baby to distinguish (the whole thing just looks like one big piece of cloth), so it's hard for her to tell where she's supposed to push, or even that her pushing causes the sound and lights. Actually, now that she's old enough to understand the concept of a ""button,"" she keeps trying to push on the lights themselves, because they look more like buttons than the keys do.Also, the music's a little annoying. If you get this as a gift, it might be worth keeping, but I wouldn't run out and buy one."
1,Cheap,"This item is not worth the price you pay for it.My husband and I purchased this for our daughter for Christmas. The item was working when we wrapped it. It was under the tree for about 1 week. When she opened it Christmas Day, it did not work. We changed the batteries and it still would not work. My husband took it apart to try to fix it with no luck. I would not recommend purchasing this item."
3,Doesn't hold interest,"My son is 9 months old and is still not interested in this toy (he's has it since 3 months old). He'll play with it for a few minutes, but quickly looses interest. Maybe he will like it better when he's a little older..."
4,great for babies,"My daughter really seems to enjoy this toy! She loves looking at the lights and kicking the piano. She is now starting to sit up, so we moved it off of her crib and on to the floor. Now she enjys playing it like a piano and it helps her with sitting up. A great buy!!"
1,What is the fuss about,"This kick and play toy is not the exciting as it was said here the can't live without toy we were told it would be. The warning says that the toy must be removed from the crib when the child can sit up unassisted. Humm thats the age when they will have the most fun with it.... I think this was just one of those toys that eveyone jumped on the bandwagon on. My little girl seemed to wonder what what going on with this and why was she having to kick her legs, even when she did try she had to really kick supper hard to get the darn thing to even work. We had it all of one month and gave it to the Goodwill."
5,Beware,This book is not for beginners or even intermediate practitioners. It contains practices which require personal instruction from a qualified teacher.
2,Somewhat disappointing,"Compared to other lonely planet guides, this one is somewhat lacking in information. There are almost no pictures, and very little about what's interesting to see in the various locations.It gives pretty good information about hotels, but not about what is interesting to see there.For Corsica, the rough guide is better."
5,Compelling reading from beginning to end,"Courageously written by David Race Bannon, Race Against Evil is the dark, gripping memoir of one man's ruthless service to Interpol from 1979 to 1999. His dedicated mission was to search out child pornographers and human slave traders, -- and then to end their lives. Exciting reading, disturbing revelations, and with an emphasis on Bannon's personal misgivings as to whether or not killing criminals makes the sanctioned assassin no better than his targets, Race Against Evil is compelling reading from beginning to end. This is the stuff of which legends and blockbuster movies are made!"
1,does the author of this cartoon-like fantasy ever explain...,"...how it is is that he shares the name of a cartoon fantasy character from the 1960s tv show Johnny Quest? A lot of this bookcomes across as just plain preposterous. I think this man's imagination is on a par of that other remarkably self-absorbed orientophile fantasist, Steven Seagal, albeit with a calculated dose of humility and phony soul-searching thrown in to ""keep it real"". The reality of the horror of child slavery deserves a more serious forum than it gets from the macho theatrics of this book. For something closer to the truth, read the 1/25/04 New York Times Magazine article by Peter Landesman..."
5,FANTASTIC!,This book was fantastic. What a journey through the warren of tunnels and lies at Interpol. Def worth the read. The book inspired me to look up the net to follow up the story myself. There you can read the news reports that are summarized in the book and interviews with the men Bannon describes. Def worth the money.
1,Author Arrested for Criminal Impersonation,"The author of this book made the whole thing up. He was arrested in 2006 for fabricating a background of experience in human trafficking and then attempting to charge consulting and speaking fees based on that experience. He pled guilty.All Interpol does is facilitate communication between police forces in different countries, it doesn't do any enforcement work of its own."
5,Rare Glimpse Into Interpol,"A rare and unique glimpse into Interpol, and, in particular, into the secret work undertaken to combat human trafficking. A thoroughly absorbing read for both the aficionado and the layman. Interpol has been the subject of many investigations by the US Dept. of Justice and the European Council and here Bannon reveals in his personal account some of the reasons that the secretive organization has been suspect. True crime readers will immediately recognize the highly-detailed specifics woven seamlessly into the story and glossary that clearly could have only come from an insider. Garnished with his efforts to deal with the moral dilemma of his actions (and glazed perhaps by the need to protect those who still serve), Bannon's memoir deserves a careful reading and is a dish true crime connoisseurs will savor."
1,Duped the best,"Give Dilley aka Bannon the credit he deserves. He duped many. His name should stand next to that of Victor Lustig, the man who sold the Eiffel Tower - twice!"
5,Rough South Korean background,"I must admit having lived for eight years in the area this book is based around, It is sadly true there are many carachters of similar stature that are portrayed in this book.You really feel for the man in the situations he comes across. An absorbing,honest account of bravery of a man in extreme circumstances. A very good account of an undercover cop. Worth buying."
1,Obvious hoax.,"I heard the author briefly interviewed on the radio when the book came out and thought he had an amazing story. When I got the book and started reading I soon realized it was only a story and he was a very bad fraud. Nearly all the claims were incredible and virtually every one seemed concocted to cover the author in cheap comic-book glory. I imagine it's easy enough to find out if he's fluent in Korean, but beyond that I don't believe one other claim he's made for himself. And now he's ""Doctor"" Bannon? Let me see the transcripts, otherwise I'd bet that's bull too. I'd believe the Gong Show guy was a CIA hitman before I'd believe this clown."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,"What a horrible movie!!! Disjointed plot, could not care less about any of the characters. Truly a disservice to the Original 26 Zatoichi films which were excellent. A waste of 2hrs!!!!!!!!"
2,slow shipping,"The map is fine- but even though I ordered it 14 days in advance, it didn't arrive in time for me to use on our vacation. So when I returned home, I had this package with a useless map in it that I paid over $8 for in cost (with shipping and handling, etc.) There is no excuse for such slow shipping in this day and age, especially for a $4 map."
4,The Helmsman goes Racing against the League,"The Third novel in the Helmsman series has ex- Fleet officer Wilf Brim down on his luck. But as luck would have it, his friends and enemies combine to allow Wilf to become the fastest pilot in the Universe.Though by this time the reader is starting to see repeat paragraphs of descriptions, the writing is good enough to allow one to escape into an adventurous tale of racing and derring-do. Though the end of the book is entirely too predictable, the descriptions of technical detail and flying prowess are entertaining in their own right.I hope they reprint this book as it is part and parcel of a fine series. Besides, how many references to material in the Helmsman series have you seen in recent Sci-Fi movies and TV shows (8 by my count). The writers are reading"
4,ALMOST all the best,"this would be a 5-star cd if ""the goonies 'r' good enough"" was on it, but for some strange reason it's not. what makes it even worse is that the song isn't even available on any of her other albums or on any compilation albums. why is it that some artists and record labels feel the need to put a few new songs on their ""best of"" albums at the expense of songs that, in cases like ""the goonies 'r' good enough"", were top 10 hits? it makes no sense. note to sony music: the next time you put out a cyndi lauper hits album, please make sure to include ""the goonies 'r' good enough"", or at least put it on a compilation album. if you're going to put a new song in the place of a song that was a major hit, at least have the courtesy to make the song you're leaving out available on some other album. otherwise, this is a good cd; an 80's pop diva singing (most of) her biggest hits."
4,Solid Cyndi...but the best?,"This is a great collection. Is it the best depends on what songs you just gotta have. The basics are here. Even though more songs are from ""She's So Unusual"" than any other album, I could still take another or two. It was her ""masterpiece"" after all. Now if you're dying to get ""Goonies R Good Enough"" you'll want the Essential collection. It's roughly the same as this, swapping a few tracks. For years fans have wanted her Vibes movie song ""Hole In My Heart (all the way to China)"". To the best of my knowledge that's found on the Japanese import version of ""Twelve Deadly Cyns"" or the Australian 2-disc collection ""True Colors"" and 3-disc ""Great Cyndi Lauper"". It's also on a ""Hits of 88"" disc somewhere out there. At this point it's clear we need a 2-disc ""Very Best"" collection. I'm sure that's not far away..."
5,"One Of The Best Collections Of All Time,","THIS CYNDI LAUPER CD, IS A GREAT ONE, AND SHOULD BE OWNED BY EVERY ONE OF US .ITS A COLLECTION INCLUDED HER CLASSICS , LOVELY BALLADS , AND AMAZINGLY PERFORMED DANCE SONGS , WICH MAKES IT A GREAT CD OF ALL TIME !PERSONALY THIS ALBUM IS WITH ME WHEREVER I GO ,"
3,A Good Even CD,"This is what I call an even CD, meaning the only good songs were even-numbered tracks--hey, I like all the even tracks except for ""I Drove All Night"" and ""Sally's Pigeons"". So basically, I like alot 5 of the songs on the CD, but they are really terrific songs! Especially ""Time after Time""."
4,Where is this kind of innovate artist today?,"Cyndi Lauper has an unusual child-like voice. I like her passionate version of ""What's Goin' On."" It's the best track on the album."
3,Average,"The Cd was very average. It was not bad ,but it was not the best either. It is just a typical album. I still enjoy listening to it though. The tunes are very cathchy and eventually you will find yourself singin along with the album."
4,A good compilation,"I really like this compilation of songs but still I really miss the songs ""The goonies 'r' good enough"" and ""Hole in my heart"" but it is worth to listening to, actually a quite good album"
3,HD Quality Just OK,"Good movie, but I thought the HD quality was poor. A very soft and frequently (especially in the dark scenes) grainy picture.Of course, we can't blame the special effects quality on anything but the age of this film. I guess I'm spoiled.One to rent, for sure, but I wouldn't buy it, especially not to show off my TV. I've seen standard-def DVD's that looked better."
3,The missing part...,"""Around the world with Orson Welles"", is great material for film buffs! Welles is directing himself, with usual flamboyance and visual flair. It does, though, seem somewhat overprized, especially considering that one of the six shorts is lacking! The back cover claims that ""the last episode (Third Man Returns to Vienna) has been lost"". This is not true. I taped it from the German television station ZDF some years ago, in excellent condition (better sound/picture quality than the materials on the DVD, sadly.) There it had the title: ""Viva Italia"". Apart from the misinformation and incompleteness of the release, it's especially sad for Welles fans because the Vienna episode is probably the best and most interesting of his semi-documentaries! Returning to the Harry Lime persona is just one of the highlights.. I still recommend the DVD though; thes travelogues are great fun!"
3,Viva Italia,"A small retraction: the Orson Welles documentary ""Viva Italia"" is NOT ""Third Man Returns to Vienna"", but another great episode! It centers on Italy by telling the story of Gina Lollobrigida, also presenting a.o. Vittorio De Sica, whose great actor/director skills is implicitly used as a Welles parallel. It's a dynamic and truly wonderful episode, and should have been on the disc. The Image disc is still overprized, with it's sadly sloppy transfer and sparse presentation."
5,Classic Short Horror Fiction,"An excellent collection by a lesser-known writer of shorthorror fiction, this volume contains one of my all-time favorite short stories in any genre, ""The Harbor-Master.""Buy and read this book!"
3,"Interesting, but not the best.","It pains me to say anything bad about some of the most amazing musicians. I can't recommend the Bach, and especially the Satie album enough. However, this Mozart album is a mess, to me. It's a bad marriage/juxtaposition of jazz combo with string orchestra. They really never seem like they belong together. It is disconcerting. I think the project would have worked much better with the combo exclusively. With the strings remaining basically unchanged, it pulls the listener in too many directions. I can really groove with the combo, and have enjoyed so many of their productions, but the choice to keep core elements unchanged was dizzying to me. Because I know these pieces backwards and forwards; to hear the core with occasional jazz licks was an odd mess. I would really like to hear it re-done without the string orchestra. Then I think the concept might shine through."
2,Kinda ticky-tacky,"I'm not well pleased with the construction of this machine. The paper guide does not slide easily, opening and closing the backdoor trap to allow paper jams to be unjammed (which happens more frequently than I'm thrilled about) is not easy to maneuver. Also, it has not been my experience that this printer is easy on ink. Quite the opposite. And I've given up trying to print a full color page. The top half of the page looks fine, and then it all turns purple/reddish. And as somebody else pointed out, the software for printing to CD's is woefully inadequate. I've had this printer for six months. I bought the wrong printer."
1,Avoid Buying for CD Printing,Do not buy for CD/DVD printing. Worst software I have ever encountered. Worst customer support I have ever encountered. Took mine back. Received a full refund.
2,Piece of crap.,"To start, this printer eats ink like a fat kid at the buffet. I saw a cheap HP Photosmart D5160, and considering that my previous Photosmart 7660 lasted me three years, I jumped on it. It was a false economy in terms of both the massive ink consumption and subpar quality. The blacks simply don't look right out of the standard cartridge- kind of a blueish middle gray, even when excluding the color cartridge. This isn't something you'll only see when printing B&W; photos- text looks kind of nasty too. Of course, HP would prefer that I purchase the Photo Black cartridge, which I'm sure would help. However, it's ridiculous that I have to buy the Photo Black cartridge to get decent-looking text and graphics.I'm about ready to punt this printer off the nearest bridge."
1,Lasted One Year,"I don't know if it's because it was a refurbished printer (bought on another site, not Amazon), but this printer lasted 1 year. I've had problems with it immediately, but I really can't complain much since it only cost me $40.00. Paper jams easily and when it does it's a huge pain to access the rollers and pull the paper out. The sensor is bad so if you ever open the cover and close it, the sensors will still say the cover is open. You have to unplug the printer and then plug it back in to make the error go away and print again. Today the printer died on us completely displaying MULTIPLE error messages, none of which are listed on the HP website."
1,Piece of junk,"I made the mistake of buying this in a hurry, because my Epson died at a critical time, and I needed a printer urgently. so I drove across the street and grabbed the first Mac compatible printer that was reasonably priced.This has been a POS, absolutely the worst printer I ever owned. Unreliable, jams frequently. Guzzles ink even on low-ink settings. Reqires frequent tinkering to keep it running. Today stopped printing the bottom half of every line, and HP's diagnostic software and website tells me it is working fine.Only had it for 2 months, and I'm done. I will write off the $100 I spent on it and it's cartridges as experience."
1,worst HP printer ever,"This is the worst HP printer ever. It takes hours aligning and realigning itself, what I call, ruminating, before you can print something. A really nightmare. Sometimes you can take 10 minutes to start printing a CD, before the printer is ruminating or because it blocks and you have to turn it off.When it prints, the quality is OK. But if you don't have hours to waste waiting for a printer to print, run away from this piece of crap. I regret every minute buying this printer."
1,"CD photo printing...HELLO, HP...","I won't go to the trouble of repeating the earlier post about how you MUST print text on top of your photo...I just want to echo his dissatisfaction with it. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD...THE BOX ITSELF SHOWS A FULL-PHOTO print on a CD. This is just flat out false advertising.I'm taking mine back to the store. I would recommend against purchasing this, dear reader, if the CD printing feature is important to you."
1,wow,"This will give you a headache. It's all written in some Englishman's offensively stupid sounding version of the Irish accent: """"An' they all wint into the coort an' had the bit an' sup, an' made a thraty forninst the King av Galway. It was the great war that was in it, the Siven Kings wid the King av Galway, an' bate him out o' the counthry intirely.""McAnally, D. R. (David Russell) (2011-03-30). Irish Wonders The Ghosts, Giants, Pooka, Demons, Leprechawns, Banshees, Fairies, Witches, Widows, Old Maids, and other Marvels of the Emerald Isle (Kindle Locations 239-240). Kindle Edition.It's unreadable. They may be good stories, but there's no way I'm reading this."
2,Not Impressed...,"This was the first book I have read by Ms. Ranney. I didn't really enjoy the book and I felt that the story line faltered from time to time. I did like the characters however, I felt as though they weren't developed enough. However, I will try another of her books before I decide whether maybe it was just me or the book itself."
3,It was is not at all like the typical V.C Andrews story.,The book was ok. I was surprised at how much different it was compared to the rest of the books she wrote. I think it was more for a teenager or young adult. I am probably not going to read the rest of this series.
2,disappointing,"I liked Butterfly better, but neither one was all that great. The story was kind of boring until the last few chapters, and then when it finally gets interesting, the book ends. I wonder if all of the orphan books will be basically the same story line, just different character. If so, there really is no point in reading all four books. The author should have just started the series with the Runaways."
3,"Good, but missing authors tell tale secrets","I enjoyed this book, but it really is lacking in the area of secrets. I am used to the author building up to the secrets. A short read, but nevertheless a good one."
4,An lonely orphan looking for family love,"Crystal, an orphan since birth just got adopted by a couple in their mid 30's. How will her life be like? Will she find the love of a family that she longs for? This novel is very interesting that makes me want to keep on reading. So be sure to catch this book and get ready for the stunning ending by V.C. Andrews."
2,O.K.,"I did not like Crystal at all. I thought she was kind of snotty and had a big ego on her. The plot was good and stuff,but I did not like the character at all. I also didn't like how quickly it ended. up until the last few pages,Crystal finally said something about it finally feeling like a family. And then they go and die. I figured the author would go more into being a family for at least more then one paragraph. I think that way it would have been more sympathic if it would have gone into them feeling more like a family."
4,"I really liked the book, but I read it too fast!","I really liked this book and I was very moved and toiched. The only thing is, I read it fast because I just could not put it down so now I'm stuck waiting for Brooke to come out and it seems to be taking forever!!! please have it come out soon!!!"
3,I miss the real V.C. Andrews,I don't like the way that these books are being written. I have been a faithful V.C. Andrews reader since I was about 12. I haven't missed one yet. This was a quick reading story. But that is all it was...a story. I need to read them for more than one day to really get into them. I like to savor them because I can relate to them. They began the conflict but left everything unfinished. They leaving me feeling like I have paid for a peak into the lives of the characters but I caould only peek. AS fast as you an blink it was over and I felt like I had missed something. I want the real V.C. Andrews back!!!
2,hmm,I thought this book was okay. It didn't exactly suck but I feel that if they made it longer it would have made a little more sense. Its like once you get to know the characters the book ends.
2,Second Orphan,"Crystal is an intelligent girl, who is an orphan. She is adopted by a couple, Karl and Thelma Morris and quickly adapts to their lifestyle, even though her adoptive mother is living in a world of soap opera and romance novels. Crystal even has a boyfriend. But then, her chance for happiness is taken from her, and she is alone in the world again.This is the second book in the orphans series, and it's not very good. None of the books are, the writer uses poor metaphors, which try to be sophisticated, but fall flat. However, like Butterfly, some good scenes and good characters make up for all the shortcomings, and believe me, there are a lot. I read the Wildflowers series, also, but I didn't like those girls, the way I like the Orphans. They aren't as human, somehow. Try the series, at least once, and remember, VC Andrews is dead. This is just a ghost writer, and if you don't believe me, look at the small print in the front cover."
4,This book is fun and easy to read for teenagers!,"After reading the first two of this series, ""Butterfly"" and ""Brooke"" I felt I had to read on about the interesting lives of orphans. I really felt like I could read it because in some ways it was easy to relate to! They are around the same age as I am (14), they have trouble with their parents, go through tragedies and speak their mind just as a regular teen. (They even have boy trouble.) I would definately reccomend this book to teens who are not into reading, (speaking as one herself.) Take it on a trip with you... you will never put it down! Have fun!!"
5,Crystal,Crystl is the second book of 5 in the miniseries called THE ORPHANS.It is about a 15 year old girl who get adopted by a nice couple named Carl and Thelma.Carl is wprapped up in saving money and Thelma is wrapped up in soap operas.She is having a great life she has friends and a nice home.Her grandparents are wonderful.But soon her only grandmam would die and she would be left with two grandfathers.But that would all end very soon.About a month later Carl and Thelma had to go and sign some papers to put one of her grandfathers in a retiring home.Crystal was at her friends house.Her friends mother got a call and asked Crystal to go get her uncles number.Crystal had a bad feeling and her feelings were right Crystals parents had both died in a car accident.Crystal could not stay because her uncles didn't have enough money and her grandfather's were to disabled and soon Crystal would be back in the system and she would soon meet one of her three best friends named Janet(butterfly).
2,Interesting,"Like Butterfly, Crystal is a interesting read in itself for a teenager audience, but is barely reminiscent of a true VCA book. When this first came back out way in 1999, I was a teenager and enjoyed this series (but not as much as I enjoyed the older ones, even the ones penned by Neiderman) Like Butterfly, Crystal is a orphan but with a different background and different talents. Her adoptive parents seem to be more normal than butterfly's adopted mom, but soon Crystal discovers that her adoptive mom has problems with perceiving reality. Still, life is pretty good, but Crystal's good luck can't last, and her parents die. Oh well."
2,Best book of the awful Orphans miniseries.,"The Orphans miniseries is easily the worst series written by Andrew Neiderman, writing under VC Andrews. I gave this book two stars for giving the heroine genuine brains rather than the usual ""artistic talents"" that VC Andrews heroines usually have (Practically all of VC Andrews Heroines are painters, singers, musicians or dancers-bearable the first time irritating when it occurs OVER AND OVER AGAIN) . I like how the heroine is shown to be rational and hardworking. It was also good to see that the guardians were nice-if flawed-people (as mostly guardians are portrayed as being Count Olaf in VC Andrews) . Everything else about the ""Crystal"" was trite, silly, badly written and I do not recommend reading the book."
4,Crystal has a new chance for a better life,"Intelligent Crystal has spent most of her life living in a not so nice orphanage. She watched others get adopted before her and tried to sever all ties off from people her age. But one day everything changes when she's adopted by two very nice people Thelma and Kurt. Kurt lives his life by a constant schedual and is very organized. Thelma lives her life through the soap operas she watches on TV and the Romance novels she reads. Crystal feels slighlty out of place in this world but finds a friend in the smart boy down the street, Bernie. But when one single act shatters all that she has. She finds herself back where she started.Like Raven and Butterfly, Crystal is a good read though a bit unrealistic. I'm looking foreward to read Brooke (the 3rd short book in the series) and Runaways (the full length novel staring all four girls.)"
4,Very Good but could've been a little better.,"I have really enjoyed this one but I wish that Crystal could've had one last kiss with Bernie before she left. It would've been neat if she could've lived with Ashley at the end. Out of all this was a very good book, good plot."
5,wanted dead or alive,"To the best of my knowledge, this was McQueen's only tv series. The quality of the picture and sound is excellent. He played a complex bounty hunter who gave money to the needy. My brothers each got the series for XMAS. Good memories.Thanks"
3,Pretty much what you expect,"This is pretty much what you would expect. A classic early television western. All of the standard oater cliches are present, but that is part of its charm. Steve McQueen establishes a persona that works fairly well throughout the series. He gets hit on the head or beat up in practically every episode. His gun and holser are the main gimmic of the show. The need to use two hands for the second shot is rather limiting, but that is glossed over in the action. If you are looking for classic TV western, where the good guys triumph, then you will find this an attractive offer. You get a lot of video to look at for a very small price. We found it entertaining."
5,Wanted Dead or Alive,"The multiple DVD set for Wanted Dead or Alive is of excellent video and sound quality - better than it was originally on television. Wanted Dead or Alive naturally draws comparisons with Have Gun Will Travel. Everyone has different tastes, but I find Steve McQueen's Josh Randall a more sympathetic and appealing character than the somewhat darker and more cynical Knight Errant Paladin played by Richard Boone. Maybe it's just that Paladin hung out in a luxury hotel between jobs and wore a black hat, while Randall is more of a blue collar working man's bounty hunter."
5,wanted dead of alive starring Steve McQueen,This series is excellent! I have been looking for the complete series for a long time. I highly recommend it for those who like the old black and white westerns.
5,A Steal,This item is a steal for fans of the early television western..For fourteen dollars you get the complete set of Steve Mcqueens Bounty Hunter...This item is not for people who need fancy cases or interviews with Josh Randals Horse...This is just packed Dvds in sleeves of one of the best early westerns...The video and sound is very good and you should get it if you like this no nonsense type dvd...
4,Flash from the Past,"I had watched a friend's copy of swasons 1 & 2, so when I could get this pretty inexpensively, I pounced. No problems at all with skipping/jumping/or anything, sound did tend to get loud or soft per DVD, but Oh Well...I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't have all the special features the individual seasons did. Season 1 had a SF regarding the color of his clothes. Don't remember details, though, that was 2-3 years ago. You'd think in a complete series collection they'd keep all the Features.Season 2 was intresting as he was a mentor to a Bounty Hunter wanna be, Oklahoma Boy Wright King. Then his character was dropped without a word. Too bad. Should've had some explanation.Season three's intro was different. I didn't care for his new hat, either. But, I'm not Steve McQueen.All around enjoyable. Get it for old times sake."
4,Great Viewing of Classic TV Western,Enjoyed watching a young Steve McQueen. I always loved this tv show when I was a child. It is a great bounty hunter with a heart show. Some of it is a little grainy but still very watchable.
5,cool bounty hunter,"what a great show! steve mcqueen is at his best in this series. i had never seen it before until my husband requested this dvd set. really enjoyable to watch. i actually like steve mcqueen better in this show than in the movies. there are interesting guest stars, too. the plots are concise and they say a lot in 30 min. i highly recommend purchasing this set."
5,Unbelievable Quality,"Before purchasing this Wanted, Dead or Alive video set I read many of the reviews (they really help and everyone should follow-up on any purchase from amazon.com). After watching the first three episodes I can only say WOW! The quality is better than when it was on network TV. One GREAT value and worth the purchase price."
4,WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE.Complete series,"Good series in black and white.Only part way through but enjoyed the episodes I've watched so far.Quality good,voices ok.Occasionally a hickup but not enough to spoil the story.Light western entertainment.Enjoyable.Each episode a different story which keeps your interest"
4,5 stars except for last dvd,Very pleased with product. Took me home to my youth. V/A quality good. Difficulty with last dvd being twitchy. Would still buy it. Service outstanding
5,Wanted Dead or Alive,"Steve McQueen is great. Got this DVD for a friend actually and he said he was very pleased with it. Again I have to thank Amazon Prime for having the right product at a decent price, Do not regret signing up for Prime at all."
5,Great series,Three years of programs. Each episode seemed fresh. Never the feeling of repitition of a previous episode. I am sorry I missed this on first run.
5,McQueen rocks! Almost 50 years later this series is great!,"I highly recommend this western series to everyone. I had previously only seen a portion of a single show, but being a Steve McQueen fan and a western fan, I knew I wouldn't be disappointed. The story lines are entertaining, the content is mild enough for my 8 year old son to enjoy....better than most of what's on television today.Ordered via Amazon Prime and was enjoying the first show less than 48 hours after ordering - got to love Amazon!"
5,Wanted Dead or Alive,The complete series at a great value. I reviewed the disc randomly and they all seem fine. I just started watching the first disc and thoughly enjoying it. Great quality package.
5,Big fan of Steve McQueen,"I have purchased the complete series of Wanted Dead or Alive through Amazon, I have watched about 30 episodes of them and I have to say that I am completly satisfied with the quality of the DVD'S and the service I received from Amazon' I have since purchased 6 other sets all through Amazon. All the infomation I needed to know prior to each purchase I found on the Amazon Web page. I was then kept up to date with all the information needed as to the booking being received, advice as to when the product was shipped and the estimated delivery date which in most cases was delivered prior to the estimated date.If I was to make one negative comment about the above (Wanted Dead or Alive set) it would be about the plastic case that the disc's were in, this was very badly damaged, case only ""not"" the DVD'S, even with this in mind the set still deserves 5 stars rating to me. One very happy customer."
5,Great Job Mill Creek,"I'm impressed; the quality of these disks is amazing. MillCreek may've started out with questionable quality with some of their public domain titles (the first season of Robin Hood comes to mind), but for classic black and white Western fans, this Steve McQueen vehicle is wonderful. I'm only on the third disk, however, I've notice almost no blemishes, speckles, streaks, hissing, etc that you expect to get from a low priced product. In fact, this collection rivals bigger name companies like Universal and MGM. I bought this without having ever seen the series, but I love Westerns, and I was willing to take a chance on such a low-low price. Amazing. Great Job MillCreek."
5,Satisfactory purchase,My husband is a big Steve McQueen fan and was thrilled to receive this series. We will by purchasing more Steve McQueen items.
4,Great Product and Great Price,For $10.00 this was well worth the purchase. This a small price to be able to go back to the 60s and enjoy a good western TV series.
4,Wanted Dead or Alive,"This is a pretty good TV seires although music quit loud at times, the stories are good."
5,ten bucks out of $$$$$$$$$$,"Wayne G's skinny on the entertainmentTen dollar signs=Highest recommendationAge appeal----------------------35-?(Most of these great actors are gone but not forgotten)Type---------------------------Western(variation of the Rifleman show, Steve has a cool gun.)5.1 Music Soundtrack-----------none5.1 sound effects--------------noneSpecial Effects (CGI)----------noneOscar potential----------------NACast---------------------------$$$$$$$(Every episode provides a nostolgic surprise of actors)Language and nudity------------NARun Time-----------------------2400 minutes!! for $14.99!!!!!

2,Wanted Dead or Alive,When I was a kid I lived 4 this show. I was dissapointed at how boring it is now.We've come a long way in 40 years. DVD case was busted up when I recieved it.
5,"Hard to find TV western featuring one of the all time great actors,A must have","The full series of this hard to find TV show from the early 60s.Well worth the Amazon sale price.Hours and hours of viewing for the family .Shows like this and the other old westerns taught the code of the west where bad occupations were still done with honor and a sense of fair play.These shows,while showing the violent side of human nature,taught moral values and showed the good side of man won in the long run."
3,Wisecracking Mystery,"We see the world through the eyes of Vic Plotz, a fifty-something, wisecracking P.I. with an appreciation for older women. Vic and his boss Charlie get caught up in the intrigue of a series of murders at Battlefield Farms near Saratoga. Vic tracks down clues and plots his own intrigues against a Harley-riding tenant and his granddaughter who's threatening to ruin his life with a visit. The list of suspects gets shorter and shorter, as they get killed off one by one, and Charlie and Vic wrap it up just in time to save the last victim. Though the mystery wasn't top drawer, the book was written in an engaging, amusing style. Vic's observations and machinations make the whole thing worthwhile as they easily upstage the main story. I'd pick up another Dobyns novel if I found one."
3,Not up to par,"I am currently reading this book and am not finding it nearly as entertaining as Mr. Dobyns' previous Charlie Bradshaw mysteries. This, I believe, is because the roles of Charlie and Victor (""Vic, call me Vic"") have been reversed. Somehow, having Victor the main character and Charlie in the background doesn't work as well, at least for me."
4,I wish I had taken better care of my toys,"American Tin-Litho Toys by Lisa Kerr is a lovely initial introduction to collecting tin-litho toys. While it may not be as comprehensive as other resources, for someone gettting started it's very compelling. The illustrations are beautiful and the book is well laid out. I saw many familiar friends that long ago went into the trash or took the trip to Goodwill."
3,TOO FEW PHOTOS IN COLOR,"THIS BOOK DOES HAVE LOTS OF GOOD INFO, BUT IN MY OPINION, MORE PHOTOS IN COLOR WOULD HAVE IMPROVED IT. I ENJOYED SEEING MANY TOYS FROM MY CHILDHOOD - THAT I STILL HAVE, ESPECIALLY THE TIN LITHO TEA SETS OF THE 30'S AND 40'S BY OHIO ART AND WOLVERINE. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK IN COMBINATION WITH LISA KERR'S LATER EDITION CALLED ""OHIO ART THE WORLD OF TOYS"", WHICH HAS A COPYRIGHT DATE OF 1998. THAT EDITION IS ALL IN COLOR. I HAVE BOTH AND AM GLAD TO BE ABLE TO SEE MORE OF WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR BY CHECKING EACH OF THEM. ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE ""COLLECTOR'S GUIDE TO HOUSEKEEPING TOYS 1870-1970"", BY MARGARET WRIGHT, COPYRIGHT 2007. IT'S ANOTHER GOOD COMPANION TO THE TWO MENTIONED ABOVE AND ALL PHOTOS ARE IN COLOR, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SAMPLE PAGES OF EARLY CATALOGUES. I HIGHLY ADVISE GETTING ALL THREE."
5,The passionate ones:,"Originally when buying ""Romancing the World: A Biography of Il Divo"" I was offered ""The Passionate Ones"" in an Amazon book deal. I started to read it and was unsure if it was based on any fact. The characters were unmistakably those of the professional personas of Il Divo, that is visual descriptions and nationalities, however with name changes. As for their families, friends and locations mentioned in the book....who knows!In the first couple of pages I wasn't too sure if I wanted to continue with this fictitious story of my heros. Then it got me in. I read it in two sittings and didn't want it to end. It was so easy to visualise the characters, possibly with the female lead resembling someone like myself. It was escapism, romantic and easy to read. As much as I hate to say it ""A real girls' book"" but one that a few men could get a few tips from!"
3,Passion? i guess so,"Reading this book, i can say that i enjoyed reading it and i am a huge fan of Il Divo so it didn't take a genius to work out who was who. but the book could have been longer, a lot more care could have been taken in the presentation and the grammar in the other languages mentioned could have been presented better for example ""Il Fontanella"" should really be spelled ""La Fontanella"".however, this writer has definately inspired this reader to write a book of her own."
4,Depardieu and Auteuil are well worth investing in,"This exciting French policier tells the story of two police commanders in Paris. One, played by Daniel Auteuil, is fairly honest who is capable of brutal shortcuts. The other, played by Gerard Depardieu, combines ambition and moral corruption. Both are up for the same promotion. The need to quickly capture or kill a group of murderous robbers pits them against each other. The result is a number of dead cops, outright murder, the protective instincts of the system and a retribution that is quick, final and satisfying.Were any two actors as unlikely to become leading men as Depardieu and Auteuil? One with a small mouth and the other with a dynamic nose. Both, however, are charismatic on the screen and are extraordinary actors. How good it was to see them together in parts they could do something with."
1,"Ick, don't bother","At first, I was very excited when I saw this album on Amazon.... but then I bought it and listened to it. A far cry from Volume 1, Live 101 Volume 2 is a disgrace of a CD, probably the most disappointing album I've bought since accidentally picking up Selena's Greatest Hits back in 1998. If you want good music, steer clear of this CD."
4,The begining,"My favorite Ojay albums are this one and the 'Backstabber' follow-up. This album did not sell well when it first came out and that was a shame. There are some excellent cuts here. 'One Night Affair,' and 'You're The Best Thing Since Candy,' I know for sure were released as singles. 'Let Me Into You're World,' Branded,' 'Looky Looky,' 'I Got The Groove,' and 'Deeper In Love, are all solid. Leon Huff really pounds the keys on 'Looky ,' and 'Deeper.' Those songs are more than enough reason to pick up this disc. You can hear the future Philly sound very clearly here. Just listen to the opening of 'I Got the Groove.' Very underrated album and songs."
2,very disapointed,"I thought this would be a good collector book but in fact its extremely weak. The book ""only"" consists of pictures with limited captions,no detailed info,no pics of different views of the items showing tags (a few lables are shown),manufactures info,constuction detail,etc. I expected to read about gear and equipment but theres nothing but captions.I would love to know the different manufactures and characteristics but theres none listed.Everything in the book you can see on the internet or ebay.If you just want single frontal pictures and maybe a couple side views than this book is your thing. My ""opinion"" not collector material,sorry."
4,Witty and touching,"I typically have little patience with coming-of-age stories or the trevails of psychodramatic teenagers, but Twins slowly wore away at my cynicism as it drew me in.You might want to shake these girls and tell them to get their act together, but Ms. Dermansky's voice is so witty and winning that you'll be anxiously rooting for them to find happiness in the end. And I have to confess, cynic that I am, I found myself with a lump in my throat by the final chapter. It probably won't lead me to seek out other novels about the trials of teenagers, but if I had to spend 300 pages with a couple of neurotic, troubled teenage girls, I'm glad it was *these* teenage girls, and I'm glad I had this author as my charming guide."
5,Double the fun...,"Beautifully written--engaging and engrossing. I read it in one sitting, and although I neglected errands, work, and some sleep in the process, I considered it well worth it. Dermansky is a writer whose craft is apparent without being in-your-face, and a storyteller whose humor gently surprises you even as her tale takes you through a range of emotions."
5,West Side Story,"This was a very nice DVD, I bought this DVD for my Dad who is 82 years old and he really enjoys it, thank you so much Amazon"
5,""" CLASSIC AND TIMELESS ""","One of my all time greats!! I've seen the play but, I have a tendency to compare it to the movie version. The movie version always seems better. A "" must have "" for your DVD collection. The picture quality of the DVD is close to that of blu-ray..."
5,I've just met a girl named Maria.....,"Its West Side Story! This collectors set is a great buy, firstly as we as a whole seem to be interested in musicals again as a film going public (Les Miserables, Phantom of the Opera etc...) but because its a handsome collectors set priced right, perfect for any home collection. The film itself on Blu-ray looks just like I remember it from the womb in 61' Thanks again Mom for taking me!Trivia fact about West Side Story: Richard Beymer aka Tony went on to be in The Longest Day with Natalie Wood's husband Robert Wagner.... (and about 80% of every name in Hollywood)"
5,West Side Story,"A older movie, but excellent, a younger generation not that familiar with musicals, should check this out.The story remains current, the performers are great,a real love story,but also about"" people"" accepting other ""people"" which sadly remains today. A beautiful, exciting movie. One you'll enjoy over and over again."
5,BAD BLU RAY MANUFACTURE,There are known issues on this blu ray release. The studio says it will fix the problems ONLY in future manufacturing. Don't buy this one right away. It's a great film and it's opening moments were accidentally mutilated by the blu ray mfr. I am surprised a mass distributor like Amazon is moving forward and shipping this bad pressing.
1,"So dated, so cheesy, so weak!","There are several old movie musicals that hold up ... this isn't one! Some of the music is good, though enormously derivative, hence the one star. Two scenes have some life in them still: the 'officer krupke' song and 'america'. Everything else is tedious, unreal, awful, sappy ... and it's full of 35-year-old 'teenagers', this movie needs a remake: with a changed ending, the loss of a few songs, better choreography (it's so bad now ... I don't understand my memory of it being exciting, at the time it came out ...), and more reality: a better re-creation of that time ... the directors did not have an eye for their own time at all!"
1,OH NO!!! THEY ARE ALSO DANCING!!!,"I liked the silliness of the characters and the unrealistic setting of New York before they started to...sing! This musical is pretty bad. I really can't see how anybody in their right mind can enjoy this torture with horrible singing and uncalled for choreography. WHY DID THEY HAVE TO MAKE THEM SING AND DANCE??? What's the point of that??? If I want to see something of that sort I'll go see it on Brodway in a theatre. Skip it, get something from this century without peoplw starting to dance in the middle of a gangs confrontations."
1,this is the worst possible movie,The singing [stinks] and the characters barely talk. It is about a...girl who cares more about her evil lover than her brother..... It's a really terrible plot not worth spending to see.
5,The Most Brilliant Musical in The History of Cinema,"If you never saw West Side Story, the most brilliant musical in the history of cinema, it is a true epic indeed. Although the storyline is the same to Romeo and Juliet, the film is acted in street style and the film teaches us about prejudice and hate. The characters are memorable and the music is sensationally stunning, especially ""Tonight"". You must see this."
2,Wrong subtitles in a musical masterpiece,Why on earth would the genius minds at MGM release a DVD of West Side Story about Puerto Rican Americans and only offer subtitles in English and French? Do they really think the tiny French speaking population in the US is a more important customer base than the huge Spanish speaking population? Most DVDs released in the US are subtitled only in English and French. Someone probably knows why. But films that would especially appeal to a Latin audience should also include Spanish subtitles.
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I EXPECTED,"It's really not all that bad, but I wouldn't rate it among one of the best musicals. The reason anyone should see this is because Marni Nixon dubs Natalie Wood, and also because of Rita Moreno, who gives a charming performance as usual..."
5,a classic masterpiece,"(...)Well, now that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at the actual movie.WSS is, as I have said, a 1961 adaption of the Shakespearean drama Romeo and Juliet. Verona, Italy becomes 1950's Manhattan; the Capulets and Montagues become warring gangs: the Puerto Rican Sharks and the white-boy Jets. The parallels are fascinating: the Prince of Verona becomes the short-tempered Officer Krupke, the balcony becomes a fire escape, the Friar becomes the wise and worried Doc - it continues throughout the movie.The dialogue is realistic and revealing, the characters real and honest. Issues such as racism, violence, and prejudice are brought to light, along with the blinding nature of young love.With incredible coreography (27 pairs of pants split in the course of filming!), innovative (for the time) and striking filming, and wonderful, catchy, heartfelt music, the old familiar story of star-crossed lovers takes on a bright, vibrant, bursting young life."
5,WEST SIDE STOY,"My all time favorite movie and musical.A must have for any musician, dancer, actor, writer, or any lover of brilliant movie and music making.Highly recommened."
4,"Wonderful movie, shipped with speed, was ""as advertized"".","No problems with this order. Everybody's happy with it , and the price was right."
2,Flawed Trnasfer to Blu-ray,"This is a review of the ""transfer"" to Blu-ray, not of the movie itself.This is a flawed transfer to Blu-ray. Buyer beware, especially if you have a large screen TV. This could have been a stellar disc, but Fox has once again destroyed what ""could have been."" I'd like to know why they keep people who ruin transfers working. I guess in the long run they make money for Fox, by keeping us suckers double dipping and waiting for a better transfer. I'm going to make sure I do my homework before I buy another preorder blu-ray movie. My Fair Lady has 10 times the problems, so don't buy until you rent. Again, if you have a small screen TV you will see much less of the problems seen on a large screen TV."
2,Natalie Wood is NOT a puerto rican!,"I purchased this movie for my sister as she loves these types of movies. Personally, I saw it about 20 years ago and was stunned that it had won so many Oscars. I could see that it had good music, but that was the only thing it had. If you want to see a gang version of Romeo and Juliet, feel free. But otherwise, STAY AWAY!"
2,"Considered classic, but...","Yeah, ""Romeo and Juliette"" in dirty poor industrial area of New York. So instead of noblemen, fighting because the whole humanity was constantly fighting that times, we have gangs of youngsters, fighting because they are just stupid. Although the result is the same, nice guy and girl are both dead. This film should have a certain strong sentimental value, if you had grown in this culture. For more fortumate ones, it's probably repelling. Well, it is for me."
3,The movie is a classic but the quality was awful,The movie is a classic so we wanted our son to see it. We own an HD TV and paid the extra for the HD version but the quality was awful and we regretted renting it through Amazon.
3,Natalie Wood shines!,"West Side Story is beloved musical but I could never get in to this classic. The Romeo & Juliet angle doesn't work in a musical style setting, it comes off corny and superficial. Natalie Wood is the bright point in this film, even though she didn't actually sing the songs, her performance is riveting, she was a special actress back then. Rita Moreno over acts, what's so great about her? West Side Story is good but not spectacular, decide for yourself on this one."
4,West Side Story,"This was my first musical to watch with the intention of reviewing, so I am inexperienced at critiquing musicals. I did enjoy watching the musical. It is usually better when you watch a movie before you know the final outcome is going to be tragic, but it was still exciting enough to keep my attention. The actors were as realistic as I could imagine one being to do such a persormance. The songs set the tempo of the mood always. It was fun. I would try other musicals based on my initial experience with West Side Story."
5,Sharks vs. Jets,"This DVD is of the highest quality.Watching the Sharks vs. the Jets singing, dancing was fantastic.Purchase it with full confidence and enjoy."
4,Not as clear as most blu-ray titles,"It felt like I was watching a DVD, there was grain every now and then. Not what you'd expect from Blu-ray. Overall, still a great movie."
5,Romantic and tragic,Good music and fantastic choreograph. Although this is an old movie it still gives a warm romantic feeling with a premonition of doom.
5,Favorite Musical Ever!,I haved loved this musical all my life its is a true classic. This musical is ageless and is as relevant now as it was when it was first on broadway in the 1950s. Romeo and Juliet.
5,excellent,This movie was the best though i felt they should have interviewd all the satrs but the movie is a -1
1,Buy the Delux Edition - Full Screen does not do this film justice,"West Side Story if the best film ever made. One of the reasons it is so great is the ensemble dance sequences. You need a 2.35 aspect ration DVD to see the full granduer of this film.This film won 10 Oscars. It deserves the respect of seeing it the way Daniel Fapp shot the film and Robert Wise directed it.The delux edition is in widescreen. It has great extra features and a book with the script and photos. The extra cost is definitely worth it.NOTE: THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SINGLE DISC FULL SCREEN EDITION ONLY BUT IS ALSO APPEARING IN DELUX EDITION!NOTE 2: Note to Amazon - you should only show reviews and rating for the specific item only. Offer to see reviews of other similar products (i.e. Blu Ray, Deluxe Editions, etc. but the reviews should be for this specific product. If I bought this thinking it was the widescreen or had special features included on another version because of a review, I would be really upset."
5,"""The most beautiful sound I ever heard...""","This was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and it is still very stirring.I just saw an outdoor, singalong presentation on a perfectly hot and sweaty July night in Brooklyn, New York. The WSS-heads were out in force and there weren't many dry eyes in the house by the end. Kinda cool when you're snapping your fingers or calling out ""Mambo!"" and ""Krup You!"" along with a thousand or so Friends.The story and songs are timeless and beautiful. Bernstein's score is a gem, as is the choreography. I also get a kick out of seeing late 50's New York, though I have to admit most of those Broadway dancing / ""gang members"" wouldn't last very long on the streets nowadays!My only problem now is that I just realized a DVD I picked up a few years ago is a horrible ""Full screen"" formatted version, and it looks pretty awful on my 46"" HDTV. But coincidentally, Amazon just sent an email announcing the 50th anniversary blu-ray pre-release.Thanks Daddy-O!"
2,Yet another Full Screen release...,Yet another Full Screen release of a great film shot in Widescreen 2.20:1. It gets 2 stars because even with half the image taken out it is still a great film.
3,I was never a fan of this movie...,"due to some facts: The fullscreen version in the 80s ruined its composition, the regrettably red filter they use when Tony meets Maria, the dialogue is ""50s"" and that it would have been GREAT to remake it in a manner more sinister, more dark manner...Some dance-sequences survive(America), as do the four young stars....But it they do remake it; be sure to get SINGIN` talents as well in the leads... Dubbing is a low form indeed....."
2,defective disk,"The DVD plays well until the ""I feel pretty"" song and then the entire thing goes haywire. I know my DVD player is OK. And I checked the disk (there are none) and even washed it off.The disk is defective. Has anyone else had this experience?"
3,Ultimately somewhat disappointing,"This 1961 film version of of Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein's stage hit begins hopefully. The camerawork, editing, choreography (by Jerome Robbins) and, most of all, music, pulsate with dazzling energy. Then, after a vibrant and exciting ten minutes, it all begins to full apart. It all becomes static and uninventive, failing to live up to the grand promises of that first reel. Most of the musical numbers (especially with the two rather bland leads) are executed with little imagination. A few of the songs fall prey to gimmicky visuals which nowadays look trite.An at times compelling drama is soured by mediocrity which should never have surfaced, given the immense talent involved here (chiefly Bernstein, Sondheim, and Robbins). What a disappointment!"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Dated, overlong, and poorly-acted, West Side Story features some nifty choreography but its plot is so irrelevent and ending so obvious that it's not exactly like there's a whole lot of suspense; if musicals are your thing you might want to watch it, but otherwise don't waste 150 minutes of your life."
1,didnt get the book,"while the movie came, the book never did so sent it back..the customer service where I bought it was very nice though."
2,Movie Review,"My wife and I finally watched the complete version of this movie, almost 50 years after it came out. What a disappointment! Other than the music and the choreography, which were very good, the overall tone of the movie is very depressing. The ending of the film is the most disappointing part; everything is left unresolved. We can't imagine what motivated the judges to rank this the best picture of 1961, just two years after Ben-Hur was voted best picture of the year for 1959. We will be donating this movie to our local library."
3,my sister and i love this movie...,"I had never seen this movie until about two summers ago. my sister and i rented it, and since then, we can't get enough. every once in a while, you just have to have a cheesy love story. the songs are fun to sing along with, the acting is good, and overall, it is just a really fun movie. if you haven't seen it yet, you should. my parents hate it, but the music is just so fun, my sister and i can't resist watching it multiple times."
5,West Side Story,"I rate this video right up there with The Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, The Great Race,Those Magnificient Men in Their Flying Machines, Pearl Harbor etc. These were great date movies shown on the giant theater screens. Unfortunately the really great theaters are gone but these great films still can be purchased on DVD media and watches in the privacy of our homes on big screen TV's.West Side Story (50th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]"
4,The Best Tragic Love Story!,"Ok, the other night, I was watching the WB, and I accidentally hit channel 41, aka Turner Classic Movies. There was a scene where Tony was singing solo and I thought ""hey! it's an earlier version of grease!"" so i watched it and it was GOOD. Maria and Tony where the original parts of the movie. I cried at the ending soooo hard cause she (Maria) lost 2 men most important to her in the same night. Out of The Sharks (the Puerto Ricans) and The Jets (the Americans) i think i'd feel ""Cooler"" as a Shark! You never expect all three guys to die. WHEN WILL THE VIOLENCE END?!? (oops!...)"
2,What A Stinker,"This movie must have went straight to DVD. The owner of a company that sells manure passes and his daughter, played by Tea Leoni, steps in to run the company. There's a nice twist at the end but if you make it to the end you are well rested. The film is one poop joke after another. It's filmed well, shot on digital with a different look, and the music is good but it is a weird little film that drags. Definitely not a dvd anyone would want to own so if you're interested, rent it."
4,A very pleasant read,"Carol Shields has an easy writing style and obviously adores her subject, making this biography a very pleasant read. We get a brief overview of her life, education and living conditions. I was a little disappointed that there was not more (more about her writing habit and more about her relationships with friends and family) - and was a little irritated by the many assumptions made (""she must have felt ...""). Doing a little research later I discovered that there is in fact very little information about Jane Austen."
2,A Bit Disapointed,"I enjoyed the first 10-20 pages because I'm hungry for any kind of info on Jane Austen. But I soon grew tired of Shields' speculations about Austen's feelings, motivations, choices, etc. She spends a lot of time trying to tie Austen's novels and characters to events in Austen's own life and after a while, it just started to feel like amateur psychology --more like a HS or college paper on Jane Austen than a well-researched biography (especially since it seemed like Shields relied primarily on other biographies, as oppposed to digging around on her own.)I wouldn't recommend this one at all."
5,brilliant biography of Austen with a refreshing look at her works,"A short and engaging biography of the beloved author that deals not in mundane details or idle speculation, but in attempting to draw a portrait of Jane, her life, and her works. Refraining from drawing tedious or melodramatic parallels between her life and her work, the biography instead attempts to understand how a spunky, quiet, reclusive spinster, alone in the country at a time of female repression and the birth of the novel as an art form, was able to write some of the most beloved, extraordinary, realistic, psychological novels of the English language. Jane was definitely a member of the suffering and unappreciated genius club. Part biography, part literary criticism, this book is a great read. Grade: A+"
1,don't waste your time,"This book should be a pamphlet. Step 1, buy a pee alarm. Step 2. use itHardly any other useful advice, just reasons why anything other than a pee alarm is a bad idea."
2,Not helpful,This book only seems to be helpful if you decide to use a bed alarm. I was trying to find a book that I could use to help my daughter stop wetting the bed naturally. I would not recommend this book unless you were going to use a bed alarm.
5,Help for bedwetting,"As a Pediatric Nurse Practitioner I see children who are having difficulty with bedwetting. I would definitely recommend this book for the parents, especially if they planned on using an alarm. The question and answer section is a great resource for parents including those that are ""special cases"". The author presents the information in an easily understandable method. A really good resource for parents."
5,An excellent book!,"This book is very informative. Every question I had about bedwetting was answered in this book. I would recommend this to anyone that has a child with a bedwetting problem. I had a company come to my house and tell me they could fix the bedwetting issue, if I gave them $2,000 dollars. This is a rip off, and this book tells you about that and any other misconceptions you may have about bedwetting. Once again an excellent book that will have your child dry in no time."
5,Great buy,"""Cute shoes!"" these shoes were a good buy reasonalby priced,the fit is accurate and they are oh so cute."
3,"Good product, but not what I am looking for","This product removed most of the hair, but never all of it at the same time. I was also looking for something alittle more permanent. When I left it on for more than 10 minutes (when the bottle only says not to leave on for more than 15) my skin stung and was sensitive. The results only lasted for a couple days and I haven't noticed the hair becoming any thinner. So, if you are looking for short term results, then this product would work well. If not, look for something else like I am now."
1,"just removes hair from top, not from the roots","Just removes hair from top, not from the roots. Its back in a week, and looks worse."
2,"Removes hair, but not better than a razor","This product works as described on the label, however the results are exactly the same as if I had shaved with a regular razor. It only removes hair above the surface of skin.Perhaps it was me, but I severely broke out with acne on my chest after it was applied. Shaving cream and a razor will give you the exact same results as this product, but without the acne and at a much lower price."
1,Burned Like Fire But Removed The Hair!,"I followed the directions but this product really, really caused me burning pain in my private regions. It does work but be careful while applying."
5,Works,"After reading some reviews on this product I decided I would try it. I was skeptical at first, but it turned out that I was wrong. I used it on my chest and it worked great. The hair will start to pull off very easily (and painlessly) after letting the cream sit on it for anywhere between 8 and 15 minutes. Rinses off nice and easy. I would highly recommend this to anyone trying to get rid of unwanted hair."
3,"A good read, but not up to Bujold's high standard","I read Komarr at a gallop, finding it great fun, but most certainly not great art. After the complexities of ""Mirror Dance,"" for instance, one could hardly help but be disappointed.I did enjoy Miles's struggles to learn how to appropriately be an Auditor -- and especially his sudden realization that sometimes he just has to follow his instincts -- and I also enjoyed seeing him develop his ability to work with others. But of course, the real fun in this novel was the blossoming if inconvenient romance with Ekaterin, who is herself quite a wonderful character.A must for the completist, but not the novel I'd give to someone who's encountering Bujold for the first time."
2,It was to layed back.,"I have read and followed Lois McMasters Bujold many books and have enjoyed everyone. But this book takes Miles' profile and twist it in another direction. In all the authors other books about Mies Vorkosigan, though his love life is there it does not affect his focus on the promblem and he would not sit there and feel sorry for himself while others did the work for him. As to Ekaterin; any women worth her salt and especially a Vor would not meekly accept her Husband malady and son's disease so passively as she did. Overall this is one book unlike the authors other books that I would not read again and again."
2,Worst of the series,"Unfortunately this book is by far the worst of the series. It's missing all the things that make the series enjoyable. It's as somber as ""Memory,"" but has none of the fun. There's little wise-cracking or sly and subversive social commentary. The plot isn't original or clever. The hero, Miles, doesn't even do anything clever or interesting."
4,an atypical typical Bujold?,"I can well imagine the disappointment of those looking for another 'Miles shoots up the bad guys' book; but for me, that's not what Bujold is about. She regularly brings her main character to realise some truth about themselves - here, it's Ekaterin's realisation that she can't go on with her marriage. Then she gives them a risky decision to take - here, Ekaterin's decision to leave - and after taking the risk, her characters stop being stymied by 'what-if' nerves and start being seriously empowered - here, in the 'hostage' situation that winds up being turned upside down (literally). If you read KOMARR as a 'Miles Vorkosigan' book, you will feel adrift; try reading it with Ekaterin as the main character, and the book falls into place with FALLING FREE and ETHAN OF ATHOS. This seems to me a fair addition to the Bujold, rather than Vorkosigan, universe, and I look forward to seeing more of them."
3,Not her best,"OK for big fans of the series but probably not the book to give someone new to Miles' adventures. Ending was fairly obvious from the beginning and littl has been done to develop characters. Still, like ice cream, even bad Miles is still pretty damn good."
3,Pretty good! - now to find more of Bujold's work,"This is the first Bujold I have read - I bought it on a whim, having seen it on the back cover of Interzone. It was only after reading quite a bit that I realised Miles was an established character - but this did not detract from this particular story. I thought Komarr pretty good - I enjoyed my reading experience and was not expecting anything particular from the characters - but perhaps this helped, given the negative comments from some of the other reviews presented here. Komarr was good enough for me to look out more of her work; the story is engaging, the characters are good, the science is right."
3,"Worth buying, but only to keep up with the story line","This book read like the first half of a *real* Miles adventure. I won't say it was a waste of time, BUT... Miles never really gets into trouble (ok-- he gets chained to a post... whoop-te-do), so we never get to see that trademark manic fast-talk double-speak wheeeeeeee boy-was-that-close that makes these books so much fun. There was one pretty big ethical dilemma, but it was over so quickly that I almost forgot about it and said that there wasn't one.On the other hand, Miles is still miles above most other serial characters these days. If you're gonna read the series, you might as well buy this one."
1,"Not a crime, but a blunder","Lois Mcmaster Bujold is incapable of writing a truly bad book; her characterizations are too brilliant, her plots too involved, complete, and subtle. But Komarr is a blunder. It blunders not in its specifics (although it is one of Lois's weakest books) but in its direction: it takes the Miles Vorkosigan series from high adventure to low soap opera. Miles does not shine with his usual energy; his love interest is tepid and suggestive of a bad bounce from the formidable Elli Quinn; in this regard the catalog of Miles' lovers presented in the book takes on an air of self-parody. Overall, Lois seems tired and distracted in this attempt to redirect the series (much as she did in Memory, a good novella transparently padded into a feeble novel). Let us hope she either rediscovers her energy and her bearings, or lets the series go to a dignified rest."
3,Intense insight into a woman unhappily married.,"The deep insights into a woman unhappily married, with all the regrets, repression, pain, and extinguished hopes are relayed with intense feeling. The writing about the woman Miles falls in love with is really remarkable.Unfortunately, it throws the book off-balance. We get nowhere near the depth of insight into any of the other characters, including Miles. They're two-dimensional, comical, in comparison. And the woman's husband is a lout through and through, which makes it too easy to take her side. Plus the woman turns out to be highly intelligent just in the nick of time.There's also a mystery in the story but much of the story is told from the unhappy woman's point of view, as she comes into her own and falls for Miles."
5,One of the best Miles books,"As Miles Vorkosigan novels go, this is one of my favorites... clean writing, tight plotting, amazingly taleneted and tragically flawed characters, and of course the introduction of Miles' future wife Ekaterin. If you're already a fan of the Vorkosigan saga, then you've either already read it or will get to it. If you're new to Lois McMaster Bujold's triumphant space opera series, i suggest that you wait for this one and start at the beginning - either ""Warrior's Apprentice"" (the first Miles novel), or ""Cordelia's Honor"" (the saga of Miles' parents). And then set aside enough money to buy all of the books and the time to feverishly read for every waking moment!"
3,The series remains fresh and readable.,"I keep waiting for this series to get stale, and every time I get a hint that it's starting downhill, I get pleasantly surprised. The book is a page-turner, incorporating the now-typical plot devices and twists, but throws in a set-up for Miles pursuing himself a wife in future installments. The new characters are a bit one-dimensional, and the female lead isn't developed enough for me to fully understand Miles' instant crush on her (though that may be as much a physical reaction on his part as anything else), but it is still a good read, and I'm looking forward to the next volume in the series."
4,Not the best in the series but still a good read .,"KOMARR,is a fast paced well executed novel by an excellent writer (Lois Bujold). KOMARR, however is not without flaws Miles seems kind of lost in this book and doesn't show his usual brilliance. We get to see very little of the peoples reaction to the son of THE BUTCHER OF KOMARR as his father is known. Throughout most of the book Miles takes a back seat to his love interest Ekaterina Vorsoisson, a married woman whose despised husband dies halfway through. Having said that the book still has many merits including a potential future wife in Ekaterina ."
3,"A new installment, but little new ground","Komarr is a further book in the saga of Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan but does not add much to the character of Miles, or break much new ground at all. As a space opera it undoubtedly works, but it does not have the freshness of Bujold's earlier works, or the more intricate plot development of ""Mirror Dance"" or ""Memory"". Coupled with a rather weak ending, Komarr is a disappointment to the avid reader of Bujold's works although it does stand on its own as a reasonable read. Let's hope for a better installment next time."
3,to cheap to fly outside,I got this for my grandpa. He is 95 and a proud WWII vet. I was hoping he would put it outside. But it is waaaaay to thin to fly outside. I wish we had room on the wall in his bed room to hang it but we don't. To bad. If you want to hang it on a wall its will work great. It is very detailed and very cool to look at. My grandpa did like it though.
4,Army Strong,Flag is flying high and proud. good for the price. not the best of quality but it does the job. not going to get much more for the low price
4,Russian Sleigh Ride,"Martha Cooley is a great young writer. Those readers expecting ""The Archivist, Pt. 2"" will be in for a surprise. She takes us for a Russian sleigh-ride through modern relationships, as carefully composed as the overtones of scent that rise from the page. It is an elegant production; well-presented and seductive."
4,"I love eMptyTV is insane, this is a great movie","The Exorcist II was released simultaneously with Star Wars hence why the movie didn't fare as well as original. Also, for the record, Linda Blair experimented with drugs(she even admitted) but would blossom into a rose(unlike your precious Brattney Sneers who is a drug addict and a lying hypocrite). So what if this movie was poorly received, does this mean Pink Floyd's Animals was a flop for being on the charts for 4 months. This movie is great! I dare Cranky to trash Pink Floyd's Animals or doesn't he have the guts!"
1,What is with the grasshoppers????????????,This sequel is not nearly as good as the first exorcist.It is not even scary. What is up with all the grasshoppers? Is this a devil movie or a grasshopper movie?
2,"Silly, but worth a look","I can't dispute that the film is hopelessly silly, but it's still worth looking at, especially if you have not seen the original. Linda Blair's scenes are unusually sensitive and the musical score by Ennio Morricone (who gave us The Untouchables and The Mission) is one of the high points. Both Richard Burton and James Earl Jones are wasted, but they attempt to lend some dignity to the overall nonsense. Approach it with an open mind as a sort of ""prequel"" and appreciate it for the back story it provides regarding Father Merrin and his earlier battle with the demon Pazzuzu; both of which are mentioned in the original novel. Again, YES it is a shameless sequel and a hopeless mess, but it's actually a lot of fun, too."
1,Just Awful,"I've been sitting here for some time trying to think of some way to describe the awful-ness of this film. I can't. There aren't enough negative adjectives in the language.Some of the worst acting, writing, and special effects you'll ever see. Nobody's heart appeared to be in this, from the cast down to the lackeys. Blair is as ridiculous and unbelievable as she was convincing and compelling in The Exorcist. And I can only assume Burton was paid a HELL of a lot of money to lend his name to this garbage, or that the casting director had something on him.This movie is laughably bad. If it wasn't so long and tedious I'd say, watch it for a laugh, but I can't even say that. Don't walk away, RUN away from this film."
3,Sequel,"4 years after her possession, has the demon returned? Dario Argento's famed composer Ennio Morricone scores this. John Boorman directed it. Pazuzu is the demon who possessed her. He encountered the devil in Ethiopia."
1,Cucumo can lead me to Pazuzu,What the hell were they thinking? The dialogue is laughable and the terrific cast is wasted.Check out Exorcist III or The Beginning instead.
2,The weakest film of the franchise...,"Much of what this film is atmospheric and compelling. The African scenes, the locusts, etc. The performances of the actors are good, including the great Richard Burton.Unfortunately, the film dumps the Christian- theological themes of the original and instead delves into a netherworld of bizarre occultism. The Catholic priest is a weak wimp, needing Shamanistic witch doctor solutions.The film's conclusion just feels silly, not scary at all.But all in all, it deserves 2 stars for it's unique atmosphere and cinematography.Jeff Messenger, author of ""The Shroud of Torrington."""
3,Okay Sequel,"This sequel to the Exorcist is not all bad. Linda Blair is back as teenager Regan McNeal, still haunted by spirits; Louise Fletcher (looking embarassed the whole time) is her psychiatrist; Richard Burton as a priest sent to investigate Father Merrin's death (Max Von Sydow puts in a cameo appearance), Kitty Winn as Regan's nanny (she spends almost the entire movie worrying about Regan); and James Earl Jones is wasted here as a formerly possessed victim. I won't give away the plot, but it does answer some questions about some things from the first flick. The musical score is haunting, but the dialogue is laughable & the cast does its best with what they are given to work with. It's easy to see why Ellen Burstin passed on coming back to the sequel. Still, it's interesting to watch."
2,Exorcist II: The Heretic,"Linda Blair reprises her role as Regan MacNeil, who this time is staying with her former nanny, Sharon, in New York, and is seeing Dr. Jean Tuskin, the owner of a hospital for gifted children. When Tuskin begins suspecting Regan hasn't been telling all she remembers about the former trauma in Washington, Father Lamont arrives and begins investigating - and with the help of Regan, things might just get a little more interesting. Or not...for this film, including some decent special effects and photography, is just plain bad. The acting is bad, the script is lacking in any sort of feeling or realism, and the story overall is just terrible. Ennio Morricone's musical score is eerie, but that's really the only thing that stands out in this otherwise dreary, horrible film."
1,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER MADE!!!!!,"What were they thinking? I don't recommend this movie at all, but it's good for a laugh. Stick with the original."
1,This movie is stupid!,I was generous to give it one stars. This movie makes no sense. I only bought it to have the whole exorcist collection. This movie is not scary. It don't have much to do with any of the other movies. It was a waste of time!
2,not as good as the first,"First of all,the storyline sucked.Second,the film didnt carry all the scary action like the first one did.Besides,I thought they should have found someone different to play the demon Regan."
2,Disappointed,Exorcist 2 is nothing compare to the first sequal. Performence of the actors is excellent but the script is awful. I bought it out of curiosity to see what will happen next.Rent it before buying it.
3,Linda Blair made me do it!,"Exorcist 2 is only a masterpiece of Schlock, but it succeeds on that level. Linda Blair, while retaining a bit of baby fat, at 17 is drop dead gorgeous! Every scene shes in, she manages to inspire breathlessness! What a doll. The plot is laughable, something about locusts, and some demon named Pazolo or something. Who cares! Richard Burton and James Earl Jones co-starred and embarrassed themselves in this turkey."
1,Boring.......,I can understand why William Peter Blatty did not do this film. The plot takes FOREVER to develop and I had to fight myself to stay awake. Exorcist II is poorly done compared to the original. Do yourself a favor and take a nap instead of wasting two hours sitting through this movie!
4,Time Can Heal All Wounds,"When I first saw E2, I said to myself at the end, ""Err, What the Hell Was That?"" Now, after seeing E3, and the latest ""Exorcist: the Beginning,"" I decided to take a new look at the Heretic.Apparently time does heal all wounds. Like a fine wine, this film has aged well. The only true sequel to the legacy. It continues the story well. Now why 4 stars? Honestly I have to say the suspense is there. The plot is continual to the first story, and the direction and cinematography is stunning. From a technical standpoint this film was ahead of its time. The acting however is campy, but that is part of its charm. This is not a crowd pleaser, but did entertain me, and if you haven't seen it for awhile, give it another chance! You might be suprised."
4,It's reputation is worse than the film itself.,"Leave off, it's not that bad! Granted, as a sequel to the Exorcist, it goes off in another direction and completely trashes William Peter Blatty's original theological debate, but the end result is a strangely compelling picture. It isn't the disaster everybody makes it out to be, but it isn't a direct remake of the original (which is what everybody wanted). Director John Boorman gives us some stunning and atmospheric shots and the film is divided between America and Africa as Richard burton investigates the death of Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow). The film is a strangely hypnotic ""boys own"" type affair. A sort of a spiritual adventure. Give it a try."
1,"WHAT,WHAT,WHAT.",you have got to be kidding. there is no exorcist movie better than the original. and that goes for a lot of movies. the original one is always the best. as a matter of fact the original exorcist is the best horror movie ever made. this one on the other hand is the worst.
2,Hmmm...,"To be quite honest, I've never actually seen The Exorcist 2 in it's entirety (is that a word?), but I've seen a good 45 mins. of it and, well, it wasn't exactly Oscar material, unlike the first one. Linda Blair is in it, so that's good, but it still is a tank...the film mainly deals with how Regan got possessed in the first film (my favorite movie ever), but it doesn't really make sense, becuase at the end of The Exorcist, Chris tells Father Dyer: ""She doesn't remember any of it"", (referring to the possession) but in this film, it's as if Regan remembers everything! All said, I consider The Exorcist 2 to be a spin-off rather than a sequel. A sequel to The Exorcist is completely unnecessary, first off because there is nothing more to be said - the story's over. Second, it's absolutely impossible to top The Exorcist - it's the best film ever made, after all."
1,beyond boring,"Bring a pillow. I was so impressed with the first movie, I ran right out hearing it had a sequal and watched this, its just God awful. Not enough profanity, gore, or horror. They tried too much to explain the origin of the demon, and explain the possesion from the first movie. Who wants a 2 hour explanation of the first movie. BTW - they are making a prequal to this series this summer, and it already looks like it is doomed to fail because they said on ET ""this one will try to explain the orgins of the demon in the first movie"" isnt that what the second one did too? they need to give it up!"
2,THIS GIVES SEQUELS A BAD NAME!!!!!!,Personally to me the exorcist 2 the heretic was the worst movie I've ever seen. In my life I've seen very bad sequels. But this takes the cake. Its so 70's.The Exorcist was made in '73 but it still is the scariest movie of all time! The music was so bad in the exorcist 2 I closed my ears!!! And the plot is too predictable. I mean what the heck could she remember 4 years later!?! In the exorcist 2 Blair refused to wear the make-up that she wore in the exorcist.So they got a stunt lady.MAIN CASTLINDA BLAIR-Regan MacNielKITTY WINN-SharonMAX VON SYDOW-Father MerrinJOHN BOORMAN-Father Lamont
1,"Skip it, see Exorcist III Instead",You won't miss anything in the storyline and you'll see a much better movie than this awful thing. Richard Burton must have really needed the money to do this.
5,the gayest freekin movie,"this is the gayest freekin movie i have ever seen! BE SURE TO GO AND RENT IT NOW! IT HAS A BAD STORY LINE BAD ACTING WHAT CAN I SAY , THIS IS AND ALL AROUND GREAT FLICK!"
3,Not Bad For A Sequel,Exorcist 2: The Heretic aint that bad but you have to agree at the end of the movie had good special effects for the 70's.Okay I agree the 1st one is better but the 2nd one aint that bad.Give it a try for this movie you might like it I did.
5,Great Attempt at the Impossible,"The Exorcist II: The Heretic recieves 5 stars as it tries to do the impossible, which is to match the greatness of the original Exorcist. Although it cannot promise to do this impossible task, it does provide for an interesting continuation of the original storyline, which is more than The Exorcist III can say. Reagan (Linda Blair) is now 18, and seeing a shrink to help her deal with the emotional troubles that came from her devil-possession earlier in her life. She feels guilty that three people lost their life when she was in her possessed state. An investigator must question Reagan about the death's and he dives into her mind to find a world of horror. Although it cannot be named a deserving sequel to The Exorcist (what movie could??), the Exorcist II: The Heretic provides an interesting storyline and a beautiful visual display. 5 Stars all the way!!"
2,"Linda, Linda, Linda!","Being a horror movie fan AND a Linda Blair fan, I was stoked when I was younger and got this movie from my dad for Christmas (what better way to say you love somebody at the holidays than with horror?). But from the very opening credits with the opera singing demon, to the scene where Linda Blair's psychiatrist calls the fire department just so they can tell her to use a fire extingusher, to the groovy little tapdancing number where Linda faints, to the bitter end... it just, well, reeked! However, there's so much going on that it still manages to entertain for some reason. I also like the part where Linda waves her hand around in the air like she's holding a lasso to kill some grasshoppers (locusts!). But the special effects in the final scene of the 117 minute version are pretty amazing. Give it a chance, it's just a good timekiller."
1,"""The Exorcist"" sequel just didn't cut it.","Poor Linda Blair. I really don't know how they could do this to such a beautiful, talented young actress. With the success of ""The Exorcist"", people probably SHOULDN'T have offered her any roles in the same movie genre. ""The Exorcist II: The Heretic"" was a revolting, embarrassing accident. I hope Linda learned her lesson!"
2,"""Exorcist II"" a Messy Sci-Fi Horror Film","The strangest thing about this picture is that Warner Brothers bothered to release it. It has everything a bomb could ask for: Terrible screenplay, awful editing, bad acting along with horrible direction.What I find most starnge is that John Boorman could not see the turkey he was creating. And at the time, this was a big budget film. Only Dick Smith's makeup and Ennio Morricone's score are worthy.There is a possibility that this film could be re-edited and cleaned up a bit for a new video version. But John Boorman would have to rethink the way this picture should be assembled."
2,The Exorcist II: The Hillarious,"Unintentional humor and over-the-top acting make this movie good, but in a cheesy way. The score and certain images are truly haunting, but most of this mess of a film is just incomprehensible. I so appreciate Chad DeFeo's synopsis of the film as he explained things that I honestly couldn't figure out when I first saw this film. I think those involved were trying to be cerebral, but ended up having a cerebral hemorrage instead.This is definitely one of those it's so bad it's good kind of films. It's also nice to see good actors like Richard Burton, Linda Blair, and James Earl Jones in something unintentionally campy."
3,THIS IS A REAL SEQUEL TO THE EXORCIST,"What's this dumb talk about Exorcist 3 being the only real sequel to the hit '73 Exorcist film? This movie has three of the original characters (and actors) from the first film! You cannot get much more real than that! Linda Blair is back and sexier and more beautiful than ever as Regan MacNeil. Richard Burton does good work with his priest part (you can tell he and Ms. Blair liked each other a lot off camera and it helps them support each other in their roles on screen). Look New York City in 1977 was a chic, funky place to be. THis movie captures that feeling admirably and it's slightly hard to follow storyline adds to the mystery."
4,Exorcist 2: the Heretic is a better sequel than Exorcist 3,"I really thought that Exorcist 2: The Heretic was a better sequel than Exorcist 3! Though the film may have been flawed, but what sequel isnt? I in some ways got just as scared watching this one as I did watching the first. Linda Blair was once again brilliant in this film. Richard Burton added a subtle chill to the film which I thought worked very well. The film over all I think was very creepy in a very psycological and subliminal sense. All the African and Pazuzu back story was a nice touch as well. The climax of the film I would say is the best part of it. I feel that the reason that this film was not accepted as well as the first is because that people expected too much from it, and also in my opinion it did not need to be like the first. I think the film stands on it's own merit very nicely! I give it four stars!"
1,Five/four star reviewers need a therapist!,"No pun intended, but this movie is so bad, it'll make your head spin! ""Exorcist II: the Heretic"" is dated, forgotten, and, most of all, atrocious! To say this is a great movie defies common sense, and all of the five/four star reviewers lack common sense. For good cinema, see ""Brokeback Mountain!"""
2,What the hell?,"Hmmmm, this is a very strange sequel that is in no way as powerful as the first. This film was'nt too bad but it did get boring. Reagen on the other hand is a very sexy girl, and Richard Burton isn't too bad as the priest looking for answers."
1,Major Disaster.,"It must have been a great idea at the time. A sequel to ""The Exorcist"" would have been decent, except that 1) Bill Friedkin didn't direct it, 2) the wonderful Ellen Burstyn is absent, and 3) the storyline is silly beyond description. There's no tension, no character development, and certainly no reason to care for Reagan McNeil, the possessed girl who's now a teenager and is plagued by memories of her past. The otherwise stellar cast members inclduing James Earl Jones, Richard Burton, and Louise Fletcher--fine actors in their own right--look like they're embarrased to be in this film. Who could blame them?"
3,Maligned sequel still an interesting viewing experience.,"Although, for good reason, voted the second worst film of all time by The Golden Turkey Awards, Exorcist II: The Heretic is still a fascinating failure of a movie and worthwhile viewing. Visually stunning, overflowing with symbolism, and featuring a far out there score by the legendary Ennio Morricone, E2tH is an interesting (albeit out of control) examination of the battle between good and evil, and of evil's tireless efforts to destroy good. See the original version instead of the hastily done re-edit for full effect."
3,TERRIFYING AND STUNNING!!!,THE TERROR CONTINUES IN THIS CHILLING SECOND CHAPTER TO THE FAMOUS EXORCIST. LINDA BLAIR RETURNS AS RAEGEN WHO IS STILL TORMENTED BY NIGHTMARES OF HER HORRIBLE EXORCISM 4 YEARS AGO AND ONLY A PRIEST AND A PSICHIATRIST CAN HELP HER FROM THE EVIL DEMON PUZUZU WHO POSSESSED HER. THIS FILM INCLUDES HORRIFYING IMAGES OF A BOY NAMED COCOONO WHO WAS A HEALER BEING POSSESSED BY THE DEMON AND FATHER MERRIN DRIVING THE DEMON AWAY FROM HIM. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS MOVIE IS PROBABLY NOT THE NUMBER 1 FILM BUT IT WAS GREAT IN MY OPINION.
3,Really not that bad,"I don't understand why people slam this sequel so much. It is no more campy or preposterous than the original, to be perfectly frank. In fact, the passage of time has actually been kinder to ""Exorcist II"" than to the original, ironically because its reputation as ""one of the worst sequels of all time"" lends itself to more positive reassessments than the original's reputation as ""the scariest movie of all time."" I watched both movies recently and felt that while ""Exorcist II"" certainly has its flaws (among them the fact that it isn't even remotely scary), all in all it really isn't that bad, and it's worth a look."
2,DISAPPOINTING..,"THIS MOVIE JUST ISNT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL, PERIOD. I WISH PRODUCERS OF FILM WOULD SEE THAT IF YOU CANT MAKE THE SEQUEL BETTER, ATLEAST MAKE IT AS GOOD..THIS WAS NOT THE CASE HERE..AND RARELY IS IN MOST INSTANCES. I FELT LET DOWN, AND THE ONLY SEQUEL THAT RANKED WORSE THAN THIS, WAS THE 3RD VERSION UGH!..I GUESS, THEY COULDNT TOP THE ORIGINAL..AND I DONT KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE TO BEGIN WITH..BUT DONT HAVE GREAT EXPECTATIONS HERE WITH THIS ONE.."
2,"scary, so, so","Not what I really had in mind, for a scary movie. I thought, that it would be scary, because the first one, scared me really bad."
2,Very complecated movie with a twist,This film is so funny that instead of screams you get laughs. The humor gets boring after the first 10 minutes so you are already bored. Richard Burton takes a look at father marrin [max von sydow] 's history. While he's in africa Linda Blair is meeting with a doctor [lousie flecher]. The film is horrid but has it's moments
2,Typical Sequel..,But if you want a good laugh - and some suspenseful sychronizing (?) watch this movie! I think one of the problems with this one is it provides just a little too much background information to the story without taking into consideration the audience - I mean - do we really care about the whole locust relationship to the scenes in the U.S.? I don't know - it was just trying a little too hard to be interesting - I mean come on - Pazuzu!
2,Leave A Good Thing Alone!!!!,"Probably the biggest example of why sequels should not be made. Usually the sequel can never match the success of the original. Why is that? Well because it's been done once already.The Exorcist is probably the scariest movie of all time and one of my personal favorites. It has everything you could ask for in a horror movie, it's creepy, scary and it's the type of movie that will stay with you and will never forget. Even more than that The Exorcist had a great plot, fantastic direction and great acting. It goes above and beyond the typical horror movie.So why an Exorcist II? I'm still trying to answer that myself. It's really not that bad of a movie it's just that it's a definite let down from the original. You won't be satisfied with this film. It's tedious, acting is sub-par, the plot is shotty and most of all it's not scary. I wouldn't suggest buying the movie until you've viewed it first."
3,Not bad but not good.,"Sometimes (for me at least) this movie is good and sometimes it is downright awful. The ending in particular is ludicrous, and there were several parts of the film where I almost fell asleep. While watching The Exorcist 2 try to think of the original film. God, if you didn't appreciate The Exorcist before you saw this film, then you WILL after it! I can tell you that.Linda Blair reprises her role as Regan Macneil, the little girl who got possessed in the original. Like in The Exorcist, Linda is absolutely stunning and does a heck of an acting job; perhaps this films only saving grace. If you are new to The Exorcist ""scene"" then by all means watch the 1973 film over this anytime. If you're not, like me, then give it a go."
3,Alright sequel to The Exorcist,"The Exorcist was alright, but in some spots seems to make no sense. Not too Bad."
3,okay sequel,this movie had a good storyline but it could have been made better. if they would have took more time making this movie it would have been a lot better. like i said it had a good storyline to it but it was made poorly. but it is no that bad a s people say it is. but it not as good as the first one.
3,Wouldn't watch again.,"This movie, lacks the horror of the original. I mean, some parts can be creepy, but its basically an action/horror movie. Action/Referring toward the end. No one gets possessed in this movie and i thought thats what these movies are supposed to be about....Exorcism/Possession... Linda Blair, is still the Queen of horror, and im glad she is in this movie. Without her, this movie would have been crap."
1,Gave sequels a bad name,"Sequels have always had a poor reputation, and Exorcist II is a strong candidate paving that highway. Lacks everything that made the first film so good. Director John Boorman even admits he didn't even like the original movie. That alone should wean you off this film. No scares or shocks, which left audiences around the world leaving the theater cussing under their breath."
2,Watch it twice,"...and it improves. Visually, this sequel isn't so bad. Get a load of all that chrome and glass in the set design and 70's psycho-babble-gadgetry stuff Ragan's psychologist aunt (Louise Fletcher) uses. And what was with the odd behavior of Kitty Winn's character? This film is visually stunning with odd-but-neat special effects. From I can gather (and believe me it wasn't easy) is that Ragan was possessed because she is the reincarnation of some african preistess who can tame the locusts? The ending is a little on the laughable side with the two Ragans but what the heck--two Linda Blairs are twice the fun."
2,Exorcist II: Confused the Devil out of me. (pun),"Regan is now going to counceling. She claims she can remember nothing of the ""expierience"", so her psychiatrist gets a specialmachine to help her remember. Once deeply entranced, through the new technology, Regan projects her thoughts to the councelor. They are very disturbing, and show of an African boy who was possessed by the same demon. This demon, Pazuzu, was exorcised by Father Merrin. A new priest, still suspecting Regan of housing the demon, flies to Africa in search of this boy who somehow fully got rid of Pazuzu. Still with me? I barely am. This is where it really fell apart. It was not good."
3,Not Too Bad,"This installment may lack the gore and excitement of the original, but you couldn't expect it to live up to that kind of greatness. Though it has nothing to make it a good movie, it also doesn't have anything to make it a bad one...it just mediocre"
2,Just Terrible,"First of all the movie makes no sense. Secondly it isn't in the least bit scary. I'll take even the most nonsensical horror flick, if it at least is scary, but this one is as easy watching as a comedy. That's really all you have to know. It's not worth it."
4,Bien meilleur que le premier,"Pour une raison bien évidente, linda blair est maintenant une adolescente et elle a tres bien grandi. Elle a maintenant une belle paire de seins qui se développera bien plus tel qu'on le remarquera dans ses prochains films tels que Savage Streets, Night Patrol et Savage Island.Pour ce qui est d'exorcist 2, on y voit une Linda sensuel aux levres pretes a donner la meilleure des pipes et surtout la derniere scene sur le lit ou elle porte un voile transparent, on peux y voir ses sous-vetements, viva Linda Blair.****"
1,The Devil Made Them Do It,"(...) This is one of the all time worst horror films ever put on film. It is so god awful from beginning to end. I can only assume that Richard Burton needed the work. Bad. Very, very bad. The music is as lousy as the film and acting. The original was good, Part 3 got it back on track, but this insult is a mess that should be buried and never shown the light of day ever again. (...)"
1,Exorcist 2 The Heretic,"Two hours of utter rubbish featuring a half sober Richard Burton wandering to himself ''I onced played played Hamlet at the Old Vic''.This very silly film is badly shot, badly acted and is not remotely scary. The Locusts look like they were recycled from Star Trek!"
3,Slow/expensive shipping,"The DVD came as advertised and is fine. Very, very disappointed in the vendor's shipping policy, however. Paid extra for expedited shipping based on the city listed and proximity to me. Also, paid full shipping for a second product, even though they shipped together. Both arrived well past the expected date and missed a critical birthday. Won't buy from this vendor again, despite the good products."
1,I tried to like this...,"I have tried multiple times to revisit this film, and find something - anything - to like about it. Yet, after all these years all I can really praise aout this film is the score by Ennio Morricone (The Good, The Bad & The Ugly (Expanded),The Thing: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack). The score is magnificent, full of all the suspense and terror that the rest of this film is sorely lacking. Performances range from barely serviceable (Linda Blair) to outright hammy (Richard Burton). John Boorman was obviously striving to make an intellectual film, but the script is such a mess that any meaning the director hoped to convey is lost. I hate to say it, but this film is a ridiculous mess. One would be much better served watching the underratedThe Exorcist III. Now that film, despite problematic studio tampering, is a worthy follow-up to William Friedkin's masterpiece."
4,It's not that bad,"Yes their were some cheesy parts like that machine and the good and bad locasts. Their were see good things like the split Regan good and bad. The movie had a good storyline just came out wrong. I still liked the movie, don't get me wrong it was no where near the first but it was okay. If you are a true exorcist fan then you shoudn't see it, but if you liked the first and are interested on contuing the story (like me) then go and see it."
1,"Fake special effects, boring, and dated","This movie isn't scary at all. In fact, it's actually funny. How could a disaster like this get greenlit? And anyone who thinks Linda Blair is hot is out of their mind. KYLIE is hot! But ""Exorcist II: the Heretic"" is not. No stars. This movie FLOPPED and TANKED in 1977, and for a good reason!"
4,The Good Locust,"Anyone who appreciates a bit of philosophy/theology, or renderings of remote Ethiopian clifftop monasteries, or the splendor of flight through exotic landscapes, or a piercing moment of realization, or the battle between good and evil, or an unbridled imagination, or the acting of the great Richard Burton and the charming Linda Blair, will certainly also appreciate Exorcist II: The Heretic. Evil targets the innocent (gleeful at their ruin) and urges society's slide toward debauchery (Sodom and Gomorrah): Who can resist the frenzy of the swarm?"
4,There was good and bad,"I came across this film a few weeks ago and took a risk on buying it. Its a common stereotype to automatically say any sequel will suck but in this case i can't say that. it has its moments of bad, but overall i'd have to say its a masterpiece in its own right. Dont get me wrong it doesn't reach the hype of the first Exorcist but this film has a different take. It really focuses on the human psyche and regan's deep memories as well as the priest's. the movie moves forward quickly and if you don't stay focused you will be left in the dark so to speak. i feel the movie would have done alot better to the general public if it was longer. it would have allowed more explanation and a chance for the viewer to grasp what's happening. Overall its worth a look if your a fan of the series, or a good film for someone that enjoys the dark things in life."
2,Exorcist II - The Heretic - The less said the better!,"Exorcist II - The Heretic was a terrible two star sequel to the original film and might have been called the version you wish you had never seen. Needless to say, there were no long lines in New York City in 1977 for this film and my wife and I were able to just walk in and sit down during a lightly attended showing.Every beautifully spoken word by Richard Burton sounded ridiculous and actually made the audience laugh. This film had some very decent cast members who just couldn't pull off the job of delivering the bad script. The only cast members who did not sound ridiculous were Max Von Sydow and James Earl Jones. While the speaking voice of Richard Burton is as magnificent as those of James Earl Jones and Max Von Sydow, his lines were just too much for us to suspend the necessary degree of disbelief and his narrative was the bad luck of the draw."
1,An Awful Sequel!!!,"Seriously, the first one was awesome, then they say it wasn't the devil in the original, but was some demon named Pazuzu. That is stupid! Linda Blair is still hot, though her hotness can not make up for the extremely bad plot of this so-called 'movie' I would NOT recommend EXORCIST II: THE HERETIC!!!"
3,2 Discs cannot be read...[2013 Updated],"I purchased this back in 2009, used it to make movie discs and used to create my system iso discs.Back at 2011, i found two system discs I created before cannot be read while I was re-installing my Windows 7 system. I am sure it works before, and I tried on various PC, but later I just had to discard those two discs.There are still few discs I have not used yet, probably coming back for more update for you guys."
1,Not work at all!,"I've been buying these discs since 2004. However the discs in the last spindle I received don't work at all! I've done the same thing as always when recording on my DVD recorder and nothing was saved. I don't mean anything but this facts coincides with the lowering of the price. A few months ago, this spindle costed $15-17 and now only $9-10."
3,not the best,when i had received the product the case was smashed but the DVDs work several of the DVDs was scratched even though i got the advertised product i wouldn't recommended anyone to order this product due to poor packaging
1,Terrible,Didn't work properly right out of the box. I have had it with DDR pads... I'm saving up for the good metal ones that take up billions of feet of space all the time because they don't fold.
3,For kids or short adults,"This pad functions as you would expect, however, it is slightly smaller than the DDR pad that came with the game. I find it hard to use because I am used to the original, however, my kids use it just fine. I do wish someone made a pad that had a hard center tho, so you could tell that you were in the center without having to look down (or miss several beats and realize you are standing to far forward, or backward), but this is true for the original as well. If you are looking for a replacement pad, or looking to add an additional pad for dual pad play, you might want to consider a different pad since the dimensions will throw you off. If, however, you are looking for a second pad for player #2, and they either A) are a kid, or B) have more dexterity than me and can relearn on a smaller pad, this is a great product."
4,Curious hardware,"An interesting and clever novel: a partial life history of an imagined French inventor-genius, Claude Page, uncovered via the framing device of Page's 'box of curiosities' found at an antiques fair. While this is a very enjoyable tour through Page's world of automata, enamelling, sound, books, watches, and other gadgets, there's a strange aloofness to the narrative. Page sails through the book, taking everything in his stride: amputation, pornography, sex, appalling living conditions, bereavement, loss, and reconciliation. Unlike Candide's 'Age of Reason' optimism, Page's attitude seems to be just one of not caring much. But despite this lack of emotion in the hero, this is an affectionate look at a machine-obsessed era, whose fascination with mechanical toys mirrors our own with electronic ones."
5,"AHHHHH...Intelligent writing, At Last!","I could probably write a treatise about this novel which is a cool stream of relief and high entertainment. Relief, as I had almost given up hope of finding a living author who can manipulate words as well as intellect. Well, here he is, ladies & gentlemen, Mr. Allen Kurzweil. Rejoice and be entertained. I'll admit, the plot has its weaker moments, but who doesn't. I am getting ready to purchase anything Kurzweil writes and recommend them to my friends who love a very good read."
1,Too densely written,"I don't understand how this book gets so much high overall praise. I must be too much the lowbrow bore to appreciate the literary heights which this book apparently achieves. I plowed through seemingly endless dense pages, full of arcane references without explanation. Nothing flowed. I tried skimming - I still couldn't find somewhere to start things better off. I had to give up."
2,"Nice case, but using the buttons isn't so great.","Case fits perfectly and looks decent but using the side buttons (power & vol up/dwn) is highly annoying. Takes multiple (or extra firm) pushes to get a response. Buy cheap, get cheap."
3,fits good but hard to access function buttons on side of phone,Case fits the phone great however the side function buttons on the side of the phone is very difficult to use. The case is one solid piece and they did not cut out the area where the side function buttons are. I would of rated 5 stars if they would fix that problem.
2,Not worth it,"Some of the ""Scott and Todd"" series of prank calls are pretty funny and my sisters and I used to enjoy them. This one really fell short though... we listened to it once and never again."
5,Underrated Classic,"Two robots (portrayed by Andy Kaufman and Bernadette Peters) escape from their factory(along with a hack-comedian type of robot) and embark on a wilderness adventure. Along the way, they create a child named Phil from spare parts, all the while falling madly in love with one another. There are a lot of disparaging comments circulating about this film, but don't let that discourage you. Perfect for the kids."
2,zzzzzzzzzz,"I agree with Peter, good film for the ""kiddies"". I watched this film when it came out and loved it. I was only 9 at the time. Almost 20 years pass without seeing it and suddenly I remember parts of the movie...and do an extensive 2-3 week search for the title. As soon as I found the title, I found a copy for sale, ordered it, and recieved it today. And painfully sat thru the 79 minutes (seemed like 179 minutes). It's just boring for lack of a better word. My favorite ""stupid lines"": ""I wonder why Catskill's battery had so much power left?"" ""Oh, he was using less powerfull jokes."" C'Mon! Will probably be another 20 years before I watch it again. Hope nobody makes the same mistake I did. (Oh, the second star I had to give because at least as a child i liked it :-)"
1,Andy Kaufman's talent is not shown here,I saw this movie when it came out...I was 9 years old...and it was horrible. I liked Andy from Taxi...FYI...not everything meant for kids is high quality stuff. This is a bore..What was Andy thinking!
1,Pretty weak family entertainment. Worth a curiosity rental at best.,"Andy Kaufman and Bernadette Peters are robots in futuristic 1995 in this little-seen 1981 Christmas release. ValCom 89045 (Kaufman) and AquaCom 17485 (Peters) meet and fall in love and even build a baby out of spare parts! Comic relief is attempted but not achieved by a Henny Youngman-type robot called Catskil (get it?). The only things this curiosity has going for it are a meager 79-minute running time and some inventive makeup designed by Stan Winston.Your kids may never speak to you again if you force them to sit and watch this, which may not necessarily be a bad thing."
2,SOMEWHAT OF A BOREFEST.................,"The film lacks a concrete story, has it's little moments, but will put you to sleep faster than Sominex. Andy Kaufman and Ms Peters were far too talented for this script. A nice film for the kiddies, not totally bad, considering the pile of makeup they had to wear. If you like Kaufman, it will make you laugh a bit, but overall it's a dog."
4,Bicentennial Beeps,"Nearly forgotten futuristic charmer starring Andy Kaufman and Bernadette Peters as two robots on a quest to find their origins. Very cool makeups, and nice production design augment a theme that again, has been imitated many times, particularly in the Robin Williams starrer, ""Bicentennial Man."""
5,"Charming, heartwarming love story in the near future.","Andy Kaufman and Bernadette Peters star in a simple story: two innocent souls meet and take to the road to see the world, falling in love along the way. The catch? They're both robots. Stan Winstons outstanding make-up and the acting skills of the two stars create a unique vision of the future and how things stay the same, the more they change. This very expensive production was a major loser (financially) but is a very pleasant film to enjoy again and again. Check out the fabulous John Williams score; once you hear it, you'll never forget it. A winner."
5,A great gift for any man!,The product arrived on time. It was exactly as described. I thought it for my caregiver. He has taken it before and is very pleased with the preventative nature of this nutrient.
2,Not really worth the $30,"He is a good likeness to the original character, however really not worth the cost. Understanding the words he is saying is quite difficult and he is very small. Had I paid half the cost it may have been a better review, but at $30. the quality is disappointing."
1,It didn't talk,"That pretty much sums it up. And there's nowhere to place a battery, so at some point (perhaps by the time I received it?) the internal power source will die.I feel absolutely awful giving this a negative review because it was given to me as a gift by a very thoughtful person who was quite proud about finding such a gift, knowing what a fan I am of LOTR. But I feel the need to disuade others from buying this and being similarly disappointed."
3,Good study of human nature,"I own this film already and would have to say that it is a rather interesting study of human nature. The ""what would I do with..."" it is a character study of the lottery in general and how people react and how it turns into cause AND effect."
3,Not Quite As Easy To Install As It Says,"Granted, my Ford Explorer (1997) is 15 years old and has not been a pampered ""soccer-Mom"" type of vehicle. But I will say, the installation of this tow receiver could have come with instructions which are clearer to recognize where the connections bolt on to the car. Fitting the bolts (I bought stainless steel SS-310 bolts to replace the stock carbon-steel bolts which come w/ the kit) through the frame of the car & the hitch/receiver involved (just me, a 1-person install) several hours of swearing & wishing I had a professional mechanic's tool set available to me (for some of the very tight spots to crank down large bolts/nuts with the typical large tool required to do so).Once installed, it does the job well."
5,A riveting plot! Undeniably powerful! Emotion envoking!,This book is written with a passion which separates it from any other. It's a story with such intensely human characters its hard to believe they don't exist. It portrays evil in its worst form. But it also teaches the reader what real courage is. Truly awe inspiring!
2,Huge Disappointment,"wow, was this bad, silly storyline, vacant characters. Mr Carcaterra has lost the respect he earned after sleepers. Clearly cashing in without even trying, well i was fooled once but it wont happen again, if he writes again I will skip it and read sleeepers"
4,"This was ""Superfriends Meet the Evil ""White Snow"" Queen!""","I cringed when I read this, but i had a good time doing so. In a way, it was like reading a movie, but so many Mind Candy books become one(I could not help trying to cast all characters in my mind, for you KNOW this is going to be a film some day). I did not like how the author tries to cover each main character's history in their own big prologue chapters, while you wait for wait for action,kidnapping tracking and drug lord chase to finally start--that was somewhat slow. However, the plot, to me, was pretty original. Gruesome and cruel, but original (which can be rare). Like I said, it's mind candy, but it IS yummy! People wich sesitive, conservative stomaches, however, might hate this. But all who loved Along Came a Spider by Patterson will love it!"
1,"Unbelievable, silly and disgusting","Unless you find unintentionally funny novels and movies fun for their own sake, skip this one. While the author tries to give you realistic cop talk to make for a gritty true-to-life feel, theplot is just so silly that you'll spend most of your time snorting at the development. The idea that a band of vigilante ex-cops can shut down a black widow's drug ring (using dead babies as mules, no less) by just being connected to their old buddies in the cop world is absurd, and badly done to boot. Dead babies indeed"
2,Uneven and very lazy at times...,"I have not read Sleepers, but I am going to guess from what I have heard that it is a better book than Apaches. Apaches has some potential, but Carcaterra is too sloppy or simply stopped caring after a while to take advantage of a couple of good ideas. Unfortunately, most of the good ideas get cancelled out by some rather ludicrous ones. Most of the main characters are just plain shallow, and they are often hard to distinguish, filled with stereotypes. While reading this novel I kept thinking that it felt like Carcaterra wrote it expressly to be turned into a film, namely with some big stars and lots of gunshots. The ending belongs in a Rambo film, and even the idea of setting it in the early 80's loses any relevence after a while. I must admit that it was quick and rather fun at times but you won't gain a whole lot from reading it. Pick up a used copy of the paperback, don't spend $25."
1,It hurt to finish this book.,"""Apaches"" by Lorenzo Carcaterra was as bad of a book as you could find these days. The story was so forced and contrived that it felt like you were watching an ""A-Team"" rerun. The characters were cartoonish in their macho absurdity. The plot was very predictable and the reader often found the characters doing things many pages after an ordinary person would have thought of it. I am a fan of such action/thriller books, but this was so dull that even the many comic book- like action scenes could not hold the reader's interest.I enjoyed ""Sleepers"" by this same author, but if that seemed far-fetched, ""Apaches"" pales in comparison. I would not recommend this book to anyone above the age of eight years old. The only surprises in the this alleged thriller was how much worse it continues to get as you read it."
1,Lazy Writer Gets Published!,"I just wasted twenty bucks and too many valuable evenings plodding through this deplorable novel. I don't really want to know what possessed Lorenzo Carcaterra, but I really would like to know what possessed the publisher to greenlight this thing. Look, I'm certainly no prude, the dead baby thing was morbid, to be sure, but underscored the ruthless nature of the drug culture. No, what bothered me here was the shallow treatment of too many characters and the lack of real depth in the writing"
4,I'm already finished.......aaaa man.,"This is the first carcaterra book i've ever read, and from what i've heard it's his worst one to date. I could not put this book down. i finished this book without even realizing that it had only been two days and i did nothing else. coffee became my new best friend, and the sun as well as the shower were as distant to me as my job and my friends. half way through reading the book, i realized that i was reading out loud and starting to have boomer's (Main Character) attitude. this is a surface reader, don't expect to be enthralled in a tale of mystery and intrigue. i enjoyed this book for all the things that others are not. this book is simple and to the point. action is its focus. pick it up."
1,Worst best-seller of 1997,"The nights it took me to read this would have been better spent clipping my nose hairs. The cheesiest, most laughable plot and collection of characters. ""Boomer"", ""Dead-Eye"", ""Pins"". You can almost see the cardboard edges. Most emotional scene has two of the characters calmly accepting that they're gonna get blown to bits in a bowling alley. Bravo, Carcaterra. Carcaterra follows a formula in this book. It's called: GARBAGE"
1,Implausible,"Too many mistakes. Eviscerating a living child with your hand over it's mouth would leave bad bruising impossible to ignore. Dead babies look dead. Carrying dead babies and getting caught carrying them would result in worse punisment than drug smuggling, who would do it? Blowing up a drug lords house and murdering twenty+ people doesn't bring legal consequences? Remember Waco? Malcolm blows up and beats the girl nearly to death because she swears at him? Nunzio is a bad guy, a wise guy like Lucia, the Apaches use him as the enforcer. Bad novel, no suspension of disbelief, tiresome and lots of extremely graphic gratutious violence."
1,I want my money back.,"This is an awful book. Moving drugs with dead babies? Oh, and I really liked the part where Boomer knocked down a building in Manhattan with a single wrecking ball. That's where I chucked this piece of trash.Mr. Carcattera-reform school is too good for a rip-off artist like your publisher. You can be forgiven since all you are is a crappy writer."
1,The worst book of this genre in twenty five years.,"From the tedious structure, through the gratuitous repulsive violence, to the implausible plot, (dead stuffed babies making three round trips on a plane --gimme a break!) this is a horrible book. Was it Mr. Carcaterras high school novel disinterred to make a quick buck in order to cashin on SLEEPERS? And oh yes, Mr. Carcaterra, Mercedes 450 SL's do not have a back seat"
5,"Gut wrenching, Hard to put down.","The plot was an excellent one at that. The only part I had trouble with was the part with the kidnapped girl and the babies, not that it's bad it's just sort of nasty. But hey nasty usually you won't be able to put it down. Good Job LC"
3,disappointing,"This is a big disappointment coming from the author of Sleepers. The characters are too broadly drawn, and the situations are all too familiar, making it pale in comparison to Brian Garfield's Death Wish or Andrew Vachss' Burke novels."
1,What a shame,"I was looking forward alot to this book by the guy who wrote Sleepers but this was terrible. It all reads like some cheesy cop movie, complete with mindless violence and stereotypical characters. What a waste of my money."
5,I couldn't put this one down,I don't really understand why the other readers didn't find it as good as I did. This is one of the most gripping books I have ever read. The action is face-paced and the dialogue kept to the minimum for maximum suspense. I strongly recommend it. This is one of the few books I have read at a sitting.
4,"Griping, disturbing, and far too real.","Carcatera has done it again, pulling us into a world of unthinkable horrors and all to real crimes. His unforgettable and unlikly heros are well developed and the action is intence. With the exception of some holes in the plot an good novel."
1,Crap!,One of the worst books I have read recently. The plot was absolutely absurd. I skimmed through to the end and then pitched it in the trash. Truly awful. Don't waste your money.
2,Dark and Disturbing...still interesting,"There are other books I would want to read in retrospect. This was rather grisly but had enough pure action to hold my interest.Still, I would get this book from a friend rather than spend money on it. Resist the temptation."
1,BAD ITEM.,"I ORDER THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON AND WHEN I TRIED TO USED THE HOT PLATE IT SHOCKED ME. I KEPT TRYING TO USE IT BUT EVERY TIME IT SHOCK ME. I AM DISABED AND CAN'T SEND IT BACK, SO I'M LEFT WITH IT."
1,"Cute, but not for everyday wear","I had high hopes for this shoe, especially in the green color. But when I tried it on, it felt super heavy and awkward...not a good feeling when you try on a cute summer shoe. The size was okay, but overall this was not for me. I returned it and I am still looking for a green sandal."
2,Cute but very uncomfortable,I searched every where for a blue dress shoe. At the time shoes just weren't that colorful. Everything seemed to be black or white. I came across these and decided to try them. They're really cute but they are the most uncomfortable shoes ever. I actually ended up not wearing them at all.
4,Love it,"As far as I can tell, it is a good deal. Arrived safe with cap and smells like Fantasy.....what more could you ask for."
4,"As a professional woman, it works!","I was of course skeptical about this the moment my daughter gave it to me as a gift. The perfume itself works for many occasions and it brings in just a touch of passion, liveliness, and desire into any single moment. The smell is mildly intoxicating but not too deep to suffocate the person breathing it in. An exotic, tropical, citrusy flavor that draws my husband closer to me the moment it gets onto my skin. He draws closer. This perfume definitely turns heads when I splash it on. This is not what you expect from a Britney Spears perfume, who knew it would come in such a great way? You really can't judge a book by its cover. Or rather a perfume."
5,Favorite smell,"I love smelling nice and one of the nicest compliments I can get is that I smell nice, and this happens often when I wear this perfume. I really think it is the epitome of a feminine perfume because it is so sweet and throughout the day has a light scent that actually sticks around instead of fading! The perfume bottle is pretty as well, but honestly I could care less if it was in an ugly bottle, it doesn't take anything away from how great this perfume smells."
4,Very Surprised that I love this scent!,"I am in my mid 30's. I am not a Britney fan at all. I received a department store sales flyer in the mail a few days ago and it had a sample of Fantasy in it. Out of curiosity, I opened it and could not believe I liked the scent. My husband and I are both picky about perfume. I decided to order a sample size off of Ebay before buying the full monty - because the last perfume we both really liked was Sensi - but it made my husband sick after a bit. Well, I got it yesterday and I still really like it. I am shocked the sweetness that it starts with does not give me a headache. I think I will buy a full sized bottle once my sample is gone."
2,"the bottle is nice. the perfume, not so great.","I first smelled this perfume on a strip in a magazine. I fell in love with both the bottle, and the scent instantaneously. I decided when I had some extra cash I would buy it or hopefully drop enough hints to get it for Christmas. Christmas came and went and no Fantasy, instead I recieved Celine Dion's fragrance. I liked the smell of the Dion but was still sad that I didn't get what I wanted. I decided to buy the fantasy for myself. Upon finding it at a makeup counter I became rather thankful I got the other. I think Fantasy smells a lot like this cotton candy spray I had in elementary school. mmmm to smell like a 4th grader again. The bottle is elegant, but the scent is juvenile. It'd be appropriate for preteens, but not grown women, then again, should I be surprised? I suppose the scent caters well to Spears' followers, 12 year olds."
2,Very disappointed!,"I am such a huge fan of Curious! and was by far, looking forward to Fantasy. But after having went to a local Sephora, I was highly displeased!! One, it was far too sweet, and secondly, it smelt quite bad. It started off smelling like Mangos, but then turned into an awful stench. Kind of like cotton candy gone bad (if that's even possible); except nothing near perfect to that delicious candy. I had actually planned on buying this perfume even before testing it, for I was so pleased with Curious. Thank god I didn't!!"
3,Just OK... for some women,"Do NOT buy this online if you haven't tried it on before.On most women this stuff smell way too slutty... maybe it's because some of them tend to spray on too much of it.My wife tried it, and it's smells OK. Nothing really special."
5,Very good product,"This was what I spected, it has a wonderful fruit smell! I enjoy when my wife us it. I fully recommend this product."
3,OK for its price... mostly,"In my opinion, $20 for 1 ounce of this perfume is a bit too pricey. However, I was looking for a practical and affordable perfume that I can wear to school or outside without ripping a hole in my wallet or making people choke. This perfume met my expectations for the most part.The scent is very sweet. My friend said that it smelled like cotton candy. However, with it a little goes a long way as it can become overpowering very fast. As I found out the hard way.I was considering blind-buying this or buying Lolita Lempicka, which was six dollars more expensive. If I could choose again I'd probably choose Lolita Lempicka."
4,Decent,Great price on this perfume and it came pretty quickly but I can't help but notice that this one is not as strong as the one I bought in Macy's and it didn't stay on my skin as long as the store bought one either. If you don't mind applying throughout the day it is fine but there is something about it different than previous ones I purchased through the store but for the price it is definitely worth it. This is my favorite scent and I get complimented on how good I smell all the time!
5,Great product for the price,I was amazed at the amount of perfume that was in this bottle for the price. Great deal!
4,Nice Perfume!,"I finally decided to purchase this perfume after noticing that I would go to smell it every single time I was at Target! I just really like the smell. It somewhat reminds me of some of the summer Escada fragrances they release every year. It's got a similar feel. The bottle is cool, although not horribly well made. Overall though I really love this perfume. For about the $30 I spent on it, I think it's a steal!"
5,.,THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PERFUMES . I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS WHILE WEARING THIS FRAGRANCE. I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERRYONE OF ALL AGES.. ON SOME REAL THOE
2,Exactly what I would expect from Britney Spears,"Fantasy is all vanilla on me. Granted, it's a creamy, sweet vanilla frosting that's has decent longevity & isn't sickly, almost like buttercream ... but sweeter, creamer, wetter. Still, Fantasy is vanilla frosting, from top to bottom. Weird because vanilla isn't even a listed note. Apparently my body chemistry just loves vanilla or this scent triggers vanilla frosting in my brain. Don't know.Some have said that Fantasy is similar to Escada Magnetism. On that we agree. However, I think Escada Magnetism is much better. Magnetism is an oriental vanilla for a sexy woman, whereas Fantasy is sweet vanilla for a coy girl.Based on reviews and on basenotes, I was expecting something less infantile & more mature from Fantasy. However, This is one of those celebrity fragrances that fit the personality to a T. For that, it is very well done."
3,Hmm ok But doesnt top Curious,I went to smell this at Macys and I didnt find it too appealing. Curious smells way better than this one. I found this one to have a vanilla kinda scent I dont know lol. I love the bottle though and Im a sucker for that. So I would probably buy it just to have it lol. Better luck with the 3rd one. ;/
1,Er...,Not really sure on how I feel about this scent. I purchased it for my sister and she wore it a few times but quickly became sick of it noting that it was too overpowering for just one small squirt. I personally found the scent offensive and overpowering. This won't be something I buy again.
5,not good buy but great perfume,"perfume seems cheap but cheaper in ebay sorry amazon its true,but great product amazon is the best though in tracking number shipping quality gotta be honest with the readers,this perfume is my fav its very sweet and girly im a candy lover and that why i luv it!"
5,My Favorite,This is my favorite perfume I've come across yet. It's a bit strong but it doesn't take long for the scent to die down a bit.
2,If u like candy then its for you,"I am not very happy with this perfume ,though i am not a fan of singer but the bottle looked kind of impressive to give as a gift to my wife.But once we sniffed the perfume it smelled more like cotton candy and chocolates .I guess we had much higher expectations from this perfume,may be due to its impressive packaging, but we were disappointed. I do not recommend to buy this."
1,FAKE,"THIS IS A FAKE PERFUME! PACKAGE DAMAGED, BOTTLE IS FAKE, SMELLS HORRIBLE. I OPENED THE HUGE BOX IT ARRIVED IN TO FIND A DAMAGED SMALL BOX OF BRITNEY PERFUME. I HAVE MY OLD BOTTLE AND THE BOTTLES ARE EVEN DIFFERENT - THIS FAKE BOTTLE DOES NOT HAVE THE GREEN DIAMOND AROUND THE TOP BELOW THE SPRAY NOZZLE. ALSO, THE BOTTLE WAS MESSED UP AND HAD LIQUID ALL OVER. YOU CAN'T EVEN RETURN IT. DON'T ORDER THIS PRODUCT."
1,Uggggggggh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"On me, this thing just smelled horribly dirty--like a body that has never been washed, & the piece of metal covering the neck portion of the bottle looked way too bright & tacky to look at when I first took the bottle out of the box!"
2,the bottle cute perfume gross!,"i saw this bottle on the internet and thought WOW!, that would be good for my teenage daughter. so i bought it and she loved it until she opened it. she gagged on the smell yuck! i smelt it too and it was disgusting do not buy this unless your interested in gross smells."
1,"Buy the bottle, loose the scent.","Why do all of her fragrances smell like shampoo? The only reason to buy it is the bottle, besides that, use a strong shampoo and you have her parfum.Again, I like the bottle a lot, so I'll give it one star instead of none."
5,One of my favorite albums,"How come this album hasn't sold zillions of copies? It is unbelievably great. So many choice cuts, each of which could make an album proud."
5,Raises interesting questions about our political system,"As a big fan of political films, I definitely found this movie interesting. I learned a lot about the historical roots of the federal reserve and IRS. I was also shocked and disturbed to learn how many countries are forced to live with US military occupation. I have never seen a serial killer film which addresses these systems head on. It is like Michael Moore meets ""Saw."" While you may not agree with this film, it is definitely worth a watch."
1,Mentally Challenged Documentary,"This movie advocates violence. Violence begets violence. Justice and peace is gained through knowledge and the practical application of same.Granted the documentary does bring up valid issues but the depiction of murdering people as a way of fixing these issues is sickening at best.The little bit of information that is in this Documentary is better learned through books such as The Authoritarians by Bob Altemeyer and Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes) by Andrzej M. Lobaczewski and Laura Knight-Jadczyk, just to name a few. A good video to investigate would be Evidence of Revision.Educate yourself, think objectively and remember, Knowledge Protects, Ignorance Endangers."
5,An Inspiration,"This book was an inspiration and a joy. The author gave easy to follow basics and direction to personalize a ""sacred house"". If you have any creativity at all it is easy to grow from the basics to your own unique artist statement.I felt the directions were very precise and the matching photos helped clarify any questions I had. It was easy to adapt dimentions to my own needs. Just realizing I could use foam core rather than wood opened a door for me (I have no woodworking skills and always avoid sewing machines).I have made my first house and I am delighted that the items I had squirreled away in various boxes and drawers are now on display to memoralize my family tree.I am a multi-media artist so it was a joy to find a use for all the strange materials and unique items (that ""spoke"" to me) I had gathered over the years. I'd like to give a genuine thank you to the author.Lynne"
3,Interesting...,"This book is an introduction to making personal shrines. I would have liked to see more examples from working artists who create shrines for their work versus craft-type examples. Overall, I am still happy with this purchase."
4,Inspirational Shrining,"Carol Owen takes us through a catalog of artists' personal shrines, that are both thought provoking and beautiful! I'm an artist, and I found this book very inspirational! I would recommend it to fellow artists who are interested in capturing their sprirituality in 3-d form!"
2,Bad instructions,"The book has 7 shrine projects. The instructions repeatedly send you back to the beginning of the book to repeat steps. The dimensions are different so you have to adapt. Pretty much a pain. Also, the dimensions given in shrine 6 are flat out wrong. Tried to find an addendum on the author's or publisher's website but none given. Cool photos of some finished shrines but be prepared for extra work trying to figure things out for yourself from the beginning."
5,Great Inspiration,"Loved this book! Lots of great ideas, I had no idea you could build such great shrines using foam core."
3,Little houses for the soul - And few variations,"This book was OK, it starts with the basic creation of a little ""house"" made out of foam core. The rest of the projects are just variations of the original shrine - some of them have drawers, some of them have little shelves, others have doors. Everything, pretty much, follows the same formula.The author takes herself way too seriously, but some of her musings are interesting. She talks about memory inhabiting her creations and about different layers of meaning. Overall, I find her aesthetic a bit ""safe"" and dull.Personally, I won't use the tutorials. I think using a cigar box and balsa wood may prove more sturdy than foam core. In my humble opinion, the most inspiring part of the book was the gallery of shrines NOT created by the author. A savvy person can probably find the same inspiration on-line."
5,The Ultimate Float,"The first time I tried out this float, I was amazed at how comfortable it was. You are a little submerged in the water, which keeps you cool, and you also have excellent back support. As soon as I tried it for the first time, I said, ""We have to get this float!"" Whether your feet are relaxed on the leg rest or floating in the water, it is the perfect floater's float."
4,"Six tracks, six gems.","If you look for earlier Benson masterpieces, I can only recommend any of the trilogy Breezin-Livin inside your love-In flight. This in flight starts with a brilliant cover version of the ""Nature Boy"", and goes on for five more tracks of high quality (listen closely to rythmic ""the world is a ghetto"" and ""Valdez in the country""). One of the Benson albums you must have, if you are one of his fans, though the sound may sound a bit ""old"" (but remember this is almost 25 years old !)"
1,"I have no complain, evangelical women told the stories.","In editorial review Dr Mac Brunson wrote ""More than half a billion women live their entire lives peeking out from behind heavy veils."" Is that right? Is not it an astronomical Christian missionary style lie? More than 70% Muslims live in Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkey, and India. Do you evangelical Christians know how many of them peek through heavy veils? Let alone wearing veil, many even do not cover their heads. If the sories in this book were indeed told by the evangelical Christian women, then these lies and deceptions make sense. I have no complain. Another slam dunk distortion by the Caner bros."
1,Jesus is my huggie-bear?,"The case stories are really interesting, but none of the Christian women telling the stories in this anthology knows enough about their own faith to make the book really captivating. It is not enough to say things like ""Jesus loves me and He wants to love you too!"" This does not work in the real world, and is probably also why Moslems in general have a hard time taking the popularized and Westernized version of Christianity seriously. To argue against Islam from an emotionalistic point of view and to do the ""Jesus loves you"" chant is to portray Christianity in a distorted way. And it is not convincing to portray God as a spiritual huggie-bear. On the contrary, Christianity is reality, it is the Truth - a Person. We need comparative publications done by people who not only care for mission - which is something this book does emphasise - but who also know Christian Theology, and is able to investigate the issues of Islam a little deeper than this book does."
1,The Mind of a Liberal,"For some reason, I was reminded of the Goetz case recently and picked up this book. The author, undoubtedly living on the upper East Side of Manhattan or in a leafy suburb, finds no kinship with a white guy trapped in a subway car with 4 black muggers. Thus he spends most of this book trying to argue that the 4 ""youths"" didn't get a fair shake. Indeed, Goetz is at fault - for not killing all four."
2,Fletcher book is a waste of time,"The book is ""Utterly disappointing and entirely uninsightful."" Much better hard information on the Goetz case can be found at Wikipedia.com and in a juror's book ""Subway Gunman."""
1,A Crime of Publishing,"Notorious for his attempts to be different, Fletcher succeeds in this book. Utterly disappointing and entirely uninsightful. One expects much more from a Columbia Law School ""scholar"" but is left unsatisfied as so often is the case with Fletcher. Better legal insights from the Bernhard Goetz trial could be had from reading old newspaper articles."
3,why won't this print?,"I've used this product at work, and I loved it so much that I decided to buy one for myself. But unfortunately the one I bought has 2 major issues, 1. the replacement tape is crazy expensive. 2. When i turn it on it says, English, on the screen for less than 5 seconds and then dies. Does anybody know what I can do to fix this?"
5,Very good value,This wood carrier is very large and well constructed. Excellent purchase for the price.
1,Wood Carrier,I am very pleased with the quality of this item. I have seen similar items sold in stores for more money that were not equal to the quality of this product.
4,Denali's West Buttress: A Climber's Guide to Mount McKinley's Classic Route,"I've just received it and haven't had the chance to really ""get into it"". BUT ... the little I've read it seems to be just what I was wanting."
2,My Goodness - What Happened?,I searched George Duke because he was on the piano for Jean Luc Ponty's Live at Donte's Hollywood session in 1969. What an awesome bop stylist! But what did I find? Schmaltzy pop. Go back in time for this guy's best stuff.
3,Not his best work,"I don't see this as George's best work, but then maybe I'm more inclined to his late 70s work. I just don't see the depth or humor in these songs to the extent I remember in his early albums. OK to have, but there is better GD work out there.Paul"
5,oldie but goodie,been a George Duke fan for years it was great to find this CD that i didn't have with so many favorites on it
3,Good Stories,The book was not bad wish it was longer there was some good stories and i felt bad for some of her friends like freddy and crystal if you buy the book you will see what i mean.
5,great book,"a must read makes you really laugh and for everyone who doesn't like it, its probably because they are exactly like kara"
5,Something to Keep you warm at night,"Kara is one gorgeous and thrilling girl. This book is full of stories that will keep you warm on the coldest of winter nights. Not to mention that it gives hope to the thousands of us 'regular"" guys out there that there are some girls who are willing to give us a shot. Much Love and Props to Pigeongirl Kara and here neverending Saga!!-Clif M"
5,Finally a Book I Can Relate To,"There are not many books written for my age group that aren't boring. This had to be the best book I ever read. It kept me laughing for the 3 hours it took me to read. The author has a vivid imagination, and wrote 22 short stories about some messed up people from Boringsville, Pennsylvania.The author totally bashes his main character Pigeon Kara and makes fun of her [trashy] lifestyle. Pigeon Kara is a girl whom you will hate most of the time and feel sorry for other times. I kept reading because I wanted to see how trashy she can be. The other goes to no end to make her out to be one shocking and disgraceful character. I encourage everyone to get this book!!!"
1,Why do iUniverse and Amazon.com cooperate with this spammer?,"The book is low-quality porn, but that isn't even the biggest problem with it. The real issue is that the author insists on spamming various non-commercial message boards to promote his book with ads that aren't even relevant to the message boards. He reposts these unwanted ads repeatedly, despite complaints, and even after administrators remove them. He is truly an incorrigible abuser of the Internet with no regard for others and no conception of the inappropriateness of inserting commercial messages where they do not belong. It's a free country and the author certainly has a constitutional right to write garbage like this book. He has no constitutional right to spam readers of other sites to get them to buy it. Amazon.com should be free not to carry books by authors who promote them through abuse and deceit."
1,There Was no ZERO STAR option,"Simply put, this is a book that makes Monica Lewinski seem like Shakespeare."
1,Horrid on so many levels.,"I was spammed on AIM by the supposed ""author"" to buy ""her"" book. Needless to say, I didn't suffer this grammar-slaughtering airhead gladly. I don't know who wrote (if you can call it writing) this utter debris of a literary abortion, but there's got to be something fishy going on.The website is affront to anything decent artistically or morally. How is such a braindead individual able to live without dying or being killed? These things keep me awake at night."
1,Buy this to encourage spam,"The work of a known spammer. Note all the 1 star (because there's no zero star option) reviews. Many mention how he spams... add to that list a fake MySpace profile.Notice all the people that found this review ""unhelpful""?Yeah, they're all from the spammer ""writer"" too."
1,A waste of time,I didn't even buy this book. I read the first couple of pages and was dumbfounded. Even giving this book a 1 star is too generous. Just those couple of pages were a terrible waste of time. Staring at a blank wall would have been more constructive. The writing and format of what I read seemed like an 11-year old's writing. Please stop advertising this on theDilly.com and using fake pictures for hot girls to try and sell it.
1,*shakes head*,This looks horrible. What's more pathetic than someone who trys to hook up with guys online? Someone who writes a book about it. Please stop spamming facethejury.com with this junk.
1,ha!,ok if you re bitching cause the book is fake or written terribly .. duh!they know it is fake they know it is terriblehey if it sells more power to the guyi personally couldnt stomach to read it but if you realize that the guy is making money you should be more light hearted
5,This is the funniest book I ever read!,"This is the funniest book I have ever read. I am not one for reading, but a friend of mine bought this book and I was dying laughing!"
1,Its sad that things like this get published,"I got this book as a gift from a friend, and truthfully found it bad, just bad. At first I didn't know whether the book was trying to be critic about the trashy/slutty way teens act nowadays or if it was actually glorifying it - visit the author's homepage and you'll see it's the second.Not only I don't approve of that, but the english level used is just low. Read the excerpt above - ""the two teens screwed"". That's the kind of language you'll have to endure through this book, and believe me, blunt is not always good. This book lacks elegance in every aspect and its not even funny.Final words - whether you are looking for something funny or for something sexy I wouldn't recommend this book. There are funnier books, there are sexier books, and most of them are better-written."
1,You're better off driving a nail into your eye.,At least that would be quick pain. This book isn't worthy of a serious review. It has to be one of the most sophomoric pieces of garbage ever written. Stay away! You've been warned.
1,Ridiculous,"Hey, little boys who wrote this book...don't you think ANYONE notices that you also wrote all of the reviews? You're pathetic, and this book is pathetic. Not even worth the paper it's printed on. I'm sorry that a couple of frat kids could get together and get something published, when there are so many decent writers in the world unable to break into the industry. Pigeon Kara is a new literary low for humanity."
1,zero rating,"This is the worst book I have ever read in my life. I kept reading thinking it has to get better, but it never did. It is a shame that trees were wasted on this book."
1,Not even worth the one star.,"Okay, I didn't buy the book but from what I've seen it would be a waste of my money. The author has no knowledge of the english language and must've learned how to write while spending all their time on the internet to get the information for the book.It isn't any wonder that the author must post advertisements on websites such as theDilly and FacetheJury. The author even made a fake website on geocities, supposedly made by the girl ""Kara"" and her ""friend"", to advertise the book. It's pathetic really."
5,Great music from a great film and legend.,A must for John Wayne fans. Great music for an epic film. John Wayne's wanted to make a film about the heros of Texas.Need I say more.
2,Mitusmi Extrenal USB Floppy Drive,"The unit itself seems to be a good unit. However... it is a terrible device for using in Windows 7 Pro. There are no drivers for it, and you can't not get customer support to answers to your correspondence, for it. So if your going to try to use it in Windows 7... for now, for get it."
2,Doesn't work for 64-bit computers,"I have a new computer (June 2012) with 64 bits, and Music Ace 2 does not work for computers with 64 bits. If you have a new computer, this game will probably not work."
