5,A compelling web of personal stories . . .,"Jo Ann Beard's book ""The Boys of My Youth"" is a thoughful collection of poignant vignette's about her evolution from childhood to adult. As you read, her stories subtlely weave their magic, leaving you wanting more. It's a book that, even in life's most busy moments, calls to you to be read.Jo Ann shares her most difficult and cathartic moments as a child, spouse, friend, and sister. She also finds a way to disclose some of her most personal stories with an objectivity lacking in most work of this kind.Jo Ann's book moves the reader from laughter, through her stories about childhood with her sister Linda and brother Brad, to tears when she losses her mother to cancer.""The Boys of My Youth"" is one of the best autobiographies I've ever read!"
5,Women Who Were Born In The Late 50's-Early 60's - READ THIS!,"This is a fabulous book. It took me a while to 'warm up' to the stories - but I ended up going back to a few to just savor the sense of 'place' that Beard puts into her stories. The ""Fourth State of Matter"" has been given a lot of attention in past reviews, and in my opinion, rightfully so. It is an extremely powerful story - one that will stay with you for sometime. Please, Jo Ann Beard, keep writing. Your voice is fresh and wonderful and mostly HONEST, boy do we need this type of writing now."
4,GREAT.,"If you graduated high school in the late 70s, early 80s and were a little on the wild side..... this book has some wonderful memories in store for you. It's when painters pants were big, long hair meant everything and riding in cars with girlfriends was so IT. JoAnn Beard tells it like it was better than any author I've read, even down to sneaking out of the house though we knew better.Put on an old Van Morrison CD, and relive some wonderful memories while reading great book!"
4,Beard's first,"Jo Ann Beard's Boys of My Youth is a wonderful journey through the author's turbulent and hilarious childhood- it slows down occasionally, but the presentation is so fresh and witty that it's easy to overlook the minor weaknesses. The true gem of the book is ""The Fourth State of Matter"", a New Yorker essay about the murders of her colleagues in the Iowa Department of Physics in 1991. All in all, a great summer read, and an author to look out for."
3,Disappointed.,"I bought this book based on the high-profile, very positive blurbs. My expectations assumed another Catcher in the Rye or Portnoy's Complaint. Actually, I found it rather boring, with little tension and a sparkle, a chuckle, a satisfying insight only here and there."
1,MEDITERRRANEAN DIET SHOULD BE ABOUT REAL FOOD !,The cover is pretty.The information should containe recipes about real food ! Not man made sweetners.I would not recommend this book to anyone wanting to eat clean.
2,Not worth the money.,"I was looking at switching from the Atkins diet. The book is fine, but the diet appeared to hard to follow."
2,Not a diet book.,This is a recipe book based on a diet philosophy but does not include enough details or instructions to be labeled a diet book.
4,Good Book,I love books and am always looking at new and healthy diets. This book is a good book if you are looking for a sensible diet and good recipes.
5,Updated and improved from his previous book,"This is an updated and improved version of his previous book on the same subject. A lot more recipes from this diet. It does not contain any new information on the ""what"" and the ""why"" of the Mediterranean Diet, but it has lots of recipes to make the diet more varied and interesting."
1,"don't waste your money, where is the mediteranean?","Thankfully my cover was damaged so I am returning it. However, I would have returned it anyway. Where in the healthy mediteranean's diet is ""low calorie sweetner"" and ""liquid eqq whites""? This is just a low calorie diet with fish, fruit, veggies and the like which you should eat anyway. It's mostly recipes which is why I was interested. The recipes however feature artifical sweetners (lots of them). I don't see where that fits in traditional mediterranean fare. They are been proven to be dangerous. So, this is really a low calorie, low fat diet with artificial sweetners. You will lose weight but will you really be healthy?"
3,Med Diet,"If you're a busy mom, I don't think this book is for you. The recipes are okay, however, they are time consuming to prepare. I wouldn't recommend this book for someone on the go. It's so important to manage your weight through diet and exercise,however, some times you need a little help. Why buy a book that can't facilitate that process. I just didn't find it cost effective or time sensitive. While there were great recipes, I personally found it to be a bit of a headache preparation wise."
3,Succeeds relatively well...,"Karen B. Chapman, The Marino Mission (Wiley, 2005)An excellent idea for a book-- write a short novel aimed at teens that contains one thousand SAT vocabulary words. Pick a subject that will probably resound with the teen population and run with it. Granted, your language is going to be a bit highbrow, but that's the whole purpose of the thing, right?Chapman comes pretty close to getting it right. The target audience will not be the wiser when she stumbles a bit trying to fit one of the words in (using ""prototype,"" for example, to describe the last instance of something, rather than the first, or an early, instance), and the plot gets a bit clunky at times. Still, for what it is, the books succeeds pretty well. Also comes with a good number of vocabulary exercises and the like for students to get the new words they're exposed to here cemented in their heads. ***"
1,One of the worst written books,In my opinion this book was one of the worst written ever. I've read over a hundred romance books and this one tops the list of the worst written. I highly recommend that if you want to purchase a good romance book you don't buy this one. I think the author of this book ran out of things to say so she threw in crap to fill the pages.
5,Enjoyable!,"This was my first Norah Hess book I ever read. I read this book along time ago, so I am writting this from my memory of the book. I really enjoyed it. I thought that Juliana was a little of an ""airhead"". I don't want to give the books whole story away, but it was very entertaining. Julianna has alot of adventures in this book, she has been married twice, but loves only one. It is worth reading, I may just have to pull the book out and read it again."
5,Nice Chain,"If you need a chain like this, this was a great price and came quickly in the mail. It is very sturdy also."
2,Exactly what it looks like,Perhaps I was fooled by the picture when I shouldn't had been. The necklace wasn't exactly what I expecting. I wanted to attach a pendent on the necklace and give as gift but it just didn't work.
5,The American Dream that will live forever with Antonetti's tenacity...,"What a story! Just finished this heartwarming and inspirational page-turner of an autobiography. Franco Antonetti is a shining example of what the American Dream can still be; with tenacity. Required reading for students, immigrants, or anyone that wants to learn how to live life in America to the fullest. Highly recommended!"
5,I Would't Die,"What a wonderful book. My husband recieved this book from Franco Antonetti himself. He had signed it on the front cover. I started reading it one evening and when I layed it down my husband picked it up. I have never seen my husband read a book completely through, but he did this one. I got my turn to read it after him and I could not hardly put it down. What a life this man has had. Some good some bad but he came through it well ontop. Franco and his wife live a few short miles from us and he an my husband are friends. I would recommend this book for any and ever body to read. I know we often think our lives were hard when we look back, but after reading this book you might think a little different."
5,The American Dream Realized,"This book provides a wonderful documentation of one man's journey to the American Dream. Born into difficult circumstances in Italy, the author learned at an early age to work hard and expect little from others. This hardscrabble early life prepared him for success when he arrived in the U.S. via Ellis Island. He learned English, excelled in school sports and worked multiple jobs to support his family while a teenager. Upon graduation, he took this strong work ethic into the business world and was rewarded. This is not to say he became fabulously wealthy, for his success is measured by much more than monetary rewards. He has experienced life as few others have and has forged friendships and memories that we should all aspire to attain more than wealth. The basic writing style gives it a simple, rustic quality that makes it all the more authentic.Reviewed by Ron Lowery"
5,Puts you in his shoes!,"I took a look at the first few pages purely out of curiousity, never intending to buy the book...but I got hooked and HAD to know more. It was well worth the purchase.The author tells the story much in the style of my own Italian grandpa. I felt like I was there beside Little Franco as he grew up and beyond. I loved when he talked about how he felt, when he walked past the statue of Mary as he carried the box of money. (A little guilt can be a good thing.)What a wonderful story of making it in America. As a second generation Italian American, I loved hearing similar stories from my parents and grandparents reggarding the family's struggles and accomplishments. God gave this author a special determination he used throughout his life. The book is an inspiration to all who read it...My son-in-law is enjoying the copy I gave him as a Christmas present."
2,"Good while it lasted, but what next ?","We have had this shredder for 3.5 years and during that time it worked well, but at times a bit noisily. Yesterday I went to give it a single sheet of paper and it failed catastrophically. It senses the paper,the motor runs, but the shredding mechanism does not move ... It seems a gear has stripped or broken. I could live with a failure at that age, IF there were any way to get it repaired, but there isn't !!! Fellowes considers these $200+ ""personal shredders"" as disposable, they do not sell spares and they do not repair them. The best you can expect is an offer to sell you a remanufactured shredder with no warranty whatsoever.I suspect that I will not buy the remanufactured model that may be offered and will buy a competitor's unit as a replacement, whose I don't know yet."
3,The shredder that couldn't get the job done,"It's a great shredder if all you have is a few pieces of paper to shred.But if you have lot's of items to shred this puppy won't get the job done. The machine will only shred for 5 minutes before it heats up and stops working. They don't tell you until you read the manual that it won't run longer than 5 min. It does do a great job of pulvorising documents and is really quiet, but if you need to shred a lot of documents you'll be shredding for quite some time. Better off getting one of those shredders that cuts you documents in bigger stips.But I have to say it is cool to see it shred paper into bits LOLMy recomendation is to try one out at a store before you make your decision."
2,High quality cobbled with a poor choose for a part,"The overall design of this unit is very nice and ""heavy"". The one real problem? There is a main plastic gear, driven by what appears to be a casy aluminum one that has a tendancy to strip out. At first I suspected that the gear was made plastic for a reason - so it would strip out in the case of an overload (it does seem to have an overload protection feature also). So, I called up Fellowes and asked for a replacement part - yea... no can do. We don't sell that part. Sad, Sad, Sad. Back into the box it went."
4,Shreds Paper Into Confetti,This shredder works very well turning paper into tiny confetti pieces. I have purchased two of this model. The first one had a defective overheat sensor. It had to be returned to Amazon who immediately sent out a replacement. I am very pleased with the second machine which operates perfectly.
3,Fellowes confetti cut shredder,"Was disappointed that it does not feed the paper through automatically--have to hold down a button to get the item to go through. However, it is a very good shredder and handles anything put into it."
4,Paper Destroyer,I've had my Powershred for a week. It absolutely pulverizes whatever I put into it. The fragments are so small that bin emptying is infrequent and painless. I would buy this unit again.
5,Great purchase for busy home use,"I've seen descriptive words such as saw dust, confetti, etc, but I wouldcategorize the produced mulch as 'wood shavings'...about the size of agrain of rice. Too fine to place in the paper recycling container (paperrecycling prefers large or long (grained) paper. I've been reading onvarious ways to recycle the chads produced by the Fellowes MS-450cs andwill try mixing them in with the yard waste and seeing how it decomposes.Notwithstanding all the above, this is a great shredder. Quiet, 5-7 sheetsat a time, finely shredded, relatively low cost....what more can one ask for? a big thumbs up!"
1,DOA,"Plugged in, nothing happened, not even a beep or flash of light. FYI, I saw a demo at Ofc Max, this thing is really truly quiet. If you get it, plug it in right away and test it."
4,Shreds into tiny confetti diamonds,"This is a great shredder! It even shreds credit cards, CDs and DVDs into tiny confetti. It does overheat after about 10 minutes of continuous use (I was cleaning out my office), and takes a while to recover (couple hours), but my fear of identity theft has certainly decreased."
5,Great Shredder for price,"The MS450Cs is super quite and pulverizes paper. I would not recommend it for someone that has a lot of shredding to do at one time (needs a cool down period after about 10 minutes or so of shredding...I don't recall the exact threshold time just an estimate) or if you have bulky items to shred (7 pages is its limit).It can handle the majority of our junk mail without having to open the envelopes, but there is the occasional item that is too thick and causes it to jam. Since we use it at our house we have neither mass shredding nor much bulk so it is perfect for us. Not overly messy when you open the bin, holds a lot of shredded paper, and is super quite...highly recommend for the home or small office."
4,"Good shredder, safety feature not so good",I have been pleased with the performance of the shredder so far. We are able to shred about six pieces at a time and it will run for about 10 minutes before it has to cool down. I was disappointed though when I realized the auto shut off that is supposed to occur when a finger touches the area around the opening does not respond to little fingers. It appears that toddler sized fingers do not register. I am going to contact the company to find out if this is a known malfunction.
1,Didn't Work Out of the Box,"I purchased the Fellowes Powershred MS 450CS after a fair amount of research (trying to balance cost with features). It is one of the few shredders with security level four for the price. We received the shredder, but right out of the box, we weren't able to shred anything. Finally, we were able to shred some paper, but we don't know what we did to get it to work. I called Fellowes today and after giving them information about the machine and following their instructions, they will be sending a replacement (which will take 7-10 days to get to me...meanwhile, the shredding pile mounts). Overall, extremely disappointing. I can only hope that the replacement works. It is very quiet and I like the separate shredding container for the credit cards and CDs/DVDs."
1,Poor Customer Service,"This item was not purchased through Amazon but it's only fair that others should know about the extremely poor customer service. Another reviewer had the same problem: it was working fine for two years; then, one day the shredder began to make the worst sounds. Contacted customer service - they issued a claim number - had to call again - sent a reminder e-mail - still, no response. As of this writing, a one-star is the best rating for this equipment."
1,Not for credit cards,"This may be a good unit for paper, but is NOT suitable for credit cards. I put one credit card into this unit and it only strip cut it (versus confetti) and my account number was still readable. This was not acceptable, so I returned the shredder. After further research, I ended up purchasing the Royal 1610X Confetti-Cut Continuous Form Shredder which pulverized my credit cards as well as paper into the same tiny unreadable confetti bits."
1,Product button does not work,"In the past I've owned several cheap brands of cheap cost shredder but their blade becomes dull quick . I purchased the MS450 hoping it would last a few years. We seldom use the MS450 except for tax season and do not shred more than 5 or 6 pages (regular paper) at one time. It is a seldom used paper shredder at my home.Since it has never jammed, we never had the need to press the reverse button to put it in reverse mode. During my maintenance (oiling) for the shredder, the Fellow web instruction said to push the forward button and then the reverse button . Sadly the reverse button did not work. Didn't even think of testing the Reverse button when I purchase the shredder two years ago. For a shredder costing over $200. and having it break down so quickly with seldom usage, it was not a good buy for me and I am very disappointed."
5,This is the shredder for home you want!,"I received my shredder and was so pleased with all its features. Simple features like wheels, and awesome shred size (near dust-like), and quiet operation, not to mention it being quite a handsome machine (if that's possible for a shredder), have made me a happy home office camper.Amazon, as usual, provided quick excellent service!"
3,Unfortunate experience 1st time round,"Unfortunately ONLY after 2 weeks of purchase this Fellowes shedder MS-450Cs completely stopped working. I was extremly disappointed since this was bought for home use, obviously I received the lemon. However, after reading Amazons return policy of only partial refund on purchases when boxes are opened. I called the manufacturer and they sent a replacement. Hopefully this replacement will last a lot longer than 2 weeks since it is quite expensive I would like to have it long enough to review in about 6 months. I do LIKE the look of the product and what it does to anything that goes through it. I will be returning the lemon-one purchased through Amazon back to the manufacturer."
2,Disappointing for the money,"I owned this shredder for about two and a half years before it gave out on me. I kept it well lubricated and fed it a very weak diet of 3-5 papers at a time at most (more than this and it will take an absolute eternity to shred, moving the paper up and down very slowly as the shredder just doesn't have the power to get it done). The cut is very good, the safety features are nice, but the durability just isn't there. After discovering how much out-of-warranty service on my shredder would cost, I took it apart to see if I could fix it myself, only to discover that all of the gears and inner workings were made of plastic. The screw drive connecting the motor to the shredder blades had worn down until it had no teeth. I wouldn't buy another Fellowes without seeing inside the thing to determine its durability -- their mascot may be a bulldog, but the plastic parts inside wouldn't hold up to one."
5,Best Shredder Not Found At the Office,"I absolutely adore this shredder! I've had it at least 6 months, and haven't found anything to complain about yet. The ""shreddings"" come out as small ground up chunks about the size of pepper corns (at the largest). The pieces aren't recognizable since they're ground up and not sliced up. Don't inhale when emptying out the bin, though due to the dust cloud that can form when disturbing the paper shreddings."
1,Did not work,My product did not work at all. I checked my power outlet and everything. I read the instructions (and I never do that). My shredder did not work OUT THE BOX. I purchased from Warehouse Deals. I'm highly disappointed. Waste of my time and money. I'm returning and expecting my refund.
4,Good Shredder,"...as other have said before me, this shredder is quiet, very quiet! It also shreds paperwork into TINY pieces. Don't overfill the basket though as the small pieces make a terrible mess of things and are hard to clean up. Handles 5-6 sheets at a time easily but can handle more with each pass. I simply find the unit seems to be working to hard to handle 10pgs at a clip, especially if I expect the unit to live a very long life. I am perfectly happy with this shredder and would certainly recommend it to anyone for home and small office use which is what I use it for."
3,J.C.,"This shredder in layman terms is simply O.k.,reason first the cut is excellent and is very quiet.I dont like that one must hold the button continously for shredding and it is slow.IT can over heat,but one must wait for the thermobraker to reset."
3,great book,"Gulliver's Travels is a great book with many adventures. Gulliver, the main character, takes many trips to different islands, where he learns the viewpoints of other people, on him and his country. He goes to a country of people that are only six inches tall. He begins to think that they can do no wrong. He soon learns that they are very corrupt individuals. He tells them about how his government works and they compare each other's. Gulliver thinks that his is the ideal government after this. The next stop for him is on an island of giants where he finds a better government than his. He is actually kind of embarrassed of his government. This occurs in book two. In book three Gulliver is brought to a floating island. He does not really interact with people like he did in the other books. He is really just Swift's mouthpiece. In book four Gulliver meets the horse like Houyhnhms. He starts to want to be a Houyhnhm. All in all this is a pretty good book and everyone should read it sometime."
3,A Review Regarding the Illustrations and Maps,"There have been many reviews regarding this classic so I will focus my review on the Kindle version stating: `with illustrations and maps.'The illustrations did come through but were a little on the small side. Each image was roughly 3 x 3 or smaller. I wish they would have covered the entire screen. There were only a couple maps which weren't very detailed. All in all, I really liked the drawings and feel they added to the enjoyment of the story. I think it is worth the extra $1 to purchase this version.My three-star rating refers to the illustrations in this Kindle version. The person or persons who published this title could very easily go back into the file and enlarge them. I think readers would love to see Milo Winter's work a little clearer.~ Jenna"
3,Brutal assessment of human society,"Swift dissects and roasts practically every element of modern society from physicians to kings to lawyers. His marvellous people and creatures highlight mankind's frailties and evils in a direct manner which is frightening.I enjoyed reading this book, but I found the author's criticism of his society so accurate as to be uncomfortable."
4,All time classic.,One of the good books. Got it for my children.They are enjoying it thoroughly on my Kindle (Keyboard).Recommended.
3,Gulliver was often rude and he lied about Britain's method of planting and taking care of colonies,The whole book was great but I was disgusted at Gulliver for the contempt he had for humans after he was kicked out of the talking horses land.
2,So happy I did not pay for this...,"I had to give up on this book about 2/3 of the way through. I was just getting too tired of looking up ""Old English"" words as I read. (Should mention here that the New Oxford American Dictionary that is included on my Kindle does make looking up these words pretty easy. However, I was using it so much that I would lose the thread of what he was saying.) I'm reasonably well educated, read a lot and enjoy it. However, this book was not anything like what I expected. I though it might be a children's tale but it turned out to be a political treatise."
3,Overrated,"I missed reading Gulliver's Travels as a child, only to read it as an adult and discover that I hadn't deprived myself of much at all. As a children's tale, Gulliver's Travels is moderately interesting, with a few brief moments of humor. It is neither riveting nor drab, but simply - average.Despite the preface of the Baronet Books edition, which claims that Gulliver's Travels is a ""masterpiece of satire"", I found the irony to be blatant and trite, and, as a result, predictable and boring.While certainly not a great read, it was worth the half hour I invested in it (barely).tpmMarch 18, 2002"
2,Are you kidding me?,"Who ever said this book was not just for kids is crazy. This book isn't for kids period. It was too long, too confusing, and too boring.It was enough that he traveled to a place with tiny people and another one with giant, but the land with the talking horses was too much. Like someone is going to learn a language(spoken by horses) in less than a year,or at all. This book was Awful!"
2,Formatting Problems,"I was excited to read this book, but a couple of chapters in, I wasn't really getting into it. It didn't help that the formatting did not break the large chunks of text up. I like to read with a fairly small font to make my page turns less. Because paragraphs weren't broken up, I was having a hard time moving along in the text correctly. I didn't really cry over the formatting when I was having trouble finding the book interesting."
2,"Too much hyp for an ""okay"" book","I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence."
2,"Ok , but not as great as I thought it would be better",I had to read Gullives Travels for a book report and I thought it was very boring
1,Boring,"I do not understand how this became a classic, with long, drawn out descriptions of government and boring opinions. Not even very well written."
1,"Ummm. . . yeah, so sure.","Well, I tried to read this book because I had to read a 12th grade reading level book because thats the level I read at, but I was bored from the start. It starts in words, but by the third page all I was seeing was ""Bla bla bla bla bla bla bla. . .""Then the little house blew up in flames and my interest was rekindled. But, disgustingly, I was turned off by this book because he peed on the flames to put them out. That is just totally gross. I immediately put down the book and honestly wished I could burn it.If you want an actual GOOD book, try Lord of the Rings or The Count of Monte Christo. Don't bother with this rubbish that somehow was published."
1,Great books do not exist,"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax."
5,I have always loved Swift!,"This is not now and never will be a book for children. Yes, the Lilliputians are enchanting, however, there are numerous crudities in the book. What you must understand is that this book is satire, not play. Read ""A Modest Proposal"" if you are unsure about what I am saying. Never take Swift from the surface, he requires a mighty dig into the historical background if you are to gain full measure of his genius.After seeing the movie, my daughter was telling her 8 year-old son that she would get the book for him to read. My husband and I nearly jumped out of our skins, telling her that ""Gulliver's Travels"" is not appropriate for a child. I have read it many times. It probably is time for another read."
5,One of my all time favorites,This is one of my all time favorite books and reading it on the Kindle didn't dissapoint me. Timeless classic that I can sit down and read anytime.
4,this book is amazing,i like to read this book i also watched the movie the book tells more to be 100% honest i have not finished the book
3,glad it's free,First time I've read the whole book but sometimes this version can be a little difficult to read since you can't see ahead in the book
4,enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book, definitely from a different era, but quite entertaining. For the price, an excellent choice. :)I downloaded the book after watching the movie starring Jack Black, and feel that the book provided more entertainment time."
3,starts promosing becomes difficult towards the end,"The book starts out very promising but begins to start stalling towards the end. I struggled with as the different journeys become more more cumbersome. I am sure the author has his reasons for the way he wrote the book but not something I will go out of my way to recommend for others. For me, one time was more than enough. The beginning is great though."
3,Mixed feelings,"This book was brilliantly written relating the human nature of the time. Whoever criticizes it for the lack of character development, does not fully understand the nature of the book. It is a satire, Swift purposely wrote as little as possible about the main character so we won't relate to him. His purpose was to compare the creatures he met on each of his voyages to the English government and politicians. Even though he was pretty accurate about the politics of the time, he was too negative. Yes, it is the human nature to be corrupt, greedy, selfish and all the other things he mentioned in his book. But people also express kindness, love and compassion and he failed to convey any of that in his work."
3,"Worth dusting off, except for Book IV","On a dreary January day, I ran across some old High School literature books and decided on re-reading Gulliver's Travels, this time for enjoyment rather than a grade.Now that I have a little more knowledge of European history than I did as a teenager, I did indeed enjoy a fair amount of the satire in Gulliver's voyages.However, I've got to say that his fourth book with the talking horses slowed me down so much I feared I wouldn't finish the book. Swift moved from satire to moaning and griping about everything human. Wasn't he a priest? I would've expected a man of God to at least have run across one or two worhty persons who might have uplifted him a little.The starry-eyed gushing over the Utopian horses and unrelentingly negative portrayals of mankind gets very old, very fast. Almost made me wish I hadn't picked up the dusty old book in the first place, but I'm glad I did for the sake of the first two books."
2,Buy the print edition -- there are no notes in Kindle,"This is supposedly an annotated edition, with critical commentary. You may want something like that, as I did -- an annotated text where you could read the editor's notes as you go through the novel, learning historical and literary background to the text as you read it. Great -- except the Kindle edition doesn't let you read the notes! You see the tantalizing asterisks -- so you know, for certain, that a commentator has appended some information on philosophical, political, or literary background -- but you can't see it! If you want the notes and commentary, you need to buy the hard-copy print edition. There is no reason whatsoever to buy this Kindle edition (an un-annotated one is available for much, much less money)."
2,mayb its just me,I have read many many books and just could not get into this one. i wish i liked it because i enjoy the classics but this one isn't for me.
3,Okay Book,"I read this book after watching the movie. For me, I enjoyed the movie better. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick read."
4,Jonathon Swift at his best!,An excellent edition to my kindle library.I can take it wherever I go. A wonderful classic sure to become a favorite!
3,"Properly formatted, at least.","**This review pertains to this specific Kindle edition**Well, this version is at least properly formatted, as opposed to one of the others, however it lacks a TOC and illustrations. 'Course, what do you expect for free, right?Classic book, of course. Please see elsewhere for reviews of the writing."
4,An Epic Adventure,"It is difficult to review a ""classic"" novel given the weight of history and the number of reviews already written. However, this is an enjoyable adventure with very imaginative settings.I agree with earlier reviews that the first 2 voyages are the more interesting, or at least not so laden with political messages. The later two are more interesting ideas for alternative fantasy settings but are bogged down by too much preaching.There is a gem in here for Studio Ghibli fans, the third voyage was inspiration for a popular Ghibli movie."
4,"Good condition, entertaining book.",I bought this book for a class I was taking and I actually enjoyed it. It's a pretty entertaining book and I'm glad that I read it. It came in very quickly and was in great condition.
4,Worth taking the trip,Political Satire written centuries ago doesn't allways translate to the present. However if one follows our current political leader and pundits it looks a lot like when Gulliver visited the Lilliputians. Just like in lilliput everyone is an expert with their talking points. Not a great amount of dialog but much to think aboutR HemingwayPast Twilight
5,Gulliver's Travel is the Best.,"This novel is one of the few that I have ever read, but it is so far the best I ever read. This is not just for young adults but also for kids. I liked Jonathan Swift use of his imagenation to come with all the great stuff that came up with for this novel. I also like his usage of satire to mock the politics, religion, and society of his time. I always like to read thing that is making fun or moking some thing, and novel does just that. The one thing that I did't like was that it was tough to read, I had to use Masterplots to help me understand it. But it is still a good novel to read, I think it is so good that someone should make it into a cartoon, and also make a sequeal."
3,Reading the Annotations on the Kindle version is annoying,"Gulliver's Travels is fantastic, but the fact that the myriad of footnotes have no hyperlinks to them (so you have to search the location number every time) is quite aggravating. The book version is still superior."
5,Gulliver's Travels,"I recomend this book, especially for kindle since this is a classic novel and the paper book is so thick and heavy."
3,Alright book,"While it's a well-known classic work, the tedious lampooning of the travelogue genre became wearying after too long.Good features: formatted well for the Kindle. No misspellings or punctuation errors, and highly enjoyable read. The read aloud function works great!"
3,Interesting,"Gulliver's Travels is definetely an interesting read. The changes pace frequently because the book is divided into four books according to his different adventures. Each book(adventure)gives you a differnt view of people and questions about humans and humanity. The last book was my personal favorite-it's a very differnet spin on humanity from the other ones. Overall, it's a very good book and I would recommend it if you need a book to read or have only ever read the children's version."
3,My first book,"Well ,Gulliver's Travels is my first book, i think is very interesnting. i don't finish to read the book yet!"
2,not enough Jessica,"I don't know about the CD version of this album, but on the tape cassette, the song ""Jessica"" is only 4:49 minutes long instead of the 7:05 version we all know and love. I'm not that big a fan of the Allman Brothers but I love this song -- it's the only reason I bought this tape, in fact. How disappointing to discover that it trails off to nothing after the second section. The rest of the tape is fine, however, with live versions of ""Stormy Monday"" and ""Statesboro Blues."" Note, however, that the CD version has a live version of ""Hot 'Lanta"" and the studio versio of ""Trouble No More"" neither of which appear on the cassette version."
1,CLEP General Exams 17 Full-Length Practice Exams,"I recently took the Humanities CLEP exam. I used the REA CLEP general exams manual to study, review, and practice test exams to prepare for the exam. I found less then 10 questions on the exam, (out of 140) which were even close to the questions and answers in this REA test manual.Needless to say, I didn't pass the exam. I got close ..score 46, but needed 50. I highly recommend using the CLEP OFFICIAL test manual for your primary test preparation. I am going to call REA and advise them their test manual is not worth using for the Humanities exam. I spent $30 for this manual plus $60 for the exam and $15 for theTesting center; $105 spent, and nothing to show for it. I hope this helps othersThxJeff Zigeler"
2,BETTER THAN MOST BOOKS,"THIS BOOK IS GOOD FOR GETTING A GENERAL IDEA OF HOW THE TEST IS ADMINISTERED, AND THE REVIEW QUESTIONS WERE DISCUSSED IN GOOD DETAIL, BUT WHEN I TOOK THE TEST, THERE WAS MAYBE A HANDFUL OF QUESTIONS THAT ACTUALLY PERTAINED TO TO THE REAL TEST. NOT A GOOD BOOK FOR REVIEW, BUT GOOD TO GET AN IDEA AS TO HOW HARD THE TEST IS GOING TO BE."
3,okay,it works well but clep is difficult..i recoment instead using one of the online services. for a small fee that will build a format to teACH AND QUIze you a no brainer
2,CD test scores inaccurate,The CD was only helpful as a test-taking practice tool. The scores were inaccurate and therefore gave a false indication of the overall performance. Use the book to review test results as this is the only way you will know how you did.
3,UK vs USA Aviation Rules,"While this book is well written and quite informative, it should be noted that the author is a British Airline pilot and came up through the UK aviation system. If a person wanted to understand the process of becoming an airline pilot in the US, this book would not be as useful as it might have been. Had this been clear in the content description, I would have purchased a different title. Again, this is no reflection on the author, who is quite good."
5,An Excellent Clothing Stain Fighter,"This stuff is great for getting out all kinds of clothing stains. It doesn't take much of the product to spray on to the area. A little goes a long way!My only request is for the product name to be changed in Amazon. As it read s right now, it looks like one would be receiving ""5 GALLONS"", when it reality, it's ONE GALLON. Extremely deceiving."
5,Amazing stuff,"I had tried other products to help get laminate glue off a cement sub-floor, I had purchased a couple of different products from Home Depot and Lowe's, without any luck. I saw a youtube video on this stuff and decided to give it a try. So glad I did! this stuff is amazing and worked so well! No overpowering oders and got the glue up with no trouble at all!"
3,Beware Ugly Noise Reduction,"I haven't much to say about the music itself except about the two tracks I was willing to buy. 'Something' and 'Elanor Rigby' are OK rearrangements, except for the distracting drummer with all the reverberation, and the off-key brass solos in 'Something'. Both rearrangements repeat parts of the original tune a few too many times, with little variation.As for technical quality, I noticed ugly MP3-like artifacts throughout the entire tracks. From my personal experience with the technology, it sounds like simple FFT-based noise reduction. It especially muddies up the quiet stringed parts. Somewhere along the line they must've screwed up the recordings and decided to use noise reduction to fix it up.But in the end, they're not unlistenable. I like 101 Strings' ""Something"" the best, mostly because it's one of my favorite Beatles songs, and I'm a sucker for big swooping, sappy orchestra music."
1,RIPOFF!,"Okay, I'll make this short. Really short. These 14 songs are all Beatles masterpieces. I'm not denying that. But this isn't even The Beatles. This is something like 101 Strings. Yeah. It's not The Beatles. Buy '1' or perhaps any of the Anthologies, or might I recommend '1962-1966' or '1967-1970.' All are great buys for the Beatles fan. Or, if you can find it, dig up the rarities album 'Hey Jude.' But DO NOT buy this.NOT RECOMMENDED."
2,"OK for small, straightforward projects only","Bought this as a first wet saw for two small bathroom stone tile jobs. For making straight cuts it works well enough. However, the cheap plastic rip fence broke after about 15 cuts, after which I had to clamp it down. Never had use for the miter gauge, but it looked like accuracy might be an issue--again, a cheap-looking plastic item. Yes, this saw will make 45-deg bevel cuts, but only at the end of a piece, not in the middle, and with pretty poor accuracy. All in all, I was frustrated but getting by with this saw--it's still cheaper than renting for more than a day or two--but then when I was about 80% done with the project, the motor simply quit halfway through a cut and would not reset even after a ""cooldown"".Overall, I'd recommend this only for very small projects where you want the time flexibility of making cuts over a few days rather than renting."
3,Little saw that does a lot,Good tile saw for the homeowner at reasonable cost. A bit messy to use but good results. I've been using it to cut granite tiles and it worked very well.
1,No replacement blades available!,"This saw works great...until you need a new blade! It is impossible to find a replacement blade. My kitchen floor is half done and now we have to purchase a new wet saw to finish the job! I even called Amazon help and they couldn't find a match. The blades at home depot & lowes are 5/8"" and will not fit as this is a 7/8"" saw. This is an older model and replacement blades are not even shown on the plasplugs website for this model.Update: Plasplugs is out of business. I tried contacting both the domestic and international offices. Then with a little research I found that they closed their doors. There is no where to purchase the appropriate blades. The ones on Amazon are 1/4"" too large. I give up - this is a disposable unit and now we have to purchase another one somewhere."
5,"Cheap,Cheap,Messey,Cheap,Great Saw!","It looks cheap, feels cheap, messey, cheap cost with great results. My first electric tile cutter, still going strong after several years of cutting, same blade. Of course it cuts slower than a large saw, it is real slow on thick marble. It's all plastic, small motor, treat it as such, keep it clean-especially the table top. I've used this to complete several projects/rooms. I do not use this as my main tile cutter, I use a regular scratch and break type for straight cuts, their quicker and less messy than a wet saw. When I have to cut out sections, small or thin pieces I use a wet saw, this wet saw. A Home Depo saleman recommended it to me, if it did't work, bring it back, I kept it. I've read another review, the company is out of business and replacement blades are not available???? I haven't tried to find one yet. If it's true???? It still was money well spent, especially vs a rental....When this one burns out, I'd buy another one, if not this one, one like it."
2,Good live performance for a lousy audience!!!,"I really liked the music on this CD although the sound quality is not exactly the greatest. By way of disclosure, however, I generally do not care for live recordings because of the background noise and untimely applause. In terms of distracting applause, this CD is over the top--some in the audience get overly excited in the middle of some songs and start clapping. That ruins it for me. I wish I could find a studio recording of this CD."
1,Don't read this book...,"Let me say that I am a huge Bukowski fan. I absolutely adore Factotum, Women, Ham On Rye, Hollywood and Post Office. Unfortunately, this book is not of that caliber. In fact, Hot Water Music is so bad that it's hard to read. The stories aren't funny, are very repititious, and are pointless. I would say this book is about as bad as Pulp, which was horrible. Bukowski is just not a fiction writer. He's only good when he writes about his personal experiences. If you have exhausted all his novels and are looking for some decent Buk, South of No North is okay, but forgettable. Notes of a Dirty Old Man also is interesting, even worth rereading. But let this be a warning: Hot Water Music is terrible and so is Pulp, so don't buy them."
5,INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO BUKOWSKI,"As an ardent fan of Bukowski and Henry Chinaski, this by far is my favorite book by Buk. If you haven't read any Bukowski but always wanted to, this is perhaps a great place to start. It's a series of short stories that give you a taste for Buk's writing. You'll either love him or hate him. There's no in between. But if you love this book, then you can look forward to many other fictional pieces by Buk that will delight you. Either that or after about three chapters you will want to go out and get drunk, or get laid! Enjoy! Buk is a God!"
3,hank's so so short stories,not my favorite of hank's short stories but interesting enough to read all the way thru
1,REMAKES!!!,"This set, '20 Best of Rockin' '70s' does feature 20 great songs. Madacy released this set to commemorate the best era of rock and roll. Artists like The Atlanta Rhythm Section, Sweet, and The Grass Roots are featured on this compilation.So how does this collection measure up?PositivesNone.Negatives-EVERY SINGLE SONG IS EITHER RECORDED LIVE OR WAS REMADE! I don't have a problem with live versions. In fact, in most cases, I prefer the live versions over the studio, but the live versions featured here are godawful.-The sound quality could be a lot better.Don't waste your money. Buy a quality 'Best of '70s Rock' CD. But stay far, far away from this one.Not recommended."
1,RIP OFF!!!,"I should have read the other reviews first, absolutely no way are these the real artists. It should be stated as such in the description, this is deceptive and very bad on Amazon's part."
5,Doxies love this,"My dachshunds are aggressive chewers and this is a great chew product for them. They cannot destroy this easily and keep on chewing it until barely a stub.If you are looking for a product for your dog, I highly recommend this."
3,Didn't last long with my crazy dog,"I see that others liked these chews, so I guess my little dog is a freak. She chewed most of the nubs off the first bone in less than 30 minutes. I love Nylabone products & am used to them being as indestructible as they claim. My 100 lb lab could never destroy anything made by Nylabone, but this itty bitty terrier can demolish almost anything. Back to the drawing board."
3,One minor problem,"I already had one double bar when I made this purchase for 2 more for the other shelves in the fridge and freezer. It does what its suppose to but it also interfered with the door shelves when you close the fridge door. We thought at first that they were falling off and figured this out after a couple of time opening the door and everything falling out. Second is that depending on the fridge using more than one double bar has a tendency to spread the walls of my Norold fridge to the point that my shelves fallout of the slots that the shelves rest in,,,,big problem,,,big mess. Wish I could use a elastic cord (pull in, not push out) but I dont think I want to drill the sides for attaching points. I'm thinking of calling the manufacturer to see if this is possible. For now,,,I would buy these as they do serve a purpose."
2,Very short-lived,"I bought four of these tarps in a slightly longer version and only got one winter out of them before they began deteriorating and leaking. At my location in Connecticut they don't receive alot of sun, but I was disappointed when I found this winter (their second) that the bulk of my firewood was wet and damp. Upon inspection the tarps just seemed to be worn through and weak in places. I mistakenly presumed that with their size and style they were designed for woodpiles and a longer life span, but now I'm looking for more serious tarps to keep my wood dry."
4,Disappointed,"Very good story line. But the swearing in the book detracted from the enjoyment of the story line, and was totally unnecessary."
3,Felt like it was written in the 70's,"I once read a book about 15 years ago that was written in this 70's style of writing about ""famous stars"".It was long winded and difficult to read at times.But I can't not recommend it, as it was not too bad."
2,Needed a better main character,"I really wanted to like this story, really. As a 40 year old woman I wanted to feel for the main character and feel there was some sense of morality in the story. But I was disappointed I'm afraid. In fact, I actually disliked just about every character in this book apart from Ruth.They were all so whiney, weak and hypocritical. The main character Natalie being one of the worst offenders. All in all, I just couldn't like these people.Add to that the amount of sections I found boring and tedious, that I had to skim through, and I guess I wish the book had been about 100 pages shorter. I suggest cutting down some of the length and making the main character more likeable. Then the story might just appeal."
2,Dissatisfying,I realize this was the author's first novel and perhaps future novels will be better researched and written. I gave it two stars for the effort. I found it to be contrived and trite in much of it's phrasing and an unsatisfying ending. You never were made to care about the characters which is a must for any good novel and inconsistent in the way the characters were portrayed. At this point I would be very reluctant to read another novel by this author.
2,Disappointing,I did not enjoy this book and gave up on it after reading 20%. The characters in this book are badly drawn steorotypes and the dialogue is woodden.
2,Teenage Drama,"I'm not much for teenage drama, but it was free so I read it.I can see the teenage population reading this and most likely enjoying it."
4,More than fluff!,This was a great long read. I liked all the characters and their development. There were plenty of surprises and the things I saw coming were nicely done too. What a great book to take to the beach or spend a rainy day with.
4,"Good novel, particularly since it's free","This was a good first novel by a new author, even for someone who usually reads only paranormal fiction. The voice was there, the romance part well developed. I do agree with the others that the editing should've been a bit better (I found a few typos and some poor formatting) but all in all, I'm thankful that it was free even though the writer must have put quite a bit of time into writing this. I would read more by this author."
2,I couldn't like her,"What a whiner. Your husband leaves you for another woman, and after you find him trying to get into your house you go ahead and let him in, sleep with him with no apology for the affair necessary, and then are surprised to wake up alone and oh, maybe some important documents are missing from your safe. Then of course you run into the ex and his girlfriend at dinner and have to leave from all the anger you're feeling. Everything is so awful, why am I reading this? Oh, that's right. I'm not. There are too many good books in the world to waste my time on this one!"
1,glad it was free,"Although the story was decent, the book needed serious proof reading and the story went on and on. I stopped reading this book half way through to read another book and only finished the book because it was still on my kindle. I am very disappointed considering the rating for this book was so high. Again I am glad I didn't pay for it."
1,Fallinng Star,"Can't get into the story, and have put it down after 3 chapters, Hope to pick it up again and finish it. It just has to get better."
4,Good book,"This is the first book I have read by this author and must admit I was pleasantly surprised. It has a great story line, is well written and had an interesting end. It is worth the read"
5,Loved it!,"This was definitely a beach read or maybe just a curl up under a blanket near the fire read. It was sweet, funny & real. Loved the friendships and the dynamics between all the characters."
4,Cute & sassy read!,I got this book because it was free and figured I'd at least give it a shot. It was much better than I expected and I finished it in in a few days. Great summer fun read! Had some great twists to keep you interested and wasn't overly sappy or girly. Highly suggest!!
5,A fun read with lots of heart and lots of behind-the-scenes info about the news business,I really enjoyed this book. The main character was someone I could really relate to and the plot moved very well. I also enjoyed learning about the television news business and it was obvious the writer was well-involved with it. Highly recommended.
3,Fun fast read,"Good fun read, Some of the spelling errors were slightly annoying, and it was a predictable plot but I still enjoyed it; kept me good company on an otherwise boring flight."
4,"""Falling Star"" Also Rises","I enjoyed ""Falling Star"" though I agree with other reviewers that it could have benefited from more attentive editing. The story line is well paced and, toward the end, the book is hard to put down. I thought that the two prominent ""evil"" characters were a bit overdrawn, especially Kelly. Still, Dempsey offers a compelling dramatization of the moral and ethical struggles in a high-profile newsroom (e.g., individual vs. team; greed vs. sacrifice) and even manages to weave in a romantic love story.Ken"
4,Fun and easy but stereo types abound,"I'm at the point where I read for entertainment. This book was entertaining. It was free on Kindle and gave me two nights of escape to the world of TV news LA style. I didn't necessarily like the characterization of an extremely successful 40 year old woman who is so depressed about her age and insecure about life. Then again, all the characters were stereotypes. Still, it was fast-paced enough not to dwell on the lack of original characters. And in the end, I read it all quickly and liked it."
5,Great read!,I actually only downloaded this book because it was free but it is by far the best book I've read this summer. It's chick-lit but the characters and stories are much more developed than in a typical chick-lit novel. Great story line and I plan on reading this author's other books now. It's a great summer vacation book :)
5,"I would compare it to Devil in the Junior League - both fast, fun reads.","I really enjoyed Falling Star. I found it to be an entertaining read, and the Kelly character was right on target for those of us who have found ourselves competing nose-to-nose with that type of human. (I would say it brought back memories but I believe I have managed to permanently suppress them!)Really fun read! I totally recommend it, and just purchased another novel from Diana Dempsey."
4,Great Read,A quick and entertaining read - I loved the quirky characters and the fun plot. I highly recommend this author. A+
4,Great for Holidays,"This book is great to take on a holiday, relationship dramas, fun and insight into the journalism industry. Easy read and enjoyable."
4,"A good, entertaining book",This book was fun to read and had an interesting twist to it. I liked the descriptions especially in terms of the location where the book takes place. Overall an easy read - I would recommend it.
4,Falling Star,"I thought the book was very intertaining, but not blood and gut and gore. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I recommend it to those of you who like J. D. Robb or Janet Evanovich."
4,Falling Star,"I got this book because it was free, I was surprised that it was so well written. It was a good story, little predictable but a good read. I really enjoyed it."
2,Poorly edited,"I'm surprised by all the glowing reviews of this book. I wasn't really rooting for Natalie so much as I was rooting against Kelly, Tony, and Miles. All in all, the plot was interesting and kept me reading. However, it became tedious to read through all the filler material that was irrelevant to the plot. The biggest hurdle for me was the extremely poor editing. I read this on my Kindle, so the editing may have been better in print form. However, names were spelled differently throughout the book (Maxine/Marine), and the wrong words were used throughout. The book is in definite need of a proofread. The plot is the only thing that kept me trudging through."
4,It Kept me on the edge of my Seat!!,"I actually loved the novel. It was a long read but I just felt I had to keep on reading to find out whats going to happen next which made it exciting! The only issue about this book is that there were some typos that needed to be reviewed and corrected. Other than that, I enjoyed it!"
3,Depressing but kept me interested,"The first 2/3 of this book is utterly depressing. I understand people have rough patches in live but the main character, Natalie, had a ridiculous amount of opposition. The ending was good but I think the story should have been shortened. It was just too much drama."
3,"Not great, not terrible.","I downloaded this as a free ebook for my iPad and I am glad I didn't pay for it. Mildly interesting and fairly well-written, but overly drawn out at times, and I couldn't find much to like about the protagonist. The character development was weak - not much depth to any of them. The plot line was okay, but very predictable for the most part. I can't really recommend spending the time to read this, even if it is free."
3,needs a good clean up,"The premise of this story was fair and the writing wasn't too bad, but I quit reading half-way through because I was getting so bogged down in the excessive similes and news jargon. If the author can clean up her writing and stay away from the jargon, she could be a really good read."
2,Just okay,"Seeing so many positive reviews, I was pretty disappointed by the book. Like someone else mentioned, I plodded on just to find out what happened to the antagonists, not necessarily because the main character was compelling. I can understand why a few readers were unable to get through the story though. I also skimmed toward the middle through to the end."
4,"Good book, but the misspellings were awful!!","I really enjoyed this book, but I cannot complain enough about the horrendous editing that was (not) done. There were so many misplaced and misspelled words that it really detracted from the enjoyment of the read. Please edit, re-edit, and edit again before you release your work."
2,plot drags,"The book starts off okay. However, it bogs down early into the book. I felt like the writer was getting paid by the word.I read about 20% into the novel, stopped and skipped to about 95% into the novel. I didn't have a bit of a problem picking up the plot. Plus, all those things one knows will happen from the beginning of the book do happen.Any book that I can flip to the end, not be lost, and find completely predictable is not a book I can recommend.If the verbage had been reduced to novella length, it would have been much better.I also never cared about the heroine. One isn't expected to like the heroine in every book, but I'm pretty sure the reader was supposed to like this one."
4,Fast read but predictable,"I downloaded Falling Star because it was a free book and sounded interesting. Overall I enjoyed the book but found that it was very predictable. I agree with the other post that I wasn't necessarily rooting for Natalie as I was rooting against all the ""villians"" of the book. I wanted Kelly to get what was coming to her, and for Tony to be seen as the scumbag he is.I didn't feel like any of the characters really learned their lessons and accepted their mistakes. Even Natalie didn't show any real remorse for her poor decisions. In the end, everyone got what was coming to them but they never really evolved as characters."
1,Not worth my time reading,OMG - why would I care about these characters? It is so uninteresting that I stopped at 16% of the book. I kept thinking that it would get better and it did not. Not sure why others gave this book such high ratings. I am deleting it from my Kindle today.
2,Disappointed,"I found the story interesting and it kept me reading, but the number of typos really distracted me. Sometimes, on every page! I read this on Kindle....don't know if something happened in the transfer from paper to Kindle,, but it was bad. Even completely wrong words sometimes....as if an auto correct or spell check took over.Curious, do they really still use VHS tapes in the TV news world? Sounded outdated to me, but maybe that is the way it's still done."
2,why is this book so popular?,"The story was interesting in the beginning but, kept getting duller and duller. It was hard to connect to such trite, dull characters . Two women fighting for position with their talons out. One a young woman who would do anything to succeed. She was a bimbo and just nasty. The other just dull"
3,Falling Star,Good light read for beach or bedtime. An all's well that ends well type of book. Definitely a woman's book better than the steamy romance genre.
3,fair,Characters were not too loveable so it was not a must read. I finished it to see the expected outcome.
3,Mixed Feelings,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the plot of this book, I have several negative feelings. I liked Natalie and appreciate the struggles of an older woman in a career where youth and beauty means a lot. But, there's so much boring, unimportant filler that you have to trudge through to get to the good parts. It seems like, in the middle of a conversation, there appears a big descriptive few paragraphs or inner monologue you have to get through to finish the conversation. It really was hard to get through this book.And the ending! Ugh. I felt like half the plot was left unresolved. It definitely needed more. Less filler in the rest of the book and more at the end."
2,predictable,"this book was predictable,and took too long to get to a point, usually i like long books but this one was not really worth the time as it did not keep me interested"
2,Kindle Book falling star,"I got this book to read to go on hoilday with aswell as a lot more books unfortunly my kindle did not work aboroad and the screen just had something down the middle of it i have it in my case and its well look after its 18th months old and i was told that i would have to pay 50 for a new one i was very upset as this was a present off my husband and i had lots of books on it and one that a friend has written and its only on the kindle Georges world, also i am a christian and was left with a bible to read i was very diapointed as i had oredered a 4-5 books also as i love reading Please can anyone eles let me know why it doesnt work aborad or if they have had problems i have been using Amzon for a long time now and i am so disapointed their is nothing to say that you cant use it abroadvery sadcustomer denise"
2,Falling Star,"I liked the story, but was very put off by the foul language throughout the book. Most things can be expressed without potty language!"
1,couldn't finish,"This was a boring read!!! I got tired of her drifting from one thing to the next. It just made me want to slap that lady and kick the shows producer in the jewels!!! I don't like to read stories where the lead character has no spine and keeps letting people use them. I hate to not finish a book, but I must say that I didn't finish this one."
1,DL @ your own Peril!,I hated this book. It just kept dragging on. And even though I never hate a book I found myself wanting to rip the ebook from my computer and burn it. But since that was impossible I endured just so I could honestly tell you this: free or not its definitely mind numbing reading and download at your own peril.
1,yawn,Another author who thinks sexual description is worth more than a good story line and that the lives of entertainment personalities are more interesting than other peoples.
1,Terrible,Rarely have I come across a book that I can't finish. This is one of them. It is just bad. I truly hate when the female lead is supposed to be an intelligent woman and the is just ridiculously stupid.
2,"Good plot idea, poor story","I keep trying and trying to get into this book and just can't. The plot idea is good, but I can't stand the characters. The heroine/underdog Natalie, comes off more as weary and run-down. Kelly is less of a love-to-hate but instead just immature, obnoxious and annoying. There is not a good connection/explanation of back story to Evie. I dislike Geoff and can't see what Natalie would even like about the guy. Anyway, I keep picking the book back up in hopes it will get better, but I'm at chapter 11 and still can't get into it."
4,Entertaining Book,"The book was alittle wordy, but overall very entertaining. Good book I enjoyed reading it. Sometimes you just need light reading material."
5,Great Book,"This is probably on the the best of the 66 books I have read since I bought my Kindle. I have read Peterson, Grisham, and Graham. Good books but this had the same quality and it was at considerable less cost. The ending is much better than most endings, it takes a few chapters to unravel. I do not want to discose the ending. Well worth the price. I will be buying more of her low cost books and save the gas to the library and that of the more popular authors."
3,NICE EFFORT,"Diana Dempsey gives us FALLING STAR, about Ms. Dempsey's field, television news. Is it that cut throat and all the on air smiles just cover the jealousy? It was ok, an ok read. Wanted to know more from the characters and wonder how much the simply falling in bed happens. Didn't really feel for them. Really a nice read for free, might try another of her books."
4,Good Beach Read,"I have to say that I ordered this book for my Kindle because of a free promotion and I was very pleasantly surprised. Just the right length, for a good beach read, and sufficiently interesting. The characters were well developed and the plot interesting. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. I will definitely keep this author on my to read list."
4,Good read,"What a disaster of a career end. That's all I could think about in sympathy. The author definitely wrote fiction and most of the characters were cookie cutter. Bad boss, gorgeous attorney, younger rival, soon to be ex. It was a bit too cloches."
3,Summer reading,"I enjoyed this book for it's summer reading appeal. The story concerns a broken-hearted professional woman, out to save her career and survive a failing marriage. I like stories with worthy heroes, and this is one."
5,A good read.,"I cannot believe that this was a free book on Kindle. The story line and characters were totally realistic. The only nit I have to pick is that Jack Daniels is not, never has been, never will be SCOTCH."
4,Easy read,"An easy read, characters were relatable for sure. In all aspects of life this is something that is happening all the time. Well qualified women being cast aside due to their age... Enjoyable but somewhat predictable."
4,Falling Star by Diana Dempsey,"In an age where youth seems to mean everything, I really enjoyed this book since it clearly brought forward the idea that experience, maturity and guts still count for a lot in getting ahead in this world. As a senior citizen I feel I have a great deal to offer the younger generation and in this work that was only reinformed."
3,Ok book but would make a great TV mini series,"An ok book with filled with lots of drama of a television news network and it's star anchor, Natalie Daniels. A new director has been hired to get ratings up and drastically cut costs. His target to fix both? Replace seasoned news anchor, Natalie Daniels, with the young hot Kelly Devlin. Oh and cut Natalie's salary by 80%. Just how far will these women go to hold their place in the spotlight?The book has plenty of plot turns and drama and would be a better TV series than it held as a book. It seemed to drag on a bit. But still, for a quick no-brainer, drama-seeking guilty pleasure, it was still an interesting read."
3,Strange western,"Odd little western (originally filmed in 3D) directed by Roy Rowland seems split into two parts which seem to have little to do with each other. In the first half, a lynch mob breaks down the jail to hang a cattle rustler (Fred MacMurray), who rustles by moonlight hence the title, but they hang the wrong man! MacMurray takes it upon himself to avenge the innocent man. There's a bizarre flashback that seems totally out of place as if someone decided the film needed a comic respite. The second half focuses on the two brothers (MacMurray, William Ching) both in love with the same woman (Barbara Stanwyck) and the bank robbery that proves disastrous to all involved, only this time it's Stanwyck who takes it upon herself to get revenge. Considering it was filmed in 3D, there's very little (outside of a brawl with fists and chairs flying) ""in your face"" 3D effects.The Warners Archives DVD is a crisp B&W; transfer in the appropriate 1.33 ratio."
2,Not recommended,"Meets the need for a light if you really have to put a light on your fan. Our problem is that our Emerson fan is a high end model. While the finish matched well, the fitter detracted seriously from the unit's appearance. Installed it and immediately took it off and sent it back."
4,Decent Overview W/Price List,Very general overview - with a good pricelist. Covers all vette models - good info on colors and engine codes.
2,Not a very satisfying purchase,"The book is mostly very bland facts and figures. The intro to each model year is very brief and then goes straight into VINs and paint codes. I also don't like how the options and prices are written in paragraph form instead of as a list. That makes it difficult to compare between model years.However, my biggest complaint are the book's ""quality control"" errors. There are a few spelling errors and there are no less than 10 pictures that are mislabled (example: a magnetic red convertible labled as an electron blue Z06). The price guide section also inexplicably contains the header: ""The prices listed here represent a sample of British sports cars imported to North America, taken from the 2004 Old Cars Price Guide. If you do not see your car here , check the 2005 edition of Cars and Prices or contact the club of your British car.""There are a lot of great pictures in this book, which is its saving grace."
5,"Crazy in love, Big Easy style!","Anne Stuart is amazing! She can take characters and make you love them so much that you never want the story to end. This is one of those stories. And this book is filled with characters who you wish you never had to say goodbye to. Peter is crazy (in love), smart, sexy and witty. Margaret is attracted to Peter despite his reputation for being a 'lady killer'. A fierce tigress trying to keep her wits about her, her daughter safe and herself sane in a house full of nutty relatives, she is a character you can wholeheartedly root for. The Mardi Gras scenes are enough to make you wish you were there. This remains my favorite of Anne Stuart's many wonderful stories, for the humor, the mystery and most especially for the romance between Peter and his Marguerite! A definite keeper!"
4,A Modern-Day Gothic -- and a Good One,"This books has it all. Southern atmosphere, a dysfunctional family, lots of secrets... Oh, yeah, and a hero suspected of being an insane killer. Now is that Gothic or what?One thing that makes this stand apart from many of the old Gothics is that the heroine is strong. She has to be to put up with this family. Also, there are sensual love scenes.My only regret was that this wasn't one of Anne Stuart's longer romances. The mystery would have been even stronger then.I gave this a B+ review at All About Romance."
5,A true modern gothic by the very best in romance authors,"This is a very unusual read. It's like taking a trip to the "" big easy"" with a very entertaining family! Peter, (the crazy one) is under house arrest, when Margaret comes to stay. She, and her daughter might be the cure that Peter needs. The mystery, sexual tension, and the fun of Mardi Gras add to the spice of this great book. It truly is a keeper!"
5,"A Murder, Mystery, Mardi Gras and a Masquerade.","Peter Jaffrey is a hunk. But, he's also a killer; isn't he? Margaret is destitute, and worried about her daughter; before, she is even willing to meet her dead husband's family. One day in the home of this family, and you understand that Margaret might be better off worried about destitution! Add to the mystery, a masquerade, Mardi Gras, a family mansion, weird relatives; you really have a marvelous old-time gothic."
3,Dark Assassin,"Anne Perry is always a fun read, but this mystery took as many plot turns as the underground sewer project with which it dealt.JGR"
2,Awful,"My taste runs to P.D. James and Martha Grimes. I picked this up hoping to find a new series. It reads like a Harlequin romance with a body in it. Everything aches - eyes ache, voices ache, the gaslights ache. Hardened policemen speak in voices husky with emotion. And everyone but the villain is so blindingly good hearted as to be disgusting. Throughout the story the author keeps building up to a horrible impending disaster - something so much worse and more terrifying than a cave-in. The disaster turns out, surprisingly enough, to be a cave-in. Absolutely tedious."
3,Not great if it's your first Anne Perry book.,"Maybe this was not the best book from Anne Perry. It seemed a bit repetitive. Most of the time, I have a hard time putting a book down but with this one, I had to make an effort to keep picking up where I left off to try to finish. I was easily hooked with Carola Dunn, Rhys Bowen and M. C. Beaton."
4,Good spotlight on Victorian life along and below the Thames,I love learning about new facets of the Victorian era that haven't gotten much coverage in literature. And as with every Perry book in the Monk series you get a taste of all walks of life.
3,"good item, perfect for the palm pilot, but....","I like the product, it certainly goood for the palm pilot III BUT, I'm very disapointed that it didn't come with USB. This is bad because laptops no longer have as many ports as they used to, and making additional investments for such a device gets expensive after a while.Though as described it is compact, folds, and this makes it a good device... if only it had a usb attachment to it, included...."
1,Don't bother,"Although the author is an obvious Goldie fan, there is no really specific, detailed information about them in this book.Save your money."
3,Truly for Dummies,"I don't know what I was thinking ordering this book online. I recently purchased a golden puppy and I was hoping to learn more about the breed and training. It has a lot of useful information for people who are deciding whether or not to buy a golden. However, I already purchaced my baby and the book what not all that helpful. It seems like the book can erase and insert any other breed name into it. Very general puppy training info. I was able to read the book in 2 days. I was expecting more from a women who has owned goldens herself for many years. This just reaffirmed my reasons for not buying online. You really have no idea what you are getting. I won't do it again.Good Luck to others with Goldens. They are the best breed ever."
5,Strongly Recommended by the GoldenRetrieverInstitute.com,"I am a Director of the Golden Retriever Institute (&#060;a href = ""http://www.GoldenRetrieverInstitute.com"">http://www.GoldenRetrieverInstitute.com&#060;/a>) - one of the world's leading organizations engaged in research into the welfare and training of Golden Retrievers.I can tell you from my experience that this book should be required reading for anyone who is thinking of purchasing a Golden Retriever or already has one.The book does an excellent job of covering the basics of taking care of, maintaining and training Golden Retrievers.The sections on taking care of your Golden Retriever's health and ensuring that it has a long and healthy life are some of the best I have ever seen in books of this genre.And the Part of Tens will give you dozens of ideas regarding fun things you can do with your dog.Strongly recommended."
4,golden retrievers for Dummies,This book is packed with useful information about the Golden Retriever and is written in an easy to follow format. In a clear and easy to follow way the the author explains and provides useful information on how to take care of your pet and what to do and not to do. I recommend this book which has helped me a lot.
4,Freud is Fascinating--In a Historical Artifact-Like Way,"Although many of his ideas have now been refuted and/or are seen as far-fetched, it is worth taking a look at if one is interested in reading first-hand what Freud has to say.Very intellectual material. Definitely not a bedtime read."
2,Civilized Discourse Leaves Discontented Reader,"There isn't much I can add to previous reviews of Civilziation and Its Discontents. My own reaction (after 2 cracks at it, one in college, and one post-) is one of bafflement and boredom. With academic, convoluted language, Freud discusses the role of the individual with his neuroses and his conflicts with socialization and civilization. Many of his jumbled sociological observations are better recorded by previous thinkers--Rousseau, for example. His psychological conclusions have more or less been explored at length in his previous works. Therefore, the redeeming value is found, perhaps, in Freud's closing passages, eery portends of Europe's ugly years."
1,am i crazy? or dumb?,"I am reading this book for a THIRD time. It's a required book for an introductory composition class I'm taking. The fact that my teacher asks his students to read this book AT LEAST three times should have been a clear warning sign. It is the most round-about, long-winded and dense book or writing I have ever come across. I'm shocked that it's such a popular book, a landmark they say. Although Freud does have many interesting ideas, they could be stated MUCH more simply. What a HEADACHE!Nevertheless, those who enjoy convoluted, intricate and time-intensive reading are likely to seriously appreciate this book. HOWEVER, for those who prefer simple sentences and straightforward writing, like myself, this is NOT the book for you."
3,Makes you think...,"Along with a bunch of series of books about suffering, and misery, and pain... I had to read Civilization and Its Discontents. Basically Mr. Freud rants on, and on, and on, about topics. To get into it is quite hard, but once you understand his way of writing, you become more comfortable with his never-ending sentences. He says that in exchanged for living in civilization, we trade in happiness for guilt. And it is true."
1,Terrible,"Fans who believe that John Fogerty forced Doug Clifford and Stu Cook to contribute two thirds of this album to prove a point may not be listening carefully. John's contributions to Mardi Gras are also pretty weak. It's just possible that he was desperately seeking some breathing room under the weight of an onerous recording contract.Consider this...only 3 Fogerty songs on Mardi Gras are original. The fourth, Hello Mary Lou, is a Ricky Nelson song. Fogerty's next album (The Blue Ridge Rangers) did not contain a single original song. And his first solo album (John Fogerty) relied on a few covers as well.He didn't record again for 10 years after ""John Fogerty"". Maybe the great man was simply tapped out.No matter...he deserved a rest. Six brilliant albums in a row, all resting solely on his shoulders, are more than most artists can claim."
3,I USED TO HAVE THE ALBUM COVER ON MY WALL......,"Its a pretty cool album cover, no? I like it.The album, however faulters.Its not bad, its just that... ok, CCR released six albums in like two years I think.All these guys ever did was fight with each other, and six albums not one was bad. I mean, every one was pretty much solid all the way through. Every one had at least three hit singles. At least.This here, number seven for the band only had one hit single SWEET HITCH HIKER.The rest isn't very memorable.John Fogerty let the other guys have some creative input. I think just to let them know that HE WAS the band. (To further prove this point he would quit for good about a month later.)The album cover is pretty damned cool though."
1,You don't replace John Lennon from The Beatles with Larry the Cable Guy!,"UGH!!! To say that this album stinks would be an insult to bad smells everywhere! This album proves once and for all that John Fogerty was the REAL talent behind the band! The majority of the songs on this album all sound like a group of drunken losers at closing time trying to sing a tune they heard from the jukebox! Learn from MY mistake! Just download the song ""Sweet Hitch-Hiker""; it's old school CCR!"
2,"Someday never came, and we still don't understand","Creedence Clearwater Revival/ Mardi Gras: ""Sweet Hitch-Hiker"" is the last great CCR song and it can be found on this album, but for some reason they decided not to BE Creedence Clearwater Revival when they did the rest of the songs on this album. Whatever they were attempting to do, we didn't understand it, and we wish they hadn't done it. Sadly, this, their last album, is a two-star release."
1,Definitively worse and the final Creedence album!,"I'd thought this cd was any good but i was wrong it's not. I think that CCR should be a shamed of their record company industry for putting them in charge of lots a hard work like Stu Cook, bassist and drummer Doug Clifford don't even sound great except John Fogerty performing only four song tracks are OK included which are ""Lookin' For A Reason"", ""Sweet Hitch-Hiker"", ""Hello Mary Lou"" and ""Someday Never Comes"" are classics here. But those were the days when guitarist Tom Fogerty left and the pressure, tension & strain got to them alreadyit was time for Creedence Clearwater Revival to break-up. And also going into a different direction for three memebers from the band years together. So anyway in my opinion TWO THUMBS WAY DOWN!"
2,I'm sorry...,"...this album just blows. Not enough John, too much of Doug & Stu. Neither one of them can sing. I thought the Grateful Dead's 'Pigpen' was bad..."
3,Not my favorite of CCR,Not my favorite CD ! We love John Fogerty and CCR. Sometimes some of the CDS are not as good as others. Did not affect our 100% satisfaction with Amazon.com
3,Not For The Casual CCR Fan,"If you are a casual fan of CCR, then there are certainly better discs to get (i.e., Green River, Willy and the Poorboys) or any compilation should suffice. However, the John Fogerty contributions to this album are worth the price of this disc. ""Lookin For A Reason"" and ""Hello Mary Lou"" foreshadow the direction Fogerty was to take with The Blue Ridge Rangers. ""Sweet Hitch-Hiker"" rocks with the best of any CCR tune. But the gem here is ""Someday Never Comes"". Fogerty has written a classic song that seems to be forgotten amongst an often maligned effort by the group. Yet the songs contributed by Stu Cook and Doug Clifford are listenable and tuneful. Sure, this was not their best effort, but no Creedence collection is truly complete without this record. If your looking for the ""hits"" look elsewhere. If you are a real fan of this once great American Band then you should complete the journey that began with ""Suzie Q"" to experience the full metamorphosis of CCR."
2,ccr goes out with a whimper,"they don't call this album ""fogertys' revenge"" for nothing. Doug and Stew wanted to write and sing in the worst way, - they did."
4,"A well-written collection of short stories, but.....","This is a collection of short stories, some of which take place in Haiti and some in New York. The Haiti stories are unrelentingly depressing, while the New York stories are uplifting. Danticat's inspiration seems to come from family stories about Haiti and perhaps her family's experience as immigrants to the US. However, I recognized one dream sequence involving a character's father in a helicopter over a cliff as being lifted entirely from the movie ""Paperhouse""."
3,Amy Khan [Mrs. Jones review],"Krik? Krak! was an okay bo0k. When I first got it in class, I thought it would be super boring. After reading it, I've learned about the struggles that women went through not to long ago. I've learned about the cultures/customs/beliefs of the Haitian people. Some parts were confusing though. It switched from story to story and it was difficult to understand who was telling the story. The book wasn't that bad though. It's out of the ordinary from what I usually read. I've also learned to appreciate what I have, because there's people out there that have less than I do but are also greatful..."
4,Beautiful,Touching stories that paint a vivid picture. Every word has a role in these moving stories that depict the lives of strong women in or from Haiti. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to be embraced by culture and to brave the sorrow.
3,Strong images of beloved Haiti,"""Krik Krak"" is an impressionistic look at the lives of Haitians living in their native country and in America. The story's images are the strongest part of the book -- a mother, in denial after the stillbirth of a child, clutches its dead body. A father plummets inexplicably from a hot air balloon. A young bride-to-be, missing an arm, shops for a prosthesis for her wedding day accompanied by her superstitious mother. If the the story had an arc, it was subtle -- perhaps the progression from desperate escapee to semi-established in a new land.Danticat has a lyrical writing style full of wonderful images and a deep love for her characters. A fine book, probably most attractive to those in love with all things Haitian."
4,Krik?Krak!,"This book is composed of short stories presented to us almost in the fashion of a poem. It tells of Hatian people,women in particular, who show outstanding resiliency to spirit bounding rulers and soilders. Women who continued to love after heart-break and kept the memory of one another alive through story-telling and imagination.Each story is a piece of anothers life, put together to combine a life-story that will last for many years to come. The result is a collection that saddens,angers, and enlightens the reader with its poetic beauty."
4,Review for Krik?Krak!,"Krik?Krak! is an amazing book giving insight into the lives of Haitian women. I really enjoyed this book. It's a breathtakingly real eye into the country and it shows the raw grim reality of the women portrayed. The book illustrates a clear imageof the poverty, the lack of education, the sexism, and the turmoil of the lives of Haitian women. It is a very fast read and will instantly become a favorite."
3,"Krik Krak is okay, but...","For the most part, I liked the book. But I felt that the Haiti stories were depressing, and the New York stories too lightweight. I'd like to have seen more of the conflicts between Haitian and American culture. The conflicts seem too bland for me. I think that ""New York Day Women"" is the best story in the collection."
1,"Overhyped, overpraised and overtly sentimental","I first heard about the book when it was nominated for the National Book Award. I expected a short-listed book to be of a high standard at the very least but this book was a total disappointment. The writing is plain, dull and the 'poetry' that many reviewers talk of is lacking. Whilst the subject matter is painful, you feel as if the writing is too contrived and its primary purpose is to aim a few darts at the heart. This kind of sentimental and melodramatic writing is hardly the material of great or good literature. It reads like the 'tragic' tales section of certain tabloids."
3,Jemima Skerrit ( Harry S. Truman HS) Ms. Jones 6th pd.,"The book Krik? Krak? was written by Edwidge Danticat. When I fist started to read this book I thought it was boring but after reading a couple more chapters in the book I came to realize how good the book is. I believe that this book can relate to everyone around the world. This book also revolves around the struggles, death and pain that people with differet cultures go through every day of their life."
3,"Good Writer, Bittersweet Book","OK, This book was assigned for me to read for my summer honors english reading. I hated the book. Edwige is a good writer, and she used excellent description in her stories, but if the reader is male, the book is horrible. The book is about generations of Haitian women in her family, and it has no appeal for a male. To me some of the stories were pointless and boring."
4,Gives insight into Haitian culture that only fiction can.,"This is an amazing collection of short stories that read like poetry, and remind one of Haitian paintings. They play on the emotion, and capture a sense of what it must feel like to be a Haitian. The short stories are poetry to those who like poetry, they are anthropology for those who seek a better understanding of the culture, and they a feminist literature for those who would define it as such.While some might find them ""overdone"", I find them magnificent, like Haitian art."
4,Intelligent reading contradictory of the Common Perception,"Krik Krak was assigned to us for my first year english class in college. I was not anxious to read it however; after reading it I began to feel connected with the author. Even though none of these storeis are true to life, the ideas that they are based on are amazing. How anyone could survive under the circumstances is incredible. When people think of Haiti most of them would say that there were colorful costumes and all the inhabitants are delightful. Krik Krak depicts Haiti as a dark militarized place in which the unspeakable happens. This book had changed my life. Now I know what I have based on what others are lacking and it showed me so much of what I take for granted."
4,A True Reflection of Life in Haiti,"This is a great book with deep insight into the travails of the Haitian people. It would help the reader to do a little research on what place Krick? Krack! holds in the oral tradition of Haiti. Also, it would be helpful for the reader to look into what lodyans are. Enjoy this great book."
4,Perfect!,"This book is a perfect acculmulation of different, but interconnecting stories that reveal important, but too often unexamined, parts of Haitian life and culture. A must-read of all proud people of Haitian descent!"
3,Jemima Skerrit ( Harry S. Truman HS) Ms. Jones 6th pd.,"The book Krik?Krak? was written by Edwidge Danticat. I believe that this book is a very good book, although I thought it was boring when I first stared reading it. I also think that this book revolves around the struggles, death, and pain that people of different cultures go through, throughout their life. It shows how not everyone in this world does not go though life the way they expect and you have to go through alot in order to succeed."
5,Krik? Krack,"This book remind me so much of Haiti, I am so proud of Edwidge Danticat. She did a wonderful job writing this book, I would ask everyone to read this book. I am looking forward to Edwidge other books and I am proud of her accomplishments."
4,prince syn gut 16 dura,"This is the string that my club strung my racket with during high school tennis. The durability of this string is horrible. It breaks after less than 4 hours of play. It does feel soft, so I often use it as a cost-effective cross string when stringing with more expensive poly mains."
5,Absolutely the best thing we've ever watched on t.v.,"We watched the original mini-series and we were literally ""glued"" to the t.v.; it's an understatement to say that this mini-series is incredibly compelling. The storyline, the acting and simply everything about it is SUPERB!"
5,Now ... with captioning !,"I own (and love) the original DVD of Traffik. But, sometimes you could not hear exactly what some of the actors were saying, due to mumbling (?) or just bad audio.This new version has captioning (in addition to being ""remastered""), so ... you will not miss a thing.P.S. And ... yes -- the ""Hollywood"" / Michael Douglas / Traffic is embarrassingly bad."
4,Dubbed in English??,"I loved Traffik when I saw it on Masterpiece Theater and I knew I wanted it for my permanent collection. Predicably, it's the same program (actually with a few minutes extra), with the high-quality picture and sound of a DVD.I was a bit disappointed, however, that the entire first episode was dubbed in English, with no optional audio channel with the original dialogue. On TV the two German narcotics cops spoke German with English subtitles. It was more real, and that was the version I was accustomed to. The latter episodes on the DVD were OK (They spoke German with subtitles)."
2,Same Poor Quality as Before,"This review is only on the 20th Anniversary Edition. Traffik remains a 5-star drama in my mind, one of the best miniseries ever produced. But the 20th Anniversary Edition is the same (poor) video quality as the 2001. I don't know what they ""remastered"" for it looks exactly the same as the one I bought in 2001. Subtitles are still hard-coded and spotty. They do not appear for conversations that are peripheral to the main dialog. The original version at least had these dubbed. It was not my preferance, but it was better than no translation at all.If you already have the 2001 version, don't bother with the ""new"" one. It's just an attempt to sell the same old video."
1,DVD is unwatchable,"I'm strongly in the minority here, and I desperately wanted to share in the celebration of this series, but, as one or two other reviewers have noted here, the horrendous quality of the transfer and the almost comically bad dubbing stopped me from getting through the first hour.The opening sequences in Germany had me checking to see if I had the right DVD in the player. I felt like I was watching a C-grade German action flick from the '70s (if there ever was such thing!). Follow that up with Pakistani farmers speaking in borderline Apu Nahasapemapetalan (the Kwikee Mart owner from The Simpsons) -esque accents and I just couldn't take it.I'm holding out hope that one day they issue a DVD of the ""original"" version that another reviewer mentioned, where the dialogue is subtitled as it should be.As I said, most people won't care a lick about this kind of thing, but if dubbing and poor print quality bug you, stay away!"
3,Poor picture quality,"This is a great mini series, even if you already have seen the movie, but I was very disappointed about the picture quality. It is very poor. I have not read complaints about this from other reviewers so far, so I wonder if it's my copy or what?"
3,Region 1 release = 3 stars. Region 2 release = 5 stars.,"Nothing much to add, apart from saying that the region 2 release has been superbly produced, so if you want to avoid the poor US market adaptation and have a multi region player, purchase the region 2 version from Amazon UK.It was really dumb to change the original subtitling to dubbing.If you can take it raw, watch Traffik. If you can't, watch the movie."
4,A world apart...,"Do yourself a favor and watch this well made, interesting film which shows how life is in a place you'll most likely never see!Tuya's life is made harder after her husband injures his back and can no longer work on their sheep farm. She is forced to realize that she needs an able bodied husband and should get divorced and try to marry again. She is responsible for the well being of her two children and she works 24-7, dressed in layers against the cold of the steppes, riding her camel and coming home to make food and more hot milk-tea, everyone's favorite drink OTHER than booze.The plot doesn't thicken much more, but its enough for a good glimpse into a world infinitely different from ours. Well directed and well filmed, colorful and COLD!"
2,Snap!,"Same experience as the others. Worked great. Went to put on after not that much use and snap, the headband broke into two pieces. Now to figure out how to contact the company to see if they will replace."
1,Mine Split In Half Also,I have to concur with the other review. These ear muffs were great until they split in half. Went to put them on after 6 months of light use and crack!
2,great earmuffs split in half,Excellent head phones until they split in half. I bought two pair not knowing. I can't believe they're still on the shelves.MSA did replace them with no problem and sent a better model that works great.
1,They will break,"Like the other reviewers, I found these ear muffs failed after a few months of light use. The headpiece broke in half. I got replacements twice but finally just threw out the last pair when they broke. There is no way you can use this product without it failing no matter how gently you put the ear muffs on your head. For the best ear muffs search for Bilsom Thunder T3. They are so good I bought two one for me, one for my wife."
1,Consistently Lousy,Same deal as all the other reviewers: These things split in half if you even look at them the wrong way. I have snapped two pairs even while treating them as gingerly as possible. Buy something else!!
2,Worked great for hearing protection until it split in half.,"I've had these ear muffs for awhile. They are comfortable and great at blocking out noise. I use them for around the house chores, such as vacuuming.I just went to use them and the headband had split in half. Arrgh! So annoying!Before they split in half, they were great. Easily worthy of four stars, and maybe even five.(Update: The company was nice enough to send out a replacement pair without much hassle. It's a different model. So I can recommend this company, just not this model.)"
1,Great until broke in half,This was a good ear muff for playing drums until it snapped into two pieces. I had used it very few times and always with care but it was disappointing to see how easy it broke.I wouldn't buy this again unless they come up with better headband support.
1,Don't waste your money,"After getting a free replacement pair of these ear muffs having the first pair split in half I was smart enough to get a Peltor back up pair. Sure enough after maybe using the new pair once a month for about six months they also split in half. Luckily I had a back up pair or I would have been unable to do the work I wanted to do that day. Oh, they are inexpensive and they'll work fine at the beginning but one day when you really need them they will split in half and you will be wondering why you ever purchased them."
2,"Comfortable, But Only Lasted About a Year","I had these earmuffs for about a year. Probably about six months in, one of the earcups fell off, but it could be put back on. Then about six months later, the headband snapped right in the middle, making them useless after about a year, give or take. The headband is made of plastic, so it's really not all that surprising they broke. Although, the packaging says they were made in Taiwan. I'm accustomed to high manufacturing standards for things from Taiwan, but it goes to show you, cheap goods can be made anywhere. I will only get earmuffs with a metal band now.On the plus side, they were pretty comfortable and fold up for easy storage; noise reduction was decent. Spend a little more for something better though."
2,Not impresses with book,This book was too general to be of much use. I did not find the book of much use on my visit to Quebec.
4,A Man Ahead of His Time,"The descriptions and pictures of the English manor house set in Africa were interesting, but what I found fascinating was the complex character of Stewart Gore-Browne. He clearly loved the beauty of the land of Africa and its people, yet he was continually frustrated and angered by both. He treated his workers extremely well, loaned them money, helped with education, yet he also beat them.Gore-Browne was ahead of his time in understanding that the white man should and could not be the rulers of Africa, that the governments should be run by the native people. He spent much of his life trying to achieve that goal. As others have said, it is a wonder that his name is not well known. Christina Lamb shone light on a story that should be told."
4,Great product but still a little short.,The actual case is great but the clip is very flimsy. I've already broken the clip on one and the other that I ordered is well on its way to the grave yard just from standard use. Case is Great clip is bad. You can get extra clips at the mall though so its not so bad considering the price.
3,G.H. Mair's English Literature: Modern,"This has some enjoyable reading collected together for Kindle, and the table of contents will reveal specific works that Kindle readers can enjoy."
1,NOT THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION,The name of this album is misleading. I barely knew most of the songs on this album and I have three albums of this artist at home. Bought it as a gift for my husband and was gravely disappointed.One huge song which would be one of Gregory's biggest hit is night nurse. This song was not even on the album.I hope the music section at Amzon could look into this and ensure that customers get exactly what they are promised by posting a list of the songs on the album along with a short sample of the songs to play so people know exactly what they're getting.
1,stick with purple and core..don't bother with this tripe,"if you are a fan of the old stone temple pilots, do not buy this. big dissapointment"
5,bardzo przydatny!,"Fajny slowniczek, mam go zawsze po reka...zwlaszcza jak trudno jest zrozumiec idiomy z ogolnego kontekstu ! polecam goraco wszystkim moim rodakom. :)"
2,"Not Hard Rock, Even For The Seventies","There is nothing even remotely ""Hard Rock"" about this CD. Humble Pie's cut qualifies for the time period, but that's all. Embarassing for anyone down at ""the plant"" who was involved in this misnomer, to be sure. Truth in advertising? It apparently doesn't exist in America anymore. Buyer beware."
2,Not a Hard Rock fan,"I bought this album a long time ago and played it again tonight to see which cd's my daughters may want. (They are visiting from out-of-state this week.) Except for a few songs like ""House of the Rising Sun"", ""Nutrocker"", ""Lucky Man"" and ""Stumblin' In"", I hated this album. The songs consist of nothing but screaming. I guess I'm just not a fan of this type of music."
2,Buyer Beware,"I have owned these for just under six months. In that time I have replaced the batteries six times. The POWER ON LED's have never worked. The left muff now has a noticable static/crackle when active. I agree with the ill concieved battery placement. If I had known about the battery situation from the beginning, I never would have bought them. You have to remove the ear cushion to get to the battery. Because of the tight fit, you have to push against the electronics to get enough purchase to pop them off. A small notch on the outside so a screw driver would have helped.That all said, the low profile is the main reason I purchased these muffs and they deliver in that regard. They do not interfere with my rifle stock."
2,not working correct,It won't work at a shooting range. Maybe the microphones responding to slow. A slower sound will react better but this one does not work at a range
2,"Wasn't bad, wasn't great.",Works for the range. Wouldn't really like it in combat. Good for the money. Six more words required to hit submit.
4,Good product,I hook up my iPhone and listen to music while I am shooting at the range. I also know when people are calling me as well.
2,What a disappointment,"I have had these Peltor 6s muffs since April. They were purchased to replace a pair of Dillons (Made by Peltor) that were over 10 years old. The old Dillons still work, but are in disrepair due to long hard use.I expected the Peltor 6s to be on par, or better than the old product. Not so. The battery installation procedure is a pain. The sound amplification is not nearly as good as the old pair, nor is the sound attenuation. Now the right muff has developed static. I am returning these muffs for refund and will replace them with another brand. What a shame, Peltor has had a reputation for good quality products in the past."
3,Was great while it lasted.,"I bought the 6S headset several years ago through a discount house. They worked great, hearing better than with plain ears, but cuts out the blast of a gunshot nicely. The right earpiece stopped working this year. No visible battery corrosion on the contacts or anything like that, just stopped working. I figured I got my money's worth out of them though, they gave several years of good service. I'm going to try the Howard Leight set as a replacement, and keep the one-eared Peltor set to kick around in the glove box of the truck, for ""emergency use""."
2,DON'T BUY THESE!!,"The battery access (it does'nt come with any) is absolutely stupid. I guarantee you will be breaking the plastic muff ring after it's aged and dried out for 2 years. I had to view an independant online video on battery replacement because it required a massive amount of effort to unsnap the muff cover the get at the battery compartment, and I'm very surprised it did'nt crack in half. PASS."
3,Just Ok...,"J.Ong, Anaheim, CAAfter reading the good reviews this product had, I ordered it. Installing the batteries was a bit challenging since the earcups don't come of easily. After wearing them on the range, had to take it off several times as it does not feel comfortable for long wear. The sound had a slight delay, but that's ok for me though....Overall, it would be nice if the cushions were more comfortable.."
2,not so good,replacing the batteries is kind of challenging . the speak function is interment . bottom line is you get what you pay for..
1,"Bought 2, both died.","I bought 2 of these ear muffs about a year ago and both are sitting in the trash right now. The speakers hiss, pop and squeal loudly when they detect a sound. If I tap on it, it might stop but the next sound can set it off again. The knobs are prone to turning on when in the range bag and the cups are a little too shallow and bottom out on the ears before sealing."
3,Not for long term use,"These muffs work great for shooting and other short term uses. The electronics work well, allowing you to hear conversations and other low volume sounds while blocking loud noises. The spring steel headband holds the earpieces tightly, perhaps too tightly. After wearing them for a day of working with a chain saw it felt like I had had my head in a vice. I tried them again a week later with the same resulting headache. I don't use them now for anything that requires more than about 15 minutes of continuous wear."
4,Nice muffs,Work very well. Would give 5 of 5 if not for the uncomfortable head band. I would recommend for the price.
4,Great for the price.,For the money this thing works really well. I've used better but the others were high dollar. They are awesome for beginning shooters with a limited budget. 4 stars only because lower quality because of price.
2,review of Peltor tactical 6s,replacing the batteries was a real issue and I punctured the ear membrane twice. Have since bought the upgraded ones and so far they are better in function and ease of battery replacement. They are also more effective is cancelling noise and easier to initially adjust. The top is very hard and I had to add a cushion so that they were comfortable. They were light and did not affect my shooting the shotgun.
4,A good All around unit,The Hearing Protector is more that adequate for me in all areas and priced reasonably. I would recommend them to anyone that shoots a lot.
3,not for indoor ranges,"I haven't tried it outdoors yet, but it's useless for indoor ranges. With a NRR of 20, I need earplugs as well, and I still feel percussion. For indoor use I now have some bulky NRR 30 muffs.I'm scheduled for a class at a training facility that requires electronic muffs. I chose these because of the slim lines and the tolerable color. I'd rather have some NRR 27 or higher but couldn't find anything to my price range or tastes."
5,Nice,"What can I say, they work, they are comfortable and I would buy them again when I am in the market"
2,One side problem,I purchased a total of 5 units and one of them did not work from the get go...we were in training for 4 days and had no choice but to use a broken set....Amazon did do an excellent job on refund...
3,SoSo,"This is a product a freind of mine showed me and I thought was great. I could have a conversation and the gunshots in the background were the only thing that was deadned. I expected the same results from this product (i thought was the same set he had) but am not as impressed. It does work, just not as well. Maybe there is some adjustment that i don't know about. Make sure you reasurch this type of product well before you buy."
4,"""Sounds"" Great",I was scared to buy into product because I had not had a chance to 'listen' and/or try them on for size. When I got them.....fell in love with them. Great product for the price! Changing battery was a bit scary but YouTube helped (NOT MY VID BUT IT HELPED): [...]
1,uneceptable,"took 1 hour to get at battery compartment. My fingers were raw trying to get open without distroying. after getting open and insertingbatteries. Right side did not work. could not get back open to check without prying with screwdriver,so did not try with fear ofbrakeing plastic. Sending back and orderd the tactical 7s with a more pratical solution ."
5,Peltor 97044 Tactical 6S,"I took this headset to a handgun class on 3/27/2010 and a Rifle class on 3/28/2010.3/27 was cold but sunny and the headset ran fine all day.3/28 was over cast all day and rained the whole 8 hours of the class.The Peltor 6S held up very well in the rain and cold both days with zero issues.While I normally use earplugs and a heaset, a head cold was preventing me from hearingnormal voice levels with plugs and the headset.I switched to just the headset and could hear normal voice levels just fine while stillmaintaining hearing protection with the 6S noise reduction."
2,One large flaw in the design,"I really like the Peltor hearing protectors and they work great. They fit better than some other brand that I have. However the one bad drawback to the design is that the batteries are very difficult to get into. One must pry off the ear pad then replace the batteries underneat. I cannot do it with my fingers alone because the flange nearly cuts into my skin. I must use a screw driver. Surely there is a better design. I hate this about them. If one has arthritis, you can't do it. I have lost some muscle strength after taking statins for cholesterol and I cannot do it with my fingers."
4,Hear and Gone,"this is a good quality hearing protector , fold small, fit well, deliver noise suppression in a nano second.they are not the best out there but are an exceptional value not costing $150.00 or more.i wear them at the range with soft protection inside my ears.the amplification lets me hear important conversion, and spoken range commands"
1,Not good enough,I have had Peltor products before and was satisfied. However the 6S did not work properly from the beginning. One side was not functioning. Another complaint is the difficulty in removing batteries. Very poor design for opening the case. Would not recommend thase
3,Great except for....,"Bought mine and they have been working fine.I do agree with the volume knob being a pain in the ares and killing many batteries.To remove the cups to change batteries leaves something to be desired.Now to the new thing... my outer cups are cracking one has cracked from the top to almost the middle and the other about 3/4"" long from the top as well. I haven't seen any known issues online regarding this. It is not from abuse that is for sure. I have owned these for about 4 months. I love them but I guess I will have to find a way to reinforce them."
5,Perfect!,The ear muffs are great. They arrived on the correct date and work just like I imagined. I am very content with my purchase.
2,Not as good as expected,"I tried these on at the store and they seemed great. I guess I should have read the reviews here more before buying them. I bought these to use for trap/clay shooting and was not very happy at all. #1 they do not block the sound very well, #2 there was a slight delay until they shut off loud sound, and when I turned them up I heard a faint hissing. Being used to foam earplugs, they felt & sounded a lot different. I could have gotten used to all the shortcomings if they fit better, meaning, when I mounted my shotgun they would hit on the stock. It was very distracting, even if I could have adjusted the fit or my mount slightly, it was too distracting to be worth dealing with. I didnt even shoot a full line, maybe 1 or 2 posts, max and took them off & sent them back. Thank goodness Amazon has an excellent return policy!"
1,Not impressed,One side worked and the other side got hot and one battery started to melt. I must say the company I got it from was great about returning the product. They paid for the return no excuses.
2,Peltor Tactical 6S,"Found a problem right off the bat: very difficult to remove hard band from inside of metal cup to install batteries. Multiple slips of small screwdriver while trying to pry off 'hard' band from metal case punctured soft band. Manual suggestive method did not work at all.You should know that 2 AAA batteries are required for each earphone.I have not tried with shooting yet, but now that batteries are installed, I plan to shoot this afternoon. Afterwards, I will further review."
2,Overrated,"Sound quality was on par with my $29 Caldwell units, and those run about the same size overall. having to run batteries in both sides a negative for me, especially when you have to work so hard to get each side open. i never got the one side installed at all, so label me only partially biased in sound quality.There are better options, and if they weren't on sale, it would be a shame to waste the money on them. Back to Amazon they go. Next guy gets 2 free batteries, I cant get the things out."
5,Outstanding.,I bought it for shooting. It works outstanding. Use it when my wife snores. So comfortable I can sleep in it with a smile on my face.
1,MOISTURE COLLECTION IS A REAL PAIN!!!,"These ear phones seem to work well, however after several hours Persperation collects and is trapped in the ear peaces resulting in static noise. I called tech support and she acknowledged that this was a problem and the recommended solution is to remove the ear cushions and let dry. The removal and reinstallation of the ear cushions is a real pain, not to mention drying parts laying around and unavailiablity of the device while drying. This probably will not be a problem for those using the Tactical 6-S for short periods, but, I tend to wear them for hours at a time and the moisure collection and condensation has been a problem on both hot and cold days."
4,Pretty good,"Overall, I think the Tactical 6-S hearing protectors are good. It's a little tough to get ear cups out to change the batteries though. You can use the ""pull really hard method"" or use a screw driver to pop the ear cups out. I recommend the screw driver method if you can find one that fits into the little slot."
5,Very pleased with these.,"Picked these up for IDPA and I absolutely love them. I personally have bought 4 pairs (Me, Dad, Grandpa, and a buddy). And I've convinced 3 other shooters to pick these up.If you're a regular shooter and have never used electronic ear muffs you owe it to yourself to pick up a set. The savings IS REAL, I still see retail stores selling these for $125+ as well as finding online retailers selling for WAY more."
4,product great amazon poor,"I ordered this item 10 days before I returned to Iraq, I had a set before and had given them away upon finishing my last tour, the product is great but amazon took 10 days to finally ship them which did not help me seeing as I was leaving in 11. The peltors showed up at my family's home two days after i left and are still in the mail on the way to me in Iraq(it will be a month before I get them). I have noticed a steady decline in Amazon's shipping and am not happy with it at all."
4,Great Desk Reference,This is an excellent desk reference for when you forget certain things. It's easy to find things and well written.
3,OK,Some of these giant Microsoft desktop software books are a bit strange. SAS does a much better job on their educational material. It could be presented much more concisely and clearly.
4,Bible Study,"This is my second MS-related Bible purchase and I really do love the series. The Excel Bible gets a little technical and somewhat over my head as a slightly above-average user, but it's really good information. I always shyed away from macros, but it (and a few experts) really helped me write macros for a file that's being distributed company-wide.Just like a real Bible, I just want to be able to reference it when I need to."
2,Not up to date,"John is a great writer. I have a number of his books in my library.Unfortunately, he's not keeping up with the product. The primary changes in Excel 2003 (xml, SharePoint integration, InfoPath, etc) are essentially missing from his Book.Its like he took the Excel 2000 version of his Bible pretty much just changed the cover.I returned my copy."
3,"As a quick-reference guide, it does the job well.","My confidence in this guide was tarnished somewhat due to the fact that the very first spreadsheet I opened on the accompanying disc (CH 22, ""real estate.xls"") had an obvious formula error. However, I purchased it as a quick reference guide rather than an full-on instructional guide, so for that purpose it has done the job well. It helps solve those ""I know Excel does this task, but I just cannot remember how to tell it what I want!"" problems with relative ease and the index has thus far been very detailed and accurate."
1,"Íf you need fast answers, don't buy this book","This is supposed to be ""the"" bible on Excell. And it is; it has everything there's to know. BUT, if you need to get your answers fast in order to get your work done, don't buy this book. This book, as well as other ""bibles"" series, are design with a whole CD program with sample exercises. If you go thru them, step by step, you'll learn your stuff. But, if you just need to get into the topic of getting something done quickly, you will find that their explanation is EXACTLY AS THE HELP FUNCTION ON THE SOFTWARE. And then, the will give you an example from that CD program. Believe me, if you don't want to go thru the whole reading process and just need answers in a need basis, this book won't do it. The same applies to the Access Bible..."
3,Not recommended for Proficient+ Users,"This is a great level 1-2 book, but if you are proficient (not necessarily an expert, but familiar with Pivot Tables, simple formulas (lookups, sumifs, etc), then this is too broad an overview for you. Like other reviews advise, all of the info is available for free on-line elsewhere. When I need to find something, I have been searching the net, because what I call something, may not be what the book calls it, but other people do. Once I find it on-line, then I backtrack into the book with the ""official"" term and only then can I find it."
2,Not the Bible the title suggests,"This book, although broad in scope, fails to cover important aspects with enough depth. It is a hefty volume, close to 900 pages, but you would expect to have a lot more information available in such massive space, but most of it is blank spaces and big titles and subtitles. In fact, most of the information available here is available in the Excel help and MS Office support website (free). So, if you are looking for a printed version of Excel's online help, go for it, but if you are trying to find in-depth information and guidance, this is not the book for you."
4,Microsoft excel 2003 bible,"This is a good reference, especially helpful is the CD included. It would be helpful to someone just learning excel, but also goes into some depth of higher level functions."
5,Book + E-Book + Examples ...O My,Chock full of examples and a searchable e-book. Excellent value for money.
1,BIBLE MY WHATEVER,"This book sucks! I cannot even believe that the author or publisher can refer to this piece of WHATEVER as a Bible! The first 600 pages only REFERENCE (and by reference, I mean DO NOT describe in any detail that is usable) the basics of Excel that many of us learned in introductory computer classes. I bought this book to learn more about Visual Basic Editor (VBE) and UserForms. Unfortunately, this 'Bible' only recommends another book by the same author devoted to these topics. This was a serious waste of $40!! I honestly think that new users to Excel could benefit from the free Excel tutorials that are offered online or by using one of those books made for 'dummies' that are MUCH cheaper!"
5,"Incredible for campers, outdoor lovers","This book is great, it tells you all the information you would ever need to know about living in the wild (i.e. makeshift fishing, what to eat, etc.). It even has illustrations of plants that are edible. For camping and such this is the perfect handbook."
1,motown dance review by josephine yong,"there is good tune you can dance over and over again ""LET IT WHIP"" by the dazz band. the rest are funky wild music not for elective taste."
5,Anyone think it's weird....,"That we're all from Ann Arbor? >:P Seriously though, this album is dope. And besides, who else is gonna shout out the 734?"
1,"1.5mm Sterling Silver 30"" Bead or Ball Chain Necklace","The chain is poorly made. It broke between the fastner link and the chain shortly after receiving and wearing it. The chain is not made strong enough for daily use. Don't buy, buy a heavier chain and pay the higher price. You get want you pay for. Now the chain is useless. Wasted money."
2,Volumes 1 and 2 Hot!!! Volumes 3 and 4 Not as Hot...,"Volumes 1 and 2 are must haves. You will play those for the long run. Volumes 3 and 4 have a lot of tracks for which you can just hit the ff/skip/next button. I wonder what #5 will be. What was hot about 1 and 2 is that they were far away from and better than what gets played on the radio. It now seems that hidden beach is headed to that corner of the jazz segment called mainstream. I worry that #5 will be more hip hop and less jazz and more for my son than for me. After all, if I were the VP of marketing, that's what I would do. I bought #1 and #2 and just about every song was a hit. Buy this CD and you'll have to skip around a lot to find the hits. Check Napster or Walmart and pay 99cents for each of the 4 songs on here you'll play over and over again. Be cautious about going all out and buying this whole CD."
5,Excellent,"The Unwrapped series continues to get better and better. If you like Jazz, Hip Hop and R&B, you must get this CD."
5,amazing,It is one of the best movies which i have ever seen. It is a good combination between fun and lovestory!!
1,Gross and not funny,"I love comedies of all sorts including much of the National Lampoon offerings (American Pie, Step Brothers, Pineapple Express to give a quick sampling). This is terrible. It appeals to the lowest common denominator and offers nothing but bad sex and bathroom jokes. I love good sex and bathroom jokes; Van Wilder has none. Ryan Reynolds' acting is the one positive giving it the one requisite star. Really, just not funny."
2,Was their something I missed?,"I'm not sure why so many people loved this movie. Was their a joke I didn't get which made the rest of the movie funny? My brother said that this was the best movie he had seen this year. He can't have seen many. A friend of mine said this was amazing, so I went to see it with two other friends, and we normally find most movies funny, but for some reason, not this one. Sure, it had it's moments, but most movies do, and I thought this was an average movie. I have seen worse, but I have seen better... a lot better movies this year. At least I'm not the only one, a few other reviewers also didn't rate this too high."
2,Not That Great,"This is definitely NOT one of National Lampoon's better efforts. If you are expecting a movie on the same level as""Vacation"", ""European Vacation"", ""Christmas Vacation"", or ""Animal House"" (which WERE National Lampoon's best, IMHO)get set to be bitterly disappointed. There are a few (very few) humorous scenes, but they are widely scattered throughout a running mediocre and ho-hum stream of drivel and inanity.(""Make a note of that"")Top this off with Van Wilder's ""assistant"" from India whosebad accent is execeeded only by his bad lines and you have a movie pegging dangerously close to the ""Loser"" mark. Glad I only paid a dollar for it used -- any more would have been really tossing my money away."
3,Tara Reid!,"Ryan Reynolds and Tara Reid star in this bouncy(sort-of) re-make of ""Animal House"". Wilder wants to stay in college(after 7 years), and Daddy says no! The ending is a hoot! 2004's ""Along Came Polly"" is a mild rip-off of ""Wilder"", with it's bathroom humor and male nudity. But good ideas never die.."
4,Funny!,very Funny movie but not good for anyone under 17 years old. Good movie when nothing else is on to watch.
3,High bitrate AVC encode ---> Marginal picture quality,"First of all, I loved the movie. The audio is spectacular, the video marginal. They used an AVC encode that is always over 30Mbps which should yield a top-tier image. Unfortunately the result is less than spectacular.Buy it if you like the movie. Skip it if you already have the DVD."
3,Comedy and Age!,"National Lampoon's Van Wilder; in my opinion a very funny movie, however there will be many whom are of my age group (40-60) whom may disagree with me because it is a younger generation that I believe the movie was meant for. I happen to be 57yrs of age, but still young at heart. I find this type of humor a rebellious form of expression, and find the movie and characters, a great way to enjoy an afternoon or evening just to get in touch with the real world of youth that I hope never to loose! Buy this movie and sit back and just laugh and live a little. Always keep an open mind. As this type of humor is a bit risk-ay!Sincerely, Bart Black"
5,Hilarious!,Just watched this movie a few months ago for the first time - thought it was hilarious and a little raunchy (of course it has to be raunchy if it's a National Lampoon movie). But this wasn't just a silly movie (like several of these) - thought it was a pretty good story too and love Ryan Reynolds!
5,Hysterical,"You'll never be able to eat an eclaire or canoli again! Its one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. College humor, but not quite the ""Animal House"" of this generation. It is worth the money to rent or buy, I recommend this movie. The DVD has some great features... The un-rated vision is the only way to go."
4,great movie..but i want to buy his hat..or one like it,This was a great movie...i've seen it six or seven times now. But my real interest is to purchase the VW hat that Van is wearing in the movie. Is there someone who can help me with product information related to this movie?
3,It has it's moments...,"Of which I FF to. But as a movie? The show doesn't hold much interest. A movie like ""Asian and Indian guy goes to White Castle"" (I don't recall their names but if you've seen it you'll know) gives you a cohesive journey to enjoy. Van Wilder tries to update ""Animal House"" but fails by putting too much upon one character to hold it up."
1,Van Dumber,"Let's put it this way: it takes a lot more than farting strippers and a dog with giant testicles to make me laugh. Should we have to watch another wannabe actor try to distinguish himself by doing what looks like a bad Jim Carey impression throughout the movie? What do you call toilet humor without the humor? Will Tara Reid ever act, or will she be stuck in an eye-candy phone booth forever? Is sex talk supposed to be funny just because it's coming out of the mouth of an ethnic guy with an accent? When a movie has nothing else going for it, is throwing in a pair of naked boobs really going to make much difference? These are but some of the questions ""Van Wilder"" poses.Here's a tip for the guys over at National Lampoon:Animal House = a funny movie about idiotsVacation = a very funny movie about an idiotVan Wilder = an unfunny movie starring, and made by, idiotsMoral: Comedies are supposed to be funny."
4,Loved the E'Clair Scene!,"I just loved this kooky screwy, funny movie, full of hijinx! I think this one beats Animal House for screwball college comedy!Two hard thumbs WAY up!!!MC White said: Check it out!"
3,"Decent ""Frat"" Movie: No More, No Less","NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER is a decent comedy that lies in the shadow of ANIMAL HOUSE. There are parts of this movie that had me laughing hysterically. There are other parts where the crude humor fell completely flat and even I was a little taken aback (and that is saying something). One interesting part of this film is that it seems to get tired with the ""campus craziness"" routine and opt for a college romance movie instead. I'm not sure whether I approve of the decision. As a college comedy, VAN WILDER ranks among the better ones, but it cannot really maintain any believability for its love story. Overall, I was entertained by this film, but its somewhat inexperienced cast give it a bit of an ""amateur"" feel. Check it out if you love ""fraternity"" movies or enjoy simple comedies."
2,Could've been so much better,"There's a real story here - a guy who on the surface looks like a slacker and perpetual partier. But then we learn that he does tons of charity fundraisers and secretly organizes parties for nerds, who need a little help with their social lives. He even helps talk a guy out of killing himself. Unfortunately, all of that is lost in really bad humor. In particular, the Bulldog pastry-eating scene. Then there's the tired, overdone jokes: the sex-starved old-woman, the sex-starved foreign exchange student, the sex-starved high-IQ nerds. Tara Reid's character is devoid of personality, and her boyfriend, naturally, is completely unlikable. Reynolds is funny, but he could do so much better with a better movie. As best it's disappointing, at worst it's disqusting. Rent it when you have a freebie coupon."
1,"a disgusting, terrible movie","Wow. I saw this movie (most of it) two days ago. Several scenes in this movie are so disgusting I almost {got sick}, and I've watched people doing nasty things on {other shows} without flinching. Despite all that, the plot is paper-thin and ranks of cheese. But if that's your bag, by all means, go crazy."
1,Holy ... is this Bad!,"Having read reviews ranging from very positive to very negative, I decided to find out for myself. All I can say is ""Stay Away!""Tara Reid seemed like a walking corpse through this flick, and the characters were weak, the jokes not funny, and the story non-existant. A poor excuse of an American Pie rip-off.The only bright spot in the film is Ryan Renolds as Van, but even he got tired quickly."
1,Animal House -- NOT,"This film provides a hackneyed plot that I presume is supposed to be a vehicle for some really gnarly gross-out humour (of the Something About Mary variety). While I smiled a bit at a couple of the gags, mostly the movie was really slow and lame. For instance a key scene involves Van Wilder trying to talk a guy out of suicide while not wearing any pants. I mean that's not a joke, it's just stupid. It might be funny if you are drunk enough, but this is about 20 steps below American Pie (think American Pie II) and is not worth the price of a rental, much less purchasing.Comparing this to the original Animal House is like comparing Mozart to Britney Spears. Avoid at all costs."
2,just ok,"Ryan Reynolds is the Chevy Chase of his era&that can be good or bad depending on where you stand. I enjoy the humor in this film to a certain point&then it gets run of the Mill.I must say though Tara Reid was a Hot looking Momma,YES Double LAWWDD!! that chick had something in her eye-balls that made me look.but this film despite bringing back Tim Matheson from the films back in the day that were cut in this vein,has alot of hit&miss about it. it was Ok."
3,"Not Animal House, but not that bad either.","Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder) has a unique style of sarcasm reminiscent of Otter (Tim Matheson) from Animal House, who incidentally plays his father.This film depicts the life of a 7-year student (Reynolds) who is forced to finally pay his own tuition after his father (Matheson) decides he is no longer going to amount to anything. There are some gross moments, some funny moments, and some down right lame moments. The lame moments brought my rating down to 2 stars, but some of the supporting cast brought it back up to 3. These character's are quite entertaining. Van's assistant Taj (Kal Penn) is entertaining. As is his rival for Tara Reid's affection (Daniel Cosgrove), his entire fraternity is the epitimy of why not to ever pledge."
3,Not as bad as I expected,"This movie is definitely not a masterpiece and it has its share of stupid, toilet humor kind of jokes. But if you will be able to put all this stuff aside what's left is nice, light romantic comedy. Good acting by Ryan Reynolds (playing a guy that so used to life at the campus he doesn't want to graduate). Even Tara Reid is adequate. You can enjoy this movie if you don't expect much from it."
5,Great Comedy,"This is a great comedy that is snappy and well-acted... it is fun, fun, fun, and one of the best National Lampoon flicks. It is up there with Buying The Cow, Office Space, Christmas Vacation, and Las Vegas Vacation. It is well directed and moves along at a good clip. Some of the scenes are the funniest I have ever seen and some of the outtakes on the DVD are just as great. Highly Recommended."
4,Shout Out To Van For his take on Air Supply,"Very entertaining flick which solidified a place in my DVD collection due to the great scene in which a ""dulled out"" Van whips out his guitar and sings along with Air Supply's ""All out of love"" (the greatest love song of all time by one of the most underrated bands of the 80's)!...GUILTY PLEASURE Indeed!..."
1,Won't buy used items,"I already wrote a review, but to reiterate, I was extremely disappointed. Amazon is my favorite place to shop. All other purchases are stellar. But this is a lesson in that I will not buy another used item. This particular CD I bought had the wrong CD in the jewel case. I was looking for a particular song and I ultimately found it in another brand new CD compilation."
1,Gist of the Bible,"The content of this book is excellent, but the print of this paperback book is small with large white margins. I wish I had bought a 1979 publication, hardback and better quality print."
4,Hand Saver,"I mostly used this to protect my hands when using a metal stamp. It is a great product, and has a wide application for various diameters of tooling."
3,Different pictures sent and starting age should be higher,"Quality is adequate, perhaps slightly overpriced. It was the only set I could find with a young enough starting age for my 6 year old; all the other sets I found started from 8. The pictures in the set were different from the ones on the Internet site, but thankfully they were still themed mainly for a boy. Also, I question the manufacturer's starting age of 6. Comparing it to sets in Michaels and Target, it seems no different and they recommend the minimum age to be 8. My son is going to find it difficult to paint such small areas required for this set, that I might put it away for a year until he is older."
5,Excellent for the Novice!,"Max Lucado's books are awesome, inspirational and help the reader study and get meaning from the word. An enjoyable tool to enhance dialog and understanding and make the bible live for you."
2,Not for home bars,"This book failed to deliver cocktail recipes that use common ingredients found in home bars. Even my own modest home bar, which I spent quite a bit on to stock for various tastes, was always missing some exotic ingredient required for almost every recipe contained in this book. I'd recommend the book if you have access to a very wide range of ingredients, but for everyone else, there are better books out there."
3,funny hat,"Nice quality hat. It does seem to be well made. However, I would not recommend this item for someone with a larger or even medium adult head size. I am a skinny female with small to average head and it was tight on me."
4,Nice hat for small heads,If you have a hat size that is over 6 and 3/4 inches this hat won't fit you very well. Other than that its a great hat for Jimmy Buffett concerts!!!!
4,Neat,"""Whose Side Are You On?"" is about a girl named Barbra. She is 11 years old, and getting pretty bad grades. Her mom hires a math tutor who is coincidentally her worst enemy. But when he disappears, Barbra is the one that sets out to look for him. An interesting read!"
4,"Hmm, Interesting","I would say that this book was pretty good. It was really easy for me to read,though. But I did like the book. It was interesting and fun to read. I was always wondering what was going to happen next. But sometimes I could just guess. This is the first book that I can remember reading that was like this. That is unless you count novels that your friends have written that was on an African American family. If it was like that then I would like my friends better, because it had to do with our age group and kind of based on our life. I really don't know what else to say. Except that it was easy to read. It only took me a day to read it. I think that kids on a lowere reading level would enjoy this book."
4,"""Nice""",A good buy to experiment on Steve's techniques on the stick accompanied by this creative percussionist David Langlois. Great grooves and runs and ofcourse not to miss out on Steve's styles on the stick. GOOOOOOOOD Stuff
1,Not very happy...,"This book was not a hard back, so when I recieved it ONLY wrapped in paper with no shrink wrap, the corners were sticking out of the paper!! One corner was bent, and the book was brand new!! I would have liked it sent better!"
1,Aptly titled,"I have seen the Grand Canyon, gazed down through its many rock layers, and stared in awe at the Great Unconformity at its base, taking me from a mere 525 million years ago, to 1,200 million years before that.Anyone who would prefer to believe that it was carved by the waters of a mythical Middle Eastern flood is indeed ""over the edge"". Anyone who misuses the great religious writings as scientific texts has no understanding of either science or religion."
1,Shipping is outrageous!,"6.10 shipping for a under 2 dollar purchase, and about envelope weight? Forget that."
3,Dance Floor Hits Disco Nights Vol. 8,"The cover says, ""Extended long play club versions!"", but only 5 out of 12 songs are longer than 5 minutes. I've heard the album version of ""Makin' It"" (the reason why I bought this compilation) and this ain't it. The long version is at least 5 minutes and this is 3:08. This version of ""Bridge over Troubled Water"" is only 3:18, but the mix I already have is at least 9 minutes.Save your money if you like long play."
3,disco nigths vol. 8,"The tracks ""Brazil, She Works Hard For The Money, Ain't That Enough for You and Hot Stuff are surprising. Hot Stuff is the 12"" version. I was expecting that ""Makin' It-by David Naughton would be longer but it's not. Hopefully, a longer version of this can be found in future releases."
3,ROCKWELL IS THE ONLY GOOD THING!,"This cd is good because Rockwell plays ""Somebody's Watching Me"" on it and that is the best song in the world! The 3 stars are for Rockwell and only Rockwell, I don't listen to any other tracks, Just # 1! Rockwell all the way!"
1,Tore after 1 month,"Poor quality, the bottom tore after 1 month, I never had anything heavy in there."
1,Never arrived.,"I ordered product roughly a month ago and it has yet to arrive. To be honest, I would like my money back. By far the worst service I have experienced while ordering from Amazon."
1,horrible lasted 2weeks and started to fray,this item sucks... it lasted 2weeks .. my son walked home from school and the bottom ripped apart... his books fell to the ground.. he had to carry them home and i had to sew the backsack together again ... and of course it ripped again in another spot and i just had to go and buy him another one at a better store
5,For anyone who needs a convenient tote,These totes are well designed and durable. I highly recommend. Perfect for people who tote things to work and home.
2,"ok, but not the best","One of the bags is already tearing on the side. Oh well, what do you expect for $2.95."
1,No Idea what you are talking about.,I did not order any red drawstring backpack. There is obviously a mistake somewhere. I gave this One Star because there was no other way to send this to you. Someone is tinkering with my account.Ronald Kalicak
1,not put together well,son loves it but it always falls down when he tosses the little bags at it. so he gets bored with it fast ever time he has to pick it back up
2,More BRAINS please,"Brain should have been a little larger (looks like a kids brain), I can not use this brain for what i needed. Brain would be ok for a Haunted house prop or for a child dressed as a zombie chewing on a snack. WARNING, brain will not fulfill your desire of an adult brain. Schroeder (Cult Movies Magazine)"
3,Small brain -- ok for younger children,This brain has a good shape but I was expeceting it to look like the picture and it does not. It is smaller than a regular adult brain -- maybe this is a child size. It does not look like a real brain a little dorkey looking -- but for small children it will work.
3,smells bad,This prop is okay but it was a bit smaller than I expected. The main problem was that it smelled really bad. This could be a problem in a small space. It didn't seem to go away even after a few days. I haven't checked recently so it could be better now. It looked okay for what I needed.
2,Its a Brain,Not really as pictured. The brain is small like a child's brain and looks very plastic even from far. Guess I was looking for something a little more realistic. Speaking of which I gotta go search for a bone saw now. Hopefully its Prime eligible.
5,Bloody Brain is very kewl!,"So glad we ordered this, we have it floating in a big jar with colored water. Very neat prop for a Halloween party or just for decoration. I love it! Might order a second one!"
1,A bit disappointed,I thought this book was just a spin off from A Course In Miracles. The same thread was throughout the entire book. I thought perhaps if it was Gloria's story that it would be her words and not ACIM.I was really disappointed
5,Excellent early Mclean...,"I'm really only writing this to even the average rating out to a more respectable 4 stars...the only reason to dock this 1956 recording at all is that this recording does not push to the outer limits of the Bop formula the way Mclean would on later efforts like the mind-blowing ""Destination Out!"" But Mclean and Byrd are in top form here; the tunes are spectacular. This session is evidence of the rich product of the 1950's jazz scene. This record may be average, given a climate dominated by dozens of artists with high caliber sessions coming out every year, but that does not mean it does not objectively merit a five-star rating."
2,Plastic crud! Don't buy it!,"Wonder why it""s no longer available? It's CR@P! This is not like the old red rubber hoses you ran over on your way into a service station to ring the bell. Or the rubber hoses they use to fill tires at the air pump. I've been a carpenter for over 30 years and run a lot of stuff off of air lines. These are not the Goodyear air lines you are looking for. The kink and coil factor is off the charts! Run away from these!See???? They even discontinued them!!!!!"
5,My daughter loves it,It was hard to find a pink case for my daughter but amazon has everything. The shipping was prompt and the item was exacly as discribed and fits well on the i-pod. I highly recomend this seller.
5,Perfect!,"This Silicone 1st/2nd gen Ipod Nano Case is great!Inexpensive and does what it is supposed it do! Perfect! It's lasted me about a year and a half now and I am just now writing the review, oops, but I figured I'd give it props!"
5,Very Nice Collection of Krupa in the 50's,"This is a wonderful collection mostly made up of Mr. Krupa's fine small group playing. If you are only familiar with the Gene Krupa of the 30's and the Goodman/Big band era this disc may surprise you. Krupa was at the top of his game during these sessions.Some of the personnel who support Krupa on these recordings include: Ben Webster, Lionel Hampton, Teddy Wilson, Charlie Shavers, Eddie 'Lockjaw' Davis, and Ray Brown."
2,good...,"well the size its not realy medium, it is bigger than common M sized polo.. the color is ""unique"" and perfect and the cotton is very nice ...the polo is fine but the size dont match with a medium polo..i cant use it"
1,Bad mix of songs,"Yeesh. Who slapped this collection together? Great songs mixed in with slush. Not the most dancey reggae either. Some of it's (arguably) not even reggae. If you're looking for dance reggae check out Toots & the Maytals ""Reggae Got Soul"" or ""Funky Kingston."""
3,"""George Harrison"" is super cute!","Bah! You read my diary! Udi Subudi, you lovingly put to words how I feel about Georgie Harrison."
2,PAWs,"An awful lot of verse, but very few meaningful song verses. The only one that cameeven close to what I was looking for (words to music I have, or listen to on the radio),was the Battle Hymn of The Republic. Most of the rest was blank poetry that I don't think everwas put to music."
1,Yewww.........,"After seeing the previews for this movie, I was looking forward to seeing family life with the female characters and their children. The children decide to seek out their father and the storyline looked promising. What it turned into was a sleazy affair between Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo---betrayal, hurt and lost relationships--too much of that already. Hollywood writers are stale and use sex because they have no imaginations. Zero stars--viewer beware."
2,Disappointed,"Given the great reviews and honors I expected something special. But there wasn't a moment I wasn't aware of a script being acted out, actors being minutely directed (not one actor at any time looked relaxed or spontaneous), and some sort of social agenda going on, though for the life of me I still can't figure what that agenda was. I found the father being cast out as the Devil and the mother who strayed being all sunshine, light and goodness treated as an angel at the end illogical and a false note. But, then, the whole film kept striking false notes for me. I guess one problem is I've known so many gay people with kids and in my experience nothing unusual or conflicting goes on in their lives that doesn't go on in anyone's lives. And none of their lives would make a movie, that's for sure.Adrift in the Heartland"
2,The plot point that spoils the movie,"I really wanted to like this film but when one of the ""Lesbian"" Woman starts an affair with a ""Straight"" male, they lost me. Being Gay isn't something you can change or turnoff like the Julianne Moore character.Since a Lesbian Woman wrote this film, you would expect that she wouldn't take the easy way out and go with the cliched plot point. If you can get past this, you may like the movie.How is it that it turns out to be the Mans fault at the end? They tell him to get out of their life but they are the ones who sought him out. It takes two to tango and the Woman was just as much responsible.What does she get? One night on the couch.Good performances for sure but the script really needed some work."
3,Expected more,"Between the sparkling reviews and the cast, I expected something a lot more substantial.The story line is promising -- what happens when kids seek out their ""biological father"" sperm donor and this disrupts a family's lives? -- but the movie doesn't deliver on its potential. Instead, it meanders, taking a lengthy look at this family with little real purpose besides a few soap opera moments interspersed with a lot of tedious daily life (along with some supporting characters who are so one-dimensional as to be all but pointless.) A better script might have helped."
4,Entertaining and moving story of a very modern family,"This is one of those modern, unconventional California families: two lesbian moms who have given birth to a son and daughter by way of a sperm donor, whom the kids choose to meet when they get old enough to do so. Conflicts ensue as the couple's problems surface with a vengeance, one partner has a fling with the donor daddy, and the kids are caught up in the turmoil.The actors turn in very strong performances here, and the script and direction are good as well. It is not suitable for everyone; the very traditional or strictly religious will be put off by the lovemaking between the women, although it is not graphic; and by the whole arrangement of their family. Others, though, may enjoy it."
1,Had promise,"Maybe heterosexual people like this movie? I'm unsure, but being a true lesbian myself in a committed relationship I saw this film over dinner with my other and our straight girl-friends; we were all horrified at how the plot twisted and turned. The stereotypes that were played out and the fact that the main character sleeps with a man - or no reason really was ridiculous. (Not realistic what-so-ever to real life). We all were a bit upset we spent any amount of money to watch this movie. I do love the actress Moore, but she wasted her talent here."
4,An Interesting Modern-Day Story. Rather Well Done.,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""The Kids Are All Right"" on DVD. It concerned two women who lived together and had kids by the same male donor. Okay, it's a bit unusual but it could easily happen in this day and age. In any case, the kids discover their father and contact him, much to his surprise. A warm friendship develops between them and their biological father and between him and the two women and he ultimately has an affair with one. It's an interesting modern-day story and rather well done, and in good taste I might add. The acting is excellent. The directing is good. The story seems completely believable, although I dozed off toward the end. It's a worthwhile movie.Gary Peterson"
1,"The kids are all right, but this movie's not!","Very disappointing movie. Actually, the movie really sucked. Did anyone in production/creation of this movie ever meet a lesbian couple???? Apparently not... First, what's up with the flower-child dialogue? No one really talks like that; in California or anywhere else. Right on?? I guess someone was trying to follow a stereotype of granola, crunchy, non-confrontational lesbians...? I didn't see any Birkenstocks though... hmmm... the rest of the dialogue was meaningless fluff... it was impossible to care about any of the characters since they were so poorly created. And since when do lesbians watch gay male porn?? Are you kidding me??? And of course, one of them HAS to have sex with a man...Don't waste your time."
1,Can't believe this was nominated for ANY Oscars...,"Another dismal offering in the long line of crummy movie portrayals of lesbians (by straight actresses, of course). Just because someone can act does it mean it's a good movie? The plot ""twist"" is incredibly lame and unbelievable, and other than Joni the characters aren't likable. Seems like the director threw in a bunch of gratuitous sex and drug scenes just to get an R rating..."
2,"Unbelievable, Uninteresting","The acting was good, the idea had potential, but the story wasn't particularly compelling. It's interesting to tell a store about marriage and recovery in the setting of an old lesbian couple. But, I just didn't believe it. Neither of the choices the female leads take are particularly believable. It broken my disbelieve and ruined the movie for me."
3,Just alright,"This is an oft told story about a marriage in which one of the the partners does not feel validated, valued or heard and what happens when someone who does validate, value and hear comes on the scene. The acting was good, particularly on the part of Annette Bening but the movie was disappointingly slow and predictable. I agree with other reviewers that the rave reviews are a bit surprising. Most likely it is the contemporary gender twist that moves this into the arena of being edgy. Not a bad movie but one that was disappointing."
4,"Very funny, but flawed","I laughed out loud throughout the movie, it has some really great lines. The acting is incredible, even though Annette Bening seems to be channeling the stereotypical lesbian archetype too much, and it was hard not to feel like her family would be better off without her.The only downside is that the ending is not strong enough, but I guess the point is that it is supposed to be this slice of life type movie, that's not meant to tie up all of the loose ends."
1,dont believe the hype,i was looking forward to seeing this movie and it turns out to be the worse movie that i have ever seen
1,Heartwarming Family Movie--Hardly,"I gave this movie 1 star because it wouldn't let me choose 0 stars. I chose this movie because it was a comedy and the description said ""heart-warming"" modern family movie. I only watched 2 minutes of this movie before I realized that it was not something that was going to warm my heart. The first scene showed a teenage girl considering sex, the second scene showed 2 teenage boys snorting drugs and getting into a big fight, and the third scene showed the two teenagers sitting down with their gay female parents for dinner. All this in the space of 2 minutes! Since I disliked all of the characters from the very beginning it seemed pointless to continue watching. I think the description should have referred to a comedy about a ""modern dysfunctional family with serious problems"". If you are a traditional family values oriented person I would recommend you stay far away from this movie."
2,Lesbian Love?,"I am so tired of Hollywood, and indies, getting on the bandwagon for lesbian rights, showing them to be so, so Normal. Give me a break; lesbians raising two kids is NOT normal. I'ts wierd."
1,What next?,"Not only does Hollywood have no more new ideas, but the ones they come up with are just trash!I cannot believe that anyone would really like this movie, and I must not be alone because it was not released to the masses!This is border line brain washing. It is clearly another thread to push these values on America. To try to show it is okay and acceptable because we made a movie about it.I wish I could give it zero stars.This is truly gutter trash!"
1,Gag me with a spoon,"And every other cliche you can think of! There was NOTHING REAL about these women, their 'love' life, their parenting. The dialogue was embarrassing. The only believable character on the screen was the dad -- enough said!"
3,Great movie!,When I opened the package there was food residue or something all over the back of the disc. It was as if a child played with it after lunch. Luckily after a good wash with soap and water it all came off and there were no scratches! Good buy! It was way cheaper than in the store.
1,A wasted opportunity!,"I cannot understand they hype over this work - the characters are paper thin, the quality of acting questionable, but most disturbing are the negative images that are conveyed in this work about single sex parenting. The inter-relationships are totally disfunctional and the ""message"" - if there is indeed one - is confused.I would not have expected such badly crafted material to have been offered by a lesbian director.I am just so pleased and happy that my daughter who has two mothers has the privilege of being a totally whole and rounded person in the middle of a normal and loving extended family environment.This was an opportunity to show mainstream that single sex families can be just as functional as ""traditional"" families are perceived as being. That opportunity was lost - in spades!"
1,"Well, the KIDS are all right, but the adults....","Well, yes, the kids are all right - but with little thanks to the so-called adults around them. I am a huge proponent of same-sex marriage, but that is not what this rather dreary film is about. It is about three adults who cannot stick to commitments, who are deeply self-indulgent, and who, if they exercised some self-restraint, would be far better parents. They all show signs of it at times; there is clearly some love and some wisdom buried in these three characters, but it is thrown aside over and over. I could barely finish the film, and at the end thought, ""Yes, the kids are all right, but they might have been a good deal more all right if the adults in their lvies acted like adults."
3,It's not a comedy,"I would say that this is more a story about marriage/relationships. The context of the partners being gay was different, but as for the deeper message "" marriage is a marathon"" that holds true despite the type of marriage.There were not really any big funny haha moments , except when Julian Moore (Jules) described herself as a ""sad sad middle aged lesbian "". Part of the humor being that it is hard to think of Julian Moore as a sad sad anything.Annette Bening so far has gotten the awards but Julian Moore's performance was no slouch.The actors who played the kids did a good job also.But this is not a comedy."
2,Hmmm...,"Still leaves me wondering what the point was? I mean on the surface it was mice to see a family go through family problems as a married lesbian couple. However,throwing in the biological father would have been enough on its own, the affair, another obstacle, but the twist felt forced and upset the balance of the film, which then took focus off of the ""kids being alright""."
4,Acting is really good,Two of my favorite female adult actors star in this film about a lesbian marriage coping with children curious about their biological father. These ladies really step outside their normal roles and do quite well. Mark Ruffalo (the father) also is very believable as the free spirt father with just enough direction in his life to take him seriously.
1,Great acting for Bening,"No one can fault the acting in this film. I generally like Annette Bening in her roles until this one. She is mentally, emotionally and physically repulsive. Her character is so vile as to cause actual nausea. The children are spoiled brats, and the spouse (moore) is spineless. This is just a lame story about a weak minded individual. So terrified she is of losing anyone due to her lack of substance, she is a tyranical hun. Don't waste your time."
1,Vastly Overrated,"So a movie is good if the male character is treated like garbage, I suppose... this review contains spoilers. At the end, Mark Ruffalo's character is referred to as an interloper by Annette Bening's character. He was not the one who interfered with anyone else's life, though. They interfered with his life by seeking him out and getting in touch with him. The message also seems to be that heterosexual sex is evil (because it involves a male) and lesbian sex is the purest, most saintly sex possible. Would the people who like this movie be happy if all the men in the world just killed themselves right now? Would that satisfy them?"
2,I wanted to like it.,"I hated this movie, but not because of the subject matter, rather I hated the acting by the Hollywood superstars (so predictable, not genuine or believable at all) and I really hated the disrespectful way the topic of same sex marriage/relationships was handled. It was so cliche' and felt very disrespectful. The material was there, but the director and the actors flubbed it. My favorite part of this movie was the development of the relationship between father and daughter. That felt real and authentic and likely, although I find it hard to believe that a guy who was so seemingly immature could be such a successful entrepreneur in today's volatile consumer market. I was also not thrilled with all the gratuitous sex that seemed to be thrown in just to hold our attention when the acting couldn't. Such a disappointment!!!"
2,"hopeful, but disappointed","I was hopeful, yet disappointed in the plot line and complete dismissal of Mark Ruffalo's character in the end. Film had strong character development, a great cast, and was well acted~ the kids were very strong(*****). Hope to see them in future films."
3,Don't Judge Me By This,"The kids are definitely all right. But the story is just a little off as far as lesbian love is being played out. That is whyBoys on the Sidewill always be top 5 on my list of lesbian love films. When did they become a regular family with all the inequalities of the male-female rules? I understand nobody has got this life thing figured out but love can be in any form and diffirent for anyone. It does not have to be the same pattern for everyone especially marriage which at the current time is the ""ultimate"" expression of LOVE.The film as an art form is very enjoyable in terms of acting and cinematography. I most definitely love the outdoor shots and scenes. I would urge people to see this for Julianne Moore."
2,Bad Ending!,"Mark Ruffalo played a great character in this movie, and I was disappointed that he was blamed for everything and chased away at the end of the story."
1,"WARNING: UNFUNNY, TOO-'CLEVER', HEART-RENDING","One-star due to false labeling this film ""funny/smart/heart-warming"" when it is truly ""unfunny/too-'clever'/heart-rending"" True, the acting is superb and the writing feels spot-on at many points. But the plot is soooooooo contrived and the characters are so distorted so as to overshadow the acting and writing. From my perspective, one can view this film as 'funny' and 'heart-warming' only in a sick/bad/shallow way. Because the truth of the film is otherwise to experience this film as gross/inauthentic/mean-spirited. Earns one-star because zero is not an option and because Bening and Moore soldier through with great performances."
1,Over rated!,"This appears to be another movie people over rate the movie because of the subject matter. Good actors but I was very disappointed in the movie. It reminds me of the movie Piano, everyone raved about it so I watched it. That was 2 hours of my life I will never get back!"
2,Not good,I did not care for the movie. I don't like sex scenes. I think they are unnecessary to tell the story. I like Julianne Moore. There are lesbian scenes in case someone is squeamish. The story of the kids finding their sperm donor is very good twist.
2,If you like California speak...,"It's not the subject matter I object to, it's the script -- I mean, cool, man -- if you like scripts with the vocabulary limited to like, yeah, cool, and more of that ""ilk"" -- enjoy. otherwise --"
1,Eww!,"I only watched about a third of this film. The story may have been good, but the graphic sexual content turned my stomach. Sorry, I don't need those kind of scenes to understand the story."
4,Respirator is fine - but the package arrived taped?,"I purchased this respirator from Amazon due to the dramatic price difference from the brick and mortar store. The respirator is fine, but the blown plastic container it arrived in was taped with clear packing tape on each side. Did anyone else receive a respirator packaged like that? It also appeared very slightly dirty - though it was hard to tell. The tape was what was most concerning. I called the manufacturer and they stated that they do not tape the packages, and that I should send it back as it might have been used. If Amazon is taping these closed it is an extremely poor idea as it makes the package appear that it has been opened. Who wants to chance using a respirator meant for toxic dust like asbestos, organics like hantavirus, etc, that may have been used? Now I'm reluctant to order another one as I'm worried it might come taped too (if Amazon is doing it) - and then I won't know if it has been opened."
5,good product,"I have bad allergies and needed something when i was removing carpet. I could see all the dust coming out of the carpet when i was removing them, normally i would be sneezing up a storm, but with this i didn't sneeze once. Wish i discovered this item sooner."
1,Melts on your face,"It works well as a respirator but the blue rubber part leaves a tacky material on your face,It feels like silicon on your face.I washed it several times but it continued to happen.I stopped using it because it felt gross on my face and I bought a unit from North that doesn't melt on your face.I kept it in my truck for an emergency and it turned to a gel,I had to throw it out."
3,MSA respirator,"This inexpensive respirator will serve the purpose. Quality is not too good, filmy straps is not made to last. I think my old AO brand will last more then twice long. If you need to use it often, get something better made."
4,It worked for acid staining concrete,I was glad I purchased this. It was comfortable and effective. The price for a similiar product at local hardware stores was about $50.
4,Comfortable and effective respirator,Used while spray-sealing our fence on a warm day. Was quite comfortable and I couldn't smell any fumes. Did not get overly warm while wearing it and breathing was easy. Huge improvement over the paper-type masks.
1,Broke after a few months of use,"Product worked well for me for awhile. I actually really liked using it.After a few months of general usage, the mask piece itself broke on me. One of the plastic clips which attached the straps to the mask snapped became unusable. I might have received a defective item, based on the other reviews for this product. But overall I am very dissatisfied with the quality of this piece of safety equipment. I'm probably going to buy another mask unit, but not from MSA.-Valkyrie"
4,Awesome product,"This is an awesome product, but as with any heavy-duty respirator one ends up sounding like Darth Vader while trying to breath through one. Nevertheless, this is highly recommended for any demolition job (especially lath and plaster), drywall sanding et cetera."
5,Oregon chain,Excellent product that truly holds its edge. Will certainly purchase again and recommend to anyone that has to take a tree apart!
1,BEWARE,"Appears to be the correct hair gel, HOWEVER, hair gel is strongly discolored. I suspect it has been sitting there for years... Did not look safe to use. Returned it and got refund... but did lose out 10 dollars for shipping...beware."
1,"Defective product, ZERO stars.",Product was grossly discolored and consistency was like water instead of a thick gel. Do not buy this. Wish I had seen previous review before placing my order.
1,"Disappointing movie, hard to open DVD.","I guess I dislike films about pimps, drugs and child abuse. Nothing like advertised as ""Spectacular! Excellent!"" that is printed on the DVD cover. Unimpressive and not of a high artistic quality. I would only recommend it to kill time, if you have lots of it, as you will be spending 15 minutes trying to remove the DVD and then almost 2 hours watching this mediocre movie. So, to open the DVD I had to destroy the entire packaging down to removal of the cover. It was sealed in two layers of plastic and to remove the THREE (3) security device warning stickers I had to completely destroy and remove the hard plastic that holds the colourful (yes, it's the correct spelling) ""booklet sheet"" with picture and info."
5,Brilliant!,It is a tear jerker and a film everyone should watch at least once. A very powerful message. Walk away happy knowing the director adopted one of the homeless boys in real life and brought him up in the United States.
4,Tracks,Tracks1. Follow The Rules (Radio Mix) 3:062. Follow The Rules (Original Mix) 3:513. Follow The Rules (Transatlantic Club Mix) 9:364. Follow The Rules (Extended Under Mix) 5:475. Follow The Rules (Do The Right Mix) 5:336. Follow The Rules (Light Piano Mix) 3:15
4,"Cool ""in-between"" album outing!","Okay, this is the review of the single (w/ B-ides), not the mix of ""Home & Dry."" The first track, ""Home & Dry"" reminds me of Electronic (probably because Johhny Marr's [from The Smiths], involved). Great vocal delivery on Neil Tennan't part. The b-sides are cool too - ""Sexy Northerner"" has a cool hook, ""Its not all... Football ....!"" Hilarious & oh so Pet Shop Boys. The last track is ""Always,"" kinda sounds like Pet Shop circa their first album ""Please"", which is a good thing. ""Always"" reminds me of an Erasure track, 'cause Neil's voice is ""processed"" sounding.Check it out, the PSB website makes it sound like it is NOT being released in US. See the review for CD #2 too."
4,Blues Project First Album,"As a kid in jr high/high school, I bought this record when it first came out. I love having the expanded version, with improved sound, available after some 4+ decades. Born in an era of wider spread exposure of traditional blues to a young white audience, the Blues Project could play the blues definitively (""Alberta""), but also brought folk and rock influences (and later, on ""Flute Thing,"" jazz) to the table. I was afraid it would be just a nostalgia trip to hear this after so many years, but it remains enjoyable and fresh."
5,Definately a Great Collection,"There are really only a couple great rocksteady cds out there, and this is one of them. The thing that probably makes it stick out is the fact that it is all from one producer. Duke Reid had great style and quota of excellence that creates a real sense of consistency during the whole listen. A great collection of hits from a short, but improtnat time in jamaican music history"
5,Buried Gem,"It doesn't get much better than this. This is a moment in time (c. '64-'66) captured forever. All fans of reggae, rock steady, ska, lounge, heck - MUSIC!, should give this a listen. It deserves a place in your collection."
3,"Useful, but not ""Ultimate.""","I was looking for a step-by-step method for training a young horse, and this isn't it. Mr. Wilhelm describes his round pen or leadline methods for starting and stopping the horse's feet, and then suddenly we are in the saddle teaching the horse to give to the bit, with no explanation of how we got up there!My dream horse might automatically understand about carrying a saddle and having a rider on board without being systematically taught about those things, but I sure don't want to count on it.There's a lot of useful information in this book, I'm not going to toss it out, but I'll need to look elsewhere for a system of foundation training."
3,Norwegien survival epic,"Jan Baalsrud was the only survivor of a botched sabotoge mission in Norway during the Second World War. His almost unbelievable story of escape and survival is recounted here. Jan's story is amazing and a tribute to the many Norwegians who risked their own lives to assist him. I debated between a 3-star and a 4-star rating here and settled on the 3-star due mainly to the fact that the mission itself was a complete failure, betrayed at the start, and because the ending is somewhat anti-climactic."
3,Truly a Man's book about survival,"We Die Alone is the first book I've ever read that in my opinion is a man's read . It states it is about World War 2, but it could have been a story of survival anywhere, as the war plays a very small, but important part of the story's reasonings. I enjoyed it, and I didn't think I would. The book lacks the emotional quality of most of the books I've read. It deals with surviving . . . pure and simply. It's pace is slow, but it doesn't drag. It welcomes you into what living through tragedy after tragedy must be like and you can't stop until you know whether he makes it or not. A great read . . . no, but a very good read . . . YES."
5,We Die Alone:A WWII Epic of Escape and Endurance,Unbelievable story and very interesting. Man's will to live is certainly evident. One is left wondering how the man in the story does what he does and with every page you are anxious to see what he has to endure next and how he does it.
4,Interesting but choppy.,"The story in this book is fascinating because it is true. However, the multitude of errors make it seem choppy and difficult to read--don't know if it is because it is Kindle edition or not. If you like true stories of survival and rebellion against the Nazis in WWII, you will like it despite the grammatical and typographical errors."
4,"Great, exciting read","It is absolutely amazing the things this guy went thru. You wouldn't believe it, if it wasn't a true story. Interesting,educational, and enjoyable read."
4,Great read,I thought this was a great read. At first I was not sure if it was a True story because it was not at the center of the war. It was. I recommend this for any history buff
3,Interesting,The book was interesting as it told something about Norway during the war. It struck me as a short story that had been padded to qualify as a book.
4,"exciting read,amazing tenacity",this book is a remarkable and universal story that should be read and told. enjoyed it from beginning to end. the heroes were average folks doing great things.
5,We Die Alone,The book was received before the scheduled delivery date. The condition of the paperback was like new which was better than described in the offering. This was truly an amazing value even with the shipping added in.
5,A PAGE-TURNER!,"This is an excellent, suspensful read. But an even better edge-of-your-seat page-turner is Dorit Whiteman's recent book, Escape Via Siberia, which also tells an against-all-odds WW II survival story but provides richer historical context."
5,AMAZING STORY,"Just when you think your life is tough, read this book and realize what tough is! Great story and unbelieveable endurance."
4,Good read,"Good of used a bit more detail and background on the mission, who set it up, the operators, the command, etc. As far as the narrative on Jans story of survival goes it was a page turner, didn't take long to get to the end of this one. Enjoyed it very much"
4,The Endurance of One Man,"I thought the book was well written and highlights the severe challenges that one man faced in his attempt to evade his German enemy in the harsh environment of northern Norway. The author also shows the great risk that Norwegian families faced as they assisted and harbored a fellow Norwegian who was willing to fight against the Nazi forces that had invaded their country. Evasion, bitter cold conditions, and the sheer will to survive alone for many weeks shows the level of endurance and strength that Jan Baalsrud demonstrated throughout his ordeal. It is a true story of a man who refused to capitulate to the enemies he faced, both the military and the climatic conditions on the northern frontier of Norway during World War II."
3,Decent read but not an epic one,"I enjoyed the story but it did take me longer to finish than I would have wanted. The local citizens who helped him were the real heros. He just sort of went along for the ride. The locals left him up in the mountains a few times by himself without the ability to move. They basically left him to die and by shear chance he didn't. After a while they felt so bad for him they came to the conclusion that he had suffered enough and at that point risked their lives to get him over the mountain range, out of enemy territory, and into the hands of the allies. He lived to tell the tale but I'm not overly impressed with his actions."
4,An excellent recount of an historic adventure,"If it was fiction, it would be unbelievable - but it's actually a true story of a soldier's courageous, desperate, brave and ultimately vulnerable and dependent situation in Norway during WWII. Amazing what some people will risk to save another! Amazing what the will can sustain the body to endure. Highly recommend."
2,I'm tempted to stop at page 75,"This was so highly recommended by many as a good read after ""Unbroken."" I guess I'm unfortunate in that I read ""Horse Soldiers"" first and now find this book uninspiring and lackluster. But I'll trudge on and maybe edit this review if and when I finish the book. Hey... (June 8, 2011) just came across this book and review....I don't think I finished the book...forgettable..."
3,Dont Read the Narrative,I was about to buy this book until the narrative description gave the story away! Seriously. Why tell the ending of the story for this type of book?
2,"Interesting story, uninspired writing","The story is interesting, but the writing does not capture. It is hard for an author who did not live through a hell to convey it as well or emotionally as the person who did. The result here is more a dispassionate academic read rather than an exciting adventure story. With a stack of new books awaiting, I gave up on this one after about 100 pages."
1,Awkward to read,"This book is a tale of survival and not a novel, therefore it is written in a different style. However the style in which it is written is almost unbearable. So many sentences are so grammatically awkward that it just takes away from the story that is being told. Aside from that there are also a number of typos, which again detract from the story. Those two factors makes for an unpleasant read. Great story of survival, but the fact that it reads like it was written by a 5th grader leaves it with only 1 star."
2,we die alone,"i have read the book but was not happy just because is almost the same as the book ( AS FAR AS MY FEET CAN CARRY ME).some pages were exactly the same , word by word.it look like it was a copy of the other book( as far as my feet can carry me)i was very sorry that i bought the book and lost interest very fast."
3,It was okay.,"Good book, but not what i expected. Comparing to the controversial and riveting account of Slavomir Rawicz -The long walk, i found this story somewhat pale in comparison. Although proven true (However i doubted some accounts) it just didn't satisfy my expectations. But that's not the say i didn't enjoy the book, i did, just not as much as i first thought."
3,Murphys Law,"An interesting tale of a guy trying to fight the Nazi's but fails. On a covert mission to Norway, it seems that everything that could go wrong, did go wrong. If you want a tale of how things could and did go wrong for people (soldiers and civilians) in WWII, this is a good story."
4,"Incredible true WWII survival tale, rippingly told.","One winter, in the midst of WWII, a crew of expatriate Norwegians attempted to land a cargo of guerilla supplies on Nazi-occupied Norway's far-northern coast. This book tells the story of the incredible privation endured by one of those men, Jan Balsruud, his hardihood and survival, and the risks and sacrifices undertaken on his behalf by the men and women who help him evade capture.I first read _We_Die_Alone_ some thirty years ago, in the first paperback edition, and I know that certain of its scenes and events will stay with me so long as I live. Howarth recounts the story simply, and lets the facts provide the drama.Strongly recommended."
4,The will to live.,An incredible story of survival that is well told. After chapters of detail about solitude and survival in the mountains it seemed to end a little prematurly. It would have been nice to know how the Lapps out ran the German patrol and hooked up with the Swedes.
3,"Good story, marred by inaccuracies","This is an amazing story of determination and survival against impossible odds. The book does a good job of describing the basic story, but the author unfortunately muddles some events and provides an extremely racist and inaccurate portrayal of the Sami people. For a more accurate description of the same events, I would recommend Defiant Courage: A WWII Epic of Escape and Endurance by Astrid Karlsen Scott and Tore Haug.Defiant Courage: A WWII Epic of Escape and Endurance"
5,We Die Along,Stephen Ambrose writes in the foreword that this is one of about 6 books he can think of which he could not put down. I have to agree. It rates right up there with The Long Walk and Unbroken for unbelieveable survival against all odds. You will not regret purchasing this book.
1,Nice Voice,I feel that traditional music has been excluded and that the pure message of the gospel has been diluted way too much. This does not take away from the talent of this artist but I think that my comments will give the readers something to think about.
3,"Strong, vibrant voice but can be crude at times",Another vocalist I had not heard much of until my mother (of all people) told me that she liked Peggy's music. I purchased the CD for her and got a chance to hear some of the songs. Not my type of music. Peggy has a good voice that can touch the heart but some of her songs are somewhat disjointed without a smooth lyric flow.
5,Silence is Golden,This book sells itself as it has a great deal of spiritual wisdom by many religious leaders from Guru to Swami and Rabbi. Not only is the book a quick read for anyone looking for a quick pick me up throughout the day. I keep it in my purse so I can quickly reference during those tough times when you just need spiritual advice and Godly wisdom.
4,read this book!,A Traveler's Guide to Spacetime is a wonderful introduction to the realm of Special Relativity. Moore presents the material in interesting format combining imaginative scenarios of evil space cadets with intuitive yet complicated equations.
4,"historical reference, not an art/photography book","Just one quick note - despite being categorized by Amazon as ""art/photography,"" this book is more of a historical reference work. There are 10-15 pages of castle photographs in the middle, but the vast majority of the book is text. (I was looking for books of castle pictures to inspire elementary school students, and this is the wrong book for such a thing.)"
5,Mr. Richard Rocks!,"In my opinion, this cd is great - and you must own a copy of it! Mr. Richard is a very talented musician - his music is original and catchy! What I love most about his music is that I enjoy it too! My son loves Long Island Railroad Blues and Sammy Snake! Get ready to rock by getting your copy now!"
1,get a grip!!!!!!!,"this album is truly jim staffords best effort but here i sit looking at the price of 49.95 for it and its a cd-r!!!!! man whoever you are you really need to get yourself together,get mental help because if you think thats a fair and decent price you need it severely!"
5,JIM STAFFORD,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND! WHO LOVES JIM STAFFORD MUSIC!THE CD WAS IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE AND WE GOT THE MUSIC IN 3 OR 4 DAYS!
4,Great old Memories,"It wasn't recorded as I remember as far as the sound quality but so much fun to have , he ytoo, was a great storyteller.Clean songs."
2,"Wrong cover, cost too high","The book was sold at 3x the value. It was not the same cover or size as the one advertized and Amazon was supposed to credit me the difference, which they did not. Now I have a gift certificate that will take me years to use, since I almost never buy anything on Amazon. Geez, I wonder why?"
3,Who paid this guy?,"While there is good info to be had, this guy is a shill for selling specific products: the steel guitar he uses, the amp, the pedal... It's like going to a movie and being subjected to all those on screen advertisements before the movie begins. Not cool."
4,Funny & Nostalgic,"I didn't want to put this book down! I appreciate the nostalgia found in Mr. Ivory's descriptive childhood stories. Each about his mother and friends were particularly endearing.I expected his adult romantic recollections to be graphic, but was pleased that he was able to convey his memories without the use of totally explicit language. At times, however, I needed to skim a paragraph to avoid feeling uncomfortable. I recommend this book for it's humor and good-natured stories, but would discourage anyone offended by occasional explicit language."
3,Already Done Better,"Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book more had I not read another similar, more comprehensive, and better book just a few months ago. If you like this book, or if you are considering this book, I strongly recommend you take a look at Them, by Jon Ronson in addition/instead. It's much better and covers a wider variety of extremists."
4,Fascinating insight in the mind of a documentarist,"In this book, written as a kind of 'expiation' for the sin of 'using' his 'subjects', Louis Theroux goes back to the scene of the crime - to find out what became of the peculiar people he met years before.The real appeal, though, is that it shines a pale light on what the author was really thinking while filming the series, beyond the goofy, naive enthusiasm which has come to be the trademark of his screen persona.If you enjoyed the Weird Weekends series, you will appreciate this short book."
5,Gotta Love Louis,"This is a great follow-up to Louis Theroux's Weird Weekends show. If you've never heard of him, I highly recommend watching all of his videos. He is funny, informative and a little goofy. A perfect combination for dealing with the off-beat weirdness of the myriad of fringe groups wandering around the US."
4,Entertaining and easy,"An entertaining and easy read. Gives a bit more of an insight into Louis Theroux's personality, something which always seemed a bit difficult to judge in the TV show.Quite interesting to hear what had happened to some of the interviewees as well."
3,"not amazing, but entertaining","it keep me entertained in the subway. I need something to read every morning for my long commute. This book was easy to read, but I didn't find it fascinating."
2,Urgh!!,"Another useless webpage design crap. As in my other website design review, go with Sitespinner."
3,The pictures make it look younger than it actually is....,"I bought this for my second-grader because she had to do a report ona famous American. The pictures were great, but it had a lot of informationin it that she wasn't familiar with yet such as ""Quakers"", ""Colonists"", etc.I was looking for a very elementary intro to Betsy Ross, but this wasa little too old for her. I read it to her, but since she hasn't studiedthe revolution, colonial America, etc. it was over her head and she thoughtit was boring. The pictures are great and it would be perfect for a child inat least third grade....or any child who understands a little about the foundingof our country."
5,Good book for classroom lesson,"This is a kid-friendly book for introducing the life and contributions of Betsy Ross. It is written as an easy-to-understand story, and the illustrations and interesting facts really grab children's attention. I would highly recommend this book for any grade level."
3,Price is set too high,"Quality is good, although I'm watching just on my Kindle Fire, so the screen is much smaller than a regular televsion. I do think the price should be lowered since there is no packaging fees. With iTunes albums are often cheaper than when bought in a regular store. I think digital copies of movies through Amazon should be the same."
4,Not a bad product,I have only had the opportunity to use this product a couple of times since I have purchased so the best I can say is so far so good. I have had no issues this far. I have glasses so the main thing I was looking for in this product was something I could wear that fits comfortably down over my glasses and thus far no problems. I would feel ok if suggesting this to others. I would think you would be happy for the most part.
3,Without WD-40 it took two hands & 30 sec to move the shield.,"Without WD-40 it took two hands & 30 sec to move the shield.I was ready to send it back until I thought ... Let's give it one more chance with WD-40.I honestly thought it was going to rip or break something using two hands with the helmet in my lap trying to re-position the face shield.But believe it or not it is NOW THE PERFECT TENSION.Not too loose and not too tight.I also purchased the other shield here at amazon from 3M company.AO Safety 90028 Professional FaceshieldI like it better, BUT, this one has a better adjust for size of the head.So if different people may be using this face shield go with this one.If only you will be using the face shield go with the one from 3M (about $1 more)"
3,its ok,i bought this for a dexter costume for comic con and what can i say its a facesheild plastic is kind of thin and kind of bows out oddly and its grey not black on the top but for the price it works
1,Too Cheap! A Waste of Time and Money.,"As others have commented, the construction quality of this mask is so cheap it's unusable so we're returning it. Even though it hasn't even been used the ""padded"" headpiece is already coming apart and, as far as the flip-up mechanism goes, it doesn't. Spend a few bucks more."
1,4 Stars (not 1 star): Pretty Good Once I got the Blue Film Off,At first I was surprised to find that the face shield was almost completely opaque. It turns out that there is a blue film on the scren that is very difficult to remove (it would've been nice if the package said something about this film). I've now been using this for a couple weeks and it is pretty comfortable and effective. It's even fairly comfortable when using it in combination with safety goggles.
4,MSA Faceshield,"I've used a lot of MSA safety equipment over the last 30 years and have a high degree of confidence in the their products. They still make the most comfortable hardhat I've ever worn.This faceshield is no different. It's simple to use, the shield is easy to replace, and it's comfortable. The head adjustment and shield tilt mechanism are a little stiff, but those are non-issues for me.There's not a good way to use normal earmuff hearing protection with this particular design or I would have given it five stars. All that really means is I have to use the earmuffs that have a band running around the back of the head or use ear plugs.In a nutshell ""Good product. Good price."""
2,Cheap product,I wanted an inexpensive faceshield but this one was too cheap and did not adjust small enough for my head. It was quite uncomfortable and not worth even $15.
1,item unlike description,The item color is green not black like I needed and expected. It is not easy to see through the shield it looks very foggy and blurry. Seller mislead me with pictures and an invalid description..would never do business again.
3,Not bad. Not good. Just average.,"I bought this and a tinted cover to use for oxy-acetylene welding. The cover I bought was a universal fitting shield but it didn't quite fit this head piece. I had to cut out two holes in the shield to make it fit. It was easy to do but it shouldn't be needed.Also the hinge parts that allow you to raise and lower the shield are too stiff. You have to tighten the head straps a lot to keep it on your head. It's not completely stiff because there is a down position and an up position and it kind of locks into those spots, but it's still too stiff on the initial flip up or down. Hopefully it'll loosen with time."
4,Good for the price,"This item has a good quality/price ratio, however don't expect the moon: it gets the job done but it's not very comfortable/good looking/sturdy.If you don't plan to use it all that much it's a good purchase, go for it.If you will use it extensively I'd recommend a better model.I personally have a 10+ acre lot that needs clearing and I use it with my weed-whacker (string replaced with blades). The faceshield has successfully stopped quite a few rocks/pieces of wood from hitting my face and the shield did not get damaged, however it's not particularly comfortable. I'll probably buy a nicer model if I need to replace it."
2,"OK, but.....",The mask is fine and has done its job while I turn wood. It is difficult to put together and the headband is very hard to keep in place. Harbor Freight has better deals.
2,Very Disappointed,I have yet to figure out how to open up the band so that I can actually put it on my head. The color of the plastic is also confusing. I would not recommend this to anyone.
4,Works Great,I recently used this while sharpening two tractor blades. It was comfortable and I did not have any problems seeing. I plan to use it next when I trim my lawn with my Echo gas trimmer.
4,This Faceshield Is Worth The Price,Read the reviews of several different faceshields and this one got good reviews from many. You can now count me in with the same opinion. I bought two to not only have a spare but to have one always handy. Keep one for when I'm using my gas powered trimmer which always peppered my face with debris - safety glasses was not enough protection. And the second one in the shop and again it is better than just safety glasses. Four star rating is for overall quality - I'm sure there are better made ones for more money but this one is well worth the price unless using one all day is needed for your profession.
5,Time to replace your old face mask,"Well made, totally effective. In my experience, masks tend to get dirty, fogged, or scratched pretty quickly. I wish I had replaced mine a long time ago. This product is so inexpensive. I don't like to throw out old tools. Seems ""wasteful."" But in this case it's an important decision.Note that it takes a minute to assemble, meaning snap the face shield into the headpiece. The face shield comes with a nice protective covering, which is easy to remove but keeps it perfect during shipping.The head-size adjustment on the back is fast to use, which means that other people can easily borrow my mask -- important to keep your visitors safe, too."
4,Nice and clear,"Bought these glasses for night cycling. They are a little on the large size, but they're clear, don't look too dorky, and make the perfect night-ride shields. The wife won't wear the pair I got her, so now I have an extra set."
3,"Good Fit and coverage, anti-fog not so much","I use these for biking at night during winters to protect my eyes from cold air and from watering incessantly. They fit well even on my big-ish face and the lenses cover your eyes real well to prevent wind from entering. My only gripe with this product is that it claims to be anti-fog but that is absolutely not the case. Today I went on a ride and these glasses fogged so much that they almost caused me to crash by going on a nasty pot hole that was completely blurred because of these glasses.At this price I guess you get what you pay for. And this solves a purpose for the most part but the day there is slight bit more humidity in the air, then please be careful using these. You'd be better off riding without these and save yourself from being in an accident."
2,"Comfortable, but poor quality","I was initially impressed with these glasses, as they were very comfortable both over the ears and on the bridge of my nose. The pivoting temples made it easier to adjust how they sat on my face and get the best fit. I work building and repairing composite wind turbine blades, and needed wrap around protection that could be comfortably worn all day long. The first day, was impressed......and also threw them away. The lenses scratched so easily that they were difficult to see out of after cleaning only twice. I was extremely disappointed in how easily the lenses scratched, and will not buy anything from MSA again."
4,decent product,"I use these for bicycling. They have a nice large lens area for maximum protection.Fairly comfortable. I prefer another pair I bought from Ducks Unlimited however, whichare lighter, although they have slightly smaller lens. It's a tradeoff."
2,blurry,"My eyes may be more sensitive than some, but these glasses blur my vision and make me dizzy after extended wear."
5,GREAT PERFUME,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR CHRISTMAS GREAT PRICE. LOVE THE SMELLITS A GREAT PRODUCT . I LOVE CALVIN KLEINS PRODUCTS
5,Lovely Fragrance,"This is a timeless fresh fragrance. The eau de parfum is great because it is long lasting. Fantastic price on Amazon, so would recommend."
1,Wrong Perfume,"I got the wrong perfume and there was no way I could return it, so I struck out with my girlfriend."
1,stop asking me to rate this product,do not ask me again if you dont stop your incessant requests for my rating this product i will close my account
4,Love Eternity Perfume,"Received my perfume on time and very well packaged. Price is good and also the perfume. Would buy from this seller again. I would recommend this fragrance. I use it everyday for work and I always received complements on it (no word of a lie) and ask me what perfume I'm wearing, that's how good this perfume is. I love it. I won't wait to finish the bottle I'll order again before that happen.Thank you for such of great fragrance (perfume)."
5,"Excellent price, Fast shipping and Great price",Added this to my collection and it's one of my favourites. I also have eternity summer and eternity moment as well. Highly recommend this one if you're looking for a long lasting scent.
5,Fragrances,"You can't go wrong with Eternity fragrances - from women's perfume to men's products, they're as good as it gets."
5,Eternity Spray,"This was an awesome deal, I just love Eternity, it's refreshing and light. I get a lot of complements when I wear it! The company that I bought it from was fabulous, great communication and fast."
2,"Pleasant, but doesn't reach any great heights.","It seems that anyone who has lived abroad, (especially if the abode was in Tuscany or the South of France), feels compelled to write about it. This book makes for a pleasant read, but is somewhat predictable in its adherence to that genre of travel/living abroad school of writing. I found the book had some useful and amusing facts, but a lot of the in-depth encounters with other Romans added nothing to my interest in that city. Although a British visitor, without the length of experience of the now-expatriate Romagnoli, H.V.Morton's ""A Traveler in Rome"" remains the incomparable choice for a deeper understanding of Rome."
4,Soothing for a sinus ache,This is an excellent product! Two minutes in the mircowave and I'm on my way to relief. The Original Bed Buddy is still better. This product would be better if it had an elastic band/
1,useless,"doesn't matter how long you leave this in the freezer, it doesn't even get cool. have not tried to heat because I bought it as a cold pack. for me, a big waste of money."
1,Amazon -- MP3 tracks missing -- different album,"Chet 5 stars -- Red Cab Records 1.The first 10 tracks are from ""Chet Baker with 50 Italian Strings"" [in a different sequence]. Then 4 tracks from side 1 of ""Chet Baker in Milan"". Amazon, please include side 2 with this listing -- so we can buy the complete and correct album. Oh, and the genre is not Latin Music."
4,Best Autobiography by a Bridge Player,"This is in my opinion the best autobiography written by a Bridge player. Hamman brings you into the world of how the best Bridge player of our era thinks and plays. There are many fascinating stories about the big personalities during the ""golden era"" of Bridge and his account of the famous Italian Blue Team rivalry is worth the read alone."
2,Hard to close,This jack in the box is extremely difficult to push back in and close the top. I could hardly do it nevermind my 2 year old. I don't recommend this toy at all.
2,Jack in the box,"Bought this Jack in the box for my grandson, and he is too little to do much to it, yet the music is already broken & will not play. We have already thrown away the packaging, so I am sure without it, unable to return or exchange. Looks nice, but the durability, even for a child that barely is able to use it yet, very disappointed."
4,toddler fun,"This is a great toy for a 2-3 year old, maybe older. I bought it a while ago and my grandson still gets a good laugh when the clown pops up."
3,It broke once my daughter got the hang of it,"I bought this toy when my daughter was less than a year old (so we've had it a little over a year now). And now that she's almost two years old, she is able to turn the handle properly to operate the jack in the box and the music won't play anymore."
3,"Not enough ""pop""","I got this jack in the box for my infant son because he loves to be surprised, and his favorite game is peek-a-boo so I thought he would love this toy. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Maybe jack just needs to be broken-in a little more, but I have been disappointed with the slow, ambling way jack pops out of his box. My son is not interested at all in this ""lazy"" jack, and I'm guessing its due to jack's inability to pop quickly out of the box. Otherwise it looks like a well-made toy, so I am going to give it a bit more time....."
4,really cute,"I brought it for my friend's daughter for her 1st b-day. I tried to play with it before giving it to her, and I really like it. I'm planning to buy another one for my baby."
4,"A Kinder, Gentler Jack-In-The-Box for the 21st century","It does not ""pop"" with the explosive violence and loud noise that I remember from my childhood. Not as startling, and therefore perhaps not as fun as the Jacks-In-The-Boxes from the 1970s. My children seem to find it only mildly amusing (but amusing, nonetheless)."
4,Purchased too soon,"This is an excellent product but I believe I purchased it too soon for my 12 mo old grandson. I believe it would have been better when he was around 3. He is now 18 months old and still unable to put it back in the box by himself, but he does try! He enjoys it popping out but I have to do it for him."
4,"My infant/toddler loves it. It died after 8 months, so I'll buy another...",My daughter loves this and was just learning to turn the crank on her own when the mechanism suddenly died!! She enjoyed it so much that we'll get another (but probably just one more...). Great for a 1-year-old.
3,Oldie but goodie,Gotta love the old jack in the box. The only problem is the clasp on the top wears after awhile and the jack will no longer pop up without assistance. Was a great toy when we first got it.
4,Essential reading for stupa builders,"This book is required reading for anyone seriously interested in building a stupa. It presents information on a number of topics usually not covered by other authors, like the order of the various preparations and rituals, the different lineages of stupa proportions and translations of a number of sutras and Tibetan texts on the contents of stupas and on stupa proportions. So as a reference book it's indispensable, despite the fact that it's literary style lacks fluency. As always with [semi-] scientific writings on anything Tibetan, the text is interspersed with Tibetan and Sanskrit phonetics which tend to become tiresome after a while. However, what matters is the presented information, which I find very useful. If you're just looking to deepen your understanding of the symbolism of stupas, or to learn about practices related to stupas, there are a number of better books out there."
3,For JLL fans: **** / Casuals: **,"You can't go wrong with JLL. I've yet to hear a bad studio track or a bad live track, but I've heard alot of subtandard sonics from the Ferriday Fireball and here is one of the main contenders for great music not recorded great. The syntax may be lousy, but baby, that is R & R.Excellent, animated performances, including the real ""I Got A Woman"", not Roy Orbison's improvisation entitled ""Mean Woman Blues"".We have some Memphis Flash commemorative tracks, ""I Got a Woman"", in that Lewis uses Elvis' striptease vamp to close it, ""Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"", a tune he enthused over back on Deember 4th, 1956, and the finale of this CD, ""Flip, Flop, And Fly""/""Shake, Rattle, And Roll"", to my knowledge an Elvis idea."
3,A Disappointmnet,"I am a big fan of the Carl Wilcox series and find them to be well written, interesting mysteries. In the case of ""The Ice Pick Artist"", I was diappointed. I found that the story went around in circles taking a great deal of time to arrive at the conclusion, which is odd for a relatively short book. Carl seems to be spinning his wheels and many of the characters are wooden. I guess it ""can't be Nashville every night""."
2,My first by this author.,"I'm not sure exacty what the author was trying to portray in this book. I didn't pick up on any particular train of thought where the protagonist, Carol Wilcox, was concerned. At one point, I almost lost track of the cast of characters, there were so many; and there didn't seem to be any real connection between this girl and Carl that would make him go traipsing all over the place trying to solve her murder. As for the murder storyline itself, it was somewhat adequate in keeping in line with the rest of the book. Nothing to write home about, that's for sure."
3,"Four stars for the movies, two stars for the prints","Three costume comedies with the Stooges. I'M A MONKEY'S UNCLE has the Stooges as cavemen in a typical slapstick outing. MUMMY'S DUMMIES has ""Honest Moe, Honest Shemp, and Larry"" as used-chariot salesmen in a funny spoof of sword-and-sandal epics. SQUAREHEADS OF THE ROUND TABLE is a clever comedy pitting Ye Stooges against The Black Prince; there's a memorable musical interlude with soprano Christine McIntyre and the Stooges. Columbia's video releases are technically fine as a rule, using 35mm theatrical masters, but not this time -- the tape is taken from darker-than-usual, 16mm TV prints! It's about the same quality as seen on some smaller labels, and it's watchable, but a few notches below Columbia's usual technical standard. Shemp deserves better."
4,Prehistoric Fun,"This is fun short, and it proves you don't need a lot of face slapping to be funny. I did a take off of this picture with 3 girls doing the Stooges parts with my best friend playing the Moe role. She was a little uncomfortable when we had to put a piece of string on her big toe (In the sleeping sequence Moe is catching breakfast with his big toe so she had to have her bare feet poking out of the fur blanket)It was hysterical as she nailed the part talking in her sleep about her boyfriend and all the girls snoring in tune blowing off the leaves of the tree. We had a lot of fun doing it."
5,Completely Satisfied,"Completely satisfied.I only have limited ports on my router, so my PS3 and Xbox 360 aren't able to be plugged in at the same time. Multiple colors are offered by this manufacturer so it's easy to color-code my components so that I know which one is plugged into the router.Also, the snag-free rubber guard over the plastic tab on the Ethernet connector is a nice touch. No risk of snapping off the plastic tab if it gets caught on carpet or other wiring. The guard is not stiff. It is easy to press down to release the plastic tab when changing Ethernet ports."
3,Great Look at an Early First Lady,"I had read that Dolley Madison is probably one of the most interesting, lesser known first ladies in our nation's history. This book definitly prooves that. Although there are a few inaccurate facts surrounding the Yellow Fever experience by Dolley's family in Philadelphia, Allegor seems like a trustworthy source on the topic. Hopefully she will release later editions in order to correct those inaccurate facts. It is also a shame there is not more information about her life before James Madison, with her first husband. But then again, that is not the main theme of this book. Recommended for both the amature and scholarly historian (I have a little of both in me)."
3,Nice CD.,"I purchased this CD hoping the entirity was similar to the some ""Movin' On"", but it is not. Although it is a nice CD, if you are hoping for many songs on it with this pace and lyrical style, make sure and listen to clips first. I was able to find about 3 songs on the CD that fit my taste, so I am sending it to someone I know who will like all of it. :)"
3,CD review,"This album was a bit more mellow than I expected, although there are several songs that have a faster beat."
5,a great book,this book is a must for folks that respect the basics of Basketball.and who better to show&tell than one of the Greatest players of All-Time in Walt Clyde'Frazier.he was a great defensive player&scorer.also he knows that Wilt Chamberlin was the Greatest Player ever.he breaks everything down.
3,likeably amateurish piano? Get real!,"I really like Cat Power, I do, I especially love her amazing, unique, emotional voice, but I could not stand this album for one reason...her piano accompaniment is unbearable on several tracks. Maybe 2 steps above your annoying nephew playing ""heart and soul"" over and over again. Maybe there's something new and avant-garde or something about her piano parts, but to me it just sounds terrible."
3,Cat Powers Covers,"There are one or two really good cuts, notably, Satisaction. The rest of the CD seems dreary and repetitive. She does have an amazing voice, however. I'd say, just buy the cuts you like."
5,Best way to do a cover,"This album is very intriguing to me because i have not heard any Cat Power that i really like. This album gives me hope for the artist. Each cover is done in a very simplistic way where the music sounds almost nothing like the original song (except ""Sea of Love bears a resemblance), and she even rearranges the lyrics and leaves parts out. This is very unique because most people do covers as close to the originals as possible, but that is boring in my opinion and all the listener does is compare it to the original, but these are unique to the original so it makes it its own song. The songs are all performed by just her and mostly are either piano or very simply guitar, but it gives it a real slow folky sound that in my mind is beautiful. I think the best song is ""Naked if i want to"" but i did buy the album becasue i heard ""I found a reason"", but there is not one bad track on the album. So check it out."
3,first Catpower CD purchase,"This is my first purchase of a Catpower CD. I choose this one given its good reviews. In general, I like the CD. It is extremely mellow and, overall, the songs sound nothing like the origials. I recommend listening to the song samples if you are unsure about purchasing the CD."
2,Another mostly lobotomized set,"2 1/2Another year, another ho-hum-drum offering from the nominally talented songwriter. As with most releases, the vast bulk bores away with monotonous instrumentation masquerading as minimalism, except this time we witness her interpretations of certain cover songs. When she holds back enough out of respect it often works best, but her choices are bland- Sea of Love almost works before it becomes tediously repetitious like most of 'em. One upside: the closest thing to Cat's puurfect song- an atypically self-less and fleshed out ""I Found A Reason""."
1,What a suck fest!,"I hate this cd, I mean I really abhor it. It really bothers me that some people think that this has any redeaming value. A person that just learned how to play guitar could create this.""The Greatest"" era Cat Power is okay because there's at least a little something there. Attitudinal Cat Power, like what this is, is terrible!When this came out she was this moody, pretentious, self-indulgent whiner. She would have anxieties at her concerts! I mean, c'mon, if you can't take the heat then just get out of the kitchen!These are ridiculous covers that neither resemble the originals nor is their an attempt to create something different. Their all in the same key, mopey, barely discernable lyrics and done at a slow, meandering pace.(I Can't get no) satisfaction is so bad, that there ought to be a law against such a thing"
4,Does this CD contain Cat Power's cover of He Was a Friend of Mine?,"I heard that Chan Marshall covers Bob Dylan's HE WAS A FRIEND OF MINE on this covers CD, but it is not listed on the tracklisting - does anyone know for sure if it's on this CD - or maybe a hidden track?"
5,My favorite of Cat Power so far!,"I may not be a proper Cat Power fan, because I find this album to be her best yet, but it is all her covering other people's tunes (except one track)...I got this yesterday and can't stop listening to it...It is by far her most melancholic album to date while also vocally her strongest. Her cover of Red Apples is amazing as is her take on the Stones and Velvet Underground...I HIGHLY recommend this cd to all Cat Power fans...it has totally captured me."
2,TOO MELLOW,"Chan Marshall has a great voice. Ok, but you have to use it wisely. This CD is so very soft and sad and mellow. Maybe a great CD if you are crying in your beer, but it seems dull and borrowing otherwise. Maybe one or two or three nice tracks. Try another Cat Power CD."
1,Not good at all.,"Honestly, I wanted to like these brownies, I did. But there is something in their taste that is so wrong, and off. Maybe it's because we all have different tastebuds but I really truly found them disgusting.Save yourself the $20 and avoid this brownie mix :("
2,Outrageous Price not so good Brownies,"We made these twice, the first time we thought maybe we made them incorrectly, but they came out the same the second time, very dry and crumbly, too sweet, and just not very good! There are many other brownie mixes on the market that happen to be less expensive and the taste and texture is really great.Pass on these. There were three boxes in this order we just threw the third box away."
4,Best brownie mix,"I followed the instructions and cooking time exactly, and the brownies came out perfectly! Even the corner pieces were moist and not over cooked. The brownies gave no hint of being from a mix and they were devoured at a party. They can't compare to Ina's scratch ""outrageous brownie"" recipe, but that's not surprising. I would definitely buy this mix again."
2,Watch the timing - overcooked in 35 minutes,"I think these brownies could have been good had they not burnt to a crisp in the 35 minutes suggested cooking time. I have a large, professional grade oven - so perhaps it cooks on the hot side - however these brownies were burnt burnt burnt. We managed to salvage a 2"" square out of the dead middle for a taste.... what we tasted, we liked. Will try another brand next time."
2,Do not plan on purchasing again.,"While I am fond of the Barefoot Contessa,I will not purchase this brownie mix again."
3,Not a true 13m,"I really like Tsubo products, but the sizes are not true . I wear a size 13m , the shoe fits more like a 12m."
1,Revlon Super Lustrous Lipstick,The lipstick is old and on the verge of being rancid. I'm very disappointed in the product and I wasted a lot of money since I bought four of them.
5,My favorite.,This is my go-to lipstick. The color works for me all year round. The formulation feels good on my lips -- not too dry and not too sticky.
3,it comes off...looking nasty,"Although the color is fantastic this lipstick does not stay on more than a few minutes. I have to reapply it too often, it rubs off on a coffee cup and glass (meaning ALL of it comes off, not just a little, and leaves the rim looking nasty)."
4,Excellent,"I wish the color was a bit deeper, but it is very moisturizing.I would recommend to others. I will order more later."
5,The perfect red,I was a little skeptical when I ordered it because the picture of the red lipstick did not look as bright as I wanted but I am so happy I decided to get it anyway because it is exactly what I wanted.
5,At last!,"I can't find this color in stores anymore so I was happy to find it here. It such a lovely, neutral berry with just a hint of glimmer. Not frosty at all, but just enough to give the color some depth. Is like my own lip color, but better!"
3,meh,"Its a really pretty color and its creamy so it doesn't dry out the lips, however i settles in lip lines, so I recommend exfoliating lips before you apply. Especially since the color isn't that subtle"
5,super!!,I can say that this lipstick leaves them soft. Also this colour looks great on every skin colour. Try it.
3,pretty but darker than pictured,A winter color as the shade is quite dark and not as pictured. Will use the shade with my darker clothing this winter.
1,metallic,"I thought this would be a very light, opaque shade of pink. But really, it has very little color but is loaded with silver shimmer. On me it looked very whitish and uneven."
1,USED LIPSTICK!!! - HOW DISGUSTING!!!,I ORDERED A LIPSTICK FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME FROM THIS COMPANY. I WAS VERY EXCITED TO RECEIVE MY PACKAGE SO QUICKLY ONLY TO BE EXTREMELY DISGUSTED AND DISAPPOINTED CAUSE MY LIPSTICK IS USED!!! I WILL TAKE PICTURES AND POST THEM ON HERE SO YOU CAN SEE HOW DISGUSTING THIS IS! WHOEVER USED IT AND SENT IT TO ME MUST HAVE THE MOST DRIEST AND UGLIEST LIPS EVER! YOU CAN SEE ALL THE LINES AND SMUDGES ON THE LIPSTICK!!! PLEASE SAVE YOUR 4 BUCKS AND GO SPEND A LITTLE MORE AT RITEAID CAUSE AT LEAST YOU'LL BE GETTING SOMETHING NEW AND YOU CAN ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY BACK IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE COLOR. WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN! I'M SO ANGRY BUT I'M NOT EVEN GONNA BOTHER CONTACTING THEM CAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.
3,Okay!,"I love Revlon's lustrous creme line. However, I am olive skinned tone; hence no pink lips. And although I dont have dark lips, this color didn't show well. It's not a bad product, just not the right color for those who're not fair skinned. Doesn't show on medium lips. Same with pearl lustrous pink."
5,My Beautiful Lipstick,I got the lipstick and I really like it because it is a nice dark color and I can use it to match anything.
5,Nice...,"Very pleased with this lipstick. Very creamy, and goes on smoothly. Doesn't darken up after applied, stays true to color. Would purchase again."
2,What a real SNOOZE this turned out to be.,"I saw this kid open up for Marc Broussard and blow him away. This kid came with a guitar and a drummer and showed up the headliner with his entire band.Great songs and the extended jams were amazing. That being said. This is a really well produced bore. Sure he's young, has a great voice and can play. I give him that. But this is a perfect example of the whole not being equal to the sum of the parts.I find this to be a cross between John Mayer and Howie Day. Both have better cd's than this.Maybe I was let down after seeing him live. I just have to say that there are far better cd's out there than this."
4,Best help for research in Britain and Europe,"I have had a subscription to this magazine since the first issue. It is BY FAR the best for help in research in Britain. It is published in the UK and so all articles are aimed at their home audience, but I have found lots of clues for websites, archives, etc. all over Europe. I would highly recommend this publication to anyone doing research in the UK!!"
4,Not a series but a good flick and a decent buy,"I enjoyed this dramatization of Hawking's early life. It is a bit hard to grasp, for me - a child of the 70's, what it was like before someone conceived of the Big Bang. This movie tried to paint that picture. Considering the time available and allotted they did a decent but not hugely impressive job. Apparently the prevailing theory before the Big Bang was Static Theory. The overthrow of Static Theory seemed much less ?sensational? than I expected it to be. Nevertheless, Hawking is brilliant; Cumberbatch is gifted (I easily forgot he was also Sherlock;) and Moffat is in good form as usual - though this is one of his more mundane topics.But as far as I can tell this is a movie or mini-series. It ends definitively so I don't see any more episodes being created.If you like this, you may also enjoy Einstein and Eddington, which I watched on the home box office."
5,Amazing!,"Amazing, amazing work from all the actors, very believable. The only issue I had was that it seemed too short, there was a lot more story they could have probably told."
2,Overkill,"Despite the rave reviews - I thought this book was an overkill. I do not recommend this book if your looking to understand ISO9000 from a simple perspective. If you'd prefer an explanation of ISO9000 from the perspective of ""At first there was light....."" then this is the book for you."
5,Simple is Powerful,"The essays in the book were intended for school girls, but can be powerful for anyone. The chapters are short but use clear explanations that provide much material for further meditations. Knox, who inspired both C.S. Lewis and Tolkin can take difficult concepts and make them live. I plan to read his other books."
4,Good frame,Looks nice and easy to use. True 11x14.Leaning it against the wall so not sure how well it hangs.
3,Sturdy frame,"It is a sturdy frame but it is overpriced. I think $10 is more reasonable. I could have found one similar to this if I had gone to Meijers, Wal-mart, etc.The back had pieces of cardboard stapled to it in the corners, which required some finesse to remove without damaging the frame, and I remain uncertain for the reason for those stapled miscellaneous pieces of cardboard. Anyway, it is a sturdy frame :)"
5,Good with Matching Matt Board for 20 x 200 Prints,"I got this (and the corresponding Matt Board) to frame a 20 x 200 print when I saw the exorbitant pricing they were charging for framing. It was easy to put together and the print looks great in it. The frame has a study and solid look and feel, and doesn't look cheap or out of place next to some custom framing I have in my office. Great value and buy."
1,Clunky and useless!,"I'll make this short and sweet - this case would only be marginally OK (clucky, heavy, and difficult to open) if I could use it, but since any set of earphones/headphones/earbuds that has a connector larger than the standard tiny Apple earbuds renders this case completely useless, as the headphone plug will not fit through the case opening. So my Grados, Sennheisers, Shures and everything I else I have in the house won't work with this case. You have been warned!"
2,Not Worth It!,"I bought this case because it was cheap and it looked good, but it was a big mistake. The case is way to big leaving the iPod room to slide around, and it is VERY hard to open. There is alos a huge hinge on the bottom of the case which makes it look very unappealing. There is also no protection for the wheel.The only think that I can say in favor of this case is that it does do a fair job of protecting the ipod and the screen."
3,Non Fiction,Small book picked up the Gambler's bookshop in Vegas to give a few tips for the occasional bit of recreational gambling while there.
3,love the moog...but,"musical equivalent to a whoopy cushion? cartoon music? production, playing, and synth timbers are good, and it is kinda fun at first, but it grows annoying after awhile and then, epiphany! it becomes abundently clear why the whole 'cheap trick' moog exploitation novelty thing died out in the 70's."
2,Pirate ShipThis hiop is just okay.,"This toy is just okay. Nothing special. It only have a few pieces to play with and looks like it was just cut from a printed fabric and sewn together, nothing too special. If you have child who LOVES pirates and needs a quiet time toy it might be a good investment. My son is only kinda into them and thus this toy gets little attention, he's much rather play with the regular plastic kind of ""guys""."
2,One of the all-time riddims.....,".....but these are not the all-time great versions, with the exception of ""Bam Bam"". Some great voicings (Marcia Griffiths, Sizzla, Sister Nancy) but the recut version of the riddim is cheap and...none of what makes it so exciting. The megamix is a gimmick and is, frankly, just plain horrible. If you want a kicking update of stalag/stagalag/whatever you call it, check out ""Stalag The Next Generation 20, 21, 22"". ..."
4,Small Frame Solution,"I bought this product because I have a 17.5"" frame moutain bike. This allows you to easily insert a water bottle into and out of your water bottle cage."
2,Daughter does not like this one!,I got this doll for my daughter because she pitched a fit for it. She rarely plays with this doll. It is heavy compared to her other first doll babies. I was very disappointed with it and especially with the baby bottle that comes with it. It does not meet the quarter guidlines for not being a chocking hazard. I am hoping that later on she will like this doll. It has such cute things to go with it now.
1,Doesn't work as advertised,"I opened my product and inside was a nice note from the manufacturer. Due to changes in daylight savings time, beginning in 2007, you will need to change this product's time setting 4 times a year in order to be accurate.Keep in mind that for any clock not as ""smart"" as this one, you'd only need to change it 2 times a year. That's right, this clock is actually LESS useful, and MORE problematic than another clock without the ""smartset"" feature.I wouldn't have a problem with this if I had bought the product before congress changed daylight savings time, but they thought it was enough to include a note rather than actually FIX THEIR PRODUCT!I intend to return this thing tomorrow."
2,Good Luck finding a battery,"I have owned my little gem for a few months now and all of a sudden, the little red light is lit telling me that my battery is low. I took it to a dozen stores and have not been able to find a replacement 3 volt button cell for this unit. The radio reception is fair for FM and just forget about trying it on AM. I sent an email to Emerson to see what they have to say. Put your money in a Sony."
1,Can't sleep with this clock!,"I love the concept and the price of this clock and bought two of them based on the reviews I read here, but I can't sleep with this clock in my room! It is SOOOO bright - even with the dimmer on low. I could actually read a book by it! I'm looking elsewhere for a clock that actually lets me get some sleep. Sorry this one wasn't it."
1,bad,"the hero did not love the heroine. he just wanted a mother for his son. he did not want to give her any child, but expected to raise a child of another woman. he always care for waht he wanted. he did not love the other woman and he did not love the heroine either."
3,Unhappy Christmas story!,"Marnie was married to Tom but he didn't want any children. So she left him and returned home.... Basically, I hated this hero. He was self-absorbed and juvenile. Who cares how he was treated in high school. By the end of the story I was routing for Marnie to show him the door!"
2,Boring as hell.,"I needed this book for a class in college. It was informative, loaded with information, and mind-numbingly boring. I got a good grade and I posted the final paper on hubpages, where it continues to get way too many hits. So, if you need the information in this book it is definitely worth it. Just make sure you have lots of coffee on hand."
3,PCH Tour,"The author is obviously a surfer dude and doesn't want you to miss any great waves. The book is a nice, laid back sampling of the historical and cultural highlights of the drive. There are very few pictures, especially for a book called a ""Photographic Tour"", and no maps whatsoever. It's good background info for the trip, but don't count on it as your guide to the best sights, which is what I was looking for."
1,Fun facts & mood descriptions in detriment of useful info!,"Funny book this one. By reading it, you'll know more fun historic facts and mood descriptions about places along PCH that you'll ever want (or need).On the other hand, it contains NO basic touristic info whatsoever; very few B&W; pics portraying nothing relevant and not a single map (not even those small ones displaying at least the regions the author divides the trip into).I must agree with others, this is a waste of time and money. If you want a not so extensive book about PCH, one that approaches only the basic (but relevant) of what to explore along the way, buyRoad Trip USA Pacific Coast Highwayby Jamie Jensen: A great little book covering most of what you need before taking the road!"
4,Great little holder,"This thing is pretty cool. I just want to make one comment though: At first, the holder will be very tight and your sidekick will barely fit in it. It only takes a week or so of this, and it will start stretching to be more loose, and get to the point where its easy to put in/take out your phone."
5,singular,"Bilame is at once horrifying, disturbing, transcendant, and sublime. The monolithic subterranean cityscape that serves as a backdrop for the story inspires a pervading sense of oppressive grandeur and silent malignancy. Likewise, the bizarrely jabbering and deformed monstosities that haunt the depths of its concrete labyrinths are truly the stuff of nightmares. The sheer scale of the city dwarfs the few humans to no more than crumbs or specks.Nihei's rough and expressionistic style bleeds raw emotion onto the page with savage scratchings and spatterings of ink, bringing to mind Piranesi and the etchings of Rembrandt. The storytelling is exceptional - novel camera angles heighten the drama and quick, sharp action sequences punctuate extended intervals of isolation. All in all Blame is a thoroughly entertaining and horrific read."
2,Horrible Tokyopop Localization,The text font was unbecomingly juvenile and was too reminiscent of American comic books. The diction of the translation was just as bad. The final result has the childish wording clashing with the complex art quality. The former wins out.
2,"Cool architecture, but overall poor manga.","I'll have to check out the second volume to form a full opinion of this series, but if this first book is any indication, I'd do well to pass on it.Nihei's background is architecture, and it shines beautifully in BLAME! Unfortunately the artwork doesn't transcend into the characters and action sequences. The action is sloppy and scattered, the panel transition is disjointed and difficult to follow.There's virtually no dialogue in this volume at all, so add that to the confusion and you've got a fairly weak title.There are some interesting ideas in this series though, a world consisting of thousands of levels of metal corridors and chasms being the coolest of which.Worth a look, but that's about it."
2,Monotonous,"Well volume one has almost no dialogue so it is mainly just a picture book and can be read in 20-25 minutes. The dark style of the art work just makes it plain dificult to see what is going on during the action sequences. Most of the backgrounds and characters look identical.I have read several more volumes inside of the bookstores because they are such quick reads, hoping the story and art would make a rebound but no such luck.I dont feel like this story was thought out, rather just created on the spot and the art work in my opinion is not pleasurable.If your looking for a good technology story, excelent art work and pleanty of action give Eden Its and Endless world a try."
5,Piece of Childhood,"This movie was something I watched as a child and I loved it! Funny, cute, and timeless characters makes this movie a perfect family flick. I am happy to say that my kids, years and years after I enjoyed the movie, were tickled silly! This movie can move through generations and I'm glad I got a chance to pass it on to my kids. I hope they'll do the same!!"
1,Another warning for prospective buyers: the VOD version is mislabeled.,"As Marc Scattergood stated, the Video On Demand version of 'Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent my Vacation' is not the full-length feature. Instead, it is the first entry (22 minutes) of the episodic TV-run cut, and nothing more.It's a shame because, comments on quality aside, I was otherwise excited to /finally/ have access to this title. If you don't mind the DVD, I see no reason not to pick it up--but if you're a 'cord-cutter,' you're better off waiting until Amazon or WB fixes the problem.UPDATE: 9/24/2012WB and Amazon have fixed the issue and the video is now the correct title."
2,Sub-Par Video Quality Distracts From Excellent Program,"After waiting years for this title to finally be released on DVD, I was left feeling a little taken by the horrible transfer process of this program to a digital format.In fact, the quality was so poor, My wife asked if they just transferred this onto DVD from an old VHS tape found at a yard sale bargin bin.How disappointed I am by this. However, its nice to have it on DVD even though the quality is about as bad as it gets."
1,Not for Little Kids,"I just watched this tape with my 4 year old son and he asked me to turn it off because it was too scary. One entire part of the storyline is a character with a chainsaw and a ""Jason"" mask trying to kill the Tiny Toon characters.The cartoon is funny at an adult level with lots of references about and parodies of famous movies, people etc. However, it really is scary for a little ones. Since Tiny Toons are shown on Nickelodeon and the box looks like it's geared towards young kids, I was suprised at the content."
5,THIS MOVIE IS SO FUNNY!!!!!!!!,"I love this movie! It is so funny, and reminds me of some of my vacas...AnywaY, buy it! bUY IT NOW!"
5,Good quality!,"Video worked great and the box was in very good condition. A rare find,was very happy to find it and at such an awesome price."
5,I LOVE THE TINY TOON ADVENTURES,"I Love The Cast Members of Tiny Toon Adventures, They Look Different and They Look Like A Sharp, And It's A Tiny Toon, Like A Brand-New Shipping 100% Graduation Grantrateed Accomplishing to We Salute Tiny Toon Adventures, and We Salute Steven Spielberg For Making For Us At The Top of Number 1 in the DVD Of the Country Like It's All Over The World, So They Brought Tiny Toon Adventures, How I Spent My Vacation Making The Original Movie As Run As Nickelodeon, FOX Kids, and Time Warner's Own Cartoon Network., And You Goona Be A Star Tresurer and You'll Sign Autograph. I Love The Tiny Toon Adventures. I Love This Game, That's Why We Ballin In The Here of the Game, Cause We're Home and We're House!, And It's Gonna Coming Up On Your Way."
3,"Great Little Movie, Nothing Extra","It's the original straight to VHS movie we all know and love now on DVD. It contains special features like, scene selection and subtitles. Yep, so basically nothing. That was pretty disappointing. :( I still recommend it. Great to watch and laugh again!"
5,Another Childhood Favorite!!!,"Ever since I was a kid, I've loved this movie. I re-watched it earlier, and it took me back to simpler times. It's summer vacation, and the movie shows how each toon spends their vacation. Buster and Babs Bunny spend their time with Byron Basset on the river and try to avoid hillbilly possums and redneck alligators who want to eat them. Plucky Duck goes along with Hamton Pig's family to Happy World Land as he tries to keep his sanity. Fifi Le Fume tries to get Johnny Pew's autogragh, Elmyra tries to get a kitty any way possible, and much more. I highly recommend TINY TOON ADVENTURES: HOW I SPENT MY VACATION!!!"
3,"Great Movie, Terrible TV Quality","First off, I wanna say if I were just rating this movie alone it would be five stars. I grew up watching it as a kid and loved it. Especially Plucky's story line. It is pure classic 90's silver animation.However, who else noticed how lazy they were with this DVD? It looks like a thirteen-year-old burnt it on his laptop. The menus are obviously templates and the themes have nothing to do with 'Tiny Toons' or Warner Bros. at all (except for the main menu). I expected the movie quality to be bad since it was converted from tape just like the episodes. But damn, it looks worse than it did on VHS. Hopefully no one who buys this will be watching it on a big screen. Your eyes may bleed.Regardless, I'm glad it's out on DVD. I just wish they would have spent a little more time cleaning it up. 90's TV animation gets no respect in regards to video quality."
2,Reminds me of the Dentist's office...,"It amazes me how famous someone can get by not writing a lick of music, but simply embellishing others' writings. This is pretty much standard lounge music, the type Billy Joel played before he got big, the same kind David Lanz played before he started adding his own compositions into his sets. Osborne's fills are showy, and he spends a lot of time playing things up a few octaves. If you like music you are likely to hear on the easy listening stations and department stores and expensive lounges, then this disc is for you. Personally, I could care less."
5,go 9ers,so happy with my hat. i love these hats. they are made for summer and hot sun and they look kinda boss too.
5,Safari hat review,Awesome item. looked everywhere for it and found it here!!! Highly recommend it to others if you are lucky enough to find it.
1,Entertainment Book Review,"I didn't really review the book itself. I had sent for an Entertainment Book for the Spokane, WA area. This book was not for this area at all.I had major troubles returning this item through you and as yet have not seen the credit posted to my Amazon Chase Credit Card.At this point your establishment has lost great credability with myself and my family.Ali Hemmelman"
4,enthusiastic,"you emerge from a reading whether chapter or the entirety full of information, history and amusemnt with which the author embues his peregrinations through spain to record the wine situation. and, oh yes, very particalized descritions are givenabout each area's wines for one's practical information. having been to the country twice it made me long to board iberia air lines for a prompt return. at very least, to start exploring the local wine shops,usa, and experimenting with some real kind of informed knowledge."
5,Like Wine & History? Here's Your Bible,"As someone who's trying to learn more about the ""wine culture"" after years of clueless intrigue, I finally found the perfect source. While it primarily discusses wines from a lesser known country/producer(Spain), this book provides a firm backbone that's easily translatable across wine regions around the world. Not sure what to expect when I started, I was quickly taken by the extreme detail discussing individual wines and vineyards, and how they vary from region to region. As much as I learned about various ""reds"" and ""whites"", I received an equally thorough education on the history of each region. Humor and a lighter tone throughout make this a fun, interesting, and very informative read."
3,Some intersting photos and ideas,"Not enough how-to in this book for me. I was interested in concrete for countertops, tables, BBQ area, etc. I highly recommend any of the books by Fu-Tung Cheng, for those interested in the principles of making concrete pieces. His book, ""Concrete Countertops Made Simple"" (with DVD) were excellent. Only around 15 bucks for his book and I have made beautiful counters, & learned a lot about form building along the way. If you're looking for ideas of what to do with concrete, you might find ""Decorative Concrete"" useful."
3,"not bad, not great","This book is not bad, but as another reviewer says, it lacks detail. It badly needs an expanded contents page. However, for the price the book is worth it.It has a lot of really nice pictures that give good inspiration, such as stains, test blocks and sinks. It has several good step by step examples, such as building a cast in place counter top, an upside down counter and a farm sink.The 'section' on floors is three inches of half page text and four pages of pictures, plus a two page project of covering a concrete floor with a commercial topping product.The center of my copy has sixteen pages duplicated upside down. Not a big deal, but the printer needs a bit better quality control."
5,Excellent book!,"I looked around through lots of concrete books trying to find one for work around the home. This one is the best! Lots of ideas introduces, with decent instruction. Still the best I've seen."
2,Missing the point,"The book was written probably some 15 years ago, when Real Options barely existed and the only tools available to consultants were efficient frontier and NPV. The treatment of risk vs. return is very simplistic, NPV concept does not hold any more (ROV is a way to go). In summary: an outdated book."
2,Not quite enough,"I recommended this to my friend based on the neck-through spec and all.When we received it, It was flawless.The string action is out of the world,.. 1.5mm and no string buzz.Neck as straight as arrow.But when we plugged it in,.. it sounded thin and plasticky.Also the sustain is not even average.I think the guitar is good but the pickup quality cannot match the body it came with.We sent it back and bought a Washburn XMPro white - was very impressed by it."
2,Not enough definition,"Although this book could be useful to the person who cares nothing of how things work, I found it extremely lacking in the area of defining the way Postscript works. From the outset, the book shows many examples which the authors touts as the best way to learn something. However, many of the examples used have little or no explanation of some of the cryptic commands contained within. You end up wasting a lot of time scratching your head trying to find out *what* is going on. It becomes a matter of wading through the entire book since many terms are not even listed in the index. A glossary and perhaps a command reference would have been extremely useful in this book."
3,"Too much graphics, not enough text","Although I found this book to be accurate, I did not enjoy it. Concepts jumped from chapter to chapter without any order. The index is totally lacking. It covered graphics completely but failed on handling bitmaps. It left text formatting to your imagination. As a programmer, I need to create reports. This book left me out in the cold. If you want to manipulate graphics using PostScript this book is for you. If you want to produce a spreadsheet on PostScript look elsewhere."
5,The Gun Digest Book of 22 Rimfire Review,"This book has almost the same title as one written by John Lachuk and published in 1978. Since I consider John Lachuk's book to be the best written on this subject, it makes for a good reference and source to compare to. In my opinion James House has done a very good job writing this book. It is sort of an updated version of the 1978 book. Very informative with lots of information on past and current 22's with test firing results. There isn't an area that James House doesn't touch on. Even though he has written other articles and books on weapons, I did not know of Mr. House before this book. Don't let that fool you. This book is well researched, well thought out, well laid out and well written. It might not overtake John Lachuk's book as the best on the subject, but I'd hate to have to live on the difference. Highly recomended."
5,Cheap and Useful,"Well, I bought this thing in hopes that it would work. I have been putting rechargeable batteries in it which I am not for sure if it is the batteries or the flash light at this point but it keeps going dim. But either way it works really well or appears too work just fine.We have been working on remodeling and cleaning up my girlfriends house to put it on the market for sale or rent and it has helped us identify where her cats were and where they went and urinated on the carpets; we have since really cleaned those areas and it has made a big difference on smell and appearance.I have also used it at my house to identify where our two little young puppies may go accidentally or if they go in their cage since we are cage training and it does a really good job at least for my uses.Be careful where you flash the light as, some things are best left unnoticed.Bradley"
1,Does Not Work AT ALL.,This product is completely ineffective. It is a complete waste of money. Do not buy it. Just to be sure it does not work I used in during the night right after my elderly cat urinated outside the box. Nothing showed up. Nothing!
1,Does not show urine,This only works in total darkness on a white surface.I requested a return but after packaging and calculating shipping it was not worth the trouble.Did the research and thought this was a good but not. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Plastic door breaks,Unfortunately the tiny pice of plastic meant to hold the door battery door shut will break on you either the first time you use it or the second. My seller was kind enough to replace the unit but to no avail the same problem. Other than the door issues the product I'm sure is just fine.
4,Not bad for what it's worth.,"People expect too much for this product. It's a small portable black light people.. of course it's not that great if you use it during the day (unless your blinds are good enough to make the room dark).Pros: Works well in dark rooms. I found 20+ pee spots in the living room. AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!!Cons: The battery cover is hard to push in. If I force it I feel like it's about to break. Right now I'm just using my thumb to push it in while it's turned on (since I only need it for a few minutes). The battery cover is poorly designed since the springs are too long that if you force it, it bends, not allowing the cover to be pushed in place.Other thoughts: It's cheap.. what do you expect... but it does the work."
2,Just okay.,"We bought the light as a urine finder for puppy pee. It's okay. Mediocre, at best. The room must be absolutely pitch black for it to work, and it picks up not only urine but every little white dust speck, so it's really hard to tell what's what."
4,"Works great for cat urine, but doesn't detect dog pee at all","I had one of these and used it with great success in finding cat urine when I had a sick cat who was having accidents. You could find the pee spots easily and make sure they were cleaned up. I now have a puppy and bought a new one of these (the old one was lost in a house flood) and it's not working at all, even when I shine it right on a dog urine puddle. I'm not sure if there has been a change in the light, or if dog urine simply does not show up under black light."
3,"Works fine, but cheaply made","This product was very cheaply made, so it breaks easily. The plastic pieces that hold the battery in broke off immediately when I opened it. In addition, my blacklight was leaking some sort of black fluid where the batteries go. I know it was the product, since my batteries were not leaking. Once I got the batteries installed, however, the product does work. I think there are better made black lights out there that would achieve the same task."
2,Battery Installation was ridiculously hard,"I had the hardest time trying to install the batteries, something that should have taken all of 2 minutes, took me about 20. I couldn't get the cover back on without it springing back up. I broke two of the holding tabs trying to get the cover to fit back on and then lock it. I finally was able to get the cover on, but since two tabs were broken during this process, the cover doesn't sit flat. I have it secured with a rubber band, but the light works. I don't blame the seller for this problem, but the manufacturer"
2,Does not work with our miniature dachshund's pee,"We have a miniature dachshund that is prone to 'accidents', and we have one black light (fluorescent) that finds her accidents easily. We were hoping that this would work as well but unfortunately it seems to be at a different wave length than the fluorescent one, and it won't identify any pee spots at all."
2,Urine finder doesn't work like it says it does,I have a cat that has started urinating in various places and I had a puppy that I was potty training. I was really hoping this urine finder would work. But it didn't live up to my expectations.
1,a rip off,"this urine finder is just a rip off, since it can't find urine if the urine was bottled and poured on it."
1,piece of junk - don't waste your time and money,This thing doesn't work. I used it in a room with no windows right after my cat had an accident - it was still wet - and NOTHING showed up. it's not worth the time and money. Now I have to waste my time returning it.
5,Urine Off Urine Finder,it made me sick to see all the urine in a rug I thought was clean. Now how do I get it off the carpet. I really was shocked to see what doesn't show up in regular light. It works great.
1,Urine Off UV Urine Finder Black Light,"We have 3 dogs and 3 cats who occasionaly will have an accident in the house. Our friends recommended that we buy a black light to keep help identify the wet spots. Unfortunately, this light is not large enough to do an efficient job. It was a waste of money."
2,Iffy,Battery tabs broke immediately upon receipt and item was slow to arrive. I contacted the company to track its where-abouts and did not receive a response. Two days later I contacted them through the Amazon website and received a response the next day. Item promptly arrived after that by USPS and was accurate. The light works but by far this was not one of my best Marketplace customer experiences.
2,Cheap Stuff,"This product may have good potential, but if you have wood floors or tile and keep this on a table where it may get knocked over, BEWARE. It must only work on dried pee, because my cat peed on a shirt recently and it didn't glow at all.I've had this thing less than a week, and it fell off one of the foldable lunch /couch tables onto the wood floor and broke. The light bulb didn't break, that was fine, but the battery cover flew right off and one of the plastic ends was cracked, so it probably won't even hold batteries if I tape it.This is a cheap piece of junk. If you're going to be careful with it then it may be ok. I just didn't expect for the plastic to break before the bulb..."
1,Waste of money!,Don't bother buying this. I purchased it to locate exactly the places my cat had sprayed so I could treat the correct places and this light did nothing! Don't bother buying it.
2,Not good,This light is very weak and small. I know exactly where my cat urinated and shined it there and it didn't glow pale yellow like it was supposed to. You are better off using your nose this light doesn't work.
1,bad purchase,"I bought wee cleaner and a light from the same seller but i got the them mailed from two different places . the black light won,t even come on , I put new batteries in and it just doesn't work . I called the manufactorer and they informed me that they didn't back this product.So I'm stuck with a light that I was charged for that doesn't work Donot buy wee cleaner because they sell you products that DON'T WORK."
2,Pain in the Butt,"This product is an absolute pain in the butt. I put in new batteries and screwed the cap back on, and it would flash on and then off again. It wouldn't come on. I had to adjust the tightness on the cap to get it to come on for like 1 second, and then it would go off again. It's SO incredibly sensitive, the cap has to be in the absolute perfect position for you to get it to work for maybe 10 seconds."
3,You get what you pay for,"I'm using this product to hunt for stray urine marks/spots from when my cat was sick and couldn't always make it to the box. The light is very small - only about 10 inches long. So, you have to hold it RIGHT to the floor and crawl around on your hands and knees to find anything. But, like I said, it DOES work - just more time consuming than I would prefer."
2,Its a black light,"The product does not look like the picture, in the sense of having that writting and I have to push down on the battery for it to turn on and so its a little less than ok. Does the job for finding small spots, thats why its compact and cheap"
3,Dancing in the early 1980s,"Megatron Man is an album of archetypical early 1980s disco. The title track has lovely synth lines and vocoder vocals with occasional drum breaks and sounds like a TV theme. Other interesting tracks include the instrumental Sea Hunt with its wistful keyboards and evocative syndrums and the uptempo Teen Planet with its hi-NRG beat. Get A Little is closer to 70s disco with its female vocals and skittering beat whilst Lift Off is built around impressive keyboards and Cowley's contemporary Paul Parker helps out on vocals. Thank God For Music and Menergy were probably Cowley's greatest hits. They still sound good, although noticeably 80s. The music has not aged as well as the best 1970s disco, perhaps because it is not distinctive enough and there are not enough memorable songs that stick in the mind. But Patrick Cowley will be remembered for his contribution to post-disco dance music in that decade."
3,For beginners only,"If your new to animation and web authoring, this book will be a big plus for you. If you are looking for advanced material on LiveMotion, I would recommend ""Adobe LiveMotion Classroom in a Book.""In this title, the authors are perhaps a little too cute, in a manner that speaks down to it's readers. It begins with. ""Are you a real greenhorn?,"" moves to a web-speak glossary (including chatroom shorthand) and wraps up with a suggestion to surf the web to study good design (not bad advice, excepting there's just so much bad design to make this a blanket tip).Of course in between these, the authors do indicate how to use the application, giving accurate descriptions of how to use each function in a relatively simple way.So again, a good book with the caveat that it is a beginner's title, not for intermediate or advanced web authors who are adding Livemotion to their tool box and want to get into the more complex aspects of this tool."
3,Good if you're an absolute beginner to graphics,"If you're already familiar with photoshop, illustrator, and have some familiarity of flash or vector animation, this book will only have limited usage. There might be about 50 pages of actual material you might need to know as this book spends a lot of time covering basic elements (graphic/drawing), and you have to wait until chapter 13 to get to the animation. Overall, it's not a bad book, but if you're already familiar with graphics and animation, then I suggest you look elsewhere. If you're new to this whole field, then it's a good start."
3,THIS ALBUM IS WORTH THE MONEY,"OVER ALL THIS ALBUM IS A STRONG ALBUM. I LIKE THE WAY IT WAS MIXED AND THE VARIETY OF SONGS ON IT, BUT THEY NEEDED TO ADD A FEW MORE HARDCORE SONGS ON THE ALBUM TO MAKE THIS ONE REALLY STANDOUT. PICK IT UP THOUGH, BECAUSE IT IS ENJOYABLE. YOU WILL LIKE E40, IDENITY, AND THE SHOCK G SONG."
4,NOT BAD FOR A DEBUT!,"WOW. THESE FIVE DOWN ARE A GREAT BAND AND THEIR FIRST CD IS AMAZING. ALL 5 MEMBERS OF THIS BAND HAVE BEEN THROUGH VERY TOUGH PERSONAL TIMES FROM JAIL TIME TO DEPRESSION. NOW THAT THEY HAVE ALL ACCEPTED CHRIST THESE 5 MEN HAVE A GREAT TESTIMONY TO SHARE WITH OTHER BELIEVERS. WITH THIS CD THEY SPREAD THE WORD OF GOD THROUGH HARD ROCK AND METAL MUSIC. THE GUITAR WORK IS INCREDIBLE AND THEIR SOUND IS EXTREMELY TIGHT. THE BEST SONGS ARE ""LOW"", ""ENSLAVED"", AND ""DREAM AGAIN."" THE WHOLE ALBUM IS ALSO GOOD, BUT THESE 3 SONGS REALLY STAND OUT AS THE BEST ONES. THESE FIVE DOWN CAN COMPARED TO GENERAL MARKET BANDS LIKE KORN AND LIMP BIZKIT AND ALSO OTHER CHRISTIAN HARD ROCK BANDS LIKE P.O.D. IF YOU LIKE ANY OF THOSE OTHER BANDS, THEN YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK OUT THESE FIVE DOWN!"
3,Not the best...,"Yeah the cd does have some good heavy metal riffs in it...i admit because i play guitar, but mainly all the singer does is talk in a low voice...i dont find that very musical. He does scream at times but when he does that he also is out of pitch. I've been listening to heavy metal christian bands for forever and i know a lot better bands then THESE 5 DOWN...If you want a talented band that knows how to scream checkout LIVING SACRIFICE or DEMON HUNTER...THESE 5 DOWN are going nowhere but DOWN. But if you are going to ignore my review anyway and buy this album i suggest #1,#5,#8...those are the only ones i like."
5,Good Influence On Your Brain,"There are a lot of hardcore bands that sound good, but a lot of them have bad lyrics (by bad lyrics I mean talking about murdering people and blowing up buildings and other bad stuff like that). The songs on this CD have that cool, hardcore sound, but also have good messages. What you put into your brain effects what you do. Don't listen to music that will make you want to solve your problems by murdering people or doing other bad stuff. Listen to music that talks about how bad that stuff is and about how good God is. (BUY THIS CD)"
5,AWESOME!!,This CD is the best! Definatley worth every penny you'll spend! The message is great and the musics the best! A really great way to witness! GET THIS CD!!
4,Still Great,"I listened to this album repeatedly in High School, then forgot about it for a long time. It still holds up and now I realize that John Mayall was a pioneer in creating one of the first ""concept"" albums."
1,Yikes! Preachy to say the least.,"This book is full of religious views and dogma to understand relationships. Not exactly science here. My own fault for not looking a little closer before purchase. If your not ""born again"" read something else."
3,Fairly dry but educational,These videos will teach you about the product but some parts are hard to stay awake through. The teacher talkes in a monotone most of the time. I would recommend this tape but have the fast foward key handy through some parts.
1,Off the Record should be Off the Shelf,Off the Record should be relegated to stay off the shelf. This book is a trite and an offensive advertisement for the authors own company the book is filled with conflicts of interest. A self promoting waste of time.Save your Money - read one of Peter Lynch's books instead.
2,This is not the blues,"Yes, these are great ladies but they are not singing the Blues. They are singing Jazz. As far as a Jazz album goes, I rate this 5 STARS.As a Blues musician, I was truely disappointed that the producer of this CD listed it as a Blues album. There's not a Blues lick on this album.If you're looking for great ladies to sing the Blues, don't look here. If you're looking for great ladies to sing slow sad Jazz, you found it.There are those people that will disagree with me on this CD. I have read the previous reviews. I'll state again, as far as a Jazz CD, absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend. As far as a Blues CD, no way.Seeing as I am not a big fan of Jazz, I have listed my copy of this CD on Amazon.com to sell as ""Like new."" Someone out there will enjoy this CD."
5,Getting Into It,"For someone who has always liked the blues, but doesn't quite know why, this CD helps make it clear. It's because of the way it makes you FEEL. The sultry, beautiful release it gives you, with all the female greats (plus Louis!), makes cooking, gardening, even paying bills a treat. Your hips will sway. You will bellow out along with them. Go for it."
4,Good all around pre-filter,"This K&N; Filter Foam Wrap was used around an Edelbrock 14' filter for a 360 Jeep engine. So far it has worked very well, keeping the air filter away from heavy mud and dust, and making the cleaning of most of the dirt a really easy task.Setup takes minutes, and it looks like it will last a long time. This is recommended for any serious off-road enthusiast."
1,IMPORTANT! NOT FOR KINDLE,"At least one other reviewer noted this problem and I wish I had seen his review: the Kindle feature which allows you to increase the font size does not work with the verb tables in this book. The ""zoom"" feature helps a bit but not enough for ease of use, for my eyes at any rate. Looking at the product info on the computer I see that there's a description for optimization for use on an ipad, etc, so maybe there are alternatives."
1,FONT TOO small,Unfortunately the font size would not enlarge on the Kindle. Otherwise it looked like a great reference guide if you can read small print.
1,Not for Kindle,"I have this book in paperback and like it very much. I got it for my Kindle. It is useless on Kindle, as the type, even at large font is too small to see."
1,Kindle version is unusable,"I agree with the reviewer who said it is not for Kindle. All the charts are tiny and do not respond to font size changes. The charts on the Kindle for PC viewer aren't quite as small but since there is no search feature yet, a reference book like this is rendered useless. Get the paperback, I wish I had."
5,Chico O'Farrill as major composer,"Latin Jazz has never gotten the credit it deserves (did you hear Ken Burns mention it?), and Chico O'Farrill is unjustly left off most lists of our greatest 20th Century composers. The O'Farrill - Gillespie partnership goes back to the 1940s, and this album finds both of them, well after the era they made their names in, still at an absolute zenith of their creative ability. I would compare this to the Gil Evans - Miles Davis collaborations."
2,I Disagree with Rosalyn from NY,I bought this cd based on those comments and found that although it is Afro Cuban it has too much of a Tonight show big band sound. This was recorded in '75 and nowhere near what was done in the '40s. look elsewhere..
2,the suckling,its an ok movie if u like fake camera views and bad acting and good blood this movie is for u
1,This baby sucks!,"Released in Britain as ""Sewage Baby"", that title more aptly sums up this filmWhat could have been a good film is killed by only a few faults; bad script, poor acting, and really weak/cheap special effects.Don't believe the other two reviews. It has no 'social message' about abortion. It is just a film exhibiting one badly mauled person after another - at the hands of an aborted child, who flushed into the sewer comes in contact with some kind of mutant-producing chemical waste! Yep, it's that bad.What would have been better is if the creature used its umblical cord to feed off its victims in some kind of parasitic way, instead of slashing them with its claws for no apparent reason - it doesn't really feed off them.Also, I was fooled into thinking that this was a recent film. It was made in 1990, over 15 years ago. It shows in that everyone still has 80s hair (it may have been made prior to 1990, and only first released then)."
3,fun live recording,"This is an exciting live performance by Cannonball Adderley (sax alto) with Yusef Lateef on flute/ oboe/ Sax(tenor), Joe Zawinul on keyboards, Sam Jones (bass), Louis Hayes (drums), and Nat Adderley on cornet. I don't understand why this album is more popular, the song list alone should grab some people attention- with songs like Brother John (Lateef) which has a great groove and Coltrane style blowing during Ole/ African Brass; Come Sunday of Black Brown and Beige (Ellington) with Zawinul playing the tender melody and sparse arrangments behind him but still sounding very full; and an excellent version of Work Song (N.Adderley) where the whole band works together as a tight unit. Although the playing through this album isn't super tight or dynamic- it is still very exciting with a lot of energy and great playing by all- Cannonball, Lateef, and Zawinul stick out though."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this movie because Shannen Doherty was in it. However, Shannen has a very minor part in this movie, and bottom line, this is just a really poorly made movie with a very weak script that is not worth spending the money on. If you were given it for free, even then, I would tell you not to bother to watch it and find something better to do with your time."
2,Boooh,"Bought this movie only because I like very much Paul McGillion (from ""Stargate Atlatnis"") and Shannen Doherty (""Beverly Hills 90210"", ""Charmed""). Both are cool actors but honestely, this movie is terrible and cheap filmed. The movie plays somewhen in the past but they have microphones/speakers? Anyway... its a fantasy movie and don't care about.But this movie is really cheapy filmed (its look like an amateur movie). The special Effects are for a small TV Channel good.5 Stars for hottie Paul McGillion3 Stars for Shannen DohertyZero Stars for the movie3 Stars for the DVD quality (Picture quality is good) and contains also English subtitles!FaZIT: only for fans of those actors."
2,"Okay, but not great","As is typical with these compilation cds, one recieves the shorter version of most songs when it is the unedited versions that became the hits;ergo, we ""Can't Get Enough""."
5,Barry White & The Love Unlimited Orchestra,"This Cd is so wonderful! I love the deep baritone voice of the music genius Barry White. All of the songs are great and I love the sound of a live orchestra! My favorite tunes from the Cd are CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF YOUR LOVE, BABE... I'VE GOT SO MUCH TO GIVE...STANDING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE LOVE.. JUST THE WAY YOU ARE... LOVE'S THEME.. RHAPSODY IN WHITE... POWER OF LOVE & BARRY'S THEME. if you are a Barry white fan get this Cd asap! You won' be sorry!"
5,Excellent!,"What can I say about the genious of Mr. Barry White! The Love Seal as he was known! I own many albums, CD's DVD's of this great great late singer! I'm sure that he's entertaining the angels in heaven right now! Right on, Right on brother! Let the Music Play Barry!"
1,Kindle edition is only volume 1 !!!,"Just a heads up for the Kindle users, the Kindle edition only contains volume 1, 2-4 are not included. The scan isn't very good either, not just mixed up letters it actually puts entire paragraphs in the wrong locations, for example a fragment of 837 is buried in the middle of 839.UPDATE: This version posted appears to be the publicly (freely) available version of Vol. 1 that you can get from several sites in many formats, it has the exact same errors."
1,Poor translation,I read thus original and bought this thinking it was the entire original set of work s from Pareto. It must have been copied poorly because there are typos galore which cause reader to miss intended meanings and it is essentially nonsense
3,"Found Vol 3 & 4, need Vol 1&2","I purchased Mind and Society only to find it was volumes 3 & 4, which started on page one thousand something. I'd be willing to trade with someone who has Vol 1 & 2 and then return it for my Vol 3 & 4."
4,"a visual playground created by women, for women","I'm a fan of the bishounen genre in general. I enjoyed this romance; on the first reading, turning each page made me smile anew, mainly because of the eye candy art. Laures is so over-the-top effeminate and pretty (although he occasionally manages to look a bit like Michael Jackson, but you can judge that for yourself). You Higuri pulled out all the stops when she invented him, not bothering to make him plausible; it's fantasy fun, pure and simple. That said, the rather simplistic plotline so far doesn't give the book much re-read value but I'm waiting for the following volumes to see print in English to find out how the story continues. I've been hoping for this series to get translated ever since I began admiring You Higuri's art back in high school. I even had a picture of Laures taped to the inside of my locker."
5,so cute!,"our baby loves this toy! ""manhatten toy"" really knows how to make unique toys and dolls. the banana can be attached to her hand by a magnet, the right ear squeaks, the right hand is holding a rattle and her left leg had some teething rings. it's got lots of things to keep her occupied. great colors on this toy as well.i wil be buying more things from this company."
5,great tit,"We have had this toy since my daughter was a few weeks old, and it is one of her favorite. The velcro loop on the back of the toy is long enough to hang securely on high chairs and the stroller, and the feet are perfect for teething. My daughter squeals when the monkey (with some parental assistance) does the monkey dance for her. Great toy."
5,Fun Puzzle,"I love these puzzles! They keep my 10 year old engaged while he works on solving them. They are difficult, but enjoyable."
3,Light and lively verse - Recommended,"Those seeking sophisticated verse will want to look elsewhere, but those who love simple rhyme and genuine feelings will delight in LOVE POEMS: FEELINGS AND FANTASIES. Richard W. Carlson Jr's exploration of love from youth to maturity will bring smiles to those who have also traveled the challenging and tumultuous path to love. With younger brother Kevin Carlson's charming illustrations, LOVE POEMS provides pleasing distraction in a world that seems to all to easily forget the enjoyment of young love. Recommended."
5,Excellent Tumbler,"I actually bought this at a BMW dealership. It looks simple, and provides grip.I bought it because it didn't have a handle, because I hate handles getting stuck on things.It keeps your drinks warm (or cold) for quite a bit of time.I've had many compliments on it.Great buy."
3,Easy to read book for new investors,This book covers the basics with a few novel ideas. Many of the ideas are common sense. A property manager would do well if he/she followed the ideas in this book. I recommend this book for a first time buyer of income property. The book does have some information on the long-term strategic management of a portfolio of properties. Both new and experienced investors sometime lack that type of thinking.
5,Going Back to Bacis and Then Some,This book brings you back to the basics and then gives you tips GALORE. You can tell this book was written from first hand day to day experiences of being in the business daily. Her tips are great and I found quite useful. I think this book is a good one to keep nearby so when you forget the professional tips you can bring out the book to refresh your memory. I think this book is great for property managers and investors new and seasoned.I found this book easy to follow and great to refer to for all aspects in the business. You can read it and be familiar prior to purchasing property too.
1,Does everything and nothing,"This book is aimed at getting more than the official line, but the author tries to touch on everything and nothing about managing rental properties into this four hundred pages. For example, when describing renovations, sections gloss over high priority items like roofing but instead describes everything from backyard gardening to the driveway and how the grass in the front yard should look. Some of it is common sense!"
4,Can't go wrong,"This collection nicely encompasses most of the Melodians' best tracks, allowing the trio to showcase nicelt their signature harmonies and vocal stylings.For all the great tracks it offers, like ""Swing and Dine,"" ""Little Nut Tree,"" and ""You Don't Need Me,"" there are several crucial tracks missing from this compilation that would make it the perfect compilation. Included in those missing are the great tracks ""I Caught You,"" ""Sweet Sensation,"" and the rasta based ""Rivers of Babylon.""For what it is missing, what the cd offers are first rate hits, and I agree with the other reviewer- it was carefully put together, and the re-mastering on it was wonderfully done. That alone is good reason to get this cd as a great starting point for this superb trio."
3,"good book, poor slipcase",I wish that I had known that the slipcase of this book is is just plain cardboard. It looks very cheap. The book itself is great and would be better off without the case.
5,Great!!,Pretty good book!! I bought it used and was in almost perfect condition other than a little highlighting.
5,Best Sugar Free Chocolate Syrup,"It is soooo hard to find a good sugar free chocolate product. But if you are in need (especially if you are a diabetic) and taste is important, then this product is the very best available."
5,Inspirational,"This film was inspirational on several levels. Seeing the raw grit required to undertake such a feet, watching the transformation in runners during the 100 mile journey, and finding that triumph doesn't always look so glorious in the process, was all part of what made this film so fascinating. If you are looking to watch a carefully orchestrated melodrama about runners, rent Chariots of Fire. This is real life. This is a 100 mile run!"
2,"Review of ""Dancing the Bear""","I'm a new trail runner and was excited about seeing this, especially since it said it followed two women's experiences training and on the run....the whole package, I thought. Well.....not quite. Yeah, it talked to two women, but included a lot of other people and you saw people just sitting down and eating, and what they did at the rest stops....It was kind of a let down. I didn't get much of the personal running experience of the women, the minute by minute of the trail and their own personal training. I won't even watch it again."
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"""14-0-0"" is a good song, but the rest of the album is most definitely lacking. I don't regret buying it, but most of the albums is pleasant backdrop tunes and not song-driven."
4,I want another one for my other bathroom,"I bought this a couple of months ago and it seems to be a good product. I would like to purchase a second one, I hope they get more in stock."
3,Drains battery power,I am not certain how long the UV light is supposed to be on but it doesn't stay on long. I like the concept but wished the light stayed on longer.
3,A semi louis Lamour book,"This book starts off pretty abruptly. It left me hanging until the part where one of the characters described how the main character was involved. There was not as much action in this book as say Kilkenny or The Mountain Valley War both of which you had sense of what the character felt. I have read about thirty louis Lamour and this one was my least favorite. I would recomend this book but with caution, some louis lamour readers may not feel that this book was up to standards of his other books."
1,"Rating This Book As ""Awful"" Is Being Kind!","Louis L'Amour's Kid Rodelo is one of the most amateurish, poorly written books I've ever read. It fails BIG TIME on every level -- weak plot, no character development, child-like dialogue and - oh, yeah-- it is totally predictable. It's been a long time since I've read a book by Louis L'Amour and the next time I'll be reading a book by him will be when hell freezes over! Please -- do not be swayed by the two reviewers that gave Kid Rodelo a 5-star rating. Do yourself a favor and avoid reading this book at all costs. I'm now going to take my copy and put it in the section of my house where I put books of this poor quality -- i.e., the trash.If you are in the mood for a good old-fashioned western, I'd recommend that you try Appaloosa and Gunman's Rhapsody by Robert B. Parker"
5,Walter's First Album!!!,Walter's debut from 87 is a very good effort I was lucky enough to find this on CD a couple of years ago so I could retire my vinyl copy.Another one to get on Cd is Just Kickin' It. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
4,Uncovering the truth behind the myth,"During my high school unit on Native American history and culture last fall, I used the Illiniwek issue to show my students the subtleties of racism. I wish at the time I had Spindel's book to drive her best point home: that white America needs its Native American symbols to justify our presence here on this continent and to forget a significant part of our shameful history. We also refuse to acknowledge the issues present day Native Americans face because then we would have to face up to the crimes of our founders. That it why supporters of Chief Illiniwek refuse to listen to the very people they claim to honor."
1,Don't buy from this company.,"Do not buy from this company! They charged me and never sent the item. Horrible company, buy from somewhere else!"
4,Nice case,The leather is soft and the fit is good. Nice additional pockets for accessories But the slot for the belt to go through should be little larger for wider belts.
3,"Buy ""All or Nothing at All"" instead","If you like late Holiday, instead of this you should buy a double cd containing 3 originals LPs (Body and Soul, Songs for distingue lovers and All or nothing at all):All or Nothing at All"
4,Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison:The Book,"Overall a very good book on the legend plus June Carter, Carl Perkins and the rest of Johnnys' band making their famous concert recording at Folsom in 1968. Many, many great pictures that you probably won't find anywhere else!!"
3,Not essential,"""The Queen's Suite"" is worth the purchase of this title. The remaining selections were written and recorded after the deaths of Billy Strayhorn and Johnny Hodges and show a marked lack of interest by Ellington."
4,A Lasting Tribute,"""The Queen's Suite"" is the most memorable work in this collection, and shows a respect for the Queen which she has rarely been given by other musicians. One of the more crass examples being the recent Golden Jubilee. Ellington offers up a lovely collection of vignettes that are most gracious and very entertaining. The Suite was written after his royal engagement in 1958, in which the Queen singled him out at the reception, apparently leaving him speechless in reply. Instead, he and Billy Strayhorn played for her a series of short pieces, which they eventually formed into ""The Queen's Suite."" The other two suites in this collection are also enjoyable, but don't have the same resonance."
1,Inconsisten quality of musical presentation,"Some of the pieces were not well performed, off key notes, orchestra not cohesive. Some pieces were energetic and strong as well as a really pretty piano piece by Duke Ellington which he played."
4,good family fun,"this movie was good fun with lots of crazy antics and good fun music, a bunch of youths in a london bus, adventures,romance,language problems and much more. If you like Cliff Richard or are simply a fan of music and laughs,this is the movie to see."
4,A First Movie Love,"As a boy growing up in Guyana formerly British Guiana I was introduced to the world of music via the BBC. Of course Cliff Richard was King to us in the British world. The second movie I ever saw was Summer Holiday, in Georgetown. It set the tone for the great passion I have for Film and Film History. The performances were absolutely natural and seemed so very real that I took the trip across Europe right along with the gang. A simple and fun story cemented with great songs. I highly recommend this for new fans to discover."
4,"Great unit, sort of small, does the job, a bit noisy","I replaced my Sony DHR-1000 with this unit because it does both DV and HDV. It functions just fine. It's much smaller that the old unit, it even can be set on it's side so it has a very small footprint. It has no display, it seems that it is just the inner workings of the old unit with the HDV ability. It has the same fan sound, but the old unit was huge and hid a lot of the noise, with this unit, there is nothing to hide the fan. The remote that it comes with is very simple, but it works. It does the job, Sony gets its money for it, but there's not much that will do the DV and HDV off the mini-DV tapes. My reason for getting it was to keep from having to use my camcorders and wearing them out capturing and editing video. The 4 stars rather than 5 is the fact it's a bit noisy, no display and the remote isn't anything like the old DHR-1000. It just does the job."
3,Nice HDV upgrade to DSR-11 but doesn't playback 24p/30p,"I purchased this VTR from J&R about 1.5 years ago to replace my DSR-11 and for the most part it works as advertised. It plays back DV, DVCam and HDV from Sony's FX1/Z1 shot at 60i but it does not playback 24p footage shot with Sony's V1 or Z7, or 24p/30p footage shot with Canon's HV-20/30. I just got an email today from J&R saying Sony has released the HVR-M15UA which is essentially the same model but it will playback 24p/30p HDV. Not sure if Sony us planning a firmware update or some other kind of upgrade program for us (unfortunate) M15U owners but given it's lack of universal HDV playback, I really cannot recommend this VTR unless you're only shooting/editing 60i material."
5,Sony HVR-M15U,This is yet another great product from Sony. It's the perfect follow up of the DSR-16 with its integrated HD support. I spent hours and hours talking to professionals in the field and reading spec sheets and this was the best bang for the buck. Great product and highly recommended. Works great with my Canon XL2 and X1 H1.
3,Good with Sony tapes but doesn't play well with Canon,"Despite other reviews at other sites that say that this HDV player/recorder works with all tapes, my experience is to the contrary. I have a small Sony HDV camera and the HVRM15U logs the tape into my NLE's (Avid Liquid and Premiere Pro CS3) without problems. But tapes generated from my Canon HV20 and XH-A1 don't play consistently. The HV20 material logs about 1/2 the time; and I don't even try to log tapes made on the XH-A1, because it just freezes.I also use Avid Media Composer 3.1 but could not get it to recognize the HVRM15U.I bought this to preserve my cameras' heads but find it to be an expensive endeavor. I would highly recommend it for someone working exclusively with Sony cameras."

5,"A FEMININE, PLAYFUL FRAGRANCE","Designer Nanette Lepore, a favorite of rock stars, actresses, wannabes, and the rest of us, recently released her first fragrance. It is very much like her designs - ultra feminine, playful, a bit flirty.She credits her daughter, Violet, for being her muse, thus the scent boasts notes of Crushed Velvet Violette, Amber and Indian Sandalwood. In addition, natural essences abound with Moonstone Rose, White Peach and White Cranberry Juices. The fragrance is as unique as the designer herself and just as appealing.The bottle reflects Lepore's ability to stunningly pair retro with modern - in a half moon shape it is delicately tinted with pink. A floral wreath adorns the bottle with a blush pink and black bow tied at the collar. The floral wreath is also captured on the box, which is decorated in a polka dot pattern. Tres chic!Nanette Lepore the fragrance is also available in Body Lotion, Body Cream, and Shower Gel."
5,Great Value for the Price!,"This item was shipped to me very quickly and was a great value for the price I paid. I love this perfume, I always have people ask me what I am wearing and they love it. I do recommend this fragrance, but I do hope that not too many of you get it because I am enjoying the attention of having this unique fragrance that not too many know about. :)"
4,Good,"I have recently started using the product, and I realize that it will take some time before results are witnessed, I am prayerful that it will work. I will keep you informed of my progress.Groganics Deep Freeze Scalp Absorbent Shampoo"
4,Good speculative fiction,"There is a qualitative difference not only in the writing but in the imagination between science fiction authors who describe the future. Vinge is one of those ""B+"" writers, not quite the top. The PEACE WAR was a great book and introduced the concept of ""Bobbles"", the huge bubbles into which one could safely escape to the future undeterred by weather, weapons or even time. With everyone bobbling the very idea of time itself was called into question.The characters are not your run of the mill novel players. We have, of course, the bobblers, then there are the high-techs (humans with extraordinary tech ability from right before the time of the Great Extinction when humanity vanished. Then there is the detective, the best around since he's the only one around. He searches for a murderer amid the attempts by the high-techs to gather humans from the bobble and recreate a new human civilization. The writing is not technical, and the book is very brief."
5,Memories of Vacation,Recently spent a week in Jamaica right before Christmas. This music was played around the pool area. Just wanted to keep the vacation going so ordered the CD right after we arrived home. Love it.
2,Disappointing,"Perhaps reggae and Christmas music just shouldn't go together. I previewed a lot of songs from this and other reggae Christmas albums and thought I would like this one, but I burned out on it after playing it the second time. Very cheesy."
1,"Get it together, Amazon","How can this CD with a release date of ""Original Release Date: 2011"" have reviews from 2000? If this is re-relese the reviews should be only from the new release date on. This 'carry over' is done way too often on amazon not only with CD's, but also with DVD's and Blu-rays. The Blu-ray will have the exact same reviews as the DVD. One would think the Blu-ray would have its own review as the content (extras) and quality would be different than the DVD."
4,A New Switch for the Bee Gees,"Main Course was a new and fresh album for the Bee Gees. Because the previous album Life in a Tin Can didnt go anywhere on the US Chart since Run to Me (To Whom It May Concern), so the three guys have to think up something that will attract the public interest. They switched the recording studio, and there was a bridge that the BG's had to cross everyday. Barry made up the song Jive Talkin' by using the rythem on the bridge. During the recording of Nights On Broadway, Barry found his new hidden voice, the falsetto voice. There, they started new rock songs, such as Winds of Change, and Fanny (Be Tender With My Love). But they still kept their old ballad form of songs, that shows in Songbird, Country Lanes, and Edge of the Universe.Because of their success of changing from old ballad songs to more of rock songs, they achieved #1 in US Chart with the song of Jive Talkin', and #7 with Nights On Broadway."
2,Remastering Malpractice,"Tony Manero be damned, Main Course is one of many artistic high water marks for the Brothers Gibb that easily equal or surpass their Saturday Night Fever explosion, offering a dense and diverse palate of rich harmony and even richer song-craft - making Rhino's handling of this re-release uncharacteristically short-sighted and an object lesson in marketing and engineering malpractice.Rhino's senseless indifference to sound quality needlessly undermines a seminal, underappreciated record by electing to deny a long overdue remastering. Why buy the rights to the title just to be bad stewards?I have records remastered off of old 78 rpm cylinders that sound cleaner and more resonant than this much younger recording. You would have thought that with seventeen years to improve on the sonics of the original cd release, Rhino could have, should have gotten around to it.Regrettably, it's buyer beware for a personal favorite that deserves better."
3,The Gibbs' comeback album.,"Originally released in 1975, ""Main Course"" brought the Bee Gees back to the Top 40 with the dance hit ""Jive Talkin'"" and classic soul ballads ""Nights on Broadway"" and ""Fanny Be Tender (With My Love)."" Other tracks like discofied ""Wind of Change"" and quasi-bombastic rocker ""All This Making Love"" (complete with tiger sound effects) haven't aged as gracefully. ""Main Course"" represented a transition for the Bee Gees, as the group demonstrated its R&B sensibilities on much of the album's first half, while retaining its cloying pop harmonies on piano ballads ""Songbird,"" ""Country Lanes"" and ""Baby As You Turn Away."" Most of the album's best stuff is on the ""Bee Gees' Greatest"" double CD, so unless you're a fan or a 70's connoisseur, that may be your smartest buy."
4,Exelent example of seventies rock,Probably the best album that the bee gees recorded consists of love ballads in rock in roll style
5,back to the top.,"This one put the boys back on top and they stayed there for years to come. They were huge international stars and then this period of music began. The two hits here 'nights on broadway' and 'jive talkin' were danceable and that's the direction that would lead them into the stratosphere, and lets be honest disc is five times better than rap or hip hop will ever be. But the bee gees on this one are rock and good rock at that. They do it right on this cd. It's a good one to own with well crafted songs of a master group. Sadly only one of the brothers is left, even andy is long gone. Btt their music lives on."
5,Japanese reissue 2004,"The same track list of US Version. This 2004 reissue includes 16 albums of Bee Gees, including ""Here at Last"" a long out of print in US.1. Nights On Broadway2. Jive Talkin'3. Wind Of Change4. Songbird5. Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)6. All This Making Love7. Country Lanes8. Come On Over9. Edge Of The Universe10. Baby As You Turn Away"
5,No Jive.,"All right, enough crticism about disco. The Bee Gees were never disco. Anyone who really listens to them knows this is true (just listen to the music they made prior to 1975 and after 1979). However, Main Course (1975), I think, is their best, most consistent cd. 10 tracks that have diversity not only in content and sound but in tempo and creativity. The hits ""Jive Talkin'"", ""Fanny (Be Tender With My Love)"", and ""Nights on Broadway"" are all here, plus the non-hits ""Wind of Change"", ""Songbird"" and ""The Edge of the Universe."" I feel Main Course to be better than 1976's Children of the World and 1979's Spirits Having Flown. Main Course is a must have for any rock collector. The Bee Gees were in their finest form here."
5,One of the Best,Great price and great music. I miss them so much. May the members who are gone rest in peace. They will never be forgotten.
1,Totally Discusted I gum it for now on if I cant find something better!,They melt in my mouth. I would like to return them for a full refund. they were hard too get out of my mouth.
3,strips work,the strips work but not as long as i thought i use them with the secure adhesive which is good
4,Wonderful recipes,"This book is not for identifying wild plants. It is a recipe book only, but it is one of the best I've found for southwestern plants! A must have for those who live in the Southwestern US."
5,Excellent,I got this for my mother in law who is knowlegable about herbs. She absolutely loves it. It has great recipes with explanations.
3,Pretty okay cult horror film!,"Fairly high-strung and obscure horror flick about a crazy scientist who runs a ""hospital"" where he ""cures"" his mental patients by giving them a special lobotomy that allows him to control their every action. This movie has it all. A mad scientist, hippies, nudity, an over-the-hill prostitute, a crazy train conductor that sort of reminds me of that nutty dude Angus Scrimm from Phantasm, and even a midget. Not bad if you're into campy 70's style horror. Good stuff... but don't watch it alone. No, not because it's too scary, but because it's nice to share the laughter with your friends once in awhile."
2,Lame...very lame,"After seeing Michael Gough's bizarre performances in such ""classics"" as ""Konga"" and ""Horrors of the Black Museum"", I was expecting to see something similar in this far less well known ""Horror Hospital"".Sadly, that was NOT meant to be. The film is long and tedious with only occasional cheap special effects. Gough, a mad surgeon at a ""rest"" home, is restricted to a wheel chair and the action does not mainly revolve around him, but, rather, around some young people trying to escape his clutches. I found myself wondering when it would finally end after viewing about 30 minutes of it.I know a really great B movie when I find myself wanting to view it several times in a row or coming back to review it every few months or so. I feel no such desire for this disappointing production."
4,It's Good For What Ails Ya...,"Got problems? Feeling run-down and out of sorts? Well, a nice stay at Brittlehouse Manor will fix you right up! Doctor Storm (Michael Gough) along with his teeny tiny henchman, Frederick (Skip Martin) and his nefarious nurse (Ellen Pollock), will get you straightened out. Of course, you must not question their methods. What? You don't like being lobotomized? Scalpals make you queazy? Come on now, you simply must get over these irrational fears and hang-ups! Allow the doctor to work his magic, and join his growing legion of zombie slaves! It's all good therapy. Do watch out for the mysterious, murderous, pink goo-man though! He's bloody dangerous! HORROR HOSPITAL is packed w/ enough insane idiocy to keep any schlock-maniac as happy as a termite in a woodpile. Decapitations! Nudity! Mad science! Hippies! And so much more! Buy immediately..."
4,Now Here's A Doctor Worth Losing Your Head Over,"I love Horror Hospital, it is camp, gothic and quite funny as a guy looking to get away from it all goes there for a bit of relaxation.As it said in the flyer, Hairy Holidays and things get hairy alright, with heads flying and people being medically adjusted to the sick doctors delight, oh and there is some kind of creature stalking the place as well.Good to see Michael Gough (who gives an effective perfomance) and the ever so camp Dennis Price.Fans of Hammer and Amicus films will probably enjoy this.So if you'd like to see something off the wall as well as up it, check out Horror Hospital.The doctor will see you now..."
3,Someone to love,"An experimental film, a movie within a movie. A filmmaker throws a Valentine's Day party at a theatre that's about to be torn down and invites a bunch of people who are alone; he then goes about asking them why they are alone and do they like it. It's all pretty pretentious and self-indulgent, with some very banal comments made about a very banal society. Orson Welles appears, his last screen role before he died, and he among them all has some of the most banal things to say. There are a few interesting points, a few of the characters reveal some things to ponder (and generally be sad about), but it's not enough. So much of the acting has an improvised feel about it that one begins to wonder if a lot of it actually was. Jazz fans will notice Dave Frishberg in a fairly big acting and singing part."
5,Free form at its best,"This is a great record, must be the finest available in the free form idiom. All four players are magnificent, not least the bassist Buell Neidlinger.This is not really difficult music to listen to either. Just listen to the opening track; this is hard swinging improvised music of rare quality.This is fascinating music. What an exciting pianist Taylor was (and still is)!The sound quality is absolutely splendid. Highly recommended!"
4,Embryonic journey,"This is weird. On one hand, you have Cecil Taylor's inimitable piano approach, not yet fully developed but definitely on the way. On the other hand, you have a pretty conventional bop rhythm section - straight-ahead bop drumming, walking bass, and vibraphone. The rhythm section anchors Taylor, in both the good and bad senses of the word.My sense? If you're already into Cecil Taylor, it's a worthwhile addition to your collection. But if you're new to Cecil Taylor, start with one of his later solo piano albums and get used to him first."
3,Disappointed but still a good CD,This product arrived in good condition and several days early than the expected arrival date. Two albums for a low price was terrific but I am disappointed the albums were not remastered digitally as I had read in another review. Sound quality is pure but very low and I must play at a high volume to keep the same reproduction as I do with the vinyl album Magnetic South.
4,Slow but good,"My 3 1/2 year old daughters really enjoy this game. They received it a few months ago for a Christmas present. The software is rather slow going from scene to scene, but it doesn't seem to bother my daughters. They have enjoyed solving the problems in each of the 4 games (you usually have to find something that a character needs in order for them to show you the clue). There are also some fun activities in each game (like hide and go seek in one game). Overall, very good software for children. They have been able to do it completely on their own without a problem."
4,"Love it, but a few gliches","My daughter (2 1/2) is an avid Blue's fan, and this was our first computer software purchase for her. While she enjoys it immensely, she is also frustrated by the wait time (she keeps telling Steve to hurry up and move into the next scene.) I am not very pleased with the sound quality. The songs go much faster than the graphics, thus Steve is finished moving well before the music is finished playing. Overall I find it engaging for her level and if you have the extra cash recommend it if your child likes Blue."
2,Where are the CLues???,"Although the kids enjoy this game because it has characters that they like, it seems impossible to find all the clues and solve the riddles. Both myself and another Mom grew very frustrated trying it oursevles. We are both University educated women, so if we can't do it, I don't know how they'd expect a young one to."
1,worthless,dont trust me trust popular mechanics:[...]oh and you are welcome.PS the otherguy is only getting better fuel mileage because of his cold air intake. you want better gas milage get one of those.
1,Complete failure,"This film is a complete failure. Expectations are set high not only by the overall reputation of French as great masters of comedy, but by the admirable cast as well (Belmondo, Cardinale, Rochefort). However sloppy directorship, shallow script, dumb jokes, primitive ideas and lazy acting result in utter disappointment. Could only last watching first 10 minutes of the film."
2,Close but no cigar,"The book is very redundant and made me think that I was missing the points it had made in the previous passages. I found it a disconcerting and felt a good editor could have helped, although it would have shortened the page count considerably and perhaps not made it enough for a book."
5,NOT a rendition of Faust,"This book is NOT a rendition of Goethe's Faust, as one reviewer mentioned. Marlowe wrote the original version (Doctor Faustus), and Goethe rewrote it with his own ideas of forgiveness in Faust. Both versions should be read, as they are often quite different in plot and, espeically, conclusion. Almost competely different stories, both are worth reading for their theological and spiritual value. Doctor Faustus is a quick and easy read, but filled with great stuff! A must read for anyone who appreciates classical literature."
3,Not completely satisfying,"The story of Dr. Faustus is that of a supremely educated man seeking still more knowledge. The only way he sees to get what he desires is to make a deal with the devil. He signs his soul away for 24 years of service of one of Lucifer's servants, Mephistopholes. He thinks of repenting and there are friends and angels who try to persuade him, but he continues on his course for the full 24 years.This is a well written play and it is a bit creepy to put yourself in the position of Faustus and imagine selling your soul to the devil. My dissatisfaction comes from what I see as a weak motivation from Faustus and a thinness at the plotpoint of Faustus wrestling with what he's done. There wasn't as much of an internal struggle shown as I expected. For a play that has held up for 400 years I was expecting a little more depth."
5,Dr Faustus by Christopher Marlowe,"Thank goodness for Amazon.com, I was able to get this item, as well as all of the others before my Degree course began. The item arrived in plenty of time and in the condition I was expecting, many thanks to the seller AND to Amazon.com."
4,"A deal with the devil? Well, no just a good read.","This book brings us a slightly different take on Dr. Faustus. The tale deals with a professor who offers his soul to Lucifer in exchange for fame, wealth, and knowledge. He enjoys the benefits of making the deal, but all the while wonders whether his soul can be saved. Some try to convince him that it can be saved, but he fails to act, and in the end, his soul is taken by Lucifer. Marlowe's take on this story is a very good one, but one that has underwent some obvious editing. So get it, but be forewarned that somethings may be hard to get through at spots."
5,The devil at play,"Well, the other reviews seem to talk about German legend, Goethe, spying, and being stabbed in a pub, so I'll skip all that. I'll just say that this is one of my favorite plays.Here's an idea: why not order ten or so copies of this very reasonably-priced play and have your friends over for a Dr. Faustus party? You will need old costume dresses and some fresh fruit. It will be fun. It's better than Trivial Pursuit, anyway."
5,A nice adaptation...,This seems to be a good point to enter the Faust myth for those interested. Marlowe retells Johann Spies' tale with theatrical flourish.
2,Legendary Gospel,"It was not what I had thought it would be, I thought that it had more of the old gospel singers and songs."
2,Old Time Gospel,Alot of the songs were older than I expected and I didn't enjoy them as much. I enjoyed a couple of songs.
3,Not as good as 2000 years of human error.,"Darn! I had high hopes for this band, but unfortunately without Marilyn Manson behind production this band sounds like just another band soon to be forgotten. The previous record (2000 Years Of Human Error) was amazing!!! Not so much here. Just a typical industrial band with a typical effort to be more mainstream."
2,Compact design is there when you need it (until it fails),"As a working stiff who sometimes struggles to make it out the door with enough light to finish my run before darkness sets in, this is the perfect small, reliable light that I can tuck in my pocket and have if/when I need it. Admittedly, the odd battery size is a bit annoying, but it puts out great light for its size and is well enough made that I'm willing to overlook this one issue. This little tool has been just the ticket to get me home safely despite losing all natural lighting.I'm updating this review after using the light since 2011: It stopped working. Changed the battery and it's still not working. The switch will click, but no light.I used this light as a last resort tool to get home if one of my trail runs went long. Having it fail without any warning was more than a little inconvenient. I've since replaced it with a Petzl e-lite. Roughly the same size and weight, but brighter and much longer battery life."
3,"""The Pump House Gang"" story only: Close but no cigar.","Because I grew up in La Jolla, and graduated from La Jolla High School, class of 1962, I was only interested in the short story: ""The Pump House Gang.""I know most of the characters in the story, and believe that Wolfe did a good job describing them. His account of the La Jollans visiting the Watts Riots was right on. I visited the riot zone myself, and enjoyed the same experiences as Shine, Nelander, and Sterncorb.Wolfe came as close as any ""outsider"" has been able to do, in analyzing the La Jolla nut house, the institution where the walls fell down, and none of the inmates left."
3,Not Really Worth It,"I bought this for my son and it does not come with all the Titans. It comes with one Titan. It is not made that greaat, not really durable, but my son loves the Titans and did like this toy."
3,Doesn't come with Titans,"It doesn't come with Titans, but it's still fun. And for you idiots that don't feel like buying them seprately don't complain about it."
3,Sociology CLEP,I thought the book covered a lot of information but there was a lot missing! Some of the major theorist in sociology were hardly discussed yet those were the questions on the practice exams. I passed the exam with a 63 (you need a 50) but was very frustrated with the book when a lot of the questions were on theories and theorists not even MENTIONED in the book...it could be better but I did pass so I can't complain too much!
4,I was able to test out of Sociology in a week!,"I used this book for my test prep for the CLEP Introductory Sociology test. With the help of this book and the Accelerate University program, I was able to pass my test in about a week! This book is extremely helpful in preparing you for the CLEP test! I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to pass this exam!"
4,It's enough to pass,"I had to test out of Sociology, in order to meet credit requirements to graduate this fall. The book was enough for me to pass with a score of 66. If you study the materials of the book and practice the tests a few times, you'll know enough to pass the exam. The study guide covers about 70% of the test material. The other 30% were concepts, vocabulary, and present-day trends that I had never heard before. Nevertheless, by process of elimination, you'll be able to make an educated guess. I studied about 10 hours, a week before I had to take the exam. Good luck!"
3,Good but missing some subject areas,"The book was good in terms of what it includes. But it leaves out some areas that are on the CLEP test, like demography and urban ecology. The practice tests are very helpful but there is lots of stuff in the practice tests that wasn't covered in the book. I supplemented the book with Wikipedia."
4,"Good Review, But Isn't Enough","I just took the CLEP Intro. to Sociology and passed with a 70 out of 80 on the test. I got this book a week ago and studied it thoroughly (outlines, read it three times, etc), and I also got the practice test from the CLEP site this morning to look over. This book itself covered only about 40-50% of what was on the test.My suggestion to pass the test is to study this book completely - including the answers for the practice tests (since a lot of the information is covered there and nowhere else in the book) - and then google every topic on the practice test from the CLEP site and you should be fine."
3,needs updating,"I bought this guide 2 months ago and memorized almost everything in the book and on the CD. I took the clep test yesterday. I passed, but only by 4 points with a 54/100.This book is successful in helping with understanding TERMS of sociology, but the majority of the clep test questions were on gender issues, sociological theorists and their ideas/viewpoints, and economic social issues. If the book were to update and put this info in it I would then rate it 5 stars."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I took the clep exam about an hour ago. The good news is that I passed, but the bad news was that this book did not prep me well. About 25% or more of the questions weren't covered in this book. Because of this I was anxious, nervous and skeptical that I would even pass. I would suggest purchasing a sociology textbook to get further explanations that this book didn't provide. Some of the questions on the test asked about specific situations and details that a texbook would have. This prep book is a general synopsis of theories and the basics, definitely not enough to pass the test with complete confidence. The test itself covered a greater scope of sociology that this prep book did not. Do NOT rely solely on this book to pass the test."
2,Just Barely Enough,Not enough info.... had to refer to other sources... The Cliff Notes Sociology is very good. I purchased it from this site as well for under $ 5.00 All in All I studied for about a week.. scored a 52 passing is passing...
2,Sociology clep,"This was an o.k. book depending on what questions you are given on the CollegeBoards exam. For most of the questions I were asked none of the info in the book was of much use. Thank goodness I had other reference books I read. Out of all three practice test, I only saw 6-10 questions on the test that were even close to the questions given in the book. My suggestion is to go to the CollegeBoads exams website and print off their study guide if you want a real study guide as to what is on the CollegeBoards test! Don't waste you money on this. Their study guide is only $10.00....."
5,Excellent service,"I was very pleased with how quickly my order was received, and it was exactly as stated on the website."
4,YUM,"Hugh Jackman is delicious in this poster. The only part I am disappointed with is that it is on kind of thin paper, which may not hold up to a move once you have it up on the wall. I'm going to laminate it first, which should take care of the problem."
1,Beware,"If your wireless router does not support WDS and evidentially most don't, this will not work with your router"
1,Utter Nonsense,"As someone who has practiced Wicca, and taught the Craft for over two decades, I can safely say that this is the worse book on Wicca I have ever read.The material in this book is just plain silly, and of absolutely no real use to anyone. The problem is that new beginners won't realize it, and the book will only serve to further corrupt the integrity of Wicca."
1,The Book of Misguiding Information,"Alright, here's the down low.If you're JUST beginning your path as a Pagan, Witch, or Wiccan; stay the HELL away from this book. This book is full of misguided information about herbs, candles, crystals, and so much more that you will be utterly confused if you ever pick up another book on Wicca. This title is even fictional. There is no such thing, to my knowledge, that is called 'the Wiccanning' and it is certainly not a commonly used term in the pagan community. Honestly, I just can't even explain how many errors there really are on every single page.It's so infuriating for someone who's been practicing for a quite a while. Just pick something else to start with. Hell, even Silver Ravenwolf is a better starter than this hogwash."
2,Christo-wiccan,"I must say this is a good reference book. It has many uses in it, how ever this person Sister Moon Knows nothing about the Beliefs of Wicca. She states Wiccan's believe in a Satan, a Haven and Hell. This is ridiculous! No true Wiccan believe this. Her story of the origin of the goddess and god is almost the same as the Christian belief of its origin of there God in the bible. I suggest people who get this book to over see what she try's to teach you about her beliefs and own views of Wicca. There are better books that teach the true history like Scott Cunningham or Silver Raven Wolf. Take the good and useful from this book! Don't believe everything you read! Do lots of research. Get different views. Only believe what you are comfortable with! Good luck with your JourneyBright Blessings"
1,Naively ignorant at best.,"This book has some pretty good correspondences, other than that it seems to me that the author has quite a touch of Christian Mysticism in her teachings. Of course that would be fine, however she is passing this off as Wicca. She also makes claims of Wicca as an ancient religion. We may pull what we know from pre-christian ideas, but Wicca is a 21st century religion. If you are looking for a good beginner book check out Scott Cunningham, Phyllis Currott, or Silver Ravenwolf. Happy reading."
1,Boo,When i first read this book i was 12 years old. I am now 15. After finishing this book an i thought it was ok. But then upon having my aunt and cousin read it ( being older and having practiced more than me) i decided it was the worst book i have ever read on wicca. Your money would be better spent on other books.Iam not trying to be rude but i think that Sister moon has no idea what she is talking about. Thank you for your time. Blessed Be.
2,umm......,"It seemed to me that the author of this book was writing as if her religious views were views of the entire Wiccan community and that her way the only way to do anything. I was also under the impression that she was claiming to be a traditional witch whose family has been Wiccan for more than 50 years.....it just didn't strike me to be a very reliable book. On the other hand, there was some good information in there about things other than the religious aspects...things like divination."
2,Maybe good for a start but...............,This book makes a claim that wicca predates christianity...Ummm think not... wicca is about 50 years old. Go out and read more solid books.. better yet.. talk to other people who pratise the craft.. rather than just reading about it.
2,What was I thinking?,"I've tried and waited patiently for years to find this album on CD and what do I get for my efforts? A big question mark on my sanity! What in the world was I thinking back when this first was released? Why did I absolutely 'love' this, way back when? Must have been the drugs, 'cause I can find nothing redeemable in this recording. Too much money for such a 'crazy' CD. There is too much doubling of music throughout this CD and not in a good way."
3,Weird Album Cover,"Arthur Brown's ""Fire"" is a great song...but the album cover may be the strangest in music history. And to think that it came out in the same year of Simon and Garfunkel's ""Bookends"" in which its album cover was the polar opposite to this (in black and white with Paulie and Art looking at the camera)."
4,Arthur Brown - 'The Crazy World Of Arthur Brown' (Polydor),"Originally released in 1968,as this was the debut record by Arthur Brown.Total of fifteen cuts.There are both mono and stereo mixes of ""Prelude-Nightmare"",""Fanfare-Fire Poem"",the unforgetable ""Fire"",""Come And Buy"" and ""Time/Confusion"".Sort of also liked ""I Put A Spell On You"" and their gritty cover of James Brown's ""I've Got Money"".Never knew it before I listened to this CD,but Atomic Rooster's Vincent Crane(R.I.P.)was the organist here.Nice lp reissue to have.Best described as zany psychedelia.Might appeal to fans of H.P.Lovecraft,Syd Barrett,Love,The Seeds,Fifty Foot Hose and West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band."
4,The search for Charles,"In the middle 70's, I heard a song from this album, most likey ""Fire."" I decided I had to have this record. I started at Peaches (long since dead and gone I believe). At least 10 record stores later, I still hadn't found it.I looked on and off for over 2 years. Finally, I was looking in a used record store around the campus of OSU (that's Ohio, not Oklahoma!) where, to my surprise, I finally found it.I think my search is a testiment to how important this album is and how good it is. I like the themes of evil on this record that show that artists can be inspired by evil as well as goodness. While I am not in evil's camp, good is best defined by its opposite.I have loved this album ever since I found it."
4,A good record,The first song was a big hit. We just played it over and over. The rest of the album is good too. Amazing
4,shape of things to come,"besides the obvious link with the horror/shockrock of alice cooper and marilyn manson,musically it's linked more with bands like deep purple/atomic rooster and the pre metal vocalization of ian gillan,rob halford and bruce dickenson."
1,The crazy world of arthur brown,This is the worse cd that I ever bought. It was a waste of time and money
4,This album is quite wild,"The psychedelic 60's were wild, but this album is among the wildest of that era. Arthur's voice is operatic and the playing at times sounds like a firestorm of psychedelia as the band rips through guitar-less songs with reckless abandon. ""Fire"" may sound familiar to fans of oldies rock radio, but ""Child of my Kingdom"" is both loud and melodic. The album opens with a screamer that sounds like a set opener, as horns and Arthur's screaming crescendo at the end to prepare the listener for quite an experience. This album is weird and very British. Carl Palmer, later of ELP, is the drummer."
2,Wrong edition of the book,"I have an EATERS CHOICE cookbook that has been used for years and I needed a new one. I did not realize that an updated edition would be so different. The recipes that we live on are not in the new version. I have since located a 1987 version but wanted people to know that the recipes in the old cookbook are EXCELLENT, especially the desserts. No one believes me when I say where they came from. I had no problem with the seller, or the condition of the book I ordered."
3,Same Old Same Old,This book gives the same facts and tips about lowering cholesterol that most other books have. Recipes are o.k. but mundane (which I guess would be good for people just starting to change their diets.)
4,One of the Best UK Soul Artists Ever,"If you're a fan of classic 90's UK Soul like Lisa Stansfield and Soul II Soul, it would be a crime not to own this CD. Drizabone's production is always classy, tasteful and understated. This album contains 3 tracks that are just absolutely heavenly - ""Real Love"", ""Brightest Star"" and ""Don't U Want Me"". The melodies are uplifting and beautiful, and vocalist Kimberly's voice is silky smooth and a pleasure to the senses. If you're a true collector, you will also need to do a little digging and find the singles for ""Real Love"" and ""Brightest Star"" containing remixes by the likes of Masters At Work and David Morales, who actually manage to outdo the already flawless album versions."
4,On of the better Brannigans,"Having read Mermaid Singing, I was disappointed when I read my first Brannigan, Kickback.In Star Struck however, the characters come out more clearly, to form everyday persons with everyday feelings. One can almost feel what Brannigan feels, see what she sees. The plot is a simple one, which all the more makes it worth reading, not endless lists of characters and events. Just what I want for a rainy day, something to get me interested and intrigued. In this book, the end could be guessed, which is one of the essentials of crime stories, that you can actually be ahead of the sleuth, which Mc Dermid's shown in this novel.When I need a good, short crime story I go for a Mc Dermid!"
2,Not as good as usual,"I think Val M is one of the best crime writers, but this was a disappointment. Plot not much better than the soapopera where it takes place. Then again a bad Val is still an average normal crime story."
1,Unprofessional Warranty,"The Sunblaze t5 light carries a 5 year warranty and in 8 months when it breaks, the warranty is only a repair, NOT a replacement. So if you like being in the dark for 3 weeks I suggest you continue to buy this crap. You would think that if their product didn't even make it 8 months that they would just replace it hassle free, which is not the case. I believe there are other brands that are superior to this and they will actually take care of your issues unlike sunblaze. I would not recommend buying their products."
1,too ambitious,The author casts such a wide net he is forcedto give short shrift to recondite matters likegauge theory. This hurried romp through deepphysics leaves the reader with jumbled impressionsand occasional outright misinformation (re e.g.omission of quantum decoherence). The author isnot an expert in these fields would have been wiserto bring in a technical collaborator.
5,We Love you Blue!,"Our 3 year old son loves this game! He has been able to play it all by himself with just a little help the first couple of times. He enjoys figuring new things out each time he plays and he is progressing rapidly in his abilities to figure the computer and programs out all by himself. This a very well-developed game.I have found a wonderful teaching tool in the game that I never expected. My little son is learning to take turns talking! Since he cannot do anything on the game while the characters talk, he is learning to really listen to what they say. It is delightful! He has started really listening to what Mommy says, instead of dashing off to do something else. He is even learning to show more patience to his baby sister! I had never thought that a computer game would be teaching manners. Kudos to the programmers!"
3,Not too shabby,"The part about 14th and 15th Gen Vamps was almost as interesting as it's supposed author although the ""brief"" format is a bit unwieldy. Although I can't actually see anyone wanting to PLAY a 14/15 gen vamp the data is good resource material. If you overlook the GLARING contrast with what is written in the KoE Companion (RE: Ravnos) the last section is VERY interesting and provides a nice bit of backdrop for any campaign."
5,great deal,great price prompt shipment. Hard to find this stuff in local hardware stores due to industry changes. I will buy more from this vendor.
1,Really a bad trick,You must use the plastic coin to make this work. Work on it! You must use the plastic coin to make this work. Work on it!
5,Great trick!!,Perfect stocking stuffer. Classic low budget fun gift for kids. My son really enjoyed this simple but fun gadget. Thank you.
2,Magic Coin Slide,"I had this toy when I was a child 60 years ago and wanted one for my grandson. Mine was made out of bamboo and it still works today as well as it did back then. Not so with this plastic version. It is too loose and hard for the ""magic"" to happen. The idea is great and fun, but the quality of this item is cheap and poor for the price.."
1,Buster's Talkie Nightmare,"""Free and Easy"" (1930) is a poorly conceived ""talkie"" debut for Buster Keaton. This dreadful MGM musical-comedy desecrates Keaton's talents - the studio even has him wear clown makeup. Except for Buster's singing and dancing, there is not a memorable moment in the film. Though Keaton's MGM talkies were a mixed bag, his remaining vehicles did not plummet to the depths of ""Free and Easy."""
5,South FL Parenting,"At the end of the day, whether you are an infant or an adult, soothing music can induce much needed relaxation. Robin Spielberg's lovely instrumental album is just the ticket. This collection of piano solos covering familiar quiet time titles will make you melt into your chair. With emotion and skill, Spielberg breaths life into family favorites with fine arrangements and crystalline production of songs including ""The Inch Worm"",""Lavender Blue"" , ""The Water is Wide"", and ""You are so Beautiful"" This album will find a happy home in the nursery or in the den after the kids have gone to sleep."
5,Sexilia,"This classic needs an English DVD release. There have only been two versions, which are long out-of-print: a Japanese (AKA Sexilia) and an Italian DVD, both lacking English subtitles. And the VHS tapes are also out of print. All of Almodovar's work should be made available for fans to chart his artistic flowering. ""Labyrinth of Passion"" and ""High Heels"" are the only features missing from the series of UK boxsets (a hint for DVD distributors who cater to completists). Though they are not his best, weak Almodovar is much better than many auteurs' strongest efforts. I wonder if Almodovar is embarrassed by this work, or if it simply fell through the proverbial cracks during the DVD transfer revolution."
1,This Book is better than sleeping pills,Can't sleep? Try reading three pages of this pompous windbag's book!
3,Weekend bag,"Great size bag for a weekend . Bottom compartment provides separation for clothes or I use it for shoes . Would give the bag 5 stars ,but have a problem with arm strap popping off . I stopped using it and only use hand straps . Not a problem"
2,Not made to last,"This bag, although at first appears to be a durable bag, will not hold up to the rigors of everyday use if you carry anything other than light clothing. It might be ok for usage to the gym, but for an everyday workbag to carry lunch items, newspapers, books, and water...it won't last more than 6 months or so without showing signs of severe damage. I moved onto a Galls bag and it takes 10 times the abuse and doesn't fall apart. Try a Galls bag instead."
4,high sierra cross sport duffel,"It seems to be fine, but I have not used it yet. The size seems to be correct to go with the roll a round duffel."
4,"Sturdy gym bag, but not wowed.","I NEVER buy bags without seeing them in person, but I took a chance after spending some time on Amazon hunting for a new gym bag. I am happy with the bag after using it for a month or so, but I am not totally wowed by it. It is very sturdy with several compartments (water bottle, small zipper, wet/vented zipper area on bottom, etc.) but the main compartment isn't huge compared to the size of the bag. I keep a medium-sized train case of toiletries, flip flops, a swimsuit, a few small personal items, and maybe an extra change of clothes in it, but I haven't filled it up and stuffed it yet. The vented compartment on the bottom is fine for my swimsuit or flip flops, but I don't think it would be great for a standard size pair of sneakers.All in all, it is a good bag and I am happy with my purchase. I think buying bags/purses/luggage is a very personal thing so it is hard to recommend this to others. It seems like it will hold up for a long time, so that is good!"
5,Nice Bag,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and all of us love the quality and durability of this duffel. Thickness of the material and the quality of the zippers are great, and I imagine she will have and use this for many years. Much better than almost all the duffel bags I have seen at discount retailers, and great looking too! Highly recommend this bag."
4,Convenient and comfortable bag,"I bought this bad to consolidate bags for trips to the gym. While the bag is of modest size, it is large enough for all my things, but still fits comfortably in my gym locker. I particularly like the area on the bottom of the bag that breaths which allows me to put my swim trunks, flip-flops, and associated swim items in to dry. I think this duffel is well crafted, and a bargain at the price."
4,"Good info, basically all common sense","I had to buy this as required reading for a college course. The book is filled with practical suggestions but since I am an older student, it is all common sense. This might be good for a high schooler."
5,Ryobi Drill press spindle,"The spindle on my Ryobi drill press became slightly bent and wobbly. I found the an exact replacement on Amazon, ordered the spindle and it promptly was delivered. I installed the new spindle and it works fine for now."
3,poppy pop.,"i bought this cd after i heard the song, spaceship. spaceship was an unusual song, very ethereal and intense and the sounds melted together harmonically. this song pushed the boundaries of music and i was looking for more diverse musical talents that defied categorization.i was hoping that this cd would mimic the characteristics of spaceship but i found it rather poppy and i was disappointed. i gave the rest of the cd a chance and i realized that i knew the song, gravity, as well. good song as well, but poppy once again.the rest of the songs are good, but not what i have been looking for."
1,A Terrible Debut CD...from a promising artist.,"First I would like to say Angie Aparo is talented, has a wonderful voice, and possibilities....Aparo who also does back up vocals on matchbox twentys ""Mad Season"" has only one shining song on this CD, and that is the first single ""Spaceship"". The rest of the CD does not even fit the mood of that song.When I first heard ""Spaceship"", I thought it was orignal, new, and refreshing. So I went out and bought the album, and the rest of the songs sounded anywhere from bland to oaky country....It is obvious that his label was making him do a variety to play safe, however the safe falls into sounding anywhere from Joan Baez to James Taylor to Dwight Yoakam.What a disappointment, I played this CD a few times, tried to like it, but the only playable song was the single ""Spaceship"".Trust me on this. GRADE: F"
5,More than one minute in Wonderland,"The first time I ever saw, or heard of Angie Aparo was at an acoustic performance in a small venus. I was blown away by this man. His songwriting ability is incomparable. I got chills so many times while listening to his music. There's not one bad track on this CD, even the bonus track is amazing. His version of ""Cry"" totally outshines Faith Hill's. Besides, he wrote the song. My favorite tracks on this CD are ""Green into Gold"", ""Wonderland"", ""Hush"", ""Cry"", and the bonus track, ""The American"". I whole-heartedly recommend this CD to anyone, regardless of your musical tastes."
5,Awsome,"Angie Aparo plays a with your mind. He doesn't just want you to listen to the music, but feel it. He grabs from all aspects of life and hold them up to your heart."
5,I Love it!,"Every since my purchase of The American, I have not been able to stop listening to it. Every song is excellent! I just love it!"
5,Angie Aparo - THE AMERICAN,"Quite by chance listening to a local radio station, I heard Spaceship. Fortunately the DJ gave the info on the song - I immediately bought the CD. WOW! I like every song on this album - a MUST BUY for every music fan. Hope that he gets up to NYC."
5,This CD Saved my Life,"This album is by far the best in the world. To be honest, i really dont see how another can top this. The writing is absolutely amazing. It strikes a chord in the heart of anyone who hears this CD. I can't believe how underappreciated this album. I guess its just a classic example that the best music doesn't always sell the best. It's hard for me to even pick which is my favorite coz i really can't. omg, sorry im getting emotional, lol, just buy this album, please do it!"

1,depressing and overwrought,"I bought this as a freebie, hoping to discover an author that I would like, and was gravely disappointed. There is such a thing as erudition getting in the way of the story, and while I have no problem with a whodunit, this book is just ridiculous. Not to mention, depressing - the entire second half of the book is about death: personal, global, universal. The denoument makes no sense, either, because it simply prolongs the ultimate fate."
3,Mediocre writing + showy premise,"Usually a fan, but a somewhat tedious book unless you really enjoy quasi-hard SciFi. Science and physics appear showy and construed, writing is stilted. Malenfant emerges fully-formed as a foil and rapscalion, without any character development. I keep on thinking ""who cares"" whenever the plot involves him. I think I felt most connected to the squid. But, the book wasn't terrible either, and amusing most of the time."
1,Time you will want back,"The concept of the book had great promise; I am always facinated by books involving the manipulation of time. I liked the scientific aspects and some of the characters, but the book simply does not live up to the promise. I am sure that the author expected some oohs and aahs at the scope of this book, but I ended up simply feeling indifferent. If you buy this book you will likely want your money back. If you read it you will want the time back, but time is more easily manipulated in fiction, so don't waste your time in the first place. I would actually rate it zero stars, if that were allowed."
1,BORING!!!,"This is a short review, so bear with me. This book is VERY boring. I read some of it a year ago, so I have forgotten about it, but what I remember is that it was boring beyond imagining! I had to FORCE myself to read it, because I had paid for the stupid thing out of my own pocket, and it really was horrible..."
4,Thoughtful Sci-Fi,"When I read the Time Ships by Baxter, I was impressed by his ability to tell a story and even more impressed by his ability to explain the science behind it. This book, while being lighter on the story end than Time Ships, impressed me by going above and beyond the call of duty explaining the theoretical science involved here. It challenged me as a reader and as a science fiction fan. I found myself actually stopping at points to think about what I just read, and the implications of it all if it were true. I love both hard sci-fi and space opera...this had elements of both....a great read...but not as good as Time Ships...."
4,Great sci-fi,"The author manages to bring together the storylines of multiple characters into a book that spans parallel universes and multiple realities and timelines, and ties it all together with believable and *understandable* theories of how it all fits together. This by itself gets this book a solid 4 stars from me - it is great sci-fi writing - well thought out, researched and executed.Where is started to fall flat for me was that I just couldn't identify with any one of the characters. This may be because the style feels like a historical narrative, and that format doesn't work well for me.I'll definitely read this author again, there is great potential in his imaginings."
4,Science played out in fiction,"David Deutsch of Oxford University has said of the Universe's complexity, ""If we nudge one of these constants just a few percent in one direction, stars burn out within a million years of their formation, and there is no time for evolution. If we nudge it a few percent in the other direction, then no elements heavier than helium form. No carbon, no life. Not even any chemistry. No complexity at all.""Baxter plays out this scenario to its logical conclusion, the end of our Universe and far beyond. How would you like to save the world? Would it be enough? How about saving the Universe? The author's tightly-plotted tale has a core of realistically-depicted, three-dimensional characters (and two strong female characters just for good measure), and it's well worth a read."
1,Bad rehash of his earlier novels,"Up front, let me confess I am a complete and utter fan of Sephen Baxter and his brilliant manipulation of the constants in our Universe. But. This would have to be THE most disappointing book I have ever read by Stephen Baxter (and I thought Titan was pretty bad with no loveable characters and a gruesome plot...). In Time, Baxter starts off Ok - bit of a mixture of Voyage and some of Xeelee stuff and then suddenly, half way through the book - BAM! Total Deja Vu as it degenerates into a basic rehash of some of his previous books from the Xeelee series (although he does take into account advances in our knowledge of the universe).If you are a first time reader of Stephen Baxter, read some of his earlier stuff like Moonseed, Flux, Ring, Raft, Voyage etc!"
1,A Physics Fairy Tale - Undisciplined Writing - Cheesy,"The characters were weak, but so was the story line. Too many times I had to suspend my understanding of physics to let the author plod to the next impossible description. For example, the author seems to think that reflected light travels at infinite velocity (or very much faster than c) whereas the light coming directly at you from the event is traveling at c. (Characters are watching an expanding sphere of light from an explosion, waiting for it to hit them.) The book has many such flaws. And the characters are equally flawed and thinly portrayed. I can't recommend this book to anyone expecting hard SF, unless you want to groan a lot."
2,Marginally entertaining,"In Manifold Time, Baxter explores some great ideas that get lost in weak storytelling. I found it difficult to stomach the arrogant characters with pompous-sounding names. It's obvious that Baxter is a better scientist than a writer, although I have to admit that there are some parts of the book that manage to convey a sense of wonder that is the key to any successful sci-fi book.On a personal level, I found Baxter's world view disturbing. He seems to believe that galactic conquest is the rightful destiny of man. He portrays the lead character, Malenfant, as a savior who pioneers this new ""Manifest Destiny"". I was annoyed at how Baxter took it for granted that galactic conquest was something beneficial, without delving into any of the moral dilemmas.Perhaps that is the problem with this book--plenty of science but no humanity."
5,Yes!!! Onward!!!,"Reid Malenfant is awesome! It was great fun watching him tour the cosmos. My one gripe is the squids. Squids, really? It just seemed too far fetched, but hey, ""suspension of disbelief,"" right? In any case, I loved this book."
2,Not worth it!,"As a whole I did not enjoy this book. It was entirely too long and drawn out. There were good parts, but I found the technicality of the book too much."
2,Disappointing Trilogy Opener from Author of Moonseed,"Stephen Baxter is an award-winning author who obviously takes great care in writing his carefully researched science-fiction novels. Manifold Time is book one in a trilogy about what happens to the world when people discover that the end is in sight. It's not your standard doomsday story, however, for a number of reasons, foremost among them being the painstaking care with which Baxter presents his central thesis: that the earth is doomed not because of an iminent threat such as a comet or global nuclear war but simply because of probability.The book starts out confusing, levels out into understandable and exciting, builds to suspenseful, and then makes a disappointing decline into a long section of bewildering fluxation before finally going out with a fizzle. Hopefully books two and three in the trilogy will pick up a bit; I felt let down by the end of Manifold Time."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was terrible. The characters were lousy and I didn't care about any of them. The story was slow and boring. And the science was just too much. I know, it's supposed to be ""hard"" science fiction, but if you like it that hard, I'm sure that there are some science textbooks out there that would have a better story and much better science."
3,Second attempt...,"I bought this book several years ago and stopped reading when I reached the point where the ""enhanced"" squid idea is introduced... eh... I don't think so... I put the book down and never touched it again until now. I was determined to start over and see if I could finish it... well, I am now down to the last few pages and I have to admit that it wasn't all that bad."
2,Struggle To Finish,"Since I paid my hard earned money for this book, I was determined to finish it. (Otherwise, I would have put it down.) The science was o.k. however, the story was very weak and predictable."
2,Man is the center of all things - not!,This is an amazingly depressing novel which denies the existence of God and finds Christians to blame for virtually every bad thing that happens.There is a disturbing assumption through out this novel that we know exactly how everything works in the physical universe and that man is the most important thing to come along in this happenstance we call life.
2,Not a storyteller,"I wanted to like this book, but I couldn't even force myself to finish it. Mr. Baxter does a poor job of juggling multiple viewpoints, and as another reviewer described, the characters are ""paper thin"" - I didn't care about any of them. He rushes through everything except the science. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
3,Squids in Space!,"Interesting story, plenty of science nuggets, the timespan sequence that shows the end of the universe through Heat Death was certainly fascinating but it needs more character depth to make it a higher scoring book. The Blue Children reminded me of Nancy Kress's Beggars in Spain, but they were just sort of thrown away at the end. Well, come to think of it, so was the universe. :) I also didn't like Cornelius much."
2,Good squid!,I liked the squid. She was the best character in the book. The rest of it was more or less ok - definitely not something I would keep. Check it out of the library and save yourself the money. A good airplane book.
5,Whew! Felt like I was part of the action!,"Not having read Stephen Baxter's novels before, I took this one up by chance. The book grabbed my attention from the start and kept my attention throughout the book...none of the usual 'setting the stage'. A must read for hardcore science fiction fans of any genre!"
3,Too much of a good thing is not that good,"This book has interesting ideas. I love science fiction and I read a lot of scientific magazines. This novel gave me the idea that the author picked a bunch of recently published scientific theories and built a story around it. The afterword confirmed what I suspected. As others wrote, the execution is not really great and characters are unidimentional. I also think there were too many scientific ideas that were forcefully connected together with a poor story. A bit more focus might have helped the story. I found the conclusion quite interesting, but the path to get there was not that great. Another reviewer that really like this story mentioned that Baxter reminds him of Robert J. Sawyer. I do not agree. It was my first Bazter novel and I much prefer Sawyer's novels because he focuses on less elements but develop these better."
3,Mindboggling for the sake of mindboggling isn't storytelling,"Great concept, rotten characters I could care less about. A mind is aterrible thing to waste when you don't have characters, or for that matter writing talent, to pull it off. TIME SHIPS was a much better story."
2,Just didn't get there for me ...,"After reading the excellent Moonseed the first sci-fi book to get my attention for a long time - I was really looking forward to this book. But my hopes were dashed I'm afraid. This book is manifestly dull and depressing from the get-go.The overall story - the need to discover the true nature of humanities future in order to avoid the ""Carter Catastrophe"" - a self-fulfilling portent of doom - results in a book that at once expands into the broadest of scales (the future of the Universe) while getting stuck in the merest details of the characters involved.Baxter proved that he can write page-turning midnight-oil-burning sci-fi with Moonseed which combined science, science-fiction and Tom Clancy. It's a pity that this performance wasn't reproduced in this book."
2,confuses scale with depth,much less than compelling characters. the truths described in the book make little sense and have other easier explanations. in short. big ideas but trite.
2,"Anyhow, An OK read - Anyhow","If you like the word 'anyhow', then this is the book for you. Ignoring the conclusions drawn from the scantest of evidence, the repeated misuse of 'anyhow' will drive any 'anyhow' word lover wild, anyhow.Anyhow, I did manage to struggle through to the end which, for me, indicates a reasonable read. Unfortunately all the 'anyhows' lost this book a couple of rating stars, anyhow."
3,Adequate entertainment,"It's a decent book, enjoyable but not great.He uses the word ""regolith"" a LOT."
4,Good storytelling but not all too original,"I like Stephen Baxter. He's one of those sci-fi writers who knows that storytelling is as essential in Sci-Fi as is good science. And Time is really told well; the plot moves at a fair pace, and the writing keeps making you come back for more. It is definetly one of his better books in terms of the way it is told. But what it fails is in the actual science itself. I am an avid science boff, and I really found this book lacking in it's explainations of the things it depicts. It felt like I was in a Sci-Fi movie; the plot and all are good, but there is no real scince in there (except for the occasional mention of 'quark nuggets')"
1,A sadly lacking premise to the story,"I have enjoyed many of Stephen Baxter's books in the past. This one, however, just does not measure up. Statistically showing the world must soon end: Come on, is that the best that he could come up with to get the the book started?. Nevertheless, I read on hoping that I could just suspend disbelief. I was mostly successful, but then got bogged down with characters explaining science to me every 2 pages. Maybe if you know no physics that part is interesting. I found it useless, and typically skipped whole paragraphs that were science tutorial monologs.I'm about to start Manifold: Space. Hopefully it will be better."
1,wasted potential,"The beginning of the book was quite engrossing, but the plot kept wandering all over the place. When the story suddenly, and unexpectedly, started talking about some super-intelligent squid, I quit. Any interest I had in continuing the book was gone."
3,Hagen products,"I have two aquaclear70 filters and I love them, they work great and have a good output. But they have their flaws. One main one is you got to check your motors when you buy one of these filters. It seems they tend to have the shaft in them that holds the impeller bend to one side to far causing the impeller to hit against it causing damage to the filter. I love the filters but over time Hagen has let them slip away with careless assembly. I wish they could at least take the time to be detail oriented instead of amount of production."
1,do not buy it from this selling again!!,"when I got the package, the motor unit is in a bag full of dust. It seems like had been used. Sure enough, it did not work. I usually have a good experience with Amazon but not this time."
2,A collection of essays. Outdated and mostly useless,"Got this book for a research paper. Only half the book is actual information about the prison system. The other half is information about specific prisons. That 50% that is relevant is a collection of essays on each aspect of the federal prison system. Woefully outdated and scant in its description. Information on the Washington-view of prison bureaucracies is in there, but you can forget finding the inside view of the prison system itself. There's very little about what an inmate does on a day to day basis, how they interact with prison staff, and the rules and regulations they must abide by. All in all a bad book."
4,Priced Right for the '70's Obsessives'...,"I like this CD because I get a very good classic soul mix, and I get to save a few dollars from not having to purchase a box set or anthology mix for the tunes I want to hear. For example, this is one of the few CDs that has that Jerry Butler/Brenda Lee cut ""Ain't Understanding Mellow?"" (a 'blue lights in the basement' track around here) that ain't in some [price] greatest hits compilation. I get The Commodores ""Sweet Love"" and Luther Ingram's classic ""(If Loving You is Wrong) I don't Want to Be Right"" on one CD. And I get the Ahhh-hah! without chasing down the right time they play certain of these jams on the classic R and Bee radio station here. Like, they seldom play that nice ""Misty Blue"" by Dorothy Moore. Well, I don't have to wait till the station decides to play it...."
2,The worst of Miles,"This gets my vote as Miles' worst pre-electric recording date. It's one of the most desultory jazz recording sessions ever made. All the tunes are done slowly to highlight Miles' lyricism, but everything is so draggy that he just sounds bored. Elvin Jones, a great modern drummer, is totally handcuffed. Also, the CD is a major ripoff (even as it was on LP): we get only 27 minutes of music (which, come to think of it, might be a blessing in disguise: the less of this music the better). For die-hard Miles fans only (and then to only hear him at his worst)."
1,NEVER BUY DIGITAL JAZZ!! = GARBAGE!!,"Jazz will never sound as it should when mastered on a digital format. Analog vinyl LP's or magnetic tape (as a distant second) is the best way to go. You will NEVER know what you are missing out on without a decent turntable and tube amplifier. Try listening to Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue"" or Kenny Drew's ""Undercurrent"" mp3 album and then find someone who owns it on vinyl and listen... you will never buy another cd or mp3 again and you may want a refund for all those mp3's you bought. Digital jazz is garbage and should only be used while jogging or when not really paying attention to the music (i.e. mowing your lawn)."
4,Good Miles.,"One of Miles' poorer efforts, Blue Moods was a misunderstood creature. Miles had a great band set up, but nothing really seemed to come as crisp as his other work from that period. Still, ""Nature Boy"", and ""Easy Living"" are great masterful performances from Miles. ""Alone Together"" is a bit aimless. This is a fine album, though, for tracks 1 and 4."
2,"Extended long play club versions my foot--or 12""...","rebound NEVER comes through completely with their promise. there is barely a 12"" version on this volume, as with most, and a number of 12"" edits. Track times are:1. don't you want me (5:35) (remix edit)2. the right stuff (4:28)3. c'mon and get my love (3:51)4. you keep me hanging on (4:12)5. lovergirl (4:45)6. pull up to the bumper (5:48)7. the glamorous life (6:38) (The 12"" edit, not the full album version)8. in my house (5:01)9. everybody dance (5:44)10. word up (6:02)11. you dropped a bomb on me (5:13)12. solid (5:06) (album version with the acapella intro-not the 12"" version)"
4,finally !,"finally grace jones ""pull up to the bumper"" the 12 inch version on cd!, Sheila E also in the long version.Not all the songs are ok, but for this price you should buy it only for Grace Jones & Sheila E."
4,Does the trick.,"I ordered this product not for use as a bread drawer, but because I live in a nearly 200 year old house that seems to welcome mice, no matter what we do. I use this drawer to protect my utensils from the mice. And it does work!Admittedly, the product is nothing special. It is only a pair of runners and a sheet of plastic, and I suppose someone particularly handy could fabricate one themselves. Installation requires cutting the plastic to size, attaching the runners, and that's about it. In our case, there was insufficient clearance for the runners, so the sides of the drawers had to be sanded down a bit -- hence the 4 star rating.I can't attest to the product's capacity as a bread drawer, but it does block rodents from my utensils, and for that, job well done."
3,DVD,This DVD kept freezing when I was watching it. None of my other DVDs do this. The movie itself was great.
4,Bodyguard,Great movie good streamingWill look forward to renting another video from here. Just don't play so good on cell phone
3,Whitneys Best Movie,"It was an intresting movie. If you like Whitney Houston you will love this movie. It had controvercial matter about an interacial couple and it was a movie symbolic of the early 1990's. I did not find it a great movie, but it wasnt a bad movie either. Whitney Houston has several great songs from this movie and album and she was in her prime before she got seriously hoooked on the drug and alchol additiction. She was a beautiful preformer and person"
4,Great movie,"If you like romance and suspence, you will love this movie. The voice of Whitney Houston is so beautiful. I could listen to it all day long."
5,Classic Whitney!,I love watching the action and passion in this film. This is a classic that everyone should own! Let's not forget about one of the most famous covers of all time...I Will Always Love You!
4,"""Good Romantic & Edgy Drama!""","Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston star in this 1992 romantic drama.An Ex-Secret Service agent gets involved with a pop singer he's hiredto protect. I've always enjoyed this film and Kevin and Whitney weregreat together. This dvd has good picture and sound plus a making-of documentary, music video and trailer. I recommend this goodromantic & edgy drama."
1,Bad buy,Too bad this DVD is in francais and doesn't even play on America/north American equiptment!!!! I would return it but it's too much of an inconvenience. C'est Dommage
4,Finally! The Diva Herself on Widescreen,"But this IS NOT a 2 disc set. I enjoyed this movie so much, but always wanted to see it in widescreen. Now, after many, many years Warner has graced us with one. Kevin Costner is the bodyguard, a role I would like to see him do again. There is a good sequel in there somewhere, but we don't really need Whitney. She's OK, well, she's playing herself really. The musical numbers are great, the soundtrack is superb! (Even that over, over, overplayed song ""I'll Always Love You."" I had the first edition on DVD, and this new one has better sound and higher picture quality. If you watch this film often, treat yourself and upgrade to this special edition. Also features a new documentary on the making of the film."
2,The bodyguard,"Missing the beautiful ending of her singing the great song, etc. Dissapointing!!That was the biggest reason I wanted this and I am dissapointed in it."
4,Entertaining,"Overall It's a good and entertaining movie although a little cheesy at points. Contains a good combination action, suspense and drama."
5,What's not to Love,"I love this movie! Great push-pull romance. Classic Whitney Houston voice. Perfecto!I remember when this movie first came out and people were doubting Whitney's acting ability, I was so glad she proved the critics wrong."
3,Had to have it,"When Whitney Houston passed,I had to have this movie. I hate Costner's hair and the acting's not great(or good)and there are so many things wrong and predictable about this movie,but when I hear the song I just have to watch this movie. I never was a huge fan,but the song lives forever in this movie for me.If you love it,you have to own it."
1,Very Wack PURPLE RAIN LITE!,this film is PURPLE RAIN LITE.the story Line is as bad as the music here.i don't know what's more overated the film or the soundtrack? it's about a tie for such Lameness.Whitney can't Act.Kevin Costner is just going thru the motions.no Chemistry.Whitney is Nice Looking&kevin Costner is suppose to be a Leading Man why No real ROmance? was WHitneys Skin a Little too DARK? that alone would have made this film at least half way believable.but instead we get VIdeos called a Movie.Prince did that already with Purple Rain.this is the Lite version of that.and it's not Good.
5,Great,You must whatch this movie more than one time because you will find parts that you will love to see over and over again .
5,Love and mystery,"This is a true classic. The bodyguard protects the singing star from a serious threat from an unknown person. Kevin Costner plays the bodyguard as a serious, careing, highly skilled professional bodyguard hired by one of the singer's people.Whitney Houston, the singer is initially scornful of the need for the bodyguard and fights against the restrictions to her life that he imposes. Eventually they fall in love, the threat becomes real and is overcome in a dramatic climax scene. Houston's singing (I will always love you, etc.) is outstanding. She is glamerous; he's a hunk. It's a movie to watch over and over."
4,Great 90s Guilty Pleasure,"This movie is a nice, little relic of the 90s. Kevin Costner gives a stunning performance. Whitney is also great. The music is great. Onscreen, the chemistry between the two is tangible. Great 90s throwback."
3,oops!!,"I saw this movie when it first came out and was really disappointed. I don't really understand why in the last 20yrs.Hollywood thinks that because you are an recording artist or an athlete, that you somehow are and actor. To me an actor is someone that causes you to forget you are watching an actor or a movie and you get caught up in the plot. If you got caught up in this acting you must watch a lot of cartoons. Along with Waterworld, this has to be one of Kevin's flops. I'm sorry Whitney is gone, she had a great voice, but like Diana Ross , she should have stuck to singing and left the acting to professionals."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT!,"The much hyped film, released in 1992 features two very bright talents but to my surprise (and in my own personal opinion of course) is rather lacklustre. The story often careers along on a soap opera, t.v movie type level, with no real chemistry between the two leading stars. To its credit though the soundtrack is magnificent with Houston singing such great tracks as, I HAVE NOTHING and I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU with all her heart and soul. The main trouble is that its plot is somewhat predictable, giving very little in the way of suspense but in all fairness there are a few surprising twists to the story but overall the film is at best, enjoyably about average."
1,Warning: This movie is full-screen format w/ a bad transfer,"Most of the DVD review Web sites blasted this release for the lousy quality of the transfer. Somewhat odd for Warners to give it so little attention when you consider what a hit it was. But I guess they are doing the usual ""double-dipping"" of releasing a lousy version first and then making fans purchase a new edition that is cleaned up down the road. Most strange of all is that it's a full-screen cropped pan and scan transfer. I guess there are some people who will consider buying full-screen movies with part of the image chopped off (not to mention what they'll be stuck with when HD wide-screens come into wide use by 2006. But it's a real shame that they don't offer a widescreen alternative. Though to be honest, until they produce a less grainy version, I won't be buying it."
1,Horror of progress,"I love the movie , for years, but trough amazon video it is terrible. Sounds delays as long as 3-5 sec, so you see they open a mouth ,you expect to hear your loved song but you hear a voice of the other men. Really got you nervious . Few times it was freezing , tried to finish next day- the same .I feel sorry , next time 'll rent at blockbuster."
1,"Love the movie, hate the SDH (Subtitles for Deaf and Hard of Hearing)","The reason why I gave it a one star, it's because of the SDH (Subtitles for Deaf and Hard of Hearing). It only subtitles the dialogues. No subtitling on singings at all. That makes no sense at all. Not worth the buy if it only subtitles dialogues."
3,The Bodyguard (Special Edition),I still love this movie no matter how many times I watch it. However on the QUALITY of this dvd; I am a bit dissapointed - it froze on a particular sceen - that one where Whitney Houston performed on stage in front of a rowdy crowd. The scene kept on freezing no matter what I did. I had to skip the entire scene to finish the rest of the movie.
3,Could have been a great movie...,"...if there had been some sort of detectable chemistry between Kevin and Whitney. The love story didn't make sense.The story around the love story was good, though; Kevin's character definitely some internal issues against which he continually battles (and loses). He believes he must remain detached and stoic to be an effective bodyguard. As a former secret service agent, he feels guilt over not preventing the shooting of President Reagan while being at his mother's funeral. His triumph over these issues comes at the end when he saves his ""love"" from death."
5,The Bodyguard DVD,I was thrilled to find the DVD of the wonderful moviestaring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner entitledThe Bodyguard. I bought it brand new at a veryreasonable cost immediately following the tragicdeath of Whitney Houston. Thank You Amazon!!!
2,The BodyGuard,"The movie looks and feels like a bad reproduction. Started watching the movie and half way through it, lines and scratches started to appear. Glad I only paid $8.00 for the movie, but that was still too much. Would think twice before I order a movie again from this website."
2,Too Dark,"Great movie, but this DVD shows up way too dark. It was frustrating in certain scenes to barley see all that was going on. I have seen this movie in the theater and on TV, all were fine but not the DVD.I would not recommend this movie on DVD."
5,Great Movie,"This was the first time I watched the movie from beginning to end. It was great with suspense, action and love."
2,A waste of time,I don't like any Kevin Costner film I've ever seen. I'm lucky I did not have to pay to see it.
4,could do without the foul language,enjoyed the movie otherwise. Acting was excellent. Great action and suspense. But could do without the foul language. I would recommend it.
2,Disappointed,The movie quality is poor. Definitely not hi-def. You are better of saving your money and getting it on the Kevin Costner movie 4-pack that is available on dvd.
4,THE BODYGUARD (SPECIAL EDITION),"You will love Kevin Costner's best movie. He plays Frank, who bodyguards Rachel (played by Whitney Houston), who is threatened by some pyshco. This movie will lift you in high spirits the sme Whitney Houston's first 4 albums did! It features her #1 smash, I WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU. Plus I HAVE NOTHING and others."
2,Average film with superior soundtrack,"It's a film which soundtrack better than movie itself!So,if you wanna buy this,why don't go for music instead?"
3,Just the same old movie,"Looks like they put the same movie on bluray without any improvement process for the image. The image is not for HD TV, it is a shame. The bluray extras are just ok."
5,Farewell Whitney,"The Bodyguard is a great movie and the soundtrack shot the movie into the stratosphere. As for Whitney Houston, as a fan of yours since your debut album in 1985, I can only say thank you for creating music that has been the soundtrack of not only my life but of many others as well. I wish you a peaceful journey. Rest in peace."
4,great movie,"I recently purchased the bodyguard movie, I have to be honest that when Whitney Houston passed away I wanted this movie very much. When this movie 1st came out back in 1992 I went to see it and the next day I had to have the sound track, the music was incredible Whitney Houston singing how can you not want the movie and sound track. For what ever reason I never bought the movie, anyway now that I have it thanks to Amazon.com, I'm very happy. Anyone who is a Whitney Houston fan should have this movie in their collection. Purchasing from Amazon.com was very easy and user friendly. I will make more purchases in the future on Amazon.com."
5,Fabulous Keepsake,One of the best movies ever made. Had to have it for family archives. Classic love story with two of the best actors ever in the movie industry.
3,What????,"This is a decent enough film, particularly considering its genre (romantic thriller as superstar vehicle). Literate writing, some nifty and very effective plot twists, good portrayals all around. But...Did anybody notice they used *both* possible endings? There's ""the bodyguard turns his back on happiness and goes on to do his duty with a stiff upper lip"" and there's ""the singer turns back at the last minute and flings herself into his arms"" ending, and I'll be damned if they're not both used, one after the other. The technical term for this is a ""contradiction"", something you want to avoid in a narrative, particularly at the climax. I've never seen this particular trick used before. I'm sure I never want to see it again. Call it a three-and-a-half."
3,GOOD ENTERTAINING MOVIE,I AM ONE OF WITHNEY HOUSTON'S FAN ; BUT I HAVE TO BE REALISTIC THSI MOVIE IS NOT EXCELLENT OR SUPERB OR EXCEPTIONAL ; IT IS JUST A GOOD ENTERTAINING MOVIE : VERY GOOD MUSIC & SONGS ; OK STORY & THAT'S IT...
2,Shlock,"This was a silly vehicle for Whitney to sell albums, which she did for some reason or other. A tale of lust (and greed) and not of love."
3,I FELT GYPPED,"This fairly good suspense films cries out for a Hollywood ending but alas, we don't get one. In the frst of the last two scenes, the pop singer (Whitney Houston) gives her boduygaurd (Kevin Kostner) a great big smooch and I thought they would then depart on her private plane together. Not so, however, since in ther last scene we see him gaurding another person (a governor no less)."
5,THEY JUST DON'T DONT MAKE 'EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE! - OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY!,"THE BODYGUARDTHIS IS SUCH A GOOD MOVIE. THE MORE I WATCH IT THE MORE MORE I APPRECIATE EVERY ASPECT OF THIS FILM. WHITNEY'S ACTING DEBUT PROVED THAT SHE IS REALLY A COMPLETED, WELL-ROUNDED ARTIST, COUPLED WITH HER AMAZING VOCAL ABILITY - SHE IS A ONCE IN A LIFETIME STAR.I WILL ALWAYS TREASURE THIS FILM."
5,WOW!,"Wow, just wow! Fantastic movie, fantastic acting by all characters played. Love Kevin Costner, but after learning of Whitney's death today, someone told me about this movie. I've always been a fan of her voice and music, but I don't know how I never heard of this movie before today. Anyway, I looked it up here on Amazon Prime movies to watch. Really moving story, with a lot of suspense. I literally cried at the end. Watching it after her passing, just made it more emotional for me. Whitney... such an exceptionally and naturally beautiful woman, who proved to be a great actress as well... one with a heavenly voice. RIP Whitney, you will be sorely missed. You were taken from us too soon. You were too young to leave us. You will be missed, but your music will live forever in the world, and in our hearts. Beautiful lady, be at peace now, and sing along with the angels. Prayers of comfort for your precious daughter and family."
3,Whitney Houston?,"This film really stretches credulity with it's weak plot, but the action is fair.At least you sort of get Whitney Houston in her prime, before Bobby Brown and the drugs. Not an actress, but a fabulous singer, she is miscast.Kevin Costner does his best to generate heat between them, but Whitney gives the impression that she is reading her love lines over his shoulder.I bought this DVD used at a really low price, so I can't say I'm super disappointed.You do the same."
4,DVD's on Amazon are much cheaper,We buy a lot of our DVD's on Amazon.........the deals are great and the selection is amazing.
4,The Bodyguard Special Edition,"I loved the music soundtrack when it first came out. I don't know why I waited so long to buy. It answered my curiosity about stardom. I had no idea what can happen, and what a fast paced and crazy life you live if you are in the spotlight. Whitney is wonderful and I fell in love with her all over again. Kevin was wonderful and he takes his bodyguard job seriously and tries not to get too personal and stay professional. The casting was right on, and the music perfectly fits the story. Buy this movie and enjoy.Debra Envall"
5,THE BODY GUARD DVD,AFTER WHITNEY'S DEATH I WANTED SOMETHING TO REMEMBER HER AND THE DVD AND CD'S I RECEIVED FROM AMOZON WAS SPEEDY AND GREAT VALUE...ALL WORKED AND EVER LASTING PLEASED WITH YOUR SERVICE
4,My wife loves it!,"My wife is satisfied so a bit costly but she thinks it was worth it. I on the other hand feel that to not have the DVD in our possession is like renting a car from Hertz, only difference we can pick the car up and drive it at anytime but we cannot keep it in our garage."
5,movie,this movie has the best music and have always loved the story - the wasa good value for the $$
1,dvd,"This dvd will only play for half of the movie,that it comes up this disk can not be played, it is a piece of trash,they should ban this seller from selling their junk"
5,Put the Peg into the Hole,"This book is a comprehensive survey of the kinds of psychological testing available in 1972. Under each section, you get a full-page example of the most significant test question and a write-up on what it is supposed to do. Want to know what the academic and corporate categorizers were up to in 1972?"
2,pass,"Serialism destroyed many a talented composer. Searle seems to have been one of them. The sound is very good, an the unappealling notes can be heard very clearly."
2,big price difference between tablet and softgel versions,"The 120 softgel version is almost 50% more expensive than the tablet version. I thought I was getting a good deal by ordering the tablet version, having bought the softgel version previously. But the nutrition label of the tablet bottle, even though yielding the same 2mg Astaxanthin as the softgel bottle, shows a very different amount of the raw materials ( Haematococcus pluvialis algae extract ) used to make the 2mg Astanxanthin, than the softgel bottle label. I asked Source Naturals about this big difference via email but they never replied. In addition, the softgel version indicates ""AstaREAL"" but the tablet version does not. So one has to be careful to examine the differences between a softgel and tablet version of the same supplement supplied by the same supplier."
5,Highly recommend !!! Dr. Mercola also highly recommends this product !!,Check out Dr. Mercolas reviews on his website at www (dot) Mercola (dot) com about Astaxanthin ... I take this every day ... help improve vision and health ... one of the most powerful nutrients on planet earth. Money well spent.
5,"Superb, most romantic music","My wife and I both fell in love with this wonderfully romantic CD. Ms. Avora has an unparallelled voice, crisp, clear, and comes from the depth of her heart. This CD is a pure treasure."
3,Great singing but not enough variety,"Ms. Evora manages to make every song sound the same to a non-speaker and new listener. Amazon recommends Lhasa to listeners of Evora. I prefer Lhasa, at the moment."
1,Lacking in All the Fine Points,"It is unfortunate that this type of poor pastiche is allowed to be published. For example, in the first story, the murder weapon is a vial of ""Liquid Nitrogen"" into which a copper coil is dipped. After 3 days, the vial is still steaming. Any 4th grade student knows Nitrogen exists as a liquid only under high pressure, and is not going to sit around in a glass vial.In addition, the grammar and spelling is atrocious! Perhaps my guess at the work being of a 4th grade level is not so far off.One of the worst of many Sherlock Holmes pastiches I have read."
3,Not For The Purest Holmes Fans,"Since we can no longer add to the original 56 stories written by Conan Doyle, we have to accept and be somewhat pleased with anyone who attempts to keep the Sherlock Holmes name in the limelight and allows us to sink into the Victorian Era for ever so short periods of time. I thank the author for that.This book is not for the pure Holmes fan. It appears to be more of light-hearted attempt at writing some Holmes stories (something that most Holmes followers have done). This is a self-published book (since it is iUniverse) and that must be taken into consideration. A couple of the stories are pretty good and it states this is the author's first book so take it for what it's worth. For entertainment, it's fine."
1,Publishing Mystery of the Electronic Age,"This is dreadful. The book is full of typos and grammatical errors, the author is apparently ignorant of all but the barest outlines of British society, and the solutions to the mysteries are absurd."
4,"a balanced, thorough, useful guide to limnology","Typical of the Golden Guides, this book is written for audiences of all age levels, from elementary school through college. The style and tone are appealing and allow the reader to seek any level of depth. The drawings and illustrations provide useful complementary information to the text. Somehow, the author has managed to make the phylogenetic and zoological information accessible to a general reader. This book would be equally at home on the shelf of a middle school student taking his first biological sciences class or a college student studying limnology or stream ecology. Information on identification of organisms is generally sufficient, but not overbearing. Some of the material is dated, such as the use of the phylum name Coelenterata rather than Cnidaria, but the nonexpert will be unaffected by this. As an added bonus, the Golden Guides are priced extremely attractively."
2,Tripp Lite NS2000SR Portable Notebook Stand,"Fan was non-functioning out of the box. USB hub worked correctly. Stand is stable and flexible due to extensible rear legs. Tripp Lite limited warranty is essentially worthless as it requires you call for a return authorization, then you must ship the product back to them at your expense."
3,"Good movie, the book was better","I enjoyed watching Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway bring one of my favorite books to the big screen but I was disappointed that the ending shifted from the ending in the book and the Lily character was not developed more. Very entertaining though and if you haven't read the book, you'll love the movie."
2,A Tedious Morality Play,"This is a movie billed as a comedy, though it is rarely entertaining, much less funny. Streep is a brilliant performer, and Tucci makes a stereotype (one of many in the film) tolerable. It is hard to determine if this is intended as a straightforward comedy with some sort of message, or a message story with some hint of comedy. Either way, it comes across as a ham-handed story sodden with every kind of platitude imaginable about salt of the earth virtue despoiled by the pernicious effects of vanity and power. Perhaps if the whole thing had been done as a cartoon it would not be so grating. By the end of the movie my head was pounding and I wanted all of these cardboard cutout characters with their paint by number lines to just go away. This may be an interesting film to those who enjoy fantasizing about the world of high fashion, but if that doesn't strike you as interesting, I would not recommend investing time or money in seeing it."
2,"Not a total bomb, but not great either","Meryl Streep looks like she's have a great time getting to act so vicious, and somehow she manages to make her character believable throughout. I figure Anne did the movie for the free high-fashion clothing. I was highly disappointed in Anne's main character. They try to show her character has spunk and drive and faithfulness, but she just took the abuse too long for my liking, and her one-night stand was too easily passed over. Not a total bomb of a movie, but not all that great either."
4,Good Movie,Great movie! Love Meryl Streep in her role! She does a perfect job playing a villain with such poise and sophistication! Anne Hathaway is also great!
2,Overhyped & overrated,"A normal girl gets ground and digested by a weird job for a weird person and comes out normal again - sort of. There are three indications in the end that our girl is back to normal (sort of), she tells the new guy she just slept with that she is ""not his baby,"" she tosses her cellphone in the water (i.e. quits her work for the weirdo), and says ""sorry"" to her original boyfriend.End of story.Someone who shops for wardrobe at Sam's Club and Target, or even Kohls and Sears, and is happy with it, may not appreciate too much of this film. ;)Five stars for acting, one for nonstop fashion show, and four negative for unengaging and pointless story, overall: two stars."
4,The Devil Wares Prada,Over-all a great movie and cast. As always Meryl Streep pulls off a great job in her roll as a ruthless executive.
5,Great Movie...,I love this story. So do my girls and their friends. I think this will be a classic down the road.
2,Chic flick my chic hated,"After much encouragement from my chic, we watched this boring flick. It was like watching the same scene over and over again. The devil was one-dimensional, the protagonist was weak. One good point- my chic said I could choose the next three movies."
4,Just Fun Entertainment,"I really did not expect to like this movie but I found most of it enjoyable. In both acting and appearance, Meryl Streep was just remarkable. I wish she had been in even more of the scenes but you do see her in most of them. Ann Hathaway was also terrific but I did not care for the casting of her boyfriend. Somehow he just didn't fit. Can't say the ending is a huge surprise but if you are looking for a just plain fun movie to watch some evening, this is it. This will probably inspire you to check on the web and see who this was maybe, sort of, could have been based on. You will find the articles interesting!"
4,Nice chick flick,"Yes, it's a chick flick, but a good one. Merryl Streep does a very good job in her role as the aforementioned 'devil', while Anne Hathaway plays the new assistant/intern who has to deal with the devil, who is a very strict, demanding, and at times, outright hostile/mean woman. Streep especially shines in her role and carries it well."
3,"Lovely movie, rotten message.","So this should be sub-titled ""A cautionary tale for girls"". The basic message seems to be ""don't be ambitious, girls, it'll make you miserable and bitter and nobody will like you or be close to you. Be content with smaller things and don't dream big, it's too scary out there."" Either that or ""Don't change who you are inside for the high life, don't betray your friends, it's morally wrong and makes you into a bad person who doesn't like or recognize herself and it's not worth it"".One of those messages should be listened to by all those silly girls desperately wearing the aggressively trashy clothing and excessive bling; the other is a crock of bad beans.Aside from that it's a wonderful movie and I enjoyed it immensely."
5,What is not to love,This movie was so delightful with Meryl Streep and the looks she gave... I can not imagine anyone else doing that movie... Her lines were great but the sighs and glances took the cake...
3,fun to watch,"This is the movie based on the best-selling book of the same title by Lauren Weisberger. Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci all do a marvellous job in their roles. Of course, Hollywood sees fit make a few significant changes from the book: Andrea's best friend isn't alcoholic, Andrea takes Emily's place in Paris under different circumstances, and Hollywood makes Miranda Priestly NICER than in the book, especially towards the end. Fun to watch."
5,Instant streaming - Devil Wears Prada,"The video streamed with no glitches, pauses or buffering. It was clear and played like a DVD. We enjoyed it very much."
5,Amazing movie.,"The Devil Wears Prada is an amazing movie. For people who like stories about underdogs, fashion, or just like the actors in the movie... Watch this movie! I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it."
1,"Great film, but use Netflix","Great film, but use Netflix to rent movies. Netflix response time is phenomenal. You don't have to buy DVDs anymore."
1,The Devil Wears Prada,Excellant movie. Saw it on the circuit. The reason I give it 1 star is because the wide screen does not work in South Africa. A freind of mine bought the full screen version and it works.RegardsKurt.
1,THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA IS THE WORST MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i saw this movie the day it came out. It was the dumbest movie i ever seen. It is
5,the devil wears prada?,"a flim i must see along with these other flims lil man,tailgetta lights,you me and dupree,and my must see movie of the year jhon tucker must die!"
2,Not too many cliche's but still a mess,"Streep is a genius. Tucci gives flesh to what could have been a""Will & Grace"" character, thanks Stanley. There are bosses out there in the corporate world that appear to be just insane but know what it takes to stay at the top. All this is handled well with the movie however the personal lives of the young assistant and here boyfriend are just not interesting and rely on obvious plot devices to get them from point A to point B."
1,UGH!,"I was so excited to see this movie and it was a complete disappointment. It depicted the disgusting-ness of the fashion world and Anne Hathaway's character's change from a grounded, intelligent, beautiful girl into a fashion obsessed, shallow, ugly, pathetic caricature (much like those girls we see in the tabloid magazines). Meryl Streep had a great performance (she allegedly played Anna Wintour to a tee)- its just too hard to find fault with one of the finest American actresses. However, despite her performance, the movie was just too predictable, empty and disappointingly cheesy."
3,Meryl Streep nominated for Best Actress in this film - get real!,"""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a slight comedy set within the world of high fashion.Meryl Streep plays the head of a fashion magazine and Anne Hathaway her new assistant. How Meryl Streep managed to get a Best Actress nomination for a role in this film beggars belief. Anne Hathaway is quite cute but somebody with a bit more spunk could have made more out of it e.g. Kirsten Dunst.The undemanding, inoffensive plot and the casting of Hathaway would lead one to believe the filmmakers were trying to appeal to the ""Princess Bride"" audience of Hathaway rather than the ""adult"" audience of Streep.Yet more formula entertainment from the Hollywood production line."
3,devil wears prada,didnt like it as much as the book..but it was enjoyable anyway.Meryl Streep is wonderful.
1,Weak fashion show with touches of almost-humor,"The reason I purchased this movie was because Meryl Streep is in it. I assumed that she would add enough to the movie to make it worth watching. However, her part is seriously underwritten. Mostly, she strikes poses in a flat characterization of the bitch-boss. The majority of screen time is focused on the heroine, played by Anne Hathaway, who has not a comedic bone in her body. The supporting characters are no better, in that the talented ones are underwritten and the rest are just plain dull."
2,"Over Promise, Under Deliver",Much praise was given to this less then interesting film. A two hour waste of time unless you are looking for something that won't require the use of any brain cells while viewing.
5,"Woman's work,the real thing...","This is the Mother of all ""Women's Work"" movies and the very best,truely on mark corporate eyeful. I loved this film for the story, the idenitfiability of the characters among your own peers and the wise life lessons portrayed in a real, not sticky, way. I left with the illusion of understanding how people might get to the top and stay there and how other decisions based in values could help redirect your life. All the kinds of love are there as well,passion,devotion,acceptance,loyalty,wicked and good stuff."
5,Hilarious!,"Just loved this movie! This was the movie to watch this summer, the acting from all the stars was just top notch. Meryl Streep was divine as the ""boss from hell"", Emily Blunt was so perfect for her role, Anne Hathaway, was wonderfully cast as the ""I don't like fashion, but want to be a journalist"" and finally, Stanley Tucci was so over the top, but also very wise and just the nicest gay man you could ever want to work with. This movie proved that good writing, great acting and a very appealing cast does not need a 120 million dollar budjet to be entertaining and memorable. Grab this while you can!"
4,Meryl Streep delivers,"Ok I give it 3 1/2 stars. Totally predictable film. But charming in its own way. The character ""Andrea"" reminds me of Audrey Hepburn. Say what you want about Meryl Streep but she totally is great here, and you forget it is even Meryl Streep and believe she is the hard biting career driven woman that she portrays in the film. It also makes one think about ambition versus love. However, the ""other lover"" storyline was totally unnecessary and who would leave their cutie pie boyfriend for that self centered monster?"
3,Blu-ray quality,The video quality is outstanding on a 1080p plasma but don't look to hear 5.1 audio. It may say 5.1 but all I heard was 2.0 the entire movie. Not impressive at all. Even outdoor scenes in busy traffic could have been enhanced with surround sound from the rear speakers but there wasn't any. You'd be better off upscaling the DVD version at a cheaper price.
3,"Enjoyable, but ...","... flawed by its inclusion of the usual cliches - missing significant other's birthday party because the boss needs you to do something actually relatively important, for instance - what kind of a choice is that? Does that really show that the protaganist is circling the drain? What is she supposed to choose? Is Hollywood insane? The self-righteous friends and requisite token minorities are also included. Except for the Asian contingent. They need to complain more, I suppose.But it's an otherwise entertaining look at the world of fashion and fashion publishing, with Streep as a driven taskmaster whose every whim is catered to. This she plays to perfection. Stanley Tucci is endearing as the mentor figure. And the part of the ""number one"" aide is played to comedic perfection, especially a hilarious head-shaking response."
1,"""Ugly Betty"" does it better","I had very low expectations when I rented this and the outcome was this was worse than expected. Not funny one little bit, horrible to annoying acting ALL around, though Meryl was functional as the mean lady cartoon character. What pizazz Meryl did manage to convey only made the other little ingenues seem all the more like high school drama class rejects. There was nothing interesting in this bland, predictable, uninvolving story.I kept comparing this to the TV show Ugly Betty, which does the sensitive outsider theme so much more creatively ( And with the talented, sparkling actress America Ferrera in the Anne Hathaway role).Regarding the love interest played by that cute actor Adrian ...(last name???) all I kept thinking is ""Vinnie ya need to be back with your Entourage on HBO"".One of the, no, it IS the most overrated movie of the year."
1,"It's Not the Movie, It's Unbox - Take 2","This was the first movie that I attempted to download using Unbox. What A Headache!!! The movie would not download. After posting about this experience on my blog, I received 2 responses from people saying that they had the same problem with this particular movie. We receive a message saying, ""Allocating space: 100%."" That's great! The software has allocated the space, but how about downloading the movie?! The others who have had this difficulty are encouraging me to try other movies on Unbox, but now I am very hesitant to do so until I know that Amazon is taking the issue seriously."
3,Overall entertaining,"Having just read the book, I decided to check out the movie as well. Streep was excellent as Miranda Priestly and managed to capture the viciousness of the original character. Hathaway was also good as well. What I didn't enjoy was the changed ending. I wish that Andrea Sachs had confronted Priestly in Paris (and told her off) like she did in the book. I think the movie missed much of the bitterness of Andrea's wasted year and made it too much of a learning experience for her. The fact that some reviewers could come out of the theatre thinking that this was a story about empowered women shows that the movie didn't get the right tone at the end.An another note, the volume on this DVD is way off. I found it nearly impossible to hear some of the dialogue, even though I had it on full blast. Then the music would overwhelm me. They didn't calibrate it well."
3,Streep!,"Without her, there would have been no movie! It was fairly a formulistic transformation movie, where homey girl goes high fashion, without explaining where she got all those clothes and who did her makeup. But it keep rolling along on a quest to please the irascible Streep (and my employees think I'm demanding!), and made one root (though not all that loudly) for the hapless then stellar Andrea (Emily?). In the end, not much of a message, except perhaps the banal and obvious, ""Stay true to yourself""."
4,Very Good Look at the Fashion Business,"Anne Hathaway plays a rootsy, down to earth girl who is looking for a job as a journalist. But the only decent paying job she can find is working as a personal assistant for a renowned fashion critic (played brilliantly by Meryl Streep).Anne falters at first, but then learns how to excelt at her jon. But the demands of the job and the morally compromising situations she finds herself in put a major strain on her relationships with her boyfriend and her long time friends.As her life begins to head in the wrong direction, her friends try to save their down to earth friend from being carried away by the demands of her pressing new life.The movie is well done, a fine adaptation of the best selling novel."
4,Another great performance by Meryl Streep,"Meryl Streep is perhaps one of the greatest actresses of recent note. She is capable of carrying a movie and clearly outshines her cast in this movie. The movie is in a way predictable, but you find yourself liking and sympathizing with ""the Devil"" due to the immense talent Ms. Streep employs to bring the character to life on the screen. Also notable is the performance rendered by Stanley Tucci as Nigel (vs his villainous role in Terminal) - a good solid portrayal of a loyal second that never questions, never complains in a way that humanizes the woman who employs him. Nigel is convincing in his understanding of the woman most others hate. On a broader level, this movie highlights and pokes fun at a world most of us will never see (and fortunately so). Well worth viewing."
5,Loved the movie,Never got to see it at the movie theatre but I've been wanting to rent it for a while now. I was not disappointed!
5,Hilarious and Though Provoking,"Very good movie. Very good acting. I watched it a few times over, already. I love this movie. Merryl Streep and Ann Hathaway were fabulous."
5,Wickedly entertaining!,"The Devil Wears Prada starring Meryl Streep, Anne Hathway, and Emily Blunt is deliciously sinful. Streep has never played such a feisty, fearless, and bitchy character! And by the way honey, a size 6 is not fat (thank you very much!) Hathway brings vunerability and strength to her character, Blunt is hilarious as well as she tries to dodge unwanted criticism from Miranda (Streep). The Devil Wears Prada can be mean at times but the somwewhat sappy ending makes up for it. Great fashion, clever story, and an outstanding cast is what you'll get from this summer blockbuster. Have fun!"
2,It's Not the Movie -- It's the UnBox,"This is the first movie I downloaded via the new UnBox service.I really wanted to like this movie. But I'm hard of hearing, and the UnBox service did not provide closed-captioning. Meryl Streep talks so softly throughout the movie that I could not understand 90% of what she said. So a movie that probably ought to get 3-4 stars gets only 2.It's not the movie. It's the UnBox."
3,Mildly amusing,"""Mildly amusing"" was how another reviewer put it, and I agree entirely, purely because of Meryl Streep. Streep is wonderful as this outrageous caricature of an egocentric (if not egomaniacal) fashion magagine head, who never speaks above a whisper, but whose every whisper is like the thunder of the Almighty to her mesmerised/terrified underlings. The entire world revolves around this woman and don't you dare even think otherwise. Only once does the character show some vulnerability, but that soon passes and she's firmly back in the saddle. Streep's harrassed 2-I-C is also excellent, everyone else is filler. Anne Hathaway looks gorgeous in a variety of outfits, but little else."
5,A++++++++++ and 5 stars!!!,"This is one of Meryl Streeps best performances, and she has had many. I highly recommend it for the MS fan, or anyone who wants a good laugh."
5,Great movie!,"Great movie. Really funny. As usual Meryl Streep plays her roll to the hilt, she's perfect! Lots of fun! Quick and easy purchase thanks to Amazon.com."
3,The Movie is Much Better than the Book,"The film adaptation for the novel, made this a much more interesting story line, and much more believable than the novel. For those that have read the book, you'll probably like the move better as it's a better story.The casting for this moving was pretty right on, however the casting for the character Christian seemed way off. While charming, he was much older and much less attractive than expected - I and found it a little unvbelievable that he would turn Andie's head in any way. I had actually hoped this character would have a bigger role in the movie based on what I read in the book. This character could have been removed from the movie and wouldn't have made a different. Because of the casting, he should have been.Meryl Streep is fabulous and nails this character perfectly as does Ann Hathaway. The clothes in the movie are great and it's a great story - just not one of the best movies ever. I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5."
1,Buyer Beware-Not A Movie For Adults!!!,"I'm embarrassed to say I watched this. Fortunately, I can blame it on my wife, who did not know that this is ""The Princess Diaries"" meant to hit the late teen female demo. Supposedly there is a book more sophisticated than the movie with the same title... I'd go so far as to say that the Olsen twins have probably made movies with more depth than this.This is one the longest 2,467 hours you will spend watching a film."
1,Nada Prada,"Ok, if you're under 20, this could have been entertaining.Meryl Streep is an exceptional talent..... Really she is - just not here."
1,A cartoon movie with comic characters,"the devil wear prada, a movie that feature a well respectable cast, but every character in here looks cartoonish way and bland, Stanley Tucci (the same stereotypal gay thing) meryl streep, The lady dragon (the angry boss) and Anne Hathaway (which never lost his princess diary role thing) by the way in this movie she looks very much like penelope cruz.One thing that the movie never explain, who, or where anne characters find this expensive wardrobe and why nobody ask her where she boght that gears and how."
1,Makes you want to take a long hot soapy shower,"No character development whatsoever. Entirely predictable plot. The writing like a first play, from talented high school senior.Compare it with a film with complex characters for whom crises of integrity genuinely matter. Like ""Magnolia,"" for example. Or ""All That Jazz."" Films like that are chocolate cake. This is a Twinkie.Meryl Streep is a great actor. Too bad she's not in it. What a shame."
2,"The real ""star"" is Anne Hathaway","Meryl Streep (and it pains me to say this) is almost an embarassment in this ""pumped up"" chick flick. If it weren't for the incredible cast ""below"" her this would have been a total disaster. The real ""star"" is Anne Hathaway. She is mesmerizing as the assistant to Miranda (Streep) who steals every scene she's in. And that's saying something becasue she's in every scene. I can't help but wonder what a Glenn Close or Catherine Zeta-Jones might have done with this role. As it stands her understated (way, way, way understated) performance is hollow and shrill. She mumbles throughout the entire film as if she were a female Marlon Brando. Her soft (almost inaudible) volume never fluctuates. Her face seems to be painted on as if she were wearing a mask. It's all very annoying. Too bad.....this could have been a keeper. Instead it now seems destined for the $5.00 bin."
1,Give Me a Purple...er Heliotrope... Heart...,"because I lasted through precisely 41 minutes and 32 seconds, according to my DVD time counter, of this lumbering satire. With humor as broad as the size 14 it mocks, The Devil Wears Prada manages to be even more self-absorbed than its purported target for mockery, the fashion industry press. Even some swell New York shots can't save this utterly predictable paint-by-numbers movie from being a complete waste of time."
2,Less than expected,"From the widespread raves, you'd think this fairly thin coming of age tale was Shakespeare. It's not. It's an adaptation of a book I never read, but the title was slapped onto the movie to help sell it without any true reference to it in the film. Meryl Streep is the one to watch here. Her performance is outstanding. But the rest is rather cliched slapstick. I expected something more sophisticated. Silly me."
2,A chore,"if you must see this piece of fluff, see it only for the leading women in the movie.However, this movie is predictable and paced so slow, that I nearly walked out of the theater. Again, what redeems it is the women of the film."
3,Bad Ending,Would someone who was given a chance to improve themselves give it all up to make a point ???
4,Very Good movie,"As always, Meryl Streep is excellent in ""The Devil Wears Prada."" Although I am not a fashion guru and see the premise of the movie to be shallow, for pure entertainment, I do recommend the movie. As an older adult I appreciate one of the subtle messages of doing what you have to do to get the job done according to the boss' wishes instead of whining and complaining!"
2,Don't go by the previews! -this is dissappointing.,"This movie was just... -missing something. I kept thinking that all of the drama was leading somewhere, but, really, it missed the climax. I thought that the Miranda Priestly character (played by Meryl Streep)was WAY too soft spoken. -We kept turning up the volume on our tv because most of the time it seemed she was MUMBLING her lines! It was irritating. In my opinion, the story had potential, but what it turned out to be was -just weak. -And predictable.If it hadn't been for the clever name of the movie and the fact that Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway were the main characters, I can't see how it would have ever made it to the theaters. -Overdone advertising, and someone who has friends in high places is most likely the reason. The 'trailers' for this movie pumped it up to be something it just isn't.Dissapointing."
2,The Devil sold out,This movie has great acting and a bad script. The book was so much better. The movie is watered down to almost nothing. It should have been much better. Read the book for a fun time.
2,not convincing....,"As much as I love Meryl Streep, and I do love MS, I found this movie annoying. It wasn't funny, and the plot was way too predictable. I knew at the beginning that the very moral Andrea would be tempted to betray her friends for power and privilege, but in the end she would realize the error of her ways. Streep's character was too unbelievably ""evil"". With many comedies you are convinced to suspend your sense of the ridiculous if the movie is done well enough. This never happened for me in this movie. Perhaps some of my disdain has to do with the fact that I have no interest in, or tolerance for the high fashion industry. I'd rather be frying trout on a campfire by a beautiful river."
4,?,I'm normally good at predicting how movies will end but i was waaayyy off on this one.I enjoyed it but i was sad when she stopped working for the magazine. :(
5,"Great movie, great price!","I am very happy with the movie I ordered from this seller. The movie came within a few days of placing my order. It came as stated on Amazon, and I got it for a great price. I am very happy that I ordered this movie because I couldn't find it in the store when I looked for it. I would recommend this seller, I have no complaints."
3,Streep and Blunt walk away with the movie,"'Devil Wears Prada' ostensibly stars Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep. Streep upholds her end of the bargain. Her riff on Anna Wintour (Editor-in-Chief of the U.S. edition of Vogue) is an awesome sight to behold. But Hathaway is outshone not only by Streep, but also by Emily Blunt. In fact, Blunt - in conjunction with Streep - steals the movie. She deserved that Golden Globe. The line that absolutely killed me was: ""If you lose Paris for me, I will search every Blimpie's in the tri-state area till I find you."" Great line, perfect delivery. Meanwhile, Hathaway is put in a bad place: she's forced to act in conjuction with Adrian Grenier, who's playing her boyfriend. He's just totally 'blah' here, no other way to say it."
3,What is all the fuss about?,"At long last I finally watched this DVD last night, and I confess I am confused as to why all the huzzahs and praise for this movie. It was a bore whenever Meryl Streep wasn't on the screen. She's wonderful! But without her, this is a Lifetime movie. Realize negative reviews here don't win popularity points, but sorry, it's the truth. And am I the only one who thinks the grown-up Anne Hathaway is sorta...dull?"
1,much ado about nothing,"I was attracted to the movie by all the hoopla, and then terribly disappointed.A young woman gives up the chance to study law at Stanford. Instead, she becomes a gopher (lower even than a secretary) running menial errands for a bitchy fashion critic. Her motive? Meet the right people! How stupid could she get?What a waste of her time and mine."
2,The Devil IS Prada,"Meaningless tripe about the fashion world. Oh sure, our young heroine decides in the end that the high pressure life of top flight fashion power mongering she's tried to get involved in isn't for her, but nowhere is there any indictment of that ""world"" itself, and for sure the crossroads of celebrities and fashion design needs to be taken down a few rungs (more now than ever). Besides the paltry lesson of staying true to yourself and the friends you had before climbing the ladder to success, about th only major point hit home by the filmmakers is that those glossy fashion mags give hope to those sad boys who'd rather be sewing than palling around with the other fellows who like sports. Oh brother! Film doesn't work as just a light romantic comedy either, so it's a total failure."
5,"Loved the movie, looks great on blu-ray!","I really enjoyed this movie; the story is entertaining and has a nice mix of drama, comedy and fashion! Great music and acting."
4,Review for DWP,Good movie with a excellet quality video. Although I think that should have more subtitle options.
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:If you take aside Meryl Streep's ice queen and the appealingly bitchy Emily Blunt, all you have left is a ridiculously contrived story without an inch of unpredictability; it's disposable entertainment for people who fetishize clothes."
3,the devil wears prada,I bought this DVD for work- i work with teenagers to watch it in relation to the media portrayal of fashion and the bullying tactics in this movie-man meryl is a nazi in this movie-a good story line too-which is nice to see for hollywood!
3,FUNNY ......BUT SAD BECAUSE IT IS ALL TOO TRUE!,"My wife wanted to watch this movie so I decided to see what it was all about. I know nothing of the book, so I don't know if it is accurate or not, nor do I care! The film is well written and funny at times, but it is sad knowing that much of this insanity is so true! It did hold my interest and the acting is fine, so that is a plus. It's worth your time to watch, but I wouldn't buy it. One view will do!....hey I made a rhyme! ain't I clever?........I need a vacation!"
3,"A Poor Imitation of ""Working Girl""","Streep, as always, is fabulous in her role but the rest of the plot is predictable, the characters unconvincing, and Anne Hathaway miscast in a role that is vapid. I wanted to know far more about Streep's character but was totally bored with the Hathaway cardboard character. The movie reminds you of Working Girl but the comparison to the original suffers as Streep alone cannot carry this turkey."
4,Even mean executives are human,"The Devil Wears Prada is a must for all would be actors, musicians, artists, models, writers, in fact; any creative person who dares to stick his or her head up above the crowd. The film presents the real world of fashion and the harsh world of competition and all that goes with it.Well worth owning."
5,superlative movie!!,"One of the best movies that has a love story, career story and excellent acting all around, this one will keep you interested and holds up well during multiple viewing. We bought it because we've seen it three or four times already, and wanted to have it in our permanent collection. Priced low and in Blu-Ray you can't go wrong with this one!!"
4,Good Chick-flick to Add to Your List; Especially if you're a Fashionista,"Became a fan of Anne Hathaway and always enjoy Meryl Streep. This was entertaining, but a chick flick. Wouldn't watch it with my guy. Love the clothes!"
4,fun,"fun, light, easy movie to like. meryll streep will always make any movie a million times better. somehow i like this movie a lot"
2,The Devil Bores Read-a and Moviego-a,"I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common. I can't say I really liked either. The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" taught me about ""roman a clefs"", of which ""Devil"" is one. Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that ""Devil"" provides. Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough. Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) ""made over princess"" role. The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as ""best friend"" Lily, are mostly wasted."
3,Just OK - the book is better,"If you can, read the book, and then save the movie for when it is released for rental. It wasn't bad. The story however, is predictable and the movie is (or at least seemed) long so we were squirming in our seats and ready to go about 20-30 minutes before the conclusion.Anne Hathaway is cute, transforming her self from undergrad to a NY girl channeling her inner fashion maven. (She did it better in Princess Diaries and she was a lot more fun and likeable in that).Stanley Tucci, as always, was great but didn't get enough time on the film.The saving grace and crowning glory though is Meryl Streep as the mean fashion editor (Anna Wintour anyone?) which she played wonderfully, not having to overact but rather relying on the smallest gestures. She shows why she is still great and can open films!!"
2,Not for everyone (including me),"My wife insisted on renting this movie, despite my opposition. Was my oppositon to it justified in the end? I believe so. This got two stars instead of one because the acting was actually pretty good, but this movie, as many reviewers have already classified it, is a chick flick and only served to personify the stereotypical superficiality that seems to be idolized by so many in our society. Granted, the main character 'learns her lesson' in the end (big surprise!), about half way through the movie I couldn't standy any of the characters any more. (slight spoiler to the handful who didn't guess the plot before seeing it) The movie follows a young girls descent from a kind, caring college grad looking for a job to a materialistic, backstabbing, stuck up [..], and back again. If you're a fan of Sex and the City, you will most likely enjoy this movie, but, considering I despise that show as well, this movie was definitely not for me."
4,my comments,This is one of the best movies I have seen in long time. Meryl Streep should get an oscar for her performance. Her english speaking assistant should get an award for Best Supporting Actress. Ann Hathaway was very good in the picture but her pace wore me out.
4,Never thought I'd like this,But Streep is gold. The lady actually builds some sympathy for a character that could have been a stereotype. Some decent laughs.
3,"This is a great movie, but it is not like the book.","I read the book on which this film is based before seeing this film. I loved the book, & I thought that the film would replicate the book. I was wrong. It's a great film, but I was disappointed that the film did not replicate the book. Some of the concepts in the book are the same in the film, but some are not. For example, Andy's (Hathaway's) boyfriend in the film is not the same as he is in the book. I guess they had to make some changes so that the film wasn't so long. My advice is to read the book! I enjoyed the book more than the film.The Devil Wears Prada"
3,Fashionably predictable,"Has Meryl Streep ever given a poor performance? If she has, I haven't seen it. You find yourself disliking Miranda Priestly, played by Streep, in very short order. And I think Anne Hathaway, who plays the green journalist Andrea Sachs, is slowly coming on as a convincing actress in her own right. Emily Blunt is hilarious as the first assistant who jealously teaches Sachs the ropes of waiting hand and foot on Priestly. And I can't forget the always solid Stanley Tucci. This is definitely a coming of age story with the standard be-yourself ending. Although you can predict its direction, the performances were strong and the movie has a happy ending."
4,Real life or Fairy Tale?,This is a realistic portrayal of high fashion. Perhaps a bit more. It looks a little puffed-up to me. In any case I would recommend a look especially if you like fashion. Has nice story as well.
3,Unfortunate Blah . . .,"With the winning cast and all the hype, I had expected so much more. Yes, the clothes were breath-taking, but the storyline and dialogue fell flat. I didn't see any kind of growth on the part of Andie's character--not that she had to. I felt that her boyfriend and friends were simply rebelling against a image-conscious society and were, therefore, guilty of the same crime they accuse Andie of: viewing only an outer image, not the person beneath. The story had such potential, but was just . . . well . . . blah."
5,great Chick movie and even for old married couples,"My wife made me see this movie with her and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Meryl is great and Stanley Tucci is his old self in this movie. Makes you appreciate a good boss.I saw this in the movies and bought this for my wife for Christmas, she was very happy to get it for her dvd collection.Our 16 year old daughter enjoyed this movie also."
4,A guy who liked this movie,"I'm a guy, but I actually enjoyed this movie. It made me want to shop. It has it's moments, but it wasn't something I would watch on my own... or even want to own... my sister and girlfriend at the time loved the movie though. Great gift for a chick. Book Chicks would probably appreciate the book more. I didn't read it, but my sister adored it."
5,highly entertaining and well performed,"nicely done. only the boy friend cast was not appropriate enough. there's nothing wrong with the materialism, the brands, the brand names. men or women, without clothings, or without beautiful clothings, would all look the same. human beings are differred from other creatures only with clothes. men or women, once naked, would just look almost the same. what makes the world more interesting? those beautiful clothes and the accessories. this is a highly entertaining movie."
1,Stupid!,i did not like this movie it was stupid and boring. It is not even good stupid not worth it.
1,Never buy in this store!,"They are telling me they already sent by USPS and tracking number also indicates ""delivered"".However, I can't find anything every where.It might be hard to tell it is not a store's fault, but how can I refund?I think it is a better solution not to use this store!"
2,Ho Hum,"I was more than a little disappointed by this film. Perhaps my expectations had been unrealistically raised. Perhaps the film was just not that good. In fact, it was probably a bit of both.I suspect the New York fashion industry has its fair share of piranhas swimming about in the pond. Yet, having said this, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was simply an attempt to use caricature as a vehicle for comedy. This works for a while but, at some point, it begins to wear a bit thin.Can I recommend this film to the reader? Alas, no. Save your time and money for something else."
2,What was the point of this film?,"My wife brought this home and I must admit, it seemed like a very predictable ""formula film"".Not really funny, no real message to be found, just 2 hours of a girl running errands.... and forget all the ""be true to who you are"" messages th film was trying ???? to express...that was obviously the formula of this film five minutes in.Great acting and performances but nothing of any substance..... I walked away with the feeling.... ""what was that all about""?"
2,EXPECTED BETTER,I couldn't wait to get this movie after all the hype about it.Most definately a womans movie-guys will hate it--I just expected more-weak story line-sorry I paid for it and didn't wait until it was on cable.
5,Great!,"A tremendous improvement to the OEM Harley-Davidson 10R12X plugs. My Buell has a cold-blooded air-cooled motor that tends to cough, sputter and generally run like crap until sufficiently warmed up. As autumn descends on the northeast, my bike is running better than ever on cool mornings! I hope erosion wear rates are also improved down the line."
4,"Awsome Plasma 42"" for the price","I bought my Maxent 42"" a little less than a year ago. My kids love it because of the size for their video games as well as watching their favorite shows. My only concern has been in the past month I have started to see the individual red pixels ( I think thats what they are ) after the set has been on for a long time and when the room is very dark. It only happens on occasion so far, and I'm hoping it doesn't get worse. I love the quality for the price I paid. I would not have been able to afford one otherwise. I would recommend this to anyone and would have rated it 5 stars if not for the red pixel problem.(which is very minor, my kids never even noticed it) Good luck and I hoped this helped..."
5,Excellent,"These are perfect for cold winter days. Very soft and very warm, length and fit are good. Merino wool is the best, wicks sweat, no odor. I'm about 6'-1"" ordered size Large"
1,"expensive, ridiculous fit only good for obese people","Being 175 centimeters tall -- or short, if you will -- I thought it to beclever to choose size L. I wanted to get a good fit by allowing for someshrinkage due to washing it, you know.As it turned out, this piece of garnment is incredibly wide at the hipwhile it barely reaches my ankles. And my proportions are such that mylegs are not overly long for sure. You must be obese to have a good fit.If you are a slim guy like me - forget it. This product is expensive toboot. It does keep my legs warm but around the hip it feels like alousy sack."
4,Death in the Devil's Acre,"Pitt and Charlotte are at it again. The subjects Ms. Perry chooses always seem to startle me, only because I feel in the Victorian time, it would be such a scandal, which ofcourse is what makes it delicious for us. The women of the Victorian times are trying to break out from some of their perceived roles as women.Having read these in order, it's fun to see characters reintroduced.With all the shows on TV, like CSI,it's fun to see what things they did to identify bodies, how long they could keep a dead body, etc.Very enjoyable read."
4,Devil's Acre,"Anne Perry writes a very interesting story with mounds of character and period development. If you read the entire series in the order which she wrote the Thomas Pitt mysteries, you will get a lot more out of each book. You must read until you get to Cardington Crescent. Its got to be the best one she wrote so far."
3,Good mystery except...,"I very much enjoyed the mystery aspect of this book and could not wait to find out who the murderer was (I thought it was someone different than who it turned out to be). However, the thing that bothered me throughout the entire book was the odd interaction between Charlotte and Thomas. I have read a number of the other books and I certainly could not see that there was any type of ""collaboration"" between the two of them. There seemed to be very little contact between them to begin with and what there was consisted almost entirely of him telling her to mind her own business. Of course, being Charlotte, she ignored him and did what she felt was necessary to gather information which she never really gave to him. Nevertheless, the story was well written and kept the reader interested."
4,"Bookin' My Scraps, Baby!","I've wanted to be an artist for as long as I can remember. Or at least since junior high school, when that kid in my homeroom got to second base with Shelley Cummings by painting her portrait on his Trapper Keeper.But I never learned how to 'art'. So now I'm trying to learn on my own. And to remember where I put my old Trapper Keeper. Because you're never too old for second base.So I decided to try scrapbooking.This book was just perfect for a beginner like me, taking me through all the steps to organize my photos, display my mementos with flair, and preserve all of my precious memories on the page.The only problem is, I don't take pictures. Or keep mementos. And I can barely remember what I had for lunch today -- but I'm pretty certain it wasn't ""precious"". I guess I could gussy up a notebook to hold my last Twix wrapper and the receipt from the 7-11, but apart from that, I got nothing. Is there such a thing as scrap-PostIt-noting? That's probably more my speed."
3,Outdated,"I wasn't a huge fan of this book. I found a lot of the techniques and tools they used to be outdated. I'm a scrapbooking newbie, and really wanted this book to introduce me to interesting techniques for putting together layouts. However, I found the instructions to be lacking, the info on tools to be very skimpy, and the ideas for layouts to be uninspiring. There are much better (free) online resources."
5,Fun and educational.,I was very pleased with these cards. I work in a child development center and bought these both for circle time and free play time and the kids love them. They'll sit around for twenty minutes looking over the pictures and showing them to each other. They've learned almost all the names and it's proved to be well worth the investment.
3,Broken Cord difficult to read,Although the author had lots of great information on his FAS child his history and experience as an anthropologist makes the reading difficult. He sometimes spends more time describing the wind or the surroundings than he does talking about his son's issues. Two other books I read on the same subject were riveting and sad in their own way. Michael Dorris' detours made me not want to read the book because paragraphs would go by describing the grass swaying in the wind rather than how he was coping or dealing with his son's terrible affliction. I wish the movie was available for viewing because in this case the summarized cinematic version might be better.
5,A book to change your world,"I consider this one of the most important books I've ever read (and like you, I've read A LOT of books). It's one of the few books you pick up in a lifetime that change how you see the world. Along with ""Plagues and Peoples"" and ""Guns, Germs and Steel,"" it's in my permanent Top Three for non-fiction books.No one asks to be born with FAS or other mental disabilities. They don't ask to be harmed in utero, or neglected afterward, either by their parents or by society. Yet they must somehow cope in life, and so must those around them.That we live in the richest country in the world, yet are too selfish to ensure adequate pre- and post-natal care for every child is horrifying, and we all pay the price in the long run."
3,the video quality is poor,The print is missing many audio tracks and the print is not a good one. Story is overly simple.Not Spielberg!
1,Abraham Lincoln,"Abraham LincolnThis is the last movie I will try to ""rent"" from Amazon. It never would download. It is probably an excellent portrayal by a great actor but I wouldn't know."
5,Thank God It's Friday,"Holy Moly!!!! What a Great CD...I own the LP also..and the Movie..Music from Paul Jabara ""Trapped in a Stairway"" DC La Rue ""Do You Want the Real Thing?"" Diana Ross ""Livin'Lovin'Giving..Cameo,The Commodores,""Too Hot Ta'Trot""..Love and Kisses with the Title Track..And of course Donna Summer!!!! ""Last Dance""..This Is Da BOMB!!!Takes me back to those Good Old Disco Day's.....Pre AIDS,,Happy Club Times!!!! A+++++"
4,A nice disco compilation...,"In this package you can find hits like the full version of ""Last Dance"" and other two songs from Donna Summer: ""With your love"" and ""Je't aime moi non plus"", a very orgasmic song... but it's long and boring, the opposite of other long time running hits from her (""Love to love you Baby"" or ""Try me, I Know, We can make it"", that are real masterpieces). The real discovery here is the rare but extremely good disco tunes, like Pattie Brooks's ""After Dark"", Thelma Houston's ""Love Masterpiece"", Paul Jabara's ""Disco Queen"" and Diana Ross's ""Lovin'Livin'and Givin'"". A truly good experience, even more if you had seen the movie and you can remember the exact moment with the songs.I highly recomend it for every disco fan. You'll love it! The movie has a really bad argument, but it's fun, and you can see Donna Summer acting... for the first and only time. I recomend it too!"
2,meh,"Any fan of disco will know there's only a handful of gems on this soundtrack. TGIF - the movie and soundtrack - was a commercial proposition with little concern for lasting quality, so much of the soundtrack reflects the late 70s rampant commercialisation of mediocre dance music. I love disco (and all its subsequent permutations), but on this album I only ever listen to Patti Brooks' After Dark, and maybe Thelma Houston's Love Masterpiece - the rest are either overplayed (Donna Summer) or sludge (Summer's Je T'aime and the rest). Tread carefully."
2,"great idea, flimsy execution","I wanted this knife as soon as I saw it online. It just seemed natural to have these tools clustered together in a small package. I have seen other items from Tool Logic and think their ideas are great. I was less excited, however, when I actually put my hands on the knife. Actually had I handled the knife prior to buying it I would not have purchased it. The handle was similar to other ""zytel""-type slabs, the fire steel works as well as could be expected for one of the size, and the whistle is loud. My big issue with this knife is the flimsy feel and lock up of the blade itself. Since I feel having a tool to process wood for fuel and game for food is the most important, a blade this thin with a sort of sloppy lock up did not quite measure up. I think a slightly thicker spine on the blade and a more robust lock would make a better application of a really good idea."
4,Usefull on campings,"Very useful tool on camping. The whistle works perfectly, very loud. Need some practice with fire starter, but when you know how to use it, it become easy."
1,How does this have good reviews?,"I found this on the ground while i was mountain biking. when i picked it up i thought it was a 3-4 dollar knife by amount the blade wiggles and the horrible locking of the blade. i cant even believe that people are paying close to 20 dollars for it. The whistle doesn't work. Even being free i still find it difficult to carry around such a horrible knife. the only good thing i have to say is the flint thing, however it takes a solid 2 minutes to remove it from the knife. and its something you will NEVER need. i wouldnt pay 5 dollars for this thing. get a Leatherman e33L best knife for under 30! in my opinion"
3,A bit uneven but enjoyable low budget horror,Midnight is an adaptation of a novel written by the director John Russo. I have not read his book but the movie is an enjoyable cheesy slasher film. Members of the Romero NOTLD tree also contributed to this picture. If you enjoy 80's horror then you'll like this one.
2,Not so great with a crappy ending = not for my collection !,"This obscure early 80's low-budget horror film is a 50/50 type of effort. You get 50% crap(crap acting,crap music,crap atmosphere,dry kills,crap storyline) & 50% good entertainment(some what decent acting,some spooky music/sound efx,some decent atmosphere,some decent kills,) but for me what tips the scale towards the thumbs down direction is the very end of the movie it was way too cheesey. It left you without any type of a climax! Now i love both films 'JUST BEFORE DAWN'&'SLAUGHTERHOUSE' but its almost like some shmucks collected all the scraps off the cutting room floor of those gems & came up with 'MIDNIGHT'. One helping of this film is all i need.Next!?!"
1,Poor in almost all respects,"The only halfway decent thing about this film is the makeup FX by Tom Savini, and even those aren't terrific. Terrible acting, poor script, weak story, the list of problems goes on. A film entirely populated by ugliness, even the female lead in this one is so unattractive it makes one ask why the step-dad would even bother in the first place?! Populates many lists of ""worst ever made""."
4,a longtime fan of Dr Millhuff,"I first met Dr Millhuff in 1988 during a Revival Meeting in Hemet, Ca. His presence and God-given message was as powerful then - and I believe in much the same way this book is now.He guides the reader through his impressionable years and talks of how he was impacted. He unapologetically explains that his twin brother was not affected in the same way by the same experiences. This was not explored further in the book, but it points out a great psychological truth -- we all develop diferently based on our individual interpretations of the same experiences.Use this book to re-examine your early life and decisions!!"
3,Noisy shoes,These shoes make a squishing noise every step. They are comfortable but the noise is annoying.
2,Not for Everyone,"The best thing that can be said about these sandals is their price. Add in the shipping costs, however, which more than double the price, and it is no longer such a bargain. The sandals were shipped from Canada in an envelope and arrived with the uppers somewhat squished and misshapen. Sturdy bottoms, with massage nubs are adequate, but can be uncomfortable or off-putting against the soles of the foot for some. The main complaint is with the uppers, or the strip the goes over the foot. The inner portion that touches the foot is somewhat abrasive, especially at the point where it joins with bottom part. Sensitive or wide feet need to be cautious as this sandal rubs against the instep and side of foot. I have found similar - and more comfortable- sandals at local major retailers for the same or less money - with no shipping charges and an assured fit before purchase. These sandals are not the worst out there, neither are they the best, but the price is right (sans shipping)."
