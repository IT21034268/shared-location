1,Bad,"This is the second worst movie i have ever seen, only barely edging out a horrible movie entitled ""Shakes the Clown"" for the Absolute Worst Honors. If you like to think for yourself and have half the brain then this movie is probably not for you."
4,References to other documentaries,"To better appreciate this movie, it's good to know that it makes references (many, in fact) to the 1966 Bob Dylan documentary ""Don't Look Back."" If you haven't seen this earlier movie, naturally you won't pick up on these references (which are funny). What's interesting, though, is that at about the same time ""Bob Roberts"" was being made, the director of ""Don't Look Back"" was making a documentary (or perhaps had made ...), similar in nature to his earlier film, about Bill Clinton's campaign for the presidency called ""The War Room."" Cinema verite, no doubt."
4,ultimate election night party DVD,"This is a great DVD to watch with friends during an election year. We had a group of 15 people howling with laughter. You have to love a politician who closes a letter to a 7-year-old Vermont girl with the admonition ""Don't do crack; it's a ghetto drug."""
5,Only time will tell......,"Name any emotion and it IS on this great album.It's the best CD that I have heard in a long time.It is ravishingly,rapturously contagious...Regina is not a short-track sprinter who will burn out.Her vocals and her music captivate you slowly and steadly as she goes on to win the marathon...We all know that CLASS endures...Only time will tell !"
4,Regina Regina,"Very nice, sensuous and tastefully done. Regina Belle, George Duke and Christian McBride? Come on - this collaboration comes out exactly how it should - sexy, groove oriented and pleasing to the palate.www.wclk.com 91.9fm Atlanta"
5,The greatest,"If AMERICAN IDOL's often technically impressive karaoke contests have taught us anything,it's that there's an enormous difference between a great voice and a great singer.Regina Belle is that rare artist who is both.Whether offering a sensuous,elegant take on the the title track (Lazy Afternoon) or a soulful,intense version of Frank Sinatra's signature song ""Fly Me To The Moon"",which sheturns masterfully into a fantastic,passionate yet delicate ballad.Regina wields her lustrous,incomparable voice with an insight and discretion that enrich the Jazz/Soul nuances of all the tracks,impeccably produced and arranged by George Duke.Listen and learn,kids ! And do NOT expect to see her on TV !"
2,Terrible.....,"How I so WANTED to love this CD...I really did. This CD dispells my theory that all you need is good music to have a great CD. The music is incredible and you cannot deny any arrangements and performances by George Duke. He is the absolute BEST, but Regina's vocals murder some really great compositions. Her voice just doesn't do what this awesome music does. Her vocals are choppy and she cannot complete a full note and carry it through with or without vibrato. If you've heard some of the great remakes of standards by Natalie Cole, Patti Austin (check out her version of Lazy Afternoon) and even Chaka Kahn, it's really hard to listen to this CD. This was a waste of some really good music."
3,OK music,The music on the Lazy Afternoon CD is good but not spectacular in my tastes. For me it is good as 'variety' music.
4,A worthwhile read,"As an amateur naturalist myself, I was hoping for more of the observational writing that Burroughs does so well. This more opinionated style is not what I was hoping for, but it's an,interesting read nonetheless. It's quite interesting to read about his ideas on animal intelligence and compare them to what we now know."
5,Great Soft Listening,"I never thought I would give 5 stars to an album like this, but it is really excellent. I am not a fan of soft listening music (Kenny G, etc.), but this is a fave of mine."
2,Dissapointed in product but good customer service,I purchased the ink for my canon S900. The ink does not work printing pictures. I called Abacus and they sent me new ink without question and very quickly. The ink still is not working and I am still trying to figure out the problem with abacus. Testing is very expensive because I have to keep using the paper to test.
2,Cartridge dries out quickly,"I don't use my printer a whole lot maybe a few times a month. The ink in these cartridges dries up quickly. Every time I turn my printer back on, I have to replace a cartridge that has dried up. The quality of the print is decent though."
2,Canon compatible cartridges,"Like all compatible cartridges I have tried these are another disappointment. Canon is notorious for the short life span of their inkjet cartridges, but their cartridges do not mess up your printer, leak ink, or disappoint when you want to print a color photo."
3,the man who haunted himself,"The Man Who Haunted Himselfstarring Roger Moore.other than having the ""William Wilson"" Poe story in common,this movie is almost a remake.The Man Who Haunted Himself.One of my favorite films...I think I remember Jarvis Cocker loving it as well...if you like this movie... you should look into this movie:The Man Who Haunted HimselfPermalink: http://amzn.com/B00005RYLJ"
1,A Waste of Celluloid,"I won't even try to describe the ridiculously vague plot, the inappropriate use of background music, or the obviously painted dummy of Lena Headey that looked like Pinocchio's wooden mother. If you must see this film (we only watched it because of Lena), wait for it on cable. I want my two hours back."
2,Unrewarding,"Lena Headey and Richard Jenkins are great in this film. The bad and odd part is the movie ends without explanation. It is about mysterious beings that are possessing people's bodies. All of this filmed very realistically. The theme and setting are good, the plot builds, but then it's as if the producers ran out of money and ended the show. This movie will be forgotten. Too bad. It really had potential. At the least the viewer deserves an answer even if it is flimsy, difficult to recommend this one."
1,Depressing Waste of Time & Talent,"A depressing waste of time and talent. Impressive cinematography and acting cannot save a nonsensical and nihilistic ""plot"". Gratuitous violence with no motivation. A horrible murder scene also. Be forewarned. Skip this."
4,LONG TELEPHONE EXTENSION,"I RAN THIS CABLE THROUGH THE HOUSE, AFTER IT CAME FROM AMAZON SHIPPING. SURPRISE, SURPRISE THE FAX MACHINE WORKED JUST AS WELL AS IT DID ON A 6 FOOT CORD. FIFTY FOOT GIVES YOU A BIG ADVANTAGE IN PLACING YOUR EQUIPMENT."
4,fun and cute,"The morning I stumbled on this movie, I was intrigued by the title. I actually watched the whole movie and then watched again. I have read with the reviews before posting my own.The morning after i watched it, I got my partner and she and I watched it. True, it did not provide the blood and guts, but it was not intended too. This movie would be appreciated by bands that are just starting out to make it big.Yes it was surprising that it was made in Africa. But the best scenes in the movie were near the end. The surprise in the band was cool and most definate, the selling of the land.We thought it was a great movie and away from the Friday the 13th predicative scenes.Awesome movie. Yes, we would buy the movie. The music in the beginning could fit the title and be a little more heavy, but thats cool!!"
3,Not Black Enough,"The highlight of this movie is the wry humour of the well-acted McDonalds characters. Transposed into a blacker more frightening movie, this might have been very compelling. The teenage characters are irritating to the point that when they start getting knocked off its actually more of a relief than anything else. Unfortunately much of the work is left undone and far too many of them escape the farm. The plot is decent enough but the movie isn't really black enough to make it a good teen horror. Overall its reasonably enjoyable to watch, but very much let down by a cheesy/happy ending that won't see it taken seriously by fans of this genre."
3,DECENT ENOUGH,"Ah, Blockbuster, the perfect place to find that perfect slasher flick for the whole family. Slash is one of those rare movies that is so bad, it's actually good! A blah rock band named...go ahead...guess...Slash, is performing at some rundown, no-name nightclubs. Suddenly, a relative of one of the members dies, so the whole band heads out to BFE/hometown of the band member, for the funeral. But little does the rest of the band know that one of them has a horrible secret. As a boy, one of them accidentally set his father on fire after discovering he's a cold-blooded killer, and he's been traumatized by it ever since. And to top it all off, someone in scarecrow drag and wearing a metal mask, is offing them (in particularly bloodless ways) one-by-one. Face it, people, this isn't Saw...heck, it's not even Texas Chainsaw Massacre Part 2, it's just a fun horror flick for you and your buddies to rent and watch late at night. reccomended."
4,Eee-aiy-ee-OOOHHH!,"I rented this flick really expecting it to just be another B Horror flick that I would eventually lose interest in and do something else while it played, but surprisingly enough I was taken in by it! The beginning itself was pretty interested for some reason or another, and the whole film itself eventually developed into a tale of bizarre events and pretty cool kills. Also the killer, Jethrow, was very original and looked like a cross between the Creeper, Leatherface, and Death (i.e. the cloak, the face, and the scythe). The acting was more than I expected it to be though some if it got kind of cheesy, especially during the sex scene in the beginning. That was very corny. Apart from the good acting there were some fine chicks in this film, one of them has appeared in a few films now such as the Rundown and Hidalgo. Anyway, this is a very enjoyable film, and I definitely want to pick up the DVD."
1,"Heavy riffs and Gravity defying solos can't make up for Slash""s uptight acting!",PLOT: Slash gets mad at axle and goes on a murderous killing spree. Then he does some pretty intense guitar solos. SOLOS:5 STAR ACTING:1 STARRECOMMENED: ANYTHING WITH BURT RENOLDS
3,Uh............so where's Melanie?,"I inquired of Amazon if they had any (ahem) ""product"" of my favorite actress, Melanie Anton. They directed me to this movie. Is she in it? What does she do? She's not one of the ""victims"" is she?"
5,divine is the right word,Born in NEW JERSEY SARAH VAUGHAN had a special connection with GERSHWIN's music and the two songbooks she made in the fifties is among her greatest recordings.She was at the time at the peak of her career.Her voice simply becomes an instrument as she plays with it like a child with his toy.When SARAH really wanted to sing nobody could match her perfect timing she is the ultimate singer.Her records however shows that she could be erratic from times to times.This i think is due to her character which was not easy to deal with as was often the case with divas.These records are my own personnal favourites of hers.They are treasures to cherish.With them she will survive eternally.
3,TERROR !! DESTRUCTION !! BEWARE !!!,"THis is another ""prophetical"" book about the economic end of the world. I don't care if everything the author says will be true. One thin I know for sure: the companies are fireing their employess at will, while their profits keep on growing and growing all the time. Why they do that ? Because capitalism has put down his mask and shown what it really is. Unfortunately, nobody has shown us a better form to live economically, so each one of us must do our best to survive without depending upon the god damned companies !!!"
4,"Job Displacement, Period","Fast forward, December 2008, and the impending economic collapse of America. Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs lost, millions of service sector jobs, near collapse of domestic auto industry, housing and mortgage meltdown, credit card crunch, trillion dollar government bailouts. Most of these jobs will NEVER return. What are all these displaced workers going to do for sustenance? Mr. Rifkin nailed it in this book: The Rise of a Massive Welfare State. That day has arrived. Technology didn't do it, I don't think. Rampant greed and colossal corruption on all levels, including the financial industry and lack of government regulation sent this country over the cliff in a short order of time."
3,End of work as we know it....,"Not the best social economic labor book that I've read but Rifkin has done a credible job of explaining the inevitable in next century labor economics. There is a special chapter for those groups affected by urban gentrification, world economic changes and policies. The author has good examples of what happens when work is limited, mobile and international, when labor is cheap expendable and desrepected...when corporate environments perpetuate greed, corruption and destruction...."
2,"Pessismistic view of the future - Interesting, but flawed.","Pessimistic view of the future, where technology has eliminated most jobs as we know them. He sees downsizing as a trend which will continue into the future. It is, indeed, true that ""jobs"", as we remember them, are a thing of the past (cf. Wm Bridges, J. Bardwick, J. Wallulis, Chas. Handy, D. Rousseau). However, Riftkin's view is unneccessarily pessimistic. He sees this trend away from ""jobs"" as something that may lead to anarchy or, at the very least, a de-globalization of the working world reorganized into a community-based, third sector. This premise is interesting but flawed. Rifkin fails to see the positive consequences of this important trend. Research and thought in this area does not support Rifkin's premise."
4,I hope he is not right.,The logic behind the book is pretty consistent and he supports his assesments with reliable data. He calls indirectly for the need of political intervention to avoid the process of technification to go to far creeating an enormous underclass of technologically illiterate people all over the World. It is worth reading.
3,Rifkin is a neo-Malthusian,"This book was ok in that it did a good job in describing workplace dislocations caused by new technology, but in many ways, its the same old situation. If one is looking for a very clearly articulated portrayal of these dislocations in the modern time, then one will like this book. I disagree with all of the doom and gloom, however. This sort of doom and gloom reminded me of the Malthus's writings about overpopulation and fears of machinery in the late 19th century, both of which I view as very discredited observations.There will always be dislocations as result of technological progress; and as tragic as it is, one cannot progress without rendering something obsolete. But we are nowhere near a post-market nor a post-scarcity era."
4,My New Guilty Pleasure,"I came upon this book having no prior experience with the work of Louis L'Amour. Now I am a convert, and will eagerly search out other novels and short stories by this great American storyteller. Written in stirring yet simple prose, this collection of nine short stories is a perfect antidote for too many ""serious"" books. Each tale presents a new cast of memorable characters, and usually offers a riveting moment when true courage is summoned against odds. If the tropes seem familiar, dont blame L'Amour! Even a casual reading will reveal that Hollywood has often borrowed from the great Louis L'Amour."
4,Good stories that make the joy of fairy tales modern.,"In this book, the author tells her stories with the humor and down to earth style one would get if they were dicussing the tale with a friend over a cup of tea. The stories are fun, and creative. Who whould ever guess that a girl would turn down magical presents because she was content with her life? Then instead of marrying a prince, she goes to college. What a twist when another young girl is able to jump in a painting and meet it's inhabitents. Imagine a young bully changing his ways because dreams allow him to view himself through the eyes of others. Although the stories are based on classical fairy tales, the women are smart, strong, and empowered. There are no helpless maidens being rescued here."
4,Great cozy collection of short stories,"This is a great collection of short stories. It's fluffy and fun and has a magical twinkle in its eye. ;) I think it'd be great to read aloud at bedtime, or to give to bookworms in their Christmas stocking."
4,Great Read and a Good Poker Tournament Primer,"I just finished in half-a-day reading Duke's 2005 book (260 pages). I couldn't put it down. It was a great read about her life, family and poker career. It included worthy advice on how to play better poker and was well-well worth the time invested.Her current (March 2012) $4.4-million lifetime tournament earnings ($1.4-million of it in WSOP events) including a WSOP bracelet against the best that the poker world has to offer speaks for itself."
3,Fun Read,"Fun and entertaining read. This book is not a ""How to Win"" manual. Rather as the title suggests, a story on how Annie won. Fast and Easy read."
4,Good read,"A must-have for any poker fan. Annie Duke is one of the most visible figures in the game and this autobiography provides a great insight into her life told in her own words. She exposes almost every facet of her personality, from her continuing battle with anxiety to her unyielding drive to win. The only slight negative to this book is that she repeatedly builds herself up. She carries a tremendous chip on her shoulder. Annie also appears arrogant at times, which is one of the principal criticisms other poker players have of her. All told, however, this is yet another great poker book that belongs in the collection of a serious player."
4,"Great bio, okay poker book","This is a great story, and deserves telling. It's split about 50/50 between Annie's personal life and her poker experiences. Both of these are compelling. If you're mainly interested in becoming a better poker player, there are much better books out there. If you're interested in the poker lifestyle, though, this is the book for you."
4,As expected,"As I expected, this audio CD was mostly a biography of Annie Duke. I found her story to be interesting. There is some strategy discussed for Hold Em' and Omaha which is good for beginners to intermediate players. There is some foul languagein the book but not too much."
5,Poker Strategy Weaved into Annie's Fascinating Life Story,"An engaging and well-written first person account of Annie's journey into professional poker, weaved with practical advice, and highlights of her ups and downs at the highest stakes poker tables. Whether you want to learn more about poker, learn more about Annie, or both, you'll love this book!"
3,Too similar to Poker Face,"If you've read Poker Face by Katy Lederer (Annie Duke's sister) you may feel like you got cheated. Many of the details of the poker celeb's life overlaps between the two books. The first person narrative feels as if it was written by a ghost writer. (Although the writing is very good from a technical point of view.) Annie must be an extraordinary woman, possibly a super woman to play the tournament circuit, promote her book on tour, raise four children, work-out, and still have energy left at the end of the day. If all is true, she definitely deserves a tribute through a biography."
3,I only looked this book,"I only browsed through this book and while it has some good stories it has some flaws in them that just don't seem true. I don't normally posts reviews, but I want to make clear to these review readers that these reviews seem really fishy and well written. I think people are writing some of these reviews, because they are friend's of Annie's. Notice how short, but well written the other reviews are (and their first reviews)...it seems way too fishy for a book I didn't like while skimming. For a good laugh read Royal Straight Flush's review. It's pretty obvious they are just pumping up her book for money."
3,Flat Hard-Boiled Wannabe,"From the very beginning this struck me as a movie masquerading as a book. The transformation of a knockabout used-car salesman in suburban Sao Paolo into a respected killer-for-hire takes all of a chapter or so in this deadpan story. The killer starts his newfound career by shooting a local bully in the back, and quickly works his way up in the world (a la Scarface) by be drawn into spearheading a neighborhood protection racket. He's a rather unpleasant guy,..., and pretty much bullying people who get in his way. Although he keeps making noises about wanting to settle down, it's never clear what that means to him, or which women that means being with. The distanced tone makes the whole story sort of flat, and it fails to connect with the reader in any meaningful way. It's a decent attempt at Brazilian hard-boiled-...--but it doesn't quite work."
5,EVERYONE DOESN'T HAVE TINY FEET,"I take a 10 woman's shoe, but the large sizes are too short and cause pressure on my toes. The x-Lg Isotoners are just what the doctor ordered. They look good, wash nicely, and are comfortable. I have a tendency to walk outside with my slippers on, so the washable nature of the slipper is pretty important. Wandering around in the garden patch in one's bedroom slippers is probably not too common, but I confess I have been there a time or a hundred. These are cozy, basic and well-made slippers in my estimation."
3,beautiful slippers,they are really nice slippers but they run smalli cannot return them so i am really stucki wear a 8.5 and i bought the large too badi should have bought the xlarge
2,size chart,I needed to check the slipper size chart in order to make a purchase. The size chart provided is for women's apparel not the advertised slippers. This add left me with cold feet.
1,below isotoner standards,"I was given this product as a gift and was sorely disappointed in the quality after having washed them. The stuffing on the bottom of each slipper bunched up and I was unable to get it to flatten out, even after wearing it a few times. The fact that the L and R (for identifying whether or not is a left or right footed slipper) on the underneath or bottom side of the slipper is not helpful once the bottom is dirty or darkened. I wouldn't buy this product, however I do prefer and purchase the terry ballerina slippers--much better sole plus the chevrons on the side of each slipper for identifying right or left."
3,I wish it were a bit longer and taller at the heal.,"I wear a size 10 shoe and this is a bit short for me, not uncomfortable but I would like a bit more length. It hits my heal half way so that it feels like my the slipper may slide off my heal. If I had tried these slippers on in a store I would not have purchased them. The sole is comfortable."
5,My favorite slippers!,"I really love these slippers, from the cotton terry to the flexible soles. They are so comfortable, and they wash really well in the washing machine."
4,"Comfort slippers, good fit","I have enjoyed these slippers in another color, and wanted another pair. They are very comfortable. I wear them instead of shoes in the house."
4,isotoner slippers,"The slippers were just what I* ordered. The price was right, also. I wonder, though how big the large would have been. I probably needed a half size in between."
2,disappointing,"I have worn isotoner slippers forever; these are not of the same quality as isotoners have historically been. Most disappointing is the fact that there is no ""left foot"" or ""right foot;"" there are two, uni-foot slippers."
1,Disappointed with service,"I ordered three pair of identical slippers, two of which were incorrectly sized. I contacted the seller twice and never got a response. I filed a complaint with amazon and the situation was resolved within two weeks. This is the first time I've run into problems with a seller and was pleased with amazon's response to my dilemma. As for the seller, I'll not do business with this seller again."
3,comfy,"They are your typical ballerina slipper,comfortable but nothing spectacularfair price & wasjed pretty we;;.. they will do..would have rathered Black"
4,Great Slipper,"Great little slipper when lounging around the house.The material is soft (like sweat-suit) and slipper is flexible.The only issue I have with slipper is that contrary to other reviewers who stated it ran small I believe it ran big. I where a 6 1/2-7 in women's shoe's so I ordered a Medium slipper. I have about an inch of empty space in my slipper so I am glad I didnt order a size up based on other reviews.I would recommend this slipper. Haven't washed it yet, that will be the real test!"
3,Harmonic chops,"3 1/2Picture Stevie Wonder coming in to jam on harmonica with a Wynton Marsalis trio and you'll have a decent starting point. Breezy, jazz-blues which do not jump out at you with astonishment but remains sophisticatedly mellow throughout."
4,"Entertaining, if somewhat simple","At first read, the simplicity and black-and-white of the book is what I noticed, but by the end, the Godly lessons and characters, if not plot, won me over. Plus, I like the website and that there is finally a Christian book series out there that has to do with the Internet!"
4,...,"This is a great novel for teen girls.It is mysterious,suspenseful and features christianity and bible verses as well as an incredibly nice character.She was too nice,WAAAAy too nice,for her own good.That guy who was angry because she didn't let him cheat off his paper...you'll never know how badly I wanted to see his teeth knocked out.Well,ahem anyway,who is threatening Treesap(I mean Amber :) ) via e-mails?"
2,some work/some don't,"I have used this model of Holmes Ultrasonic humidifiers for years. One lasted about 5 years. It can be used with or without the cartridge filter (which is bacteriostatic, and a good idea theoretically.) I gave one to my mother, and that one is in its second year and working well. On the other hand, I ordered one directly from Holmes in January, and it came and NEVER WORKED. The company was difficult to deal with...said they would replace it if I paid $10, but then admitted it was back-ordered and it would be MONTHS until they could replace it. They wanted to give me a cool mist, wick-type unit which I did not want. They would not refund my money until I wrote to my VISA card and made a formal complaint against them. It took months for them to finally refund my money for the unit and for filters that they never shipped. So, do not buy directly from the company! -CB"
1,Avoid Holmes,"Compared to many reviewers here, I have been lucky because this humidifier worked for six months before it died today! I bought mine from a local WalMart, but should have checked the reviews before buying it. I had a Sunbeam ultrasonic humidifier for 4.5 years before I accidentally broke the tank six month ago. From now on, I will avoid Holmes brand.To follow up: I bought one ultrasonic humidifier at Walgreens after writing this review. It was branded as Walgreens but made by Sunbeam. It is really high quality product and looks very cute."
2,Creates puddle of water or wet carpet,"Major problem with this unit is the mist it creates falls to the floor and wets carpet or creates a puddle on hard floors. The only way I found to avoid this is to place the unit a few feet above the floor.On the good side, the filter is cheap, around $5.00. It is fairly quiet. It probably doesn't take a lot of power to run.I much prefer my warm mist humidifier that allows you to set the humidity you want the room to be, and there is no filter to replace!"
1,User Unfriendly Design,"I haven't had the same problems as the other reviewers; it does put out a satisfactory stream of humid air, BUT the intake valve is junk. It disintegrated badly over the summer, and it can't be replaced. You have to buy a whole new tank. Customer service insisted it was my fault for not leaving the tank open during summer storage, but I have another unit I purchased from Brookstone probably 15 years ago, which never had this problem. It's just a cheap material and a very flawed design. I get mad every time I have to fill the darned thing. When the rubber valve falls apart completely, I'm trashing the entire unit."
1,Bad product and bad service.,"my Holmes humidifer was broken (no mist) after 3 months. I did send it with a check of $7 more than 2 months ago, and haven't receive information from Holmes.I emailed to ask my case and they tried to fool around.I am desperate!Very bad product and bad service! I never buy Holmes product again!"
1,"Bought two, both quite after 3 weeks",I bought two of these and within 3 days of each other they both stopped putting out any moisture. What a waste of my time and effort!
4,I'm VERY Happy With My Holmes Humidifier!!!,"I recently purchased this Humidifier (about a month ago) and I have to say overall I'm very happy with it. I haven't had any of the problems other people are saying they had in here except for the soaking of the floor from it. I raised the humidifier about 6 to 7 feet from the ground (placed it on a shelf) and since then it hasn't wet the floor. From my experience, all Ultrasonic Humidifiers that shoot mist wet everything under it. I also have a Sumbeam 701 that does the same thing BUT overall I'm very happy with that also. If you place this (Holmes) humidifier in the right area and high enough from the floor, it'll work excellant. Overall I Highly Recommend this humidifier."
1,"Works great, FOR A WEEK!","I had high hopes. We had a steam humidifier and, in retrospect, it worked great. A little noisy. A pain to clean. But it worked. I bought this humidifier and set it up. Heaven. Quiet, cool steam, fantastic. Then after a week there was no mist. I cleaned it, changed the water, wiped it down, even begged it but no go. The fan still works, but without the mist, it's just a decorative door stop. I'll try to get it fixed and go through the nightmare of sending it back to the company but I'm not enthusiastic.Next up, a cool mist humidifier with next to no moving parts. Wish me luck."
4,Good buy!!!,Great product. We are using it in my daughters room almost every night especially in the winter months when its very dry from the heat. I love that you can adjust the fan strength level and moisture output and it lasts the whole night and some. Great buy!!!
1,"Humidifies the floor, not the air","I originally bought this humidifier because it was smaller than the Bemis humidifier I already owned and because it runs quietly (I wanted to keep it in the bedroom to run at night). While the unit fit nicely in the small space I had available for it, and while it was indeed very quiet, the mist this humidifier produces did not disperse into the air but instead fell to the floor--and soaked it. I tried it in three places: first on the floor in my bedroom (where I'd kept the other humidifier I was using), next on my nighttable, and finally on a table in my living room over a hardwood floor (in the hopes that a less absorbent surface would be less likely to soak up the mist). In all three cases, the result was the same: a puddle on the floor beneath the unit. I returned it today and bought a second Bemis humidifier to replace it."
1,Piece of Junk,I bought this item and and was initally happy but after less than a month of use it stopped providing mist. I bought another as a replacement and it was dead out of the box. I called Holmes to have them replaced and they wanted me to pay $20 to have them replace THEIR defective products. After much annoyance they waived that fee and told me my replacements would be shipped in TWO months. Are you kidding me!!!. The product is a piece of junk and the company apparently doesn't care about customer service. If I never buy another piece of #@%^#$ from Holmes again it will be too soon!
2,I Don't Recommend This Unit,"It is pretty quiet and puts out a considerable amount of mist. But there are problems.1) Despite the fact that it comes with a demineralization cartridge that is supposed to eliminate white dust, there is white dust all over my furniture, and especially electrontic equipment.2) The unit is designed with many nooks and crannies that make it quite difficult to clean. And you will have to clean it regularly, since brownish gunk accumulates frequently.3) The opening to fill the water tank is too small to insert a normal sized hand, so it is impossible to wipe clean inside.4) As other reviewers have noted, a lot of the mist simply falls to the ground around the unit.5) Do not under any circumstances move the humidifier around while the tank is in place with water in it, or it is very easy for the water to overflow into the air vent and go down inside the base with the electrical components and short them out. This happened to me, and the unit promptly died."
1,Disaster!,"It worked for about 2 weeks at lowest setting. Consider that the company has no local repair shop. You need to pay to send it to the company plus pay them to send it back to you... Sure nobody will want to do this as this cost almost as much as the humidifier. If I could have chosen less than ""one star"" for my rating, I would have done it... Life is too short to waste money on a bad product from a bad company!"
1,Mine is still working but...,"I bought mine 6 months ago to put in the baby room and it is still working. However, I'm getting rid of it today...I tried so hard to keep this thing clean but it's IMPOSSIBLE! You can't put your hand in the tank and the sensor is stuck in a corner which makes it pretty much impossible to clean to base without bending the sensor...This is the worst humidifier EVER."
1,"Just a very bad product, avoid it.","We bought three of these things for Xmas replacement for some older evaporative types types. The first worked about a week out the box, I thought that was a fluke. The second one worked only for the first fill of water before failing. The third is still in the box, but now I see all these recent December reviews that other are having problems too. CAN YOU SPELL CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. There is enough posting right here to prove a good case of bad product design. We want a refund, not an excuse and we want it from Amazon as the seller. They can deal with maker.Update: All three went back to Amazon, painless and professional. I noticed a ton of new negative reviews have appeared since. Drop this product. We still need replacements, but this maker is not of the list of those we will considering."
1,Great when it was working,My unit worked great for 30 days running from about 6:30 am til 10:00 pm every day. Then it quit. It's clean and the blower is working but no mist. I guess it really is junk as suggested by others.
3,Others had this problem too!?,"Ok - so I was online looking for another humidifer - and I saw the SAME one we just had. Weeeeellll, ours sort of died. The gasket in the tank thing - wore out - and basically the thing floods the floor because there is nothing to stop the water from pouring out. I thought the 'vapor' action was AWESOME. We ran in the bedroom on full blast - and by the end of the evening (~ 6 hours?) all of the windows had condensation on them. I loved it while it was alive - but now that I know others had this problem too - I guess I am going to look for another option for 'vapor' - we've had a cool mist one - they just don't compete with the amount one like this puts out - unfortunately this one died..."
1,bad experience,"How long do you expect this thing to work? My anwser is: at least one year. However this stupid thing won't. Bad experience with the soaking problem and gauge of the tank. The small plastic gauge is always leaking.Conclusion: looks nice, but not worth your money, even a dime."
1,Wheres the mist?,"We bought this humidifier and it worked great....for about 4 hours. Then it stopped producing mist completely. Now we are about to try the second one, but judging from the other reviews here, Im not expecting much!"
1,Didn't give it a zero since........,.....the puddle around it is not big enough to swim.Hint: use sunday newspaper to save the carpet
1,Poor quality,"I bought this humidifier from another place a few days ago. It was very quiet during working. However, it broke after the first night's use. They gave you a manul with tons of ""DON'T DO"" in the instructions. I followed all of them, but it still died vey quickly. What shall I say about this? The quality is really poor. Just do not understand why they can not make this simple gadget more reliable. Is this really a hi-tech thing?"
1,Piece of junk,"I bought two of these when my two-month old twins had colds. The best thing I can say about this humidifier is it did help their congestion. Unfortunately, it completely drenches everything (babies, furniture, floor, rugs, etc.). I tried putting down vinyl cloths followed by every blanket and towel I own. Everything is totally drenched in the morning including our laminate floor. The laminate floor is now damaged despite all of our precautions. I went out and purchased the Vicks humidifiers which don't drench everything but don't seem to work very well either. I'm on the search for something else."
5,Really good - only a little smudgy,"I have these extra fine point pens in purple, black and blue. The ink doesn't dry immediately, so occasionally smudging is a problem. Seems like it's more of an issue with the medium point pens rather than the extra fine. I use these in my Moleskine and they have a really nice flow to them."
5,"Love, Love, Love Them!",I found these and started using them at work. I can't tell you how much I love them. This is the best pen I have ever used! It looks great and I love the flow in how it writes!
2,Eh. Not so great...,"This was great at first. My kid wont use other sippies where she has to tilt her head back so this one seemed to be the perfect sippy. BUT it leaks all the time, crud gets stuck in the straw and you really have to work to get it out (milk is terrible), and now it is mildewing (ew). So we are done. Moving on to the Munchkin straw cups."
2,Looks pretty but not functional,"I bought this in hope of my son will be able to drink milk from this cup. It was useless after I took it apart and had to wash it. I tried so hard to putting it back together. But, it still leaks. I basically toss it out after many times of trying. What a waste of money."
3,Great cups not childproof,"We love these cups for ease of travel, however once thrown from the high chair the bottoms along with the handles tend to pop off. After a riggerous couple of weeks they tend to leak from the top. We like'em but they need to be replaced way too much."
2,"Good cup, but made of unsafe plastic","My son really likes this cup, but I found out it is made of polycarbonate plastic, which is known to be toxic. So I threw it out and bought the larger flip n' sip cups, which are made of safe polypropylene plastic. My only comlaint is that they don't have handles and are a little big. If only Nuby made a PP version of the 2 handled sip n' flip!"
3,O.K. Movie,This movie is o.k. for me but my two year old will not sit and watch five minutes of it even though she LOVES dogs.
4,Love dogs? Then you will love this movie.,"This movie is cute and predictable. Foster brother and sister have mean foster parents, start adopting dogs and hide them in an old hotel. Much madness follows with a sweet and happy ending. Kids will love this movie!!"
3,Dogs in this film are almost human,I'm not a dog person but I bought the film for my brother who has kept canine companions for 30 or more years now. It was entertaining to see dogs treated royally and saved from early deaths. Often very cute scenes.
4,Entertaining movie,"It is quite unrealistic but I found it very entertaining. I thought it had a good moral to the story and the dogs are really cute. As a long time dog trainer, I am amazed that they got all of those dogs to do all of those tricks. It portrays dogs as being smarter than people which in many ways they are just not in the ways they were in the movie. I enjoyed the movie a lot."
2,Boring,"The trailer looked good and made it seem like the movie would be fun. In reality, it was boring and totally unrealistic. I didn't bother to finish watching."
4,Great Kids Movie,"I took my granddaughter to see this movie in the theater...immediately following the show...she looked at me and said ""we have to get this one on DVD"". Enough said! ; o)"
5,Excellant,The movie was great. My grandchildren loved it. Amazon shipped it right away. This is the best way to get your movies.
4,Hotel for Dogs,"I found this DVD quite entertaining. Not quite what I expected as the dogs don't talk as in Air Buddies, snow Buddies & Space Buddies but all the same well worth watching. My granddaughter Jessica, who is nearly 4 years of age, thoroughly enjoyed it."
2,"arf arf, arf arf arf","Kids love dogs. How else to explain the success of last December's Marley & Me or this nondescript comedy based on the Lois Duncan bestseller? In it, two foster kids secretly adopt a dog and when he runs away, they find him in an abandoned hotel along with a few other strays. Naturally, they decide to care for all of them and hilarity ensues. By the way, if you enjoyed the book, a sequel is coming out soon. I'll bet a sequel comes out for the movie as well."
4,Hotel for Dogs,"What a wonderful, feel-good movie! I saw this on TV and knew I had to have it my library. Of course the dogs steal the movie - but the humans are wonderful, too. This movie is just fun. MGW"
4,cute movie,I bought this movie to try to appease my niece. She watched it 3 times. I thought it was adorable. Highly recommended for it feel good movie
4,Hotel for Dogs,This is a great family movie. Just darling with a good message for all. We highly recommend it even for people without a dog.
5,great family movie,"Another one to share with the kids--and the dogs will pull at your heart strings too. Made me want to run down to the pound and adopt the lot of them...Cute movie, even keeps the adults entertained."
4,Super Cute Movie,This movie suprised me on being so cute and well done. This is a great gift for any dog lover.
3,"Okay, but not great.","Took my 14-year-old son, my 11-year old daughter and my [censored] year-old mother. (All three dog lovers.)My son was bored, my daughter and mom liked it.The movie had some cute moments, but it wasn't as good as some reviewers are giving it ... certainly not a classic.Definitely good for kids from 6-10. Nice to see a movie that doesn't have obscene/sexualized jokes."
2,Very weak,"Most of the details of this movie have been covered in other reviews. There three issues with this movie. First of all, the kids exhibit criminal behavior from beginning to end of the film. Apparently, this is all completely excused by the end of the film, because it was all in a good cause. I would have felt a lot better about the kids if they had actually gone out and got a job and taken care of their dog in that manner. Second, the whole plot is really weak. The kids have no money, but some how have enough money to put together an amazing number of contraptions and get the power turned on in an old hotel. If they had that money to begin with, why are they pawning rocks for twenty bucks? Finally, the acting is not very good. Kids exhibit little emotion and the adult characters are two dimensional, to say the least.The only saving grace of the movie are the dogs which are well trained and cute."
5,Hotel For Dogs,"This was one of the cutest movies we've seen in a long time. Great for the entire family. Made you laugh, made you cry!"
5,Very good movie for kids and adults,"My grandsons and I really enjoyed this movie, and will definitely watch it again. After seeing it at my house, they talked their patents into buying the DVD - we rented it using the Amazon streaming site."
3,hotel for dogs,"This is a cute little movie for kids. it is definitely contrived and unrealistic but it has a cute ending. For once there is a movie made that the whole family can enjoy. It's sweet. refreshing, heart warming and just a feel good movie."
4,Addicting!!!!,"Never Look a Gift Fish was my introduction to the wonderful world of Patrick F. McManus. Each story had me remembering similar incidents in my life, only mine were not near as entertaining.While listening to these tapes during a cross-state drive to a football game, I caught myself driving slower as I approached my destination because I did not want to have to wait until the return trip to continue listening.It is ironic that many of his stories are based on fishing because I, for one, am HOOKED!!"
4,Never Sniff a Gift Fish,"I love all his books that I've read. He has a real gift for humor. My husband and I would read them out loud--it became a game. As soon as one of us started laughing too hard to read it was the other person's turn. We traded often, and shared stories with friends."
5,UNSPEAKABLE JOY!,"This is one of Sarah's greatest CD's. The title is very appropriate -- I have that misty feeling right now listening to the music. It is so satiny, but not fluffy; the music has so much substance and texture and the ""Divine One"" really gives a great performance. If you love great music, then buy this album, NOW! This is Sarah's classical, ballad side at its best. And with Quincy Jones conducting and arranging, the album is quite polished."
5,"Seamlessly enchanting, brilliant!","Hastily, after purchasing this album I silenced the room. Iimmediately was struck my the operetic nature of Ms. Vaughan's voiceas it flowed so effortlessly over and through octaves. ""Please Be Kind"" is angelic, as is ""Live for Love,"" [dare I say] the ubiquitous ""Misty,"" and ""Blue Orchids."" ""I'll Close My Eyes"" is one of my favorite intimate ballads on the disc, offering sentimental value, while ""That's All"" lends whimsy to the album. It is impossible to deny Ms. Vaughan compliments for her melodic contours, colorful and dreamy, even. The first half of the disc, to me, is the better for its lack of the unflattering background singers.Here, her voice is maturer than her introductory ""Body and Soul"" or ""Time After Time"" while not yet reaching the vibratoed lows of her latter career. Certain a winner for those who prefer either side of Sass. Buy it and fall in love all over again with a true vocalist."
4,Better,"A prequel to Humphrey's Jack Absolute, this is a bildungsroman set during the Seven Years War. Humphrey's character is drawn from a character in Sheriden's The Rivals. This is a better written and more detailed book than its predecessor. Both characterization and historical detail are handled better."
5,A Wonderful Experience,"I origianlly bought this album in the middle 1980's on an LP album, and I about wore it out. When I saw it on Amazon, I bought the CD immediately----Like the other reviewers here, I agree that it is some of Andy's best recorded music. I had the pleasure of hearing Andy sing ""Words"" at one of his touring Christmas shows in 1985, and it was as stunning as the recording here.I have been an Andy Williams fan since the early 60's, heard him many times in concert, and have bought about all of his recorded music. This album is a wonderful example of the quality of music Andy has graced the world with over his wonderful career. Make sure you have it in your collection."
5,Two masterpieces in one CD,"Those two LPs provide a wonderful insight into Nina's musical world: beautiful ballads, thrilling blues, fun rythm & blues and jazz tunes, protest songs, gospels... Nina fills African-American music with countless emotions and with a sincere, truthful vision of life (sometimes very harshly, as in ""Four women"", an awesome Nina's composition, or in ""Let it all out"", sometimes with a sweet melancholy, as in ""Don't you pay them no mind""). A bittersweet masterpiece that won't only delight your ears, but will also make you think about life."
3,Cantonese Anyone?,"First of all, I have to give credit to anyone who writes a book explaining the pronunciation of cantonese. However, this book would be more useful as a reference or supplement guide to those learning cantonese but already know the basics of the language. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners, but it wouldn't hurt to have it if you're looking to expand your vocabulary."
3,Good for quick basic phrase lookup,"Have found this useful for basic phrases and general conversation, however for anything harder, I've had to go back to a more authoritative source, a native-Cantonese speaker to get the info that I'm looking for. This isn't good for learning as such, but it is a useful tool if you know some cantonese already to reinforce what you know for general converstaion and also if you are stuck in Hong Kong with the characters being alongside the romanization for easy pointing to the locals if you are having trouble with the tones."
5,Very Pleased,I ordered this cd as a christmas gift for my dad. He didn't think it was possible to get hold of it. He loved it. The entire transaction was prompt and smoothe.
1,Pastel Blues/Let It All Out,My CD was scratched even though it was sold as factory sealed. For me that meant that it should not have been scratched and four of the tracks un-listenable. I am not happy with the purchase.
4,Helpful guide to Gorge hikes,"If you love hiking and live in the Columbia Gorge area (or plan to pass through) this is a nice guide to have. I learned of hiking trails I didn't know existed and the Gorge seems to have plenty of them. Each hike is listed with a general description, the distance of the trail, how much traffic of people to expect there, the best season to go, the elevation gain and maximum elevation. A map is shown and directions to the hike are given along with detailed description of the hike. Many black and white photographs show views from the various hikes. My one disappointment with this book is that the Deschutes River trail that is branched off directly from the Columbia River Gorge is not mentioned in this book, because it is east of The Dalles; this book only mentions the trails from Portland to The Dalles."
2,Cranium Let Down!,"I usually love Cranium products. I ordered this for my 5 year old for Christmas. The shoes did not clip-clop at all. The batteries are those small watch batteries, so I did not bother to replace them to see if it would work. We returned it. It was a disappointment for that much money!"
2,"Nice materials, but not a good fit","The shoes do not look as good in person, as they do online. I wear a size 8, and these shoes seem to fit very strangely (they run very large). Your foot slips forward, making the shoes look too big in the heel area. It's cut in such a way that buying a smaller size would not help."
1,A big disappointment,"The case and the included accessories are good. Unfortunately the microscope itself is of very poor quality. The light keeps flickering on and off and won't stay pointing in the proper direction. The optics are junk. My son didn't really learn anything from this, because it is so hard to SEE anything with it."
5,great book for studying!!,"wow! this book is really a miracle book because it helped me pass medsurg class in nursing school, and I just passed my EC medsurg exam as well. It has at least 30Q per chapter, and lots of easy to read explanations.this book was worth every penny. I would give this book a million stars if I had the option! I am definitely a big fan of reviews and rationales!"
4,pretty good,"But not enough practice questions, and some questions that are in the book are repeated in the cd.The made incred easy med surg cd is great for practice questions."
1,Not worth the shipping.,"I got this book as an adjunct to my Saunders NCLEX and the workbooks and clinical guides for my texts during my last semester of nursing school. The rationales for the answers are vague and hard to follow, particularly with more difficult content. It doesn't include multiple patient scenarios, and the questions include a fairly clear ""correct"" answer. If you want to be a good clinician AND pass your NCLEX/school exams, this won't help. Get a good prioritization and delegation book instead, along with the Saunders and a Kaplan book."
5,My buddy Joe,"This is the funnest book, if you can call it that, that I've ""read"" in a long time! Joe is now my pal and goes a lot of places where I know I'll be bored. He's a lot of fun and I would recommend him as a new friend to anyone considering purchasing him."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"What was Clare Fischer thinking when the strings were added separately without Joao being there? As a big fan of Bossa Nova and Joao's.... I was frustrated by listening to this CD. Did Clare Fischer even understand the quality of the music already recorded by Joao or that the listener would be struggling to hear more of just Joao without the ""strings, etc."". There is a very definite beat to all Bossa Nova music which is being hidden by Clare Fischer's arrangements. Do yourself a favor and purchase another of Joao's CDs and skip this one unless you would rather hear strings interfering with the quality of the music already being played. I would like to recommend a better CD however I am still looking for one hence I will be returning this and purchasing another (without the interference of someone mucking up the artist's orginal vision.) If it were possible to give this NO stars... I would have!"
1,Improving Mona Lisa,This record does a great disservice to the artistry of Joao Gilberto as the orchestral arrangement is not only maudlin but also clashes with the artist's performance. It feels as if the producer decided that Gilberto's performance is too subtle and needs to be dumbed down. No -- a great artist like Gilberto does not need the *help* of an arranger.This recording should be deleted from the catalogue. I agree with the previous reviewer -- I would give it a rating of ZERO if I could.
2,Pretentious and Dull,"Personally, I found 8 1/2 to be one of the most boring films I've ever seen. It was a pretentious, self-indulgent trip down the director's memory lane. I understood the plot, and enjoyed some of the thoughts raised near the end, but overall was bored silly by stilted, pointless dialogue.Having said that, the cinematography was stunning and the music almost made the film worth watching. Perhaps 8 1/2 would have been better off as a series of photographs with musical accompaniment :P."
2,What's with the subtitles?,I tried to watch the Criterion edition of this movie knowing how highly regarded it is.I found that while the movie has considerable dialogue (and fast Italian dialogue) the subtitles seems to only be present for very little of it--with some sentences seeming to not even be completed. It is fragmentary at best.I find the movie unwatchable as I am staring to try to understand the movie (which is complex enough as it is) and feeling frustrated. Is this a flaw on my copy or is this the way this edition is?I normally have no trouble with subtitles and own many foreign films in my collection.
5,Excellent. Recommend Highly.,"I have watched this film about once a month for the past 14 years, and I never get tired of it. A MUST HAVE."
5,The Ultimate Fellini,"Fellini-The name brings about thoughts of rampant symbolism (some planned, some just sitting there going nowhere), pretensious college students that take film WAY too seriously...a name that, like Kurosawa, gets bandied around by people with a love for the ART of filmaking...well, love him or hate him, Fellini was a true filmaker as artist. On one hand an almost Cervantes-like artist that set out to decimate the old standards, yet paradoxilly created a whole new set of 'em. ""8 1/2"" still stands as a great film and, probably, the ultimate Fellini movie. That's not to say his best, but definately the one to introduce his unique style with."
3,Criterion transfer much better,"First off, its one of the 10 greatest movies. If you have any interest in the history of cinema, its a must-view. However, the Image Entertainment single disc edition suffers from a decent transfer of a mediocre print, with much distracting dust and emulsion chipping present. The Criterion 2 disc version, while weighed down by a second disc of less interesting documentaries issue appears to have far fewer print defects. IMHO the commentaries and better transfer make the Criterion disc a better purchase."
1,The Emperor has no clothes,"It's really quite amusing reading all of the fawning encomia to this pretentious piece of garbage. Because this film's reputation is based on a top-down critical diktat rather than on inherent quality, most of these reviews either cite some sort of authority (Roger Ebert, the Academy Awards, some frou frou list of the greatest ""films"" of ""cinema"") to justify their adulation, or they seem to be quoting accolades and analysis from some film-history textbook. The sheep can't bleat their loyalty to received judgement fast enough. After two viewings, I have found nothing of value in 8 1/2. This movie consists of glamourous Italians going here and there talking about_nothing_, with occasional surrealistic hallucinations interspersed. This entire movie is a cheap trick, and that will be acknowledged in a more honest era. In the meantime, it is our duty, like the little child, to proclaim very loudly that the Emperor is naked! I give this movie negative 8 1/2 stars."
2,Wearing on my patience,"Overrated nonsense. I love arty films, and there are plenty to choose from, but this one is nothing. A director doesn't know what to do with his movie. Alright already. He's boring the hell out of me. For a masterpiece of film, this emperor is in his underwear. This hodgepodge of nonsense just gets on my nerves and wears out my patience. It shouldn't have been over two hours. It should have been 15 minutes.It took three sittings before I could get through it. By the end, as the DVD clock said it was 2:12 into it, I felt betrayed because it was only supposed to be 2:10. It lasted another few stupid minutes. The best moment in the film is when I knew it was finally over. God be praised. This idiocy is over."
1,Nearly unwatchable...,"Without a doubt, the most pretentious, self-indulgent mess of a movie I've ever seen. The high praise showered on this film baffles me."
1,Please God Not Again!,"Every time I watch this movie- or try to watch it- I fall asleep in self-defense. Terrible, boring, not the great masterpiece everyone seems to claim."
1,Unwatchable.. one of world cinema's biggest embarrassments.,"Along with ""Ikiru"" and the migraine-inducingly dull ""Seventh Seal"", we can count this Fellini abomination as another nail in world cinema's coffin, which goes to prove once again how America is the greatest country there is. This 138 minute long ""film"" is not much more than a high budget experiment directed by a 19-year old UArts student. Lacking in any sort of character depth or interesting dialogue, the viewer can expect to be bored to tears by black and white footage of nonstop Italian ramblings by a distressed dork with hipster glasses. If you insist on looking ""intellectual"" by subjecting yourself to foreign films, may I recommend Bollywood's recent output of romantic comedies."
3,incomplete Tracy,"I too was a long-time fan of Dick Tracy ,who at age 18 got a copy of Celebrated Cases...for Christmas. Previously available through Harvey Comics reprints,the availability had long since disappeared to the average fan. After my initial excitement,I quickly realized that the Sunday strips were missing from nearly every story!! On top of that,the editor ended not one but two of the greatest sequences (Brow and Flattop) prior to their actual conclusion.Each continuity went on to have a slam bang ending that the reader does not get to see. Money would be better spent on IDW Publishing of ""The Complete Dick Tracy""."
5,Nothing like it,"one and a half milion versions of ""sunny side of the street"" are out today. After hearing this version I cast all others aside (sorry Ella)."
5,jazz at its best,wow this is the best jazz album i ever heard. giant steps comes close but wow this album is amazing. both sonny's sound great as usualy but its almost as tho they raised their game some. diz sounds great everyone sounds good this is a must buy get this album NOW!
5,Amen to Joe's review!!,"Can't say it any better than the other review, this is a must have for any jazz fan!"
4,"Quite short, but a piece of JAZZ Heaven and History","There is no doubt that this session served to push both Stitt and Rollins to some of their best (""The Eternal Triangle"" for Stitt and Rollins...and ""..Sunny Side.."" finding Rollins compact and captivating in his solo). ""After Hours"" is one of my favorite tunes (called 'the Black National Anthem' by one of my 80+ year old best friends), and while it is played for quite a while - it is literally more than a fourth of the recording - I could listen to Ray Bryant with brother Tommy all night long. This is a great recording, and I wouldn't 'pass it around' without keeping a close eye on it!"
5,A thrilling record with the most thrilling players in it ...,"as a jazz musician (saxophones) music makes me thrill. when i listen to ""sonny side up"" i realise that the greatest players don't have to be techincly geniouses to make you listen to them, they have to thrill you. in this album i get thrill every time i listen to those three geniouses: dizzy, sonny stitt& sonny rollins. the groove you feel in the background of the music, is so hard that it makes you just move and smile. i specialy like the first song ""on the sunny side of the street"" by jimmy mchugh, where stitt plays so cool and and dizzy sings so cool too. also i like rollins's solo on the last song ""i know that you know"". you must listen to it. matti.s."
2,not bad,"this is a nice first effort by the artist mike slack, who began his life in photography by making polaroids out his window to amuse himself on a road trip (his words). the result is a series of interesting snapshots of a quirky, colorful world that may interest many viewers. in terms of photography, there is not much new here, and one might be much better served by getting any one of the many william eggleston, stephen shore, or richard misrach books."
1,Very often frustrating,"I bought this because the first few definitions I looked up were clearly and simply defined. However, as I got to use it more and more, I became increasingly frustrated. I realised that for this Kompaktwörterbuch, Pons had simply extracted a subset of words from the Großwörterbuch without further consideration. Consequently, some definitions are defined using words *not* found in the dictionary. Really, it's unforgiveably careless, and has put me quite off Pons. For example, ""missmutig"" is defined as ""verärgert"", which is not in the dictionary! Another example: ""beißen"" is defined as ""mit den Zähnen erfassen und zerkleinern"" - you guessed it, neither erfassen nor zerkleinern is in the dictionary. However, I give it one star because it's cheap and the layout is excellent."
1,A mess of a movie.,"Amateurish writing and directing. The plot was totally unconvincing, and full of holes. It just sort of rambled along making little dramatic sense. I guess anyone can make a movie these days. Dakota Fanning wandered through the film seemingly lost and looking for a plot, but did the best she could with the poor material, but it was hopeless. Don't waste your time or money with this disaster of a flick."
2,Not since MONSTER'S BALL....,"Not since MONSTER'S BALL have I seen a movie that made we want to conduct a nuclear strike on the Deep South and then hang myself.Since I've been to the south, I wonder if anyting coming out of Hollywood (or Sundance) can be trusted. To filmmakers, the south isn't a region or a people or culture, but a genre that can only be pushed and mutated into exercises in human depravity and despair. I'm sure there are people who live horrible lives...but that's everywhere. And I really don't think another film about addictions, poor white trash, and rape is necessary. Just me.The acting is good. The film looks very professional. The writing...well...life really sucks east of Aspen and Hollywood."
3,Hounddog,"It might have received honors at the Sundance Film Festival, and much press because of a sex scene played by 12 year old Dakota Fanning, but personally I didn't think too much of it. Moreover, it didn't receive much media attention in Hollywood or anywhere else following Sundance, etc."
1,OverRated,"I fell for the hype of this movie.I like Dkota Fanning but this whole movie was a waste of time to watch. Unless your are a fan of girls running around in underwear,whih dakota spends most of the movie in. Made no sence at all only thing going for the film was the landscape."
3,Typical,"story of a naive little girl(dakota)who is obsessed with Elvis and was too free spirited as in the scene she laid on the bed spreading her legs at her would be attacker.Ironically,she lived in the south where rape and incest is normal.She gave her father opportunities before he became a vegetable to take her as well. Her grandmother did'nt want her father to have girlfriends because she wanted to sex him herself.As usual She cant trust or learn from no one but a wise black man,A definate victim of those""good ol"" days.She lost her love for elvis and seemed to have found a path to growing up.Just a movie,and just meerly scratched the surface ofwhat went on back then."
4,"""And you ain't no friend of mine...""","Hounddog starring Dakota Fanning was the film that was panned by critics but I found this coming-of-age drama very poigant. Fanning is the best child actor since Jodie Foster. Robin Wright Penn also stars and she is an amazing actress as well. The much talked about rape scene is not graphic, no nudity is shown especially since Dakota was only 12 at the time. Fanning's character is obsessed with Elvis Presley, through his music - she finds solace and then loses her fragile grip on reality. Slowly but surely she is healed and learns to find her voice again. Heartbreaking story but one worth telling."
3,A mandantory 3 as my top rating,"Why do I rate a film 3 that I really liked? If you have read my other reviews you know. There are no subtitles or closed captions. Every film that is released with out one of these is a slap in the face to everyone that has any sort of hearing difficulty.People have angrily disagreed with me on this policy. The fact is, I don't care so don't waste your time. There is no excuse for a major film to be released on DVD with eith Subtitles of Closed Captions.Otherwise what I could hear of the film was quite good. Ms. Fanning was just born to act."
4,Very Well Done and not the least bit offended,just a quick note to say the story was wonderful and great to see how she dealt with her tragic life.I was not the least be offended or anything like that. This should never have been baned. I was totaly tasteful.
5,You ain't nothing but a Great Actress!,"Wow! What a great movie. This movie really is a well acted movie, especially Dakota Fanning's role.The movie is a little on the racy side with Dakota being so young and such a grisly role for a young actress to portray. Dakota is a great actress and you really felt for her in this movie.A must for any older Dakota fan, or movies that take place in the 1950's southern era.Great sceneryGreat actingGreat musicGreat movie"
3,"Dakota's fab, but the snakes were killing me...","I don't like snakes. I do not like snakes. They were everywhere in this film, and that might be a highlight in this otherwise depressing takle of a young girl's summer. Her father's been injured and made mentally deficient, her mother is dead, and her grandmother (played by the awesome Piper Laurie) is stern and a bit cold. Still, things can always get worse, and they do. It's a said tale of tragic betrayal for a young girl who really wasn't having that good a life to begin with, but Dakota is amazing as always.I just wish I had never seen this movie, that's all. I did really love Robin Wright-Penn though, who doesn't love seeing Princess Buttercup?But seriously, if you hate snakes like I hate snakes, PASS!"
3,Hound dog,The movie depicted things little girls experience that are kept in the dark. I don't want to say educational but it was real.Dakota fanning is talented beyond her years.I liked it. As for a career defining film! nah but it was good.
2,Yawn ... more anti-South cliches,"Although there are some good performances in the film (the main character, the boy who plays Teddy), this is Hollywood 101, where the white men are ignorant, rapists, racists and anti-rock and roll preachers, the neighbors are all sentient, spiritual saints, and the South produces nothing but backward, dysfunctional clans. A textbook film-student's version of what the South has been and is. Films of this ilk have grown tiresome ..."
1,What a sad piece of crap,"The south is nothing like this, never was. Every aspect of the story was unrealistic. The author obviously has never been to the south and just made up their own romantic version. I've seen this happen over and over in films about the south.The only good part was when her dad got struck by lightening. That was hilarious. My sister and I watched that scene like four times. Even that was unrealistic.And what was that nonsense about the snakes in the tall grass? A pitiful attempt at symbolism?I think people like it just for the sexual content because the movie itself was garbage.If your looking for a movie like this just watch Slingblade. It's not realistic either but at least it's funnier."
2,Sugary Poison,"I love southern gothic (like Cormac McCarthy's ""Suttree"") but this film is missing it's only crucial ingredient...truth. The symbolism is very clumsy and the adults hopelessly stereotyped. Like Bjork's ""Dancer In The Dark"" it had me and then it lost me in an ocean of self-indulgent bitterness."
4,Hounddog,I know the critics slammed this movie but I have seen it and it is a beautiful movie about growing up and the real world not the glossed over version that people want to believe exits. For the era that this movie was portraying it smacks with realism. I loved it. It is really worth seeing.
3,Hounddog and it's message,"I watched the film twice. I was curious as to what all the fuss was about regarding Dakota Fanning's role and her status as a minor being exposed to playing a rape scene. I wondered why this could be so different from To Kill a Mockingbird, where several child actors where exposed to the same type of theme, but passively. Both films dealt with rape,one with an actual rape scene, the other with an accusation of rape.But both films contained minor actors exposed to theme of under age rape. And we all know that To Kill a Mockingbird won awards and has been aclaimed as one of the best films ever made. Nobody discussed the minor actor issues.As far as Hounddog as a film, I didn't care for it. The acting was wondeful but I couldn't find a connection to the story. Sorry."
2,Waiting for no. 148,"""In an interactive online course, some content and methods work better than others."" (p.32) Yes, I know this. That's why I bought this book. Do I have to wait for the sequel to actually find out *which* content and methods work better than others?"
1,Extremely Superficial,"This book provides only a superficial look at the complexity of teaching online groups. The 147 tips are not organized in any fashion, and most of them are just plain old common sense."
2,Judging a book by its cover,"First, let me say that the material in this book is valid and helpful. That said, this seems to be a collection of suggestions that any teacher would hear from a mentor-teacher or should have heard in the most basic education class. A few of the ""tips for teaching online groups"": 5) Understand your audience, 23) Be prepared and flexible, 30) Expect learners to be ready to learn, 80) Develop assignments. Don't misunderstand; these are certainly practical tips, but my expectations for a book targeted toward teachers facilitating online classes were not met.Part of my own mistake was buying this book based on the cover and not doing a little bit of research first. Copyrighted in 2000, this book was already eight years old by the time I got it. Some of the philosophical, big-picture ideas are helpful (share your work, promote critical thinking, and use case studies), but not what I was hoping for in a book targeted to as specific of an audience as this one is."
5,Each technique is succinctly presented,"In 147 Practical Tips For Teaching Online Groups: Essentials of Web-Based Education, Donald E. Hanna, Michelle Glowacki-Dudka, and Simone Conceicao-Runlee effectively collaborate to create a practical and succinct compendium of ""tips, tricks and techniques"" for successfully conducting a workshop, seminar or classroom symposium over the Internet. Each technique is succinctly presented and will increase effectiveness for both the teacher and the group discussion participants. 147 Practical Tips For Teaching Online Groups is essential and invaluable reading for anyone charged with the responsibility for using the Internet as a means of instructional contact whether in academia, a corporate in-service, non-profit organizational seminar, or educating an Internet newsgroup or listserv in some particular subject, issue or topic."
4,practical examples of scrum application,"brief description of scrum, followed by several examples of real life scrum application. The book shows different situations for each of scrum rules (scrummaster, product owner, team) and cases of success and failure."
3,"Not bad Scrum reference, but could be better","I had a look at this book hoping it would apply a ""business"" approach to the Scrum interesting ideas.The author tries to do it. While this text offers a lot of stories about real experiences about Scrum deployment and consulting, it does not teach enough practical tools for managers to apply Scrum on their companies. You have to extract too many things on your own.Surprisingly, the some of final appendixes are probably the more interesting stuff... specially the one that exposes the ""Fixed-Price and Fixed-Date Contracts"" point of view versus Scrum.Finally I consider this book as a medium-level reading about Scrum, but people that really want to start with Scrum will find it not too much useful."
1,Written for idiots?...,"Process defined by ""stories""?... Where is the ""Scrum process"" formally defined? I cannot find. I can find only stories about fictitious companies, level of disorder at these companies, and magical Silver Bullet named (but not defined) ""scrum"" that automatically, through long meetings, brings the order and happiness. Probably the level and style of presentations fits well to the level of ""expertise"" and education of average American programmer. And illustrates the trend: departing from rigorous formal methods towards ""blah, blah"" methods. PLAIN NONSENSE!"
2,Disappointing Read,"I purchased the book hoping it would provide real content about the rules and practices of Scrum. Instead, the author appears intent upon using the book to drive business to his Scrum certification business. He touts platitudes about ""the rules of Scrum"", but provides little substance. Outside of the basics -- that can be learned by simply searching for ""Scrum"" in a search engine -- the book offers little insight into how Scrum Masters conduct themselves differently than Project Managers. If you're looking for valuable insight into Scrum, skip this book. It was a waste of my money. One last gripe: The author wastes no opportunity to slam traditional Project Managers and projects run under the procedures of non-agile methodologies. Clearly, he has never worked for a good technical Project Manager on a well-run project. Contrary to his opinion, both do exist."
2,sales pitch not information,"This book is a sales pitch for agile project management, not a book on how to use it. There is chapter after chapter with the same format. 1) describe long list of problems company has, 2) implement agile 3) magic happens. There is a small amount of information on agile and how to use it."
3,"Good Overview, not very practical","I found this book to be an excellent introduction to the subject, however it was sparce on details and practical application. There were a lot of the author's experieces which I thought were useful dos and don'ts. I really expected more details on how to implement Scrum and was disappointed at the lack of real details."
4,"Concise, to the point and the reason that Agile exists...",Ken is one of the forefathers of Agile and is required reading for anyone thinking about embracing Agile software development. This book plus Kent Beck's book are the beginning of getting started working with the Agile methodology. Check out [...] for more information.Good luck implementing one of the best software development methodologies that have been embraced in the last 20 years.Ian BushAgile Scrum Consultant[...].[...].
4,A classic book of classic designs,"Clearly written and well illustrated. Contains every bit of info you'll need from start to finish including original sketches, materials lists, coloured charts, detailed instructions for the individual pieces and blocking, framing, matting, etc.. Flowers from A to Z in projects ranging from trinket box toppers to pillows and framed wall hangings in cross stitch, embroidery and crewel. Wonderfull designs."
2,"outdated, slow-paced material",This would be more appropriate for high school kids. The pacing is very slow. Grainy quality.
2,BLack fist is a somewhat enjoyable movie starrign Richard Lawson and a young Dabney Coleman,"You may rememeber Dabney Coleman from movies like Clifford, War Games, and There Goes the Neighborhood. He is the guy with that signature mustache and was always a great supporting actor. In fact he is working up to this very day. Coleman is what gives this movie feeling. he plays a cop who likes to gamble and have everything his way when it comes to these streetfights that he likes to watch. Richard Lawson shows up and wants to be a streetfighter to provide for his wife and child. He proves to be pretty tough so a gang hires him. Their are some actors who have trouble even spittign out their lines but the movie turns extremely dark at the end and actually kept me into it almost throughout the entire thing.You can get this flick in the Treeline 50 pack of martial arts movies and there are actually a bunch of fights at the start, so I certainly didn't mind that."
4,CORRECTIONS IN AMERICA,"I am not completely done with the text. I am about halfway through the book. Within this class, this book is truly worth reading. The chapters are only a few pages in length....the longest I found was about 8 pages long. The chapters read very easily and the information is never boring. A good book for a class."
4,Excellent overview of the business buying process,"This video takes you through the entire process of buying a video. The performance of the narrator is weak, but he serves well to re-attract your attention as a new topic is introduced. The interviews were very enlightening. Some of the production values were not great but the information is important and vital. I recommend it highly to anyone considering buying (or selling) a business."
5,exceptional activity book for little Caillou fans,"On a recent trip we bought quite a few sticker books for our toddler, and I thought this one was very good. Sixty stickers augment a variety of activities including matching, making patterns, coloring, sequencing, series completion, comparing, grouping, and a simple maze. Illustrations are very colorful and show Caillou in a wide variety of situations with Rosie and others from the television show familiar to kids. Notes to parents detail the skills involved on each page. Very nice activity book. We will definitely get more in this series for our next outing!"
1,Overdub piano playing,"This is an album where Bill Evans plays piano with overdubbing; the sound seems to be too annoying; I strongly prefer his trio albums - piano/drums/bass (in which I think the pianist reaches the highest levels).I can't help but giving this album 1 star, because, IMHU, this is not the real Bill Evans."
3,Not for everyone,This book assumes you have a dependable income. It also assumes you have already been putting money away. It gives no hope to those who run their own business and have not started saving.
3,Partly fictionalized,"Amazon's search-inside feature does not allow you to read the informative introduction by the historian Stephen L. Hardin, who says, ""Jennings himself admitted taking liberties."" This is unfortunate, since surely the book, which is supposed to be non-fictional autobiography, is not all fiction. It is just impossible for the non-specialist to know how much of the book is fiction and how much not."
1,Uncomfortable,"There's a bump right on the ball of my foot, and very little padding. I walk a lot at work and by the time I get home, my back hurts. I bought some insoles that made them a little better, but I think I'll still end up buying a different pair. Preferably something not made by Rockport."
5,best walking shoe ever,"Hmmmm! where do i start, back in 1989I was in a bad car accident, which messed up my ankle Ipurchased this shoe and it worked perfectlybecause i knew that my foot would never get better, and concernedthat the ""shoe"" might be discontinued, I purchased 10 pairs!!after 22 years I was down to my last pair (i am rough on shoes.expecting to pay 99.00 per pair I was delighted to only pay about60 here on amazon.Jim from pa THIS IS A GREAT SHOE!!!"
4,Shoes Too Narrow,These shoes were of good quality and the Amazon service was good. I normally wear a medium width shoe and this shoe in a Medium was too tight.A Wide would have probably worked OK.
2,quality sliding.....,"I've bought Rockport shoes for over 20 yrs...specifically the MWT 12W in dark brown...since my first pair, each successive pair has lacked in quality to a point where my most recent purchase was the last straw. My first pair, bought around 20 yrs ago, took several years to show wear and scuffs; normal wear and tear in my opinion. However, with each subsequent purchase the newer pairs scuffed much easier, revealing a lack of sufficient dye and workmanship. After this forth, and most recent purchase, I decided to write this review. Paying $60-80 for a pair of shoes should yield something of better quality."
2,Really Hurt My Feet,"I am always in search of comfortable walking shoes that I can also wear in the office. These looked like they may fit the bill. On arrival, they looked good - just like the photo. A bit more sneakery that I anticipated, but that was ok.I wore them to work that day and boy, they really hurt my feet. Mainly the toes on the outside and the ankle area. My activities included walking around a mall, driving, sitting at my desk, general walking around the office. By the time I got home I could barely walk. Very disappointing. Rockports are normally really good shoes and I have a pair that are pretty comfortable. Unfortunately, these did not do well for me at all.Black, Size 11 - M. There is a $6.95 restocking fee from the seller, but they agreed to take them back and refund all but that fee."
4,Good value for the price.,Not as comfortable as previous models of walking shoes by Rockport but overall still very good compared to other brands.
5,WALKING SHOES,"GREAT SHOES. They look good and feel good. I walk a lot and have sore feet, but these shoes keep my feet relatively comfortable. My next pair will definitely be Rockport."
5,Rockport Shoes,"Most comfortable, longest lasting shoes I have ever owned. Very good value. I don't wear anything else."
4,Value & comfort,I walk from the bus to the office each morning about 4 city blocks and 2.5 miles at lunch each day. I wanted a shoe that would be comfortable enough that I would not have to change into my ASICS Gels at lunch. These are that. Got mine for $65 including shipping. Only complaint is having to double knot them to keep them tied.
2,Disappointed,"Have used Rockport's for years. They use to be top of the line for comfort, yet look dressy enough to wear in the office. Comfort, quality, and value......but something changed. I bought a brown and black pair of this model. They are wearing faster than the older models and are NOT as comfortable. When you notice that you are wearing shoes that is usually a clue that something is not right. The old Rockports you could put on and walk in all day and never think about your shoes or your feet. Not so with this stiffer version. Sadly looks like when these wear out will have to try to find a more comfortable shoe."
4,comfortable shoes,"The shoes are fit very well, and very comfortable. However, If the seller respond more quickly and ship the shoes in time, it would be better."
5,"Comfortable, grippy, good looking","I have a narrow, hard-to-fit foot and wanted a reasonably priced walking shoe for city/street walking. What a find! These are probably the most comfortable shoes (after well-fitted runners) I have owned, the price was excellent, and the tread grip from damp/wet streets to polished office lobbies creates great confidence in the shoes. Not bad looking either. I will buy more pairs soon, just to ensure I have them as they naturally wear, age, and die."
1,Cheap,"Within days, the sole at the toe started de-laminating. Gluing back together was a pain and left a residue that does not look so good. For the level of quality in the overall construction, I would price these at $39.99. These are not made to last."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED - NOT FOR WALKING!,"These make a better race driving shoe than a walking shoe. Reason: race shoes have ultra-thin soles to enable sensitivity to car problems through the pedals, but walking over any pebbles is very unpleasant. I went by the great ♠reviews, but am terribly disappointed. The construction reminds me more of a slipper than a shoe, totally lacking in cushion to absorb shock and no lateral support. I would not recommend these to ANYONE."
5,Rockport Shoes,The rockport shoes that i purchased are the most comfortable shoes i have had. I will definitely make future purchases in the future. Totally satisfied with the product.
1,"Narrow toe box, dissimilar in size compared to other Rockport styles",I own several styles of Rockport shoes but returned these since the toe box was very narrow. Went to a Rockport store and bought 2 pairs of a different style. I don't know why the company wouldn't keep their sizing consistent amongst their various shoe styles.
3,OK,"While I always love Rockports, this time the fit was not as comfortable as usual. Perhaps my feet are getting wider. But the shoe is strong, well constructed."
4,almost the same as last pair,"My last pair of Rockport walking shoes lasted very well. I even had them partially re-soled. This pair is almost identical in appearance, but the leather seems thicker and they don't seem to breathe as well. They're probably tougher, but also noticeably warmer on the feet. This will be an issue when traveling in hot climates. Too bad they couldn't have stayed with the lighter leather for my taste. Otherwise a great, good looking shoe."
2,Dissapointing,"I have had these shoes for about a month now, and although the comfort has improved as they have been worn in, the insoles are still quite hard and uncomfortable. These shoes also cause _horrible_ odor and sweat problems for me that I do not experience with _any_ of my other shoes."
5,Awesome!!!,"These shoes are awesome! I use them for work, where I'm on my feet all day (9 hrs) and walk from 3-6 miles in them everyday. My feet don't hurt at all...I used to have Planter Facitis and now since I have been using them I don't have any problems....These shoes are also very well built, for I get a good year out them and with the mileage I put on them that's a big bang for the buck....They also fit true too size....Highly recommend"
3,Evolving disappointment with Rockport World Tour Classic,"I have been purchasing and wearing Rockport World Tour Classic walking shoes for many years and have put thousands of miles on them, but ever since they have been manufactured in Vietnam, there has been a definite change in the amount of material in the shoes -- specifically the mid-soles. The mid-soles are thinner and flimsy. This causes discomfort to my metatarsals after walking as little as a half hour. In the older versions of World Tour that I am still using, I can walk for up to two hours before this happens. I have now purchased three pair manufactured in Vietnam and it's the same story. Still a well made shoe but skimping on material."
2,not what they used to be,I have been a faithful purchaser of rocksport and more specifically the world tour model for as long as i can remember 15+ years. I purchased my last pair. It appears they must have changed the compound in the sole and or midsole and it is much stiffer. It reminds me of the days of old when leather soles were all that was available. The comfort factor has dropped way down and they no longer feel the same when wearing them. No bounce in your step. I switched to Dunham 8000 and they are much more comfortable. Shame on you rocksport. You had a great product but you should have paid closer attention to the details.
5,Most comfortable shoes,"I've had several pair of this exact shoe and find they are the most comfortable of any I have ever worn. After they are worn out for everyday use, I use them for lawn mowing or other work."
2,Its OK,"The shoe is light weight and fits well. Although it doesn't have a good arch support, unless you add an orthotic insert. It may be good for those who HAVE to wear formal-looking shoes at work. I can wear semi-formals at work, so prefer the black colored Asics GT-2150 over these. The Asics 2100 series are a masterclass of a shoe, no other shoe can rival the quality, fit and comfort. Period."
1,Not a Walking Shoe -- Uncomfortable,"I've worn Rockport for years hiking, working and leisure all with the same shoe and consistently had the shoes last well over a year, even after day to day use. The previous shoe style I would buy, a similar nubuck style, was discontinued. So, I gave this shoe a try expecting similar performance. That didn't happen. The World Tour shoe appears to be as well made as any other Rockport I've owned but after one week of wearing the shoe, I'm considering returning it to Amazon as defective. First, the inner soles are not uniform. The lack of uniformity wasn't enough for me to send them back, so I worn them for about a week. These aren't walking shoes. These are cheap ""knock-off"" walking shoes. No other shoe or boot I own causes this amount of discomfort."
2,Kind of disappointed,"I ordered these last Saturday and got them on Monday. Amazon Prime is great!I bought the shoes after reading so many favorable reviews. Most people say these are very comfortable shoes. I got the brown ones. The leather is real stiff. After wearing them for two consecutive days they still do not feel comfortable. They pinch the top of my feet, especially when I walk down the stairs. I will wear them for 2 more days to see if they will break in. Wonder if Amazon will take them back after that if things don't work out."
3,Shipping Slow.......,Purchased this product for my son-he buys these every six months and walks alot in his job so these shoes are very great shoes for walkers. The price was similar to other places so the price is alright but the shipping was almost 3 weeks for them to arrive. If you want to get them in a day-maybe two at the most for the same price get your shoes at Zappos. They will always upgrade your shipping for any purchase and you will get it almost overnight. At the same price!
2,Not the old Rockport,"I remember 30 years ago when I was on my feet for hours on end..I was turned on to Rockports by a friend who said they were the softest shoe around. I bought them and yes, they were.Now, I need them again. I went looking for Rockports. The reviews were wonderful! I just wonder how many are rockport employees. I paid about 75 bucks for a shoe that could be had for 45 in most places...But what the hey! It will be comfortable! WRONG! Sure, they fit well. They are homely though..and the legendary soft sole was gone, replaced with just your typical hard sole you find in most shoes...Okay for 45 bucks but not acceptable at 75. I am returning them.Looks,,geekyFit very goodComfort...ordinary...Value. not enough."
4,Best shoes for casual wear,"Love these shoes, very comfortable on my feet, last about a year of wearing daily to work. I am a big guy (6'5"", 350 lbs) and require very comfortable shoes or my feet are killing me by the end of the day. These shoes are perfect for me. The leather does seem to be wearing abnormally fast on the back of my left shoe, on either side of the heel, but I think it's from when i roll to and away from my desk and one of the wheels of my chair rubs the side of my foot. This doesn't affect the comfort of the shoe though, so it doesn't really bother me. If not for that I'd give it a 5 star."
5,Great shoes,"Great shoes, They look great and are well built. Cummfy and they go well with anything. I love rockport shoes and have about 4 pair now and continue to keep buying more of them"
3,It's a basic shoe.,"This is a very light, basic shoe. Seems to run long. There is not a lot of arch support in this shoe."
4,Not quite as good as I expected,"They are very good quality construction. They provide good support. The shoe fits well.They are Superior in comfort to my ""dress shoes"" but not quite what I had expected from a ""walking shoe"". After upgrading the inserts, it became a very comfortable shoe but still did not offer the shock absorption expected. I would buy them again but my expectations are changed."
5,Excellent value!,"My husband has been wearing this particular style of Rockport for almost 20 years. His last pair actually had the sides split and the soles coming off. What a great surprise when he got his new ""favotite"" shoes for Christmas. The quality is the same and the best price anywhere. I highly recommend this item to anyone. The service is good and the shipping time excellent. Thanks AMAZON!from the redneck capital of the world."
5,"Great quality, comfortable and reasonable price","This is my fisrt time to order shoes through internet (or mail order). I have been wearing them to work for the past two weeks, and they are great. I was surprised that there was no discomfort at all from day one."
1,This shoe is terrible,"I purchased this same pair last year, and they were very comfortable. The pair I just purchased is not made with the same material. The shoe is very stiff and the sole is rock hard, as compared to the same shoe I bought last year. It is a very bad shoe to buy......"
1,Rockport improve your quality control!!,"Over 30 years of buying shoes of various brands this was my first ROCKPORT pair. The shoes are very comfortable, however within two weeks of wearing the shoes one of shoe the lace started fraying. Reason was that one of the eyelet was not set in properly and has a sharp edge that kept cutting on the shoe lace. My first pair ever with a defect and it was a ROCKPORT shoe.Rockport needs to implement their quality control if they want to keep the brand up. Thanks to AMAZON's return policy. Defective one is out and new one without defect is in. AMAZON took care of shipping both ways. I happened to call ROCKPORT customer service about the defect and their response was,""send the shoes with prepaid shipping and then the ROCKPORT will provide replacement shoes if the technician determine that the shoes may be considered defective."" I had better expectation from ROCKPORT."
5,Great shoe,"I've loved this model of shoe for a long time. Every time I wear them out, I replace them with the latest version. I can wear them for anything but the dressiest occasion, and they are very comfortable to walk in."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I bought this for my working shoe which I have to stand for long hour. The build quality is nice and strong but It has a very hard sol. It makes my foot bruise after couple days, lucky I bought 1/2 size bigger so I can put extra cushion.I won't buy this type of Rockport next time."
3,Not bad but not the best,"It probably depends on the shape of your foot but I find the shoes too narrow at the toes rendering too tight a fit. Also, although durable, the soles are a bit slippery on wet surfaces."
2,What happened?,"I had a pair of Rockports that looked almost identical to these shoes and they were VERY nice shoes. I just bought a pair of these online, and they aren't nearly as comfortable as the first pair I had. The padding around the sides seems thinner and the material seems rougher. They rub on the sides of my feet and hurt. I would not buy these if I had tried them on first. I think I'll stick to going to the store from now on to buy shoes."
5,great investment,"Have worn Rockports for years - the old Pro Walker - tried this new World Tour Classic - great shoe. Takes a while to get it to comform to the foot, but once that takes place - feels like a glove. Highly recommended."
4,2nd set,Great shoe. I wore the tread out on my first set. Came back for another pair. Feels like I'm wearing a pair of sneakers but with a little style.
5,"Very comfortable; they are called ""walking shoes"" for a good reason!","I walk a great deal, both for my job and for relaxation after work. These are the most comforable pair of Rockports I've ever purchased. They look great...and, better yet, your feet will love 'em!"
3,This Classic not like the Old Classic,"I must agree with reviewer Puglisi about these shoes. I've owned several pairs of Rockport World Tour Classics in the past. While these look the same, they don't feel the same. In these, the removable EVA footbed is quite thin and the surface underneath is hard and flat. With my old World Tour Classics, the surface underneath the removable footbed was springy, and the shoe felt amazingly comfortable even when first worn. Although these aren't bad right out of the box, there is a noticeable difference. On the plus side, these were available at a Friday Sale price that was downright cheap."
2,eyelits are bad,"These shoes are fantastic, I work on concrete and the shoe stands up very well, however, the eyelits on this particular pair are not allowing the strings to be pulled without damage to the lace itself. In the years that I plan on wearing these I will probably go through 10 or more pairs of strings! This particular lace pulls apart when it becomes blemished!!!Amazon needs to send out extra shoe laces if this is the type of product it is selling(seconds???)."
2,Overrated Shoe,"This was my first purchase of a Rockport shoe and I expected a lot more due to all of the glowing reviews of this model. I ordered a 12M and the shoes were the correct size, but the tongue on the left shoe dug into my ankle bone while walking (others have mentioned this issue as well). I wore them an entire day at my office job to see if I could get over it, but a shoe shouldn't be this uncomfortable during break-in. The stock insoles feel thin and unsupportive as well. The support improved when I put in some aftermarket insoles from my old shoes, but they still chew on my ankle. The overall stitching, leather, and build quality look good but that doesn't make up for discomfort. Some people have mentioned the World Tour's sold by Amazon are Grade ""B"" shoes...I'll have to test that theory if I find a retail store that stocks them. Unfortunately I've only seen the ""Eureka"" model in stores. Returning this set for a refund."
5,Fine shoe,Bought 2 pairs to help my feet after a fall that fractured both heel bones. Lots of support for my poor feet.
4,"buen zapato, construido con cuero excelente","quien lo compre deberá antes, definir el ancho requerido. a mi me resulto algo estrecho, al no considerar lo recomendado"
1,"For my surprise, If was for a gift, when the receiver opened the box we saw a pair of used shoes .","For my surprise, If was for a gift, when the receiver opened the box we saw a pair of used shoes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Worst experience ever.Rockport Men's World Tour Classic Walking Shoe,Black,7.5 W US"
3,Really disapointed,"Just a shoe, for all the ratings and hoopla and price. I expected more.They really look good. They don't feel bad. I just thought they would provide more cushion and support like a sneaker."
1,Rockport Walker,"I have been wearing Rockport shoes almost exclusively for about the last 25 years. I have very hard feet to fit and Rockport are the onlydress-up shoes that do fit me. I bought a pair of Rockport shoes with this sole after wearing the Vibram brand but these rubber soles were so hard and unforgiving they ""killed"" my feet. I could not break them in and eventually returned them for a refund. It was unfortunate and disappointing as I liked the style."
2,Not Your World Tour Classic,i agree with some of the reviews that this revision of the world tour classic makes it stiffer. why the changes rockport?
2,My fourth pair of Rockports.,"I have ordered all my Rockports online, simply because I knew my size and had tried them on in a shoe store in the past. Buying a new pair of shoes was a ""no brainer"" for me. Except this time. The shoes I ordered were an 11 extra wide, as in 4E size. I usually buy from Zappos directly but this time I chose Amazon instead, because I thought they were doind business together already. Not so. The shoes I received were marked as XW, which is how they are always marked when I buy them. This pair feels a lot narrower than XW. My toes are uncomfortable in this pair simply because I don't believe they are extra wide. For me to return them woulde be a royal pain, so I shall live with what I have until I need a new pair Other than that I really enjoy shopping at Amazon."
4,Very comfortable and well constructed,"I've purchased over a dozen pair of these shoes over the past decade. The fit very comfortably and are well constructed. I have always purchased the model MWT18. Rockport offers several models called ""World Tour"" and they are not all alike. These have a nice pebble finish. I believe the inferior models others found were not the MWT18. Many years ago, they came out with the World Tour 2000, which was far inferior. At that time, Macy's discontinued carrying the MWT18. My only complaint about these shoes is that they perform poorly on wet surfaces. Their light-weight Vibram(tm) sole doesn't grip to wet surfaces."
5,Look up quality in the dictionary and it will read....see Rockport Shoes.,Most comfortable and best quality shoe in all my 55 years. Well worth the price. Have since purchased a second pair.
3,It's okay say it,I like them ok. I read a review where it says it needs a little time to break them in and this seems to hold true. If Rockport would have used a better insole it might have made a difference.
5,Nice Shoes,I love they way they fit and feel. Rockport makes a great quilty shoe.I would buy these shoes again. Thanks Rockport.
4,shoes,Shoes were received quicker than expected but packaging was less than desireable since one pair of the shoes were loose inside the outter packaging
2,Not a good fit,Same shoe bought 2 years ago for my husband and the fit was better than any shoe ever. This shoe rubbed the inner ankle area and was returned. Was surprised and disappointed.
5,I love my Rockports,"I have been wearing rockports for at least 15 years now and have not been able to fault them. Comfortable from the first time you wear them and long lasting. This style here I use them for my job and I am on my feet most of my shift, any other brand or style of shoe and I would be looking for the nearest chair to get of my feet. Worth every cent in my opinion and will continue to buy Rockports as long as they keep up the quality."
4,no looking back,"20 years ago a friend of mine who owned a shoe store suggested I try Rockport shoes; at the time they were way over my budget but I was sick of sore feet and shoes that didn't last so I cringed and paid the bill. I have never looked back or at another shoe since, it is the only non athletic shoe I buy now and it has never disappointed me yet. Pricey yes but it lasts twice as long and is way more comfortable."
3,"Great shoe, very comfotable. Do not rely on shoe size for a good fit. I always wear 9.5 D shoes","Do not rely on stated shoe size. Never wore any shoe size but 9.5D. These were at least a half size too large. Should have sent them back, but needed them now. I need to wear two pair of heavy socks for them to be comfortable. Otherwise shoes are great. very good product, just not the size I expected. If you orderthese take this into consideration. First purchase from Amazon that was not great."
5,great shoe,"I bought these to replace my 15 year old pair of prowalkers. The new pair are just as good as the old ones, feel good from the getgo and look sharp. An excellent value."
2,Sole Separation,"Unfortunately I cannot give this shoe 5 stars. This is my first pair and granted they are comfortable however, in a little less than 7 months the outer sole on the left shoe has separated. Not sure if anyone else has had this problem but for a $90.00 shoe one would think this type of ""wardrobe malfunction"" would not occur."
5,Comfortable Shoe,"I've been wearing these Rockport shoes for at least 8 years - They feel great from the start. I no longer have foot discomfort. My back & hip-joint pain goes away until the heals start to wear down. Each pair last me 9-12 months. When my back starts to ache, it's time for new shoes. I've never worn out uppers or had sole separation.The only problem I have with the shoe is finding them in black 8EE or 8EEE. When I do find them I buy at least 3 pair. This is the first time I've looked on line and still no luck."
5,Rockport World Tour,"Great shoes. Great price. No ""breaking in"" required.These were purchased as a gift as a replacement for a pair purchased 5 years ago and worn almost everyday.The black tumbled color also does not need polishing on a regular basis. Overall a wonderful shoe."
5,Great shoes,Great shoes! I can't find my feet size in the local Mall everywhere but I can find them here at Amazon. Great price too. Will buy again.
5,Superb selection for the holidays,"I have owned this recording as a cassette for years, only last year finally picking it up as a CD when I played the cassette to death. I really enjoy this recording, and something I recommend highly for anyone who loves Christmas music that is not from the pop scene. Snatch a copy up while their available...wish they would re-release this one."
5,SUPER,This is a great watch cap. It's just like the one I had in the U.S. Navy from 1952-1956. I purchased 2 and they more than met my expectations. Thanks.
5,This cap is awesome for cold weather,"Unlike cheapo caps, you can't wear this one indoors long. It is very warm, and clearly made of good quality wool. It doesn't itch even a bit, yet it is so warm. It is also warm even when it is wet from snow shoveling. I lost my first one, and so had to buy another one."
4,Sensational!,"This book was actually assigned reading for a modern Spanish literature class I took in college; I liked it so much I have re-read it twice since. The story alternates between two narratives of the protagonist Lucia: the memoir Lucia is writing about the week before the premiere of the first movie she directed, and the journal she is writing 30 years later as she lies in the hospital with an undiagnosed illness. The way it is written, however, both narratives feel like present day stories. Montero's conversational writing style makes her very easy to read, even with the switches in narrative and with Lucia's philosophical commentaries on love, relationships, and death. It is both entertaining and mildly thought-provoking. Enjoy!"
3,Thoughtful fusions,"3 1/2Although short of the visionary work perhaps intended, this still remains highly diversified and personal trio jazz worth learning."
3,Funky acid jazz,I have a tape of this album a friend made for me in '93 and I have worn it out so I need to upgrade to the cd. This album is loaded with tenor and baratone sax. If you like tripped-out jazz with a slightly funky beat then you will enjoy this cd.
2,Good if you don't need to travel...,"The Pocketec HD does as advertised and works well-- if you don't need to travel. I've had my hard drive for about 6 months and it has completely stopped working. When it was work, I had good transfer speeds (USB 2.0) and it was USB powered, which is why I had gotten rid of my old portable hard drive. This one might have been okay if I kept it in a case that provided more cushion than what comes with the unit, but I'll never know now. So if you just need a stationary portable HD (maybe to transfer between different systems in your home or office), then this is probably perfect. If, like me, you are on the road at least 1-2 weeks a month, you'll want a more robust hard drive that won't crash on you."
5,hanas suitcase,i read this book in secod grade because i enjoy the holocaust and have a hgh reading level.i pestered my 3 friends to read it. finally a couple months ago in fourth grade.to this day it is our favorite bbook. ps i read 4 books a week
5,Hana's Suitcase,"I've read many accounts of the holocaust throughout my 68 years ...and thought, perhaps,this particular story might be a good introduction to this time in history for my granddaughter. I read it, prior to giving it to her. It was captivating. She read the book and decided to present the story in her class for her spoken book report. Her teacher borrowed the book and now this little volume has been added the list their 'new' list of required reading for the 3rd grade class. The accompanying photographs, needless to say are precious and in themselves, tell a story."
4,Hana's Suitcase,"This was a wonderful book. Hana's Suitcase allowed children to connect the events of the Holocaust with the experiences of a person about their own age who actually was affected by these events. Although sad by definition, the tale ends on a high note, as Hana's older brother travels to Japan to meet with young visitors at a Holocaust Museum. He is able to tell of his young sister who actually carried the suitcase in one of the museum's exibits and who later died while imprisoned by the Nazis."
5,Hanna's Suitcase,This book is AMAZING!!!!!!It tells you so much about the history and how people lived back then that I actully felt like I was actully in the book.In some of the parts it is so emotional that it made me cry.Some of my favorite parts in the book is when her friends that she makes in the book offer to bring word from what has happened to her brother and when the guard offered her free meal tickets.I tell you people like that will get far in life.
4,"Pacific, Gas & Electric Lives on!","This solid rock band fronted by the talented Charlie Allen were passed over and forgotten in the plethora of rock groups in the late 60's/early 70's. With former Canned Heat drummer Frank Cook and guitarist Glenn Schwartz, they worked the club scene and played solid rock. Although this is a great album, their first album, Get It On, needs to be re-issued as it contains their by far best work. Best song, Are You Ready, with background vocals by the Blueberries. At this price, you can't pass up this record."
3,"Reissue ""Get It On"" ! !","I totally agree with Kent. This CD is OK, but come one, where is ""Wade In The Water""?????This band played Fillmore West many times, and I was lucky to catch them.It's the mark of a band to have people clamoring for an old LP.It's the record company that didn't help them in the first place that we have to appeal to now?"
2,missing song,why is the song Thank God for you baby missing it was on the original album in 1969--I bought this cd for that one song and now im very disappointed that its not on there-4-3-07-tues eve. and it showed a 15 track selection but it did say it contained all 7 of the original songs but listed 15 songs on the cd--whats up with this i was decieved--was it Columbia's fault or what.
4,So-So mold for a fabulous mare.,"The mold doesn't do Wixom justice- the pose is odd, and the hindquarter is not sculptured correctly. Nor does it do justice to the quality of her movement, which is truly outstanding. The vertical balance is not quite right either, she stands up on more leg than the model would lead you to beleive. Her front end is well done, though; very elegant and characteristic of the breed and the Robinson bloodlines. Persons wishing to see a more accurate model of a show-type draft horse would do well to review a Peter Stone model, especially the one of MG's Prince."
4,CUTE,SHE HAS A FUNNY TOY LIKE TAIL.BUT HAS A BEAUITFUL BLACK COAT.JUST LIKE SPIRIT MY DAUGHTERS BLACK WILD MUSTANG.BUT HER HORSE IS A LOT BIGGER HAS A LONGER TAIL AND MANE AND SPIRIT IS A YOUNG STALLION.ALL MY 789 HORSES LOOK BETTER
2,"Durable, but towards a scary Breyer trend of...","..fodder. They take unknown horses, make an inaccurate model of it, slap it on a shelf with a high price. Durable, but crudely sculpted and w\o tone. Also in this scary trend of cheesy ""lookalikes"" are Secretariat, a lesson pony, and dressage horses. They all look like regular horses with names slapped on them. The exceptions are the Seabiscuit and movie-based horses. P.S.--fix the ADULT FORM! I'm 15 and it doesn't work."
3,Excuse me............,"Ok, this is for the other reviewers........ RuPaul is NOT a TRANSVESTITE!!! RuPaul is considered a ""Performing Drag-Queen"".There is a BIG difference between transvestite and drag queen.........If your going to write a review --- GET THE FACTOIDS STR8!!!!!The doll is great!!!"
5,RUPAUL DOLL---ITS ABOUT TIME!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS IS THE TOY COMANY TO BUY FASHION DOLLS FROM.I HAVE ALL OF JASON WU DOLLS. THEY PUT MATTEL BARBIE TO SHAME. PLUS THEY TAKE CHANCES . THE WORLD IS NOT WHAT IT USE TO BE.AND MY HATS OFF TO INTEGRITY TOYS FOR GETTING A GREAT ARTIST TO BRING THE FASHION DOLL TO THE 21TH CENTREY.

AND JASON WU IS A GREAT ARTIST. BUY THIS DOLL PEOPLE!THERES TO MUCH HATEING IN THE WORLD!BRAVO! TOYRUS"
1,WHAT???,"THIS DOLL IS SHOWING OFF HER BREASTS EVEN IN THE BOX! Mothers, don't lt your child get her. And why would you want to buy a doll like this? I suggest that you buy ANOTHER Barbie."
4,Maybe have color choice option?,"The cups are very good and I bought them online because it's difficult to find them in stores. Out of all choices I had a 1/4 chance of getting VERY girly colors and I did. I received a pink and purple one for my boy. Perhaps it would make sense to actually have an option for customers to choose their own colors? I don't see how it would make the seller's life more difficult, but it would certainly make a customer's life less difficult:-) Unfortunately I will not order other ""colors may vary"" merchandise on Amazon until then."
1,"Terrible - it leaks and ""colors may vary"" is an understatement","As the title says - it leaks. And it leaks all the time. As well, I bought these for my 3-year old girl and the cups came with patterns for boys (e.g. race cars). Luckily, it only bothered my wife and not my daughter, however, if this is important to you, beware!"
3,Unsure if my son will get boy colors,I am writing this in the hopes that my special needs little boy will receive cups that are meant for a boy. If they are not then I feel that I will return them and continue with this review and turn it extremely bad. I am writing this early in the hopes that the seller will read it and send him the proper cups...if he gets the right cups I will then change this to a very very positive review. please have choices for parents of special needs children as well as for all children.
1,Rich Man Poor Man be careful,"I was so happy to surprise my husband with one of his favorite mini series that we have not been able to find. It took a very long time to get here, and on x-mass morning when he wanted to watch it we found out that we did not have the right dvd player for the region, I guess it only plays in England. We never knew there were regions and everyone I asked also knew nothing about it. The co. pretty much said we we shiot out of luck and to buy a new dvd player they had some, need less to say I did not purchase anything else from them.. They should of explained things better we still have not been able to watch Rich Man Poor Man."
5,The live show to get,"Not a noise concert like live in Brixton, this has actual songs and they're great. More energy than in the studio. If you like ATR, buy this."
1,Dark,It was the shortest version I've seen. The classic scenes like time between artful dodger and Oliver in the orphanage. What happened to that wonderful movie. This movie was dark and evil. I was so very disappointed
5,Excellent!,Items received in the time I was told and are in excellent condition. Would buy from this seller again!
4,Academy Award winner of 1969,I first saw this movie in 1972 in school. The magic is still there. I love the music and choreography et al. This movie is a gem.
4,Love this musical,"I bought this Oliver musical combo because my kids and I were rehearsing for the musical. The sound track does not cover all the key songs (1 I was suppose to sing), which was a bummer (Bill Sikes - Strong Men...). Other than that it was a good investment in a classic."
5,Oliver Sparkles!,"Good Old-fashioned homemade hot chocolate pudding is what OLIVER! is. Ron Moody, not Jack Wild, steals the show with funny songs like ""Pick a Pocket or Two"" and ""Reviewing the Situation."" All the songs are accompanied by epic-sized production. This is wonderful wholesome fun. Please check it out. You will not be disappointed."
4,"Even if you don't like Charles Dickens, you'll love Oliver!!","In the many times I've seen this movie musical it hasn't once bored me.The unforgettable Ron Moody (what ever happened to him?) sets a very lovable character. The stars of this movie however are Jack Wild as the Artful Dodger and Shani Wallis (where did she go?) as Nancy. I still get goosebumps when I hear her version of ""As long as he needs me""! Mark Lester as Oliver was a wrong choice for me, unfortunately. The movie captures a very interesting period in history. Carol Reed and Lionel Bart both did a great job! Highly recommended for everyone between 6 and 100 years! Buy it!"
2,PITIFUL 5.1 sound,"I purchased this DVD in the hope of re-living the magic from my childhood! I am not a technical expert, but the sound quality for both the dialogue and especially the music (5.1 dolby digital) was so bad that I am going to return this and wait for an updated version. This movie won Oscars for sound and music back then, and they totally blew it on this one."
5,Jack Wild,"Lovers of this glorious film might want to know that Jack Wild (""lummy Jack - the Dodger - the Artful Dodger"") died of mouth cancer on 1st March 2006. He was 53. From what I've found about him on the Internet, he seems to have been an adorable man - good-natured, reckless, finally unlucky. When he made this film he was 15, six years older than Mark Lester (Oliver), but so short that he had to wear stacked shoes. He stayed friends with Lester and Ron Moody (Fagin) till the end.Morrissey's dismal song ""Little Man, What Now?"" was apparently inspired by Wild's broken career, which if true reveals Morrissey as a chilly little creep but is no worthy memorial to its subject.""'Ow green can you get?"" demands the Dodger on first meeting the innocent Oliver. Evergreen, Jack; evergreen."
3,"Oscar winning movie, DVD production lacking.","Why would the DVD company buy rights to an Oscar winnning movie, only to put it on 2 seperate sides of a single disc? Who knows, and frankly who cares. Hopefully a better company will remaster this DVD someday so I do not have to flip over the DVD after 90 minutes of a classic film. For this reason alone, I still watch my VHS copy of this because you do not need to break the continuity of the movie while you're watching it."
3,A musical for the die-hard fan.,"I remembered this movie fondly from when I was a kid. Looking at it now, I'm awfully glad I enjoyed it then. Now it seems awfully forced. I dare any adult to get through the numerous production numbers without chuckling. But for kids (I suspect very young kids) this may be a completely different experience. With songs like ""Consider Yourself"" and ""Food, Glorious Food"" it's hard to deny a certain hum-ability. And there's the classic victim diva anthem ""As Long As He Needs Me"". The presentation is first rate, with a widescreen (only) transfer and a good ""making of"" documentary. END"
3,missing half the movie,"receive my iteam as ordered,however, when i watched it it was missing half the movie.i saw the movie several times in 1968 so i know when it is to start when oliver is at the orphanage and it goes to how he got to his uncle's. that part is missing, movie i have starts when he is at his uncle.missing how he got there. please replace the movie with it entire story."
5,I love this musical,"This is definitly the best musical I have EVER seen. Sometimes you can tell with the older films that they were made a while ago, but Oliver! isn't one of them. As soon as the music starts, you are captivated and riveted to your seat. Awesome performance by Shani Wallis, Jack Wild and Ron Moody. I personally think that Oliver Reed could've done a better job. Mark Lester was a little too young to do a good acting job, but he was so cute and had the perfect look for Oliver. The choreography in this film makes me shake my head every time. Onna White really did a fantastic job on it. My favorite songs are ""Consider Youself"", ""I'd do Anything"", ""Pick a Pocket"", and ""Oom Pah Pah"". All of the songs were brilliant. The words, the music...I could go on and on all day.WATCH THIS MUSICAL!"
5,Masterpiece!,"According to Wikipedia, ""Masterpiece (or chef d'aeuvre) in modern usage refers to a creation that has been given much critical praise, especially one that is considered the greatest work of a person's career or to a work of outstanding creativity, skill or workmanship"". Watching ""Oliver!"" I can't help thinking that this musical is a true masterpiece."
5,Wonderful retelling of the Dickens classic,"This movie definitely has a considerably happier note than the book. In the book, there were quite a few bits of nitty-gritty writing about the poverty in Industrial Revolution England and the conditions of those unfortunate enough to not have a home or three healthy, decent square meals a day just because their parents died or were unable to take care of them.There's lots of singing, but it's a good movie. Some of the musical and dance numbers really are fun to watch, though this might not be a movie for everybody, especially those who are very strict about movies being faithful to the books. But I found this a satisfying version of the book and more appropriate for a movie format, especially with certain scenes like Oliver asking for more food and Mr. Bumble flipping his lid over this."
5,oliver,"this dvd of oliver,the musical, cost $20.00 anywhere else, i paid much less with amazon! fast shipment too."
5,One of the two greatest Dickens films,Forget all that overrated David Lean posturing. This film is the second greatest film version of a Dickens novel - ever. The best is George Cukor's DAVID COPPERFIELD (1935).
1,"Oliver DVD, 1969","The DVD that was sent was in Italian, it was ordered on November 11, 2011 and arrived January 7, 2012. The DVD will NOT play in my DVD player in the USA. The message states that the DVD is ""incompatible in this region."""
5,I love musicals!,I loved this musical when I first saw it way back in 1969! I was just a teenager then. I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my 9 year old nephew. Don't know if he has watched it yet or not.
5,Consider it a wonderful experience,"The movie musical was on its way out by the time 'Oliver!' hit theaters in 1968. Happily, this marvelously fun and entertaining film swept the Oscars and earns my vote for the best musical of the 60s (although 'The Music Man' ranks a close second). Mark Lester is adorable in the title role and Jack Wild is a kick as the mischievious Artful Dodger. Then there's Ron Moody recreating his stage role as the villainous (but still likable) Fagin. He's not exactly the same character created by Charles Dickens but he's memorable just the same. And Shani Wallis' Nancy along with Oliver Reed's Bill Sikes give the film some real dramatic punch. The production design strikingly recreates the feel and flavor of mid-19th century London. And the songs which include 'Consider Yourself' and 'Oom Pah Pah' are the icing on the cake. Do your family a great favor and add this timeless treat to your DVD collection."
3,"Great Movie, but..........","Don't get me wrong, Oliver is a fabulous musical. A great adaptation of Charles Dickens classic. My 3 stars for this is because the DVD could have been so much better. First of all this is advertised as the 30th Anniversary edition. Well where are the extras? An Oliver reunion, or making of commentary with the stars would have been such a great addition. My understanding is all of the leads are still alive and breathing. Why didn't you get them for this? Also....BIG complaint.....If Titanic, which is over 3 hours long, can be put on one side of a DVD then WHY did this movie have to be put on two sides? When watching a movie I do not want to have to get up, eject the DVD, turn it over and start part two. That should have gone out with Laserdiscs. VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Alll in all , a great movie. Hopefully for the 40th Anniversary the studio will re-release this THE RIGHT WAY!"
3,"Reed succeeds, but Lean triumphs!","With lavish sets, tasteful color, hummable tunes, and two well-cast parts (Moody and Wild), this can hardly fail to be a pleasant slice of solid entertainment. But to the viewer from Ft. Lauderdale and all cinema buffs out there, I cannot stress enough that maestro David Lean's 1948 filming of ""Oliver Twist"" is the one to see! (See my review--and Amazon's--for the Criterion DVD edition.) For all that ""Oliver!"" provides in the above categories, ""Oliver Twist"" blows out of sight. Acting, script, music, everything truly represents cinema at it's utmost brilliant! For you visual connoisseurs, the spellbinding photography and art direction is the greatest ever crafted (you Welles and Kubrick fans which is an ordinary series of shots in Reed's ""Oliver!"", becomes the most brilliant five minutes in film history in Lean's ""Oliver Twist!"" P.P.S. Just to prove that I'm not an easy audience, check out my review for ""Citizen Kane!"""
2,Disappointed Looks like a bootleg,"I always loved the movie Oliver. I was hoping to introduce this to my grandchildrenWhat I received was a plastic box- no paperwork inside- no programs- just a box and unmarked disc of the dvd- no artwork on the dvd- looks like copy of something-I was so disappointed- we couldnt find out tracks, who performed, no info at all inside the box- unlike any other dvd I ever ordered from Amazon."
1,I thought I was ordering DVDS,I thought I was ordering DVDS so very disappointed.I'm not sure how this happened but we don't have a working video player so won't be able to use these.
2,A puffed-up mess whose original message is lost in an intellectual misfire,"SPOILERS FOLLOWI need to be a dissenting voice and say that this movie is not as good as it wants its audience to believe it is. The only things that recommend it are an admittedly grandiose portrayal of Fagin by Ron Moody that justly rivals Alec Guinness in the overall better ""Oliver Twist,"" and a couple of songs that rise above the mediocrity of their counterparts. ""Food, Glorious Food"" and ""Consider Yourself"" are not reason enough to make the rest of the musical. Performances are shoddy and unremarkable. Bill Sikes is a dandy bore in this production and not the monster Dickens wrote him to be. Worst of all, Dickens' message of nobility amidst poverty is completely lost in the desire to mutate the story into a happy-go-lucky song-and-dance. Stay away at all costs."
3,A dissenting opinion.,"I not a big fan of this movie, and everytime I see it I am left wondering how did this overlong, over-indulgent musical win Best Picture. I just don't get it. I can understand ""The Sound of Music"" and ""My Fair Lady"" winning; but ""Oliver!""?I think what annoys me the most about this film are those huge, big budget, musical production numbers that just seem to be in the movie simply for the sake of having them. They do nothing for developing the plot or the characters.(""Who Will Buy"" is a perfect example.) Frankly, I find them a big bore and they really make this movie drag. It is way too long already with the main characters breaking into a song and dance routine every five minutes or so.I do enjoy the timeless Dicken's story, some of the songs (The rapper Jay-Z recently sampled from ""I'll Do Anything), and the performances of Jack Wild and the late Oliver Reed. Yet, I am still confused as to how this movie won Best Picture."
2,that little oliver is a brat,not the character i mean the kid who plays him is a brat..i hate him he cant sing and is very annoying and ruined the movie for me
1,Oliver,"I cannot review this product as I have not yet received it. It is now 9 days overdue, and I paid for it over amonth ago."
4,A fun musical the whole family can enjoy.,"The musical Oliver is based on the famous novel Oliver Twist. Although this version of the story cannot be compared to the original due to its more comic nature, this is a much more palatable version for children to start with. Oliver has several memorable songs including ""I'd Do Anything For You"" and ""You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two."" I would definitely recommend this movie to people who enjoy other musicals such as ""The Sound of Music"" or ""My Fair Lady."" However, it has a slightly darker tone to it that has kept it from ever becoming an endearing favorite among musicals."
1,VERY DISAPOINTED customer,"I ordered this DVD in April, but should have viewed it before the 30 days limit to return it expired. When I did finally open this DVD, I found that it didn't contain the whole movie!! Plus the disc was scratched causing the movie to freeze. This is not my first disapointment with movies from Amazon, but be assured, it is my last! I wont be ordering again! I'd rather pay more and know I'm getting what I paid for!"
1,Incomplete movie,"The first half of the movie was missing. It started off with Oliver singing ""Who will buy"". How disappointing. I stopped watching after 5 minutes."
3,Very Very Long songs,"I did not care for this movie. It was a nice plot, but many songs were long, some unbearably so. It was a long wait to see what would happen next.I would not recommend this movie for kids, unless you want a movie that gets them bored. I wish I hadn't spent my money on this. At least the library will get a book / movie sale donation out of it."
2,"Very poor audio, considering Dolby 5.1",The case says that the soundtrack is re-recorded in Dolby 5.1 Digital. Don't be fooled. All the songs are in stereo only. There is no surround sound at all except for two crowd scenes. Big deal. Dont waste your money.
3,consider it a good movie,this was a pretty good musical version of oliver twist mark lester was great. I espically like jack wild and ron moody as dodger and fagin after seeing this you bound to be hum the songs all night. if you have to read the novel for a class and want to cheat by wacthing a movie dont use this version.
3,Reviewing the situation.,"Attractive musical score, but I think I enjoyed the character of Fagan most of all, particularly his performance of the song ""I'm Reviewing The Situation."" It was cleverly written and evoked several laughs. Everyone who likes musicals should find this enjoyable, although it lacks the comfortable humor of My Fair Lady and the development of emotional depth found in Fiddler on the Roof."
5,Music teacher showed this to class and they love it!,Definitely support the arts in schools! The music teacher has exposed the kids to things that they would never have the opportunity to see. Peaks their interest and inspires them to continue in the arts!
4,like the Proust's Madeleine.,"a wonderful moment, full of souvenirs still up to date musically, technically speaking. A nice way to re-discover one of the greatest musicals ever done in the sixties ! Mark Lester is superb, all the actors are wonderful"
4,Love the songs!,"I like this movie, my favorite thing about it is the songs. I wish I could find the soundtrack for it!:-)"
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I bought this book for my daughter to use.She needed help with her writing and I thought this would be the perfect tool for her to use.By writing to celebrities and getting their autographs,I thought it would keep her motivated. So far,of the three she has written she has had two returned in the mail for the wrong address.What a waste of my hard earned money.You would be wiser to save your money and surf the web to find the addresses."
5,A book of adresses that are really good.,I think that the book has alot of adresses of people from billy Idol To Steve Young. You get alot of replies from the people you write to. I thought it was a really good book for people that might want to be in fanclubs. If you get it I hope you enjoy it.
4,Death and Wormholes...,"This collection of ""Farscape"" starts off with the two-parter ""Infinite Possibilities"", as Crichton (or one of him, anyway; long story behind that) discovers more behind his knowledge of wormholes and how it could radically affect the balance of power in the galaxy. It's one of ""Farscape""'s finest episodes, and ends in a truly heart-wrenching finale. On the opposite end, ""Revenging Angel"" goes into a Looney-Tunes inspired direction, while the dark and brooding ""The Choice"" leads into ""Fractures"", a relatively calm adventure which lays out the remainder of the third season (and boy, it's a doozy). As the series' fate is currently in limbo, it's good to kick back with these episodes, especially since the next set of episodes (like the last two-parter of the season) ends on a very high note. YEE-HAH!!!!"
4,Funniest episode ever,"This cd collection is probably one of the best from Farscape to date. Not only is it one of the best seasons, but it contains some of the best episodes from that season. Revenging Angel is easily one of my favourites on the dvd. Funniest episode of anything I have seen in a while. While on death's door and in a coma, John creates a Looney Tune type world to cope. With John as the Road Runner and D'argo as Wile E Coyote, this episode will be sure to keep you laughing for a while. Amazingly, this extremely light and humerous episode is followed by one of the darkest and serious episodes in the show, let alone the season. Yet despite the change in tone from Revenging Angel to The Choice, the plot fits easily and smoothly and was well thought out.Warning, if you have not seen previous shows in the series, there are two different John Chritons on two different ships. You want to see how they got to this point in the series before you watch these shows."
3,"Good, bad and ugly.","I think that 5 DVDs could have been compressed to 3. There is repetition of information in a couple of places and there is no real ""flow"" from one program to the next. The footage is clear and the ommentary is good, but I was left feeling a need for more. I think one or two parts of the films could be skipped altogether. However, it's interesting if you like sharks."
5,I'll Take It!,"But is this another ""Operation Delta Force"" movie or another ""Shark Attack"" movie? Doesn't matter I win either way!"
2,Fire your editor!,"It seems incredible that anyone would write a time traveler story without even giving a nod to the ""Grandfather Effect"". Wondering over that haunted my reading of the entire book.In America Girl SCOUTS not Guides sell cookies.When reading history of the WWII era from contemporary sources almost all sources refer to Russia as opposed to the Soviet Union.The writing became very sloppy in the last hundred odd pages with many words escaping sentences. Slow down and re-read before publishing!"
2,"It's....... ""ok"", but not for me","I generally consider myself to be an alternate history fan. I've read Turtledove and Eric flint among others. I suppose the first thing that stands out about this book is that I don't think it really qualifies as alternate history as opposed to simply techno-military thriller and using, well it's isn't even ""really"" time travel per se but more the parallel universe premise a la Timeline by Michael Crichton, or 1632 by Eric Flint. That said I can see where others might like this book, but me personally, I must decline. The initial premise and the first meetings of the uptimer and downtimer characters takes way too long. I'd even dare to say that with the exception of the time travel event nothing really happens in the first hundred pages. I also felt the characters were not terribly likable. I only got about half-way through before I put it down."
4,Surprisingly smart,"My expectations for this book dropped when I read an interview with Birmingham in which he said that his goal when writing it was to produce the dumbest book ever.However, and possibly despite himself, the book ended up being very smart and is a cut above the average pulp sci-fi/techno thriller as a result. The story's background has been very well thought out, the quality of the writing is excellent and the storyline itself is an absolute hoot. The only downside is the over-long fight scene which dominates the second third of the book.While this book won't change your life (I hope!), it is a fun read and ranks well ahead of most of its' competition."
5,"Awesome, Just Awesome!!!","This is one of the first books I downloaded into my new Kindle 2. I'm not quite a quarter of the way through it and already it's a huge favorite! I'm a fan of alternative history (military and otherwise) and of The Final Countdown movie (which this plot is quite similar, but much more updated since a few decades has passed since that movie came out). If you're like me, this book is a real treat! Get it!"
1,Bleeech!,"Just finished Weapons of Choice, and I am disappointed. The premise of the book is intriguing, but oh-so poorly executed (which is incidentally what should have happened to the rough draft of this story). Central theme? Everyone from the past is an insular, bigoted sexist moron. Author goes out of his way to make everyone in the '40s apart from intellectuals like Einstein seem like knuckle-dragging scum, and he doesn't do much better with the cast from the future either. His explanations for various important events in the story are absent. His character development, when he bothers to do any, runs to stereotypes and blatantly contradicts itself numerous times. Also, the book was published in a large paperback size, and was not worth the retail price.I've changed my mind about this book since I wrote all this down; I no longer dislike it.I HATE IT!!"
4,Great read,"As a person who likes WW2 Naval history and weapons tech, this seems like the perfect marriage. Birmingham has a great start with this book. He tells an exciting tale and puts good depth in his characters, so that you can and want to follow them. I am waiting for the next two books. I will also say that his commentary on our future society being inure to violence and destruction is thought provoking. It is a topic that carries validity even today, as CNN beams images of Marines fighting to us as we eat breakfast, safe in our kitchens."
2,Oh please,"I love the concept that Birmingham deals with.However...Let's just think about this for a second.The major issue of book 1 is that there is a 2020 fleet with a carrier back in 1942 that grapples with the Japanese pacific fleet and is instrumental in rescuing POW's from that theater.That carrier has several AWAC's aircraft with several thousand miles ranges and extensive loitering capabilities along with a few (albeit not a full compliment by plot device) strike fighters.Those strike fighters with precision munitions (even not satellite guided) would devastate any WWII fleet, even in port.What ship (even the final climactic event) could get close enough to damage them?<sheesh>Book 2 is even worse. I'll post there in a minute."
5,Outstanding,Awesome future warfare and technology driven can't stop reading action packed likeable and despicable characters. Can't wait to read the next one.
1,Just plain bad,"Its a sad commentary when Turtledove is less biased in his PC commentary than this book is. This book is misnamed it should be called ""Politically Correct Super People VS The Dead White Males of The Past.""The book is so pc it reads like a joke the people from the future are all paragons of virtue. While the people from the past are all racist smelly homophobes. Trashing the generation that made it possible for you to write this book in order to preach pc rhetoric just doesnt cut it for me."
2,Fair but not Good,"I have to agree with a majority of the observations that Matt Kaufman made. I will not repeat his observations but will add some of my own without revealing some good plot twists.The most obvious is why the nuclear option was not discussed anywhere in the first book. I also do not think the advances in military culture (large numbers of women in high places and on subs) and technology could take place in just another 15 years, maybe 40 years from now but not by 2021. The twist at the end is also hard to fathom, but I will let you decide. The book is an interesting read, but I am not sure if I will read the next one at full price. 2.5 stars but that is not an option"
2,Tom Clancy meets the final countdown,"I bought the book partly because of the reviews by other readers, and frankly don't understand what the fuzz is all about. The concept of the book was 'borrowed' from the movie 'the final countdown' and rather un-original. The techo-stuff is ok, but the characters are very flat and don't seem to have a personality, besides their miltary role. True, the culture-stuff is mildly entertaining but after a few pages you get point. The way the book is structured is not very original either and probably 'borrowed' from Red Storm Rising from Tom Calncy, which by the way was a lot more fun to read. However, I did want to finish the book so it wasn't a total waste of time, but I won't be bothered buying the next one"
5,"Great book, and I could not put it down!","I don't normally read action or military books, but I couldn't resist this one because of the great concept. I wanted to see how the author would develop this plot, after an entire fleet is displaced into the past by a bad science experiment. I could not put this book down! I loved the little tidbits of ""history"" throughout the book, and it was really interesting to see the author's view on how certain things turned out after our current history. The characters were very well-described and felt real. The military aspects seem legitimate to me, but I'm not knowledgeable about a lot of that. The plot was interesting, and the book was very well written. Highly recommend this!!"
2,"Dull, unimaginative,boring....","What a relief to finish this unimaginative book. I was sorely disappointed after having read the reviews. My only wish is that the muslim extremist had succeeded in blowning up the ship at the end and this silly ""trilogy"" would die the quick death it deserves. The pacing was painfully slow, the characters were numerous and not one of them were developed into anything that would make one care whether they survived or not. I wish a black hole would swallow this whole book away where it belongs...There are so many better books out there that to say this book is anything but lousy is a wonder. What do these people read who rate this book worthy of anything other than kindling? They must read worse books than this so that this looks good in comparison. Good grief.Do yourself a favor and pass this by."
2,Good social differences bad everything else,"Islamic terrorism is the order of the day, club them with nazis and wormongering japs and america's enemies are complete. Ridiculous is the word that comes to mind while reading this book. The author is simply ridiculous in putting forward 21st century technology in the hands of the allies instead of using it to stop the war without shedding blood. Interesting to note that a jap (yamamoto) and a nazi seemed to be the most sensible people in the story."
3,I really feel the need to correct your misconception,"Hilary Clinton is not billed as ""the greatest president ever"" claiming that is what the book says is either sloppy reading or conservative propaganda. What it says is that she; ""is the most uncompromising wartime president,"" that is a different kettle of corn.Hilary Clinton is pretty much uncompromising in general so its not out of line to assume this crazy stonewalling would extend to war time.That being said the book is really, reallly, really, bad. This guy writes like a three year old and his characters are one-dimensional.But you know the part that makes me the most angry?Gosh darn him for positively portraying strong women and homosexuals!That really makes me angry, I'm glad the rest of these fine amazonheads are here to make sure that people know women don't have souls and should shut up and know their role and that homosexuals are an abomination!Oh wait...that's retarded..."
2,No one from 1942 behaves realistically in the last 2/3 of the book,"The first third of the book was interesting in a Tom Clancy-esqe near future meets the past with a bang sort of way.However, after the inital encounter, no one from 1942 behaves the way that real Allied leaders would have behaved in 1942. The task force from the future had enough information and firepower to take out the leadership of all the Axis powers *easily* and likely end the war immediately, yet they do nothing of the sort.But that would mean no sequel books!"
4,Good idea,"Similar to the movie The Final Countdown, but more futuristic. Whether you believe in time travel oralternate realities, this book is still entertainig. Waiting to read the second book now."
1,Mike,"A BIG disappointment. The author shares the same qualities as Tom Clancy in that he is great at producing a good technological yarn when it comes to conflict. Character development, on the other hand, is HORRIBLE. Every one of the 1942 era individuals in the book is a borderline fascist, homophobe, bigot, etc., while the ""modern"" 21st protagonists vary between incredibly shallow, two-dimensional characters (the women in particular make Lara Croft seem like DaVinci) or smug and self-righteous. If you want a better read, stick with Harry Turtledove."
1,Waste of Money! Don't buy it!,"I tried, I really tried. I bought part 2 of the trilogy but it was too hard to follow. So I bought this, the 1st of his trilogy, but it's hard to follow a story that sounds like it's written by a 13 year old. The worst part of the story is the vulgar language the author uses. So much foul language and racist remarks make me wish I never spent money on this book and his part 2 of the trilogy.... I WON'T be wasting my money on the 3rd book"
2,eh....more like 2 1/2 stars,"This Author knows how to write but his story structure needs some serious work. That opening battle sequence...WAY too drawn out. I was starting to skim over the pages wondering to myself, is this ever going to end? Especially since I hadn't developed an emotional attachment to any of the characters yet so I really didn't get into the beginning. Less is more or so the old saying goes or should have gone for this book. Overall, it's an interesting idea for a story but not told very well. I may or may not read the next one. I don't think I will lose any sleep over it if I miss it."
4,A warning- some books missing pages 49 through 80,"My copy of this book, 2005 Ballantine mass market edition ISBN 0-345-45713-7 is missing pages 49 through 80. I thought this was a fluke, but the ""Weapons of Choice"" I checked in the county library had the same problem. This is extremely annoying issue in an otherwise interesting book. You can read about every other missing page on google preview pages, but where was proofing and quality control on this printing? I've searched online regarding this without finding anything. I don't know how extensive this printing error was distributed. My copy has the older red and black cover. If you order it, check the pages to make sure you have a complete copy."
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I downloaded it because it was free. After reading some of the other reviews, I had my doubts about it. Indeed it does have shortcomings that other reviewers have pointed out, such as the opening meeting engagement taking entirely too long, and most of the characters being two-dimensional.Once you get past the opening meeting engagement, the story moves along nicely. The clash of cultures is done well, as are the political elements. Yamamoto is a surprisingly sympathetic and engaging character, as well as a formidable adversary.All in all, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. People who have an interest in, and knowledge about, military matters in general and WWII in particular will likely enjoy it most. Can't imagine that too many women would enjoy it, as it seems to definitely be a guy's book. If you've got a Kindle, it's a free download right now and it's worth every penny."
3,"Had promise, interesting concept. Not as good as I expected","""Weapons of Choice"" is not as good as I expected. As the other reviewers have covered the plot, I will just add that I was distracted in the story development by the multiple story lines, the inconsistency in the characters, and the somewhat boring middle of the book.There also was only a limited climax, and the book just left me feeling that I did not want to read anymore of this story. So I will pass on the next books. I do hope they are better, but ""Weapons of Choice"" while predicated on an interesting subject, and a book which did have potential, failed to live up to what I was looking for in a novel."
5,Very good book!,"I love history and alternate history books.Birmingham did his research well, both in science and history. He handles the introduction of 2021 technology and culture to 1942 very well and makes it very believable.While reading the ebook, I kept googling (looking up) historical characters such as Spruance, Halsey, and Skorzeny. That increased my enjoyment of the book.I'm about to read Final Impact and hoping the 3rd book will be released in ebook format soon!"
4,"My Review for ""Weapons of Choice""...","If your new to the alternate history type books, this is a good one to start with. It was a bit slow in the beginning but after the first 10 pages it sped up quite nicely. By the end of ""Weapons of Choice"" I was ready for the second book of the Axis Trilogy.This book also describes the prejudices that were rampant of the time period quite well. You may be put off at first by the bluntness of the prejudices that the writer seems to want others to see from that era, but, stick with it. It adds a great deal to the storyline and shows how we've progressed from that era to what might be in the future.Those that are Alternate History fans will love this and will want to read the second book soon after. I hope the author reads these reviews, if so, I wish to let him know that I anxiously await the next book in the ""Axis of Time"" Trilogy. -- Wilford Tibbetts"
2,Look good but doesn't cut well.,"This is a beautiful knife. Nicely balanced and well made. But I can't get it as sharp as my other knives. I guess it's OK for the price, but I've had much better luck with other low-cost brands...particularly Ikea knives."
3,"Psi-Man : Main Street D.O.a (Psi-Man, 3).",I enjoyed yet another book in this series. Would suggest this series to anyone who enjoyes reading about the power of the mind.
4,"Excellent, Complete Edition","This is a first rate edition of Housman's poetry and considerably more, including some of his prose and letters. The latter will largely be of interest to scholars and most will read this book for the poetry. As a poet, Housman's reputation rests on his 2 slender collections, A Shropshire Lad, and Last Poems. Some additional poems, including deft parodies, were published posthumously, but the real meat is in Shropshire and Last.Preoccupation with death, the transience of life and youth, and frustrated love are the themes of this poetry. Housman's relatively short, powerful lyrics, direct style, and remarkably evocative phrases (has anyone ever described a youthful relaxed summer better than ""the idle hill of summer"") make many of these poems among the most anthologized in the English language."
5,Warrior Lilith: A collection present more then a toy,My friend has always collected figures of didn't action figures of women. This will make a great addition to her collection and really is cute - I almost want to keep it!!Warrior Lilith: Spawn Mutations Series 23 /Ultra-Action Figures
4,useful framework about collective violence,"Tilly is probably best known for his theories about state violence, but here he turns to collective or non-state violence. He categorizes collective violence along a spectrum or coordination amongst members and political salience of any damage that occurs. The book is also a tour de force of various types of collective violence (at least circa 2001 in the last edition). Definitely recommended for students of collective violence."
4,He did it again!,"Charles Tilly, one of the most productive and creative sociologists of our time, is regaling us with one more theoretical landmark. Collective violence is not what it seems under our common sense eyes. We begin to see a new reality when we use the lens he has fashioned for us."
4,Bossa Nova,Love the CD - the music is great for background at parties and for easy listening ay dinner. Getz is always great!
5,How to define easy listening?,"After a hard days work. What puts your mind to rest? Levels the adrenaline output? Refreshes your mind? Recharges your whole system and puts you in a great mood? This is not the one and only CD where every note is superbly composed, played with the greatest experience and a very well balanced arrangement. But probably the one that describes easy listening best. And it is a worthy experience to listen to this one closely as well."
3,grbouder56,"Getz and Byrd, what more needs to be said. Although these two did not care much for each other much on a personal level. They have created, in this album the start of GREAT bossa nova music. Acually, I am listening to this piece as I write this review. If you do not have it, you are missing out on a beautiful gig."
2,Bad Technology....,"What a disappointment.I thought that ""original recording remastered"" would solve all the problems associated with recordings of this era. I've owned my CD player (Yamaha-very good quality) for 10 years, and thought I wouldn't lose anything. But, I was wrong.Key musical points in the CD are lost, and while the music is some of the best ever recorded, you just can't hide from the lack of technology.The music is wonderful. Wait for the original to be ""digitally remastered."" I don't know if this will solve the problem. I am no expert on audio. I only know this recording could be much improved."
3,Gorgeously tired,"3 1/2Relaxed classic known for being the first full-fledged American bossa nova record is not exactly gripping, but still tightly chill enough to constitute compositional significance, with the Getz/Byrd dynamic lending to some interesting synergy. Not quite the landmark of next years Gilberto collaboration, but completely important in its own right."
1,"Remastered maybe, but definitely lacking","There is some good music here to be sure but I can't help but feel that the product is badly let down by poor value and packaging. I am annoyed that consumers are asked to pay for 60+mins of music only to receive 35.07mins. There is a great deal of empty space on sale in this CD. This re-issuing caper is not new. If a premium price is to be asked, a good strategy (demonstrated by many other examples) is to bundle up the vinyl release with other material as it goes to CD. If Verve/PolyGram are interested in delivering value then they should have got it somewhere closer to the 75min that's possible. The other problem that I have with this CD is the incredibly poor design of the CD wallet. The booklet provided within has the infuriating habit of slipping out. And why shouldn't it - there is nothing to hold it in! Were the folk at Verve/PolyGram to design automobiles then occupants could expect to be dumped on the roadside at each and every corner."
5,A Jazz Essential,"Almost 40 years old, and still the standard by which all other Bossa Nova albums must be judged. It remains a delight to the ears no matter how many times it gets played, and is never far from my stereo. Truely one of the great jazz albums ever made. I hope you and Stan are jammin' now, Charlie."
5,One of the great jazz fusion albums of our time,This is a great way to be introduced to the fusion of jazz and samba. One of the finest recordings of our times. A must buy for the serious jazz collector.
5,A Great Coming of Age Book,"Between Planets was the second Heinlein juvenile I read as a kid, and like Have Space Suit Will Travel, I have reread it thousands of times since.I love the vintage early 50s vision of Mars and Venus as habitable---it was proven wrong of course, but it has a great sensibility and atmosphere to it that transports you to an alternate reality and an alternate future.I found Don, the main character, to be not quite as relatable as Kip from HSWT but he was much closer to being an everyman. It was very entertaining seeing an interplanetary revolution through the eyes of a ground-pounding teenaged soldier.All of Heinlein's juveniles were good reads, but this one remains one of my favorites."
5,Riveting As Usual,The standard of Mr. Heinlein's work never fails to amaze me. This book is a great addition to anyone's Heinlein collection.
4,Heinlein was a revolutionary at heart . . .,"This is an expanded version of a story that originally appeared in Blue Book Magazine, but it still reads in a somewhat hurried way; at 190 pages, it would have benefitted from being expanded even farther. Still, it's a workmanlike juvenile about young Don Harvey, born out in space to a Terran father and a Venusian colonial mother -- who are now working on Mars in any case. He's attending school on Earth as a colonial rebellion is breaking out, finds himself an ""enemy alien,"" and just manages to get off-world. He's also an unwitting courier for a shadowy, underground political group his parents are involved with. His adventures build as he gets caught up in events and the story is a straightforward adventure, better told than many of Heinlein's later books."
3,Enjoyable tale,"I've read some of Heinlein's other short stories - Puppet Masters, Double Star, etc - and enjoyed them, but I can;t say that I enjoyed this one as much. It's not a bad story, mind you, but for me, it just didn't make me feel or think as his other stories. It's about a teenage boy who's of mixed descent (Earth and Venus) and doesn't really explore much into the past or explore weighty matters. It was more of a 'light' reading, not as deep or thought-provoking as most other his other work. If you're a Heinlein fan, it won;'t hurt to check this story out, but if you're new, I recommend 'The Past through Tomorrow', 'The Moon is a Harsh mistress', or 'Stranger in a Strange Land'."
2,"Aw, Shucks!","I give this book only 2 stars because, well, compared to great literature, 'Between Planets' is what it is; a 1950's pulp sci-fi novella.But that's not to say it isn't a solid, well-written story; it is. It's a bit dated, a bit simplistic, and a bit of fun.Save this for a cross-country flight, or some other occasion you need to kill time. You're not missing anything if you don't read it.It's a decent, solid novella that would earn any college student an 'A+' in a fiction-composition class."
3,"Not bad, not ""must-read"" either","I love Heinlein's fiction. He is the great author. But this book is not the one of his best ones. There is action, there is story, it's nice to read, and it's not bad if you have to fill transantlantic flight. At least you will not feal bad after it (a lot of books does not have this important feature :-( ) But if you will not read it, you will not lose much. That's it."
4,"Great costumes, bur durabilty is a issue","I think that the clown costume rocks, but it should make their zippers strong because they can be easily ripped off and the material for the costume can easily get holes so the durabilty can be 1 to 3 Halloweens."
3,Cute but have lots of batteries,This is a cute costume. I bought it to use to celebrate Halloween with my second grade class. It requires many batteries because they die rather quickly. Costume can be worn not inflated--it isn't as cute but it still looks like a pumpkin.
1,Picture doesnt match order,I didnt recive the model i order well the one in the picture. if you are going to sell something put the right picture deceiving.
5,Perfect for collectors,"Great item! The details are incredible! You must see to believe, specially paying less than 10 buck on it. It's the first of many i pretend to buy in the next months finally starting a collection of something and I'm glad I started so good. The item looks so good that I'm not even going to take it out of its plastic, it looks to good to just stay around collecting dust, this one will be a total collectors item. Maybe in couple years I will be selling this on ebay for a lot."
5,awesome flask for fisherman,"My brother-in-law loved this, it was his birthday gift, he is the envy of many trout fishermen in the area with this most festive and ornamental yet working flask. Great for nip of whiskey on a cold day on the lake!"
3,We need a remastered version Verve,"This is more than a decade old, and I dont like the sound very much. Verve should really release these tracks in a new compilation with better sound. I prefer the early Billie Holiday, and to me she reached her peak at her last sessions for Columbia. I'd strongly recommend to anyone just getting into Bilie to check the Columbia/Legacy stuff first. This is more difficult to appreciate, but stil is great music. Billie is the best jazz singer that ever lived, period."
3,Stormy Weather,"The accompanied booklet said that in technical terms, ""her post-war singing has been dismised by many critics."" While her voice may have become more harsh, her emotional depth is greater. She sounds to me how I always expected her to sound. My favorite is Stormy Weather. I can't get enough. This one song is the reason I bought the whole set, and it was well worth it."
3,Proceed with caution,"Billie Holiday's recordings for Verve are the easiest to find. But, proceed with caution. By this time, her voice was beginning to deteriorate and become raspy. Sure, she was also gaining better control of her abilities and therefore could insert endless nuances to make up for it. But, I wouldn't suggest this era to someone just starting to learn about Ms. Holiday's work. Try something from the Columbia or Decca years. While there are quite a few gems here, her voice by this time is an acquired taste."
3,Jump-Start,"To start with:1: The previous reviewer misread the backcover summary: it says ""That you will need other equipment: chairs, groceries...) to create a fitness program. This is necessary for total fitness.2: There could be more in this book but there isn't. There is the Buddy Lee book that has more like: the biomechanics of rope jumping.Or Ropesport which also has DVD's which are a boon because you can see and hear how to do various jumps."
3,"""The Hermes Fall"" falls just short","Like the other cosmic impact novels of the late 1970's, most notably Lucifer's Hammer and Shiva Descending, The Hermes Fall tends to get lost in its characters. Still, for those who can find it, it is a rather intriguing read.What sets The Hermes Fall apart from other cosmic disasters is that it focuses on a known asteroid. A five-mile-wide behemoth, Hermes passed within half a million miles of the Earth in 1937. Although much better than Lucifer's Hammer as far as complexity of story, it isn't as good as Shiva Descending or Thunder Strike, by Michael McCollum, because it lacks the emotional elements.If you can find The Hermes Fall, it's worth the read."
3,Driftboats: A Complete Guide,"A fairly good source of information about drift boats (one of very few out there so it may be the best available). It is long on history of drift boats. Good descriptions of rowing tchniques and boat control. The section on reading rivers and how to tackle various situations is fairly good but I would have liked it to be more comprehensive with more drawings. Drift boat safety, equipping the boat, and preparing for trips with check lists were also fairly good. The book is well worth the price and for someone like me without any experience is definitely of value. I would have just liked even more. I recommend googling ""drift boats"" and going through every driftboat manufacturer web site for understanding of the substantial number of available drift boats including wooden, composites, and aluminium. There are also some very good kits. Some of the manufacturers are sources for accessory equipment and articles on technique."
2,Whats going on here ????,Just received the book today havent read it and only skimmed it but whats with the prices shown on the new list? I was expecting it to be bound in leather and trimmed in gold. When it arrived I was a little taken a back. This is an 8.5x11 inch paperback book that you would typically expect to pay around $25 brand new in any mall bookstore. Whats with these $100+ prices? Has someone hacked the Amazon system? I bet they do give good service at those prices. Its certianly makes me more cautious about trusting the prices posted on Amazon. BTW if anyone wants mine for $500 please let me know by posting it on this site.
4,Read it in an afternoon,"This is almost a novella; it can easily be read in an afternoon. I read this after seeing the movie, and it's one of those rare occassions where I like the movie better than the book. The book is still compelling, though. A Navy attack pilot is reluctantly thrust into the Korean War, and seems on the verge of a nervous breakdown. This man wants nothing more than to come home to his wife and kids, all of whom he loves deeply. In case you've never seen it, I highly recommend the 1954 movie with William Holden, Frederic March, Grace Kelly, Mickey Rooney, Earl Holliman. Only minor parts of the story were changed for the movie, otherwise it's very faithful."
4,Fast Paced Michener,"Compared to most of Michener's other large tomes this differs in two immediately noticeable ways. Firstly, it is a very short novel coming in at about 125 pages compared to many that are 1000 pages or more. Secondly it is fast paced compared to many of his other novels.The worlds of war and of peace, highlighted in the first two chapters are brought together in a poignant and thought provoking manner in the final chapter.The subject matter is not pleasant, covering as it does a major war situation in Korea and how it impacts upon many people, but it is a thought provoking publication and worthy of a read - the length and pace making it possible for many readers to read it in one day. The story and message though have lingered with me for much longer."
2,"Pulp Fiction, basically","As usual with Michener, the prose is agile and well-planned, so this short novel is a page-turner. All characters, though, are cardboard clichés without one single shadow of psychological interest or point. Pulp-fiction characters, totally, and thoroughly sentimentalized.The novella's main thesis, ""what a shame that the noble military sacrifice so much while the American people don't really care"", fails to explain why average Americans who are not military contractors or otherwise parasites of the ""defense"" milk-cow should concern themselves about an undeclared war for very far-away imperial turf. The notion entertained by the old admiral that this is simply one further battle in the endless Manichan struggle between the Forces of Light (America) and the Forces of Darkness (The Rest of the Universe) is still very much with us, but is made neither more respectable nor more understandable by this little book."
5,Exciting,This book was fast paced and well written. The authors descriptive powers were excellent. You saw what he described in your mind. The story brought to life the Korean war and what it was like to land a plane on a aircraft carrier. It was way to short and could have been longer.
1,Overrated,Among the publications that present a different view of the Mau Mau and Kenya's history of colonization there is David Anderson's Histories of the Hanged and Caroline Elkins' Imperial Reckoning - the latter won the Pulitzer. From the mouth of an African is W. O. Maloba's Mau Mau and Kenya. A novel should not a history make.
5,A Historic Must-Read,This is one of my favorite books of all time. It is a portrait of Africa you will only see through the eyes of Roark. Why is this book not still printed??
5,Great,I have an original copy but I think it is a great story with just as much truth today as when it was written. When you take away something of value you must replace it with something that has meaning. .
5,i really love them,i am in love with these shoes. i got the ones with the skulls and i get so many compliments. these are the sandals i have been looking for for a few years. they are comfortable-I'm a big girl so it holds me comfortably. i want to find other ones that are similar. thank you thank you thank you thank you! expect more business from me in the future.
3,pleased overall,"Overall i like the look of these but they are not as comfortable as other platform thongs that i own. the straps are made from hard vinyl and gave me blisters the first time I wore them. I do, however, get lots of compliments on them!"
4,"Entertaining fun, although the ActiveX version is funnier.","Entertaining fun, although I though the ActiveX book (same author) was funnier. Check it out too: Mr. Bunny's Guide to ActiveX"
1,Occasionally humorous,"I was given this book by a friend who didn't want his copy anymore. I have since been unsuccessful in passing it off to someone else.Mr. Egremont's humor is hit-or-miss, and mostly, it misses. It seems clear that he has some knowledge of the Java language, but for the book to qualify as a humorous parody, I expect the jokes to be more relevant and less nonsensical."
1,Tries to be Funny & Informative. Fails.,"While I don't have anything against using a *little* humor to get a point across, the entire point of this book is apparently to be humorous while trying to be an introduction to the Java language. It fails in both respects. It is so heavily laced with attempts at over-the-top humor that it becomes unreadable. The reader is left sifting the text for actual information about Java, and often coming up empty-handed. I finally concluded that this book is actually intended for *experienced* Java programmers who have the background to appreciate the humor, but who obviously would have had to have learned their Java elsewhere."
1,This company is probably out of business,"Their phone number is busy 24/7, they never billed for an order I made and they never answer their emails (I have sent many)."
4,too small but cute,I bought this doll for my daughter's 1st birthday but she didn't care about it. Maybe it's too small. hopefully she will like as much as i do.
5,Love It!,"My daughter - now 14 months - has two of these dolls. One at home and one for day care. She sleeps with them and loves them!We got one as a ""new baby"" present and when she decided it was her favorite I bought a back-up. We've washed them numerous times and haven't had any problems. One of the great things about this doll is that she's so light... any small child can drag her around with no problem. Definately a great first doll for any little girl."
2,Shameful remix of a classic album,"This digital remix from the original analog multi-track tapes is a disaster. Why do today's engineers insist on second guessing the marvelous work of previous generations? On Ipanema, the new modified balance between Getz and Astrud is terrible. Getz's sax utterly overpowers her delicate voice. And the new widened soundstage has Astrud so far off to the right that she sounds like she's in another room.I'm listening to this remixed CD using a top-end audiophile CD player and the warmth of the original mix is very much lacking. So is the crystalline clarity of the vocals, which is now lost to the overemphasized highs. I'm comparing directly with the original release of the song ""...Ipanema"", found on the 2xCD set titled ""Stan Getz: The Best of the Verve Years, Vol. 1"". There, the song sounds fabulous; just like on the lovely LP. This new remixed Getz/Gilberto CD is a stinker, as are so many remixed classics. Look for this album on vinyl or original mix CD."
5,Something about Samba,"This will just be a short review..this CD is absolutely wonderful. I am not going to compare it to anything...I'm not even going to try and describe it other than to say it brings me an incredible amount of joy. It's sexy cool, it's flippin' hot.It's just right for a night of loving.My only complaint is that it is too short...but maybe that's the genius of it because it made me crave other music by both Getz and Gilberto.So I'm going to let you stop reading and let you purchase this beautiful recording."
5,The Precedent Setter,This album has all the famous songs that embody 1960's bossa nova. The recordings have good sound quality and it is a pleasure to listen to.
5,Getz Gilberto,The best of Stan Getz and Austrid Gilberto. Classic Brazilian jazz with Getz saxaphone makes this a super fun cd to listen to if your into the Brazilian beat!!!
5,Great Bossa Nova,I read the reviews and I love Astrud Gilberto so I was sure I'd love this. And I do. Great music. Instant Classic.
4,Intimately Intriguing,"An old favorite recording from the `60s featuring music by Antonio Carlos Jobim, Getz/Gilberto was given the full-blown GAIN System treatment by MFSL. The result is a sonic and musical feast for the ears, but a feast of subtleties, little inflections of rhythm from the drums, quiet chords on piano and guitar, the gently probing saxophone of Stan Getz weaving in and out of the melodies, and the quiet, intriguing voices of Mr. and Mrs. Gilberto. There may be a whole generation of audiophiles who never heard this the first time around: thanks to MFSL, they can now join in the fun of hearing master musicians work together in an intimate yet international musical setting."
5,Beautiful,"This is a classic and worth its great reputation. No wonder it has remained popular for so many, many years. It is one of the few albums I enjoyed as a teenager and still enjoy 40 years later!"
5,What a sound,"For me, the work of Gilberto et. al in the rhythm section is good, but what sets this alblum apart is the inimitable sound of Stan Getz. His sound always makes me imagine waking gently from a long night's sleep to discover a beautiful nude woman in my room, stretching and yawning in the morning sunlight.There's not much more mellow in this world than that."
5,Un clásico del Bossa-nova...Getz y Gilberto!!!!,"Este cd , realizado en 1964, es un testimonio vivo del revolucionario ritmo que invadió America por esos años y cuya cuna, Rio de Janeiro (Brasil), ha legado una serie de temas musicales imperecederos donde la inventiva del gran compositor Antonio Carlos Jobim brilla en toda plenitud.Stan Getz, legendario saxofonista norteamericano y los esposos Gilberto (Joao y Astrud) nos deleitan con una serie de temas clásicos de este embriagante ritmo como ""The Girl from Ipanema"", ""Desafinado"", ""Corcovado"", ""O Grande Amor"" donde escuchamos música delicada, posesiva, cautivadora y que sigue embelezando a medio mundo.Escuhar la interesante, profunda y cautivadora voz de Joao Gilberto es toda una experiencia. La restauración sonora de esta producción es realmente excelente. Disfrutemos de este maravillosos disco."
5,Classic Brazilian Jazz,This CD is a must for people who like to have a well rounded Jazz CD collection. I consider this CD as one of my favorites. I highly recommend it to anyone building a Jazz library.
4,"Cool, man!",Love cool jazz and this romantic CD has been a pleasure for us and has made a few evenings in front of the fireplace very memorable indeed! Thanks.
3,"Great Album, but terribly mastered","Upon hearing the original vinyl pressing, I wanted to have a copy to put my SACD player to use. I was very disappointed in the mastering of this SACD. THe recording levels were much too high, and there was no dynamic range to speak of. There were even times that I could notice distortion. THis was regardless of volume level or between the high end sony and toshiba players.Go out and get the original vinyl, and made sure verve records didn't produce it."
3,REMASTERING HAS FLAWS....,"I love this album, but when the recording studios decided to do a remastering of the original, I went out to purchase it. WHAT A DUD!!! The only songs worth listening to are ""Girl from Ipanema"", ""So Danco Samba"", and ""Desafinado"". LOTS OF HISS NOISES AND OTHER NASTY STUFF. Not worth the purchase for this one. I hope they decide to do another remastering."
5,favorite,"I think this remastered album is my favorite of all I've ever owned. A real masterpiece, never fails to sooth me and remind me how pleasant and special life really is. I was born a few months after it was released, but I grew up with and grew attached to songs from the original."
5,Stan breathes out blue velvet fog . 10 stars **********,"My all-time favorite jazz recording. 10 stars!! The best introduction to jazz, Cool Jazz, Samba, and Bossa Nova. Stan Getz makes each note sound beautiful, and three-dimensional, as if it were sculpted in blue velvet fog. Stan sounds less as if he was playing the sax than breathing the notes out from his soul. His contemporaries called him ""The Sound"".Joao Gilberto sings and wife Astrud sings with a rather small voice. Intimate and romantic. For more Stan and less singing, ""Jazz Samba"" is similar but all instrumental.Technical note: The recorded this record at 30ips tape speed when the industry standard was 15ips. Spectacularly well recorded, it sounds like it was recorded yesterday, not 35 years ago, on the new VERVE 20 bit version ONLY. Try listening on a Single Ended Triode Amp for the ultimate!"
4,Latin/Jazz by the Brazilians that launched the Bossa Nova,"The quintessential Latin/Jazz recording by the two Brazilians that launched the Bossa Nova movement. Recorded March 18th and 19th, 1963 in New York City by Phil Ramone, this disc features the classic Portuguese-English version of ""The Girl From Ipanema"" with vocals by the lovely and talented Astrud Gilberto. A must have for every Jazz collection."
5,BUY IT,"Extremely romantic, easy, simple, absolutely beautiful. It's a masterpiece that should be in *anyone's* collection! Buy it...you will not be disappointed."
5,Disarmingly (and alarmingly) cool,"Yes, yes, yes. This record will get you laid, Shallow Hal. And for the not so shallow among you, this will not only lay you, it will make you levitate. Why? Cause this is bossa nova, this is muito natural. So there, invest in yourself and get this album."
5,* Bossa Nova Masterpiece *,"If you already like bossa nova (or would like to know) this recording is a ""must have"". It is a masterpiece that showcases Joo Gilberto and Tom Jobim at the top of their musical creativity. All Jobim's compositions on this record became standards for musicians and listeners all over the world. Furthermore, Joo Gilberto's unique of way of approaching singing and guitar playing is a delightful and sophisticated musical experience. This CD had a major importance in introducing the world with ""Bossa Nova"", a new musical style. Getz understood the bossa nova concept, which is very clear in his beautiful solos -- where he also brings a jazz structure to the blend. It is a timeless piece. Enjoy it."
5,One of my top five all time CDs,"This is a real all-time classic CD. Rarely, the combination of non Brazilian Jazz and Samba musicians suggests this level of sophistication, rhythm and delicate energy. The recording appeals both to people that don't really like Jazz, and to real Jazz fans. Buy it! You will not regret."
4,Bossa Nova Classics,"This is a significant CD of Bossa Nova classics. Performers are top-notched saxophonist Stan Fetz, guitarist and vocalist Joao Gilberto and pianist Antonio Carlos Jobim. Orchestration is perfect and couldn't be done better. Recorded in 1963, remastered and released in 1998, it added to the popularity of Astrud Gilberto, who held a concert in 1996. This CD is a must-have for all jazz lovers and beginners."
5,Nothing but love.,"Granted I was not born when this piece of work was created, I have not heard a more lovely and artistic jazz creation. Getz, Gilberto and Jobim connect in a way that their independent sounds are melded into one full-bodied aural pleasure.This remastered version delivers a clearer sound than the original version, and a good sound system will allow you to appreciate it. In addition, the liner notes are very nice - especially regarding the addition of Astrud Gilberto in spite of her husband's wishes. By the way, I'm glad she made the cut!"
5,Classic Jazz-Bossa,"This is a wonderful album that just gets better as the years go by. I recommend it and Gilberto's ""Chega de Saudade."" There is also great background material about ""Getz/Gilbert"" and bossa nova in the book ""The Brazilian Sound,"" which definitely adds to one's appreciation of the music."
4,Best Version of the Jazz Classic That's Out There!,"This mini-lp sleeve version of this Jazz classic is the best version that's out there at the moment. The remastering job is quite good and so the sound quality is decent. We also get both the English and Japanese lyrics thrown in as an insert. The cardboard packaging which is a replica of the original vinyl sleeve is also a work of art. While the strength of ""Girl From Ipanema"" alone would carry this album, we also get ""So Danco Samba"" and a version of ""Desafinado"" here which is good but not as great as the brilliant version with that unforgetable Getz solo on the ""Jazz Samba"" album which although not as commercially successful as this album, is still overall the stronger album. Still, there is no denying the great impact this album has had on jazz and on bringing the whole samba genre onto the world map that this is still essential listening for fans of jazz and indeed for any fan of music in general. Recommended."
3,"Must have jazz title, but dated","You can't be a serious jazz fan and not own this album. That's for sure. I bought it expecting more, but it took me back to listening to my parents' records on the dining room floor in front of the console stereo. The sound and style are very dated, which is not necessarily a bad thing. And sure, I was young and carefree in the 60's, but I won't be playing this album much except when I need to practice some ""Ipanema"" licks before a gig. That is to say, as good as it is, and even though it is a cornerstone of Latin jazz, I won't listen to it very often, at all."
2,"Watch Out for ""Original Recording Remasterd"" CD's.....","How frustrating.....if you have a stereo CD player that's more than 10 years old, then don't buy this CD. While the music is great, you lose key phrasings to the low technology of the original recordings.1/2 of vocals of the ""Girl from Impanema"" is but a whisper.Great CD....but, be warned."
2,old style jazz,Someone had recommended this CD to me but I was disappointed. It is very slow and very french.
5,Updated work by Mark Bando,"Mark A. Bando has followed up his original Screaming Eagles in Normandy work with this update which not only plays upon his first book about the 101st in Normandy but presents new photos gleaned from his tireless work with veterans and their families. It's amazing how many troopers took cameras into Normandy and how great it is to be able to read of their exploits and see the shots they took. Bando is not just a great researcher of the 101st but has become so close to the men and their families that he has unmatched access to information, comments and photos that make Bando's work a ""must read"" for those of us interested in the 101st ABN in WWII. I can't wait to see more of his books."
4,Good,This book was pretty good. It gave good definitions with examples so that I was never lost when my teacher used terms I was previously unfamiliar with.
1,terrible buy!!!,I paid 60 dollars for this book and all I got in the mail was the pages and a makeshift binding. Do not purchase from this salesperson!!
1,bad,i am very upset. i did not recieve the right book an you all said you would send me the right one an i never received it!
5,It made me HAPPY by just reading it!!!,Nora Roberts is the best and most versitile writer I have ever read. The Perfect Neighbor was so bubbly and bouncy it made me giggle just reading it. It's a page turner for sure!
2,Rude man,"If you like men who kick puppies, you'll enjoy this book. Okay, I admit that is a little harsh, but Preston McQuinn is a rude, brooding male. Cybil is an effervescent, sunny, extremely talkative gal. Her constant dialogue and her continued attempts to ""help"" the guy across the hall who is deceiving her is annoying. In defense of my earlier statement, he literally and figuratively slams the door in Cybil's face but she keeps returning for more abuse (hence the puppy analogy). In the end she wins this prize of a man, sorry for the spoiler."
4,The Perfect Neighbor,"Cybil Campbell can't help but be curious about the handsome, mysterious neighbor who has just moved in next door. She tries to be friendly, but he resists her attempts at friendship and stays behind closed doors, a man who apparently has no job, no friends, and no interest in getting to know Cybil. Finally, she breaks through his reserve, but he still keeps many things hidden from her. Nora Roberts' romances are predictable, but it's fun to see how she gets two stubborn people together. This is part of the MacGregor series, and Grandfather Daniel, as always, makes an appearance."
4,The Perfect Neighbor was good and funny!,"The book kept my interest throughout. It had its peaks and it was funny at times. I liked the characters. It was an easy read and very relaxing! It was not action packed, but it was very cute and relaxing. Just a very nice story."
3,The Perfect Neighbor,Very predictable. Pretty run of the mill. It was entertaining enough. Not a complete waste of time but easy to put down and go back to read at one's leisure.
4,Another masterpiece in the McGregor saga!,"I've been hooked on this family since the Serena-Caine novel. The warmth of the family is beautifully captured each time. It is lovely to be able to peek into such a wonderfully quirky family! It is espeically nice to encounter characters from past novels still happily engrossed in their love, passion, and battles! So good, that I've already read it five times!"
4,Loved It!!,"I really loved this Nora Roberts book. The MacGrerors are becoming my favorite family, I only wish I was a member. I have read the whole series and I hope that Ms. Roberts plans to continue with the rest of Daniel and Anna's granchildren and even great-grandchildren. I can't wait for the next book!!!!"
5,The Perfect Neighbor (The MacGregors),"As with all of the MacGregor series, I truly enjoyed this book. I am looking forward to reading more about the MacGregor family."
2,Needs alot of work,"I just got this add-on earlier today, and it's ok. The graphics are nice, but much more could of gone into this one. Their are no headlights, so if you drive at night you won't be able to see anything. The speed limit never changes,even when you approach a station, and that includes the final station(s). Abacus could of done so much more with this one. This one really doesn't insoire me to buy anymore of their add-ons, as they should of given this one away for free."
5,Reconnect with some beautiful jazz!,"Jazz (early combos, big band, bebop, progressive, fusion) and the music of the world's great symphony orchestras defined and shaped my childhood. I LOVED my dad's huge collection of albums (remember those)? I connected at some deep level with the artwork, and the music was just awesome. So I was thrilled to find Kenny Burrell's ""Guitar Forms"" available on Amazon. I ended up ordering an import CD from Japan because it preserved the original tracks from the original LP. Some of the other offerings added things that, in my humble opinion, ruined the cohesiveness of the whole package.Burrell's clean, warm guitar is nicely showcased in Gil Evans' arrangements. It's the epitome of 1960s California cool!! The rest of the ensemble perform with flawless artistry. Great for studying by, for entertaining a date over dinner, for doing housework or other chores!! Buy it today!"
3,great sound/tunes less than desirable,great guitar sounds-besides downstairs though tune selection is a bit suspect-if you want one kenny burrell cd i wouldn't suggest this one
1,Ya Get What Ya Pay For,"Well, I went on the cheap and bought it to cover my patio table for the winter. The thing is already torn to shreds and I only had it on the table for about a month."
5,A Great Read,"I found this book to be highly entertaining, and an enjoyable read. I would rank it with ""The Glory of Their Times"" as my 2 favorite baseball books. The only negative, it was too short."
5,Where has this book been?,"This is a tremendously entertaining and well-written book, leading me to wonder why in the world no one tapped into this invaluable source of baseball history until he was 90 years old. I haven't read a baseball book this good since the Boys of Summer came out."
2,earl grey more like,"I must be missing something , but you yankee chappys dont seem to understand the basics of rock music. I mean i have harder rocks in my toothpaste than this , its dreary and dull and not worthy as they say. Earl grey anyone ??"
2,Small and ripped easily,"I've had many other character themed wall stickers that I've purchased for my son, and these are by far the lowest quality yet the highest priced. I bought the T-rex, Stegasaurus, and Triceratops and all are smaller than I expected. Would NOT purchase again!"
4,Very Cute,I bought this for my 2 yr olds room. It is realistic without being even remotely scary. It is currently his favorite dinosaur on his wall.
1,Very Small.,Very SmallSpend a few more dollars and you can get a 3ft. T Rex!I would not buy again or tell a friend.
1,Ruined wall,We used this product for a dinosaur themed room. After while we dedided to make some changes to the alls and it tore all of the paint off of the wall under the decall almost down to the drywall.
3,I do not even know what these things do?!?,You stick them in the water and thats about it I have no clue if they even do anything
2,baby blue,when i opened the package i noticed a plastic/rubbery smell to it I washed it a few times but it's still there. i also noticed it collects lint no matter how I store it. other than that it has a nice size and it does what it's meant to ;)
4,mr softee,It's just like the real thing with a little added length and like real veins to massage your insides!!
2,didn't like it,Too big....and I've had 2 kids.. yucky smell. Discolored after awhile and I tossed it. Save your money. I would also recommend measuring your partner or current toy for size.
2,Too big,My wife says it's too big. She says it's not even comfortable. She prefers the real thing. It is quite big!
3,Not bad,He is BIG! That's the first thing you need to know about this guy. The smell most people are talking about is a very faint rubber smell. A lot like an inflatable pool toy. I honestly couldn't smell it until it was right up next to my nose lol
5,redneck,"This is by far the best sex toy that we have ever owned. We have a alot of different things that hurt my wife when going in even with lube, but not this one. It is just about the same size as me just not as thick as me but it is a little bit longer by about half an inch or so.All the ladies that say it is way to fat made my day. It is the perfect size it could be just a bit thicker. As far the smell yea it smells but not that bad.It does not require much lube and it goes right in.Great for going down on her while using the Mr. Softee.If this one wears out any time soon I will buy 2 more. Every lady out there needs this toy it is wonderful.It is very realistic,soft, and flexible."
3,Too big,I was excited to order this cause I've been looking for a fun toy. When I got it the plastic rubbery odor was horrible. I even washed it a couple times and it didn't go away.Also it's wayy too thick. I tried everything and it didn't work.For someone who can handle how big it is and not mind the odor it's great!
3,Good/okay,"it was a nice toy, but won't recommend it being your first toy. it was too big, took me awhile to adapt to the size. and the smell is very strong. it doesn't smell bad, just when you put it in a drawer it makes everything else smell like it. it started to rip at the top of it within 4 months. still satisfied with it, just wish it wasn't as big or strong smell."
4,Took some getting use to,"This product was very beneficial in my case. I saw the other reviews and I thought I could handle it. At first it was sort of overwhelming, but one day when I was really turned on I gave it another try. I learned to enjoy it. Now I love it's thickness and the length . If you looking for a first time toy. This isn't the one. By the way the smell did not bother me at all."
1,save your money,"At first I loved this big fellow but, it is very difficult to keep it lubed and it requires tons of lube. Even my own lube from the G-spot is not enough. I tried the g-spot lube since bottled lube is not enough but, still it is not enough. I tried petroleum jelly and that made it worse. The material is just not conducive for play for more than a minute. Maybe I can sell it used on Ebay. LOL Karen"
4,"Smells strong, but very ""filling""!","From opening the box, the smell took over my room! He smells fruity, but with an odd chemical-y smell if he's at your face. ""Hidden"" in an open tin, I actually like the smell it makes my room-- it's a naughty air freshener. ;)My only problem is the chemical-y smell, which makes me hold my breath when I'm ""lubricating"" him. When he's down there though, he's wonderful.Having been a couple weeks, I don't expect the smell to go away. I hope it fades, but that's just me hoping.He is pretty thick, very filling.. I'm shopping around for a smaller friend for a more daily use. To be honest, it's more for the escape of the smell than the size- he doesn't make me sore (because of his perfect softness), and I'm a beginner.."
2,Huge,Huge is about all that I can say. I don't think that I was expecting it at all and have not used it much as a result.
1,Stinky Dildo,"You will never loose this item because the odor is SO strong. I thought the strong latex odor would dissipate with time. Even being left out to ""air"" it still has a very strong odor. Also, if you insert it in your anus it stains and it is impossible to get it clean looking again. Would not recommend this item."
3,"Good headset, but small ears beware...","This headset has excellent range and sounds perfect. The cradle is really nice because it doubles as a case to keep it nice and safe. Really easy to use, and the battery life is long.The only thing going against it is the ear clip. If your ears are small like mine AND you wear glasses, beware this headset. I struggled for hours to get it on my ear and finally found the right position, but then I had to keep from moving my head too much as the glasses were slowly pushing the headset off my ear.Overall good if you have big ears and don't wear glasses."
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"The concept of a wireless headset is intriguing. Unfortunately, this design does not fulfill its' promise.First, it is not a comfortable fit. It always felt as though it was about to fall off, and I was always aware of it's presence.Second, it does not work as seamlessly as the wired headset. Voice dialing did not work properly (you could never hear the prompt tone to know when to say the voice command). Without voice dialing, you lose much of the freedom of a headset.Third, you look like a total geek wearing this thing. Not only is it large, but there's also blinking lights to attract attention.Kudos (and gratitude) to Amazon's hassle-free and simple return policy. Back it went."
2,One fatal flaw,An otherwise great headset is ruined by one stunningly idiotic design flaw. Rotating the mic boom too far (as others have pointed out) causes the microphone to stop working - I suppose it snaps a wire or something.Not preventing the mic boom from rotating too far (by some sort of plastic stop or something) is one of the worst product flaws I've ever seen.
5,Greatest wireless headset I've seen,"This is the best bluetooth headset out there. The microphone works great in noisy environments where my regular handsfree would be loud. Battery lifetime is good, and the case is great.The blue light flashing on the side can be covered with a small sticker or small piece of tape so you won't draw attention to yourself.I have a Sony/Ericsson T610 phone and setup was easy.The features of the headset make it worth the money."
2,nice design - terrible support at Logitech,"This headset is a nice design: easy to configure, easy to fit on your ear and the adjustable boom isn't too bulky. It's coffin-looking charger is nice, too.However, the Logitech technical support is terrible. They are hard to contact, unhelpful and mean. I had this repeatedly in trying to contact them on why the mic wasn't working."
1,Poor Product Quality Control & Support,"The first Logitech Mobile Bluetooth Headset I got was DOA -- the headset would not charge. The replacement unit was defective as well -- annoying electronic tones in the earpiece, unreliable charging, and after a few days the microphone went haywire and started generating a very loud, constant buzzing/static background noise, drowning out the speaker's voice. Logitech support was non-existent. This was to be my wife's ""big"" Christmas present, but it was nothing but a big disappointment. An important footnote: Amazon handled the replacement and returns graciously and promptly, entirely at their expense -- no complaints about that!"
2,"Good design, but doesn't work with Nokia 3650","The Logitechh Mobile Bluetooth Headset has a great design and I found it easy on the ear. There was just one big problem with it for me - it didn't work with my phone, the Nokia 3650. Seems Logitech made a boo-boo and implemented the bluetooth spec really out of spec on this baby, hence the reason the headset doesn't work with the 3650.It seems like it would be a good headset otherwise (minus the annoying bright blue LED), but if you have a 3650, go with the $79.99 Jabra bluetooth headset instead (not the $69.99 one!), as it supposively works with the 3650."
2,Everyone is good except it's muted on my T616,"Well I just got my mobile Bluetooth headset. The sound quality is really good and even act as a speakerphone if you turn your phone volume up really high.You could also use it as a headset for your bluetooth enabled computer. It's only mono though. I wish they have stereo bluetooth.Overall, I would recommend a buy for this unless you find another one with stereo sound."
1,Wouldn't connect to Nokia 3650,"Another poster mentioned that it wouldn't connect to their Nokia. I had the same problem with a different phone. I have a Nokia 3650, and it would pair, but it won't connect. It's a shame, as it seems to be comfy. If you have a Nokia, I'd say stay away from this."
4,What a pleasant surprise!,"Logitech has produced a great bluetooth headset. I was able to pair the device with my SE T610 on the first try and it worked perfectly. I was a little unsure about the device at first, because there is almost no description for the headset, and no picture. Not to mention that the price is well below what some other manufacturers are charging for products that don't have the battery life or quality, but went ahead and purchased it because of another good review. I would have rated this product at five stars if the status light were a little less conspicuous (maybe not on the outside of the headset). Something about a little blue flashy light on the headset draws people's attention.PROS:--great range--great sound quality--ease of use--long battery lifeCONS:--status light on the outside of the headsetUPDATE-- the one major problem that I had with this headset was that the boom mic broke after being overextended."
3,eh...,"I really enjoy this book. It's opened my mind to many new thoughts and possibilities. BUT... I can hardly stand to read it because of all the silly gramatical errors a simple proofread would have fixed. Things like leaving the 's' out of breakfast, putting commas in the wrong place, and repeatings words such as 'to' where they shouldn't be."
5,The Best in this Field!,"I have explored and experienced the field of self-hypnosis for many years now. I have also read a vast array of books on the subject and when I bought this one I did not expect to find anything new.This book is refreshing. It has a wonderful tone to it and sets things out so easily for anyone to comprehend. I really enjoyed this and have been using the techniques within the book for a regular implementation of self-hypnosis in my life. There are many varying techniques for all manner of personal development.The Secrets of Self-Hypnosis has renewed my interest and I think anyone would truly enjoy reading this book. This is the first time I have ever written a review, this book stimulated me to do so. I thank the author for this book."
4,Burmese Phrasebook,"This is exactly the type of reference book I was looking for. Not only does the book breakdown the phonetics of Burmese in a step-by-step manner, it also is very easy to place in my pocketbook. I have used the book to help me communicate with my nanny and that in itself is a blessing. While I use the book to freshen up on my Burmese, my nanny loves perusing through it to freshen up on her English."
5,30min. of 100% pure hillarity!.....BUT IT'S ONLY 30min!!!!!,"I LOVE THIS TAPE! Unlike all the ""BLOOPER"" shows we've been subjected to in the past,This is actually funny!TO see the down to earth human side of JOEL,MIKE,TRACE,KEVIN,FRANK,etc...Is a genuine treat for all misties!For me the the best part of this tape is poor Frank Conniff,HE JUST CAN'T STOP LAUGHING!!!Could this be the reason Frank is no longer on the show?I kid of course,(WHO DOSEN'T LOVE TV'S FRANK?).Really though people this is really a great tape.It will make you laugh,""ARE WE GOING ON THREE""And it will make you cry,(JOEL,TRACE,FRANK).At 30min.it delivers but leaves you begging for more.I just hope that we will be given even more tapes like this in the not to distant future."
3,Buy smart! 'Poopie' is available on the 'Manos Hands...' DVD,"Skip this fun 30-minute scrapbook - it's included on the 'Manos, Hands of Fate' DVD. (Join my cause for helping the world save money, and making the MST3K guys work harder for our money. Together we might change the world...) Anyway, this 25-minute collection of random screwups/gaffes/and naughty improvisation is throwaway fun for established fans. No clips from the countless 'bad' movies, just various takes of 'skits' that went wrong. My favorite moments: Mike Nelson as both a stoned hippie and '80s singer/icon Morrissey, Satellite of Love setpieces falling on puppeteers, Nelson as Torgo's Pizza Delivery, etc. etc. You'd never truly need this, but if you buy the essential 'Manos Hands of Fate' DVD, this humble giggle will be included. Skip the video, buy 'Manos'. And you can spend that saved cash on beer for MST3K parties. I can't think of a better plan."
3,"Outtakes, yes--consistantly funny, no.","A mere thirty minutes long, Poopie!: Mystery Science Theater 3000 Official Outtakes Reel is honesly just about as funny as thirty minutes of those recirculated water-cooler jokes you hear at work. Granted that the first five minutes are rather funny, the other twenty-five, are nothing more than repeated attempts at the same line, which end in much the same fashion. Flubbed lines populate most of this video, but like I said, there are a few clips at offer at least some humor: sets come crashing down and robots catch, well, you'll have to buy it if you want to know that part. This video is for the die-hard Mystery Science Theater fan--not to be confused with the person who taped four episodes from television and watches them over and over and over. So those of you who put who put your record albums in the closet to make room for endless amounts of Mystery Science Theater VHS cassettes on your shelf nearest the VCR, this video, in fact, may just be for you."
2,Dissapointing,"I love Mystery Science Theater 3000, and I've watched most of the episodes. But without any introduction or notice, the outtakes begin of the cultic MST3K show. The bloopers - which you would expect to be hilarious - are stale and boring. Stick to the movies guys, and forget the blooper real. It's not worth the 30 minutes to watch."
5,Very Funny!,If you are a fan of MST3000 you need to buy this video. very funny outtakes and behind the scenes kinda stuff. You'll be happy you did!
4,you had to be there,"While an excellent video for true MSTies, I doubt that people with limited knowledge of the show would understand it. I definitely appreciated the absence of a commentator and laugh track, and the fact that Tom and Crow stay in character throughout the bloopers is hilarious. It helps to have seen the episodes from which these bloopers were pulled, since my MST-illiterate friend didn't get many of the funnies."
3,Tom Servo fell apart! HA HA!!,"A must-have for MSTies out there! Poopie will have you rolling on the floor if you ever watched the show. Crow's head is on fire, Tom's head falls off (AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!), Joel forgets his lines, Mike spaces out and Forrester and TV'S Frank blow thier lines and breaks up laughing!A good outtakes reel. I would've given it 5 stars if it were longer."
5,HI-KEEBA! It's the MST bloopers!,"If you are a hardcore MST3K fan, you will appreciate the video ""Poopie!"" Here you will get the chance to see Joel, Mike, Trace, Frank and the other S.O.L.ers at their very worst as they try to not laugh there way through the host segments. The noteable scenes from the outtake reel is Crow bletching, Tom's head falling off, and the constant use of the ""SH**"" word. It's a must have!!"
5,Great Diuretic,This tea is a great diuretic. I retain lots of water and my ankles swell. But drinking 2 or 3 cups of this tea daily has taken care of that problem for me. My hands and ankles don't swell anymore.
3,Good show,Good Nostalgia. However the band could move forward with a possibly younger more rocker looking Singer. MLS has no longer a rock image. I'm sure there are lots of great singers that would love to front this band.
3,"rock,classic","I saw these guys in 1976 at the Waukegan,Il Twin Skate Arena, 700 people tops general admission, opening for Bob Segar for $5. This is an oK archive to relive the past. I agree with the other reviewer that Michael Lee Smith might have been better to check his wardrobe at the door.Tacky showing for what was the Bret Michaels of the mid Seventies. The venue is what,60 people, still they drag thru the setlist of all their hits and leave us wandering what happened to the STARZ that we remembered?"
2,Only for fans,"I'm not a Starz Fan and i get this dvd to be introduced to the band,1- The DVD quality is lower than a bootleg, almost an amateur audience shoot, and the sound is really bad.2- The band is terrible out of shape, with a lot of mistakes during the show, specially the drummer and singer3- I will try with some of their first records because this was a total disapointent."
2,Movie I ordered Streets of Fire,"I order the DVD Streets of Fire and it will not play in my DVD player, it says out of region when I put it in the DVD, so I can not watch it on the TV. I discovered that it will play on my laptop and I am disappointed, I thought I was getting a movie to play in my DVD. I am very disatified with this movie that was sent to me. I had never heard of out the region movies."
4,cult following,"This movie is the best of campy. The actors are reminiscent of the old dragnet TV show with bad one liners. The story line is shallow but cool, the music is really very good. I love this movie."
5,Old but good!!,"I love this movie from the 80's, however not a movie the kids can watch. This came out before the PG-13 rating system. Glad to see it on DVD."
2,be careful of this item,This movie had one option.It comes in HD format only. I didn't think much of it at the time but as it turns out this is not a regular dvd and it is not a blue ray disk eithertherefore it wont play in my blueray player and it wont play in my computer either so I can't even watch this movie. The movie came with an insert tag that says go to[...] to get the latest updated firmware to play but this site is not very helpful and confusing to get around in. Can't find the download.So be aware when buying this movie!!
3,Rock and Roll Fable,"Streets of Fire is a fun film. The plot can be summed up as the reluctant hero has to rescue his old girlfriend from the more colorful villian. It has lots of action and great music. ""Nowhere Fast"" and ""Tonight is What it Means to be Young"" sound like rock anthems, in the Meatloaf style. The scenery consists of neon lit wet streets; run down diners, hotels, and trains; lots of smoke; a bit like Bladerunner. The downside is that the cool character stereotypes are only stereotypes. Amy Madigan and Willem Dafoe are very good, but everyone else seems to be overdoing it. It is filled with tough-guy speak and cliches that you will see coming a mile away. Still, it is a fun movie and I love it. Call it popcorn entertainment."
1,mixed feelings,"I love this movie but I do not understand what hd means. We have multiple dvd playrs from reg to blue ray and the movie does not play waste of money for the ""HD DVD""."
1,dvd password protected,Having received my DVD when I attempted to view same I encountered two difficulties.Firstly the I had to reset my DVD player to a different region which I have since done.However I still cannot play this DVD as when I load the disc it (the DVD disc) requests me to enter a password which I do not have/Any assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.It appears the DVD is formatted for the USA region which perhaps is the problem even though my player is set up for multi region.Best regardsBernard Glennon
4,Fun Fantasy,"This movie is fun to watch, but don't take it as true to the period. I liked the fact that the movie uses aspects of different times and music to tell a simple story of love that is never realized because of the life paths that each of the characters is on. The music is great and the action is not to bad either. You'll enjoy just sitting back with some popcorn and enjoying a movie that makes you feel good."
4,Rock Ballade,"This is a good movie. Nothing spectacular but fun to watch. A bad boy who is really good, a beautiful rock star, her promoter and bad guys and great music. This was an attempt to make a movie for the young generation of the 80's and it was quite successful. A gorgeous rock star (Diane Lane) is abducted and her ex comes to her rescue. Throw in some great music and good scenery and you got a winner. Be aware though that this was made in the 80's and it potrays the feel of that decade."
4,The good things,"The movie isn't the greatest, but it does have some good things going for it:-The music is incredible-If you're into that sort of thing, Wilem Dafoe in leather pants and looking extremely creepy.-SLEDGEHAMMER FIGHT!But for me, the real joy of the movie is Rick Moranis swearing like a sailor. Virtually every other word out of his character's mouth is an obscenity and given that most people (like me) know him only from Family type movie (Honey I shrunk the kids, etc) it's a pleasant little shock."
5,DIANE LANE shines in STREETS OF FIRE,"I loved this film as a teenager and still love it now. It is innocent rock'n'roll comic book stuff that is both stylish and entertaining. The film has notable performances by some actors who later became big stars. DIANE LANE who is now a big star thanks to her lead roles in ""The Perfect Storm"", ""Unfaithful"", ""Judge Dredd"" etc is great as Ellen Aim, and WILLEM DAFOE (SpiderMan) is the bad guy. Great DVD and VHS quality, but I'd go for the DVD if you can."
3,DVD was brand new....BUT!,I received the DVD in a timely manner and there was nothing wrong with it. It was Brand New and in a sealed package. What I didn't notice about the DVD was that it was an HD DVD that will not play in regular dvd players or blueray. You must have a HD DVD player to watch this movie. My computer wouldnt even play it because that drive also has to be HD. I wasn't about to go out and buy an HD dvd player just to watch one movie. So the dvd was useless to me and I ended up giving it away.B
4,Wonderfully Cheesy,"Do not buy this movie if you are looking for serious drama, good dialogue, character development or a plot that makes sense. Do buy this movie if you love movies that are so bad they're good. It's fun to see several actors way back when. Rick Rossovich, Bill Paxton, and Willem Defoe for example. Interesting sets and background details. Rick Moranis' clothes are hilariously awful(shield your eyes!) plaid on plaid, checks on stripes."
3,Campy Streets,I remembered this movie from when I first watched it about 20 years ago. It's interesting how your tastes change over the years. While the music is great and its fun to see the the good versus bad battle it just was not as fun to watch as I remembered it was.
5,streets of fire,loved this movie in the eighties and still love it. especially the last two songs. wish I could sing like ellen aim
5,A cult classic for a reason.,My husband enjoyed this. He said the dialog reminded him of some of the old black and white movies from the 30's. It was a fun movie to watch and Michael Pere' was very good in it.
4,A visual treat from the oral tradition.,"Gosh, this is great looking - the atmosphere, the neon, the pompadours, the cast, the bikers, the Blasters, the retro cars. The music is first rate as well. Nobody dies, there is no bloodshed (except a bloody nose from fisticuffs).As another reviewer aptly put it, the story is straight out of Greek antiquity - and it merged with a midcentury comic book. The only trouble is the lines are delivered so lamely, which is hard to imagine, given the professional cast (Walter Hill never was good at commanding dialogue from his cast in any of his movies). Also - the retro look goes strangely 1980s when the cast ends up in what must've been an MTV version of Spanish Harlem. No matter. See this. It is a good testament to the power of storytelling."
5,A Cool Rock and Roll Adventure,I don't care what anybody says Streeys of Fire is the best rock and roll movie ever. Also it has EXTREMELY EXCELLENT action scenes
3,Hear no evil...,"Surprisingly lousey sound, especially for a rock n roll ""fable.""The better your sound system, the more disappointing.Figure the songs are supposed to be the bright spots in a dead script... and you get the point."
2,ludicrous movie,"Despite the bleak, futuristic sets and the presence of Willem Dafoe, this movie is totally ridiculous. The awful soundtrack came from Jim Steinman, the same genius responsible for Meat Loaf's Bat Out of Hell. The plot and script were terrible! The dialogue was apparently written by a 3rd grader."
1,Won't play,Got this but it won't play on any player I have (Please read info before ordering) I have seen this movie a couple of times not the best of movie's but Diane Lane is hot in this and she's one of my favorites.
5,"Great movie, though still goofy after all these years!!","I like this movie for whatever reason, even though it is probably one of the goofiest movies I have ever seen. I just enjoy this movie for whatever reason and will watch it whenever on TV, or whatever. Story line is unbelievable, customs are out of this world, fair acting (you can tell the actors enjoyed making this film), but this movie just that certain ""whatever"" to it that makes me like it so much.Ordered through Amazon and had item in about 5-7 calender days. Received with no problems and price was decent enough."
2,cant play the movie,i'm not able to watch it with my dvd player it ask for a region code and i dont know how to select a region on my dvd player and i dont know the region to the movie
5,80's flashback fun,"I remembered this movie from when I was younger as being campy and fun. It is still fun, with songs by Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks, Ry Cooder... Bill Paxton is the dorky bartender, and Ed Begley Jr. shows up as a bum. Michael Pare flamed out shortly after this, but Diane Lane, Willem Dafoe and Rick Moranis went on to have pretty great careers and it's fun to see them in this crazy movie. The story is mythical, kind of an Orpheus thing, but the drama is played over the top.... oh, and Amy Madigan is in it as a soldier for hire. It was fun."
4,A great time,"I first saw this one around '87 or so, when it was out in rentals. Since then, I've watched it anytime I had the chance, and bought the video when I found it. Was amazed to find the soundtrack on CD since I couldn't even find it on tape anymore. As I've told friends who asked me about it, it can be summed up very short. ""Bad acting, cliched dialog, predictable plot, decent action, great music, awesome movie!"" This one is made for just kicking back and escaping to somewhere else for a while."
5,GREAT,The service From the this seller was great!!! I cant stress that enough. I will do business with them again.
4,A Great and Funny Entertainment,"This is a very good tale, and Walter Hill relates it with all the ""clichés"" that the story needs. Is a matter of honor. The characters are what you expect from them, the bad is really a bad guy, the anti-heroe is very stupid, the girl is a little fool, very pretty and interested in her carrer. The hero is perfect, when he travells by train, he is in the train ALONE. It's a perfect combination of music, motorcycle, leather's jackets and action, honor, blues & Rock & Roll. Enjoy it."
3,FITS OF FIRE,"Fun movie for it's day, but it doesn't hold up these days. Good soundtrack, good costumes, and pretty good acting. Rick Moranis even does a good job overacting!"
5,"Another time, another place....","I've got the DVD, I've got the VHS, I've got the soundtrack, and ,if I could find it, I'd have the poster up on my wall. I've heard people dismiss this as another 50's nostalgia movie. It ain't. Sure, there is an overall atmosphere that could be late 40's or 50's- or it could be anytime, now or a 100 years from now. This really is a rock and roll fable, because fables have a timeless, immortal quality to them. Fables also reach something deep down in you instead of skipping across the surface of your mind. I've probably seen thousands of movies since this was first realeased, yet I remember this one. I keep coming back to it when I want to feel better, when I want to feel something....I don't know, maybe this is set in rock and roll heaven- where we all get to be Tom Cody if we're good."
5,Great Cult Classic,"Love the acting, storyline and music in this movie. Makes you want to live in and be a part of the time and place that this movie depicts. It draws you in. It is appealing to women and men. Great chick flick and action movie all in one."
3,No DVD?,"I'm kinda of bummed that they don't sell this movie on a DVD so I can keep it in my collection. But I do like this movie, it brings back memories. This was the first movie I rented on VHS that I played on my new VHS hifi stereo player which sounded great. Of course now everything is in a least 5.1 surround sound and we take it for granted, but back then most everything was played in mono."
4,Flash from the past,"I had been thinking about this movie for some time, remembering how much fun it was and how beautiful Diane Lane was. It was every thing I remembered, the quality was good and the story entertaining. It had a super cast, most of whom would be recognized by everyone today."
1,I wouldn't know...,I never recieved mine. The seller screwed me over on this one. I only recieved one tin out of the set and it had jagged edges. I would not reccommend if you value your money and time.
5,Best Ever!,"I know it says this toy is for 9+ years, but I bought one for my son's 6th birthday and we love it. Of course he needed a bit of help with the building - the instructions on the computer are very impressive.The mission set up was not immediately obvious but we soon got the hang of it. We have had hours of fun going on missions.My son wants another Spybotics for Christmas so that we can go on 2 Spybotic missions. I am really looking forward to playing Spybotics on Christmas day. Someone else will have to cook Christmas lunch!I would imagine that an older child would absolutely love it. If you don't have any children buy one for yourself!"
1,Spybotics and Windows 2000,"We bought the Lego Sysbotics for my 8-year-old son for Christmas. He was very enthusiastic about it until we tried to install the software in our PC running Windows 2000 Professional (SP3). The software is not compatible and in Lego's website they have almost no information about the problem. Great disappointment for Christmas day! In the box they state that the product requires Windows 98, ME or XP but is not clear that is NOT compatible with Windows 2000.Not the usual great Lego product."
3,"Kindle Photos Too Small, But . . .","I'm basically seconding Freeman's review, but I want to say/write that I think the Kindle edition is probably still good as a reference to the katas, especially in view of the relatively low price."
1,Tomiki Aikido Response to KHPatton,"Please note my review of 1 star reflects my opinion of KHPatton's review and not of the book itself which I do not yet own.KHPatton's review of Tomiki Aikdio Free Fighting Method and Koryu Aikido by Nobuyoshi Higashi is totally false. Sensei Higashi's technique's are clear and precise. KHPatton's assertion that Higashi Sensei wrote the book for a ""quick buck"" is shameless and dishonorable since Higashi Sensei has totally dedicated his life to the propogation of the martial arts in the US. Frankly, I have yet to meet an author of a martial arts book that has been able to retire on his/her earnings. If Mr. KHPatton could offer write a better book on Tomiki Aikido than I invite him to do so. If not, kindly keep your ignorant remarks to yourself and respect the sensei's that have worked deligently to impart their knowledge on all students including ungrateful ones such as yourself."
5,Not everyones cup of tea. But wonderful nevertheless.,"This is one of the best movies in its category. This is the true story of Ghandi and the role he played in freeing India from the British occupation. Both picture and sound are wonderful.This is a three hours movie. The pace is slow at times and fast at other times. This is not something to watch while you are reading the paper. This is a movie that requires the viewer to be in the correct frame of mind before begining to view it. Set aside sometime to watch it, and you will not be disappointed.I must have watched this movie 10 times already, it is that good. The special features are excellent and there are some newsreels of Gandhi himself.I throughly enjoyed the movie and the DVD and I highly recommend the movie to all people."
5,Ghandi DVD,What a great movie for those that missed it back when. Having visitedIndia recently (a should do for all at some point in life) it had a very special meaning for me. Mandella learned from Ghandi.
5,Gandhi a spiritual journey,"I remember when the movie first came out. It left a lasting impression on me. This movie is a timeless lesson on world views regarding politics,as well as social, and spritual tasks ahead of us.It reminds one of how we are all connected. It demonstrates how one visionary can change a society for the benefit of all.I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning more about the journey of the human condition.Maria Brullo"
5,Ordinary man - extraordinary determination,"A must-see for everyone. Richard Attenborough has captured the fierce determination of Gandhi in showing the world a new way of non-violence. At a personal level, it is a story of austerity, self sacrifice and tremendous courage against daunting odds.I wish however that the film had covered Gandhi's early struggles in England and South Africa in greater detail. I truly believe that Sir Richard Attenborough can make another movie covering only those early years of Gandhi and it would turn out to be just as remarkable."
3,A DVD SPECIAL EDITION OF GANDHI WITHOUT THE HINDI LANGUAGE TRACK???!!!,"I gave the film 3 stars because the movie is a SUPERB DRAMA but Gandhi deserves more than this on dvd!This is not just a normal biography film or intense social criticism, THIS MOVIE WAS MEANT TO BE SEEN BY THE ENTIRE WORLD! EVERYBODY HAVE TO WATCH THIS FILM!!!This movie must be VERY SPECIAL to India, so I think that the Hindi language track is very important because we would realize how this movie came to the entire world, how special it is to India and how the characters expressed themselves in their original language.The dvd should also put features of how the people of India think of this film and how Gandhi's ideas helped the people in the future.Adios."
5,Must watch movie!,"Excellent movie; a real masterpiece collection.The life of Mahatma Gandhi - the dialogues are very well written, thoughtful and inspiring. One must watch this movie to learn how to be clam in the time of great turmoil and unstability."
3,Better on Blu-Ray,"Ok on DVD but better on Blu-Ray. Time to upgrade to the new stuff, good thing I did. I recommend the same to all of you."
5,My Favorite Movie of All Time,"This movie is simply my all-time favorite movie.When I sometimes feel depressed about the world or life, I will watch this movie, and it always manages to make me feel better. Gandhi's life was so powerful, and his motives were so pure and unblemished by personal greed or gain, that it fills my whole being with a deep warmth and true happiness to be reminded that sometimes we humans are capable of such greatness.Perhaps there are better movies to watch for entertainment, but I would suggest that no movie beats this one for portraying the best we can aspire to, and that is a very good thing."
5,Important Movie about an Important Man,"The life of Gahndi should not be forgotten. The acting in this movie is perfect and the messege and life of Gahndi comes through strong and clear in this brilliant piece of cinema magic.This movie should be played in every school. Every man, woman and child should see this movie."
5,Great Film,"Excellent film with great performance, as always, by Kingsley. The dvd extras are very good and illuminating. Highly recommend."
5,Begins to give the West an understanding of Gandi,"Gandi is grossly misunderstood by most Western people, and is not appreciated for the depth of his personal achievements. This film does a great service in beginning to introduce him to the West.To be honest, even this epic movie doesn't capture the most important part of his life. It concentrates mostly on the political events and under-emphasises the personal transformation he went through. I recommend you check out ""Gandi the Man"" by Eknath Easwaran... (ISBN: 0915132974)."
5,Ghandi's Life,"Excelent Movie, well done, good acting, Ben Kingsley best performance ever... Moving ans inspiring story, I recommend it without hesitation.."
5,Gandih,"I had not seen this movie since it first came out and it is still a superb movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone. As a child, I can recall news articles about Gandih. But like most of us, as a child things going on around you don't actually sink in. But this movie re-awakened a very important part of world history for me."
5,An Historical Epic,"This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Ben Kingsley was the perfect fit to play the legendary Gandhi in this brilliantly produced epic showing the struggle for freedom from imperialism and the resultant emergence of an independent India and Pakistan. This is history in its finest! The only negative side to this movie is Candice Bergen was the wrong person cast for the role of Margaret Bourke-White.I was also impressed with the bonus CD in which Richard Attenborough and his production team go to great lengths in showing us how the movie was created, including the stunning 'state funeral' of Gandhi that was actually filmed on the very anniversary of his death, and with a claimed record crowd scene of almost half a million people."
5,Excellent Value for Your Entertainment Dollar,"Superlative packaging, production, directing, acting, screenplay, and story. You can't ask for more for home entertainment - especially if you have HD and widescreen Dolby 5.1 sound!"
1,DVD Rating and not the movie rating,"I was totally disappointed with the DVD. ""Gandhi"" is one of my favorite movies. But I was so much disappointed with the DVD that I almost disowned it. It does not have audio or subtitles in Hindi or any other Indian language. Gandhi was a Gujarati (mother tongue: Gujarati) and an Indian (Language: Hindi). The DVD has all sorts of subtitles and languages but does not have any language for Indians. I think the producers of the DVD owed this much to the very Mahatma - and his fellow countrymen - whose life has been depicted in the movie. Such products should not be simply weighed on money and how much revenue the sales would generate. Corporations owe something grander than that."
1,Historically inaccurate,"Before i begin i must profess that i am from Pakistan. The low rating of this review is not based on that fact. I have the utmost respect for Mr. Gandhi; he was a very noble man indeed and did not allow the question of ethnicity or ideology hinder his preachings. In this movie ""Gandhi""; Mr. Jinnah has been incorrectly protrayed as an irresponsible; shabbily attired confused leader. Hardly the characteristic of a leader who created a nation without firing a bullet. It is a well documented fact that Mr. Jinnah was an impressionable speaker and immaculate in his attire. In his dealings Mr. Jinnah is known to be very noble and just.Richard Attenborough does immense injustice to this fact and in doing so does a great dis-service in setting an unbiased and impartial portryal of characters of the time. It is to this fact and this fact alone i give this DVD a low score."
1,Imperfect disk,"This film earned Oscars, as did Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, but I'm frustrated with the copy I received; it comes on 2 DVDs, and try as I might, there is no way I can access the movie on the 2nd disk. The movie does NOT end at the end of the 1st disk. I clicked on everything that was clickable, but nowhere did I see ""Movie"" or ""Play movie"" to click on; only on all the extras, which I clicked too, in case one would lead me to ""Play movie"". No luck. Am disgusted. That's why I gave it only one star. Otherwise, it deserves 5. Hope you have better luck.Subtitles are available."
1,The worste I've ever seen,"This movie is one of the biggest examples of how movies in general can slaughter the events that they are based on. This movie was not made as any tribute, so matter what anyone says. This movie was made to MAKE $$$$$$. That's all."
4,Wow,"I'm a member of WBGO -- the NPR-Jazz station around NYC/NJ, and I'd just bought their 25th-Anniversary compliation of what they hailed to be 30 of the greatest tracks from Verve and Blue Note Records. I'd not listened to all of it yet, but figured that this would be good listening as I worked out. I put the second CD and started pedaling, when Night Rider came on. I had to stop and just listen. It was about the most amazing jazz tune I'd heard in awhile -- a virtuousic saxophone sailing amongst a turbulent sea of strings. After listening to that one song, I had to get the album."
5,Focus,"I was turned on this album back in the sixties when it was first released. I couldn't get enough of it. During the sixties it was stolen along with some other great albums I have not been able to replace. Luckily, the album was remastered a some point, and I have the cassete and now the CD and still love it as much as I did forty years ago."
2,2.5 Stars: Disappointing,"I hate to be a wet blanket thrown over very warm reviews here, but this album doesn't do much for me. It lacks the bounce and giddiness of the Jazz Samba album, the collaborative briliance of Getz/Gilberto, and the energy of Captain Marvel--all albums that I have listened to repeatedly. This one, however, I have played only 2 or 3 times. What does it sound like? It is Getz playing mostly to string accompaniment. One could call this Getz's ""Sketches of Spain"" album. It sounds a bit like Getz playing a musical score for a film that you are not watching. For me, the melodies--Getz's strong point--just aren't here. It is an earnest effort, to be sure, but it felt too much like noodling."
1,Sweet muzak.,"Don't buy it, it's some of the most boring and pretentious jazz-muzak I ever heard.If you want a really good jazz-classical combination I recommend the swedish baritone-sax player Lars Gullins ""Portrait of my pals"" 1964. Unfortunately, not yet available on this site."
5,Alto Sax Clinic,"Johnny Hodges is so good he sets the standard for big band saxophonists, literally holding a clinic on how to play the blues. With Duke Ellington, ""Sweets"" Edison and others to back him, this late 50's recording is hard to beat. Another recording from the same period with the nearly the same personell is ""Side by Side"". Own both!"
4,A very well behaved CD,"This is a delightful outing featuring Ellington and Hodges in a small group playing some blues standards. Not terribly exciting, important or innovative, but has nice recording quality, nice relaxed playing, very enjoyable to listen to. Not a bad track on the whole CD. I recommend it.My star rating scale.* A really worthless CD** A CD that has some good stuff, but some major defects.*** An OK CD that will please fans of the artist in question.**** An excellent CD that represents the best work of the artist in question and can be bought with confidence.***** An absolute classic that is the best, or among the best, of its genre. Your collection should start here."
4,Pure & Honest,"Tony Brook has been impressing audiences in and around the south-east for the better part of a decade. This early release captures some of his best early song-writing with jems like ""Christine"" and the absolutely beautiful ballad ""Atchafalya"".There is nothing contrived in Brook's music or lyrics. He can make you laugh with absurdity (a la ""Jelly Jam"" & ""Day of Rest"") or damn near commit to hermit-living with the occasional earnest ballad. Through it all, you hear honest humor, honest emmotion, and a whole lotta good.As far as musicianship is concerned, the album does not suffer. Considering Brook's extensive catalogue, the choice of cuts can leave you wanting for a few more ; especially considering his nack for gut-wrenching country balladry."
5,"great product, free shipping","I love this scoreboard, definitely worth the investment... i coach basketball and see other coaches using the cheap scoreboards where the numbers flap around when it gets windy... buy this product, you get free shipping too..."
2,Nice Breast! (if you can get the top off),she's very stiff and her legs fall off if you pic her up. pic through her gown and her nipples are very detailed;)perv.lol
2,Don't bother....,"Although this unit is a space saver, we are disappointed in the consistency of the temperature. It gets cold fairly quickly, but then freezes your drink. Definitely don't leave anything in there overnight or it will be a block of ice in the morning. We tried calling Hamilton Beach, however after a 17 minute wait to connect to a customer service rep the line went dead. When we called back it was another 21 minutes to connect to someone. Another bad point is that you can't adjust the temperature - there is no temperature control - there is a switch on the back for warm off cold. That's it. One last note, the latch on the door is quite cheap. Overall I'd give this a ""D""."
3,It worked great for a year.,This was a nice little product. It did the job in my office (keeping my lunch cold)quietly for about a year. Then it got loud. VERY loud. It still worked but the noise was awful. I tried taking off the back and cleaning/inspecting the motor. Nothing helped. I donated it to charity.
2,"Agree with ""Not worth the price!, June 9, 2005""",The fan motor is making vibrating and whirring noises. It appears that this product has not been designed to run continously for months as the fan/fan bearings must wear out and the product is not even a year old. I was very happy with the product until this problem appeared.
5,Trust with the mind not only the heart,"This book is so good. It shows that beuty dosent always get you where you want to go. Trusting people are the ones who always get hurt the most in the end. Somehow we all must figure out what is best for us as we grow up. Not only for us but for our loved ones close to us. Beuty and brains are good but what comes from inside is the one that counts. This book is a perfect example and a good book for everyone to read. It really moved me in all kinds of way. Dont wait, READ IT!"
1,Like shooting a porno in the Vatican,"I just watched the first 20 minutes of this movie in awe: while the first two movies broadened my view of the world and society, this one made me want to shoot the director.This movie was not directed by the genius who directed the first two, Jamie Uys, but by some uncreative, incompetent and completely tasteless Hong Kong director named Billy Chan. I find it immoral that the producers corrupted N!xau into making the piece of excrement that this film is.This movie is aimed at brain-dead individuals who thought the first two movies were only just funny, when in actual fact they are meant to deliver a deep philosophical message. I guess Billy Chan didn't quite understand the first two movies, or he was merely interested in making a few bucks off the momentum of the previous two.The previous 5-star review is utter deceptive nonsense."
3,Fewer laughs,Not as funny as the first one since the story lacked depth comedy or not. Yet still good for a few laughs.
1,very bad,"After i order the filter .I have to wait 2 week to get the filter .And i open it ,the filter look like old .no box just cover the newspaper .I very don't like it."
3,not hoover brand,"this is not a hoover brand item, it's like a generic brand not sure, but also not as durable, might as well buy the higher price one in the store, it will last longer"
1,"""Hoover"" hepa filter","This was advertised as a Hoover 40140201, however it was a no-name replacement! I resent being deceived. The price was too good to be true. If a brand name is pictured, that is what should be shipped, not a no-name product of inferior quality. I will never use this service again. Caveat emptor."
5,Hoover WindTunnel Replacement Filter,"I received a Hoover Factory Replacement HEPA Filter from Allergy Be Gone, well packaged, in less than a week as advertised. Good price and good service. What more can you ask for!"
5,Hoover HEPA Cartridge Filter A Bargain,This replacement cartridge is the same as the original Hoover filter. It is a bargain of at least 50% savings through Amazon versus purchasing it at a retail department store.
4,Doesnt fit 100%,"Its the exact same filter I had on my vaccum, but when you 'spin' the filter to remove the dust off of it, it doesnt hit the piece that nocks off the dust. Im not sure if its just a fluke, but I still plan on buying from this store!"
5,good,"the price was really good almost 2 time cheaper then on official site Hoover, until now I used just one time so I hope it's gonna hold."
1,product misrepresented,I feel duped after purchasing this product based upon the Amazon description. I was under the impression that I was buying a Hoover brand product at a great price. I was wrong. The product is some cheaper quality knock off. I guess I have learned once again that I get what I pay for.
2,Hoover replacement filter,This product was not a Hoover genuine filter as advertised. The filter is not near as sturdy as my old Hoover filter.
1,Not as advertised.,"Sadly I didn't read all the reviews first, just looked at the rating. This company is not shipping what is advertised. They are sending out generic filters that aren't even HEPA compliant. They aren't even Hoover, there is no brand name on them, no patent numbers (they may be even using patents illegally). That said they are filters, even if they are far thinner than the brand name ones, and you can see right through them. Just don't expect them to do a great job stopping dust and mites."
1,Not Hoover Product Picture is a lie,These are not Hoover filters as advertised. They come in a bag with newspaper around them with no protection. Mine are bent. These are generic (who knows if they work) garbage. I will attempt to return. Amazon should remove this seller and relegate them to eBay where you can be assured to be ripped off. If you sell a generic item STATE THIS. Some people are happy with that. I am not. At least buy and resell fake filters with Hoover stamped on them. Then maybe people like me might be duped into thinking this is the real thing. Shipping took forever. Well over 2 weeks and vendor lied about shipping date. Completely unhappy and I have only had this problem with one other 3rd party vendor on Amazon. This vendor borders on fraud.
1,B&M Housewares should be thrown off Amazon,"I tried not to believe some of these reviews. After all, the picture shows a Hoover Brand package, the Title says Hoover Long Life Replacement BY HOOVER, the product number is Hoover's number AND the list price is the Hoover list price. So why did they send me a generic cartridge in a different package that says ""Designed to fit Hoover"" - Because they are deceptive ""bait and switch"" leeches that don't deserve to carry the Amazon name. Shame on B&M and shame on Amazon...whether or not the product meets my satisfaction - this flagrant practice must not go unpunished. Customers who purchased these misadvertised products should not rate them with anything but a 1, even if the product is decent, because they are misrepresenting their products and prospective customers are being misled into buying a lesser quality product. I give them an F."
1,Hoover ? 40140201 filter from B&M Housewares.,"I ordered and paid for a Hoover replacement filter for my vacuum and recieved a GENERIC, DAMAGED filter! Plus it took a week and a half to get it! B&M Housewares SUCK!"
1,Poor Packaging,the picture shown for this product does not reflect what you receive. the filter was in a plastic bag that was wrapped in newspaper then placed in a shipping plastic bag. I received the item in the mail and it was crushed. The company selling this product is fortunate that people like myself are too lazy to repackage and return the item. It's such a hassle. I'll never purchase from this company again.
1,False advertisment!,"I searched for, found, and ordered a Hoover quality filter. In returned I received a cheap, unwrapped, generic filter with a poor quality filter media. Furthermore, the filter was wrapped in an arabic newspaper. This is the ultimate bait & switch. I will never order from this company and again and would encourage Amazon to remove them from their site."
2,want a satisfied customer?? advertise like you'd want one...,"wow, i have purchased this product from a more reputable seller in the past (from amazon mind you) and b/c that particular seller is no longer available with amazon, i chose to be sold by this company and product..yes, price was a huge factor. you always take a risk when purchasing from an unknown source but i always bank (will review my process in the future) with retailers advertising with amazon. BS product, certainly not hoover, which i wasnt necessarily banking on (i understand and believe that it does not have to be OEM). this company certainly mis represented their product as hoover and in fact is not even close... product even smells of terrible chemicals apparently used to process the filter. a filter smelling of processed chemicals...how very ironic. so very disappointed. shame on us consumers who purchase based on scam marketing. im disappointed in myself and certainly with the misreprestation of the product."
3,Product as described but shipping cost was OUTRAGEOUS,"The filter works just fine and was exactly as described. However super saver shipping was not an option when I was purchasing and I paid almost $7.00 for an item it cost them less then $3.00 to ship. For this reason, I will look elsewhere next time I need a replacement filter."
1,"Not a 3/Pack, but good service","Note: it is listed as 3/Pack, but it is just one filter. I reported it to customer support, and they quickly said they will fix the description and took care of my problem. (I tried to correct from 1 to 3 stars but couldn't change stars...)"
3,Not a genuine Hoover product (picture deceiving),"Although the picture shows a genuine Hoover filter, I received a generic filter, which was not up to my expectations."
4,Great price good product.,The price was less than half the price as in my local retailer so I purchased 4 of these. They work pretty well. The only complaint is that they did not come packaged like the picture but instead placed in a plastic mailer unpackaged. Two of the filters were a little crushed on one side but was able to get them re-shaped.
4,Fine Filter,"This filter is fine for what it is. The quality of the unit seems to match what Hoover original parts would be like. It definitely is a generic brand and the picture in the listing makes it look like a real Hoover as does the fact that it says 'Hoover' in the description. It came in a clear, no label package. Nothing is written on the plastic top either.Not sure what makes it 'long life' or 'HEPA' compliant.Shipper sent it fast and I'm sure it will filter dust just fine. Much less expensive than an original hoover stamped filter."
5,excellent,"Wal-mart carries the same product, but its more expensive. It is cheaper getting thru this site then any place else. I highly recommend theh product. I have purchased it here before several times, making it more possible to change the filter more often to get the maximum benifits of your vaccum."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this and was very disappointed in how flimsy it was. I can easily bend it. Do not buy. Pay a little extra to get a more sturdy license plate, maybe one made of hard plastic."
1,Abridged edition with very poor quality audio sound track,"This is a very poor quality audio which has been abridged to leave out some of the best parts of the play. It leaves out half of the first act, including John of Gaunt's famous ""this septer'd isle..this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England"". Richard II whines throughout, and Henry IV hardly exists. Find another audio."
1,A good example of why some people don't like Shakespeare.,"This is in reguard to the Durkin-Hayes recording. How the actors and director could ever believe they were doing justice to Shakespeare is beyond me. A play that should run at most two and a half hours unabridged, is drug out to a laborious 3 hour cut-and-slash abridgement. The halting monotone quality of the actors speech is, to say the least, tedious. Maybe there are some worthwhile moments on the second tape, but I couldn't make it past the first. For my own part this recording was a huge waste of money."
1,Audio quality poor: very noisy. Abridged Edition. Omits Much,"This abridged edition leaves out many of the most famous passages in this wonderful play. Also, the quality of the sound is very poor. I have bought all the other audio Shakespeare. This is the worst and not worth buying."
1,Would never have read this play by choice,"Richard II is most likely Shakespeare's dullest and most obscured play. Of course, this is only the perspective of a sixteen year old student. It does seem however to be a common trend among many of the readers. This was just one of six required summer readings for my Advance Placement Literature course, and let me just state that under no other circumstances would I have read this book. And to tell you the truth, I didn't read the book. I purchased the audio cassette from ""Amazon.com."" After completing the tape for a second time, and only understanding a few words, I decided to get my hands on the book itself. The only difference that I could notice was my ability to distinguish who was saying what. I do not recommend this book to anyone without a Ph. D. Even to all of you literary geniuses, good luck! You will certainly need it to stay awake. I hope I was able to deliver a delightful and ever so typical sixteen year old's response."
3,Playing with Power,"The first of the bard's great Henry tetrology does not have the power or greatness of the its titular character to the extent that the latter plays have, but it still contains some of Shakespeare's greatest soliloquies. Richard II orates famously:Of comfort no man speak:Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyesWrite sorrow on the bosom of the earth;Let's choose executors and talk of wills:And yet not so -- for what can we bequeathSave our deposed bodies to the ground?Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke's,And nothing can we call our own but death,And that small model of the barren earthWhich serves as paste and cover to our bones.Richard the II is a tragedy about folly, about the farce of monarchical politics. It is clearly ahead of its time, though it falls short of the philosophical depth that Shakespeare would reach in such masterpieces as Hamlet and Macbeth. An indispensable part of the canon all the same."
4,"Moody, atmospheric story of sugar cane planters in Australia","A tragic story steeped in the steamy atmosphere of Australian sugar cane plantations. An exotic take on an exotic time and place, 19th-century northern Australia, newly-peopled with European immigrants. Here, the Graus, who are Spanish, mingle with the Irish and the aborigines, making for some fascinating cultural encounters. Slightly reminiscent of Durrell's Alexandria Quartet. A recommended read!"
5,A tender look at sideshow attractions,"It is easy to assume that this book is going to be a kind of titillating exploitative look at freaks, but that is not what it is at all. Mannix draws from his extensive carnie experience to create a tender and even sweet look at people who were not like others around them. Mannix is clearly fueled by anger that political correctness has deprived these people of their means of earning a living and forced them into institutions. It is a way of thinking that I had not encountered before this book. He covers giants, midgets, people with parasitic twins, hermaphrodites, fat people, wild people and many others-- telling stories and anecdotes of his time on the road. Well worth the time."
5,Freakmo,This is a very good book for the lover of oddities out there. I especially love the photos and the stories of these people. Very god book!! I recomend anyone interested in oddities to pick thsi gem up. There are many wonderful pictures. I am a huge fan of Jo-Jo The dog Faced boy.
1,Innaccurate,I absolutely HATE it when authors release books without doing their homework. If i'm going to read a book based on fact I don't want any inaccuracies. This author should be ashamed of himself and if I had it my way he would be banned from writing any further books. There is no excuse for this. ABSOLUTELY NONE. You know I really should go into writing books that authors put out that corrects their factual errors maybe then there would be some sort of penalty in exposing them for their incompetence.
2,book damaged,I will need to return this copy because the cover is torn or cracked away from the pages.I believe these books are poorly made from the start. The copy I owned before I saw thiscopy has the same damage.
3,fun for fantasy,Rowan and the ice creepers is filled with magical mystery and fantastic fantasy. In this admiring adventure Rowan and his freinds follow a prophecy. the prophecy is the only clue to stop the ice creepers from destroying the the city of rin. this book was okay in my oppinion. I would recommend this book for fictional friends.
5,Simply a masterpiece,"This is a masterpiece in the entire jazz history. I own an old copy and would reccomend this album to anyone who loves jazz. even to people who do not dig too much into this music.My question is,: ""When will the Verve people release a new version on CD? ' I really hope that one of the Verve producers will answer my question simply, by just putting this mastepiece on he market again. I know at least fifty people who would buy this Cd right away, if it were availeable."
4,Now Available again in the Jazz in Paris Series,"This outstanding album, long available only in a very expensive Japanese edition, is now in print again in Universal Gitanes's ""Jazz in Paris"" series (984-635-8). Only drawback: The three bonus tracks, recorded at a different session in 1957 and issued with the original by Verve on cd in 1991 and in Japan in 2003, are not on this version, which reissues only the eight tracks from the original album recorded in Paris. But what an album! Stitt was in top form, and O.P. was the man to match him. Some great music"
4,amazing,I'm a beginner at wearing eyelashes and this glue does the trick. I accidently fell asleep with my lashes on and they stayed on throughout the night. The glue hold really well
5,just great,"I really loved this product. It is so much better than the other ones. Yay, I am so happy and satisfied."
2,Not what I expected,"I had high expectations seeing that this was one of the most revered eyelash glues out there but this was a huge disappointment. I received it today, and the shipping was so quick--a week before it was expected. The glue, however, was watery and no matter how long I waited it would not become tacky and adhere properly:( Other lash glues I've tried have worked fine, so I think I'll stick to those brands and not buy this again."
3,duo,i think im ready to use this product. ive been having it for like a month already. i was just scared. whatever happens happens (:
2,Duo OK not great,"A good product since it keeps eyelashes on longer than other glues, however, it somewhat burns upon application."
2,Frustrated,"I was very excited to receive my eyelash adhesive. However, the glue did not work at all like I expected. It just didn't seem to get tacky enough to keep the lashes properly stuck to my lash line. They kept sliding off and the ends wouldn't stay on very well. I was told that this is one of the best brands of adhesive out there, but I'm still not very pleased with my experience. As far as the shipping goes, it was great. Quick and easy!"
1,do not purchase!,"We got this product for our 3 and 7 year olds for Xmas. Not less than 3 months later, the product is broken. The metal part that shreds the ice was shredding itself - so parts of metal were found in my children's icee. Dangerous! Will not buy this product again and would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,"Kids love it, but be ready to do serious cranking","My son got this for his birthday about a year ago. He was then 6 and my older son 8. They both loved it. It will make a sno cone, but as the other reviews said, an adult must be there and willing to do the cranking. I don't mind to do this for a while, but my kids can eat a lot of sno cones! So, it got old for me quick. I keep it hidden now and get it out when I feel like cranking out sno cones. It is cute. We didn't have too many problems with assembly. I don't like the cardboard pieces that you use as scenary on the machine. They fall off when you crank and my son gets upset and wants them on there. Plus, they are cardboard and you working with ice, which turns to water--which is I why I could only give four stars for durability."
5,SpongeBob fun,This is a great toy for kids and teenagers. The snowcone maker makes a great Christmas gift for everyone on your list!
1,difficult!,"My daughter, who just turned six, received this for her bd. We (meaning me rather than her) have used it once and I'd be happy to quietly get rid of it and never use it again. We put ice cubes in, first of all, which took ages to grind up (Mom did all the work). So then we put in ""crushed ice"" from the freezer, and that took slightly less time to grind. Still, from start to finish, it took I don't know how long to make one sno-cone. I doubt we'll be using this sno-cone maker ever again -- it's just not worth the effort.="
4,great toy,"yes, the handle is a bit hard to crank for a younger child and an adult will need to help some, but that is half the fun! my boys love this...and they especially enjoy making sno-cones for the other if one of them is sick!"
2,I threw it away,"My 4 year old got this for a birthday gift. Cute, but she couldn't work it, so I had to. It is very tiring; you will have to crank for quite awhile to make one snowcone. If you have several kids you will go crazy tring to make them snocones. I ended up throwing ours away b/c it was such a hassle. My daughter never noticed. FYI - there are only a couple of paper cups in the box, and only a small amount of ""flavoring"", so you will have to make or buy more."
5,kids love it,grandson makes a cone everyday.. he has fun makinh sno-cones for everyone.. easy to use and easy to clean.. perfect for small kids
4,Very good,"The price was great, the cranking is kind of hard for my children to do (6 & 3) but it is very cool gift."
1,Everyone loves sponge bob but get ready to crank,For my four year old's birthday I bought him the sponge bob sno cone maker. I was happy with the durability but not a good sno cone maker. You crank and crank for a litle bit of ice powder. I suggest getting an electric sno cone maker.
5,Best snow cones!,"My name is Oscar and I am 7 years old. I just bought this with my own money. This is the best toy ever. The snow cone is the best snow cone I have ever tasted. You should buy this snow cone maker. The syrup tastes awesome. It was a little hard to turn the handle, but it was worth it."
5,It's a hit!,This was a birthday gift for my 5 year old grandson. He loves it andhe loves the snowcones it makes. It works pretty well with an adult doing the cranking and smaller ice cubes. My two year old granddaughter loves the snow cones too. The nostalgia value alone was worth the price-Spongebob was updated from the perenial favorite of Snoopy. I bought the Spongebob Dixie cups at the grocery store and premade the syrup so we were ready to roll on his birthday. It's a hit!
3,taste good but not easy,the ice maker would only be good for older kids because you have to crush the ice and push on the hat you probally think it would be easier if your about 10 or 11 i would not suggest this for kids under 6
4,Spongebob Fun,"Great fun for kids and easy to use, and having one of the most popular cartoon characters ever is a plus."
3,Too Expensive,"Come on folks, I bought this at K Mart for $5.99 last Christmas. The toy is fun but a small child could not do this on their own. It takes alot to grind one cup of ice, not to mention the sharpness of the grater."
1,baaaad,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The Florida newspapers who have given it positive notice are all standing up for a colleague. Beware! This is no Hiaasen! It is impenetrable, obvious and not at all funny...I bet the other reviews by ""readers"" here are publicity people."
4,Zany and fun satire,"This book with its wild antics of the Florida legislature is especially appropriate now since the entire country has watched Florida politics at work in the presidential election. It's a quick, fun read, and gets more and more outrageous as you go along."
1,Poor Hiaasen Imitation,"Date's certainly got the amorality of Tallahassee politics captured here, but frankly his big-government-should-control-every-aspect-of-your-behavior politics is what ruins this book. Hiaasen's novels make it clear that BOTH sides, all sides of politics are immoral. Date's attempt to hijack the Hiaasen style for a narrow political purpose make this novel not art, but propaganda. Moreover, I didn't even laugh once. If you or I had written this, instead of a well-connected reporter, it would never have been printed--and shouldn't have been."
2,Almost awesome.,"It was shipped and arrived in about 2 days. The irons are great, but i'm missing Santa. So I only received 5 out of 6 irons. considering the time of year - it is kind of nice to have a Santa iron..."
5,"Arrive, forewarn, and prepare...","Surviving a graceful extinction, the two remaining Mri are kept alive in the labs of human scientists and protected from Regul - for now.The Regul have destroyed all that remains of the Mri base on Kesrith, and look to exterminate them completely.With a great weight of guilt for betraying what he knows Melein & Niun's wishes must be, Duncan is sent with the Mri and two Dusei to pilot their return to the origin of all Mri life: their ancient homeworld.Dangerously quartered with them, Duncan must come to some uneasy arrangement, and it seems that nothing will do but that he renounces his humanity and becomes absorbed by the Kel.Trailed by human warships bent on discovering the extent of the Mri threat, and by Regul ship also, it is a race against time to arrive, forewarn, and prepare.As the trail of dead planets begin to streak past, all begin to fear for what will remain in the cradle of Mri civilization: Kutath.kotori ojadis@yahoo.com"
3,Good deal if on sale and you don't mind Yellow,"I'm a guy and Colonial white doesn't mean anything to me. The picture was white so I figured it would be white. Well, let me tell you, Colonial White is a brownish-yellow. If you don't care about having a brownish-yellow cover on your propane tanks and the price is cheap then this is the cover for you. If you want a white cover to match 95% of the campers out there then you better pay the extra money and get what you want. It seems well constructed and has a real handy opening in the top to turn the tanks on-off, but it is brownish-yellow. I hope this helps in your decision."
4,"Nice item, but color is off.","Item is everything it is described to be, however, the color is difinitely an ""off"" white. The cover also had very slight scuffs.Otherwise very satisfied, especially considering the price."
3,Camco Colonial White RV propane tank cover,Well made product. The colonial white is not a very pleasant color. Photos for this product make it appear to be a shade of tan and don't represent the actual color which is an ugly shade of yellow. I would not buy this color again and wish I had selected the white color instead.
1,Amazon Product Description is Wrong,"I have tried to get them to correct it but they haven't. The IC-100A does not include the 1/4"" compression fittings which were included with the older, discontinued IC-100 product. The fittings are available in a separate kit which must be ordered from a third party. As much as I am a big fan of Amazon this has become an annoyance because they just don't do their homework. You'd be better off going to your local hardware store to get the correct product."
3,Amazon rocks!,This filter comes with male inserts so it won't fit my RO water filter system but meant to be for ice maker system only. I ordered the wrong filter but Amazon is kind enough to give me a full refund (No question asked) while letting me keep the product. Amazon rocks! A true customer service oriented company.
2,Adaptor broke on installation,"While installing this icemaker water filter, one of the [optional] adaptors for compression nut ends snapped clean off. Now I must call customer service to see what can be done. Needless to say, I'm not pleased with the quality of this product."
1,Cheap plastic parts,"I bought a two-pack for my Sub-Zero refrigerator. The older water filters used to come with brass nuts on each end but these new ones come with plastic ones. I over tightened and cracked the first one. This is probably my fault but would not have happened with brass nuts. Luckily, they come in pairs, so I installed the second filter without any problems. Next time, If I have a choice, I will choose a filter that is made with quality parts."
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,"Long life, very reasonable price, and makes a noticable difference in the flavor of the ice. What's not to like?"
2,No need to buy this kit with the new MG Ver Ka coming out!,"Bottom line, this version of the Epyon kit was ok for it's time...because no other version was available, but with the recent resurgence in interest in Gundam Wing and it's model kits, Bandai is releasing a Hajime Katoki refresh of the Gundam Wing and Endless Waltz MS designs in the form of brand new MG 1/100 kits. The latest to be announced at the 2011 Shizuoka Hobby Show is the new Ver Ka Gundam Epyon MG 1/100 kit.So basically skip this one and wait for the Ver Ka kit to come out because it will be far better and a more fun build."
1,hamster wheel,"Had to bend back into alinement when it arrived. Worked great for about two days and then started to produce the worst squeaking I have ever heard, worse then nails on a chalkboard. I put some olive oil on the problem spot and that worked for another two days but then the noise returned! I would recommend spending the extra green and get a nice wheel."
5,This is a high quality heated mattress pad,I like this Sunbeam heated mattress pad. It is a particularly good solution for couples who like different heat levels.
3,worked only 1 year,When it works - it's great! I have bought 2 of these mattress pads and neither one lasted more than a year. Yes i use my side nearly every night. only my side is failing (my husband rarely turns his side on). I just bought another brand -we'll see how long that one lasts. I will be certain to complete the warranty card and keep all receipts!
5,A handy book for the amateur remodeler. . .,"The book performed as expected . . . .that is why I bought it. Theses books are designed to help the average person with a skill set needed to perform a necessary task. I read several great ideas and tips remodeling my bathroom - from installing a toilet bowel, sink and tub, to laying the tile and electrical. Recommended!"
3,really not much help,I have been reading this book for a while now as we have gutted our bathroom and for some odd reason it does not tell you how to seat a tub. which is the one and only reason I bought it. waste of money for me. I gave it three stars as I am sure there might be some helpful info in this book for someone just not me
1,I'm not doing it myself,"This book assumes that I'm going to do it myself. I expected information about what I need to know to hire someone because that's what the description says. Instead, I got a book detailing exactly how to install a faucet, lay a floor and so on. If I had any intention of doing it myself, this book might be useful. However, if I was going to do it myself, I would probably find this book to be too basic. I own far too many books about renovating my house and this one was the worst for me."
5,From Kristine Wilson,"Hebrew slave baby, prince of Egypt, wandering shepherd, Israelite leader, friend of God-Moses is certainly one of the most complex, intriguing characters in the Judeo-Christian faith. In this imaginative epic, his story is told by three extraordinary women who inhabited the shadows of his life. There are Merytamon, the Egyptian princess who rescues Moses from the bulrushes and her father's dreadful edict and perpetuates a lie that will haunt her life; Miryam, who's never quite able to relinquish her big-sister role; and Zipporah, Moses' Midianite wife, who struggles to understand the God Who has first claim on her husband's life. Together they give us a unique portrait of Moses as son, brother, husband, and man.Hunt's meticulous research and superb storytelling have created a masterpiece. This poignant story breathes life into the historical figure of Moses. It's also a vivid portrayal of a holy God Who is always just, but seldom safe.-Kristine Wilson"
5,Beyond Moses were some amazing women,"Forget about Moses. His story has been told and retold. But the story of the enslavement and salvation of the Israelites from Egypt has never been told like this.""Mists of Avalon"" is brought to mind by this book. We see the familiar tale told this time through the eyes of the women who lived this story. The story is told by the Princess of Egypt whose barrenness terrified her until she found salvation in a Hebrew child, by Miriam whose enforced role as the protector of her family leads her to bitter self revelation and by Zipphorah whose love of a strange refugee from Egypt place this desert girl center stage in a drama written by a God she does not understand.Marion Zimmer Bradley couldn't have done this saga better. Each woman's voice is distinctive and each character fully fleshed and developed. If you miss this book, you will miss a real gem."
5,The Shadow Women,"This is the story of Moses as you've never read it before. This time the tale is told through the eyes of the three women who knew him best - his sister, the Egyptian daughter of a Pharoah who raised him and his wife.Thoughtful, provocative and highly researched, this epic tale is exciting and imaginative, yet biblically sound. Highly recommended and a must read."
5,Buy this just for dire tribe!!,"First off amazon have the wrong tracklist for the pictured cd!!!The radio edit of Bring It On cuts out a fair bit of the start and some of the breaks and is not very good.Dire Tribe is a terrific song, personally one of my favourite Bside's. It is very energetic and fun with Olly brining his best drumming. The lyrics are mainly about taking drugs but there is nothing at all crude about the lyrics.M57 another gentle song, sounds like quite a few others that are on b sides such as Pick Up the PiecesAll of these songs including the radio edit of Bring it On can be found on Five Men in a Hut, so there is nothing here which cannot be found on the compilation cd."
1,Beware of black marketing,"Please be aware that Soldier Bear brand toys are made for distribution through military stores. The purchase for re-sale constitutes black marketing, and is punishable by law. If you purchase a ""factory sealed"" Soldier Bear toy, you are supporting black marketing. Also, remember to check Soldier Bear toys for re-call. Many were made in China, and re-called for lead-based paint."
4,Don't Panic!,"Before you rush out to harrass your doctor for a Tamiflu script, sit down and get acquainted with the facts. This book can help you get your H5N1 ducks in a row. Dr. Marc Siegal cuts through the media-induced nonsense with a laser scalpel and excises only the facts for us. Fewer than a hundred people have died from Avian Flu since January 2004, yet more than 600 people die every single day from AIDS in Africa. Avain Flu is like ""Missing White Girl Syndrome"" for the rest of us (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_Pretty_Girl_Syndrome).In the US, more people have been shot by Dick Cheney than have contracted Avian Flu. Yes, we are all going to die, but not from H5N1. Thank you Dr. Siegal for standing up to Group Think, Herd Mentality, and thoughtless reactionism."
2,Not easy for an ADD person to read...,"This book is very wordy and the chapters and paragraphs are LONG. Basically it's not written for someone with ADD. Shorter paragraphs and bullet points would have made the important information in the book stand out much better. I found that a lot of the information was how the author ""wants you to have a great sex life"" -- and that line seemed to be repeated through out the book which I found odd...I was looking for a book that had factual and simple information on how ADD affects marriage/close relationships and simple tips on how to work around those issues. Unfortunately I didn't find that with this book."
3,"Limited, but a start","I suppose it is best to say that I *wanted* to like this book. Though I do think Halverstadt shares some meaningful insights into and suggestions about navigating ADD relationships, I also think his perspective is both limited and limiting.Specifically, Halverstadt's chapter on sexuality seems to be based on outdated research and misguided cultural stereotypes regarding sexuality and gender, demonstrating little understanding of the wide range of healthy human sexual and gender expression. Rather than taking the opportunity to explore the many gifts that an ADD-brain can bring to sex, he uses a non-ADD model of sexuality as normative.Additionally the author's bias is strongly heterosexual, monogamous, married (or moving in that direction), and Christian, which may alienate some readers.I would suggest reading for the occasional insightful ""gem"" while maintaining awareness of the book's strong limitations."
3,Fair Read,This book offered less than what I had hoped. It's not a bad read. I picked up one or two pointers. I'm still waiting for the non-ADD spouse to write on the same topic!
5,A. D. D. & Romance by Jonathan Halverstadt,"ADD & Romance is one of the best ADD books that I have ever read. Like anyone with ADD, I had to read it three to be able to remember it but that is me not the book because it was well written. The suggestions in the books have had a very positive on my life and marriage. It is a must read for anyone with ADD and anyone thinking of marring someone with ADD."
5,Extremely Enlightening,I am engaged to be married to someone with A.D.D. I am so grateful for the information in this book. The book has helped me to realize that some of the behaviors I found confusing are really not about me. They are about A.D.D. The education I received by reading this book has helped to enrich my relationship with my fiance.
3,Some Good Information,This book offers a basic understanding of how ADD affects relationships. It's a good book for a spouse or partner of a person with ADD to read. It's also not a bad book for an adult newly diagnosed with ADD.
2,"While not bad, take with a grain of salt...","First, my comment to my partner was ""Well, if you take any number of self-help relationship books, and add three pages about ADHD, you'll have a better help book than this one.""Pros:1. It does help one to think about ADHD and relationships.2. It does help create talking points with your partner about your relationship.Cons:1. It uses pseudoscience and unproven theories of how ADHD works as some of its basis for discussion.2. It is very heavy on the belief that medication can make one with ADHD ""normal"". While psychopharmacological assistance for people with ADHD is good, psychological is also good, and the book tends to ignore that aspect.3. It is based on a traditional M/F married relationship.Overall, I don't know that there is anything better out there. However, this doesn't say this is good.Personally, I'd find a good book on ADHD, and a good book on relationship counseling, and read them together."
2,Poorly written,"While this book may contain some good information and practical advice, I could not get past the sloppily written introduction or langorous details of chapter 1. A good editor would have been a godsend for this topic."
4,SOFT AND CUTE BUT,I DO NOT LIKE HOW THE BOTTOM AND THE EARS ARE NOT SHOWN THAT THEY ARE A DIFFERENT COLOR.
3,Toys are toys and that's all they want to be.,"Toys are toys and that's all they want to be, but I have no clue where this fits in. It's cute, it's soft and it sure is plush but when I saw it at the toy store as I passed by it insulted me. I mean sure I put on a little holiday weight but talk about the pot calling the kettle black. So, i'm sure you know what I'm talking about, he's cute but he's not very friendly. Oh, and just try to have a conversation with him, it's like talking to the wall."
4,Mr. Cow to the rescue!,"Based on a couple of reviews already here, I ordered this for my newborn son. I couldn't give it 5s for Fun and Educational, because it just sits there, and tinkles when shaken, but my son giggles and tracks movements when I dance the cow in front of him. He's started trying to chew on the Mr. Cow's nose, and is learning to grasp it by the ears. The best part is that it's machine washable/dryable, which makes the couple of blurp-baths my boy has given it nothing to be concerned with. And yes, it's MISTER Cow, because it's got no udder. My son (3 mos old at this time) loves it.(Edit: December 2009) My son, now about to turn 6 years, STILL loves Mr. Cow. We've had to replace it once, and when we did, we purchased a second one to have as back-up. Heck, *I* love this cow!"
5,wonderful toy,"My parents got this toy for my son pretty much when he was born. He didnt start playing with it until he was 4 months old. He loves it! When I show it to him he smiles reaches for it..than puts it right into his teething mouth! He sits and chews on it for hours on end sometimes. If hes not chewing on it, hes fiddling wtih the cows ears and tail. I would get this for anyone who is expecting."
5,Timeless,"87th Precinct Mysteries are timeless entertainment. The character development and story line stay consistent from book to book. I care about the men and their families as they take care of business. When I think I have a favorite, it changes in the next chapter. This book is as satisfying as the many other 87th Precinct books available and I have read most of them at least once. I recommend this to anyone lookng for a good mystery, fun and easy to read."
4,Older book,"This was an older book of Mc Bains which is interesting when you get one of those for instance they didn't have cell phones at that time! Makes being detective a lot more interesting, just don't call for help!"
3,BREAD (87th Precinct),Ed McBain does a wonderful job in this police crime mystery.He is the staple in crime writing you can count on.
3,Not Up To Par,I am a great McBain fan but found this book to be lacking the usual guts of many of his other 87th Precinct books. Perhaps he was tired!
5,Multimedia for Learning,Arrived much faster than expected and looked brand new. I was very pleased with the service. Would be happy to order from them again.
5,Good book,Lots of good information. I recommend getting a few coaching books and use the drills and coaching tips that work for you and your team.
3,I read the entire book,"As a new high school baseball coach, I purchased many books in order to help me gain the knowledge I needed to feel confident about beginning a new program. This book is average compared to the rest."
3,Took way too long to read because of the confusing names,"The movie may have won a few Oscars but the book is definitely not much to write home about. There is a great deal of hype out there about this book, but Pasternak's inclination to scrutinize every scene with tedious details and his habit of referring to each character by one of their three names causes one to flip back to the previous pages every five minutes. By the end of the book I was so frustrated that I just finished the book without understanding the significance of half the characters. Pasternak is definitely not in the same class as Tolstoy or Dostoevsky. My suggestion would be to overlook this book and try something much better like Orwell's 1984."
3,Mixed feelings,"There are several section in the book that i find to be very deep, moving, and intellectually interesting. The first would be the pre WWI philosophical discourse by the adults, while zhvago is still just the kid. The next and most emotionally powerful passage is during the Civil War when Zhvago is with the Red Partisans in Siberia. Then there is the end section on the Great Patriotic War. But it ends there, the rest of the book just takes up strands of the plot and leads them to dead ends. I didnt like Lara, Komorovsky, and Strelnikov at all. Pasternak is not a writer he is a poet, his poetry is wounderful and that is what we should read him for. This work simply does not live up to its reputation. It is not the great love stroy David lean filmed in 1965 or the Cold War tool that people make it out to be. Its just a novel with very big ups and downs. Good ideas but badly written with very wooden characters who you dont really feel for."
4,Loved it! Helped me understand the movie....,"I am so glad I read this book about Russia and its revolution...what a great read!! Really helped me to understand the movie and what was actually happening in each scene. Would recommend it to anyone who likes to read historical fiction, as I do! (4 stars)"
3,The Movie really helps,"Great book, but if you really want to understand the plot, watch one of the (2 video) movies!!!"
2,The Russian Revolution is not for me...,"This book was by far the hardest book I've ever had to read. The story was too hard to follow, since I kept getting caught up in the words. It's most likely a good story but the character interplay and the sequence of eventS reminded me of a bad soap opera. The affair between the doctor and Lara was just sickening and I couldn't stick with it for long."
1,a Russian Harlequin Romance,"I didn't like this book at all. The characters were all one-dimensional, more representations of ideals (Mother Russia in Lara; the old intelligentsia in Yuri; the Revolutionary Spirit in Lara's husband) than actual characters--and weakly written, at that. Perhaps Pasternak would have been better served (as would generations of readers) if he had put the story in the form of an epic poem where such things are acceptable."
4,The D.H. Lawrence of Russia,"Actually, making that comment insults Pasternak beyond belief. While DZ is sometimes fantastically rich in its imagery, it rarely evokes much emotion for the contrived characters; (...) I have never read a more beautiful nature description than the ""spring passage"" in all of Russian literature this century. Pasternak is obviously a talented writer, but the long treatises on the place of Jews, the messages of Jesus (and so on and so forth), are just forced and too abstractly intellectual to take a natural place in any prose, much less a text which is already sorely lacking in 'real' people in the first place. A great book, but falling far short on certain fronts."
5,Tragedies of War!,"The movie is my favorite of all times, so I decided to read the book. The movie concentrates mainly on the love story of Lara and Yuri, but the book describes the whole political situation and life in Russia from the revolution of 1905 till the end of WW2.Despite the tragedies and the sufferings, Pasternak is extremely romantic and sensitive to nature and to the surroundings...depicting all that is beautiful even amid the most horrifying pictures of war. I think just to show us the hope and the endurance of the human soul. Even when I felt a little disappointed when there is no more Lara and Yuri for a while, Pasternak's description of the atrocities of war and the extremes that humans reach when fighting for their survival is gloomy and sad. It gives a taste of the bitterness of war and a smell of the cheap human blood everywhere..I loved it! I even felt so heart broken just like Yuri when he reads Tonia's letter ... great story, tragic love, unaccomplished life!"
3,Good Russian literature,"I read this book many years ago when I was 13 or 14 so my memory is a little fuzzy on the details, but I remember it made a huge impression on me at the time. I saw the movie and that is what originally inspired me to read the book, but there is a lot more to the book than just the love story that was portrayed in the movie. There is a lot of political and social history presented in the novel, but not so much that it overwhelms the reader. The story and the history are balanced very well. The main character strives to do well and survive against the odds, which was inspirational despite the fact that so many unfortunate incidents happened to him."
2,Not the LOG we know today,"This album is still very much like Burn the Priest; it doesn't sound much like the LOG we know today. I guess if you liked ""Burn the Priest"" then you'll like this. I thought it was weak, hence the two stars. Also, NAG is a poorly recorded album (even after whatever enhancements they did). If you don't already have it, get ""Killapelphia"" instead. The best songs from this album are performed on the live album and it's a much better recording.The bonus track, ""Nippon,"" was kind of cool. To bad it isn't a better recording.Not recommended."
1,Metal?,"This is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever heard. I guess it's due to the fact that I listen to good music like PANTERA or BLACK LABEL SOCIETY. Last time i checked playing music required tallent, this band is short of it. I listen to bands that have screaming but this is disgusting. If your looking for some real music Shadows Fall is great, chimaria aint too bad. But ""metal"" just isnt real metal with out solos!"
2,Sad...,"I'm a metal head but I'm not a fan of this type of metal but the quality is good and these guys are somewhat from my area, but I'm just not a fan of the Rah, Rah, Rah, Blah, Blah screaming mess. I love the guitars and the band itself just NO vocals and melody. It's very one dimensional, but different strokes for different folks. If you like war hooting and demon squealing Death Metal then you'll love this. Sorry guys not a fan of it (just an opinion though, don't get bent over it)."
1,LOL OMG,"I can usually tell the difference between tones in music...but this...this...confounds me. Also, what are they saying? Anybody want to help me understand these neaderthals? This isn't even music. Takes no talent to do something like that, just beat the #$@()%*& out of a chord and scream at the top of your lungs in another language it seems sometimes. As you can't understand them.ONE STAR FOR EFFORT"
1,This aint metal!,"ROAR!! I AM THE BOOGIE MAN!! ROAR!! This is terrible. The vocals sound like glass in a garbage disposal. This is bad stuff. It's cool to try and be different, and in listening to the tracks, I tried to take that point of view, but, this is just bad. This is a CD for the kid that want's to make sure everyone around him hates the music he listens too."
1,Horrible,"My teacher recently bought this album (as a joke I think). I listened to it and it sucks. I'm sure that this band has talent, but they're not showing much of it on the album. Why is it so hardcore when a guitarist plays a single chord over and over and the lead singer sounds like he's puking into the microphone? The drumming is good, but otherwise, this album is just annoying noise. For real heavy metal, look no further than Black Sabbith or Zeppelin. At least you can hear what Ozzy and Robert Plant are saying!"
1,lambofgod,"what is this? why do bands have to blame all of their worries on God? the style of music is very good but is full of hatred and blame. why do they swear at God? is it a common belief that it is God's fault for suffering? well if it is, then maybe it is God's fault, but none can grow without suffering, i too have suffered, many have suffered worse than these guys, or any of us for that matter, we are selfish in our thinking, and this cd only promotes that hatred towards God, my God, their God, your God!"
3,What kind of poser crap?,What kind of title for a band is Lamb Of God if it is not a christian band.Talk about poser bands.Musically there is not much originality.They sound like a Slayer rip off or something.
2,Progressive metal means to make progress...,...something this band does not do. There are quite a few bands like this these days. Their songwriting structures are all over the place. Melody and the focus there of is lacking. The guitar riffs are boring and are put together like a puzzle that is missing plenty of its pieces. That is the kindest thing I can say about these guys.
1,"good band, bad album","This is totally pathetic. Lamb of God recorded an album too early when they didnt know what the hell they were doing. This is a good band, but only now they're good. Before they sucked and it's a good thing that they're increasing their talents instead of decreasing them...*cough*metallica*cough*. Everything in the album ""As the Palaces Burn"" is better in every way to their older stuff. Drumming stays fairly the same, but the guitarwork is so much better and the vocals dont sound like some guy having his balls torn off anymore...instead they sound like a guy having his body ran over by a train:). lol, the point is that they sound like real death metal now and not like some wannabe heavy band like hmmmm...Nothingface lol"
4,Unique,"Everything there is to be said has been said so i'll make this short. There is nothing worse than buying a CD and realizing its the exact same music as some of your other CDs, that is not going to happen with this. No band out there really sounds like Lamb of God, guaranteed."
5,Clearly........,"this is the best effort Lamb of God have ever recorded. Anyone who actually opens their ears will agree. The problem you people are having is you got hooked on their latter efforts first, then popped in New American Gospel and realized the riffs they are playing 8 years later have not changed one bit. So you don't like it because it sounds the same when in fact, New American Gospel came before all their other boring albums. Not to mention the fact that at least back then, they could do those songs with some speed and not just do 500 groove only riffs like they are channeling Funkadelic. The bottom line is this band pretty much sucks the royal backside, but if you are going to even give this band a chance you might as well start and end with this album, because the rest are so worthless it's not even funny."
5,Power metal,This album is the best heavy metal album of century. If you like hard hitting in your face with non stop riffs then this is the album to buy. There is nothing that this cd does not have. Lamb of God will soon be well known across the nation.
4,"Opened up to it, good album","At first, as I described in my As the Palaces Burn album review. I didn't like NAG because of the screaming vocals. But, like I have for other bands, I guess as I heard heavy metal more my ears and senses got more open to the different types of metal. Afterwards, I got used to the vocals and they weren't bad sounding to me anymore, not noticing any faults in how Randy sounded on this album. I do proudly say now that I like New American Gospel."
2,Totally different band than LOG today.,"I can't get into this CD. Even though Randy Blythe's current cookie-monster vocal style is far from the most musical aspect of LOG, the vocal performance on this CD is indiscernible and muted with a lot of high pitch screaming. I believe the mixing also leaves something to be desired. As one of my friends put it, ""the double kick sounds like it is being played with two empty coke bottles."" The CD also lacks the great riffing that I usually enjoy like about Lamb of God. I'm sure there are those who love this CD. It just isn't my taste."
5,MUCH STRONGER THAN AS THE PALACES BURN!,"this album is not quite as tiring as ""as the palaces burn"" though both of these creations are truly amazing. the only thing that could be better on this album is the order of the songs. these guys have devastating talent."
5,Amazing,"Never have i heard such an explosive debut. The jackhammer guitars, [excellent]drumming and the ferocius vocals all combine to make and incredible record. This is pure american metal at its finestthe production could use some work, especially on the bass drums which sounds muffled. Also the vocals are drowned out by the guitars.Other than that, this album is amazing in every sense. buy this and buy ATPB and see em live. LOVE REAL METAL"
2,Just barely okay...,"This definitely does not show extremely hot girls. It is more an add-on to the pictures of the girls that appeared on the Real World and Survivor. I am not a big fan of these girls, nor do I think that they picked the right girls to be in these DVDs, except for maybe Trishelle, who is pretty hot. But Arissa and Katie? They just don't seem to fit here. I wouldn't really care for DVDs like this at all, I am a much bigger fan of the regular Playmates in Playboy, but if they do want to pick Real World girls, they should maybe get some others, like Rachel. ( The one with dark hair, no the ugly one with the blonde hair.) The whole thing comes down to this. If you are a casual fan of Playboy, you will maybe not care too much for this DVD. On the other hand, if you love the Real World girls, then you might find this DVD interesting and entertaining to watch. This one is strictly opinion."
2,Just okay,"I don't know about you, but I bought this to see the girls from the real world las vegas. They are okay. Worth a look, but that's it."
1,What I call Reality B.S.,First off the girls are at best mediocre and if I wanted to hear girls talk about themselves I'll go pretend to listen to my girlfriends conversation. Honestly this isn't even remotely interesting. If you want to prevent your young teenaged son from watching dirting films this agonizing film will do the trick MONEY BACK GAURANTEED!!!
5,Great plant based digestive enzyme,Been using this product a long time. It is a great plant based digestive enzyme from a top notch high quality company. You must try it!!
2,okay stuff but there is better out there....,"I was looking for a similar compound to Supreme Enzymes(""SE"") made by Chantilly Health in Florida. Based on the ad I thought I'd found it. But it really doesn't compare. The SE's are the best. I don't think that there is compliment to them out there. Chantilly Health's web site isn't the best. So if you want them call!"
3,Probably for Viking fans only,"This is the second part of Treece's trilogy about the Norwegian Viking, Harald Sigurdson. It's set in about the year 800 and tells a fairly typical adventure for a Norwegian Viking of the period, sailing to Ireland in search of treasure. Later, however, the tale gets a bit more fantastic, when Harald is shipwrecked and ends up in Miklagard (Constantinople), the capital of the Byzantine Empire. He serves there are a guardsman. He could be seen as a forerunner of the famed Byzantine Guard.Treece's language is very simple in these books; its probably intended more for children or adolescents then for adults. However, it provides a good character study for the grim, brave Vikings,and it provides a fair smattering of Viking myths, stories, and jokes. All in all I found this enjoyable (though not as good as Viking's Dawn), but I'm a Viking fanatic. Not everyone's idea of a good read."
5,Mood enhancing,"The irrepressible and gleefully irreverent Anita O'Day sings the witty tunes of Cole Porter as if they were just composed yesterday, all against the brassy arrangements of Billy (""The Flintstones"") May. The result stands next to Mel Torme Swings Shubert Alley as one of the most cheerful and swinging jazz vocal albums of all-time ... and certainly the greatest take ever on the Porter songbook."
2,What's the opposite of perfect pitch?,"I have long heard great things about Anita O'Day. And you can't go wrong with a passel of Cole Porter songs. Or so I thought. This is the great Anita O'Day? I must be missing something. Does anyone remember Biff Rose? I once went to one of his performances in Ann Arbor. He joked that if we thought we heard him miss a note, ""that's just jazz."" Well, this CD must be ""jazz"" because it is filled with Ms. O'Day jarringly missing notes. I'm being generous with my two-star rating."
5,ANITA TAKES CHANCES,"You probably heard PORTER tunes done by ELLA or SINATRA,and that's interesting.With ANITA ,the approach is more risqué but so rewarding in the end.ANITA is a singer who likes to takes chances,and on this 1959 session,she is matched with BILLY MAY,who was born to work with the often difficult O'DAY.What fun it is to hear them do relectures of the famous PORTER tunes,even if you know them by heart!So, you may like that album a lot if you are game ,or hate it if you are not,it's just as simple as that.The lyrics to YOU'RE THE TOP are not the originals,but work just the same with YOU'RE THE BOP,SARAH and YARDBIRD among the word changes made to the song.One wonders though what PORTER thought of the liberties taken with his songs.This is ANITA O'DAY in full command and in her prime.A message to VERVE:will you please release the 1960 ANITA O'DAY swings RODGERS AND HART with BILLY MAY in north AMERICA?"
5,One of the best books I have ever read for preK,The rhythm and rhyme of the storyline is absolute genius (and I am a high school English teacher). The imagery coupled with vivid adjectives and word play make this story come to life. Absolutely a favorate for my sons and myself.
5,Love it!,"We love this book. After hoarding it at the library by renewing it to the limit several times, I finally ordered it so my younger son can now enjoy it too! When my oldest was 2, he would listen to it again and again and laugh at the predicament of the animals. The rhyme is wonderful and the illustrations are bright and full of fun. He is 4 now...and still loves to ""read"" the book with me."
1,What won't Traci try?,"Porn, music, acting, and now exercise. When will the world wake up? I can't wait to go into a McDonald's and see Traci Lords, Tim McGraw, Tom Greene, and Pauly Shore all working there."
5,Most Telling Perspective,"I've read many books by and about Holocaust survivors, and have found that those told ""in their own words"" to be the most immediate and telling. What differentiates this book from many others is that it adds the singular perspective of how each survivor adjusted to a new world that offered not dire, but significant ordinary challenges."
4,works well,I use this product on my dog's nose. She has lupus which caused her to lose all the pigment on her nose. Sunshine exacerbates the problem. The LipCotz Lip Balm SPF 45 has been most effective. The pigment is returning. Hooray!
1,I didn't get the relief I was expecting for the money..,If it had cost more I would have sent it back. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants chapped lip reflief.
4,Great Lip Balm with high SPF 45,"I have used it few times when I go for water sports; so far, I think it does its jobs, sun-protection & moisture, and I like its pleasent light smell and non-greasy feeling. I have been researching for a great one to protect my lips under the sun without worrying too many during water activities. It's pricy for a lip balm, but the money is worth."
5,Great Album!,One of the albums that saved my teenage existence. While the hit songs will get you to purchase the album....you need to also listen to my two favorites...I Believe and Head Over Heels.One of the fisrt albums I could listen to in it's entirety.
3,Not worth the extra money,"The original of this album is a classic, of course. But the new material not only doesn't improve it--it actually makes the record worse. There are seven new ""songs"" on this, but five of them are really electronic noodlngs that weren't good enough to be put out. They're quite boring, actually, and represent a marked letdown from the quality of the album's original tracks.The two remix tracks are nothing special, though the version of Shout is kinda fun. So if you already have Songs from the Big Chair, no need to buy this..."
3,Don't waste your time,"The original of this album is an '80s classic, but this tarted-up edition adds nothing new particularly worth having. Five of the seven new songs are just junk that you'll never listen to more than once. The two remixes are pleasant, but not particularly interesting. All told, stick to the original album; there's a reason why TFF didn't put these other songs on ""Songs from the Big Chair."" And there's a reason why the record company has put them on now: To get you to buy a record you probably already have."
5,songs from the big chair TFF,"Pedazo de álbum, probablemente el mejor de su carrera, aunque The Seeds Of Love fuera el más caro y grandioso.Impresionante las variaciones de las secciones rítmicas, las melodías profundas y directas como esa entrada de ""Head Over Heels"" al teclado y guitarra o el tempo como ""giratorio"" de Everybody Wants to Rule The World con un bridge subiendo y bajando en la escala, ""girando"".Instrumentos que ejecutan frases jazzísticas, la frialdad de Shout... En definitiva, impresionante, que manera de inventar genialidades. Por qué ya nadie hace algo así.----------Great album, probably the best of the TFF career,although the biggest and expensive album was The Seed Of Love."
4,Songs from the Big Chair,"Great album! I don't have this remastered version, but I'm speaking for the original. Only complaint: it could be longerMost people know it for the chart-toppers ""Shout"" and ""Everybody wants to rule the world"", as well as ""mothers talk,"" ""i believe"", and ""head over heels.""Ironically, I think my favourite songs on here are 2 of the 3 non-singles: ""The Working Hour"" and ""Listen"". Funny how it always seems to work out that wayA great album"
2,unnecessary and overpriced,"The original album- 8 songs- is a five star album. I can listen to it straight through without any problem. I also don't mind the remastered edition that came out a few years ago that expanded this to 15 tracks. It has most of the same bsides/bonus tracks found here- but you can get it for half the price of this. So what do you get for the extra $15 here? 12 remixes. Big deal. I don't need to hear 4 versions of Shout in one sitting. Do yourself a favor and get the single disc of this for half the price, OR get Chonicles instead: It has the same 15 track remastered and expanded version of this album PLUS you get the expanded and remastered Hurting and Sowing the Seeds of Love CDS- 26 other (great) songs instead of 12 (boring) remixes. That's 3 expanded remastered CDs for the same price as this bloated mess."
2,The remastering has left to be desired,"This is a great album from the 80's that I have always loved, but unfortunately this remaster has one fatal flaw: it is remastered to be LOUD. It's a shame that this had to happen to such a great album. One example is during the song ""The Working Hour"" when the drums come in, all you can hear is clipping of the signal! Even if you disable your equalizer, the distortion still exists. So if you're an audiophile or enthusist, avoid this release and get the original 1985 release or the 1990 release. The purpose of a remaster is to increase clarity, not increase volume! I'm totally disappointed."
1,Never arrived,I ordered this item and after two weeks had not received it.I contacted Amazon about this issue and it took three weeks to get my money refunded. In the end it never showed up I would have gladly paid for it if it had arrived. I still want this album but I am not ordering it from this vendor and I may never order from this vendor again.
3,Chukka Needs Work,"I have worn these for some time now and can only rate them as mediocre.The ankle support should be two padded ridges instead of just one. This would provide more ankle support.The insoles can just be removed and tossed, because you will want something that provides some real comfort. I chose Orthotics such as Dr. Scholls.The velcro closures could be made so that they can be pulled up tighter for a snug fit. The pieces fixed to the lower part are not long enough.Last, but not least, the tongue is just a single layer of what appears to be split cowhide leather. The designer should have taken an example from other manufacturers and heavily padded the tongue for more comfort and support.Not worth the cost is my opinion."
5,Ben-10 Series Season 3,"This was a gift for my 3-year grandson who seems to love Ben-10, and has made me watch the series with him. Its not ""Space Ghost"" or ""Johnny Quest"" that I enjoyed in my younger years, but he seems to enjoy it and like to role play Ben's character too! This is same review for Seasons 1, 2 and 4 as well as Omnitrac."
1,IT HAD LITE SCRATCHE'S,I BOUGHT THIS BEN 10 THE COMPLETE SEASON 3 NEW AND THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE BOUGHT THIS MOIVE AMAZON SENT US ANOTHER ONEWHEN MY SON OPENED IT. IT HAD ABOUT 6 LIGHT SCRATCHES THIS MOIVE COMES WITH 2 DVDS IN ONE CASE AND BOTH DVD'S HADA LOT OF LIGHT SCRATCHES AND THIS ITEM WAS NEW THIS IS THE SECOND TIME AMAZON.COM SENT MY SON A NEW ONE AND IT WAS SCRATCHEDIT WAS A LOT OF SCRATCHES NOT JUST ONE BUT A LOT ON THE SECOND DISK MY SON DID NOT DO IT BECAUSE I WATCHED HIM OPEN ITAT MY KICTHEN TABLE AND I TOLD HIM TO WAIT AND LET ME OPEN IT AND I CHECKED IT AND IT HAD SCRATCHES SO DO NOT BUY THISIN LESS YOU WANT TO DISAPOINT YOUR KID.
5,Great,"Not only my son but all the boys in my family love this movie, they don't get bored from watching it over and over"
5,The best for French Food and Wine,"I have subscribed to this magazine for many years (via their own website (English version)) and I love this publication. Some of the ingredients may be hard to find outside France but having been lucky to work there for several years at least I know what they are! Many of the recipes are typically French and as such would be hard to find elsewhere. The articles are informative and highlight the differences in the culinary styles from region to region.If you like France and love food, this magazine will be a joy from cover to cover."
1,No show to my order to Cuisine Et Vins De France,"Unfortunately, I have never received my subscription that I paid for. I have always had good success with Amazon orders but not this time. I keep waiting for my subscription to start, but no luck. Maybe someone will figure this out and get it to me."
5,The authoritative book of SiGe HBTs,"Definitely not an average beta=Ic/Ib book; it tells you the various factors that go into this equation (and more, of course). The discussion on noise and linearity is in-depth, and more importantly, touches upon circuit-level topics. There is plenty of actual measured data, as well as illustration of practical measurement techniques and sets.This book is suitable for senior-level undergraduate and graduate students, as well process, device and circuit engineers."
3,Good not perfect,"Before purchasing this camera case I purchased a hard case. I hated that case due to the weight, size and the fact that you had to remove the viewfinder assembly to put the camera in the case. That was returned. I wanted a case where I could quickly remove the camera and begin shooting. This is a good well padded case that allows that but if it were raining the camera would definately get wet based on the long flap on the top. My other concern is the zipper that can scratch the camera. I would like to see a soft protective flap around the zipper that once the case is open the camera is shielded from that long zipper on both sides. Lastly this case is a little narrow for a Canon XL2. Length is fine but a tad too snug on the sides. I'm thinking of buying an additional XL2 and I will research other cases before purchasing another one of these."
5,"Slow, warm, Single Mault Joy","I have been sitting in an airport for 4 hours, listing to the Sweet Hereafter on repeat. I could wait for another 4.This music is not for everyone. It is slow, steady, and smooth. Jesse's alto and Phil's guitair make this a perfect Southern Gothic moment (that has lasted for hours). There is no point that stands out clearly in this album. The album exists as a whole! It is complete, and perfect.Jesse, et al. have taken alt-country and redefined it. Without a hint of twang she produces a clear Western sound, filtered through Mazzy-Starish (new word, thanks Hope!) psychodelia.You should check out Reckless Burning also, if for no other reason then the amazing title track."
4,late night treat,"This album is a late night treat. Tasteful guitars and arrangements complement Sykes' breathy and accented vocals. The mood overall is sombre, but elements of mystery and lurking threat in the lyrics add edge to the mood."
5,Don't like Country Music,"but I love Jesse Sykes. Mellow, sad, dark but beautiful. I first heard a song by Jesse on the HBO show TrueBlood song track and wondered who is this? I had to find her and went on Playlist.com to find other songs. I was hooked and had to buy 2 CD's right then. I'm definitely going to buy all her CD's."
3,Dirge-Like Alt.Country,"Jesse Sykes & the Sweet Hereafter is slow, dirge-like alt.country - you can practically smell the dirt road after a humid summer rain in a drought-stricken county. Sykes second release, Oh, My Girl, is languorous and consistent. That's to say that the pace doesn't alter more than a few degrees from leisurely. Which makes for tough listening - it's a slog to get through all ten songs in fifty-two minutes. Too bad, because the songs are all pretty excellent, with special mentions to the haunting ""The Dreaming Dead"" and the homoerotic title track. Sykes has a dusty voice perfect for this music - a bit arid, very erotic. Yet much as I like this record, I hope somebody lights a fire under her ass next time - I bet she'd make a thrilling down'n'dirty screamer."
4,Makes a desperate situation uplifting...,"This is an important work. While politicians debate vouchers, schools defend programs, and psychologists analyze standardized tests, the inner-city youth are reduced to numbers, incentives, and statistical variables. This book approaches youth as people. Written and photographed by artists, the book offers fresh insight into the minds of children; what they think and feel. Whether a liberal or conservative, people should care about the thoughts of others, particularly society's offspring. The Gift of Imagination celebrates our greatest gift-- our ability to think as individuals."
2,"Fine For TV, NOT FINE FOR $23","Yes, it'a moving story and yes it's based on real life, and yes, it was Reeve's last project before his death, but this drama with a somewhat weak ending appears to be made for TV and that's about as good as it is. Fair acting, not enough substance beyond the plot line to be worth $23 because it runs like like a lifetime movie. The only thing missing are the commercials."
3,It's okay,"If you're looking for a realistic portrayal of what a quadriplegic goes through on a daily basis and the challenges of meeting life's needs, this movie will not provide that. It only addresses the difficulties of paralysis in a very brief, contained, and limited way.Rather this movie is meant to be inspirational, motivational. It coats everything in an almost cheesy, upbeat, optimistic manner, yes, it's based on a true story, but the portrayal is almost unrealistic in how well everything clicks into place and just works out well almost right away. I like details so I would have liked to view the nitty-gritty, the real difficult moments, the raw moments - those are so human and real-life.This movie was okay though. Her mother really was such a great support to her."
5,the brooke ellison story,it is a good move i like true stories and amazon is a good company to deal with and they have good prices
4,"Well made, slightly overpriced","My son loves Bob the Builder, so he is thrilled with these toys. They made of metal so they are durable. They are small; they fit in the palm of an adult hand. I'm happy with the quality but I think $20 is a lot to pay for this product."
1,Filled with factual errors ....,"It amazed me, as a casual student of American History, to find so many factual errors in this short children's book dealing with the US Supreme Court. It refers to Justices Wendell and Blackmun as Chief Justices of the Supreme Court when in fact they were Associate Justices. Although the book was published in 2000, it says that the Constitution has had only had 26 amendments, even though the 27th amendment was ratified in 1992.What's more, the book tells you very little about the actual workings of the court. It deals broadly with the court's historical importance which I personally found misleading since the title is ""Your Government: How it Works: The US Supreme Court"".Arthur M. Schlesinger's name is shown on the cover as ""Consulting Editor"". My best guess is that any consulting Mr. Schlesinger did on this one was strictly from a distance."
2,Boring to 6 month old,"Our 6 month old was not interested in this AT ALL. He was much more impressed with a rubber duck than this toy. Maybe when he's older, he might get more enjoyment out of it, but in the meantime, it's sitting in a basket. Now he LOVES theMunchkin Star Fountain(in blue)."
2,Doesn't swim well,I purchased this for use in the pool. It doesn't swim well unless you first pick it up out of the water to let the water drain out of the tail. I was disappointed. My 8 month old got bored of it really quickly.
3,"Super cute, but doesn't work well","I bought this for my daughter so she can play with it in the bath. It's super cute and she loves it, but the wind up function doesn't work very well. Basically, the lobster barely swims/moves in the water, so it's kind of boring."
3,it works,"The lobster is a great little toy. It's a little slow in the water, but it goes and doesn't sink. My son thinks it's pretty neat."
1,No wonder it's free,"Repetitive and boring would be a better way to describe the game. It's not at all any sort of free roaming racing because of the checkpoint system. I would definitely not recommend this game to anyone. Deleted a day after I installed it. Nothing to see here, move along."
3,I like this movie...,"In fact, anything Colin Firth is in is quite good. I haven't seen this movie in a while, but I do remember that it was quite charming and Colin Firth really makes the character very likeable."
4,One Fantastic Band!,This album rocks! It is definitely worth your time! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that the album does not do justice to the energy of the live shows. Check it out!
4,GREAT CD!,i just bought this cd last night.......and have listened to about 5 times already...........it's fantastic!
1,Incompatible with newer iPods,This is basically a nice dock but would not work with a 4th generation iPod. It seems there are a bunch of older docks on the market that won't work with newer iPods - we are going to try a different one after much research.
5,Good read !,"This book is wonderful for first time AB owners to seasoned veterans that want to know some background abou the dogs. From the proper feeding to iron dog training or the conformation ring, I enjoyed this book alot and for anyone that wants a bulldog other the to just lay on the couch and take up space they or cuddle , will relate to this book very well."
4,Great book on the history of the American Bulldog!!!!,I really enjoyed this book for many reasons: 1)This is a good book for the history of the American Bulldog...there are not a lot of books out there on American Bulldogs 2)The pictures are awsome 3)Written very well. I would recommend this book to anyone that has an American Bulldog or is thinking about owning one.
3,Outdated but gives good history of the breed,"The book by Putnam is now outdated, by a mile. It was a good book when it was published. The breed has developed into two or three breeds. Performance, standard (show), and Bully (totally show). The only ones that work anymore are the perfomance ones. In terms of info in the book, again, it is totally outdated and has no relavance anymore.This book is a classic. I would buy this book as a history lesson of this young breed. Bully dog fans may not be a big fan of this book, although it does mention some MGK stuff that Putnam had. Buy it."
1,Don't Buy This Opinion,"While this book has some fairly decent photos, it is not well written and is VERY opinionated!! This guy is NOT AN EXPERT and should have spent time with his AB's instead of wasting time writing this book!!!! Everyone has an opinion, if we all took the time to put it book form.... just imagine!!!"
3,"""My "" Working American Bulldog","The most comprehensive book to date on the subject of the American Bulldog. Dave Putnam really did his homework as for as the history & orgins of the breed, although when he gets to the modren AB it becomes more obvious that he favors the ""standard"" over the larger ""Johnson"" type. With that aside I still consider it ""a most have"" for any AB owner, except I think he should have change the name of the book from ""The Working AB"" to ""My Working AB"" seeing as how most of the text is about personal experiences of his dog, & not the breed in general."
2,fine music but... what a mess with the tracks of the cd!,"I love Hodges' music very much, but in this cd the tracks from 6 to 11 are a real mess, worse than what the previous reviewer pointed out: track 6 includes both ""Autumn in New York"" (piano only) and ""Sweet Lorraine""(like a medley); consequently the following tracks from 7 to 10 correspond to the titles shown as tracks 8 to 11 on the cover. Moreover, on track 11 you can listen to a very nice version of ""All of Me"", which of course is not mentioned on the cover!That's why my rating, instead of 4 or 5 for the music, is 2 for the CD!"
2,"Passable, but not as good as it could be.","Perry's anthology on the philosophy of personal identity has a good selection of analytic articles and essays, but little information that actually introduces and explores the field, which is especially necessary for those approaching the field for the first time. Neither does the text include certain study tools which would be extremely useful and would assist in a better treatment and understanding of the topic (such as a glossary of terms important to personal identity, etc.). All in all, I think the text could be greatly improved if it were more user-friendly and updated."
3,Not as pictured,"This is a very nice flag. HOWEVER, based on the picture, I was surprised to receive a white plastic window hanger with suction cups, as opposed to a pole....big difference if you're planning to display this flag in your yard. Again, very nice flag, though."
4,A concept that's fresh,"When I read the description of this movie and saw the cover, I was intrigued. The movie itself provides for some meaningful conversation and some laughs(mostly because of Renner), but seriously- a black woman and a neo nazi---falling love? That is a concept I have never even entertained.The movie gets four stars for me because: 1)It is an original concept, 2) The main actors Gabriele Union and Jeremy Renner were beautiful and crazy, and 3) It's a Code Black film- independent, love it.I would love to give away details about this one, but I'd rather not. Just see it for yourself, its very good.Why not the fifth star? Neo Ned could have earned the last star if it was longer and had a more developed plot. It was such a quick movie but I did enjoy it mostly."
4,Renner's charisma and energy is golden,"Jeremy Renner can not be beat, the only comparison in his abilities is Edward Norton. This movie is an original quirky love story about two broken people who find love in the strangest of places, a mental institute. A harmless neo-nazi with no self control and an African American woman who is as guarded as one can be due to her past. Strangely they are perfect for one another. Renner gives a performance of a character that is manic and reckless but still remains completely lovable. Union's character is so broken, but even with all her demons she is completely charming. The two, although completely broken, together seem to make a whole person. I have no clue how they pulled this off. This is a purely actor driven movie. It is a good example of the greatness one can find in independent film."
5,Neo-Ned is fun and enlightening,"To preface this review, I spend a lot of time watching movies. I love films that take a different perspective on life, films that get me to think. I would classify Neo Ned as a romantic comedy that has a wonderful mix of enjoyable, funny scenes, as well as thought provoking moments.After seeing the film, I find myself wondering what social grudges or generalizations I make on a daily basis. While being lighthearted overall, Neo Ned explores some of the darker aspects of life, helping one to recognize that, despite the past, you do have control over the future. Social stigmas can be overcome regardless of upbringing.Neo Ned is a film that manages to be highly enjoyable due to a quirky story while analyzing key social issues. Do yourself a favor and give this one a watch, it's worth it."
2,Not bad,"I really like the characters, I cared about them. The acting was really good. I would not watch it again as it was somewhat depressing. Not a happy ending."
5,Neo Ned,Wow! All I can say about this DVD is that I had no idea it would be such good dramatic acting from two of my favorite actors.
1,Not a worthy rental nor purchase.,You'd think the concept of a 'tard dating a black chick who thinks she's Hitler would have been pure comic genius. lol Not here!
5,Only on a rare occasion..,"Only on a rare occasion can I say that a movie that went straight to Starz then DVD, actually DESERVED a nationwide release in theaters. The acting, plot originality, flow, composition, and the way issues (such as racism, etc...) are portrayed in the film were all superbly done. It definitely should have been shown across the country. I look forward to Van Fischer's next movie, whenever that may be. Just hope I don't have to wait three years+ to see it. :-)Show your support for Neo Ned, it is definitely a movie worth buying."
4,Flaws in the script,"I really do like Jeremy Renner and wanted to see his early work. However, the story left me asking a lot of questions. Especially concerning Gabrielle Union's character. I won't go into detail because I do not want to give away the plot.All in all it was a good low budget movie."
1,This book sorely needs a good index.,You buy an 800-page book on Windows 98. Then you cannot find the specific topic you are looking for. Arrrrgggghhh!!! This book needs a solid index or an accompanying cd that allows you to search for specific topics. This book is not nearly as useful as it could be.
5,Not having this book = using Win98 w/no monitor,"Hey you need to buy this book, you need to read this book, then you need to read it again. I am a MCP for Win95 and have a pretty good handle of win98 after all the Beta abuse i suffered. This book told me things that I didn't know! I can't imagine what it would be like being able to use this book and not knowing a little about Win98 before hand. It's like wearing your glasses (those of you who wear glasses :) if not.. use your imagination) or not wearing your glasses. Woody and Barry clear the picture up for you. Buy it, read it, you WON'T regret it!!!"
1,Give It Up!!!,"Quite going on and on about your 'publishing contract' and your 'publisher' and how you were accepted on the 'first submission'. You are published by PublishAmerica, the ultimate vanity house. This is the same fine publishing house that brought us 'Atlanta Nights'. Pretentious and quite writing your own reviews!"
3,A Good Buy...In My Case,"I already own several Mindstorms Sets so I bought this Spybotics set more out of curiosity than anything else....BR>It was fairly easy to set up despite the fact that officially Lego doesn't support the software under Windows 2000, which I use. No serial port problems and no failures so far.Its good for teaching kids the basics of robotics if they're not ready for Mindstorms.My four year old son is intrigued by it and I imagine most 8 to 10 year olds would have no trouble building and using it...."
4,So Easy to Put Together,"I bought 2 of these for my two sons ages 5 and 6 1/2, Gigamesh and Shadowstrike. The computer instructions were very simple, although many pages long, that my two boys put their vehicles together all by themselves! I ended up getting another one, Snaptrax as my husband wanted one to play with the boys and my son didn't like Gigamesh as much as the many wheels make it slower than the others and a bit loud and bumpy on the floor. Overall we all think Shadowstrike is the best of the 4. The only thing is not very ""durable"" for rough play. My boys like to chase each others vehicles and try to turn them over to ""lose the battle"" and then you have to put the vehicle back together again. The spy missions are few, so just fun to play with them as remote control vehicles."
4,if this toy worth the money,I am a lego lover. I happen to have a lego spybotic. It is very fun to use. Once i got it i had no clue to what it was like. [...]. It is very useful for the person with out a clue. That was just a tip.Lego spybotcs are fun but are they worth the money. The missons are king of corny and some of the misson need two people. If your son or daguater is buying one i suggest you talk with the childrens parents in the neghibor hood. Also the toy is fun for about two weeks then the speacailness wears off. It sits in the corner of the room picking up the dust. Usually because the toy is hard to use. It is so complicated. If person you are buying it for is in to spying then i highly suggest it. It is very fun and is enjoyable. Please don't let my review stop you from making your child happy.
5,Simply elegant & touching works,"I am taking a Women in Literature class and one of our assignments was to choose a living female author and read one of her works. Because I am of Polish descent, I decided to read Ms. Szymborska's poems and I bought this collection. Her poems are very touching and direct. I appreciate the honesty that she uses and how some of her poems were derived from various world events (i.e. Vietnam, the Holocaust, etc.) and I could sense her obvious disdain for the Communism that had taken over Poland. My favorite poem from this collection is ""Utopia"". I could just read all of her poems over and over. It's a shame you don't hear much about her. I recommend that anyone read these poems and you will be deeply touched."
5,"Like Darkness, but more Rock than Shlock","Not sure if this is a joke, but regardless, they're playing some damn good arena rock. I would've loved these guys back in the mullet-owning 80s - excellent riffing, catchy tunes, and approach that is somehow both classic rock and hair metal. They've got a heavy 70s Zep/Deep Purple influence in their rhythm and lyrics (Midas Touch, Stone Fox), and the vocals, guitars, and rockitude are reminiscent of early 80s Motley Crue, LA Guns, with maybe some late 70s Van Halen thrown in. Rather than be a cheeky Darkness-like project of irony, these guys sound and feel like the real deal. And since I like to rock out just like the next guy, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and assuming that they do, indeed, like to ROCK. I would totally be their groupie."
4,Let's Hear For The Covers,"I went into these cd's knowing that they are all covers and I was impressed for the most part. Some of the vocals sound too much like the cover artist is trying to imitate the original group/artist. The key tracks are, ""Save A Prayer,"" ""The Sun Always Shines On TV,"" ""Every Breath You Take,"" and ""Doot, Doot."" Those are my personal favorites, at least."
5,Where did they come from?,"This band exploded onto the scene last year with this unholy hybrid mixture of raging blak metal and swedish melodic death metal. There is so much rage and anger contained in this one recording it amazing that it can be contained by a mere CD! Excellent production courtesy of Studio Fredman, and mastered by the mighty James Murphy (you know, he was in some small bands for a couple of years..hehehe) Excellent! Raging!Unhallowed Blood rules all!"
5,Excellent!,"This book was recommended by my college physics advisor to help grasp spacial relativity. Really well written, a summary of many areas of modern science. Everyone should read this book!"
5,Best Long Lasting Smelling Candle for the $,"I am an absolute candle lover and have been for over 10 years. I've been supplying myself with Archipelago Botanicals for over 5 years straight, with the exception of Yankee Candles once in a while due to a lack of $. This candle is pretty expensive, but coming from a student it's worth it! The smell stays in your room and migrates into other rooms leaving it nice and soothing. The citrus smell of Luna is sooooo addictive and peaceful...I yearn for this candle after a LONG train ride on the Green line of the MBTA. The candle is soy based, and when you blow it out it doesn't leave that smelly burned smell (I think candle people understand what I'm saying, I hope :.) The fragrance of the candle starts once you light the candle. Other candle's frangrance starts after 5-10 minutes...so I used Archipelago's LUNA for my migraines or after I finish my midterms and finals....I hope this helps."
4,Good candles,"I have tried most of this Archipelago line. All of this line burns evenly, distributes smell nicely, and lasts a long time. Overall I recommend this candle brand and think they are almost worth the price. If they were 20-25% cheaper they would get 5 stars.My favorites-for a fresh soft ""anytime"" scent: Sakura, Pacifica, Dubaifor a warm rich, deep (and strong) perfume like scent experience I like Madagascar, Kashmir, Havana, Stonehenge.For floral enfleurage is nice (but VERY floral)A few in the line have what I experience as a ""chemical"" like quality, and I cannot tolerate the smell of them. It seems to be mostly with the ""fruity"" ones: Paramour, Cote du Rhone, and Fiji all have what comes across to me as ""fake and air freshener like"" sharp scents. I gave these away after a few burnings because I found them offensive to my nose."
2,Story Not History,"Though my favorite story ever is the story of Jesus, I really thought this movie would be more about the history and places where Jesus walked. It wasn't. It was basically the story we read in the bible with pictures of those places He visited. I know the story, but not much about the places he went, themselves."
2,Too long and very boring,"Some years ago I remember watching the video ""Where Jesus Walked"" by Pastor Jack Hayford. It was wonderful. Now that my second grade son and I are studying Israel in our homeschool, I decided to see if Netflix had the DVD. This is what we rented, and it is NOT the same thing. The stuffy British narrator nearly put us all to sleep. The dramatizations were overdone and some are not even fit to be seen by children. I do not recommend this DVD."
2,too big for most chairs,I got this because of my back injury that has been really bad again lately and I sit a lot in my computer chair. The one big problem with this backrest is that the curve of it sticks far from the chair making the space where your legs go is cut to half of what it originally was. My back feels better but now my legs hurt because they hang over the edge too far because of the curve of the backrest.
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,"This product was not right for me but, it appeared to be sturdy and well made. I am a big guy, 6'6"", 250 pounds and although the lumbar pad is adjustable, I just couldn't get it postitioned where I needed it to be. I have friends that have tried this brand and love it. Although it did not work for me, the return was a simple and pleasant experience."
4,"Tale of sex and hate, southern fried","I hated Raine's fishing books. I thought he was arrogant, spoiled, and unable to take accountability. However, they were well written. I thought I would purchase his novel to see what he could do in another form. Let me tell you what I think he accomplished. I think he was able to provide an image of life in the South during the depression. In offering this to the reader he offers a tale that focuses on how sex, love, and hate can drive someone to decisions that are less than admirable. This reminds me to some extent of what O'Hara does, but set in Pennsylvania. I love these kind of novels even if I do not agree with what the characters are doing. He paints a great image and reconstructs how the characters found themselves in the positions they did, and what they thought at the time. All in all, a great book."
2,"OK song, good B-sides","In its singles from ""Monster,"" ""New Adventures in Hi-Fi"" and ""Up,"" R.E.M. settled back into a pattern of releasing live tunes as B-sides instead of unreleased tracks. These are decent; ""Electrolite"" might be better live than in the studio, and ""Man on the Moon"" always is a good listen, though some listeners may have heard many live versions of it already. ""Suspicion"" isn't one of the best tracks from ""Up,"" though, and its release as a single perhaps shows the weakness of the album it came from. This single is good for completists, but unnecessary for everyone else."
1,This book blows,"I suggest that the publishers package this book with a caffeine IV and a recipe for crystal meth so that the reader can stay awake. I have never encountered a book more full of worthless drivel than this one. The author really needs to find a life and not waste his time writing a gargantuan book that no one in their right mind will ever or should ever read. He turns the Space Race, an inherently interesting topic, into a story that makes getting a root canal seem fun. But alas, I must be off to finish reading this piece of garbage. MEDIC!!!! I NEED SOME CAFFEINE!!!!!"
3,how to win game of chance,"good book, for the lucky stars in your eyes, if your lucky, otherwise some tidbits you can use to hit the big one."
4,Essential Little Book!,"If you're going to play lotto or do any other kind of gambling, then you need to know what your lucky numbers are and lucky times to make your move. You need to get a numerology chart done for yourself too. I made my own with the help of a good numerology book.But Ken is a really spiritual guy and he knows what he's talking about. I'm really pissed that this [...], but I suppose that it's because it's still an essential book and it's out of print. So be prepared to spring for this used book if you can find one."
5,Piece of Khani Cole Soul is a *Lifetime* of Memories,this cd is outstanding...Khani has a wonderful voice...this cd is spectacular.. her first track *Lifetime* is very wonderful with a brazilian sound..*Things I Do* is one of my favorites by her along with *If* which she sings about a lost love.. *Trickin*is very groovy.. and the two interludes are named after her children Aria and Erin... if u dont have this cd u need to rush to the record stores and purchase it..
1,What A Dog!!,I rated Places 5 stars. This album was terrible. I could not believe the difference between Places and Lifetime. Be sure you listen to the sample songs before buying this album.
2,"Cracking the Lsat with sample tests on Cd-Rom, 2000 Edition","The book is pretty much useless on the arguments and reading comp, it seems to give a good overview on the logic games. The biggest and most annoying flaw is the CD. Don't use it. I went through a full test and a half a test; afterwards, the CD couldn't compute my score and froze up my computer. The CD has repeatedly been a thorn in my LSAT studying experience."
1,"Eye-yii, yii, yiiii","This digital article highlights all that's wrong with medical journals: they are outrageously expensive even in the online universe.In an era when major mainstream periodicals put most of their content online for free, medical periodicals continue to restrict access to subscribers only.These restrictions form a huge barrier of entry to patients of uveal melanoma - which is why this digital version seemed so promising.But there's no digital revolution to be found here. Instead, look to digital points of entry via comprehensive and free websites such as the National Cancer Institute and See A Cure for sight and life-saving information about eye cancer."
4,great coverage of bowling basics,"a really good book for the beginning bowler. Covers the basic 4 and 5 step approaches, how to line up your shot and so forth. I owned this book years ago and lost it, so I bought this new copy. Its useful to review from time to time, particularly if you game is going poorly and you can't figure out why. Its a ""back-to-basics"" coverage of the topic."
1,Horrible sound! - Don't buy! - Must read!,"If you want 1980s style ghetto blaster sound then get these.I got these because the reviews were good but man do they suck! Seems like they got the Ohm's wrong or something. Basically you can't hear the tweeters! As if the tweets are at 32 ohms (headphone) and the drivers are at 8 Ohms. I put these side to side with my Yamaha NS-AW150BL speakers and it's night and day. Get the Yamaha's! The Yamaha tweeters are crisp and clean and the Pyle's, well I can't hear them. The Pyles frequency range is just the muddy mid range that bothers most people ears. I thought maybe Outdoors they would fill better but it's just not the case.I have probably 10 different sets of speakers (being I have a pro recording studio, home theater, car stereos) and these aren't even close to my worst other set of speakers. If they paralleled 1 or 2 more tweeters into the enclosure it may sound ok.All the others raters are tone def."
5,exceeded by far,I had a need for replacing two speakers for my home theater system. It is not a high end but a mid level set up. the rear speakers (wireless) had fallen and one was suffering a blown voice coil. I searched for replacement components to replace the insides of the box. no luck. It appeared these speakers would be slightly larger than mine but should be drivable. These speakers brought the rear sounds to life! I can now hear tiny detail;s clearly and music on the unit fills the room providing more defined mids and high's. Am I pleased? Yes and so will you be!
1,Do not waste your time!,"So, I bought these to use under my gazebo.I tested them out before installing and they sounded fine for what I wanted them for. Went to install them and found the little screw slots on the base were not installed properly, so it was not possible to insert the screws for installing.I was kinda bummed because I wanted them in for Memorial Day party but it wasnt a big deal. Had Amazon send me a replacement set.Got the replacement set - SAME ISSUE.2nd replacement set - SAME ISSUE AGAIN!3rd replacement set - @%$!@#@$@!$#!So yeah, they are all going back and Im getting speakers from someone else."
3,The FCA's gonna bust someone up,"A stand-alone Ferengi episode. But this one had a message about organized labor. (and I played Donkey Kong most of the episode). If you haven't seen it and you like Star Trek, than watch it. Pros: Worf's move to the Defiant. I think it's more of an in-between story to explain certain changes on the station for the upcoming battles. But as a fan, I have to give this 3.0/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Dr No(ah),"OK, so this episode is another photonic episode, which we get frequently throughout Trekdom. My guess is that the writers run out of ideas, or need development time for the main story arcs. Although this episode is interesting and lighthearted, I think the acting is pretty bad. 3.1/5 Stars. Skip this one unless you have to see every episode. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Kira's having Miles' Baby,"Another decent episode from Deep Space Nine. This is a tale of Quarks, so if you were just looking for the series storyline, you can skip to the next one. But it is a nice story that gives character development to our favorite Ferengi. Nicely directed considering it's a filler episode. My favorite part is the side story with Kira and the O'Brians. But one question remains, is Garak's contract still on? 3.9/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,DS-9 Season 4,"The episodes were great, just as I remembered. DVD picture quality superb.It is a shame that the manufacturer was so cheap when supplying the covers of a quality DVD. The end flaps fell off when I opened the package to watch the 1st disk."
2,Good and bad,"There are many episodes I like, but a few get on the seccular humanist soapbox and preach Euthanasia and Sexual Promiscuity. beware of letting Children watch the epuisodes ""Rejoined"" (Which presents aberrant promiscuopus behavior as if it were normal) and ""Sons of Mogh"" ( A cleverly disguised-and poorly argued assisted Suicide message."
5,A great series to see without interruptions,Story and character development are much better without interruptions for commercials. Seeing it this way is almost like seeing a new series.
4,very good,The item came on time and was what i wanted. One of the disks had a small scratch in it that affected viewing (it was a new item) but was easily remedied with a disk cleaner.
4,Dukat is Demoted for Ziyal,"Can Dukat get Kira to help him? Watch and find out. If you don't know what that meant, then go to Season 1, and watch most of the series up to this point. Although there was a lot of excitement, I didn't think the acting was up to par, and I was just waiting for something more exciting to happen, but never did. However, do not skip this episode. It's important to several key storylines. Pro: Klingon Bird of Prey. 3.8/5 Stars on the Trek-O-Meter. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,The kiss was good...,"...but tha'ts about it. I saw this ending coming the second I found out the situation (even though it seemed WAY out of Dax's character) All in all it's a very unnecessary forced feeling episode that should have never made it past the pitch. I'd say skip this one, because the chemistry just wasn't there and it has nothing to do with the main story."
2,"disappointmenting boring, + too much Worf, not enough Garak","This was a very disappointing season. While there were some good episodes, there weren't many, and the bulk of the season ends up being pretty boring. It was certainly a huge mistake bringing Worf into the show. DS9 should have had a chance to be it's own show with it's own characters and stories, but the over-presence of Worf (and character's like Deanna Troi's mother) really bring down the show. There is deinately not enough Garak in the show as the aliens (Quark, Garak, and Odo) are the heart of the series. The whole Kingon war element was really pretty slapdash as well, they should have stuck with the Dominion storyline."
1,Can I get that 45 min of my life back,"So many things that didn't make sense in this one, it has nothing to do with the main story (forgettable and skippable), and the ending is sloppiest I've seen in a while (did a 4 year old write that conclusion?). It wraps up so fast that you're left thinking....""wait was that it?"". I must mention I am a bit biased, I feel it's only right that people reading this know I am not a fan of Lwaxana Troi AT ALL (she is half of the plot in this one). I watched this for free as part of my Amazon Prime membership and I still give it a 1/5; I fell bad for ppl that actually paid for it."
5,Deep Space Nine - a 10,"As a lover of all Deep Space Nine episodes, I was thrilled to get this 4th season - just as great as seasons 1-3. I am looking forward to purchasing the remaining seasons as soon as I can."
5,Tear-jerker,"This story made me cry when it first aired in 1995 and again in 2012. I don't know if it still touches me this much because I too lost my dad when I was a teenage boy. It struck me that my experience of watching this again after 17 years mirrored the storyline. Just as Sisko had disappeared and was thought dead here he is again, alive in my home, not having aged a day. Forget about all of the other philosophical reviews. All that this episode is really about is the power of LOVE.Thank you Michael Taylor for writing this. Thank you to all of the actors for their emotional performances."
3,"Powerful, Emotional, Ethical Shortfall","*Spoiler*Another episode with the excellent acting and powerful dramatic abilities that I've come to expect from Avery Brooks, though one that ultimately strains my ethics once again. The genius of this episode is in its plying of our empathic emotional strings. Everyone wants the boy and his father to get a second chance. It's wrong that a man as unselfish and honorable as Capt. Sisko should be wrenched from his son's life. However, this episode raises a few disturbing questions about the worth of every individual human life.In Sisko's parting rebuke of his dying, aged son, he was right. If you believe in the inestimable worth of every human being, the quest to reunite his father with the past did not and could not have justified the taking of his own life. His father was visibly disturbed by his son's action, he knew that his son should have let go and lived his life; to see Jake come to that end broke Sisko's heart."
1,The cheapest (in quality) item I have ever bought,I ordered these to wear for a fun rally at the school I run. They were so cheaply made they were breaking as they were being put on the first time. I had to duct tape my zipepr shut to hold in the air. We got 5 minutes of use out of them and thankfully that was all we needed. I would NOT buy these again. Buyer beware.
1,Not meeting expectation,"I was planning on ordering this for a college event at my University and it was dreadful. The Material was not what i was expecting, the Fan had to be kept running, which i had to use duct tape to hold the button to keep continuous inflation. With the Fan running all the time it has this UNBEARABLE ANNOYING sound all the time! I am 6'2 and it came up to my knees, the buyer should have specified that it wasn't adult size in height. The fan had to be kept running to keep it from deflating completely. Even then, you can't move without it deflating A LOT. I tried to make it funny to try and move my belly to see my feet, and i pushed with such little force, and it deflated the belly then had to wait about a minute for it to refill. You can't move fast in it, Cant wrestle in it, and you will be disappointed. Do not buy this product. I would never make this purchase again.If you want to blow 40 bucks for a product you'll only use for about an hour tops, go ahead."
3,Decent Suit,"The suit works well if all you want is the sumo costume. However, after several uses the zipper broke. I had to use velcro to make it work. Also, you can't put any clothing over it because the fan is not powerful enough."
3,Got your money's worth...,"I had a few friends that purchased the same one and the fan stopped working (overheated). We had to at the last minute improvise with balloons stuffed in the costume. I hope they returned the costume and got their money back. But all in all, my costume made it and we won the Halloween contest at work!"
4,Shipped Fast great deal,This costume is hilarious. However be very careful putting it on and off my son already put his foot thru it.
2,VERY Poor quality yet fun item,"The fan broke within 10 minutes. we rigged a fan of our own up to it and it worked fairly well. despite the poor construction, the costume was very fun."
2,Poor quality,This costume broke before we left the house. The fan didn't inflate the costume. Overall cheaply made! Very disappointed. Wouldn't buy
1,cheap,"The zipper came broken, and it was like impossible to return it so I finally gave up. Not worth it.."
1,Sumo Costume,"This was the worst use of money ever. The suit doesn't stay inflated, and the zipper on the backside will break off if/when you try to use it. There's nothing good about this costume."
2,was disappointed,I was disappointed in this costume. The matterial was not what expected. It did not expand like I expected. The fan was not strong enough to keep the suit expanded eought to look good. And the fan switch was to hard to turn on and off. It should also be on the back side of the fan so you could reach int better. Also you should put a height size on this and I bought one child sumo costume and adult size costume for my daughter but the child one was too short and the adult one was to loose around the arms and neck and ankles to keep the air in. Also should give more detail about the costume. Show where the fan goes. I was disappointed in the pocket for the fan because again it let to much air out so the costume would not expand as much as it should. Again very disappointed and I will be returning them.
2,The fan is too noisy,"I bought this costume to use as our mascot THE SUMO BOY and it worked really well, but the fan which inflates the costume became too noisy and annoying after a few times I used it. If you're going to use it only a few times it'd be a great buy."
3,Half worthwhile,"I purchased two of these items. The fan for one was defective, and I was unable to buy a replacement in my area. The fan for the other worked just fine."
3,they work for 1 time use,"I ordered 5 of these. I needed 4 and bought one as a spare in case something went wrong. We had 5 short skits to do with them and wound up using duct tape to hold themn together. One battery backs did not work and a second you had to hold together to get it to work (made for a one armed sumo). Dont plan on getting in and out of these, once you get it on, if you take it off have some duct tape ready for the zippers."
4,good quality,Excellent Quality set. Used by many pastel artists especially since you can get a large selection of colors . I recommend the set of 96.I always have these in my pastel box
1,Poor shipping,I was really unhappy. These are high quality pastels and Amazon couldn't bother to package them correctly. There was no padding and quite a few were broken. All pastels are SOFT.
4,Bit pricey,"The product is a bit expensive for what you're getting. While you get plenty of colours, the sticks are small and easily break in the mail; a few of mine were broken when I opened it. Despite all that it IS hard to find pastels that can be used with charcoal without having mixing or texture issues so it is worth it for those who love their charcoal works."
4,My Summer Story,"Was in good condition & watched it & had it was fine. I did want want the DVD, but it was my fault, I did not notice it was VHS, but I do have a VCR. I would order from this person again."
2,This movie is ok!,I saw this movie some years ago..it seemed better then than now. It was till funny in parts. Grodin overacts and is literally the worse actor in the movie...
2,"Nice Movie, But A Huge Disappointment","This follow up to the brilliant 1983 classic ""A Christmas Story"" is a pretty disappointing affair. The movie does not hold the same magical quality and nostalgia as the holiday movie. Kiernan Culkin and Charles Grodin taking over for Peter Billingsley and Darren McGavin, were no match for the pitch perfect performances of the latter two. Mary Steenburgen takes over Melinda Dillon's role as Mom. The film deals with Ralphie's young childhood in the 40's. Kind of bland and boring. If your a ""Christmas Story"" fanatic like me, you will be disappointed as well. It's not a bad movie at all, it's just not what one would of hoped it would've been following the previous classic."
4,Nice addition to the Christmas Story saga,Another in the Christmas Story series of films. My wife and I have added it to our DVD collection. Very pleasant to view.
4,Summer Story,"My husband and I saw this on a cable channel and howled. This was purchased as a birthday gift for our son in law who loved the original Christmas Story, however I don't believe he has watched this spinoff yet. We are ordering The Christmas Story 2."
4,Funny movie-but it was not Christmas Story!,Loved the previous movie-I think everyone did-especially if you grew up during that era. This one is ok-I think it lacked the 'feeling' of the Christmas Story-perhaps with other actors it would have better
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS CLASSIC.,"I THINK THAT THIS MOVIE IS JUST ""OK"". TO ME, IT DOESN'T COMPARE AT ALL TO THE QUALITY OF ""A CHRISTMAS STORY"". I WOULD PROBABLY BUY THE MOVIE TO ADD TO MY DVD COLLECTION, BUT HAD ALL OF THE ORIGINAL ACTORS/ACTRESSES, WITH THEIR TALENTS BEEN IN THIS ""SEQUEL"", THEN IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN DYNAMITE ."
4,"Christmas Story sequel, Sort of.","This is a funny movie. I was skeptical at first. If you like The Christmas Story I think you'll like this one, even though all the characters have changed. This is why I only gave it 4 stars."
4,Pleasurable. Family oriented entertainment.,"The story of the Parker family continues. My family enjoyed this film, though not as much as the infamous Christmas story. From the blasting music to the early morning fishing, they related to the turn of events in the story just as if it had happened to them."
2,Mediocre film.,"Putting aside that ""A Christmas Story"" is a classic, this follow-up is still not that good. The roles are miscast-especially Ralphie and Randy as the kids playing them are too young and don't act very well. I love Jean Shepherd's stories and have re-read the written forms of them many times and still enjoy them. Some of the major problems with the film:1. Tried to cram in too many of Shepherd's stories into the plot and made all of them shallow and poorly developed.2. The stories they did put in were significantly modified and made silly/stupid instead of staying true to Shepherd's writing.3. Stupid stereotypical Hollywood characters--cheesy Hillbilly neighbors, the ""bully"", Ralph's friends turned into nerdy runts.4. What's with the dog Barkley? Another attempt to make the movie ""cute""?I bought and watched this movie hoping for a decent portrayal of some favorite stories. After one viewing, I'm going to toss the DVD and stick to Shepherd's books!"
5,It really is Indiana in the 1940s.,"Charles Grodin isn't Darren McGavin, but Mary Steenbergen is great as the mother. The movie does a great job of picking up Indiana in the 1940s -- the visit by the tax assessor itself is worth the price. I'm from the southern part of the state and Jean Shepherd was from the north ('da region,' as Hoosiers would have it) and he was a little older than me -- but he has the language, situations, etc., nailed again, just as he did in ""Christmas Story."""
3,More wit from Voltaire,"A quick read with the wit typical of Voltaire - Not in the same league with Candied, but few books are."
3,"Not the best Starbuck, but excellent battlefield desciptions","I have read the whole series and this book is not the best one. I think that the first two books- Rebel and Copperhead are better than the last two- Battle Flag and The Bloody Ground.The battlefield scene desciptions are very good and alone make it worth reading. I just was not impressed with the character development, especially for the new ones introduced in this book.I do hope that Mr. Cornwell continues the series, I would hate to see it end at this point."
2,A story going nowhere--slowly.,"Sometimes one feels powerless when reviewing a book. Already, the chronicles of Nathaniel Starbuck, a Yankee fighting for the Confederacy during the American Civil War, are proving as popular as Cornwell's previous creation, Peninsular War hero Richard Sharpe. True, the historical period is nicely evoked and the battle descriptions are accurate. But the characters are all too simplistic. We never understand why the upstanding Starbuck is fighting to preserve slavery, why Southern blacks seem content in their place, or why all Rebels are nice and all Northerners nasty. The story of how Starbuck's leadership redeems a punishment battalion also goes nowhere--slowly. Yet whatever I say, I am sure this book will sell in great numbers. Go figure."
4,A good historical fiction story,"Finally, the 4th installment of the Starbuck Chronicles. As I have reviewed in the other 3 books, I find this series thoroughly enjoyable. Cornwell uses many of the same characteristic traits in Nathaniel Starbuck as he does in Derfel of the Winter King, and Thomas of Hookton in Archer's Tale.I like the way he builds the characters. They are not entirely perfect and they have lapses in judgment, but I find myself rooting for them even in the midst of suffering or trials.I found Bloody Ground to be the best of the 4 books, but not quite a 5 star (maybe a 4.25). If you are a fan of historical fiction, I am recommending you read this series. Cornwell has done better stuff, but you will be entertained nevertheless."
3,The Nathaniel Starbuck Chronicles: Part Four of Four,"In the final book of Nathaniel Starbuck's Civil War adventures, he is given command of a collection of cowards, thieves, deserters and murderers, known as a punishment battalion. Starbuck and his men team up with General Robert E. Lee's army and join Stonewall Jackson at Harper's Ferry, where the Union garrison is defeated. Then they move onto Sharpsburg, beside Antietam Creek, infamously remembered as the bloodiest single day of the war.The Battle of Antietam will be the final showdown for this conclusive novel of the renowned Nathaniel Starbuck series. As to whether Starbuck triumphs or dies, you'll just have to read the book and find out.Originally published on November 4th, 2002.Go to BookBanter ([...]) for over five hundred reviews and over forty exclusive author interviews, and more."
4,the best book in the series,the best book in the series. Cornwell's series is excellent. I went out and bought a histroy book on the civil war. This series really peak my interest in that era
3,Formula series but still a good telling,"Despite the fact that the entire Starbuck series seems to be a rewriting of the familiar Sharpe series novels, one cannot help but like these books. This, the final addition to the series, is perhaps the one I enjoyed most. Yes, its more of the same but the battle description seems longer in this one than in the others. The theory for how McClellan came to have Lee's plans is interesting and draws in the guerrilla aspects of the war not often touched upon. Cornwell's books are not ""great fiction"" in the sense of telling a story with deep significance beyond the story, but they are finely spun tales that entertain and that is of value in itself. But do not expect something original in characters - these are Cornwell-templates fleshed out in slightly different situations as with his other novels."
3,Better if you are a Yankee fan,"This book was published in 1989 and is a history of the 1949 Ameican League pennant race, won on the last day of the seaon by he Yankees. There is much discussion of the Yankee and Red Sox players of that year, particularly of Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams. Much of the book was derived from interviews with the players 40 years later, but they seemed to remember well what happend. Since I am not an American League fan and since I have always hated the Yankees the book could have been better but there is a lot interesting stuff in the book, and it provides quite a good insight into the thinking and behavior of players in 1949, when they made a lot less money than players do today"
4,"About the times, the people, the baseball","This book doesn't just talk about baseball, but explores the psyche of the men who played and formed the game. An incredible history lesson of the times that will give a deeper understanding of just how great and how heartbreaking baseball really is.Even if you aren't a fan of the Red Sox or Yankees or if 1949 isn't a part of your life, this is something for any student of the game. Of course, baseball is the main theme but it also ties in how much our culture is and was affected by it. And if you just want to learn more about DiMaggio or Williams, Halberstam offers great insight into the legendary players.Even today, when it isn't the most popular sport in America, baseball still has sociological implications on society. I am definitely getting this for my dad."
2,"Good book, bad shipment.","The book was ordered as a gift, and I'm told by the party that received it that it is a first edition. The seller listed it as being in ""great condition,"" however, the book arrived in a damaged package with a damaged cover. While this may very well be the fault of the party who shipped it, the book was sent by media mail - the cheapest possible way - and this is more likely where the blame lies for the book being damaged."
4,The amazing 1949 pennant race between the Red Sox and Yanks.,"Halberstam has an incredible knack for telling a story and integrating anecdotes into the work as well. This truly was an amazing book, Halberstam did a masterful job."
2,No Real Magic,"Halberstam was a brilliant man whose writing only occasionally reflected that brilliance. His sports books are weak; this is probably the strongest one, but that is not saying much."
2,Past due date,"Maybe if you were alive and following baseball then this would be interesting. I loved DH's other books on Korean War, Fifties, JFK, Media...but this was a total clunker, boring from beginning to end."
5,A fun little read.,Lot's of typo's but they don't distract from the stories. Some parts are a bit strange due to translation issues I suppose but it's still very entertaining.
2,cover?,"I don'y know about everyone else, but I bought this book as a gift for my sister and a huge partof the appeal was the beautiful cover. But that isnt what I recieved.... i got the book, hardcover, but its plain grey with no writing even on the front. Im very disappointed in that."
3,Not well formatted for the Kindle,"the stories are wonderful. a few of them match some of the stoies we heard while living in Okinawa with the military.HOWEVER, I cannot give the Kindle version a 5 star like I would like to, because the formatting is absolutely horrendous."
4,Omoshiroi,"The stories in this book were very interesting and I enjoyed them. However, I do think it would be nice if the free Kindle edition contained the original illustrations. The same is true for most, if not all of the free classics for Kindle. But of course it is free."
2,Lost in translation,This was not what I expected it to be. Some of the stories dron on forever and never get to a point. The translation is very odd and there are numerous typoes. What I had really been looking for was a Japanese mythology book and deicded to whet my appetite with this. This book was not anywhere near as enjoyable as the Japanese fairy tale book I had as a child.
3,good insight into culture,"If you love Japan and the culture, this is a good book to help you understand some of the deeper cultural values of this society."
4,A very interesting read .,"I thought that Northanger Abbey was a capturing read and yet, if you have not read any of her other novels you would find the language hard to grasp at first. I think that she describes Catherine Moreland's naivity very well and there is a very pleasing ending."
5,Makes Gaudi's Works come alive!,"I have been obessed with Gaudi from the first minute I landed in Spain a month ago. I have been to msot of his major works and am finding my way to his lesser. This book has been an amazing companion to the journey. It is amazing to sit and read about Park Guell while sitting in Park Guell. The author gives you the entire story of each work, and the social, political, and economical contexts that surrounded Gaudi's works and life. I read the book at fast I as could and now am reading it again. If you want to learn not just about Gaudi but the Modernisme movement and the socio-politics of turn-of-the-century Spain, there is no better book than this one."
2,See it in person,"Preparing myself for a trip to Spain, I wanted to get some great background on some of the sights I was planning on seeing. I thought this book was going to prepare me with some incite on Gaudi's character and what was going through his mind and life during the construction of his iconic work. However, Hensbergen's biography reads more like a architectural school essay than a look into the man that was Gaudi. It was confusing, it jumped around way too much, and failed to give me the experience I was looking for. I recommend seeing these genius structures in person, they will speak to you far more than this book ever did for me."
4,soundsgreat,"the speakers were really cool looking and soud really great too, didn't take but a coupel of daze to get here. I was really inpresed with every thing. I would recommend them"
3,You get what you pay for!,"For the price they are great. I must admit I tried to cut corners and buy cheap speakers expecting big full sound. These speakers will work for those on a budget or who don't care about high quality sound. They aren't the worst I've heard but aren't anything comparable to a high end brand. My advice,save for better speakers!"
1,don't get hooked on the yellow color,"I looked at the color of the speakers and read the review, it all looked ok. next i remember the name or maybe it just sounded cool, pyle like pyle drivers, anyway i got one, thought they were sold in pairs, but i only needed one so it was ok that they sent one. but when i hooked it up i was dissapointed, the sound was crapy, but they were cheap, hey... maybe you get what you pay for lol."
3,Well.,"I hooked it up to 100 RMS and listened at a low volume. Afterward, I put them in my car only to find that they were blown. The coiled melted. Just in case you were wondering, you only get one per order. It didn't say that when I bought it, but I was expecting one. Could be good if you can get them to last."
2,Just OK,"I mounted these in an acoustic suspension cabinet to replace the old woofers.These sound fine, but the bass is not deep, and the cones distort & pop at about 8 Watts.These are just OK if you want to replace speakers in a kids room."
2,ok,didnt expect much but i was a lil disappointed.not enough bass for me and they distort with the stock cd player in my 01 sierra.i would suggest going with something better.but they were cheap.
3,Not What I Expected,"This bag looks SO MUCH better online that it did when it arrived. Faux croc ix exactly what you get. The pink color faded with little time. I was so disappointed. I did, however, greatly appreciate the suede lining which was very lush and included a removable pouch. This made up for the exterior to some degree."
4,Mobile Edge Limen Milano Handbag,"I like this bag a lot. The compartment for the computer has little foam bumpers in the bottom which are on top of a layer of foam, which is the safest design I've seen for the bottom of a bag or backpack and most do not have that. I like the little pockets, but there shoule be more of those. They have about 4 on one side of the bag, but they need some on the other side. The only complaint I have is that it should be just a little thicker as it is hard to get your stuff in and out. The zippers unzipping farther would probably help also. All in all a good bag though, and this was by far the least expensive website I could find."
2,The Picture is of a Different Item - Totally different shape,"Not happy with the material of the bag for price. The picture is not a picture of the bag I received. The inside will allow me to do what I need to do. If I had another workbag, I would send it back. Back to work tomorrow after a long vacation tomorrow. Color is a shiny PEPTO bismal pink. Need real picture of their inventory item."
4,"a pictorial history of the fire engine, volume 1","I search for "" a pictorial history of the fire engine, volume 1 and 2."
3,Nice Cover,I purchased the cover for my son's birthday. The price is right but the gauge of the material seems a little thin. Only time will tell if how it holds up under outside weather conditions.
2,Review of Conair EP1CS Women's Single Roller Epilator,"The epilator has a great design, is easy to use but is to small and not efficient enaugh. It takes ages to perform a perfect epilation on all the body."
2,Waste of our money!,We bought this when our son was born because there was not much to choose from where I live. It started falling apart as soon as he could actually start reaching for the toys. He loved to watch it when he could not move around alot. That did'nt last long. It is so light weight that he pulled it over on himself. The side bar broke and the pieces came off. We were unable to repair it and there were sharp pieces sticking out where it broke. It is not a safe baby toy. My daughter had a similar item by fisher price when she was a baby and it was a lot better. I would not recommend buying this. Spend a few more dollars and get something safe.
3,Not enough bang for your buck...,"I bought this when my son was between 2 and 3 months old... he was slightly amused by the face on the spinning globe, but it didn't keep his attention long. The only thing that it was good for were quick diaper changes. It is made cheap and we've had to change the batts. about every 4 uses. And now, at 7 months, my son picks the thing up and bangs himself in the face with it. He likes to mess with it now, spinning the toys on the sides, but honestly, I don't think it was worth the $30 we paid for it."
3,Battery Hog!,"We registered and received this toy for our son. Overall this is an attractive toy, but due to alot of use, we typically had to replace the batteries every other week. Also, the mat is not lined and we had to provide some additional padding for comfort. I would not purchase this toy for my child or for any other child."
1,fell apart,"I bought this and my son who is 4months looked and it and played with the things hanging for the top. Then next thing I know one of the bars on the side broke right in half, I was not very happy cause my son could of got hurt from somthing like that."
1,Lasts for 5 minutes,This product is good if you only want your child entertained for about 5 minutes. It is cheap and not worth the money and only plays one song continuously. There is only one switch so if you want the lights on and the world to turn you have to listen to the only song there is over and over. You can't even turn the sound down. My daughter gets bored with it very easy.
5,"originally i didn't necessarily care for it, but...","...i have learned to love it, because my daughter loves it so much! the music always captures and holds her attention, and when i call grandmom's house to check on her, i'm always told about how much fun she's having with ""starman"", one of the soft hanging toys. she also likes to stare at the included blanket mat draped over the side of the couch. my only complaint? it's loud. really loud. i wish i could turn it down. instead, we've wrapped a receiving blanket over the speaker to muffle it a little."
3,Mildly Entertaining,"My daughter is 5 months old, and will play with this for all of 20 minutes before she begins to fuss-- I assume from being bored. Also, the things that twirl on either side are made of very hard plastic and when she gets super excited, she's hurt her hands on them from swatting too hard. I would agree with other reviewers that the mat for this is super thin and scratchy. The up side is that the star and planet dangling over head did encourage her to reach and grab."
1,~*~*~*~*!!!BEWARE!!!!~*~*~*~*~,"This is an ok enough toy for when they are really tiny, but once they start sitting up with support TAKE IT AWAY.I had my DD sitting in her boppy in front of this toy, I turned around for a min. and she had fallen sideways and was sufficating because she had fallen such a way that her head was on one side of the ""A"" frame and her body on the other, her windpipe was being crushed by the support part of the frame that goes across the ""A"" frame (not the part with the dangling toys).Please be careful and I'm going to write to the company and to the dept. of consumer affairs regarding this issue, if I would have left the room for more than a minute my baby would have been dead."
1,Returned!!!!,"If this toy was like $5 it would not have been so bad... my son was not paying it any attention....I returned it immediately & got him a baby tad, which he loves!"
1,BORING!!!!! Don't waste the money!,"I really thought this gym would be cool when a friend got it for the baby, and it was for about 30 seconds. It only plays one song and the toys are unamusing and difficult for baby to access. My son liked it for a little bit but soon he was bored and irritated with the same playing over and over. Now that I have heard how breakable the toy is, it will be taking a trip to the dump."
1,Don't buy this,"It is so disappointing!! It only has ONE song and it's kind of like a music box type sounding song...it chimes. And the song is less than 10 seconds long and then it just repeats OVER and OVER. There are only 3 lights that flash and they are just little squares blinking. It's not entertaining to my baby and it was a waste of 30.00.. maybe for 15 it might be worth it but I'm not even sure of that.And the ""play mat"" is not a mat at all... it's an extreamly sheer peice of fabric."
4,My Son LOVES This!,"I received this before my son was born and have used it from the begining. This has actually kept him entertained for hours! He even likes it without the music and flashing lights. I've hung different toys from it for variety. I only gave it 4 stars because the mat it comes with is useless...very rough and scratchy. I wont use it. And, as with many baby toys, I wish this came with a volume control."
2,nothing great,"The Light and Sound Galaxy Gym and Playmat is nothing special, but I guess it got the job done. For 30 dollers I wish I had gotten something else. The playmat was very thin, so when he was still really little we tried to put a blanket under it, he still got bored or uncomfortable because he started crying in about three minutes. We waited a few months to try it again and he still seemed bored with it. It would hold his attention for short periods of time, but was nothing special. We finally sold it at our garage sale for fifteen dollers, and put the money toward a walker. I would not reccomend this product."
1,NOT A GOOD BUY,"This toy is cheaply made, not fun or entertaining, and does not hold the attention of any child that I know 0-12 months old. My son didn't like it nor did my neice or nephew. I would not recommend wasting your money on this product unless you need a toy to take up room. =("
2,Not funny for the money,"First off, my baby couldn't stand the music! He would start screaming when I would turn it on. I bought this when he was 1 month old. He wasn't impressed with it then and he still isn't to this day. He is now almost 6 months old. The mat is WAY TOO THIN! I never used it. I always used a separate blanket instead. If I would have known it wasn't as good as it looked, I would have used my money for something that will actually keep his attention!"
2,Cheesy junk,"I bought this gym, and was very disappointed. I thought I'd save $10 over the fisher price one, but yet again, you get what you pay for. The ""mat"" is only a thin piece of cloth you can almost see through, and as soon as baby moves, it gets all bunched up under them. The gym has two cute toys, but the whole thing is pretty cheesy, and it only has two settings for the music...on or off, and it plays the same song over and over again. I don't know who got aggravated first, me or my baby."
4,Great for Babies beginning to reach and grab,"My child is 4 months old. He was getting frustrated by his Fisher Price Kick and Play bouncer and Classic Chorus Singing Stars Gym. He would try to reach and grab the toys but the toys are positioned so that he can't reach them. Also the shapes made it difficult for him to grab. I first saw this toy at my child's day care. He was placed under it and to my amazement he instantly began reaching and grabbing for the toys. It is high enough so the bar is away from him and the toys are not resting on his body. The mat is useless but the gym itself is great for the price. I also purchased linking rings and added them to the dangling toys so he had more things to grab which fit perfectly in his little hands. The music is a bit loud but if it annoys you, you could always wrap a cloth around the area to muffle the sound. This is really a worthwhile investment to encourage your exploring infant."
3,Mediocre toy alert!,"I was given this at my baby shower and thought it would be great for my daughter. One of the other online reviewers mentioned the scratchy mat it comes with. I agree that the mat is useless. The music is fine, initially. After a while, you realize the volume is too loud (and there is no way to turn off the sound AND have the lights on). My daughter loved the lights. The dangling toys aggravated her. At first she couldn't reach them with more than her finger tips, but once she could grab on, the frame would move with her. I had to put the toy away. I would suggest a playmat where the frame is attached to a softer mat. That's what worked best for us."
4,The Prince of Tides will Wash Over You,"This is a dramatic, moving movie with great characters and wonderful plot development. Barbara Streisand plays a wonderfully real psychologist who seeks to help Nick Nolte's character deal with his troubled past in order to help his future. It is very moving and will leave you thinking about it a week later."
1,Horrible!!!,This is a savage ruination of a wonderful book. I don't know why Pat Conroy let Babs ruin his masterpiece...but ruin it she did.Read the novel. Skip this mess.
1,Poor Image Quality for Rental,"This is not a review of the movie, but a review of the image quality of the video when viewing as a rental. The image quality was blurry -- like watching a 3D movie without the glasses. It was not a connection issue since the audio and actual streaming were fine -- no jerky images or buffering problems. I've never had problems with Amazon's On Demand services before, so I tested other videos that I had purchased or rented in the past -- no problems there, so it was definitely the quality of ""The Prince of Tides.""I emailed Amazon.com about the issue and was promptly refunded the rental fee.This review is not meant to deter people from watching ""The Prince of Tides"" since I did not actually get a chance to watch it. This review instead functions as a warning of technical problems that Amazon will hopefully soon resolve."
4,"Great film, unthrilling DVD.","I loved the book, I loved the film. I think Streisand beautifully captured the essence of the book's emotional intensity. For me,the scenery in the film was exactly as I'd imagined it based on Pat Conroy's descriptions. HOWEVER, having waited eagerly for the DVD, was very disappointed to find no special features of note (unless you call trailers and filmographies 'special features'). I know I've seen a 'Making of...' somewhere before and assumed that it would be included in this addition. As thrilled as I am to own this movie on DVD, don't buy this thinking there are extras. You'll be disappointed."
3,"An enjoyable movie, but still a disappointment","I think few people who, like me, had read the book by Pat Conroy would be satisfied with the movie version. On the positive side, it was well acted, well cast and the script did not stray too far from the novel. However, so much was left out that the power and drama of the novel were lost. Particularly disappointing was the fact that Luke and Savannah, two of the main characters in the book, barely featured in the movie. Focussing so much on the romance between Tom and Lowenstein, only a secondary storyline in the novel, may have made the story more straightforward but also more ordinary. Nick Nolte was great as Tom and I did enjoy the movie, but after reading the book and knowing what the film could have been I feel a bit disappointed. Probably this book would be better adapted for a mini-series, where more time could be allowed to develop all aspects of the story."
3,A big soap opera,"Though released in 91, this looks like 1981. Nolte was still young enough to be appealing, but his hair in this one isn't his best look. Barbra is just terrible. Dated. Her acting ability is rough, at best. The clothes haven't worn well over the years. Neither has the hair. Ths plot is ridiculous. I've never heard of a psychiatrist quite like this one: she spends months trying to figure out what's wrong with Nolte's sister, by talking to Nolte? This doesn't happen in real life. Pat Conroy's novel was hot stuff way back when, but it hasn't stood the test of time. The scenery of Beaufort, SC, is gorgeous, however. Also, like many movies of its time, this is too long by 30 minutes."
2,Good-Looking but Vacuous and Overripe,"Barbra Streisand has made a very good-looking movie, and competently directed a very good cast, so this movie isn't a total dud. The problem lies in the story itself. It's simply too unbelievable, formulaic (the ""childhood trauma"" at the center of the film doesn't have any resonance, it's simply a glibly Freudian attempt to tie the narrative together), and full of overripe rhetoric that cannot disugise the vacuity of the tale.The one redeeming feature in this film is Nick Nolte's SUPERB performance. This is far and away the best performance I've ever seen him give. He deserved the Oscar for this."
3,Happy with it,"Happy with it more because it's a good movie, nothing I really paid for.Very emotional film, but very good."
3,A brillant story with less than brilliant cinema,"As a whole, Prince Of Tides appears, at first glance, as a more than decent film: the acting of both Nolte and Streisand is very, very good, with Streisand turning in one of her best roles which she might not be expected to play. The storyline is excellent, with appropriate twists and turns and twists.The problem with the film is this: it builds itself as a large, cinematic film, with it's grand music and it's seamless editing, and long sequencing. And the film simply is not that: the music and editing are especially innapropriate, tinting the film to grand cinema, while it is actually rather dark and trimmed. After building to an anti-climactic ending, the film suddenly ends, leaving the viewer with unresolved ends (Barbra and her husband, their son, Sally and her adulterer), and wanting more. Had the film been created on a much less nostalgic and grand scale."
1,"Great book, horrible movie.",This movie has very little in common with the book. The love story between Tom and Lowenstein was only a very small part of a really outstanding book - Luke was hardly mentioned at all and the Callenwolde incident(s) were glossed over.Why oh why did Pat Conroy ever allow this movie to be made??? I would give it a negative rating if I could...
4,In the brumes of the alcohol!,"Sensible and poignant melodrama about an alcoholic. With a sumptuous reference frame, Streisand made possibly her finest masterpiece.Penetrating script with a towering acting of Nick Nolte."
2,Made for TV,"Only the Nolte and Streisand characters are well-drawn; the rest are stereotypes. The dialog attempts to be moving, but is more often cliche. Even the climactic revelation has an ersatz, made-for-TV quality to it. Not a bad film, just not a good one."
5,"Loved the book more, but...",I LOVED the book and bought this as VHS about 3 times (kept wearing it out) until I got it on DVD. It gets the basic gist of Conroy's book and is well done.
5,Great Movie,"Babs and Nick Nolte are great in this movie! I ran across ""The Prince of Tides"" on television one day and knew immediately that I had to get this movie. I even read the book that its based on by Pat Conroy. A family, haunted by the ghosts of a painful secret, is in danger of losing everything. Their road to redemption lies in the telling of events hidden long ago. To get the full effect of this movie, read the book! Great experience, a movie you won't regret buying!"
4,Good Movie,I saw this movie years ago and really enjoyed it. Then a couple of weeks ago I read the book and couldn't believe all the stories that were packed into that book so I wanted to see the movie again. There is no possible way to squeeze all of that book into a movie. It would have to be a mini-series. All in all though the movie was as good as it could have been I think. Definitely worth watching.
5,Intense!,I really enjoyed...not necessarly an easy read...deep...moving..much better than the movie..delving into mental illness and destructive family dianamics...and results of abuse..
3,Prince of Tides,A very emotive movie with brilliant performance from both Nick Nolte and Barbara Streisand. Streisand did make her character very saintly by giving up what meant most to her to allow some stranger to be happy.
2,Boring-OK Maybe I didn't get it,"I loved ""Red"", ""White"" and ""Blue"", but this was to slow and icky-weird for me. Is she a puppet? Why is there a flasher? Why should I care?"
2,Disapointment Came In A p.o. Box,I recieved this movie with excitement only to watch it ith utter disapointment. The movie was completely detached. I prefer to feel the characters not just observe them.This movie follows the life of two women who are seemingly the same. However I thinkt he idea for this movie is better than the video itself
5,La double vie de Véronique,"One of the best! The music is sublime, the acting profoundly touching and the story is magical in its sadness and beauty. The entire mood of the film is captivating. Kieslowski is a genius and his art is still around to tell the story. If you loved this film you must see the work of another genius: Nikita Mikalkov`s ""les yeux noirs"", (Dark eyes)"
2,BAD TRANSFER,"I had the original DVD and the cinematography was spectacular--this Blu-ray transfer is bleached out and flat. The original was luminous, this is dull and without depth. It seems to have been made from a copy of a copy."
5,A Thousand Bird Sites,"I am a casual birder, and found this book to be very valuable in increasing my knowledge of birds and birding, not so much for the books content itself, but what it directs you to. It is full of web sites devoted to birds, and gives a review of each site so you don't waste your time going to a site you may not be interested in. It is a valuable resource, not only for beginners, but for the advanced birder as well. I highly recommend it."
2,Cardone WP,"Well unfortunately for me this leaked right out of the box. I have had problems with other new products not performing out of the box before so I was not too surprised. Fortunate for me, I purchased a WP gasket repair kit at the same time and just replaced the rear seal on my old pump that was leaking. The return process was quick and painless and I was credited my full expenses."
3,"Jar good, blue liquid - all gone","It looked cool when we first purchased this blender jar, as the old glass one broke. The cool blue liquid is almost gone now, but that might be because we put the jar in the dishwasher (Oster recommends hand wash only). We still use this blender jar almost 4 years later, so it will last a long time."
2,A lot of hype,"I got this thinking it would be nice to mix drinks in and keep them cold longer. I've tried it twice, and both times the blue gel ""melted"" even before I got a chance to use it. I kept it in the freezer the night before and it spent about an hour in the fridge before mixing the drinks. We used 2 bowls, this one and the one that came with the blender and found that there really was no difference between the two. It's no wonder Oster has discontinued this item."
4,double the reds,"with double red filters I got very nice results. It is a pleasure to work with this film. Deep blacks, white halos, just perfect. My favorite B&W film with an infrared effect. Recommended for fun and artistic shoots."
4,"Dated, but still valuable","If you want to see what the Caribbean was like half a century ago, in the 1960s, from a sympathetic liberal European perspective, then this book is for you. Mitchell examines the region pretty thoroughly, with an unjaundiced but hopeful eye, and considers its political and economic prospects. Today, it is of useful historical value to the scholar looking back at the early days of decolonisation, as well as the policies of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations."
2,no links in Kindle edition,"The Kindle edition has NO hyperlinks in the document. Since there are 41 chapters, this is a problem. It gets better.When you search on the word ""chapter,"" or one of the Roman numerals associated with each chapter, none of the 41 chapter beginnings are found, because the chapter heading is an IMAGE, not text.I'll try other editions, and if needed, a download from Mobi, and report back on whether I can find a version of this book that can be used with a linked Table of Contents."
5,Hard Bop moved into contemporary lyricism with this group,"Clifford Brown - a name not well known today, but the master of the trumpet in 1955 and 1956 - until his very premature demise at the age of 26 in an auto crash.This fellow played the trumpet like he copyrighted the term ""stretch-out"". He blows away the constraints of bop. How he manages to rise to the heights of lyricism, especially with Max Roach keeping time with his lock-step snares and tom-toms, is beyond me. Listen to how he makes musical space in his playing! There is nothing remotely like him prior to 1954 - but Lee Morgan and Freddy Hubbard would never have played like they did without him."
5,Very Best of 70's Radio,I received the CD in a timely fashion. It was in brand new shape and plays very well. I am pleased with the complete transaction.
5,Good Stuff,"Polk Audio is an excellent product. I began with these 4x6 speakers and completed the picture with a 6.5"" component set of the same series. Just a great sounding speaker."
4,Half the price of crutchfield,"Crutchfield recommended these for my suburban, found them here at half the price. Good sound, great price and easy to install"
2,Defective Speaker,"When I got this speaker, I thought that for sure I was getting a great deal. This speaker is supposedly a really good brand, has good quality, and had a great deal. But unfortunatly, one of the speakers is not working well at all, and may be blown out. Does anyone know where you can find the warranty? One of the speakers works fine, but the other is all screwed up. I am very disappapointed."
2,Review,"The product I ordered does not seem to be a Closet Maid! It does not have the name on the side like the original had.What I received looked like it but it seems the back ""lips"" are slightly longer than the others were.Is there a certain way to install them? There were no intructions wit the order.Would appreciate an answer.Jeanne Brandt"
4,Good product,I use these hooks in my daugther's closet and the one she had broke. I was not able to find these in the stores and this one works great.
2,There seems to be a problem,"We bought two ClosetMaid SuperSlide 6' by 12"" inch shelf kits. The product looked good and the price was right. When we got it home, we found the hardware for hanging the shelves was incomplete. (ClosetMaid does not, for example, supply mounting screws, only ""pin""s for attaching the shelves to walls.) We took extra time and care and hung the two kits in about 2 1/2 hours.One fell and then the other. I'm sure they would hold a light load, but anyone paying to ""upgrade"" a closet is expecting to come away with some serious storage.We went to a home improvement center and purchased another $20 in hardware and rehung the two kits. They won't come down now, but I would have liked to have instructions and hardware equal to the reality of the job."
1,"My original hooks broke, too","The only reason I'm even buying new ones is that it's much quicker/easier than installing a whole new bar. But I'll definitely be doing that at some point. And it won't be a Closetmaid. Unfortunately, this brand is sold at both Home Depot and Lowe's."
4,ClosetMaid Supports for Hanging Bar,"Product works well for hanging support bar and is easy to install. I would suggest using several spaced evenly along the bar to give it more added support.Was very surprised when one of ours cracked that Lowe's, Menard's, & Home Depot didn't carry the supports locally. Was pleased to find that I could still get the parts on the internet."
1,Disappointed and returned ball.,"If this is an official NBA game ball then I'm confused. Years ago, I had a NBA leather ball, and this is not even close to being similar. Okay, granted if it takes time to break-in, I wasn't inclined to be patient because it also had a erratic bounce. Two fellow ex-college hoop friends that I play with also encouraged me to return for refund as there opinion was also negative."
2,For some reason the ball I got felt different than others.,"i've always wanted to have an nba game ball, so after seeing the price they had for one here i had to get one. but i seem to feel disappointed. If you see this ball at the store it feels hard slick like great leather. but to my surprise this ball didn't feel like that at all. I guess it is because it the limited edition classic ball, and Spalding used the rest of the leather that was left good, or bad to produce these. the ball feels like the pebbles are big, the patina feels cheap.It seems like the breaking in process would still not help it that much. If you get the balls that they used now that have the new design but still made of leather you can totally tell how different they are. Well I wont play with it, but i guess ill keep it for aesthetic value since its a limited edition classic ball, but i wish it was good enough to play with, guess i have to shell out $99 for something worth playing with."
3,"Interesting idea, but confusing characters","This mystery begins with an interesting premise. An unsolved mass murder five years before has profoundly affected the people living in the nearest small town, some of whom act peculiarly on the anniversaries of that event. Drivers see a woman next to a disabled car, but all of them are too preoccupied to stop and help. She disappears, and her body later is found in the ocean. Good start! But the author confuses the story by introducing too many characters, including potential suspects, who do not emerge clearly as individuals. Because there is no trail of evidence for the reader to follow, the ending drops out of the sky."
2,Confusing Characters,"The intrigue of what happened to ""Crissy"" is there but the back and forth of so many characters made it too confusing. Frustration made me drop the book."
4,Pleasantly surpised - very good mystery,"I just happened upon this book and bought it because it sounded interesting and I was looking for something different. I am happy I picked it up. It was a very good mystery that had interesting and believable characters, and a wonderful atmosphere. I liked the two main characters and their background stories. Everything came together very nicely and it was an enjoyable ending. I will definitely be reading another one of Muller's books. My only complaint was that the narratives were a little choppy at times, but it was only a minor flaw in the book and didn't significantly affect the overall feel of the book. I highly recommend it to all murder mystery lovers."
4,WHY IS THIS MOVIE NOT ON DVD????,"I find it difficult to believe that this film, which is very entertaining, has NEVER been on DVD... Would ANYONE please issue this on DVD???"
5,Yummy Adam,I am giving this movie 5 stars because of the scene where a shirtless Adam Ant kisses a shirtless Micheal Pare right before stabbing him in the head. You have to see it!ADAM ADAM ADAM!And the rest of the movie is ok too.
1,Merely a collection of familiar letters - no focus,"The authors have just collected a bunch of old letters, letters which we have all seen before in ""Nicholas and Alexandra"". There is no scholarship here - no focus or insight or shrewd analysis. This is simply a lazy job of throwing together as many letters as the authors could find. Nothing new. A poor job"
5,A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra,"A Lifelong Passion: Nicholas and Alexandra is definitely one of the best books on the Imperial Family! Told through the diary entries, letters, and memoirs of the Imperial Family themselves and some of their closest friends and family, this book definitely gives you a clear insight into the lives of Nicholas and Alexandra."
4,A excellent book,"I read this book during a vacation so I had a long time to go over it. I was happy that the book included letters between Nicholas and Akexandra from after they meet at Sister Ella's wedding in 1884. I have never read letters from that period in their courtship before. I was dismayed that most of the pictures were painting. Instead of the thousands of pictures that the family took of each other. I like how they put in the book not just letters from Nicholas to Alexandra but from their children. And from people that were invlved in their lives. Also I enjoyed how they were the authors and that the ""authors"" of the book gave no comment until the very end. I enjoyed this book very much"
4,Bob's a Blast!,"This is one of my absolute favorite Bob Hope movies. The supporting cast is wonderful, and the plot is light-hearted and entertaining. I could watch this one over and over again--and have."
3,It;s really not that bad,"Why this film was a commercial failure and is critically loathed is beyond me. No, this is not one of Bob's best, not by any means. But Hope himself is in fine form, and while the film is uneven, there are enough good one liners and sight gags to satisfy his fans. Hope is ably supported by an ace supporting cast, including Phyllis Diller, Dick Sargent, and Jeffrey Hunter. Just sit back, relax, and laugh."
4,Classic Comedy,I really like this movie. It had been a long time since I had seen it. Couldn't beleive I found it on DVD. The old Bob Hope movies are fun to watch. I want to get Paleface next.
5,Bob Hope movie,Bought this last year for my mother in law. We all enjoyed watching it.Great quality.Great to do business with! Thanks!
1,Buyer Beware,"Less than a year and the volume died. Since under warranty, Phillips told me to send TV back and they would send a new one. The ""new"" one was a crappy looking refurished TV that didn't work. Customer service no help. Frustrating experience."
5,How to identify true spiritual Masters,"This book has a very helpful list of criteria on how to know which spritual masters are truly ""godmen"" and worth listening to. For example, a true Master never asks for anything from his/her followers; a true Master is self-employed, and does NOT make a living from donations. This book really opened my eyes. It helped me see the difference between paid Preachers (however well-intentioned)and true Masters. Highly recommended."
4,Residential Cabling,"I attended the Pilot Training course of the same name taught by BICSI. The book very closely follows whatis in the course, and is required reading if you intend to take the BICSI exam. As technical books go, it is very easy to read. I would recomend this bookto anybody looing to get into the Residential Cabling Market."
1,smoke and mirrors,"Item was misrepresented in the orignal listing. It showed the entire item and said ""SINGLE ITEM ONLY"". That was fine with me as I only wanted one as a gift. Nothing was said about this being a middle plate of the item which is all I received. Now the wording ""FOR REPLACEMENT"" has been added."
1,Cost Me 15 dollars extra and both Amazon ans Honeyville don't care,"Well apparently Amazon sells this for Honeyville grain and Amazon charges 15 dollars more than honeyville sells it for at thepr website, neither Amazon nor honeyville are willing to refund any money. I only found this out when I was looking up the company to find out why it was taking so long to receive the oats... The oatmeal may be good but this DEAL left a bad taste in my mouth..."
3,"Awesome product, cheaper from the vendor",I love this product. But similar to the last review I found it was $15 cheaper directly from the vendor. Why should there be a difference?
3,disappointing,"Bringing these two together should have been a no-brainer. Smiths gritty funk provides a perfect counterpoint to Montgomerys cool elegance and precision. When the production allows them to play against each other, the album works the way its supposed to. The trouble came when the producer decided to clutter things up with some overwrought orchestration, or some bland, then-fashionable latin tracks. The production adds nothing, and takes up valuable time that these two great artists could have spent playing together."
5,An essential jazz masterpiece for any collection,"This is one of greatest jazz recordings ever - the greatest jazz organist, the greatest jazz guitarist, the cream of the crop of jazz studio musicians and a superlative big band score.While Jimmy Smith had a prolific career spanning decades, Wes Montgomery died not long after this recording of a heart attack. This and A Day in the Life are his two great recordings. The recording quality of this is superior to the later. And this has more pure jazz improvisation.There is something indifinable about the mix of these two geniuses, but this recording really cooks!I have had this recording in various incarnations since it came out, and never get tired of it.I am listening to it now and it is 1,000 volt sound!If you don't have it, get it."
5,Every guitarist should own this,Both Smith and Montgomery cook on this. The interaction between them is very intense. Oliver Nelson's arraignments are very hip. This is one of those recordings where everything is right. The whole thing just swings the most. You can't go wrong with this one.
4,Great deep fryer if you need to cook at two different temps.,This is a great deep fryer if you need to deep fry at two different temps (like fish and french fries) at the same time. Also keeps the flavors separate. I upgraded to this from an expensive single DeLonghi unit and haven't used that fryer since.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I BOUGHT THIS FRYER IN NOV. AND USED IT FOR THE 1ST TIME NEW YEAR'S EVE. I FRIED 1 BATCH OF FISH AND IT WORKED OK. I TRIED TO USE IT THE NEXT DAY AND IT WOULDN'T TURN ON. I HAD A LOT OF FISH 2 COOK, AND I HAD TO COOK THE FISH ON MY STOVE. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!....."
1,Burst into flame,We had this fryer for about 2 years. The elements are finicky it turns off by itself. The main problem is with the contact switches on the back not being depressed correctly.Today however was far worse as one of the heating elements burst into flames from the inside. Overall the product is 1-2 stars except for the bursting into flames part.
1,power connectors stopped working after a few uses,"The magnetized power connectors on this product stopped working after a couple of uses. Therefore, the deep fryer will not heat up (or even stay on) unless we actually hold the power connectors in place. We wrote to the product manufacturer THREE times to ask about replacement parts and/or fixes for this problem. We got no response at all. We also tried telephoning, but they do not pick up their telephone. I would stay far, far away from this product. I am currently in the process of buying a substitute and this one will go in the trash.By the way, it is true that the number disappear on the dial nearly right away. I fixed this by painting over them with clear nail polish immediately upon the product's arrival, but they are a bit smudgy anyway."
3,FRYER,I find having two separated baskets especially useful since you can only use one at a time rather than have a large pot of oil and only use one basket in it. I use it often and have found that it cooks perfectly if you follow the timing in the manual.
2,Fryer,"I bought this deep fryer because it had two separate fryer baskets. Initially I thought it looked good. After a few times using it I found out differently. When I wiped the oil off the area around the controls, all of the numbers that tell me the temperatures wiped completely off. They were some kind of ink that was not permanent. Also, when I put the tops back over the fryer, they would not fit. They are made of cheap plastic and once they get near anything warm they warp and will not fit. I HIGHLY do NOT recommend this fryer to anyone. The connections in the back to the electrical cord is loose and does not fit well. Do yourself a favor and look for another fryer other than this one."
1,It's a shock hazard,"I purchased this for my Aunt & Uncle. My Uncle was an electrician for GM for 40 years & after he checked this out, would not even let my Aunt plug it in! He declared that it was a shock hazard. If you use both sides at once it takes 3000 wates which most homes can't handle. Be caefull if you purchase this. We returned it, still waiting for reimbursement."
1,"This deep fryer is Sorry, No good",the unit come on and go off while cooking. electrical cord in the back broke out. I rate these fryers a 0. my review is concerning the Maxi-Mati EDF-3060 Elite Platium Stainless-Steel 6-Quart Deep Fryer.
3,Good value for the money,"Good value for the money, but as I had read in other reviews, the numbers wear off of the temperature nobs if you're not careful and you can't tell what the temperature is set to."
3,ahhhhh,"i think it was an okey book, however the purpose of reading a novel is to escape your everyday life, i feel that the storyline was good however, she could have done alot more to improve the book i love history, but i coulden't help thinking 'enough already'."
2,Hard going,This book was difficult to read and falls far short of her previous works. Although I am familiar with all of the historical references and the speculative ones as well I was falling asleep while trying to get through (and keep track of) all of the extraneous information. The plot was really thin and weak. I respect Ms Brandewyne as a writer and have read almost all of her books but this one is a real disappointment. I was tempted to quit reading it several times but refused to admit defeat!
4,great book,"I thought this was a wonderful book. The plot is interesting and quick paced (sometimes I was overwhelmed by the rapid evolution of the characters' thoughts). Although the romance part was practically nonexistent, the concept behind the book was enough to keep me reading. I was blown away--really. I just finished reading the book and can't get over it. The last few sentences really inspired me. I applaud Ms Brandewyne for taking a tricky concept and doing all the necessary research in order to make it work. I am in complete awe."
3,Long Winded,"The basic outline for this story sounds intriguing. However, the end result is a long history lesson which drags on through the ages. I have always enjoyed Rebecca Brandewyne's work but this one fell short of the mark. While the history imparted throughout the book could have been interesting and added depth to the story, in the end it just ended up being tedious reading and not worth the money."
2,Not her best,"This book cannot compare to her previous work. I found the characters uninteresting and somewhat flat. The villians were amateurish and not at all intimidating. I am not a professional reviewer by any means, but I read about 15 books a month--I gave up on this one 3/4 of the way through. Yawn."
1,My first and last Rebecca Brandewyne book!,"After reading all those glowing tributes on the book jacket I thought I'd found a winner. It's opening chapters were intriguing but soon after that didactic boredom set in.Real people do not talk like that! The main characters sounded as if they had somone's thesis in their hands and were quoting from it. The book is like a cross between Stephen Hawking, Erich von Daniken and James Bond. Brandewyne used the love story merely as a frame for some pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo."
5,"Lots of ways to play, keeps their interest","Sorting, stacking, counting, lacing are just some of the ways my two and four year boys play with this. Grandma is a retired 2nd grade teacher and commented on what a fun and educational toy it is. Good value."
3,BUZZARD ROOST RUSTLERS AGAINST FLAG SIX SPREAD,"Galloping Jack Johnson rides a pinto horse leading a jug headed mule named Joker right into a range war against rustlers. The rustlers are headquartered at Buzzard's Roost and are led by a bandit called 'the buzzard'. Narrowly escaping both beating and shooting by the Flag Six outfit, ole Galloping Jack now thinks he is more than ready to tackle the ""impregnable hideout, Buzzard's Roost"".With all the humor available, W. F. Bragg writes another entertaining saga of the open range when men were men and mules were contrary and their owners even more contrary. Wait till you meet Old Lady Bloom and her daughter Rosanna.Another interesting book from William Frederick Bragg, 1985 style.Let er rip!Semper Fi."
2,deeply disappointed,"as a long time manolo aficionado, i was deeply disappointed in colin mc dowell's tribute to one of the greatest artistic geniuses of our time, manolo blanhnik. as geniuses go, blahnik's a very complicated man, and i feel that mc dowell doesn't begin to do him justice. i came away from the book wanting to know more. besides that, i don't feel the photographs and sketches were necessarily indicative of blahnik's best work."
2,"Boring with a Capital ""B""","... I bought this book. I have a foot fetish, shoe fascination. I make shoes. I love this man. I came away from this book feeling that this man was very shallow.The photos were disappointing. Those of us with shoe obsessions won't be satisfied with this book. The shoes shown aren't original; the manner in which they are shown isn't either.Perhaps I was too hungry for something as original as Manolo."
5,Feed Your Manolo Obsession....,"As a woman and a fan of shoes, I'm here to tell you that you can't get any better than Manolo Blahnik. His creations are sexy, stylish, and comfortable. And thanks to Sarah Jessica Parker and ""Sex & the City"", they are all the rage. But there is one tiny problem...they are also VERY expensive. For those of us that can't afford to run down to Neiman Marcus and slap down $600.00 for these sexy stiletto's, there's ""Manolo Blahnik"" by Colin McDowell. The pictures in this book will take your breathe away. You'll find yourself salivating over everything from linen mules to toe-ring slides. The book itself is more like a work of art than a book about footwear. It's also interesting to learn how Blahnik creates these beauties.I suggest this book for fans of Manolo or those who wish they could afford them. Beautiful book! It'll make you go out and buy a few pairs!Gennie Bailey-Rogers"
4,International and personal S.F. mag,"This is my new favorite SF mag. On one hand, it has the best of new voices from around the English-speaking world (Canada, UK, Australia, USA), so you get a lot of different takes on the genre. On the other hand, ""Neo-Opsis"" isn't produced by some corporate publishing entity. It's just two people, a husband and wife team. She does all the artwork, which is professional quality, and he writes articles and very quirky editorials. It's a small press science fiction magazine."
5,One of the best biographies about Roy Rogers & Dale Evans!,"Chris Enss's, The Cowboy and the Senorita: A Biography of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans is one of the most heart-warming and well written biographies about the ""King of the Cowboys"" and the ""Queen of the West."" The personal stories of Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are very well crafted, and the author is able to capture the essence and soul of these two wonderful people. Ms. Enss is articulate, animated, and amazing when she read excerpts from her book at a Barnes & Noble store. Fans of her wonderful book should really meet the author in person. I truly hope an audio version of this book gets produced soon."
1,This sucks!,"I just bought this at Best Buy where it's exclusively sold. I was expecting ""Live Performances"" as the cover art states. EH! WRONG! This DVD was so bad. At first, I thought this was when they first recorded the songs for the album. But the extra rap verse from Sebastian on ""Way I Are"" wasn't in the recording that made it on ""Timbaland Presents Shock Value"". Also, their lip movements didn't always match their vocals and in ""Way I Are"" performance, D.O.E. Is scratching a vinyl record and there is no scratching sounds. This tells me Timbaland and others faked the performances. I rightfully deserve my $4.99 Plus Tax back for this Wrongfully advertised DVD. If you are ever at Best Buy, avoid this at all costs. Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go whine like a baby to Best Buy. AVOID AT ALL COSTS"
3,From Back Cover,"Josie's Scheme for Seduction:1. Sneak into Adam's apartment2. Slip out of her clothes and under the sheets3.

But his first priority is to convince Josie that there's nothing like the real thing....From The Wrong Bed series."
4,Gorgeous journey,"To comment on a few things not mentioned in other reviews--Gide developed a love of nature very young, and his eye for the subtle--light, air--is wonderful. Most see this as a book set in North Africa, but note the descriptions of the Alps--one can almost hear the cold, crisp air. Although his relationship with Marceline takes a back seat to his own inner voyage, I found his struggle to love her, while at the same time being pulled in an entirely different direction, compelling. His urge to continue traveling at the end, knowing deep within himself that it will kill her; knowing but not knowing how ill she was throughout, was frightening. How different a work from explicit, modern novels that hit one over the head like a ton of bricks!"
4,"Oh, the Guilt! Oh, the Gide!","I loved ""The Immoralist,"" and that surprised me. I read it on breaks at work and couldn't stop myself from sneaking peaks even when I wasn't on break. Gide reminds me of Flaubert and James. He's someone I want to read when I need to feel guilty for being a human.Take a gander at my full-length reviews at litbeetle.com!"
3,"Interesting, but ultimately quite tame and a bit drab by todays standards","I'm really not sure what to make of this. Mostly because I couldn't tell if Michel's nascent attraction to young men was just homosexuality or if it was more about some weird, romanticized ideas about youth with a bit of cheap oriental exoticism thrown in. It's also hard to know how to read people who basically spend all of their time being deathly ill and sulking. Are they repressed because their unhappy or just unhappy because they're repressed? I don't know. It's an easy read, and while it might have caused a scandal when it came out, by 21st century standards it just seems kind of weak"
4,Scary,"I probably took it more in the way of, ""How could he leave his poor wife,"" etc., but it's one of the only books I've come back to for a second reading even after getting it the first time around. Absorbing."
1,"slow, tedious work","Andre Gide's The Immoralist is a lethargically slow, tedious work. Somehow I don't really care about the ""journey"" the pompous, spoiled, dullard Michel goes through. None of the characters are interesting, they are all upper class French bourgeoisie who do nothing all day but drink wine, dine and frolic with little Arab children. Andre Gide is writing about his own debauched ""life"" in Africa, but it isn't ""shocking"", just trite and shameful because it is just as hypocritical as the upper class French bourgeoisie."
3,"Sensual, but more about self-discovery.","If you see the title and think you're going to get a sticky, homosexual romp or decadence in droves, go look for some erotica. This is intelligent, and yes, sensual literature, but it is not erotica in the sense that you use it for one handed reason. It's the sensuality of freedom, of thought, of doing what one knows one shouldn't. It's not the sensuality of body... though it's highly suggestive in places.What this is can be called the unfettering of a spirit, the freedom given to a man by a brush with death's wing. It's not perfect; the book (as well as Michel himself) has a number of flaws, but it's still quite a good read."
3,an interesting book,i have read this book and i found it so interesting in the beginning but when i completed it i found it a strang book because the way which written by was a new language to me. but in the end it is a interesting book to a famous writer .i recommend it to any reader looking for interest and philosophy.
2,A GOOD MOVIE IF IT WEREN'T EDITED,"This is just referring to the DVD:I was waiting for this DVD to come out because I loved this movie when it first came out. I rented it from a video store a few years back and really enjoyed it. Well acted. Good premise. Not to mention, Kari Wuhrer is hotter than ever.Yet, the DVD is a huge disappointment. It's edited! The video tape I rented was an unedited unrated version. THIS DVD IS NOT! It's the R-rated version.Otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars! I'll never understand why they edit these movies? Ruins them.Sex seems to be the only criterion for the MPAA to give out NC-17 and decline ratings. Yet, violence has no limit."
2,This movie is horrible,"The acting and premise for this movie is absolutely pathetic. The movie isn't very ""revealing"" of Kari so i'd advise you to spend your money on something other than this garbage."
1,No No No No...,"...People didn't REALLY give this dreck positive reviews, did they? It's a joke, right?I watch a lot of movies, and I'm very forgiving of the bad and middle-of-the-road ones. But this tested even my patience. What a horrible waste of film, time, and talent!I'm glad the ""Plot Synopsis"" above listed this as a ""romantic comedy"". I kind of thought it was supposed to be funny, judging by some of the music that accompanied some scenes, but I wasn't sure. There were no laughs, no giggles, not even any slight smiles elicited by this. The only time I reacted was when my jaw dropped in amazement of how bad this movie was! It is only 88 minutes long, but they were the longest 88 minutes of my life!Bad acting, unbelievable plot and characters, and boring direction add up to...a lot of nothing.If people watch this kind of stuff just to see Kari Wuhrer's assets, as appears to be the case, well, that is just sad."
4,"good picture/sound, but DVI port should have been HDMI instead",It is a good tv overall for the price. the only annoying thing is that an HDMI port is not available. Most sources not output HDMI rather than the older DVI.
3,Buying from Amazon,"My first TV would not always turn on when started. I contacted Phillips for an exchange and was told that it would need to to be shipped to them for repairs and would take 15-20 business days, which is not very helpful when you have just purchased a brand new TV. I contacted Amazon direct who exchanged the unit for me within days, they were extremely helpful.Now I have a working TV, the on screen displays are a little small, otherwise it is a good LCD TV."
1,Use a magnifying glass,"Regarding the type size of the channel number display and the closed captions: They are both barely readable unless one is sitting closer than five feet from the screen. Their support says that there is no remedy, as the type size is fixed. But Philips type size is no more than one-fifth the size of our old Panasonic. If Panasonic can make their type legible, why not Philips?If I had known this I never would have bought this product. I am most distressed."
4,SPACE,"PERFECT TO LITTLE SPACES. GREAT TO PUT IN THE WALL. PLEASE CHECK AND BE SURE WHEN YOU BUY A WALL MOUNT BECAUSE IS SOME HEAVY TO REGULAR 26"" WALL MOUNT."
4,"A viable option for kitchen/office, etc and a PC monitor too","Overall, it's a good deal for what you get compared to what you spend. Although, the lowest volume is too high, the remote is way too small (can get frustrating), and the on screen channel display is way too small...but if you can overlook these minor infractions, then this is a good buy...makes a great 2nd tv for the kitchen, office, bedroom...probably not the best choice for the living room/great room...I purchased because it was the lowest priced flat panal that also served as a PC monitor and had a good image when viewing it in the store. I would probably purchase again..."
3,"Philips 23PF5320 23"" Flat Panel Widescreen LCD TV","Great price for what you get, but the quality of hte product isn't all that great. The picture isn't as crisp and clear as you would expect. I thought the sound was fine. Overall if you have to pay more than $300 it's not a good deal."
5,Increditble flat panel,"I love this tv. I have it in my bedroom and it's perfect. I connected it to my Comcast HD box and the picture is stunning. My advice is get good top dollar connections. I haven't put it on the wall yet, still awaiting the mounting bracket. The sound is awesome and can be quite loud but with some adjustments, it's perfect."
2,Poor service from philips,MY tv needed repair and i was told to shipped it to arkansas which cost me $46.I did on april 24. i receive a refub on mAY7.It worked for 5 min. i shipped it back may8. Philips did pay for the shipping but as of MAY 28 i am still waiting for a replacement.I was told they should know something by JUNE1 I will never buy another philips product
4,Awesome TV,"I've very pleased by this TV as it has all I needed. It can act as a TV a computer monitor and has enough input to do all this without troubles. The design is great. And switching between video formats (4:3, Widescreen, Superwide, etc) is easy. The image quality in VGA is also very good. And finally it was delivered fast and well by Amazon."
3,Decent tv - especially considering price,"I am overall pleased with the TV. I love connecting it to my laptop and do regularly. Has quite a bit of trouble handling very dark scenes, but so do a lot of lcds. My main problem with the TV is the remote. It has stopped working several times, and as of two days ago no longer works at all. I have tried to talk to several people at Philips about this, and it looks like I'm going to have to buy another remote."
3,Good picture poor volume controll,I bought this TV for use in my bedroom some time ago. The TV has a great picture but from level 1-10 on the sound there is no change in volume which is a nuisance. At this sound level the TV is hard to fall asleep too and forget it if you don't set the timer and an infomercial comes on in the middles of the night because it's going to wake you up.My only other complaint is turning on and off the TV. If you turn the TV off using the button on the TV you can't turn it back on with the remote. To me this is very strange and took a little getting use to but now it's not a big deal.I have had my TV for almost 2 years and use it in the kitchen now because the of the volume issues but over all it has been a good TV.
3,Not a Horrible TV,"I have had this TV for 2 years and find that it was not a horrible purchase. The picture is excellent when playing DVDs, but somewhat grainy with regular cable (a problem with other TVs as well). The remote is tiny and it is next to impossible to see the buttons in low light (so buy a new remote. . .). The channel images on the screen are also too small and the time delay when switching channels requires patience. The worse part of the equation is the volume. As others have said, the volume on setting ""1"" is too loud. Guess it is good for the price, but I wouldn't buy again."
2,"Well laid out, but obsolete","Very well organized, the explanations are well written. HOWEVER nothing past Win 3.1."
4,For those who whant to study art,"Its an advanced study in psychology and anthropology, for those who study visual arts and want to understand the visual perception across the cultures. Very interessant and content very complete. But is a relate of a pratical study, may be boring for some."
1,Stanley Wiater BOTCHED IT,"5 stars for stories 0 stars for editingAs you all know, Richard Matheson's stories are the cornerstone of what has now become modern horror literature. His simplistic way of injecting the very brunt of terror into the hearts and minds of so many people has solidified his true and unequivocal greatness, and who I believe should be bestowed first class treatment in the compiling of his unparalleled stories into 3 volumes. Yes, great idea, but poor execution. The word edit obviously lost sufficient meaning in the pen headed mind of Stanley Wiater: the dumb moron who apparently didn't edit worth a s**t Matheson's stories. It's misleading and deceptive to print edit upon a book with myriad typos and misspells and, then, put a price tag on it. What a shame...J. R. Rebuck"
3,Great Stories - Poor Editing,"I have read all three of the volumes in this collection. I must say that this collection is so poorly edited, that I find it impossible to believe that it was edited at all.The excellence of Matheson's work has caused it to be melded into the very culture of America. Some of the stories here were adapted to serve as episodes of the television series, Amazing Stories, Night Gallery, and the Twilight Zone.The poor editing of this collection, or, rather, the lack of editing, certainly does not pay a worthy tribute to such a great and culturally significant writer."
3,Not quite what i expected,"I was hoping for something a little more substantial from the description of this book, which turned out to be a slim volume at best. I was searching for some compendium of the Algonquin wits, and this was I'm afraid, about it! It is not without some merit, however dissappointing the selections are (small snippets - more anecdotal than anything else - representing the range of most of the members of the Round Table). It does offer a decent over-view of the prime members of the club with some literary tastes of their various and varying works. The playwrights are not that well represented, but some of the lesser know news reporters are. An appetizer waiting for a delicious feast to be compiled someday."
5,Books by Mail,"When I shop online for a book, I look for the best price first. Then I want to know that the description I find matches the book that will come to me in the mail. Not having sold, I can only imagine that there are lots of ways to describe a book, and then package it securely. This book arrived exactly as described. It was in very good condition, having been packaged in such a way that even the U.S. Postal system did not damage it. Shipping costs were reasonable, as was the price. This was a lesson in selling and shipping a book in such a way that the customer will look for this seller again."
4,Lego girls,My 41/2 year old daughter loves this new system from Lego.We discovered it earlier this year when traveling in Denmark.I highly recomend it to anyone who has a girl seriously into anything princess and loves to play with lego.
3,good strong oolong,"This is a strongly flavored, astringent oolong tea. It is reasonably priced (that is priced as a beverage) and the same tea being sold at several times the cost by various vendors pushing it for its weight loss properties. It produces a cloudy, medium brown brew with strong, slightly rough flavor. Oolongs from this particular location are reputed to aid in losing weight. I prefer smoother oolongs with a lighter, clearer brew, but this is a matter of taste. This is a good, solid but not inspiring tea."
2,"Decent tea, but overpriced","This tea is an alright oolong, but it is nothing special. It is definitely not worth the price listed here. Maybe it is worth half that amount. There are much better oolongs out there for a cheaper price. This tea basically lacks character, being neither dark and rich, nor sweet and refreshing. As I have said before, better oolongs are available, even in teabag form, that are far better than this. I barely even touch this tin anymore, because I prefer other oolongs.Foojoy China Classic Min-nan Oolong Tea - 100 Tea BagsFooJoy Tie Guan Yin Tea - 100 Individually Wrapped Tea Bags (7.0 Oz)High Grade Famous Fujian Anxi Golden Oolong (Wu Long) Loose Leaf Tea - Huangjingui Oolong - 3.5 Oz"
2,Was hoping for more,"Ooling is my favorite tea but this one was a disappointment. It was fairly weak in flavor even when adding extra leaves, also the flavor seemed 'off' to me."
5,I'm not a tea expert,"But I know what I like, and I am enjoying this recent purchase of All Natural Chinese Wuyi Oolong Tea."
2,expensive shipping,Thought I'd try this tea. Wrong choice. Tea is not as good as Numi's Iron Goddess of Mercy Oolong tea. Perhaps my favorite Oolong. Shipping costs almost as much as the tea on the Natural Chinese Wuyi Oolong. I'll stay with Numi Tea from now on.
3,"Oolong, is Ooweak...",Not sure how it's suppose to be cause this is the first time purchasing it...however this particular tea is kinda weak...I'll try it one more time to decide the fate of the tea's future...
3,Ta Hung Pao - Decent Oolong - But very mild,"So I ordered this from summit tea by way of amazon. Arrived quickly. Nice hand written thank you from summit on order from.:) - But the tea itself brews a mild golden cup (2-7min). Not dark and aromatic like other dark oolongs. Not like tea quan yin at all. Don't get me wrong, the tea itself is pleasant enough. I just was expecting a darker more aromatic tea. My bad. I should have done more research. The company Summit Tea is great tho.Pauly"
3,Some Things Considered,"Bob Edwards is/was a fine radio host. His Morning Edition conversations with Red Barber define for me the best of public radio. As a biographer? Edwards is adequate -- a little thin in places, workmanlike in his prose, but nowhere near the quality and depth one would expect from someone who showed the ability to achieve high levels of preparation on a daily basis for more than two decades."
3,Everything You Wanted to Know About Edward R. Murrow,"Bob Edwards has written two books. His first, ""Mornings with Red,"" is way superior to the second. Now, ""Mornings with Red"" is terrific, so let's not condemn ""Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism."" But let's just say it did what it set out to do -- and nothing more. Edwards admits as much in the first couple of pages, when he recommends previous books devoted to Murrow and his boys."
1,it was shipped minis the jacket you see in the photo.,he got the book cheap as it had no jacket which identifies the book and author with the photo of Murrow
5,Galaxy Quest,My Family loved Galaxy Quest ... It was so funny on so many levels... Great writers and a Outstanding cast....
3,A Bit Fragile,"The glass beaker frequently sticks and is difficult to seperate from the metal frame that surrounds it (which you have to do to clean it). You really have to wiggle it around, and I'm afraid that the beaker will break any day now since the glass is pretty thin. However, it hasn't broken yet, and I do have to commend the product for not leaking any coffee grounds into my coffee."
1,Dead Upon Arrival,"This coffeemaker looked great on the web site. Loved the color. However when it arrived it was so poorly packed the glass inside the red shell was totally shattered. As soon as I picked up the package I could hear the rattling of broken glass. Amazon accepted it back with no problem, but it was very frustrating to go through the process of researching, then selecting ""just the right coffeemaker,"" then waiting for its arrival, only to find it was so poorly wrapped. We went to Targer and bought a Bodum French press locally. It's great."
2,Oh please part 2,"Let's see....where can I begin?This book allows the strange continuance of events in the first book of the series.In this book Hawaii is successfully invaded by Japan. I ask how? With the aircraft carrier Hillary Clinton in permanent dock in the continental US it's entire compliment of aircraft would reasonably have been based in Hawaii....including it's AWAC's. How could an invasion fleet (even a rogue 2020 ship) get close enough for a strike/invasion?I applaud Birmingham's idea behind the book series when it comes to social effects, but the difference in military abilities over the 80 years in the span are simply so great that there is no way a 1940's naval force could succeed. It renders the basic premise untenable."
3,Slow getting started but a decent ending,The book took a long time to get going and there were lot of side stories that were left hanging.
3,Not as good as #1 BUT . . . .,I'm only giving this three stars. The first book was a 5 star.The reason is that it takes a while to really get into Book 2 and a lot of it seems . . fluffy and non related. About halfway throught the book the military aspect starts to pull things together and FINALLY the book takes off.With that said - I can't wait untill I get book 3.
4,Military SF that's heavy on the SF,"I'm generally don't read Military SF, not for reasons of political or personal taste, but because I find most Military SF heavy on the Military and light on the SF. I picked up Birmingham's first book, Weapon of Choice, on a whim, and I'm glad I did. Like the other military SF authors on my short list (Eric Flint, for example) Birmingham gets deeper into the thought-provoking ideas that come out of a speculative situation.There's some combat and some fun with high-tech weaponry, but there's also real SF, looking at the culture clash between 2020 and 1940, the effects that prolonged ideological wars might have on our current culture, and the impact of a glimpse of the future on course of the war. He also looks at more military topics like the impact that modern military theories of operations and training might have on WW II, as the high-tech ammo starts to run out."
1,Enable Speech!,I enjoyed the first book in the series. I recently became a truck driver and now listen to my kindle books. I wont buy these sequels unless text to speech is enabled!
5,eye opener,I may only be In junior high but I know a good book when I see one and I know that I would love to be with biddy on Alcatraz.
2,someone is hiding on alcatraz island,I really did not like my book it was too long and it just wasnt my type of genre and the title make it sound more interesting than it really is.The best part of the book is the beginning when the boy goes to alcatraz island.The setting was pretty good to me b/c its kind of similair to todays society. The characters werew pretty cool to b/c the also were similair to today society.
1,Alcatraz Escape,"Someone is hiding on Alcatraz Island is an action story, but at some points it turns into a love story. It was written by Eve Bunting and published in New York in 1983.A boy named Danny was walking down the street when all of a sudden he sees an old woman, resembling his own grandmother, being mugged by a kid. He instantly sprints over to the old woman and pushes the boy down to the ground and helps the old woman. Little did Danny know that the boy was the brother of someone who is in the undisputed toughest gang around, The Outlaws.Danny is a 14 year old boy, he is a very fast runner. He lives in San Francisco, California. Biddy is an Alcatraz Island ranger she helps Danny out along the way and she sits with Danny on the boat when they are on the way to Alcatraz Island. The members of the outlaws are Cowboy, Jelly bean (the brother of the kid who was mugging the old lady on the street), Priest, and Maxie. The outlaws are the toughest gang in San Francisco."
3,"""Good, When you start reading this book you can't stop!""","The book begins in California during the summertime. The main character Danny is trying to stay away from the ""outlaws"", a group of four teenagers Cowboy, Priest, Jellybean, and Maxie. The outlaws always get into trouble. Danny is trying to stay away from them because he helped an old lady get her purse back from on of the outlaws relatives. And then one day he ran into them and before he knew it all of them and a girl named biddy was on Alcatraz Island.I got his book because it was the best book I could find. I thought this book would be about someone that got lost on Alcatraz Island. Just by looking at the cover I thought that I chose the right book. When I was done the book, it wasn't what I thought it would be like. When I was done the book I still thought that I had found the right book."
