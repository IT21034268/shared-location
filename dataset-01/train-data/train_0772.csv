3,Some love them...I wasn't one of them,"Many people swear by these diapers for their newborns. I personally did not care for how bulky they were and didn't like the snaps, especially when she was tiny. I like Thirsties and BumGenius Bamboo Fitteds better."
3,hoping they will work good,maybe i am writing this review prematurely but i got them yesterday and a snap already popped off. and they are not the same diaper as shown in the picture. but they still look like good diapers that will hold everything in. *fingers crossed- i cant change the rating- but i would come back and give four stars- they turned out to be one of my favorite diapers for her. they absorb so well. they do take a little bit longer to dry though and she grew out of them before she did under the nile organic diapers but they still worked great.
4,"Very cute, but could get better if would be more asorbent!","These diapers are very very cute. The fit is terrific, even ny tiny newborn fitted just fine. They hold just any type of poopoos. I have only one complain - absorbency. My daughter was a gentle wetter so they worked all right most of the time, except times when enjoyed her drink more than normally, so forget about using them overnight."
3,"They aren't a ""must-have"" diaper","These diapers got really soaked when baby peed (just one pee!) and newborns are more sensitive to wet than older babies. They are bulky, by the time you get the diaper and cover on the baby you might not love cloth diapers anymore. My 8lb baby completely outgrew them in 2 1/2 weeks so they aren't economical. They take a long time to dry compared to a prefold or microfiber pocket insert. In my experience any fitted diaper will contain newborn poop better than a prefold and prefolds will do the job if you prefer. In other words, get a cheap fitted, use prefolds or disposables for the newborn stage. I got Softbums at 3 months and wish I had had them from the start, then I wouldn't have needed newborn diapers..."
1,"Biography - Denver, John (1943-1997): An article from: Contemporary Authors","The information gathered for this project is available for free with very little Googling. While most of the information in this report seems correct, your money would be better spent on a John Denver CD!"
5,Great Sound,"I love the upbeat, euro, electro-vibe, sound to this albumn. It makes you want to dance and at the same time are great songs to vibe to in your car. This is a good album for all dance and electronica fans. Their music video rocks too!!"
4,Hip Hop has never sounded like this!,"Sure, I have heard hip hop LIKE this, but not exactally the same.I have followed the Anticon label for years and having been a resident of Oakland for numerous years I expierenced the Anticon boys do there take on hip hop.cLOUDDEAD though sheads all formulas of traditional hip hop and embraces a little bit of everything.Droney tones under hip hop beats and rappers harmonizing does not classify to me as normal Hip Hop, But this record isn't all just experimental to be experimental. I feel that they make valid statements about the current state of the world, but most importantly the current state of the U.S (we all know the garbage that goes on).So go buy it......give it a spin......and take notes.....this is a learning expierence."
5,"I love this album, and I'm not sure why....","This isn't a ""must-own for any hip-hop fan."" This isn't a ""chart-topping hit."" I'm not even sure I would label it as hip-hop, it's got a cool folk feel on a couple songs. I picked this album up on a hunch at a library, thinking I recognized the name ""cLOUDDEAD"" from somewhere. I didn't, although I had heard Dose One before on the Aesop Rock track ""Odessa."" This was nothing like Dose on that song, but I liked this album anyway. Maybe you will too."
2,Blurry eccentricities,"2 1/2This menacing geek-rap does have its quirky benefits but usually chokes on any goodwill flow springing forth because constant, self-conscious anti-mainstream posturing just seems to cloud artistic direction."
3,Disappointing,"This is the same cLOUDDEAD that produced their original album. You can hear the similarities in the creative content and the same versatility in their voices.Ten, however, is not as beautiful, intricate or moving as its predecessor. If you loved cLOUDDEAD's first album, you still may be better off passing on Ten as knowing that they deviated so far from the quality of the first album is like the day I realised that Trent Reznor just wasn't angry anymore."
2,What Happened???,"Here's the deal: if you loved ""Clouddead"", as I do, you will be disappointed by ""Ten."" I was looking forward to this album for months and it was a huge letdown. It's overhyped because it's an Anticon release and people are supposed to give it good reviews. Odd Nosdam's beats are pretty bare, Dose and Why just don't seem too much into it, and neither was I, unfortunately..."
5,One of my old time favorites,"I first got this album when I was an impressionable seventeen year old. At that age I found the entire story of a summer vacation in a far away country very much parallel to my own summer vacation in Europe that year. Besides that I found that Mick Taylor has played some of his best solos on this record. The solo on ""Long gone midnight"" is still one of my favorites."
3,A Transitional Album,"After the big band approach of ""Bare Wires"" fell apart,Mayall went in the opposite direction --- no more ""Bluesbreakers"", just a ""small backup band."" Mick Taylor is the lone holdover from previous albums, setting a record for a Mayall guitarist (his predecessors Eric Clapton and Peter Green lasted one album each).A loose concept album based on Mayall's vacation in California, some of the material is corny and self-indulgent, but Taylor does some of his best guitar work, and ""Fly Tomorrow"" features one of his best solos. ""The Bear"", ""Walking on Sunset"", and ""Long Gone Midnight"" are also essential songs.Not as consistent as Mayall's previous work --- or ""The Turning Point"" which was his next album --- this is still a worthwhile record for anyone who appreciates Mayall's ""British Blues"" sensibilities and Mick Taylor's guitar work."
4,Some memorable tracks,"As a Mayall junkie, this is one of my original albums I continue to play. This album contains some of the best guitar by Mick Taylor that I have heard from him. Check out 'First Time Alone' and 'Fly Tomorrow' particularly. It also contains the memorable mood track 'First Time Alone' featuring Peter Green. 4 stars may be a little high, but Mayall has always failed to get the nod from the critics and he deserves much more."
5,"hey, baja del arbol y senti el boogie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","De los grandes trabajos que nos tiene acostumbrado el viejo john, este quizas sea uno de los mas accesibles y sencillo, sin dejar de ser por ello un gran disco! temas como ""walking on sunset"" o bien ""the bear (homenaje al recordado cantante de canned heat)"" son muestras suficientes del espiritu vago y relajado que se respira en el album. altamente recomendable, con guitarras de un adolescente mick taylor que brillaria luego en los stones y aqui ya esta pidiendo pista......."
1,do not do it,"This is a terrible game and can't even measure up to it's predecessor Dune 2, the original real time strategy game. Unfortunately, it is rehash of the original with no interface improvements, which will become old quickly to those playing any newer RTS. Wait for Emperor of Dune or pick up the original."
2,"Ludicrously not Dune, nor a good RTS","First off, I'd like to say this is NOT Dune. Second off, there are so many better RTS's worth more than this game.The story has already been done, in Dune 2. Also, since this game calls itself DUNE 2000, it should at least have the aspects of the story Dune. It does not. This game seems more like another piece of Command & Conquer.The graphics are terrible 2D. The overall speed of the game is also disappointingly slow, making me wish I could just hurry up my men a few seconds faster. While playing the game, I got the feeling that it was nothing more than a slightly prettier version of Dune 2.If you are really that desperate for an RTS, get StarCraft. But if you want a GOOD RTS, than get something like Age of Empires II, or Red Alert 2, or something along those lines. You should not waste YOUR hard earned money on something like this."
4,Great Game!,"I got Dune 2000 two summer's ago for my birthday and I totally spaced on it until I found it on a shelf. I opened it, installed it and I was blown away at it. It was similar to Command and Conqour which I liked, I liked how you could play the Atreides, Harkonnen or Ordos, and the great movies in between the missions. I prefer the Atreides over all the houses; sort of mirror's who I am. One problem I had was that some of the missions where very hard and took a long time to beat. The vehicles where sort of slow; and expensive but those two where the only problems I had with the game. But it was fun."
1,DO NOT BUY FOR MULTIPLAYER,"I just got this game in the mail. Had purchased two copies, one for me and One for a very good friend, so we could play online, just as the game says you can play. well, buyer beware. a WASTE of money. There is no way to play this game online. There is no way to connect using IP addresses. the only weay is to call your friends modem, a very outdated thing, in a world wher emost people use dial up ISPs. they Do have a way to connect using a battle.net type server, but after tlking to tech suppor tont he phone, i have found out they no longe rsupport this serve reither. the person on the phone told us, we were 'out of luck' if we wanted to play online and NOt on a network int he same room. if you want it for single player, then go for it. but if you wish to play head to head with anyone, go play Star wars: Galatic Battlegrounds"
3,Fun war game.,"In Dune 2000 you choose 1 out of three houses to play as. In the game you must accomplish objectives while battling with the other two houses. Dune is the planet you are fighting on. The house that defeats the other two houses takes over Dune. In the game you get to build your own personal war base and start building up your army to fight in large battles to the death. The graphics of the game aren't all that great. It isn't very detailed, but you know why when you play it because Dune is nothing but sand and deserts. The sound in the game is okay. Mostly just simple noises. The control is excellent. It is very easy and responsive. The gameplay of this game is pretty fun, but I gave it 3 stars because of the sound and graphics. I recommend this game."
4,"Pricey, but larger than you'd think",The bag works well (especially for traveling with dirty cloth diapers) and is much bigger than we expected. I still think the $20 was a bit high though.
4,A Fun Tape To Own!,"These episodes of ""The Honeymooners"" are a couple of good ones. The first one, ""The People's Choice,"" shows Ralph running for city council after he got involved with a couple of shady characters. The ending, where he gives up his political career for Alice, is what makes this series so wonderful and touching. The other skit is a short one, ""What's the Name?,"" and is highlighted by the performance of Jackie and Audrey Meadows performing the song ""One Of These Days, POW!"" This is almost a foreshadow for the musical Trip To Europe shows to be performed during the 1956-1957 season. (These will later be remade in 1966.) Overall, there are better episodes but these are two shows that will give the viewer some entertaining moments and some good laughs."
4,Bach the rhythm king,"These pieces for solo violin are often described as cerebral and difficult. That may be so for some, but in Luca's hands they become anything but academic exercises. First, he plays sarabandes and allemandes as dances, which they in fact are, and in the process reveals their immense internal drive and passion. Second, his phrasing has a wonderful sense of line, as if he's thinking the music out loud, nearly improvising. And third, his bowing is rosinous and places a kind of insistence on dissonant, strong beats, which increases the sense that these pieces are as nearly wide-ranging as emotional adventures as they are as intellectual ones. After a few hearings, you might blast the up-tempo pieces in your car with the top down. Highly recommended."
5,Masterful,"Sergiu Luca plays Bach with amazing beauty and grace. In this particular rendition of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas, Sergiu Luca plays upon a Baroque violin. Not only is it beautiful, but it maintains the original quality and dynamics of the Baroque era. I highly recommend this CD. Bach should only be played by a master, and Sergiu Luca definitely fills the role."
3,My Interpretation as a Guitarist,"I had asked my violinist friend to recommend a recording of the Sonatas and Partitas, and she mentioned this one. On listening, I found that the performer used short articulations, ""notes inegales (where the dotted notes ""swing""),"" and was often out of tune. I don't know if some of those techniques have something to do with historic instruments and style, but I just don't get it. My most critical comment was that he was really out of tune on some crucial doublestops that my ear just could not comprehend.I'm just a guitarist, so please (if you're a violinist) consult your teachers and colleagues about what recording to learn from and enjoy. I highly recommend Hilary Hahn's recording over this one - she makes every note sing and plays so perfectly. Again, this is just my opinion."
2,Almost but not quite turkey,It SMELLS like turkey but taste like salt. I would like to see low sodium versions of all the flavors - not just chicken.
4,No MSG Claim BS,"One star off for lying: get a clue folks: autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed vegetable compound, are just other names for MSG.That said, this stuff is very useful. A handmade stock is not always needed. This stuff reconstitutes quickly."
5,Dark and glorious,"I liked Heather Duby's first album upon first listen. Lovely soprano voice, interesting use of electronica. But it didn't stick, and I can't remember the last time I listened to it. _Come Across the River_, her second solo album, is a giant leap forward. It's less aggressive, more textured, more interesting. Her voice has changed, become deeper, huskier.The album has a quiet intensity and something a touch Southern about it, in the way that the Cowboy Junkies have. Much of it feels like a dark street on a dark night. I hear it coming from around the corner (or, really, out of my stereo), and it holds me there without letting go. It has wonderful string arrangements, heaviness and lightness in the right places. I don't know how to describe it well; I just know it calls me to listen. The song titles are also wonderfully strange, and they add to the mystery of the album, especially since lyrics aren't included."
4,Unreal & Very Pleasing Price!,These boots and beautiful and very stylish! The price was just astounding; I couldn't be any happier about that.One of the boots rubbed on the ankle for the first few days and felt tighter than is comfortable. But after a few days of breaking the boots in they became easy and comfortable to wear.
3,"cute, but wide leg","it would've been very helpful had the product description stated that these boots have a 14"" circumference on the widest part of the shaft; my calves are 13"" max, and as soon as I tried these boots on it was ridiculously obvious they don't fit me in the leg (altho' the shoe part of the boot is true to size)... I'm a little irked about having to spend extra $ to send them back; next time I won't buy boots -- esp stretch boots -- that don't specify the shaft circumference... :\ other than that, these ARE cute boots, and if they'll fit your legs, I'm sure they'll look great w/skirts, wool shorts, etc."
5,Dual Language Instruction,I ordered the book and it came in the manner it was described and in a timely fashion. It has provided the feed back I needed for the classroom and an excellent buy in my book.
2,the foundations of dual language instruction,"I was not pleased with the book I ordered. The summary stated ""like new"" condition but upon receipt it had yellow and pink highlighting all throughout the book. Also it was written along the sides of different passages. I did not have time to send it back for refund since my semester had already started. Unfortunately, I will not be ordering from this company again.Jinny"
2,Misleading Photo,"I looked carefully at three similarly-priced items from different manufacturers before choosing the Stanton 500 V3. All items had received comparable reviews. I was disappointed when the cartridge I received looked considerably different than the one in the photo. In the photo, the word ""Stanton"" is painted directly on the cartridge. On my cartridge, the word ""Stanton"" is a rectangular sticker, and it is slightly crooked, making the item appear--to my eyes at least--cheaply constructed.Perhaps I am too picky and put too much emphasis on appearance; but if appearance is not important, why didn't Stanton show me an accurate picture of the item I was buying? Because if they had, I would have bought a Shure or an Audio-Technica cartridge instead, that's why.Thus far the item's performance seems fine; I've only had it for one day. But still I'm disappointed, because I'm fifty bucks poorer and my Stanton 500 V3 looks like a cheap piece of junk. I wish it looked like the one in the photo."
3,Kitchen brush,The bristles are way too stiff but I like the way it fits in your hand. I had bought a Libman kitchen brush about 5 years ago but the bristles were alot softer and cleaned everything so much better.
3,A little short,"The description says it is 9"" but because of the bend it is a lot shorter. I measured the handle and it is only 5"" to the bend. Wish I would have ordered the longer one, but at this point not worth it to return it and get a different one."
2,For fans only,"After their five year haitus, this long-awaited album was disappointing. Justin's contributions are the only worthwhile pieces at all. ""Had to fall in love"" and ""Driftwood"" are solid Hayward songs--lyrical, sweet-natured and pleasing--but not spectacular. By far the most interesting song on this record is Justin's ""The Day We Meet Again,"" a radical departure from his typical style. It sounds like the 3 a.m. drunken ramblings of someone who's just had their heart shattered, as it careens wildly from hope to deep despondency. It's worth buying the album for this song alone, especially if you've just had your heart stomped on and you can't find your Patsy Cline collection."
2,Really a 1.5,"A truly horrible comeback. Bland pop tunes that sound nothing at all like The Moody Blues we knew from 1967-1972. I agree ""The Day We Meet Again"" is the best, and ""I'll Be Level With You"" is alright, but ""Under Moonshine"", ""I'm Your Man"", ""Steppin' In A Slide Zone"", and ""Had To Fall In Love"" are Moody Blues at their all time worst."
2,Octave is a middle C at best,"The few years spent apart from the rest of the band apparently wasn't long enough for Hayward and Lodge. Their work here sounds like leftover tracks from their solo records. The Day We Meet Again comes closest to recapturing some of that old Hayward Moodies magic, but then Nostradamus from his Songwriter release did it much better. Lodge opens the album with the very boring Steppin' in a Slide Zone. His other contribution, Survival, is better but the extremely poor production values make it sound like it was recorded in a pool of sludge. Pinder turns in a decent enough tune, but after a few plays it too becomes tired and forgettable. Only Edge and Thomas manage to sound like they're still writing for the Moody Blues. For the serious Moodies collector only."
2,The Return of the Moodies,"Even though it had been six years since their last album, the boys had been very busy. All members released at least one solo album, and Hayward and Lodge recorded together. So it's not like they had a huge backlog of songs that had piled up, and it shows here. The song selection is weak, and the band seems to be going through the motions here. The first side of the album is pretty solid, but the second side is abyssmal. Skip this one and go right to the much better Long Distance Voyager."
3,badly produced,"This has always been an album I loved, but it hasn't aged particularly well, and I find weaknesses and murky production everywhere. 'Driftwood' is a beautiful song, but it is over-produced, with saxophone doodling (no need for it), and too many instruments at one time. Why not leave it simple? 'Survival' similarly i a gorgeous song, but there are so many things going on at once and it goes very out of tune at the end. A shame. The highlight for me is Mike Pinder' 'one step into the light', gorgeous mellotron passage and a nice melody. Jutin Hayward also has the very beautiful 'had to fall in love', which is an acoustic folk song, wiht Ray on harmonica.It is a nice album and very mellow in places, but I feel with the next two albums, the Moody blues definitely reasserted themselves."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a good CD - the songs aren't the usual Moody Blues...usually, they have an upbeat tune, but the songs on Octave are just ""there"", comparing it to their other CD's. But, it is still ok."
3,MIDDLIN' MOODYS,"OCTAVE was a reunion album after the Blues finished their seventh sojourn and took time off for personal projects. OCTAVE is also one of my least favorite Moody offerings. Other than the elegant ballad DRIFTWOOD, there isn't any real OMG tunes. The album's only hit STEPPIN IN A SLIDE ZONE is an average up-tempo track that doesn't break any new ground for the MB's. A required inclusion for Moody fans but not recommended for neophyte listeners. Go to SEVENTH SOJOURN for a better representation of the band's musical genius."
2,Disappointing,"I've been a Moody Blues fan since I was a kid, but I thought this album was disappointing. The sound quality is murky and the songs just don't grab me. ""Slide Zone"" was just plan embarrassing. If you want to hear the Moody Blues, listen to any other album before or after this one."
2,Where's the Mellotron???,"Almost everything's been said and sides taken amongst M.B diehard fans which i am.I go with the truly disappointed ones,a few'good' songs but surely nothing to hold on to after the thrill of getting a new Moody Blues album in almost 6 years had worn off.I would also like to point out the Mellotron's disapearing act on this album.I can't hear the darn contraption(i love Mellotron played on all those prog. albums of the 60's and 70's from Beatles to Crowded House even in the 80's)and the overall production is not up to M.B standards.Definitely the real comeback album is Long Distance Voyager even without Mike Pinder.After that the Moodies start to fade away ""progressively""."
2,"Sounds Great, Lousy Album","Someone wrote that everything will be released on CD sooner or later. This just in...everything will be re-released and remastered sooner or later by greedy record companies trying to stay alive. Such is the case here. Take Octave for what it truly is, an uneven mish-mash of styles from a band trying to regain their focus after a long sabbatical. Yes, there are some nice moments but there are a lot of dreadful ones as well. Fast forward to the BONUS tracks. Five live cuts culled from various shows that sound like they were recorded over the phone from the 99th row. Save your money if you think there is anything revelatory on these tracks. The title for this album should have been ""Will The Real Moody Blues Please Stand Up"". An embarassment!"
2,I only like one song off this one,"I was never a big Moody Blues fan but this does have one great song...""Steppin in a Slide Zone"". I like it because it rocks much harder than their typical works. ""Driftwood"" and ""I'll be Level with you"" are also good. After that, the quality severely wanes."
2,they all step and slid....,"Yup the members all slid into the abyss of pointless and directionless musicianship in this album. It seems evident that Mike Pinder just fulfilled his contractual obligation just to satisfy those who demands it. Iam a great fan of the Moody Blues and surely a big rebound came in Long Distance Voyager but certainly this album is the poorest of them all. The only track worthy of keeping this album is the opening track ""Steppin on a slide zone"" but the following tracks are total rubbish devoid of praise. So many times I try to appreciate this cd but most often I just realized that I have fallen into a deep nap. But if you have steppin.. track in any compilation of the MB, better skip this cd. Actually I bought this cd for [price] but decided to dispose it in the sale bin for only [price] and I dont feel sorry. Yup they all step and slid into the club of recycled cds."
5,verry impressesive,"the ring is beutiful more than i was expected in the picture, arrival fast. the price is good too. so i would recommend anyone with Gem Avenue"
4,Pretty Ring,"I really like this little ring. Unfortunately, they didn't have it in the size I needed and I bought a bigger size that doesn't quite fit. I like the blue stone and styling...would recommend to everyone!"
4,Friendly Village,"My husband and I bought this book, because he remembered reading it in elementary school. It was his childhood utopia. He recounted one of the stories in that book, and I wanted to read more.It was strange and interesting to revisit those decades. The book's value for us is historical. It met our needs and expectations as an historical snapshot of the culture and values of that time."
5,NEIGHBOR LAW,"GREAT PRICE GREAT BOOK, IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE BUSINESS BOOKS TO LEARN HOW TO STAY AHEAD AND TO TEACH YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN."
4,An elegant story,"Wonderfully quirky novella. Simply told and elegantly written, this is definitely a writer to watch. Rice has captured the essence of sibling love from a child's perspective and made it into a captivating fable."
4,Its a scale.,"It works as advirtised. It tells you how fat you are. Depending on your goals you can look at the wieght and go back to playing video games or watching TV or head over to the gym. As for its functionality, it is easy to read and i find it is fairly accurate. It's a good buy and a decent price."
2,Disappointed...too much motor noise in the audio,"This camera has a lot going for it...especially for the price. The video quality is good, it interfaces well to a PC over firewire, small size, decent controls, etc., etc.But, I am returning it.The motor noise on the audio is a killer drawback.I have been taking videos of my 4 month old son but during playback it sounds like there is a locust invasion preparing to bounce during any break in his cooing.I was wondering if I was being too picky so I compared the audio with that of the Canon miniDV I bought in 1998 (yes, 1998) and the Canon was sooooooo much quieter.Too bad....'cos this cam was otherwise very nice."
3,"jvc, its ok.","after reading other reviews, i decided to buy the higher model. jvc gr-d295u. i didn't have any problem, with the noises that other claims. it has the same functions as the grd270 but it has a sd memory card slot. i haven't use it a lot but it works fine.cons- the zoom in button is so close to the snapshot button.you accidentally press the wrong one.also, thinking the higher model will give a great phototo print out from the sd memory card, not so.yet, it small light weight, video quality is good on my sony tv.i give it 3 1/2 star."
2,great camera while it works.,"this camera is an excellent camera. i bought it and it took great videos and good still pics. about a year after i got the camera i started getting an error message on the screen. it said that the unit was in safeguard mode eject and reinsert tape. upon doing so, nothing happened. the message still showed up on the screen. i tried everything i could think of to reset the camera. i removed the battery for several hours and tried again and the message still appeared. i have recently sent a message to jvc and am waiting for a reply on how to solve this problem. if you buy this camera make sure you get an extened warranty on it."
4,JVC camcorder,"Good product, had it for a year now. Wish I had bought the one with a jack for an external microphone. Consider that if you are buying a camcorder that will be used for recording teachings or other educational event. It has good sound pick up but not good enough for proper recording of teachings."
1,JVC products will have problems after an year,I had JVC product and some of my friends too. These are good at the begining and after an year the motors will have problem and also the tape heads will have problem. Even the cable pins will wearout easaly and will not work properly. Price may be less buy its not worth for long run. I feel Sony and Canon are better than JVC. Even Hitachi is good.
2,Java 2 Database Programming For Dummies,"This book has devoted two-third of the coverage to explain what is a database, types, conditional operator and so on. Readers would be benefit if they are not familiar with writing or understanding basic SQL statements. For those readers who are from SQL programming background, this book offers very little insight knowledge of how the java interact with the database such as passing binding variables. Most regretably, the majority of examples that author tries to demonstrate how the java interact with the database are unrealistic such as creating, dropping table using static SQL statment wrapped in java code."
1,Someone is kidding someone. Guess who is kidding whom?,Book is not close to anything worthwhile paying for. This title should be changed to 'Some stuff about databases'. Has a M$ bias as shown by using access as database. Using jdbc to odbc as connection type with little to no examples. If the whole book was a here is how to use java to connect to and use data from a database he 'Jim Keogh' might have produced something worth the title and price. Mr. Keogh is Chair E-Commerce Track of Columbia University? That is scary. This book should be a not thanks I will pass.
2,"Poor dummies book, same thing over and over.","This book has one redeeming fact, it shows you the methods and programming blocks to set up a Java application ready to execute SQL commands, and then it repeats the same thing over and over every chapter for the rest of the book!If you have knowlede of SQL (which is obvious if you purchased this book) then you only need to read the first few chapters.I suggest barganing at the local book store for the first few chapters, offer them $5 and you cut the first few chapters out."
1,If you seek the real truth....,"I have no doubt that the author is well-intended. Unfortunately, like all books that claim there will be ""an end of this world"" and a ""second coming of Christ,"" this is based on misinterpretation and misunderstanding of Scriptures. If you seek the real truth, keep looking. The sooner we all recognize the truth, the sooner God's New Kingdom will be established on the earth, which shall last forever, never to be destroyed. That's what real prophecy foretells."
5,Major Bible Themes,This item arrived in excellent shape. It is nice to have an individual copy during our study. Being able to read a chapter ahead of time makes it easy to keep up with discussions.
5,An excellent resource to study the Bible,"We've used this book since 1982 for individual studies and Bible study groups. It's an excellent resource for studying the Bible. It's just as valuable for new Christians as it is helpful for mature believers. The book contains 52 vital doctrines of the Bible, the cardinal doctrines that are essential for the understanding of Christianity and for a Christian's growth. It features chapters on ""The Bible,"" ""God the Son,"" ""God the Trinity,"" ""God the Holy Spirit,"" ""Satan,"" ""Man,"" ""The Church,"" ""The Second Coming of Christ,"" and so much more. Each chapter concludes with a short test which will be very helpful in Bible study groups. Everything is explained in an easy-to-understand format. This book is very helpful and we highly recommend it."
1,DIdn't work.,"The splitter didn't work. I tried multiple setups and could not get a single one to function, even to splice to signals together. My optical audio cables work (I checked) and then the company sent me another splitter, and it STILL doesn't work.I don't know if it's meant to splice a toslink signal into two so you can connect it to two sources or what, but when I tried to let it function to split my Soundbar's inputs to two, it did not work.Either this is a crappy product that doesn't work, or I used it wrong."
1,It doesn't work.,"The ""splitter"" degrades the LASER signal so much that our receiver optical sensor doesn't pick it up. You can see the difference in the strength of the LASER light from the cable and from the ""splitter"" output. Don't buy this item."
1,This Does Not Work!!!!,"This does not work for what most people's intentions are. Regardless of what you've read, it does not work as a splitter for two devices in, one device out. I've tried every possible configuration and can only get it to work as nothing more then an extender for a single cable. It doesn't matter if one of your two devices is off, as long as there are two cables present, it will not send the signal. Fortunately it was pretty cheap, but still, cost plus shipping didn't make up for the frustration spent trying to get this to work ""As Advertised"""
4,Enjoyable but Predictable,"THe only reason I gave the book four stars is the fact that it (and many other L'Amour books) is so predictable. Good triumphs over evil. But other than that, it was a great action-packed little story, perfect for a exciting weekend read. BUY IT!"
4,Take It For What It Is...,"This is not classic Bon Jovi, they didn't intend it to be. I give them all the credit in the world for being innovative and having the guts to put it out there. I love Bon Jovi and I love all the past songs, but this just shows again why they have lasted so long. As I have matured so has their music. This is one of the best. Interestingly enough, the songs I never cared for and thought were alittle cheesy have now become my favorites. ""Bad Medicine"", if you don't like this then you must be a monk, VERY sexy. ""Lay Your Hands On Me"", soooo much better. Now the reason I gave it 4 stars, my all time favorite, ""I'll Be There For You"" lost all of its emotion. Sorry guys but this was the one dissapointment.If you want the old style, then listen to the old stuff. But if you want to hear some great music that stands on its own, buy this one. I haven't listened to anything else since I bought it. The music is great and Jon's vocals are incredible.THANKS GUYS FOR SOME GREAT NEW MUSIC!"
1,WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!!,"I,ve been a Bon Jovi fan forever but this left feels wrong,You can,t take songs that people have loved for years and destroy them.You should be ashamed!!Put out an album with all the original version of all those songs on it and i,d buy it and play it everyday."
1,messed up,if u like bon jovi this cd is not for you unless you also like like calm low tempo music. they destroyed some of the greatest hits i want to burn (litterally) evrey copy. this is terrible
2,Why?!,"I usually download a cd, listen to it then buy it if I like it. I do not do this with Bon Jovi however, because they are my favorite band. But I really wish I would have downloaded the CD first. Then at least I would not be out $21.95. This is a sad day in the world of music."
2,What Were They Thinking?,I've been a fan of Bon Jovi since i could walk and it truly amazes me how dissapointed I was in this cd. I honestly had to ask myself what were they thinking. This cd puts a twist on our favorite classics alright...almost like they've been taken to hell. Were they drunk or something? Hopefully none of us will ever have to hear anything from Bon Jovi as bad as this again.
1,DEAD and ALIVE!,"The CD is DEAD, but they are still ALIVE..........so get back into the studio guys and Rock ON! never mind this getting old now gotta play mellow junk!!!!! I'm greatly disappointed in this CD. Perhaps, one - three songs are ok, but the WHOLE CD is a ONE STAR! I've been a fan for 20years guys, take this one wiht a grain of salt! This CD SUCKS!!!"
1,Sambora Disappeared,"I wasn't at all happy with this disc. As another review stated, it was supposed to be a live acoustic set, and the best part of those is Sambora's back-up and harmonies. This album was a true disappointment!! There is no great guitar work (acoustic or electric) of Sambora's, and his voice is nowhere to be found. BOO!!!! If you're a Jon fan however, this should be heaven to you."
1,Wasn't One Song I Enjoyed,"I'm sorry Bon Jovi, I have always been a huge fan, and I love your recent box set...but ""This left fee's right"" does NOT feel right to me! I cringed with every song.Let me repeat: I didn't like a single song. I tried to give the CD a chance, I listened to it once & I listened to it again. I found nothing redeeming. Thank god I only borrowed the CD from the library- or I'd be demanding my money back!!If you're looking for ""new"" BJ, get the new box set- it's awesome! It's worth the extra $$ by far."
1,This is terrible,"I bought this CD thinking it was some of Bon Jovi's top songs. It is their top songs, IN ELEVATOR STYLE. I listened to this CD once. Now I can't give it away. Once people hear it they refuse to take it. One person even brought it back to me."
1,Very disappointing!,"I am a die hard Bon Jovi fan. There are very few songs that I dislike by Jon and the boys. This album, however, is HORRIBLE. It's like Bon Jovi meets Radiohead, not a good combination. The band has done various acoustic versions of several of their hits, and this collection is very unnecessary. It sucks. Stick to writing new material boys!"
2,this left feels right,"If you like Bon Jovi because of all their hits you heard on the radio and bought this alblum to hear them at your leisure, then you will be disapointed. These are NOT the hit songs. This is Bon Jovi laying on couch, bored with their same old songs, obligated to the record company for another alblum.no passionno enthusiasmno fireblahIf you never heard of Bon Jovi and just stumbled across this alblum, you might like it. It's not bad in its own right, just way too far left of the songs that made them great."
5,this left feels right?????,i came from indonesiathis left feels right....this album almost like what i dreaming from bon jovi album.affter hear some from they live version .. i wonder why... never say goodbye like richie and jon played in NY...didnt included in this album.wanted didnt sound great ...and powerfull....mean while i found ..new master piece in the new livin on a prayer..uhm...new version ..uhm ..in the begining ..i'm confuse..wheres jon and olivia:D..they almost same:D..bad madicine...i always hate this song ..dunno...sound bad :D...better change with diamond ring:D...or...lie to me...its my life...uhm...cool..this song always cool...and about always..uhm...this song ..didnt sound great ...it should be full of tico!! but ...full of dave..may be in the next .. we can get the other album ..this right feels rightso long!!
5,This Left Feels Right: Greatest Hits With a Twist =......,"....another great record! I've been a fan of Bon Jovi since I was 4 (I'm now 18) and I'm not disappointed one bit in this album. A lot of people think that this album is not a real Bon Jovi album, but you have to take into consideration that they wanted to try something different and it was ballsy to put this record out.I definately reccommend this album to anyone who's a true Bon Jovi fan. If you're a true fan you'll love this album. Sure, there are some sore spots in this album (i.e. Bad Medicine) but besides that it's a great album! BUY IT!!"
3,Not Quite Right,"Why water down greatness? Like the liner notes say - it's ""ballsy"". Some of the songs are adaptable to this style; others just don't work. If you listen as if you've never heard these songs, you will understand that statement better. But it does grow on you some, so give it a bit of time."
3,Jon what did you do?,"I am one of the biggest Bon Jovi fan's around, been that way for years. Even had Bon Jovi birthday cakes made with Jon's face on it & had The Bounce album playing while I was in labor with my daughter but I am so disappointed with this album. I hate to say anything bad about Bon Jovi because I love them to death & am a Jersey girl myself but I really think they could have done something else. Even made another album instead of remaking all of them. Alot of the songs have a great beat & Jon sounds awesome but as they say don't fix it if it ain't broken. Sorry boys I still love ya though."
3,This is Right...almost,"Now I don't know why, but everytime I think of ""This Left..."" it always comes to mind what Linkin Park did on ""Reanimation""; which is basically take a set of songs, remix them and present them in a new way... while shocking fans on the way.I think Bon Jovi did a great job reworking most of these songs. It only feels that the new versions came out ""half-cooked""... maybe if they had worked them a little longer... who knows?"
1,"This Left Feels Wrong... VERY, VERY VERY, VERY WRONG!!!","Being a massive Bon Jovi fan for most of my life, I believe I am entitled to also be their greatest critic. And let me begin by saying, as if their cd's from the 90's weren't average enough, this cd SUX... this cd takes the cake for undoubtedly being the worst Bon Jovi cd EVER! Who are Bon Jovi trying to impress by raping their classic songs, especially the one's that made them who they are?! If only the band would grow their hair back and be the rock band they were before they sold out to stay on the pop charts (not that this album could possibly help the cause!).... what's next?! A duet with Britney Spears?!Don't waste your money on this cd, you'll listen to it once and then throw ""it in with the rest"".. 1 star is a compliment!"
1,Total Letdown!!!!!,"ok, I admit, I didn't read the reviews...I should have.This album is AWFUL!!!!!They took every kick-butt, hard-rock tune they ever did and turned them into a BALLAD!Yes, it's true. Imagine...""Bad Medicine"" sung as if it were a love song.If you're a Bon Jovi fan, and are looking for their ""Greatest Hits""...don't waste your money."
1,Just awful...,"Well, first the obligatory listener definition I suppose - I'm 30 years old and have been listening to Bon Jovi since 1986. Been to countless concerts, slept overnight in arena parking lots to get tickets, all that jazz, and I absolutely hate these new renditions.Judging from the overall ""star"" average on Amazon, however, it appears that I'm in the minority, which is interesting. Most of my criticisms have already been drawn out by other reviewers, so I won't waste any more space here.I can't fathom their rational to have released this tripe -- I would much prefer a super clear, well recorded acoustic album of their greatest hits."
2,unexpected twist - hated it,"I saw the song list and greatest hits in the title and bought it expecting the ""greatest hits"" in the form that made them ""greatest."" I was really sorry to hear that they were all re-made in a fashion that just was not my style. Nice try guys, but hated it. I did more research and bought ""crossroads"""
2,Acoustic Renditions,"This is pop metal sensation Bon Jovi's greatest hits album, except they are all played on acoustic guitar. Those familiar with the group's flavorful pop metal may find this not very satisfying because the energy is gone.One of the best looking frontmen in Jon Bon Jovi who made his comeback in movies. I wouldn't recommend it, but worth a listen or two."
1,"Terrible, save your money","The single worst album I've ever purchased.If you're looking for something to play in your elevator or doctor's office waiting room, this is what you're looking for. Think Bon Jovi music for senior citizens. Wish I could get my money back."
1,TERRIBLE!! AWFUL!! Save yourself some money don't buy it!,"DON'T BUY THIS!! If you are expecting ""Normal"" rock n roll Bon Jovi don't buy it. Listen to the songs on amazon, I purchased this thinking it was a greatest hits albumn! Its terrible! This will be going in the trash can! I won't even donate it to Goodwill! I wish I would have read the reviews about this before purchasing it from ebay!"
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","I am a huge Bon Jovi fan. I own all of the CDs including JBJ's solo efforts. I have videos, DVDs, and even a cassette-single from the 1980s. But this is by far the worst CD ever recorded. Not just the worst by Bon Jovi, but the worst in the history of the recording industry. Basically they went back and ruined a dozen Bon Jovi classics.Do not buy this. Do not download any of the songs. Do not rent this from a library. If someone offers this to you as a gift - politely decline. If you see it in a parking lot - pass it by, or better yet step on it."
2,Disappointment!,I wanted a Bon Jovi's greatest hits for Christmas and I was so excited to listen to all their songs I love..........and big disappointment. I buy greatest hits CDs because all the ORIGINAL greatest hits on one CD (seems obvious)
1,Awful,"This CD is awful! Every time I listen to it, I am waiting for it to pick up and it doesn't. Bon Jovi on Muzak! Save your money!"
1,If It Aint Broke-Don't Fix It,"I am a huge Bon Jovi fan and I'm always excited when they release a new CD. I rushed to get my copy of This Left Feels Right and, WOW, what a disapointment. I hate to say anything negative about the band and their music because I'm such a huge fan, but like I said ""If It Aint Broke - Don't Fix It!"
1,They forgot their roots completely!,For the truly old fans (that know them not only from These days or Crush) it was a big disapointment. I think they are completely sell-out. And the worst is that the music is too bad. THey ruined all their classics.Songs for sleeping. Chords changed completely. Save you money and don't buy it.
2,i can't stop laughing,"... i'm listenning to the CD right now. I bought it today thinking ""finally a new Bon Jovi out"".. after the first song, i was like ""this is a joke right????""... but its not. Some songs are ok (it doesnt get better than ""ok"" for me with this CD)..i liked ""it's my life"", and ""keep the faith""... but like another reviewer mentionned, you sometimes have to look at the cover to know what song they ruined this time. I love Bon Jovi - I have every CD of theirs, including the Young Guns Soundtrack - and i'll keep listenning to this CD hoping it'll grow on me, but till now, sorry it's just a bad joke. If you still want to buy this CD, you have to listen to it without thinking of the original versions - trying to sing with it is impossible - everything's different. I hope they do release a NORMAL acoustic CD, coz i love Bon Jovi."
1,Bon Jovi - This Left Feels Right,"What a waste of money and as far as I'm concerned this cd is a real disappointment !!!! At first I thought that this must be a joke or some kind of intro and at any moment the song , LIVING ON A PRAYER ,would kick in . WRONG !!!!! I listened once and actually threw the CD away .Instead of Bon Jovi's explanation of the CD inside the case , they should have given some insight into the type of music PRE -SALE ! If I wanted to listen to ballads ( not that I would want to )trust me I would not have bought Bon Jovi . P.S. One star is too high to rate this bomb !"
1,don't waste your money,"I HAVE LISTENED TO BON MJOVI SINCE HE START3ED HIS CARRER AND I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I WAS SO EXCITED BY THE TITLE MI COULD HARDLY WAIT TO HEAR IT. IT WAS SSSOOOOOOO BAD.....I COULD NOT REDCOGNIZE A SONG UNTIL IT WAS ALMOST HALFWAY THRU. ONE SONG SOUNDS LIKE THE NEXT...IF YOU DON'T MIND LISTENING TO HIS MUSIC AT HALF THE SPEED THEN THIS IS FOR YOU, THERE IS NO EXCITMENT IN THIS MUSIC AT ALL. I LISTENED HOPING HE WAS SRARTING MELLO AND WAS GOING TO JAZZ IT UP NO SUCH LUCK...THIS IS ONE CD OF BON JOVI'S I COULD DO WITHOUT."
5,"Bon Jovi ... not for the ""fair-weather fans""","This album is for the true Bon Jovi fan. Each song is scaled down to the roots and recorded from the heart. NOT THE ORIGINAL TRACKS! This is not a ""Greatest Hits"" CD. If you love Bon Jovi and appreciate their talent and love for music, this is an absolute must-buy. If not, stick to the original albums.On a personal note, I am a huge Bon Jovi fan. I have been a devoted listener since Slippery When Wet (I was 10 years old). I always buy -- and LOVE -- every single Bon Jovi album. I think this one is wonderful."
1,Waste of money,"When I put this CD in and listened to the first track I asked myself if I had bought the correct album. If you want to hear the original hard rock Bon Jovi then this album is NOT for you. These are artsy folk-type versions of the band's original songs, which I was not aware of when I bought the CD. I wish I had gone to Amazon first to listen to the tracks on the different albums so I could have chosen the one that was right for me. Total disappointment and waste of money."
1,What is this?? It's not the Bon Jovi I was expecting!,"WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!!!! The twist is that the ""real"" music isn't on here... This CD is what I would expect if it said live accoustic version. To even compare itself to the greatest hits it should have the hits on there. There is no ROCK!"
2,"""It's Just Wrong""","Maybe it's because I so much wanted to hear the original versionsof these songs unplugged--that I can't accept the new versions.The CD does grow on you but there are a few songs that no matterhow many times I listen to still give me the creeps--""Living on a Prayer""-- ""Bad Medicine""-yuck! and especially ""It's my life""I think the best song on the CD is ""Everyday""---I loved it on Bounce and am disappointed that it didn't get the attention itdeserved--It's a great song!I am a loyal Bon Jovi fan but still am wondering--what were theythinking?"
5,Love the Left turn,"From the moment I heard the ""samples"" on Bonjovi.com I loved this cd, when I first heard it was coming out, I was very disappointed that it was going to be another Greatest Hits, how many times does one have to get the same songs, but this greatest hits is its own, and adds great new twists to my old favorites."
3,Not what I expected.,"I enjoy when artists do remakes, to hear their new takes on their own music. In this case, they should have stuck with their first impression. While two or three of these songs are pretty good on their own, they still fail in comparison to the originals. And too many of them sound just like the rest. A little too country sounded for me (and I like all music). But Bon Jovi isn't a country act, and to turn rocking music into slow, blue-sy ballads just doesn't work for me. Jon does an injustice to his voice by not using it to it's potential. I'll pull out the old stuff and listen again instead of playing this oen again"
2,This Left Feels Wrong!,"He should have kept this cd a secret and not released it all!!!!!!!! There are some songs on there that are good, but for the most part, it's the worst CD I've bought in a long time. His rendition of ""Wanted Dead Or Alive"", which is song he wrote, is the worst I've heard. If feel that if you wrote the songs, you should be able to sing them as well and he can't. He sounds like a ""wannabe"" singer trying to emulate Bon Jovi and doing a horrible job of it.Bad Medicine should have been kept has the hard rocking song it is. Just as with some of the other songs that were performed as hard rock songs. An acoustic version of some songs just does not work and this album proves it.If I were to give this album a grade I would grade a high D just because of the 12 songs on the CD, there are about three or four that are good. But as for the rest of the songs, they should have left them as they were."
2,Bon Jovi Is Going Downhill,"I just want to say that I have been a Bon Jovi admirer for years. They are without a doubt my favorite band. But other than ""It's My Life"" the last few years have been bad. As well as the early 90's. This is when the boys from Jersey started singing to the ladies. They got their hair all gelled up like little girls. Jon and Richie are my boys, but change your hair (esp. Jon). You guys need to go back to pre 1988 when you were just starting out and not make your record to try to be so commercially successful.This new CD is a perfect example. Listen to Wanted Dead or Alive in this CD and than in Slippery When Wet. Guys if it ain't broke don't fix it. You guys need to go back and bring out some new stuff with the old sounds. None of this new guitar stuff, none of these news sounds, none of the new Bed Head. Go out and make yourself an album with the same rock and roll you started with. Make an album that will not only bring you a million faces....but rock them all."
1,How to ruin your own songs,They must be joking. Only 2 songs have survive the slaughter: It's my Life and The Distance(which is a bonus track and they are not great just good. They have made many of the best Hard & Pop Rock songs ever and now they come and ruin a bunch of them. What's the point? I'm a big Bon Jovi fan and I feel bad for them. They lost it. It's depressing!
1,Let me find the best way to say this...,This is about the worst CD I've ever heard. Thankfully I didn't pay for it. I thought all Bon Jovi CD's were supposed to be good. Who in their right mind thought that this would be a good idea???
2,I was truly dissapointed,"Being a die hard BonJovi fan, I couldn't believe how horrible the new remix could be. It's almost painful to listen to. You keep waiting for Jon to break out into the familiar version that everyone loves and it never happens. Although they feel that an accoustic CD would be an easy way out, I was really looking forward to it. I'll never tire of hearing BonJovi live! They are undoubtedly one of the best live performing bands and an accoustic CD would have been so uplifting to listen to. Very Dissapointing. As one of their biggest fans, it pains me to give such a bad review."
1,What were they thinking....,I am amazed that these awesome songs were twisted into such a horrible version. I bought it expecting it to be a collection of my favorite rock out songs and it ended up being a Barry Manilow version. I bought it in a store and did not listen to it first. MY MISTAKE! They would do this to thier own songs????
1,"I have listened to it, will never purchase it",As a Bon Jovi fan since Run Away it is sad to say that I will never purchase this album. My sister owns it so I got a chance to listen to it. The redos are redonts
1,"If it ain't broke, DON'T fix it!","Please, listen to the samples before you purchase this album. There is a reason there are 108 used disks for sale here! I was looking for a Bon Jovi greatest hits collection to buy so I could work up some songs on the guitar. This oughta teach me to slow down and read some reviews before I click ""add to cart"". Jeesh! What a let-down!"
3,Great CD (with one thing missing)!,"This is a great CD, and I really enjoy it. For new buyers you should know that it's all accoustic. It's still good, but if you're looking for Bon Jovi's original hits, this probably isn't the CD you want."
2,Painful...,"My parents, who are now in their 70s, used to listen to radio stations that played ""easy listening"" or ""EZ Listening"" music when I was growing up. I think ""EZ Listening"" was the predecessor or ""muzak"". Regardless, please don't let my children think that their mother listens to watered down versions of classic, rock and roll favorites. I don't want to hear this in an elevator....but I think I could. Jon and Richie ""unplugged"" was classic..as VH1 as all reminded us...but this is a weak attempt to recreate the same effect.Loved Crush in 2001 and Bounce in 2003...would love to hear some new classics in the old vein in 2005..."
1,What the heck?,"All I have to say is that this is freakin ridiculous. The original versions of these songs are awesome and this album makes them crappy sauce. Just buy the original, don't waste your money on this."
1,Worst.Cd.Ever!,"I'm so saddened by this CD. I cannot believe how truly bad these songs are. I have loved Bon Jovi for at least half my life and this just ended the love affair. The vox are bad, all the little extra guitar twangs and effects are out of place. Several songs are barely recognizable except the lyrics. They did no justice to their own songs, these at one time may have been their greatest hits.. but not now."
1,This left sounds bad!,I have been a big fan for many years but I'm very disappointed with this acoustics cd. All the hits re-worked and re-worked pretty bad. Sounds like he is singing from an intercomb. The unplugged era is about over with too. This stuff is so outdated...Buy The Crossroads cd instead if you want their hits...it has the originals.
1,"Turned left, and nothing went right","This is an attempt at art gone terribly wrong. Billed as a ""greatest hits"" album, but a better description would be ""how we killed our greatest hits"". As a Bon Jovi fan since Runaway, I was appalled by the garbage they have the nerve to sell. It seems like they think they can take good music, kill it on purpose, and watch the fools buy it and say how good it is. Unfortunately, I bought it, but I will never say it is even remotely decent. Not since New Jersey has this band done anything good! The music is mundane, and the vocals sound like someone just shot the cat. This disc after one listen has found a new home, in my trash can."
1,Bon Jovi Sucks,"Get real people. No matter what kind of music you like, whether it is rock and roll, rap, r&b, country, bluegrass, or jazz, there are talented folks out there. Jon Bon Jovi, however, just sucks PERIOD. His music is for those too ignorant to change the radio station from the top 40 pop hits that 12 year olds like to a real radio station. For the sake of mankind, I hope people begin to realize this so I do not have to see another crappy opening ceremony to the Daytona 500. I would seriously rather watch a puppet show for kids."
2,One theft... but otherwise their best stuff,"The song 'It's My Life' is an almost direct copy of the The Mission song 'Kingdom Come (Forever And Again) - see the album 'Grains Of Sand' (ASIN B000008IIZ).Apart from that, not much to add - Bon Jovis HAS made quite a few good songs, and many of them are featured on this compilation. They should stop now though before it becomes pathetic (never knew why they were called hardrockers anyway) and forced to copy more songs."
5,"""The Newest ""Old"" Songs In Rock","Yes, we may have already heard these songs before, but can you truly say that you have heard them. This Left Feels Right is the newest CD from Bon Jovi using older songs. Wanted Dead Or Alive is definitely my favorite song on the album but all of the songs are great!"
5,This Left Feels Right: Greatest Hits with a Twist.,The Twist is perfect! All songs Twist in the right direction.This band will be around for a very long time.
1,Only for those on a suicide watch,"I have been a Bon Jovi fan since 1987, so I was looking forward to listening to this CD. I was in for a major disappointment.Most of Bon Jovi's music is upbeat and cool. But these songs have been done in a way than they are mourneful and depressed. Only one song on the whole CD was not ruined by the new style.Unless you are contemplating suicide, and want something else to listen to besides Kansas' ""Dust In The Wind"", avoid this CD like the plague, especially if you are a Bon Jovi fan."
1,Disappointing,"I missed the part of the title that said Greatest hits ""with a twist"". Was expecting just the songs I know and love. The words are the same but the music different, slower. Not a fan at all :-(."
2,A little disappointed,"I am a huge bon jovi fan, but was a little let down by this CD. I like their music as hard rock etc.....not accoustic style. I didn't even recognise many of the songs."
5,This Left is sooooooo Right!!,"I first listened to this album with mixed feelings - a couple of friends had listened to some of the tracks on the website and were not at all impressed.After hearing the CD for myself all I can say is WOW!!!!The hits have been completely stripped back and approached from a totally different angle and the result, for me, is awesome.Anyone who was blown away by the acoustic version of Living on a Prayer that Jon and Richie did at the MTV awards a few years back will love this album. It is more mellow than we are used to from Bon Jovi but they obviously knew what they wanted and chose the right producer to help them with this project.Pat Leonard, who has also produced a couple of the Unplugged albums, has taken Bon Jovi on a complete 90 degree left turn with this album.So if you want to completely rediscover Bon Jovi, buy this album and you will listening to it for years to come."
2,Huge Letdown,"Most Bon Jovi loyalists should enjoy the new album ""This Left Feels Right"". But for some of us, it is a major disappointment.To begin with, it was quite simply falsely advertised, or at the very least mis-promoted. With a subtitle ""Greatest Hits With a Twist"", the album gives you the impression that you are getting the long-awaited acoustic greatest hits collection Jovi fans have been pining for, without steering you in the correct direction before you purchase it. The band has simply put a sometimes interesting but often odd ""twist"" on their songs, it's as if they were just fooling around in the studio and decided to release it. Experimentation is one thing, but not at the expense of your classics."
3,Not the soundtrack from the DVD,My wife wanted this because she thought it was the soundtrack from the DVD. Unfortunately there are more songs on the DVD than the CD. The DVD is a live performance in Atlantic City while the CD is a studio recording and the performances are very different. Not as good as the DVD in my wife's opinion. Which is the only opinion that matters ;-).
1,Truth in Labeling,"I am a huge Bon Jovi fan. I bought this CD in Wal Mart and there was absolutely NO indication on the label that this CD was anything other than a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation. I was disappointed. Be warned, if you are looking for the Bon Jovi you are used to, do not buy this CD. If you want to hear them try their hand at accoustic folk/ballad style singing of the songs you are used to ""rocking"" to, then feel free to give it a try...I should have looked on Amazon for a description before I bought it at the store, but it was an impulse buy. Still, like I said, there should be a warning on the label that this is NOT the Bon Jovi we know..."
2,Is there a satisfaction guarantee? I'd like a refund!,"I'm a huge Bon Jovi fan and after reading through a few of these reviews, maybe I'll have to give the CD a few more listens. I really hope it grows on me because right now I am thoroughly disappointed. My first instinct was this was a sell out to reach the 100 million albums sold mark. My second instinct was the Jersey boys are finally growing old and had to turn the music down. Regardless of the intention, I prefer the songs they way they were originally done. This is far too slow and boring, nothing like the awesome unplugged remakes of ""Dead or Alive"" and ""Livin' on a Prayer"" we're all familiar with. I agree with another reviewer- This left feels really wrong! Make it stop!"
1,This left feels really wrong,"Really this CD is the worse release by the band ever. Either the rumors about JBJ not working with a band and not having much chemistry with the rest of the band specially Richie is true..Or the guys have no idea what their roots are anymore... Either way, this looked like just a poor attempt to make some money"
2,Pure Disappointment,"I am a diehard Bon Jovi fan, and am totally disappointed in this album. ""It's my life"" is the exception, it's terrific. Who would have thought you could turn that song into a ballad and have it be so good. ""Bad Medicine"" is awful, what were they thinking. ""Livin' on a Prayer"" is one of my favorite songs, ruined by this horrible woman singer. Richie's guiter is great, Jon's singing is nothing special. Come on guys and get something moving again!"
1,"We love you guys, but what possessed you to do this??","Not at all what I expected. In fact I grabbed it the moment I saw it thrilled to see something new from Bon Jovi. Needless to say I was a bit dismayed after hearing the first 10 seconds. Did we need to add an outside voice on Livin' on a Prayer. I don't think so. Listening to this is like listening to nails on a chalk board. Love the guys, but what were they thinking!! I've even tried what others have suggested and have tried to let it grow on me, BUT, it just aint happenin'. Time for the boys to get back into the studio and crank out some new tunes reminiscent, but NOT the same and more upbeat. This last one has left me somewhat depressed. :("
1,Do they need the money??,"This was originally supposed to be a LIVE Acoustic album. Then they switched gears and said they would put out a studio accoustic album. THEN they changed again and released this garbage. These re-worked hits are pathetic, sad, and ABSOLUTELY AWEFULL!! What were they thinking? When is this awesome LIVE band going to give the fans an accoustic album? This Left Feels Wrong as one of the other reviewers stated. This is a total waste of time and money! Totally GARBAGE!!"
4,Interesting arrangements of old and recent hits.,"The first time i did hear the slow piano version of ""Its My Life"" i was on a cruise and was inmediately hooked by it. All the songs do not work out but even the lame ones, has some to offer. The cd includes a variety of songs, mostly old hits by the band, and some rarities. If you are a Bon Jovi fan or not, this is a good place to begin.Bon Jovi is a band that has so many unreleased recordings, that maybe there was no need of this cd, but i am glad they did."
1,Ruined Hits,"I believe I understand the premise behind this CD...Jon Bon went to his manager and was like: ""What if I take all my hits, and then put a twist on them to make them sound like crap""Honestly, it's bad..buy a greatest hits CD instead."
1,WTF?,This blows... come up with something new. It's like turning turkey into 8 different things the day after Thanksgiving. You guys aren't Vanilla Fudge... what the hell? Stupid bastards.
4,Bon Jovi,"The new greatest hits CD is good. You have to listen to it a few times in the cd deck before it attaches to you. Jon could've done a better job. It seems to me that he tried change his voice. If he would've kept the same voice he used in the original version of always on every song at the slow pace of this cd it would've been a five star review. ""It's my life"" is the reason to by the cd. Unbeleivable! I wisch every remake came out as good ast this one did. Anyways a worthy buy"
1,total waste of money,"Wow, what a disappointment! I bought this at our local electronics store and how I wish I had come to amazon first! There is nothing on the album cover to indicate that it is the hits ""with a twist"". Only ""This Left Feels Right: Greatest Hits"" is on the album so I was expecting Bon Jovi not whatever you call this. I learned my lesson! Thank you Amazon for giving us tracks to sample and very detailed descriptions of the albums. Customer for life..."
1,Not for Bon Jovi Fans,"This album does not sound like Bon Jovi at all. If you like his work, do not purchase this CD because it sounds completely different from all of his original works. I am really disappointed."
1,Hey Jon/Richie you owe me $12 for buying this junk,"Not sure what the band was trying to do here. Cover their own songs and make them sound as close to some band playing the Holiday Inn in Wichita on a Friday night.Before I listened to this I ripped it for my MP3 player, as soon as I listened to it I immediately removed it from my drive as it probably took up 14 cents worth of hard drive space, too much for this content"
5,Just a master piece,"This is a fab cd for all Bon Jovi fans. When I first heard the tracks I was not sure. As soon as you here the classics, which are some of Bon Jovi's best, that are now completely different but are just as great NO they are far better. A great inprovement on such well loved tracks. You must have this in your collection. The DVD bonus with this CD is also fantastic."
2,Please read the reviews before buying this CD!,I had only read the first few reviews and hadn't realized the songs had been remade with a much slower tempo. I kept waiting for the songs to pick up but it sounded very much like they were trying to incorporate a little country into these well known pop singles. I was disappointed and wouldn't recommended this CD if you are looking for the original sound.
3,Great Songs,"I haven't bought this CD yet but have heard all the tracks on AmericanXS. Since I own all of their other albums, I will be buying this one too, but overall I give this one an average rating. Wanted was disappointing in this CD's rendition with the extra effects. A much better version would have been just Jon and Richie with two acoustic guitars but I guess they've done that enough over the years. There was a great version on an EP way, waaayyy back but is definitely in the hard to find category now. Bed of Roses and I'll Be There for You won't disappoint and Everyday is pretty cool too. For the avid fan this is a nice addition to your collection, but for new fans, I recommend you go back and check out everything from ""Slippery When Wet"" onward."
2,Not for your vintage Bon Jovi fan,"I was excited to listen to this CD since it offered up so many great Bon Jovi songs. I was disappointed with the album. It's not that I dislike an acoustic, mellow approach, which has worked for many artists like Eric Clapton, but this remake lacks the energy of the original songs. John's voice sounds abrasive on many of the tunes and the synthesis between drums, guitar, and keyboards doesn't quite work.You have to give 'em credit for trying something new but I'll stick with Jovi straight up."
2,What is this?? Don't change a good thing!,"I am a true Bon Jovi fan and I was very disappointed with this album. Sorry guys! The original songs were great, keep them that way."
1,Bull S__T,"This is hard to say when you have supported Bon Jovi's music everywhere you've been, but this is truly S__T.How on earth have they delivered such a piece of S__T!.They will have to work very hard to have me as a fan again."
1,What a let down!!!!,"I was SO disappointed when I listened to this CD! It's a remix of the songs. They are done acousticly and it is not worth buying. I love Bon Jovi, but this was a HUGE disappointment! I am not happy with this CD at all."
3,"good, but no great","this album was good, it has reworked some of bon jovis greatest hits, like livin' on a prayer, and always... hearing the song in different ways, can help you appreciate the meaningful lyrics, but you do lose the fiery rock passion that is bon jovi with these re-worked songs, and could have been sung by any pathetic boy band... if you are a bon jovi fan, then this is an ok cd, if you are not a bon jovi fan, u could like this cd, but this is not the greatest, far from the greatest bon jovi album out their. my advice is get the bounce or these days album, or if you prefer the heavier rock legend of bon jovi then may i suggest slippery when wet, new jersey and 7800 degrees faerhenheit."
1,pathetic doldrums,"mellowed down, boring redo of the original music. if you are a bon jovi fan, skip this pathetic waste of money."
1,Terrible,"I have been an 80's rocker girl forever, and what makes Bon Jovi is his passion. I felt absolutley none of that on this CD. I have tried to listen to it and just can't bring myself to do it. It's terrible."
5,A must have for all Bon Jovi fans!,"If you're a Bon Jovi fan, this CD is one you must buy. If you're not a Bon Jovi fan, I still think it's a CD you should buy. The Jersey boys take their old favorite songs and put a new spin on them all and in the end, they create an album that makes one rediscover Bon Jovi all over again. The songs are amazing. There is a whole new style to them all that makes me forget that used to be different songs at one time. The songs show their growth over the past 20 years. They take the big time rock songs they're famous for and change them, not just in a ""Unplugged"" way like that did on the MTV awards years ago, but with a whole new feel to the songs that adds a deeper meaning to them all. Richie's guitar playing is amazing on this CD as is Jon's almost haunting voice in a lot of the songs! The CD is very enjoyable and a must have!"
3,Not Really Greatest Hits,"As a long time Jovi fan I was looking forward to having some of my favorite songs all on one CD. I put it in the CD player looking forward to rocking out to some classics. Instead, what I heard was completely remastered versions of some of my favorites. While I don't hate this CD, I was sorely disappointed. If you're looking for a Greatest Hits CD, DO NOT BUY THIS! If you're into the new trend of stripping down music to a more pure form, then go ahead. I think that this CD will be received much like ""Let It Be, Naked"" (not that Bon Jovi is ANYWHERE close to being the same as the Beatles). What I mean is that some fans will appreciate the remastering of classics and others will be put off by it. Buyer beware!"
1,corny&still trying to run the same ole formula,Bon Jovi reminds me of David Allen Griers Blues routine on the show when He would say I got a New Song you want to hear it hear it goes.now doing the Unplug thing was cool back in the late 80's when they did it on the MTV Awards Show.but they still are stuck in a funk.vocally they sound tired&this Project seems like a Safe cash in more than anything else at this stage of there careers.
1,The worst,Can it get much worse then this? I would rather listen to John Tesh cover the entire career of Yani. Terriable.
1,This left feels right is wrong!,"Now we got 3 versions of livin' on a prayer and not much effort to create it. Old songs with a twist of boredom. Great voice in deed but only worth buying for like a wedding or break up. Taking a long break and cancelling a show, a FIRST, are they loosing their touch, what a shame. Even Jon Bongiovi's first CD is better than this."
1,Don't even waste your money for this cd,"This cd kind of sucks, I've been Bon Jovi fan for a long, long time, it's kind of sucks that they can't come out with new songs, but if you think about their Bounce cd that really sucked too, why don't you guys just stop making jock out of yourselves and just stop putting out crappy music, or give up your credit cards, and all of your money, and go hungry for a month, and remember how to write good songs"
2,This left feels wrong,I know the whole story behind this album. A couple of Bon Jovi songs with a twist. OK but sorry this is not my cup of tea. Bought the album today and it's a waste of money. The only song that can keep up with the original is It's My Life. The bonustrack is OK but the rest.... Sorry. Don't get me wrong here I'm a very big Bon Jovi fan!! (a collector)but I really don't like this one. I've heard so many unplugged versions of Bon Jovi classics and they are all fantastic but this left feels wrong.
1,Bon Jovi - The Ballads,"That's what they should have called it. Don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fan of the band, but I hate this CD. What a waste of $$$$. Give us a good ol' rock & roll CD like what we used to get from Bon Jovi and haven't seen in a while."
5,Very Different,"This album is very different. It is relaxing and the way the songs are sung it just sounds so beautiful. The more I listen to it the more I LOVE IT. ""It's My Life"" just makes me want to cry the way Jon Bon Jovi sings it. All I have to say is I LOVE IT.....GO BUY IT"
3,This left eventually feels right,"Bon Jovi are rock legends. I don't normally like when bands change original classic songs for a different sound, it just doesn't work but Bon Jovi did a good job in creating new versions of the classics.There's no remake of any songs from These days ?"
3,It's ok.,"Great band, not so great cd. When you hear a song a thousand times and grow to love it, hearing it in a completely different arrangement makes you want to say ""Hey, that's just wrong!"" What works best here is when the songs stay true to the originals, like ""Bed of Roses"" and ""Always"". But even these are quite subdued and you know that Jon is holding back vocally. A must for the true fan, but if you're new to the band, get ""New Jersey"" or ""Slippery When Wet"" instead."
4,Different & Risky,"Not being a hard core Bon Jovi fan...I found these songs to be very soothing. Having listen to their previous recordings, the different spin they have on these songs is refreshing. While most of the reviewers seem to dislike this change...I applaud the risk they have taken and hope they continue to take more. By the way, the song ""Bad Medicine"" in this version is much better than when sung originally."
5,You people call yourselves Jovi fans?,I can't belive how many bad reviews this album got. Like Metallica's ST.ANGER this cd is good in it's own right. In my opinion Wanted Dead or Alive is better here than on Slippery.Even though I can't say the same for the other songs on here they all rock! (But then agian anything these guys put out rocks)
2,"That left may have felt right, but Jovi made a wrong turn","The songs are okay, but if you have heard them before, the way they were originally put out, you will probably agree that Bon Jovi has made a mistake by going acoustic. This CD you will love, or you will hate."
1,Horrible!!!!,"Normally I don't write reviews, but I have to write a few words to confirm all the reviews here... Since when Bon Jovi was about slow and melancholic piano music???? I really like most of the songs in its original versions. But why he had to ""twist"" mystifies my mind..."
1,wtf?,"OMG, I WISH I would have read the reviews before placing my order for THIS CD. Complete waste of my $9.99 (would have rather spent it on 3 gallons of gas for my Jeep). I even had 3 other people ATTEMPT to listen to the CD and they couldn't even get past the first song. Let's see....how would I say this in ""Bon Jovi Terms"".....oh, yea, ""BAD MEDICINE!"" Doesn't even deserve a 1 star but I had to otherwise I wouldn't be able to submit this review."
2,BE FOREWARNED,"These songs are not at all the originals. Do not buy the CD if you are looking for the classic rock style Bon Jovi has had in the past. This CD is completely mellowed out, and none of the songs stay true to Bon Jovi's energetic style. It's good, but just not the same."
1,Not What I Thought,"This was not at all what I thought I was getting, I really wished I had read the reader reviews. I thought I was getting the classics, I had no idea that the ""twist"" would be a mangling."
2,uggh...,"Interesting experiment Jon, please don't do it again.Well there are a few bright tracs that give this the 2 stars."
2,Disapointed,"I did not like any of the songs on this album. It really only ranks 1 star, but I'll give a point for trying something new.""This left feels right"" sounds like it was done by a high school cover band trying to be artistic. Ranks WAY below Tesla (see ""Five man acoustical jam"" for those of you younger then 30).I am a Bon Jovi fan and bought this without reservation. I suggest you sample the songs before you buy."
2,This left doesn't feel right!!!,"I am a pretty big Bon Jovi fan. It's the first hard rock I ever discovered, but this cd is probably their worst effort yet. I bought it a couple days after it came out, and I was very disappointed. Even after a few of the songs grew on me, it's still pushing it to give it a 2.5 out of 5. This would have been a five star Greatest Hits if there wasn't a ""twist"".I would disagree with recommending this to hard core Bon Jovi fans. I think you'll hate it. I would say buy this if you're new to Bon Jovi. But even then, you're still missing out on the real versions of these hits. What have you done with the classics Jon!!!????"
1,This left feels wrong,This album is a sham. The remix is tamed and sounds like elevator music. For the most parts the remixes don't go with the words and take all of the fun out of the music. It is awful when a very fan friendly band like Bon Jovi takes advantage of its fans by putting out rehased music. Work on some new stuff fellas.The reviews were promising but were incorrect in saying real fans would like this. They should hate it and maybe newer fans (36+) will like it. Bon Jovi isn't built for hold music and this is EXACTLY what this is.
2,When something is right don't fix it....,"This is possibly the worst cd I have ever heard from a good band. I do not know what they were thinking, but I do not recommend it at all. Although there are a few good songs, I shared it with several other fans who would not even listen to any of the songs in whole, which I did thoroughly. If they had used this approach on a whole new set of songs, I think it would have been incredible."
1,This left feels wrong,"I have listened to the album and gone to the live DVD taping. I just cannot force myself to like this album. The acoustic DVD that came with the album was excellent so it's not that I object to change. I think it is a real shame that such a talented band has been reduced to performing such weak and lifeless music. Rumour has it that they will be cutting a new album and going on tour in 2005. Let's hope it is real rock n' roll. For now, save your money."
4,Way to go!!,"I have to say first that when I listened to this CD the first time I was not sure how to take it. As a true Bon Jovi fan I stepped back I tried to understand this change and began listening to these songs as if I had never heard them before. I especially love Wanted, Always, Bed of Roses, Keep the Faith, Born to be my baby, and Lay your hands on me. I was so used to hearing Ritchie sing Livin' on a Prayer that it was hard to accept another person singing with Jon. After reading the interview done by David Wild with Jon and Richie I had a better understanding of the concept behind this change. The guys still look great and one of the things that I love the most about the band is how much you can tell they love their families. Rock on guys!!"
4,this left feels just right:),"i don't want to say a lot. but... i feel like listening it nonstop and i do it whenever it's possible for me. it's just beautiful music, modern music. Well, it's got nothing to do with hair rock of 80s and THIS IS GREAT!.I am Bon Jovi fan since 80s, but i' m sure that i won't be with the guys today if they were living still there in 80s with no changes through the years.A little advise : listen to the songs like if they are completely new ones. Don't compare versions. You give love a bad name makes me smile because of clear resemblance to one of my favorite artist Tom Waits%). Also i found Always much more touching and.. well.. real maybe, that original version never was for me. it's my life - yes! it's MY life. i admire new arrangement of ivin' on a prayer, but female vocals a bit spoil the song. Listen guys, enjoy and forgive my english. hope you understand feelings anyway."
2,what happened?,"maybe you remember when bon jovi used to rock. apparently, they've all settled down and decided to be tame and quiet instead of rocking. maybe you remember listening to ""livin' on a prayer"" and singing along at the top of your lungs with your fist in the air. but then you listen to this album and you just get quiet while your hand falls down, sad, into your lap. because the rock is gone. the edge is gone. the album sounds good by itself, but in comparison with the originals, the rerecorded songs are shabby and disappointing."
4,Fresh Jersey Boys,"Love the new cd by the best boys outta Jersey! The classic songs performed a ""left"" way is refreshing. Way to go, guys!"
4,Wonderful,He's out did his self again. This cd is wonderful it's a mixture of old and new Bon Jovi. a really refreshing cd.
2,Left waiting for the real Bon Jovi to show up,"I was so excitied about getting the new Bon Jovi CD that I rushed into buying it without waiting for the reviews. I'm sorry to say I am very disappointed. I wanted the CD to workout with on my treadmill, upbeat music keeps me walking,,,well this CD was putting me to sleep. Everytime a new song came on I felt like screaming NOOOOOOOOO...don't butcher this one.. The only song on the CD I liked was EVERYDAY the rest I just can't listen to. I was left wondering if it was John Bon Jovi really singing the songs."
4,Bon Jovi Took A Left ...And It it feels alright,"Ive been a huge Bon Jovi fan from the time of Bon jovi 1st cd. The band I feel has evolved and grown throughout the many years and always mananged to stay current and fresh with the times . On this cd ""This Left Feels Right"""" they pretty much mananged to stay well on the right path . This cd was a labour of love for the band and they wanted to try a hits with a twist . They manaaged to pull this off nicely , with ""Wanted "" (nice change of pace) and ""Its My Life"" . Jon does some nice vocal twists on ""KTF"". This I feel is for the more heavy Bon Jovi fan . If your looking for another """"Slippey When Wet 2 "" or "" New Jersey "" you wont find it here , but if you looking for something fresh and unusual from them then this ""left"" will feel ""right"" to you . Give it a listen you wont be dissapointed ."
1,"OK boys, stop fooling around and get back in the studio...","I've been a fan for 20 years and I'm getting too old for this nonsense. I'm a die-hard fan who loves you guys more than life itself... but what were you thinking? We're not going to hold it against you, everybody makes mistakes, now let's move on and get back to the great stuff we're used to."
3,They work,"I mean, it's a nightlight. It lights up at night. It works. It's not the brightest, but it does shed light at night. We used these in places where some light helps, but a lot of light isn't desirable. I got some LED night lights for the places where more light was needed (stairs)."
3,Worked quite well for 10 years,"When I got this night light in 1999 it was great. Very dim so as not to destroy your night vision when you encountered it, but bright enough to see by. In other words, perfect for my bathroom. Over the next year though it's slowly gained a lot of dark spots, probably because this bathroom is much more humid then most have been historically. These dark blotches eventually have made it useless, but that doesn't bother me after 10 years of use. What bothers me is the lack of a pass through outlet. Since you leave this thing on 24/7 it always takes up an outlet, and bathroom outlets are typically at some sort of premium. So simply because of the lack of an outlet that an electric toothbrush can plug into I'd avoid it. If you have 3 or more outlets in your bathroom though and they aren't needed this might be a good selection, it was a pretty solid light for 10 years."
1,Just received this Saturday--was stoked...,"And the SACD/CD won't play at all. Have tried 3 different players and my iMac.This review is not based on the music, sonics, or anything else. Just a DUD CD."
4,"Catchy album, interesting sounds, great songs.","This is definitely a well put together album. I would give it five stars, since nearly every single song on it is worth buying the album for, but I have to say that, for me, it has less replay value than other albums. Perhaps it's because I listened to it a whole lot, but after a while, the songs became predictable (moreso than usual) and would eventually get stuck in my head in a pretty bad way. Personal experience only.Other than that, god damn, they certainly knew what they were doing when they made this one. Every song rivals the other, every songwriter shines his best. The instruments float around like a mist throughout the whole album. There's definitely something magical about it. A high shining beacon in the era of 60's psychedelic prog pop, or whatever the hell you want to call it."
3,Anyone Else's Copy Missing The 2 Bonus Tracks ?,"Packaging talks about them in great detail, but actual disc only has the original 9 tracks !!! What's up with THAT ?"
1,Just a little cupped,This album and cover has a nice cup in them.Checked on line to see if there was a way to flatten out the vinyl.There is. One was cost $99.The other is two sheets of glass 20 in SQ.Haven't tried it yet. Will as soon as I get to the hardwear store.So ship in a LP Box if your shipping any vinyl records.
5,Yet Another Great Moody Blues Album Is Now Even Better,"EVERY GOOD BOY DESERVES FAVOUR, yet another great CD by the Moody Blues, is now even better, thanks to warm, thick remastering and two bonus cuts. The rocker ""The Story In Your Eyes"" is now clearer and more interesting, whereas ""You Can Never Go Home"" now inspires me even more to put looking good for pretty actresses as a higher priority than attending Thanksgiving Dinner at my old school for my 15th graduation anniversary, because the lyrics are easier to understand and the instrumentation carries them along even better than on the 1997 remastered version. This is one reissue you definitely should NOT pass up."
5,My favorite Moodies album,"This is probably my favorite collection of Moody Blues songs, although it's the one that's gotten the most flack for its perhaps overly-ambitious approach. I think it's also the most innovative and adventurous of all their albums, with the song-cycle theme over-arching the great individual tracks and tying them all together into one organic whole. Some of the most beautiful Moody Blues songs are here--Procession, The Story in Your Eyes, and One More Time to Live. Whether it succeeds or not in its greater aspirations--such as the attempt to encapsulate the entire history of mankind in one 50-minute album--this is still a great collection of many of the Moody Blues' greatest songs."
1,ATTENTION AMAZON - Bad Production Run!,"Note, this one-star rating is for the product, not the artist/music.Hoping that I would receive one from a previous production run, I placed an order anyway. No such luck, mine does not play in standard or SACD players.It looks to me like the bad ones started showing up just this year. If you can be assured that yours is from an older production run, you are probably safe."
5,The answers to the universe,"""There's life in other worldsMaybe they'll come to usHelping Men to find the way. . .""""One day I hope we'll beIn perfect harmonyA planet of one mind.Then I can tell youAll the things inside my head. . .""I can't explain this album any better than the Moodys themselves. Awe inspiring!"
4,"Great Moodies Sound, Bonus Track Issue","The ""EGBDF"" remaster is as pleasing as the previous Moody reissues. However, there is an extra bonus track, ""After You Came"", listed in the booklet. This track is not listed on the outer sleeve, and is not on the CD. Otherwise this reissue would rate a 5."
1,Defective disc as per other purchasers,Received the disc and have tried it in various CD and SACD players and multiple PC's. None of the equipment will recognise or load the disc so it is not useable. Have arranged to return the disc.Would recommend that people avoid purchasing this item until Amazon can confirm that the bad batch has been weeded out and a new batch sourced.
2,A big drop-off for this fine band,"Just so you know where I'm coming from, I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era. Also, some of the material I've heard from 1981-1999 is good (if formulaic), but I am less familiar with it. With that said, the Moodies hit their lowest point with ""Every Good Boy Deserves Favour"" and ""Seventh Sojourn"". The only song on ""Every Good Boy"" that I enjoy is Justin Hayward's excellent rocker ""The Story in Your Eyes"". I award two stars to this album just because it contains this song. The other songs are either plodding and dull or sticky sweet, comparable only to the very worst of their prior material. If you are exploring the early Moodies' music, do yourself a ""favour"" and try any of their first five albums (see my other reviews for details). You will find rock that really rocks, and beautiful music that is fresh and original."
2,Every Good Boy Deserves Favour,Rather dissappointed with this title very few good tracks on the album very average production and recording no structure or theme to the album to tie it altogether.Maybe it's just my memory of the band that's really missing on their good tracks they are brilliant but everything else is just average.
1,Melatonin on CD,This CD really sucked. All the songs were very draggy and seemed like they would never end. Some songs were flat out fruity. It's not a good CD at all I'm afraid. My parents like it a lot(they're more into older rock)and I got stuck listening to it in the car. I almost fell asleep.
2,Disappointing!,"To my ear, this album, while having a few seconds here and there of pleasant music which tricks you into believing something good is about to happen, it instead leaves you waiting in vain for anything enjoyable, interesting or catchy. I bought this album, trusting the band would live up to their name. But a lot of the vocals are sung flat and a lot of the writing sounds like a song-writing attempt of 13 year olds with no musical talent. Steer away from this album. Those who praised it as a ""masterpiece"" ... well, I can only conclude that they never heard the album."
5,This is a great CD!,"Can't say much except that this is a great CD! I doubt that this review would even be helpful to anyone but all I can say besides getting it is that it comes highly recommended! Some may not like it but it hardly deserves only 1 star and if you do rate it as 1 star, you are either very pretentious or just ignorant to good music. Maybe one should start getting britney spears instead?"
4,Useful.,"So you look at this book and you think, Hey, that looks like a pretty good book. Maybe I should get that because I want to get published.At least that's what I thought.I got it, I read it, and I liked it. But I wish that instead of buying this, I'd bought a book more tailored to me. The most interesting part was the first, which gave information on how to write what you wanted to publish. The rest was uninteresting and it repeated itself often. Now I know that what I needed was a book for my beginning stages of writing."
2,Dont waste your time,"This book is essentially an advertisement for the services of ""Computer Education and Design"" as a training partner. The document doesn't give any amazing insight into how to go about the training plan, but merely tells you what CED would do (not how to do it). There are a few interesting ideas in there, but nothing you wouldn't pick up free on the internet."
4,May We Be So Faithful,"I read this book over 20 years ago, and it still comes to my mind even to this day. I highly recommend this book for those interested in what it would be like to live your faith under threat of physical suffering and death.I live in a land blessedFree from almost every painResting in a comfortable lifestyleMaterial riches displayed as gainI worship at churchWith nary a dreadLittle fear for my familyEnding up deadBut for many ChristiansWho live else whereTo stand for ChristBrings the ultimate price to bearDying by the hundredsEach and every dayTortured and murderedIn unspeakable waysWhile I strive to gatherAll the toys that I craveThey bury their loved onesIn desolate makeshift gravesPray they will be boldIn proclaiming their faithAnd meet death if need beWith Spirit-filled graceIf this has disturbed youAnd your day I did taintPerhaps I have jolted you to prayAnd remember suffering saints"
4,Quick and very good Read,"While not the equal of a ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Quo Vadis"", ""Martyr of the Catacombs"" presents a good story of a Roman official who seeks out the Christians during Decius's persecution and joins the faith himself despite the price he may have to pay. The reading is generally quick (I read it in one or two days if I'm not mistaken) and the story is a well conceived one. On the whole, not a masterpiece but a worthwhile and good read that I recommend."
3,its ok,"I was told it was a true story so I ordered it, there are a few non true statements in the book. But a good read. I would love to venture when I confirm accuracy of book."
3,Passion of the Christ...original songs inspired by film,"I purchased this CD to have access to a song called ""I See Love"". by Third Day, Mercy Me, and Steven Curtis Chapman. Additionally, there was a duet with Brad Paisley and Sara Evans, ""New Again"" which was a bonus!!! The entire CD was not for me, but those two songs were well worth the purchase. The CD was new and I am very pleased with the vendor's prompt service."
3,Some really good songs on it,"I love the first half of the cd, but after song 5 the quality of the music goes down."
4,"Instigator, pretty cool!","It is a little too big for a neck knife(overall length: 7.38""), but it's a good knife and I have gotten used to carrying it around my neck inside my shirt. It has a sleek, cool look to it! I have used it for various tasks and it feels comfortable in my hands. It is still razor sharp and will cut paper like nothing(i strop it occasionally), so it holds the edge well. I used to carry the CRKT Minimalist which is a more practical neck knife until I broke it....used it for just about everthing. This one is receiving the same type of torture and has held up well. I bought it to use as a neck knife and not as a boot or belt knife, so I would've given the Instigator 5stars if it was just a bit smaller. Overall, good knife."
2,Breathtaking,"The melodies, lyrics, instrumentation and, not least, vocals on this album are stunning. Justin Hayward and John Lodge's voices and guitar work are plaintive and emotive at the best of times but on these tracks, they are awesome. It's difficult to pick a best or favourite track from such an album but ""Who Are You Now?"" is simply heartbreaking. I bought this album firstly in its original vinyl format and recently bought the CD with the extra track, the single ""Blue Guitar"" (my vinyl copy was more than a little worn!). If ever there was a flawless album, this has to be in the running."
4,A forgotten good album,"My dad and my uncle are huge Moody Blues fans and for years have talked about the Blue Jays album, but I never heard it. While in London over the summer, I came across the album and had to buy it. So I did, and I was impressed. This album really shows that the true heart of the Moody Blues song writing is Justin Hayward and John Lodge. Their vocals blend together so well, and the guest appearances by other members of the Moodies help to make this album enjoyable for any Moody Blues fan while still distinguishing itself from the rest. Buy this if you like classic Moody Blues and would love to hear it with a twist."
4,Nights Winters Years,"The original idea for what would become Blue Jays was to have originally involved Justin Hayward and Mike Pinder during the Moody Blues hiatus. However, when Moodies producer Tony Clarke was brought in along with the same orchestra conductor that the Moodies used, Mike opted out fearing that it would be too similar in tone. In came John Lodge which might also explain why the majority of songs are Justin's. The album was recorded between June through December 1974 while featuring Justin & John being backed by Threshold band Providence. The bonus song on here is Blue Guitar which released as a Justin & John single is really just Justin backed by 10cc and was recorded before the album. The album was first released March 14, 1975 on Threshold Records. The overall feel of the album is a warm and relaxing listening experience with not a bad song among the bunch. Perfect for cold winter nights in front of the fire or heater."
5,Saved by The Music !,"Like so many others, I have saved the vinyl copy of this album in my closet for almost twenty years,hoping that one day I would find it on CD!I believe this is one of the most beautiful collection of songs I have ever heard ! It is my hope that others will discover what I have....That you truly can be ""Saved by the Music"" P.S. Merry Christmas Tasha !"
3,One star per song,"I give them a star each for ""This Morning"", ""Saved By The Music"" and ""I Dreamed Last Night"". They were reason enough for me to buy the album. Say what you like about the Moodies but they're not making any more like them."
4,"Better Hayward, for hardcore fans - with a touch of country.","If your a hardcore Moody's fan, this is a pleasant offering from Hayward (Lead Singer). A couple of the songs tease with country licks, but the dominant theme and sound is the mystical sound Moody fans find so haunting. A great addition to any Moody's collection."
4,"Lush,emotional,large scale melodi...tradional Moody Blues","I've been a fan of the Moody Blues since 1967, and while I'm not enamoured of some of their later albums, I count their first seven albums amongst some of the best music I've heard. And, like them, Blue Jays is a soaring, magical piece of work. It touches my spirit in a way that few albums have. I especially love ""Remember Me"", ""My Brother"" and ""Nights, Winters, Years"" - all of which are featured clips. The Moody Blues are not the most sophisticated lyricists, but there is a bold, rich over-the-top mysticism and emotionalism in their music that rises far above mere words. Enjoy this album late at night, it will shape your dreams."
3,just okay,"I'm a big Moody Blues fan and have most of their LPs. This isn't up to their standard. The voices are familiar and good, the orchestration is good too, but most of the songs lack the melodic quality of the Moody Blues at their pinnacle.Not awful, but not really good either. For die-hard fans only, I'd say."
5,blue jays,"I owned this album on vinyl and still have it, it is one of my favorites. The music and the voices!!!"
4,moodies lite,"I listened to this album during the 70's and, after hearing it again after so much time I noted how mild it is compared to the full group. It is for a palette that enjoys non-spicy melodies. Overall, it is agood example of these two members singing and writing panache. Enjoy!"
5,"mellow, melodious, lush and lyrical treasure of sound","Fabulous. I've had it for weeks now and am still playing it on repeat and liking it more and more. I like the Moody Blues a lot across all the decades, but somehow never heard of this one until Amazon targeted it to me. This is a mellow, melodious, lush and lyrical treasure of sound. No bad songs on it."
1,A shameful book,"What to think of somebody that writes ""all transsexuals rape women"" and more such nonsense? Ms. Raymond has no clue what gender and sex are, much less what it means to be transsexual. But she is quick to spread nonsense, lies, and hatred. A shameful book to be used only as an example of horrible bigotry."
1,Not what you think it might be,"This book is well out of date, so it's only valuable as a reference book. As a trans woman I find it rather wrong-minded. It is an attempt to show we are just 'men' WANTING to be women, and that we are doing this for all the wrong reasons. It claims strongly that the binary gender world is the correct model. Essentially it is elitist Woman Rights Femnazi propaganda. Pretty strong language I know, sorry, but you will understand all that if you read any part of it. It attempts to show how we are absolutely not women, just because we are born with a penis. A penis we never wanted but a penis regardless, grin. Read it and laugh - although there are probably still super-fem-rights women out there, in a modern world they are not so militant anymore."
1,A Definite Case for Recycling - Doesn't even rate 1 star,"Poorly written, illogical, circular arguments (if a m2F TS rises to a position of respect or responsibility in the women's movement, then it was because they were male(?) Oh, and if they don't, what is the cause of that, Ms. Raymond?) The women's movement was fragmented for many years because of this and other books of its ilk, serving the patriarchy by fragmenting us and keeping us in-fighting."
1,Transsexual Empire,I have read both versions of this book. I tried to have an open mind. Dr. Raymond is not trying to have any sort of constructive dialogue with transpeople. She is just pushing a transphobic form of radical feminism. It is possible to constructively critique the male dominated industry that regulates transsexual surgery but Raymond is more interested in attacking transsexual people. It is wrong to call her book the mein kampf against transsexuals but there is little positive in the book. Perhaps someday Dr. Raymond will realize that her book has hurt transpeople and revise it yet again.
1,"Nasty, vicious and ill-informed","Minus 100 stars!That one human being can express so much hatred and pour so much energy into hurting a group of people, who through no fault of their own find themselves in such a ghastly situation, turns my stomach.Gender Dysphoria is a curse and I personally would not wish it on my worst enemy. That I and others should be condemned for the results of a biochemical mix up in the womb is a sad indictment of our society.Ms Raymond you are a disgrace to woman kind."
4,the truth hurts,"I am an autogynephilic transsexual, and I think that Janice Raymone doesn't like people like me. And I understand why. Too often, delusional and aggressive and masculine trannies try to bully their way into women's networks. I think that the other kind of male-to-female transsexual (""homosexual transsexuals""--see Bailey's THE MAN WHO WOULD BE QUEEN) would fit in better, but they have no desire to do so."
5,Right on the Mark.,"This book was right on the mark. Janice Raymond is a leading cultural mind in radical feminist theorizing. Don't be fooled by the postmodern rhetoric in the past reviews. Janice Raymond addresses the issues in a clear, concise, and reasonable fashion -- from a feminist perspective, a perspective sadly lacking in today's world. Give it a read. The insight will surprise you."
5,and english review,"Just to let you know that I watched this film many years ago and have been ever since trying to get hold of it. It is a must to watch and brings to life the war when the americans came over to britain. I am still waiting for it to come out on DVD and trying to find it so i can play it on my vhs, ( i am from england and i will keep looking!!!!) Any way i highly recommend this and you will be very satisfied."
3,Did the Yanks Really Have That Much Free Time?,"As an Anglophile I found this film intesting and insightful. It helped me understand more about British culture and the way they really felt and still feel about us ""Yanks"". It makes me sad in a way.It's an okay film (though rather depressing) as far as love stories go, but did the Yanks really have all that time to go to the movies, fool around with girls, go on holidays, go to pubs, dances, and parties, etc.? If so, I find it kind of surprising the invasion was a success. My father was billeted with a family in Wales during WW II and when I told him about all the time they spent fooling around he just laughed. He said they spent most of the time being taught everything they could be to be prepared. I'm sure they had some free time but I think it's overdone in this film. Also, call me old fashioned but I found the Lynn Redgrave/William Devane affair distasteful."
4,Got this for my Grandmother,I dont know anything about this movie other than my Grandmother saw it and loved it but couldn't find it anywhere. Looked it up on Amazon and boom there it was. Used my one-click and had it in two days. Grandmother was happy and I was happy she was happy. Its not 5 stars because it wasn't a product for myself.
2,Last Things,"A oddly weak book, reads like the transcript of a series of lectures and notes. Booth must have written this in his last days."
2,Dissappointing Tech Support,"This product would not install correctly in Windows 2000. Symantec support policy is to either post problems to a bulletin board and wait 24-48 hours for response, or pay...to call them. The first method is slow, impersonal, an above all ineffective. The second method is offensive. Consumers have already paid for the product, they should not have to pay to get it to work correctly."
1,"Great, if you like Blue screens","Complaints about ""unexpected kernal mode trap"" error are unresolved. Run both programs and watch the blue screens arrive. Check out their site for this error report from others. There solution is there is no solution and has not been one for about six months now. Also there support must have blue screen problems, they don't reply."
5,Delicious.,Strawberry puffs=goodness. They also equal mad props when you remember that they are your wife's favorite candy and you can't find them in the store.
1,There Certainly is No Action in this Book!,"This book is nothing like what you would expect from Brockmann. It has absolutely nothing in it that you would buy a Brockmann book for. I to also disliked this book immensely, and had to force myself to finish it! I certainly hope this isn't a new trend that Brockmann is starting to follow."
3,Not the best...,"This was my first Brockmann novel and it intrigued me enough to go out and buy the rest. This led me to my peeve with Suzanne Brockmann--she goes to such painstaking effort to realistically describe the SEAL team and their endeavors, but leaves her attention to detail behind in developing her characters. Mike Muldoon does not age. In Over the Edge, Muldoon is 25 years old. Now nearly two years later (based on the fact that Starretts baby is 18 months old) Muldoon is still 25 years old.Nevertheless, I enjoyed the love story ( what there was of it) between Mike and Joan. There seemed to be alot of bouncing around--hard to keep interest in characters.I definitely recommend the other books in this series over Into the Night."
2,"Passable, wouldn't reread","This was my first book in the series to read, and I wish I had not bothered. Brockmann kept flipping between three different stories, and it broke the flow of the novel. Just when I had started to get interested in one set of characters, the book would switch back to one of the other sets. I started skipping entire chapters and going back later just so I could follow a complete story line to a more natural break. By the end, I just didn't care what happened, I just wanted it to be over."
1,How boring can one book be?!,"I can't understand how anyone liked this book. No romance, no suspense, so SLOW, boring, and lead characters (there were so many in the book I lost track of who they were) had no chemistry.This is by far the worse book I have read in a while. Don't waste your time with this entry in the series."
2,"Lacking, boring, not her usual...","I've read all of Suzanne Brockmann's Team 16 stories, and enjoyed all of them -- except this one. The pace was slow. The story was disconnected. It was too much about boring, pathetic Mary Lou. It contained little, if any, Navy Seal action. Suzanne's books are usually full of action, clever dialog, comaraderie between the Seals (who seldom featured in this novel), and at least some heat. I was disappointed in this one. My advice: skip it and read the previous ones."
5,I am hooked on this author!,Before last week I had never picked up one of the Troubleshooter books by Suzanne Brockmann but I am hooked now. I read the third book in the series and am now working my way through the rest. I loved Mike and Joan's story and I read this book in one sitting. Couldn't put it down!!
4,Audiobook Review,"I'll qualify this review by admitting that I'm a Brockmann fan. Even so, a bad reader can ruin a good book. Thankfully, that's not the case here. This is an excellent audio interpretation of a good book! Even though I read the book when it first came out, listening to the story brought a new perspective. Reader/actress Laura Hicks brings the characters to life. She keeps the story moving, and her interpretation of the most of the characters' voices was very close to what I imagined when I read this book (Mary Lou's Texas accent is a bit thicker than in my imagination). Ms. Hicks' timing, accents, and dramatic emphasis enhance the story but are not intrusive. According to author, Suzanne Brockmann, BBC Audio may be producing some of her earlier works. Hopefully, they'll use the same reader. If so, they'll be on my shopping list!"
1,HOO-YAH? Try....HOO-YUCK!,"Worst book by far but you just keep stringing us along! Just do Sam's story and be done with it! I don't really like his character very well in this book...he sure lost points with many of us FAITHFUL readers! And this going back and doing an older story...wasn't this done in another book. Sorry, I love your humor and writing but hated this book! Signed....Honestly Not Satisfied!"
3,My first Suzanne Brockmann read....,"I read the book, then came here and read reviews - and I have to say I feel better that I came away from reading it with mixed feelings. On the one hand, the interwoven substories kept me turning the pages to find out what happens next. On the other hand, there were times the story dragged. Some characters were quite full and rich (Mary Lou for example) and others rather cliche. That being said...when I read the teaser for the next book, it made me want to hurry up and get it. I think in the meantime, I'll go find ""Out of Control"" as another reader here has suggested...."
2,A Big Fan Gets Let Down!,"I would give her other books 4-5 stars, but not this one. As with many of the other reviewers I have also read all of Ms. Brockmann's books and this one was a real bummer. Characters and plot were slow moving,(although at the end of the book we find out why). I found myself looking at how few pages were left and thinking, ""A heck of a lot needs to be wrapped up here."" This book is just the begining of the rest of the story, which comes out in July 2003. The teaser pages at the end of Into the Night have me eagerly anticipating what awaits the main character from a previous Brockmann book. If you are already a fan of Suzanne Brockmann you will read the book anyway, if you are new to her try Out of Control or any of her others first."
3,Into the Night,The book was not to my tastes. This was a new author and I thought it sounded good but have not been able to get interested and the language is not something I want to wade through. Others probably will enjoy this author.
5,Kept Me Turning the Pages,"A nice mix of military, mystery, and likeable characters. I liked and respected these folks and I wanted to know what happened to them. I rooted for the protagonists to find each other, to work out their problems, and to save the president.I'm waiting for the next one to see how they are all doing."
3,Not very exciting...,"I usually like Suzanne Brockmann's books because of the interwoven stories. Not this one!1. I did not like the two main characters. Both seemed to need maturing.2. Sam really was irritating- when he was in the story.3. The WW2 addition to her story was unexciting, and I was glad there was very little of it.4. The plot was slow.Surprisingly, the character I did like was Marylou. I hope she comes to a happy ending in the next story."
4,It's okay.,"It's not as good as other Doonesbury books, because it focuses on a single plot rather than the usual interweaving of plots. Having said that it's still quite funny."
4,D.B. without a hat!,This is a collection of Doonesbury comic strips telling the story of D.B.'s return to the U.S. and recovery from a leg amputation due to injuries sustained in Iraq. The book contains the now famous strip (at least among Doonesbury fans) depicting D.B. without a head covering. D.B.'s struggles and his interactions with friends and family are touching and very funny. I look forward to following the story.
5,Making Memories Of Us,"I bought this on a flyer, just because it had Vince Gill on it. I was thoroughly surprised at the quality of the songs here.The ballads rip your heart, the rockers rock, and the comedy country makes you laugh and sing along.Crowell's voice only serves to highlight Vince all the more. Yet, the best ballad on here does not belong to Vince; instead it belongs to Crowell with Memories Of Us. On the other hand, Vince wins the best country groove award with Oklahoma Dust.Good memories here, folks. I did not expect to love this cd, but love it I do."
5,shades of coooool,"Turn the dial to full max, watch the windows blow out of the house, and ignore the loud pounding of your neighbors at the door while you listen to DEEP PURPLE............support your favorite artists"
5,Another great album,"If you are not a Deep Purple fan or want to become one, this is a good start. They don't make musicians like this anymore.."
3,"Interesting, but slightly one-sided","There truly is a vacuum that needs to be filled for more books on biotech. This book does a decent job filling this gap but falls short when it comes to telling both sides of the story. Author Michael Fumento spends most of his time explaining how biotechnology can provide the solution to most of the world's problems, namely: world hunger, disease, toxic waste, and the human life span. What's missing is any sort of criticism of biotechnology; he makes it seem like there are absolutely no negative effects to the proposed biotech solutions. Specifically, I found his all out praise of genetically engineered crops a little hard to digust (pun intended.)Bottomline: If you're looking for a critical treatise on biotechnology, this book is not for you."
4,BioEvolution: How Biotechnology is Changing Our World,"This book is definitely a great buy for people with a strong faith in the potential benefits of biotechnology, and also for those who do not know where we stand right now with this technology. It gives the reader the truth, discussing about the miracles that have taken place or are going to do so in the next few years."
4,Treasures in the Trunk: Quilts of the oregon Trail,"The item was in the condition it was reported to be and shipped properly. However, the edition I purchased was the the earliest published. Now, having seen the revised and updated edition, I would have much preferred it. Although much of the information is the same, the newer edition is much better organized,informative, and visually appealing.and"
3,Pleaseant instrumentals great for party background music!,"XM 43 XMU plays ""Elmer's Revenge"" once in, well, a blue moon. The rest of the album isn't much different from that one. No vocals, it's more jazz-tinged than out of the ""White man's blues"" mold of most Rock. Mature, sophisticated, relaxed, and only so slick, it's very positive and even hopeful. If you're a 30-something with a post-graduate degree in Manhattan or DC looking for background music for your party, consider it?If there's a flaw here, it's the sequence of the playlist. Once fixed, there's a really great time to be had here."
4,driven by the rythmic,"well, i bought that LP for Rodney Holmes and I am not disappointed. him and the bass guitarist help a lot. The guitars coul dbe a little more agressive, sometimes it doesn't go along well with the rythmic, it is too laid back, or the rythmic is too pushy.Lots of intro are the same type of drumfill...rodney can do better and remain musical without turning into a very technic thing.The production is strange, but the guitar never really explode, and it is really missing sometimes, sometimes it sounds cheap.However it is a good album, it could have been excelent"
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!! HUGE LET-DOWN!!,"Having anticipated this studio Cd for a long while, I have never been so disappointed in a CD as well as in Kimock. Most any of the live shows that you can download are better - why? Because they have more soul, more heart, more musical inspiration. This Cd is boring, flat and uninspiring and uninspired to say the least. It is nothing more than Kimock aural wallpaper that could be used as a demo trailer if he ever decided to go elevator music. I have been a big fan of Kimock for years, KVHW, etc....this one in a word SUCKS!"
3,No taste that I can discern,"This stock arrived quickly and in good condition. The vendor managed the transaction well.I am sorry to say that this mushroom stock didn't taste like anything, I cannot discern any taste. Other flavors of this brand that I have gotten had some taste as well as a lot of salt. Their low sodium versions were also salty to my taste.Well, I will continue to buy and use this brand because despite my criticism, it is indeed better than bouillon!"
1,BORING,"I bought this book on the strength of the reviews here. However, it was soo boring I forgot about it as soon as I was finished skimming...I mean reading it. The two leads had almost no chemistry. It just seemed like the author needed an excise to write a book so she made some characters up and put them together. The premise seemed promising but the plot was weak and went nowhere. It's my first and last time reading this author."
4,Another fun read,I'm trying to read as many Susan Mallery books as I can find the her stories about the Sheik's have very enjoyable. This was a fun and easy read. Haven't found one of her books I wouldn't recommend.
3,Overpriced for meager information,"This book is [price] and I cannot see the justification for it. 90% of the informatin of this book is contained in Rob Vierra's SQL 2000 book. If you already own Rob Vierra's book, you probably don't need this book to teach you the fundamentals of SQL.This book does a great job for teaching you the fundamentals of SQL. But I am not sure if THAT is worth [price] since SQL is a relatively easy language to learn. Almost every Database book I won teach the concepts of this book. I expected MUCH more and show some cutting edge SQL scripting for its price. But this book fails to deliver it."
5,A Classic.,This movie captures the enthusiasm and imagination of the people involved in the growth of the personal computer. A must-have for any geek!
3,not one of my favorites,"Storyline moves a little slow for me - The Net was done better I thought with Sandra Bullock, oh well."
5,Just makes you want to run & buy a 28.8 kbps modem,"This is truely a great story about hacking if not a little over the top. But when this movie was made you needed graphics to sell a movie(still do note: Shordfish), I mean who would pay money to watch some guy typeing on a black and white screen? The music in my opinion is truly what sells this movie and gets you right into the action. The story line is well done and the acting is good. I'd buy it but I'm afraid someone will hack my computer. No, really I've seen this movie many times and it gets better every time. Who would not want the kind of control these kids have being......HACKERS."
3,"off technically, but otherwise good","While hackers offers little to anyone who is looking for technical accuracy (TRON was even more realistic), it is a very entertaining film. While Jonny Lee Miller's performance in Trainspotting was beyond brilliant, his character in Hackers seemed 2-dimentional. The rest of the cast, however, more than makes up for his shortcomings."
5,My training started here,"This movie was instrumental in my becoming a programmer and dare i say ""hacker"". Recommend highly"
4,Tripple F: Fun Flight of Fancy,"This movie, as with most main stream films, is a flight of fancy. if you have ever watched star wars or star trek use the same rulez to watch this moive: Suspend all reality. sure its campy, sure its corny, sure its got Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, and of course the GREAT mathew lillard, but it is SO wrong in SO many aspects! But it is a main stream hollywood teen flick about fighting they system, yes i know thats an oxy moron, much like wearing gap to be diffrent, but hey what ever. its fun to watch but don't expect to learn to hack or phreak from it. or see any semblece of reality, but hey i like star wars also and if you did you just might be able to suspend you disbelif and watch and enjoy this flim."
3,eh,"This movie had an ok story, but it was a bit too unrealsistic for my taste. First of all, there arent any huge mainframes that have all these flashy lights and sparkly equipment- maybe in the 60's. Also, it takes them about 2 seconds to download this gigantic, destructive, monstrosity of a virus onto a floppy disk with a 28k modem. But I guess the movie would be about 5 times longer if it was real time, not to mention the fact that the cops would have to run for practicaly 3 hours in order to get there just after copying this virus to a disk. But overall, it was an ok flick."
3,Unrealistic,"Is a pretty good movie, they took many real life hacking terms, but it look unrealistic. If anyone that have no idea about hacking would make them think this movie is so kewl since how they got it to gibson and all.. Why they put Cerealkiller Emmanuel Goldstein? He is the Editor - In - Chief of 2600. Anyway is a kewl movie."
5,"Angelina,Angelina,Angelina!","OH my god! I swear to goodness this is a great film... I love Angelina Jolie films (thats why I watched this movie) But little did I know this film had a great cast(MAthew lillard, and Jesse Bradford) I LOOVe Jesse. He's a hottie!So is his booty! But anyway Angelina is the best actress and the most beautiful human being on the face of this earth.(check her out in ""Playing by heart"") That film has the hottest man alive in it(Ryan Phillipe) Everyone go out and have an Angelina Jolie marathon. REnt.. Buy...Borrow. Whatevers clever...You won't regret it! SUPPORT THE WORLDS MOST TALENTED ACTRESS!"
3,It's OK.,"Technically this movies has MAJOR flaws. It is kind of interesting how they try to drop Cyberpunk and Hacker references into the movie. (I was supprised to see the ""Devil Book"" that I own, though I was never aware it was called that. Wouldn't it really be called the Daemon book?) I like the sound track and the visual effects. I think the kids presented in the movie are not anything like real Hackers, but I know there are legions of kids who are at this moment trying to emulate those Characters. ( How non-conformist .... in a conformist sort of way. -Lisa Simpson). I use it as background noise sometimes."
1,WASTAGE!,If you know anything about computers/software this film willmake you ill. NOTHING is accurate. The obviously contrived dialogscripted from a list of buzzwords doesn't make it. This film makesthe case for not allowing producers/directors with money to smokepot and do coke. What a waste of money and time. It gets one starfor an attractive very early A. Jolie.
1,Bad - bad - title,"Maybe the worst snobbish remake you could do on Wargames, Hackers isn't just unnacurate; it's the reason why you'll find all this new generation of kids that arrive at the Internet with the only desire of ""beeing l33t"".Worst favor that could be given to the underground/cyberpunk/hacker/whatever communities, showing just stupid kids who wanna be elite... at least with just a bit on computer knowledge the movie is laughable"
3,"So called ""hackers""","well this movie infact quite unrealistic, has a fairly good plot, however ""unlife like"", working in computers i find it quite amusing, that even quotes from the hackers manifesto is there, this movie displays characteristics of crackers more so than hackers, which i am sure has been mentioned. (and hense the 31337 manifesto) i still would recomend it, just because its good for a quick laugh on others preception of ""hackers"""
1,Worst movie ever,I dont know where to start with this one there is nothing redeamable about this movie I didnt care for any of the charecters and the acting was really bad.Where was the plot on this?
1,A poor piece of work,"As a computer professional, I found this movie both pointless and technically flawed. As a previous reviewer has stated, this movie is indeed not ABOUT Hackers, but rather, it is a sterotyped look at at ego maniac cyberpunks who haven't a clue how to use a computer or what to do with one. The use of psychadelic colors throughout the movie is sickening, the plot is weak and disjointed, and the movie's title should have been named ""teenage cyber-dropouts from wonderland"". Do yourself a BIG favor and rent either Wargames (Old, but has a good storyline) or Sneakers instead."
3,totally unrealistic but entertaining,"For those looking for an accurate portrayal of hacking and the hacking lifestyle, this is not for you. This movie is fun, that's it. It has more to do with romance and teenage problems than it does hacking. The scenes that have to do with hacking look cool, but really are nothing like the real thing. This however is completely understandable. If they were to show the real thing, the movie would be one of the more boring movies ever to hit the big screen. It's just a good movie to watch and have a good time with."
4,title speaks for itself,"As the title speaks to us, 'Hackers', it becomes aparent to us that the movie might be about hacking, and yes your right. But this is hacking with a twist, hackers against one hacker. 'Hackers of the world unite' to form an alience to defeat the one controlling their lives.It starts as a revenge story between two hackers that met in an interesting situation, the plot gathers itself around this fact to form them as boy and girl as you would. The revenge story becomes a fight for hte fitest, and see how it turned out."
4,A Load of Bull,"This movie was a great thing for entertainment but...It was not very accurate.This movie gave the empression that all Hackers do is sit and throw commands at a computer. But acctually Hackers go into alot of ""Off-Computer"" work to get into a system. But all in all it is a great movie when entertainment is wat you are looking for."
3,"Totally schizophrenic - 1/2 good film, 1/2 horrendous trash","The hacker's story and their relationships is interesting. However,the larger plot about a company security expert pinning the blame on the hackers as part of a scheme is just awful. And Lorraine Bracco as his girlfriend was an embarassment. So... if you can sort of ignore that part of the movie, it's a terrific piece of work with amazing use of the camera to visualize the hacking sequences.When I first saw it, I thought Johnny Lee Miller ruined the film as the lead. Now, I really sort of like his work there."
1,Terrible - 1995 junker - do not waste your time,"Dec 2010 - I watched half of it. Juvenile and technically in the dinosaur age - spacing out at 28.8K modems? and laptops with color screens? Do not waste your time. 15 year old wine can be great, 15 year old technology is not."
1,"Terrible, really bad.","I am a hacker, and ive never been to a bar like that!This movie is bad, not because of the cheezy plot, not because of the bad acting, but because there are little kids who watch this movie and go on aol (heh,if you didnt know, aol is NOT the hackers choice) and proclaim : 'i am a masta haxx0r d00dz'.Yeah, to be a 31337 hacker you gotta jump on a payphone and shout 'I AM DADE MURPHY, HACK THE PLANET'. Please people, if you see this movie, please dont try to become a hacker. If you actually payed $96 for this rubbish, you really arent smart enough to be a hacker, sorry."

5,Awesome Movie,"this movie is absolutly great, it's a great story, a lot of people complain about it, because it doesn't depict true hacker culture, well people, ya gotta remember two things: 1.) this movie is meant to be a visual manifestation of what hackers see the computer world is, and 2.) if they really showed what true hackers saw on their screen (mostly text, no graphics) then people would get boring, and not want to watch it, and the people that review this movie are always saying, "" i'm a hacker, and i never goto clubs like that"", tends to tip off the fact that the person really isn't a a hacker, and should use their imagination, and really get the creativity that went into this movie, this is a top of the line movie, awesome music, good acting, and nice visuals, 5 stars all the way!"
5,A must see for those interested in Hacker culture,"I rented this movie recently for the first time. It was spectacular. Although it doesn't give a completely accurate description of hacker culture, it comes close. This movies show's hackers to be what they really are: People looking for free information, not working to destroy things. The methods of hacking and phreaking (making free phone calls) are innaccurate enough so kids can't do it, but accurate enough to show it can be done and will inspire people to learn more about computers. This is the future"
4,Great Movie,"I love this movie. I know it exagerates the Hacker culture a little too far, but that doesn't take away from the great story that it is. This is definately one of the best 'computer' or 'tech' movies around. A must have for anyone who is into computers. Hackers may find it to be a complete comedy.The only bad thing I can say about this movie (ie: 4/5) is that the video quality, although acceptable, is not up to DVD standards, IMO. The letterbox in which the movie actually is looks okay, but about 15% of the screen hight is wasted in a gre/black band above and below the letterbox. Then there's the regular wasted 20$ of the screen because its 16:9, but that's fine cause that's what I wanted.Enjoy. Its a great film that I had watched at least 15 times since its VHS release, and probably about 6 times after purcashing the DVD."
4,"Just remember this is science fiction, and you'll be fine","At fist, like many other reviewers, I found myself appalled at so many inaccuracies in this movie. Then, about halfway through, I told myself to think of this just like any other science fiction book, and that made a world of difference.This movie is not a documentary, nor does it try to play itself off as one. As a matter of fact, the gross inaccuracy of many references is used to cue the viewer in that it is a work of fiction. Unfortunately, too many people probably missed this, which is why it has been relegated to a b-grade movie that gets little attention.The acting is very good (I wouldn't say great, but definite above average) and the story (take with the above described grain of salt) is fun and humorous."
5,This is definitely hacking!,"Real hackers beware this movie is nothing like the real thing! This is a fun movie that just gives you a reason to bring up bad references from it. It's a fun take on the ""idea"" of hacking with you flying around the insides of servers and partying at night clubs.Don't expect to learn anything but expect to laugh!"
5,Amazing!,"I've loved Hackers since the first time I saw it in the movie theatres, and it has won the award as being my favourite movie of all time. The actors (Matthew Lillard, a.k.a. Cereal Killer is my favourite!)are amazing and create a chemistry that keeps the viewers on the edge of their seats. The music is upbeat and can only enhance the fast pace of the plot. It has plenty of amusing scenes to balance out the action ones. All I can tell you is that you have to see it to belive how amazing this movie is!"
2,is it really ...,"Acting is nice and that is why I gave it two stars. Other than that, I guess things could be a bit more realistic. If you are new to Computers or not familiar with them at all - watch it, you will like it, however if you are computer literate or worse professional, - DO NOT BOTHER - it will make no sense to you."
3,This movie gets a 5.3 on the suck scale!,"I think I would have enjoyed the movie much more if I weren't a hacker myself. The taking over the TV station scene and the harassing the FBI guy scenes were hilarious but the rest of the movie completely disgusted me. I have to admit I watched it twice, though. Big mistake and it'll never happen again."
5,It changed my life!!,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen! The acting isn't oscar worthy and the technology is a tad bit exaggerated. But for my 60$, (I saw it 10 times in the theater), it's worth it. Angelina Jolie is a goddess! I will never look the same at a short-haired woman again!"
4,It Rocks My World.,"Hey, Sure, on the technical end it leaves a lot to be desired, but the characters dress so cool you gotta love them for it. Since only Johnny lee Miller can pull off a life jacket and still look normal, or Angeline Jolie who wears a pant suit and can still look cool this movie is da bomb. It's great on entertainment value, because the dialogue is really well written and executed. Also a good movie to catch if you are a Matthew Lilliard fan (he's the dude from scream). It's a movie you could watch a million times and never get tired of, because you understand everything a little more everytime you watch it."
1,This movie sucks!,"I'm a 'hacker' -- I've played with more than my share of systems and even run a website on the subject.I have to say that this movie not only sucks arts-wise, but it totally fails to portray the hacker culture and the underlying technology. The three-dimensional models SUCK and the rave scene is ridiculous.I found myself laughing through the whole movie... except when I was throwing up.What a crock -- just shows you what a sellout 2600 is."
4,"people people hackers, hands-down","hackers, its a movie about........ hacking..... computer hackingits great for its time then and now, since computer hackers do have access codes to the internet, but anyways.the actors fit the parts well and such and such,the special effects might be under scale but it was great scenes for its time. go see the movie if your interested in things like that.typed by her daughter colette <----------- x]"
2,yawn,"I've seen a lot of movies that were absolute rubbish but, in the genre computer hacking, this one made an effort to be glossy, expensive, perfect world looking designer rubbish. The acting was terrible, the believability level was very low. There wasn't much of a plot to keep me interested and all the characters seem so sterotypical. This movie is only good for background wallpaper in industrial-style nightclubs"
1,Ouch,The thought that in real life the blond dude was shagging ms jolie is and he let her go is funny.What is even more funny is all the people who actually like this movie.Even the to leads in this said the only reason they did this was they needed work
1,"A horrible, horrible, horrible movie","I want my hour and a half back. Nothing about this movie was good. It wasn't thrilling, it wasn't sexy, it wasn't funny. It, however, was full of bad acting, bad plot lines, and lame ideas. Don't waste your time. And by the way. Angelina Jolie- NOT hot with the short hair."
5,Early Angelina,This is a period piece in computer-geek cinema. It is a classic story. It is a must-have for any Angelina Jolie collection though it is pretty tame compared to her later work.
5,hackers!,great movie. true classic. loved the music and the story lines. if you enjoy this movie you will also like the pest
4,"Luv It, Wish I were In It","It depends on your taste for movies if you like this or not. I love Mrs. Jolie and (basically) everthing that she's done, but I love this movie because the teenagers are like those in real life. I could easliy see me or a friend in these people's places. Those looking for hacking tips will find none."
4,spandex a privilege not a right!!!!!!!!,"Jonny Lee Miller and Angelina Jolie are great actors in this flick and so are the rest of the cast. I give this movie 4 stars because it's origanal,and different from most movies. The movie is about a bunch of teens who get messed up when they hack into the gibson and end up in a hole lot of trouble. They become framed with a virus they didn't plant and must try to prove their innocence find out who did it and only in 2 days."
3,A Good Movie if you can ignore the problems with it,"The movie it self is not that bad, fun to watch, but come on how many corp computers have a 3D system that runs like the whole world has a super super super computer. Last time I checked most corps used unix, linux, and some Windows NT. And the computers the kids used to hack the Corp computer could have never put out those kind of graphics, one kid used a 486 or lower, and looked at graphics a P3 might even have trouble with. So bottom line, if you are a hacker then watch and try to rember its fake, if you are a everyday person then watch the movie and say ""hay cool, I wanna hack!"""
4,Just 31337,"I loved this movie so damn much that it's not funny. I mean, okay, there were _some_ flaws in it, but then again it showed that humans, when working in groups, can acheive their desires easier. It shows to me that they were like ants, working together without bias, workig for the common safety of the team. I loved the inclusion of the _Mentor's Last Words_. I have that speech above my ""'puter"" to look at whenever I need ""inspiration""."
4,"""Hack the planet"" one famous line from the movie...","This movie is great it goes right along with it's latter day likes inlcluding war games. Hackers stars Angelina Jolie in one of her first main roles (b.t.w. she is such a spitfire in this movie) including Jonny lee Miller who was also in Aeon Flux and Trainspotting.If your into the birth of the technological era, hacking,cool old school movies or angelina jolie this is the perfect thing for you!"
4,"We are Samurai, The Keyboard Cowboys...","Jonny Lee Miller (Trainspotting) and Angelina Jolie team up, with the perfect blend of cohorts and their various ""talents"" which are guaranteed to place a smile on any viewer's face, whether cyber-techies or otherwise, a trait which director Ian Softley presents skillfully. Hackers is certainly a fun movie to watch anytime, with a working conglomeration of action, comedy, true friendship, and a nice take on the game of romance in the '90's. This film certainly doesn't disappoint. Hack the Plantet! END"
5,best movie about hackers,"U should see this movie to understand who's the hell hackers is, they manifesto, they work, they dreams. Great actors, cool soundtracks. Must have item!"
3,"dont have to be a nerd to understand, just computer literate","This is a pretty good movie, especially when you look back and see how excited the actors get talking about how fast their new computer is compared to todays standards. You do need to know a little bit of computer lingo to under stand what they are saying but the plot is really easy to understand."
2,Hackers!???,"To tell the truth, this is a funny comedy of what hacking is, mean, the one who wrote that this is a good example of what ""happens"" out there, must be afraid of a microwaveoven or a VCR. If you wanna laugh for 1 hours and minutes, try this movie, you'll find yourself inmmerse in somekinda 13 year old kid's wet dream, but, pl3@z3!! do not relate this movie with real hacking because, IT IS NOT what really is.!"
4,Hack The Planet!,"I've always loved this movie. For years and years. Before most of the main characters went on to much bigger succees. (I.E. Johnny Lee Miller in ""Transpotting"" Angelina Jolie in ""Gia"" and ""Girl, Interrupted"" and (I'm a loss for words on his name ""Ceral Killer"", in ""Scream"") Even a surprise apperance by Fisher Stevens makes this movie a real ride.I'm sure that ""real"" hackers of the word most consider this movie a fruit loop look into ""THEIR"" world but, for the rest of us our there, it's a fast paced, exciting, sometimes steamy, story that keeps you guessing and WATCHING for a longtime.It's a great movie worth your time."
4,Amusing little tale...,"... but, as others have mentioned, not all that life-like. Not many of us would draw that much attention to ourselves by hanging out in a largish group IRL.Another thing, the imagery is interesting; back in my day, it was ALL character based interfaces, so we ""saw"" the network differently.There a number of memorable scenes during the 'competition', but I won't spoil anything for ya. :)I think this must be on of Angiline Jolie's first films; keep an eye out for some 'intersting' scenes with her. Penn Gillete is kinda funny, too.Well worth a watch, or two. Kinda took me back to my youth... ;)"
5,My favorite movie,I don't know why but ever since I saw this movie back in the 90s I've always loved it. It has many references to real things behind the computer community and many others that are just pure fantasy. You also get to see some good actors at the beginning of their careers. You don't have to be a geek to like the movie but if you are you will get the hang of it better.
4,Not True but makes you want it,"So this movie isn't true, but it is a close representation of what life of a hacker is, always looking behind your back, always thirsting for information. This movie is great, and has early casting of some great people, this movie need to be respected, good plot, bad info, old slang, but yet it still has a great jewl, that makes you want more. ""I am 15 but I should not be questioned because of my age but because of my thoughts."""
4,Great Movie :),"I just saw this movie a few days ago, and although it is outdated compared to what our technology is now, the movie was fun and exciting. Jonny Lee Miller (what a cutie) and Angelina Jolie are great together. Matt Lillard is crazy as usual. See the movie, its pretty awesome and keeps ya interested :)"
5,"There Is No Right And Wrong, Only Fun And Boring","This movie may not show what real hackers go through, but it sure is good. I have loved this movie ever since I first saw Crash and Burn fighting over the TV station."
3,Apple ftl,"I have a love hate relationship with this film. I could sit and watch Jolie in this all day long. However I find myself rolling my eyes every time they deal with cracking or just computers, and I want to throw something at my TV every time I see that Apple logo. Apple? Please. If it weren't for that product placement I might have rated it higher. The writers obviously didn't know the lingo. For all those bringing up the obsolete tech, some of us remember drooling over a 28.8 modem. I remember my first modem which was a 300b cradle. I did smile when I watched it recently when Jolie said ""RISC is going to change the world"". I remember thinking that. I can forgive the graphics and the beeps. Commandline is not screen friendly. Apple though...ftl."
4,"Very unrealistic, but also very fun.","This movie is grossly incorrect in the majority of technical aspects that are covered in it (such as the the GUI for the Gibson computer, or the simplicity of all the hacking that goes on.)However, with decent acting and a generally fun and engaging plot the movie pulls off an entertaining, if not true to life, scenario.The movie begins well, and ends strongly as well. All the characters (Lord Nikon, ZeroCool, Acid Burn, Phantom Phreak, Cereal Killer, and The Plague, as well as Joey who has no handle) are all well acted, and work well together.If you're looking for a peek into the lives of real hackers, or the hacker culture, or even realstic technical details, this is definitely not the movie for you. However, if you're looking for a cyberpunk film for some action and light-hearted entertainment this is it.Also, if you're a fan of pop, techno, and trip-hop check out the soundtracks. All 3 (that's right, 3) are very good."
2,"Fake, but Fun","This movie is ridiculously unrealistic. If it were this easy to hack in to most of the things that were hacked in to in this movie, more businesses would be doing some serious upgrading, which, they aren't. So the likely conclusion is that hacking into everything in a few seconds is not possible.However, I did think it was an entertaining movie. It was fun and light. At absolute best, it deserves 2 stars."
1,Hackers is just plain out BAD!!!!,"I saw Hackers a few years ago and thought it was [bad]. But a friend of mine was recently saying how much she liked it, so I thought maybe I should give it another chance. Well I watched it again, this time with an open mind and with the intention of really trying to enjoy it. Unfortunatly, I was right the first time...it's [bad]! The characters are generic, predictable, and cliché. The story is even worse! You don't need to have a knowledge of computers, the internet, or hacking to know that this story is completely unrealistic and insulting to your intelligence. The one good thing that I can say about this movie is that soundtrack is outstanding! Unfortunately, that is about the only thing that is enjoyable (well that and looking at Angelina Jolie wearing a see-thru top)."
5,dis was the best movie ive ever seen,it is the best movie in the world deffenitly get it its really cool and RULES all other hacking moves and computer videos this is the DOPE STUFF GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT GET IT
2,The Net was better (but not by much),"Hackers could have been a great movie. It has a great, complex plot which has been lacking from a lot of movies of late. But there was too much that let it down. This movie had probably the most annoying characters I have ever seen. Joey made me want to throw things at the screen, Cereal Killer made me want to stab my ears, Acid Burn just really irritated me, and I just couldn't 'go' for them. The movie also had way too many unnecessary special effects. If the had just been standard Windows screens, it would have been a lot more believable (and made more sense). The final thing that really bugged me was the terminology they used. Give you a few examples ""It's faster than the Pentium"", ""It has a PCI bus"". Yeah, so? These are supposed to be computer geniuses and they sound like they've just read some jargon that they don't even understand straight from a computer magazine."
5,"Jolie, Hufmann, Bracco!!","Oh! Do I have your attention now!?? Buy this and watch three of the most talented actresses alive and two of the most beautiful (sorry Huffman, but you do frumpy like no ones business). A good look at Jolie tosee her roots. and a puzzle movie where allt he piece's fit!"
3,An intriguing movie for a younger audience,"This movie was put together as a modern day war time movie. Good vs bad, intelligent vs inept, etc. It had the same basic plot as many other movie simply trying to draw younger audiences, as opposed to drawing adults and young adults on a whole. In light, of course, to its obvious attempt to attract older audiences by strangely erotic dreams from two high school teenagers. Lets face it, was it really necessary to paint a computer in army fatigues color in order to do a rightous hack(a phrase used in the movie), or federal offense? All in all I will say it was a good movie, and put together well, but for younger audiences."
2,"Dissapointing, cheesy and amateurish..","Sadly, although the title of the movie says ""Hackers"", this movie is really a classic holywood teenage simplification of a subject and is introducing many misconceptions and false facts about hackers.After the first couple of minutes, which are actually not that bad, most of things go wrong. The acting is on an amateur level and the sessions with computers are very cheesy and don't reflect the reality at all.There are couple of ""clever"" references to the real world (one of characters is named ""Emmanuel Glodstein"" which is a handle of 2600's general editor (the handle is actually taken from the Orwell's 1984) and a reference to the fameous (harmless) ""cookie"" virus) but those are weak and targeted toward uneducated audience.This movie was a really big dissapointment after all these flashy reviews on Amazon.com and other sites. I am still waiting for a decent hacker movie."
4,OH YEAH,"What can I say.... a FUN movie! Angelina Jolie..... PRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! ok, getting serious now... a great depiction of the whole hacker subculture. I especially appreciated the movies multiple allusions to the great William Gibson. In fact, numerous time throughout the movie supercomputers are refered to as Gibsons. Also, I love what they do to the secret service agent. HACK THE PLANET!"
2,"Fun, but BROKEN","I bought this game on a whim; I am not a Spyro fan. For the first few hours, I found it quite enjoyable. It had colorful graphics, cool moves, and even some humorous aspects. Unfortuneately, it is UNBELIEVABLY frustrating. I'm quite skilled with platformers, but this game required perfect timing, accuracy, etc. All this led to a lot of anger on my part. Still, I might have managed to work through it...if it hadn't BROKE! Yes, that's right: when I tried to turn it on again, the XBox refused to read my saved file. And I must admit, I had no desire to start over. Eventually, I sold this game...and my XBox. Sorry, Vivendi; sorry, Bill Gates. You'll both have to come up with something less faulty next time."
3,good,"When package didn't come in time, seller was willing to work with me to fix the issue. Game condition excellent."
5,The conclusion keeps the spirit of the series alive and well,"This fourth and final book in the Videssos Cycle concludes the epic adventures of the Roman Legion with a flourish. Many new characters with their own skills and shortcomings are introduced, adding to the atmosphere of humor that surrounds the whole series. An overweight pen-pusher forced to fight when a diplomatic mission runs into trouble and a band of homosexual armored knights are only a couple of examples.The final battle is a savory medley of might and magic at their finest, as Avshar, the Videssians and the Makurani fight for power and freedom. Meanwhile, our heroes attempt to make the ultimate sacrifice. . .The only thing that upset me about this book is that it is the last in the series. The story was neatly tied off in the end, but it left me wanting more."
2,"If you Like ""Exemplory"" Classic Hip Hop....YOU CANNOT Pass this album By!!!!!!!!!","This album throw's the consept that rap has to be ""repetative"" and ""musicless"" out the door. Peep their website... http://theprocussions.com they have a video, and a live recording in Japan that says it all. These cats definitly speak for themselves. They are Breaking through to new horizions while still maintaining the perfect pulse of ""original"" and ""Pure Classic"" Rap and Hip Hop. They are ""REAL"" STUDENTS OF THE GAME, turning to ""Master"" ""One-Upped"" by students. I will point out that ""Stro"" the anchor rapper of the group, could be a professional drummer... check out his track at the website ""Bee Boy's Alarm Clock"".....What chou waitin for, add to your shopping car and tell your car stereo to get ready for a nice massage...."
3,Loopy fun,"As you listen you sometimes catch yourself asking what are they singing about...but that is half the fun as the goofy lyrics and sometimes goofier music gel into a fun album. From ""My Doorbell"" to ""Forever For Her"" and all songs before and after you can sometimes get a feel for ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" antics. It'll put a smile on your face and be aware of some foot tapping to come..."
4,Different... But Good!,"The White Stripes take a 180 degree turn to produce one of their least focused but strongest albums yet. The minimalist rock duo from Detroit tell a complete story of pain and grief in experiencing the ending of a relationship, which, in this case is about Jack White's relationship with actress Renee Zelwegger (who is referred to as Rita Hayworth throughout the album). The instruments are also bigger and louder, whether the guitars, piano or the drums (one example would be the clever use of the drums on ""The Nurse""). This album packs a punch so it's definitely not one for the faint hearted. Prepare to be thoroughly thrilled!"
5,Thank You Satan,"I have yet to hear a White Stripes Album I do not like, great songwriting all the way through. Cant wait to see them at the Greek. Allthough they brought back stripped down rock of the past it still is a breath of fresh air in the corporate polluted state of the music industry today."
2,God you people annoy me!!,"Listen, the White Stripes are not a bad band. Yeah I used to think ok,their doing some kinda cool ""Detroit stuff"" (still doesnt compare to the Stooges or the MC5 tho), but then they release this. I think its great they are doing what they feel, but what the hell! Way to loose fans. It is a sad statement that Jack White is considered the guitar god of the new century. COME ON!!! Listen to 'Instinct Blues'. He plays like s**t. Squely little licks that sound terrible. We have 2 OK rock bands today : Queens of the Stone Age and the Foo Fighters. Wow. Fountains of Wayne writes good songs too. But ofcoars those bands won't win a grammy. Enjoy listening listening to the ""new pinnacle of rock drumming"" known as Meg 'I can't play my f**king drums' White. GOD!!!! Go ahead disagree with me, I dont care. How depressing."
2,".... yeah, but can you dance to it?","Someone's gonna have to explain this band to me. I've listened to this Cd, the previous one, the Loretta Lynn CD, seen 'em on the TV, and all I hear is something between art school and ugly. Were I Paige or Plant, I'd b-slap the next monkey that compared this duo to L Zeppo (and I HATED Zep). What anybody sees in a guy that can't sing, isn't very good at guitar and a woman who re-set the Karen Carpenter level of drumming LOWER is beyond me. If you really think this where music is going, god help the rest of us. The saving grace here is that they make Sleater Kinney worth listening to. So when does that John Hiatt disc come out?"
1,Horror is putting it lightly.,"This band is a joke. People say this band is awesome and untouchable but they are by far the worst band I have ever heard. Luckily i never baught this crap. Don't buy this cd, buy some slayer or opeth (real bands that can play) instead.-Daniel Damnation\m/666\m/"
2,"Finally Bought instead of burnt, and i want my money back!","Blue Orchid is amazing, so I figured I would buy the CD and repay the band for burning their other 2 records. I sampled the CD today and I'm so disappointed that im selling it back to used CD store tomorrow. It is not worth buying at all, half the songs are good and the other half suck. Just download Blue Orchid, its all you really need."
3,not bad for trendy music,"there are some good songs on this album, some bad ones too, but what do you expect? most albums today from top selling artists have a couple good songs with a lot of ""filler"" included. not to say there is a lot of filler on this album but there is some. do yourself a favor and look a little harder for good music instead of the top 40 sellers at any given time. there are so many better bands to listen to if you try, go to a independent record store and check out bands you've never heard of, for example; new bomb turks, supersuckers, zeke, swingin' neckbreakers, bellrays, black keys, the bronx, death from above 1979, dirtbombs,the paybacks, rock n roll soldiers, skeleton key, supagroup, etc. try some of those and stay away from radio for awile."
1,The self publicising joke returns.,"Old Jackie White has come along away since his career took off amidst pathetic publicity stunts that Michael Jackson or Robbie Williams wouldn't stoop so low to enact. A joke of a performer who relies on cheap stunts in a vain attempt to generate sales of his extremely tedious and one dimensional 'music'.You want Blues rather White Stripes 3rd rate revisionism, then go check Beefheart, Howlin' Wolf, John Mayall...people who had a real feel for the music.It is a sad sad indictment of the current state of music over the recent years that so the so called independent music scene has been brought down to the level of teen boy / girl bands MTV hype by one performer, the white stripes"
2,Bleh...,"Seriously, the only good song on this album is ""Blue Orchid"". You might go off better by downloading it on itunes or somthing. In my opinion, Elephant was way better than Satan. I practically fell asleep listening to this cd! I don't want to believe this myself but it's true. At least Elephant had some good tunes in it."
3,I'm just not sure about them!,It's different and unusual. I just don't know if I like it or not....too much of a mixture of music from Hard Rock to Hillbilly strangeness!
1,Are you serious?,"I read in Rolling Stone how it must really suck to be in a rock band right now if you're not in The White Stripes. Wow. It also received a rating of 4 1/2 stars. That's just a 1/2 star away from being a classic. ARE YOU SERIOUS!?!?! Well, then again, that's Rolling Stone and for years now they've been catering to the Teen Magazine crowd. I just can't understand how so many people can get sucked into thinking that this type of ""music"" is ""great"". It's not even relevant. The worst joke on here is track #9 Passive Manipulation. People are actually shelling out real money for this crap. Again, wow. It supposedly took Jack White only two weeks to record this album. I really really believe it."
3,It's just OK,"I bought this cd without hearing anything about it, except seeing the new video on tv. I played it in my car a couple of times and it seemed interesting, but when I listened to it in my headphones, it was just...ok. I really enjoy the first half of the cd, but the second half kinda drags for me. It's a little repetitious too. At times it reminds me of the Beatles White Album, which just makes my stomach turn. But if I don't think about that, then it's alright. :o)"
2,Get Behind Me Satan,"The way I see it is that every band puts out a crappy album. I had high expectations from this album. What is sounds like is someone secretly recorded them making songs for fun. It sounds like it was rushed and like they didn't care what they put on there. I'm a big fan of their old music. If that's what you're into, you won't like this. I'm not going to put down every song. Blue Orchid is a good song. If they went for more of that sound, I would be happy. As Ugly As I Seem isn't that bad either. I'm not going to put down all the songs. They might grow on me. I might even like the whole album. It just didn't grab me the first time I heard it. Maybe on their next album they will go back to the way they were."
2,I thought the last ones were bad,"All I can say is that the radio is a horribl horrible thing. Blue Orchid would come on and I'd turn it up because I thought above allm the music is interesting, change of pace, you know be open to new ideas. This is just unfogiveable. What is the deal with it, every clash of the drums and horrible reverb effect makes my ears bleed and myeyes burst of built up frustration.If you liked the old albums, don't get this."
2,What a letdown...,"An extremely disappointing release, considering the great accomplishment of ""Elephant"". Of course Jack and Meg don't give a rat's behind---they're laughing all the way to the bank.But they should be ashamed of this one.Come on Stripes---you are capable of so much more.Let's put this dog behind us."
2,meh,Low production quality without anything I'd call startlingly insightful lyrics. Overall I found it useful only to stay in touch with what's 'in'.
2,I'm not feeling it.,"When a band has an album that does so well, it has to be difficult to write another amazing piece of work. I didn't like this album at all. I appreciate the artist's desire to grow/evolve their sound so to stray away from cookie-cutter tracks but....The mix is aweful. The songs lack that certain something that have trademarked The Whtie Spripes from the beginning.I gave this album a 2 because the insert, or lyric book, has an interesting/fresh style. Too bad I can't say the same for the songs."
2,i could play the drums too if i were in the white stripes!,"There is something about mrs. white that is driving me nuts. she cannot play the drums. I saw them live last night and it was painful hearing her play her ""thump, snare"" over and over and over and over again in every song. there was no originality in any of their songs really, add a guitar lick, some incoherent rambling and boom.just watch the music video for seven nation army, and pay attention to the drums. anyone could replace her and noone would know the difference.thump, snare, thump, snare, thump, snare.Though I have to give it to them, they've got some catchy tunes."
5,The Satanic Verses,"Just when ya think ya know what to expect(to a certain degree) from the Stripes, they toss a vintage Zito-like curve at ya.If you're expecting a guitar assault a la ""Ball and Biscuit"" or any numberof other songs, it may take ya a while to adjust to this beast. Thinkpiano and marimba and under-production and you'll have some ideawhere this thing is heading. It's almost like they said ""Hey, we madetwo monster albums. Let's see how they like this!"" Anyway, I can hearthe bitching from here from the people who just wanted to hear ""Eight NationArmy."" Well, surprise, surprise, surprise! Oh, and did I mention that it'sbetter than 97% of everything else out there right now?"
1,sounds like Led Zep + the Stones,"unoriginal. Totally blatant Led Zeppelin ripoffs. everyone these days is too lazy to be original, so they steal from the past, knowing their young consumers don't know the original sources. there's no excuse for such unoriginality. After so much Zep robbing, their next album may as well be 80's metal, since the next progression from Zep's 70's Hard Rock was 80's metal, so they may as well complete the circle they are in. rock is dead. from the 90's to today all rock has been retreads of the past. just let it die. then maybe it can be reborn truly refreshed years thereafter. having years go by with no rock groups sounds good about now."
1,Highly Overrated,Another case of a crappy litte coffee shop band getting an undeserved break while real talent in Detroit goes unnoticed. If I wanted to listen to two people experiment with sound at least I'd listen to Death From Above 1979. At least their vocal style isn't whiney and annoying.
3,Not as good (forgive me for i have sinned),"I wanted this to be the greatest album ever created, which is perhaps setting my expectations a mite too high, but I have to agree with Kelsey. I like this album, but mostly because it has similarities to their four previous ones. If they are trying to 'lose' casual fans, I think that it is as bad as the snobbery of the music magazines, and really, why the marimba?"
2,much better than their last album,"They have come a long way since their hit ""Is This Love"" with the video where Linda Blair does cartwheels on the carhood. I am holding my breath they will do a duet with George Strait."
1,B O R I N G !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"like other two man bands before them ( flat duo-jets,bantaam rooster,bassholes etc.etc.etc.etc.etc.etc. that's right kids the novelty of a band with just guitar and drums is nothing new.) their music is good for about 1 1/2 songs then it's time to move on to somthing with a rythym section. ( i recommend a Booker T and the MGs platter to clean the ears and make you smile once more!!!) this is like this band's 50th record and it is as stale and boring as the first. look thee other way and get on with your life if you are thinking of purchasing this turd or anything by this group. ffffffffiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrfffffffffff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!sniff.....sniffff"
4,Fantastic album,This is a great cd through and through. No two songs sound alike on it as they go through a wide-range of styles. You'll want to put it on repeat.
4,A complete change of direction,"Before this album,The White Stripes were known as a stripped down blues-rock combo. With this 2005 release, all that changed. Rather than guitar and drums being the main instruments, this album makes liberal use of piano and marimba. I'll admit, it is a drastic change, but the results are by no means disappointing.The extra texture and use of a wider range of instruments makes 'Get behind Me Satan' an interesting listen. Even though this album is definitely experimental in places, the majority of songs are quite catchy. I had no idea Jack White had such a talent for playing piano! Some of the piano-based songs have an almost Motown edge, which is quite a pleasant surprise.Unfortunately, a few of the songs are throw-aways and I don't think this effort is as musically focused or cohesive as some of the other White Stripes albums (like 'Elephant'), but that's not a huge problem. It's still a very entertaining and surprising album."
4,Radiating from the Center,"I love this band's music and this album is no exception. Each album always has a prevailing theme throughout almost every song, even if they vary greatly individually. I agree with People magazine that the album is great as an album- not just as a collection of individual songs. It's like Jack's created an epic rather than a stack of individual poems, a play rather than a series of disconnected short acts.Anyway, I think it's good!"
1,A Huge Disappointment....,"I bought the album today after I read Rolling Stone's rave review. I also admire their music. After nearly listening to the entire album, I shut it off. I was very disappointed in their latest effort. It sounds more of an experimental album than the tunes that made them huge. Hasn't Jack White ever heard the saying ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""? A very huge disappointment from a promising rock band. Definitely not worth your hard earned money."
1,Pure Crap,"The White Stripes have been just barely brushing by with their crap for quite some time now. I am getting tired of all the talk about ""artistic development"". That is pure crap. Their drummer might be good if she got the sticks out of her ass.The srtipes suck. End of review."
1,Get Behind us....PLEASE,"Yet another atrocity by the Brown Stripes. The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was making people think the White Stripes where good. The lyrics on this record are repetitive, pointless and stupid. Sounds like Jack got a new how to play guitar book to rip all his songs out of. I feel dumber after hearing this CD. After buying this you will want want to ring the record companies bell and give them there CD back."
2,I Must Not Get It,"Disjointed, stream of consciousness mish-mash. Reminds me of bad pop art. Nothing cohesive or focused. Jolting & jarring. Only songs I enjoyed were Blue Orchid, Forever for Her and Denial Twist. My Doorbell-WTF-comeon. Instinct Blues-Just.No. Passive Manipulation-why??? White Moon-fingernails on a chalkboard. The rest-extreme indifference or active dislike.Yes-some music snobs and critics will fall all over themselves praising this. FWIW-I'm a big White Stripes fan and just because I am a fan doesn't mean I have to give a tonguebath to every one of their efforts. So chalk it up to my plebian taste but I give one star for the experimentation and the other star for Blue Orchid, Forever for Her and Denial Twist."
5,"Funny, sassy and cool","Again my twin girls aged 6 fell totally for The White Stripes. They haden't even seen the video from My Doorbell yet, but after they saw thar they are in love. They looked at the cover and said ""She looks beuatifull, but he looks wierd..."" I trust their jugdement and give this one a five."
2,I Guess I Just Don't Get The Artistic Stuff,"To be honest, I didn't even know that this had been released until the day I bought it. Me being a more than average White Stripes fan, I was very excited and worried at the same time. Excited obviously because it's a new White Stripes album, but I was worried because I knew it would be extremely hard to top Elephant (One of the best albums EVER, I put it up with Dark Side Of The Moon and AEnima). Alas, my worries came true. Though I totally respect an artist's right to do what they want, that doesn't mean that I have to like it. Though not everything on the CD was bad, most of it just seemed to lack the harmonized chaos of Elephant. It is just straight chaos. The few bright spots for me were ""Take, Take, Take"" and ""I'm Lonley (But I Ain't That Lonley Yet)"". I really don't want to take anything away from this great band, but if you don't have any White Stripes CD's and you plan on purchasing one, go with Elephant. You'll be alot happier if you do."
3,Call me old fashioned but...,This album/band would sound so much better with a bass guitar!I can almost hear Blue Orchid now with a thumpin' bass following that chucky guitar riff.
5,the white stripes most innovative and all-around best album to date,"if you thought ""the white stripes"" or ""elephant"" were good, then you will get blown away by ""satan."" the white stripes have reinvented their sound once again. jack white is a true musical GENIUS in every sense of those two words. gone from ""elephant"" are the amazing guitar riffs and are replaced with the piano and the wild drum setups that meg has. i was very saddened when i heard that those amazing guitar riffs were gone from the album because i extremely love hearing the guitar played at its best, but when i bought the album, i was overwhelmed with how good it is. i am a huge fan of the white stripes and jack white and i cant wait til the reinvent their sound on their next album. a definite definite buy."
2,Huh?,"Am i missing something? Since when did the stripes take a complete 360 degree turn in the sound of their music? I mean i was very pleased with the raw garage punk sound of white blood cells and even the poppier rock sound of elephant, but this just isnt what i enjoy listening to. If you liked the single ""Blue Orchid"" enough to buy the album, think again. The album is COMPLETELY different sounding then that one song. If you liked Blue Orchid that much, consider buying elephant becuase thats more what it sounds like. I highly reccomend listening to this album well before buying it, just to make sure you know what your getting into and dont make the same mistake as me. If you like it, cool, but if your like me and dont like this new blue grass, loosely recorded sound, then keep your copy of white blood cells happily and hope for that sound to return to the white stripes someday."
3,The Last Four Were Better!,"This album is ok. It's not bad, but there is something lacking. The last four albums were better than Get Behind Me Satan. The other albums are known for their impact of blues/garage rock revival. This album has only little of that. Maybe, because I only listened to it a couple of times, I'm not used to it-but the other four albums had better written songs. Most of the songs on this albums are just pure fillers.If the Stripes do release a 6th studio album, I hope it is better than this album!"
3,Missing something,"I think that something is organization. Sure a few songs are catchy and enjoyable, but some are just irrelevent to the whole album.Believe me, I like weird and spontaneity but I don't think this is it. I guess because I liked Elephant that I would like this. I'm not quite sure about it yet. Maybe it grows on you.As said in the other review, I payed $9 and got a free cd, the blue orchid single which has 4 songs on it. (Blue orchid is great)I suggest trying to listen to it before you buy it, it's not for everyone."
3,Yeah...,"This album has its pros and its consThe Pros-Experimentation, they are trying to keep fresh-Songs like ""Blue Orchid,"" and ""The Denial Twist,"" rockThe Cons-DULL!!! It lacks the emotion and power I associate with the Stripes-Not enough guitar...or cowbell while we're on the subject.Anyway, this album is ok, it earns its 3, I wouldn't pay full price for it...that's why I own a burnt copy..hehe"
3,Strange Album Indeed,"This is a strange album!I'm a big White Stripes fan and I think that Get Behind Me Satan is a great album after all, even though I have rated it with only 3 stars.There's no doubt that on this album The Stripes are out of inspiration!This is obviously a copy of the first 2 albums.The only original songs that are making this album special are Blue Orchid,The Nurse(wich is a masterpiece),Red Rain,Passive Manipulation,My Doorbell.The Stripes started copying themselves at some song passages even on Elephant but that wasn't so anoying as it is on the last album.This is more like an good EP with old and new songs,but I cannot call it a great full-lenght album.They are not making an Elephant2 like i saw in other review but they aresure making a De Stijl 2 ."
1,They've lost it,"This album just keeps getting worse and worse with each passing song. I was a huge fan until this album. Now my image of the band is ruined. The single is definitely not indicative of the rest of the songs, so don't be fooled. I couldn't even listen to the whole thing I was so bored and disgusted. Don't buy this album and don't pay attention to any of these rave reviews. Listen to their old albums and be happy. I just wish I could get my money back."
1,not going to be a fan anytime soon,"Over the years, I've heard so many good things about this band and yet refrained from buying anything they've done. I heard the song 'Blue Orchid', thought it had a great groove, and decided to give this one a try and see if they could impress and make me a fan. Not gonna happen. That song is the ONLY good song on this disc. Horrible. I guess you have to be a devoted fan to really appreciate this abomination of a recording. If this is your first dabble with this band, DON'T use this disc as your first try. You've been warned..."
1,Jack should practice piano before releasing a new album,"Before this album, Meg could not play drums properly but the ability of Jack at the guitar made the whole stuff to sound cool, roots and bluesy.For this one, Jack has decided to play piano and it appears he can hardly play it, so we are now with a band of 2 non capable music players... Forget it!"
4,My first impression is still my best description...,"When I first played this CD (so far the only CD I own by this group) my first impression was that it totally reminded me of The Beatles White Album. It has that raw, almost unfinished feeling about it. You can sit back and listen to it, and not think ""oh this is a rock group"" or ""this is a blues group"" and just realize that it's a great peice of music. I can't stop listening to it. It's fun, it's sad, it's artsy, it's soulfull... it's everything and it's great. It's music."
5,Buy This NOW!,"Incredible! Thats all i really have to say. The Stripes are my favorite band out there today but even I never thought they could come up with something as brilliant as this! $10 says you wont be able to get ""The Dental Twist"" out of your head after the first listen! HAHA! Congratulations Jack and Meg on another amazing album!"
2,Why can't they simply follow the beat?,"I think the White Stripes is trying to appeal to those wanna-be rockers who never made it out of their basement or their daddy's barn, those raw self-proclaimed musicians for which attitude is everything but the music ... well ... will have think about that one later. I probably can play as bad as the White Stripes do in this album. What happened to the simple ""just follow the beat"" rule? Obviously the rule doesn't apply to the Stripes. And that's why this album is a collection of noise, with some melody behind it. Pretty annoying."
2,Bleah,"I'm from Detroit. I like (like, not worship) the White Stripes. This CD has exactly 2 decent songs, Blue Orchid and The Denial Twist. If you want to hear mastery of this kind of genre the Stripes aspire to, get one of the best albums of all time, Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti.P.S.: Every time I have had this CD on in the house, visitors have asked me, (...) Every time."
1,I will try to write this review so you fans can understand it...,ho mofo marquar subpar in the jiggy bar go very far eata candibar from the whara jar yar mar kar in the tariwar.
2,What happened to the rock?,"I always liked the White Stripes because they were one of the few bands out there who actually rocked. Now there is this, and this is crappy. I guess if you are into artistic pointless drivel, you'll probably love this album, not me. I couldn't find one song I even liked on this record, I feel like a sucker for spending my hard earned 12.99. Honestly, if you are looking for the next Hand Springs, 7 Nation Army, or anything else that was remotely good about the White Stripes, get anything else by them, this album is not for you. If this is the path the Blacks are going to take, please, just break up now."
1,I spent $13.98 plus shipping,"and all I got was a beer coaster.Seriously, do you really think this bunch of recycled boogie blues is new or good? Is it because Rolling Stone told ya?Buy an old blues CD by Muddy Waters and hear the real deal, not some Hollywood version."
2,"Bad Experimentation, this is coming from a die hard fan of the Stripes","3 Songs fit my liking from this bad, just bad concept album. I love ""My Doorbell"" it's got soul to it, ""The Nurse"" it's wierd but the tempo from quiet and soft with the xylaphones to Meg beatin the drums like a step child really work in a perfectly psychotic way. But the real star on this album and in my opinion one of the best Stripes songs ever is ""Red Rain"", it's an intense, hard-rocking, heavy song. Jack really put the Big Muff Pi to work on that song, it's incredible. I would buy this album just to hear ""Red Rain"". The other songs are misplaced stepchildren from Canada, they just don't fit in. I was really disappointed with this album, but Jack and Meg picked it back up with the next albums. I really dont even understand what people are raving about ""Blue Orchid"" for. It's pretty basic and boring. But that's just my opinion. Thanks for letting me say it. I'd say skip this one and buy every last (other) one."
4,hmmmmmmmm....,Well It is another typical white stripes CD. Either you love it or you hate it. I personally am loving this new one. Although not all the songs are superly great there are a few that are well done. It is someout sad that the best song on the cd has been already put out as a single. OVerall if you liked there other cds i would buy this one too!!
2,2 1/2...To technical for the Stripes,"I really like the White Stipes raw sound of 70's rock, and the newest release, ""Get behind me Satan"" really seems to push away from the other releases, which isnt a good thing. There are some good songs on this CD, yet I am not happy with the over-technical pop laden sound of some of the songs. It doesnt seem to fit with their style, and even though I praise them for trying, espcially for being a band of two. This isnt a total dud, but hopefully we wont see the White Stripes completly jump off the their wagon, and onto the pop train."
3,It's OK....,"As a White Stripes fan for a long time, I have to say this album is kind of dissapointing. I'm not saying its terrible, as there are some stand-out tracks that are very good such as ""Blue Orchid"", ""Red Rain"", ""The Nurse"", and ""The Denial Twist"", but it just doesn't rock out like previous albums. They can do whatever they want and play whatever kind of music they want, but if you're like me and prefer their heavier stuff like in their other albums you may not like this CD very much. I'm still giving it three stars because it's still decent, although I hope they go back to their old sound!"
5,Jack Rocks The piano instead of the guitar.,"now lets get this behind us right now Yes only 3 songs have electric guitar on them. but that doesnt mean the white stripes have lost their edge! for instance the songs My Doorbell and The Denial Twist. they have NO guitar in them at all. but they are brilliant. I know people are not going to like this album because it isnt rock. but lets take this into account: THEY MADE THIS ALBUM IN ONLY 2 WEEKS!!! and i just want to say anyone who does not accept and acknowledge that the stripes are expressing their artistic ways on different types of music. if you cant appreciate that then you have no right calling yourself a fan. The fact of the matter is The white stripes are still the white stripes, and they will always have the same type of lyrical creativity on every album including this one. So please give this album a shot. listen to it a couple of times before you go bashing it. thats what i did and now i think this is the best white stripes release to date."
3,"enjoyable, but misses the target","What a great collection of demos! But as a collection of real songs, this CD falls short by White Stripes standards. The piano-driven sound works on a few songs but leaves other songs sounding under-developed, to say the least. The new instrumentation also reveals the weaknesses in WS's songwriting. Simplicity and repetition is their style - this works well with a real loud electric guitar, creating some exciting dynamics. But with a piano, the same repetition flats flat. Good for the WS for trying something new. Maybe they should try something even more radical for them - like spending a little more time in the studio - maybe just an extra week or so........"
5,another hit by the white stripes,"GREAT MUSIC. Jack White is a musical genius on and off the stage and I would recommend buying anything he is involved with. ""Get behind me satan"" continues the bands style while experimenting with new sounds and is fun to listen to. Definitely worth your money."
5,Jack White does it again. . .,"The White Stripes are by far the only thing saving good 'ol Rock and Roll (the crap coming out now is just that: crap) I like the fact that they refuse to use new technology in the making of their music. (electronic sounds, etc) as Jack put it in an interview I read: ""it's a toy that has been over-used"" On par with albums like ""White Blood Cells"" and ""De Stijl,"" ""Get Behind Me Satan"" is a natural progression. (""Elephant"" was kind of a 'get to know the white stripes' album and shed some light on their previous work and opened the door to their new stuff) their lyrics always seem older somehow like they could have been touring with Led Zeppelin or another good old rock and roll band. Here's hoping The White Stripes never lose their formula to create original music!"
4,The White Sripes Let Behind Many Bands!,"The best Stripes yet. Their previous work was overrated; if mixed bags like Elephant can get 5 stars from Rolling Stone, Spoon's Kill the Moonlight deserved 7! Far from a half-assed work, most of GBMS is plain-and-simply brilliant. It's hampered (or helped, depending on one's 'indie' pretensions) by the analog equipment. The songs are so strong, it's a shame that the production muffles them rather than bringing them out in full color. The Stripes are stars now-they need to stop recording like a 70's college band! That GBMS still manages to sieze your ears is a testament to Jack White's passion and talent. Meg's cutesy drumming works fine here, as it always has. The Stripes' music was built for straight-ahead, bass-snare beats. A lot of syncopation would only distract from the real show--Jack's effortless instrumentation and fiery-but-plaintive vocals. And we get to hear Meg's haunting voice again, if only for 34 seconds"
5,there is nothing out there that can compare,I was first turned on to the Stripes about eighteen months ago by my 20 year old son. He had been telling me for months to listen to Elephant. Then I did and soon after I bought all of their recordings and I love each one. I even bought the Cold Mountain cd and I love it too. It is so refreshing and there is nothing like it. It gets into your soul and leaves you with a most pleasurable feeling. I hope they continue to bring their fans what I call the The Bomb.....
4,Welcome Back Jack,"First, let's not forget that ""Elephant"" is one of the greatest records ever made. Not much in the past twenty years stacks up to that record. Jack substitutes much of his Airliner, bluesy guitar with other instrumentation, Piano, other keyboards, acoustic guitar...who cares... This is a fine record from the great Jack White. He gets funky and folky on this one, solid stuff, can't wait for the next one. Jack White saves rock with every record, we all owe him a lot."
4,Trust your instincts on this CD,"Before this CD, I had never really gotten into The White Stripes aside from their more popular tracks like, ""Fell in Love With a Girl"" and ""Seven Nation Army"". I was curious when Get Behind Me Satan came out, though, because I had heard a lot of good things about it. Once I had given it a good listen, I was really pleased. To me, the CD has a great funky, feel-good vibe with their rock edge still mixed in. Once I listened to it more and more, I really loved it. The only songs I can't get into are, ""Little Ghost"", ""White Moon"" and ""Red Rain"". They're okay to me. But overall, a very great effort and definately a CD to have in your collection."
1,"Another fad, they'll be long gone in a year.","I'm willing to bet my life that this is another stupid fad...just like Thursday, Hanson, and about a billion other pointless bands. There's a few catchy hooks, but overall you can find the same riffs with better singing and WAY less annoying frontman (and woman) than this garbage. FAD, I guarantee it."
3,Ehhh...,TO me its just liek thew last 2 white stripes. Nothing to different here. Same sounding stuff. Meg's drumming is just not good at all. Im a drummer and she lacks everythign in a drummer.
1,What The Hell??,1. This is the worst band on the face of the earth!!!2. They should have been born 30 freakin years ago if they wanted to sing music like this!3. U cannot sing and or write songs with only two ppl. It sounds horrible
1,THE MOUSTACHE IS BRILLIANT!!!,"Jack White's moustache on the cover is brilliant!JK, this ablum = wet garbage. The name of the album should be ""Get Behind Me Losers"", refering to the ridculous people who actually listen to their music. Apparently the White Stripes had to ask Satan to back them up because God was busy already backing up Coldplay.COLDPLAY RULES!!!!!"
1,Noooooooooooo,Noooooooooooo.DO NOT BUY THIS !!!!BUY SOMETHING FROM PINK FLOYD INSTEAD. (RECOMMENDATION: PINK FLOYD.- THE DIVISION BELL)PINK FLOYD ROOOOOCKS !!!!!!!!!
3,Mediocre,"While I like the White Stripes, I'm hardly a hardcore fan. This album has about five or six songs I'd consider worth really listening to. The rest are pretty forgettable. My musical interests are all over the board, and I can listen to the whole album and enjoy it, but it's really only those few songs that make me groove along with it. I don't think this is groundbreaking music at all, but I do enjoy Jack White's peculiar charm and his songwriting ability when he's on his game. I think its the more rock oriented songs with a beat that appeal most to me."
4,I like the new Stripes,"I went ahead and bought Get Behind Me Satan even after hearing that it was new direction for the White Stripes and not as good as previous albums. Well, I'd have to disagree-- I think the album is a strong one.Some of the highlights of the album could become classics: My Doorbell, Forever For Her, The Denial Twist, and of course first single Blue Orchid. At times the songs sound rough and unpolished, but a second listen brings out the beauty of this.That being said, not everything is good. I don't like country in my White Stripes, so I hate Little Ghost. Thankfully the less-than-steller songs are few and far between.Overall an interesting album well worth your time and money."
5,Oh my gosh!,"I'm sooooo obssessed with the first 4 songs on this album!I haven't even been able to reach track number 5 here!I'm screaming my lungs out to THE NURSE, MY DOORBELL,FOREVER FOR HER, and even the VMA-nominated BLUE ORCHID. These 4 songs are music orgasms! Each one different from the others...Love 'em dearly...Fantastic!"
4,Unique,"This album really came out of nowhere and suprised me. This is not your usual White Stripes CD. If your an open minded person who likes a lot of styles of music you may like this CD. If your a fan of the White Stripes sound of De Stilj and Elephant then the closest your going to come to that sound on this CD is with Blue Orchid and Instinct Blues. I give this CD 4 stars because its the most unique CD I've bought in a while, but you have to listen to it with an open mind."
1,Where's the REAL album?,"I've listened to this CD several times and it just doesn't hold up--my head is aching from how bad it is. Don't get me wrong...I like when artists take chances and grow and change. For the White Stripes, this is just a slapdash joke. One review I came across compared this set of drivel to the Rolling Stones' ""Exile on Main Street"", but while ""Satan"" is eclectic, it doesn't even come close to Exile. Being eclectic doesn't mean it has to suck.Come on, Jack--where's the REAL album."
3,Not the best White Stripes CD,"I have to say, I'm kinda disappointed in this record, but then, I wasn't expecting a whole lot considering this is going to be the last White Stripes CD, period. A lot of the songs sound like they were written in one draft, so basically, the lyrics I thought were lacking compared to the older albums. I still love the Stripes, but c'mon guys, you could've gone out in a bigger puff than this."
2,what a dissappointment,blue orchid is a great song but the rest of the album sux...the songs are kinda weird.
1,Terrible album!!!,"This album sounds like what Jack White was doing in junior high school. The thing I love about the White Stripes is that they are exciting and fun to listen to. This new album is neither one of those. Jack is a great guitar player and musician but you cannot tell from this mess. The songs all sound like they had no effort put into them; very lame and boring. I know that musicians change their sound and all that, but this is not a good change. I don't want the White Stripes to repeat themselves, but they should not kill themselves. If you want to hear great White Stripes buy any of their other albums, not this one."
3,good,"This album is a change of style from the previous ones. Xilophone and piano, percussions and experimenting with guitar and voice. Just Blue Orchid with its fuzzy distorsion and power chords follow the old course. Most song are very calm and relaxing. A very interesting album. Not for everyone."
2,Pianos?,"I naver accually bought this. I heard it on a CD demo at borders. What The Hell????? I say. I really expected more out of Jack and Meg. Blue Orchid is great(only reason I gave this 2 stars), but after that its just pianos and slow songs. Don't waste yer moolah, and either buy the Blue Orchid single, or Elephant. Thats somthin good."
2,they might wanna rethink that one....,"""Get Behind Me Satan""...The name makes you wonder if Satan was in front of them on their previous 2 albums. If so, he snuck in on first track ""Blue Orchid"" too, then apparently got booted. Being a huge fan of ""Elephant"" and ""White Blood Cells"", I was anticipating another remarkable rock record and what I got was so much honky-tonk, I had to double check if I had actually purchased that Loretta Lynn album Jack helmed last year.Single ""Orchid"" is soo good, it doesnt make you think twice that this album has fallen startopheres below of the normal. After it ends, the album only slightly regains ground all the way down at song 8, ""Instinct Blues"". The piano now being brought full-circle within their band, and very disappointingly so. Bring back the all out guitar/drums sets!!!!!!!"
2,Get Behind Me Satan,"I think I am in the minority here who really don't ""get"" this album. This is definitely a far cry from their past superb efforts.I'm all for groups tinkering with their sound and trying new things, but ""Get Behind Me Satan"" is almost unlistenable at times. The good songs are good riffs are nearly gone on this album.I wonder if perhaps the White Stripes feared that they had become too popular and too mainstream with ""Elephant"", and decided to throw everyone a big curveball with this inaccessible album.I ask you Amazon.com'ers, if ""Get Behind Me Satan"" were the White Stripes' debut cd, would anyone like this band? Would this album be the savior of rock & roll? I think not...Here's hoping the next one is as good as their other efforts!And leave the vibes/marimba to Cal Tjader or Roy Ayers :)"
4,"3.5 or 4, but an A for effort","This is my first white stripes purchase, and I am told had I had elephant, I would hate this album. Regardless, I don't hate it. The songs are indeed simply structured, which I am told is a White Stripes trademark. Some of the songs used very interesting percussion, like a marimba, and stuff that sounded very cool. Not that it hasn't been done before, but cool. Overall, it was au-ight (alright)."
5,Pure Brilliance,"I will admit that my first listen to this album was a complete shock, and I was not sure what to think. But isn't this what real rock music is all about? Must everything be streamlined and accessible from the first listen?It is true that only 3 songs are based on the electric guitar that Jack White is known for, but many of the piano songs are surprisingly upbeat and ""rock"" more than anything that most bands put out nowadays. Yes, there is also bluegrass, folk and old-time piano lounge songs, but these are great songs once the intial shock has faded.I am guessing that most of the negative reviews are from those who have not given the time to absorb the album. I have heard this album compared to Exile on Main Street by some critic. Not because they sound similar (they don't) but because of the wide range of genres. I know it took me several listens to appreciate the brilliance of Exile. Get Behind Me Satan is no different. Possibly the White Stripes best album."
5,once again...,"it has topped elephant... this was the deepest album jack and meg have released so far by a mile...it mixes oldies and blues with their own spin. it is brilliant... the song ""instinct blues"" could be the best song i have heard from the stripes.the stripes put all other modern bands to shame...once again..."
5,An Amazing Feat,"I am in little doubt that this is the best album released in the year 2005. Fans and non fans alike of the White Stripes will love this album; it screams rock and roll with an add on of electronic. Get Behind Me Satan is to The White Stripes as Led Zeppelin III is to Led Zeppelin, more mellow but still rocks.Buy it ASAP."
5,I love it!,"I have now listened to this album all the way through 2 times and I must say it's fantastic. I think The White Stripes are the best rock band of our time and the fact that every album they produce sounds distinctly different from their last is very refreshing.I noticed that most of the people who dislike this album say something like ""But Elephant blah, blah, blah"", get over it, this album is not Elephant. And to be honest Elephant was my least favorite album, it sounded to polished and really lacked the rawness that you could hear in De Stijl or White Blood Cells.If you are only familiar with The White Stripes through Elephant this album may not be the best choice for you, however if you really liked all of their other albums then you probably have some understanding of what kind of band they are and would like Get Behind Me Satan."
4,"good, but not one of the White Stripes' better albums","Although this album focuses a lot more on blues than on the hard rock that has been typical of The White Stripes in the past, it still has the same great quality as well as plenty of peppy tracks. The best track in my opinion is the hit ""Blue Orchid"", which could use some more publicity because it rocks! This song has occasional wind noises, very hard guitar, and extremely catchy lyrics for a combination that begs to be blasted on a car stereo. Aside from this tune there are also piano-accompanied blues tracks, ones with marimba and occasional instrumental blasts, and some where Jack's voice rapidly darts from amplifier to amplifier. There is much variety on Get Behind Me, Satan, and although I think it is the least good of the Stripes' albums I would still proceed to give it a well-deserved four star rating.I recommend:Blue OrchidThe NurseMy DoorbellThe Denial TwistPassive ManipulationTake, Take, TakeRed Rain"
2,This is Experimental?,"Yeah right, pull the other one. Perhaps your brains have been addled by overexposure to ""music"" industry ""music"", that things like this become experimental. Freeform, avant-garde, you say? BS - this is neither technically compelling nor melodic.So, Lord of Karma, what do you say is experimental then? What do you say is cutting edge?I will tell you what - so called ""experimental works"" like this have yet to catch up to the 1969 debut of the Crimson King. Perhaps many of you have not heard great progressive or blues music since the 70s, no thanks to big record companies. Today, the 36-year old King Crimson turns out music which is around 1.61803399 times better than this? Nah, probably a thousand times.Check them out, and perhaps you will understand why music lovers shun cacophonic garbage like this."
2,My review,"First off I've been a big White Stripes fan since I saw them on SNL a few years ago. After that I immediately went out and bought their first three albums, listened to them lots and was hooked. Same with #4 when it came out. And I love their DVD too.But I thought this CD was just OK. I listened to it once, and then put it in the library for rotation. When I get a new CD that I like alot I listen to it everyday for three weeks straight. Sadly that was not the case this time.Although I didn't like this CD, I like supporting musicians as they experiment and grow. Better luck next time!"
4,Real Honest Country Blues!,"Nathan James and Ben Hernandez have made a lot of great music together. Nathan is a surprisingly strong delta blues singer and guitarist, and Ben's contributions on a variety of traditional country blues instruments are the perfect compliment. This is real deal back porch blues, the way you want to hear it. They make every effort to play the music the way it should be played. ""Make A Change Sometime"" and ""Hollerin'"" are both outstanding CD's. You can't go wrong with either. Nathan's CD, ""The Road Is Mine"" is equally good too, and maybe even better. If you like real deal, true to the music, vintage blues, this is a great album for you."
4,Norton Internet Security 3.0 family edition,"Having had a previous version of Norton Internet Security, I love the ease of use of this version and the ability it has to keep you informed of just what it is doing. I do wish that it would be more infromative as in just exactly it is blocking and from where, but it does give you peace of mind. More importantly it also protects your kids from objectionable web sites. I would definitely recommend it to anyone thinking about buying this type of software."
3,Necessary and Good enough,"If you have a DSL or cable connection you are probably already aware of the need for a firewall to protect your PC from attacks from the Internet. The firewall included in this package will provide that protection for you and is easy to install and manage, unlike more sophisticated but difficult to use products. The majority of the other features are also useful but not necessary. You will find that your browser already alows you to do most of those with the built in security. Getting a software that filters undesirable content is also something to consider. Overall, it is easy to use (I already installed it for a couple of friends) and necessary, especially if you are not a very advanced user."
2,not for 360 unless....,Not good for 360 unless you DO NOT need mute and volume control..........COMMUNICATOR piece (which has mute and vol contol) only works with original Xbox unless they are including a re-designed one that works with 360? Description makes no mention of vol/mute function. I wonder why? No picture - NO good.
4,Reviewing Pro Football Handbook 2000,"Great stats for individual players on offense. Could have used a little more information for defensive players. Also would have liked to have seen team stats and records, but I guess there are other books for that. Overall I thought that it was an excellent tool to garner up some information with. Will probably also purchase the 2001 edition when it comes out in August of 2001."
3,Good but a buy for only a true Thin Lizzy Fan,"This is the weakest of the Eric Bell era Thin Lizzy albums. Half of the album will not interest most people but there are a few quality songs(Brought Down, Baby Face, Call the Police). The production quality is poor by todays standards which can be expected of many albums of that time. There are a couple of good but very slow songs(Sarah, Shades of a Blue Orphanage) and one that should just be skipped(I Don't Want to Forget How to Jive). If you are interested in an album from the Eric Bell days, I would first recommend Thin Lizzy(electric folk debut album) then Vagabonds of the Western World(their 3rd album, the heaviest and last of the Eric Bell years)."
3,very good for the 3 piece era of LIzzy.,This is much better than the first album and show much improvement in songwriting for Phil. It's not the Jailbreaksound you'd expect but if your a fan of the band you'll enjoythe difference in the first few albums and the later ones. Ittook me back the first time I heard them but I enjoy themmuch more now. There isn't any new Lizzy to listen to so youmight as well get as much as you can. I love it.
3,fans only,"a must buy for die hard fans, otherwise avoid.shades of a blue orphanage is a rather odd, introspective album, full of strange songs about buffalos and growing up. however being a moody sod myself, i love it."
1,Plain awful,"The early Thin Lizzy wasn't good at all, and it wasn't until their fifth album ""Fighting"" they finally got their act together. Maybe you've heard ""The boys are back in town"", ""Waiting for an alibi"" or ""Don't believe a word"", and think this is how Thin Lizzy always sounded... Well, you won't find anything like the mentioned songs on this awful release. I'm just glad that the original guitar player Eric Bell finally left the band."
3,Tobacco Road,Not as amusing as when I first saw the movie years ago. Ward Bond was show briefly but should have had a bigger part. The same goes for the beautiful Gene Tierney
4,Tobacco Road - a funny drama,"My mom and dad were born around the Savannah, GA area. My dad remembers seeing this movie back in the 40's. There were many funny scenes and lines."
3,What is this?,This is not the story that I remembered. I certainly could be wrong. I would like to find the story (film) that I remember.
5,Movie,This is a fantastic classic and I'm really glad that I found it. The sevice was great and I received the movie in not time at all.
2,Very poor history,"This book, originally printed in 1921, shows its age in its biases. Ancient Greece was the most prominent influence on Western culture? I guess the Torah/Bible, which originated in the Middle East, isn't something secular scholars know of or concern themselves with;many would refer to it as the basis for ""Western"" thought. They also rely on long-refuted racial categories, talking about how ""Aryan"" invaders molded Greece into something important. The book obviously has not been updated enough through the years in order to keep up with science. It also makes little attempt to study modern education, as current issues like vouchers and charters get overlooked. Not recommended in the least - there has to be a better discussion of the topic out there."
5,History,Great History lesson on the making of American History and the pioneer who was one to start the building of the fur trade and trade of the American Indian.
3,Can Be Hard to Read,"Because the book is a reprint many of the pages are tinted and so difficult to read.Sincerely,John D. Miller"
4,Not to be listened to in your vehicle,"I love the swamp fox's music and the ladies he chose to be on this cd...esp Shelby Lynne. I gave it four stars instead of five because the first time I listened to it was while driving. I do have a great audio system in my vehicle, but still it's hard to actually hear and understand Tony's voice with the mix on this cd. This is best listened to in a quieter place. I felt that they should have brought his voice up a bit for the vocals...at times his voice seems to be a bit muddy and too much in the background."
3,"Promising, but not up to par with previous efforts","The first 3 tunes have the funk and ballad wizardry we have come to know from this talented musician.Sooner or Later I feel could have been a much bigger hit with some push from the record company.Still thinkin of you is produced by George Duke and one of Larrys best ballads. ""Don't stop when your hot"" is 80's funk w/ Larry's usual thumb power funkin strong.After that,hit or miss. Ballads, Let me come into your life and Your my girl sound like retreads we have heard before. An okay recording. ""One in a million you"" is better for ballads, ""Fired Up"" and ""Victory"" are better for your funky side."
5,Early works of the master.,"This 1950 collection is perhps a tad less sophisticated than some of his later work. But there are classics here that have stuck in my mind for at least that half-century. Who can forget""George, George, drop the keys!"" Or the mothballed captain on the bridge of the mothballed warship? Or the ghoul (later dubbed Uncle Fester) laughing as others weep in the movie theater?I had to have this book. It is classic literature that won't be found in any prescribed reading list. I bought it for my grandchildren.John CulletonRowse Reviews"
5,Funny Drama,"If you ever wonder how it would fill to be with to girls at the same time an worst thing is they are best friends, you should check this out it just like every school anime with a love triangle. There's this girl name Madoka who can kick a gang of guys butts;there's agirl name Hikaru who so pure, innocent,and naive to realize that boy name Kyosuke is an love with Madoka. In he just keep playing her for a fool but not on purpose."
2,"Oh boy, maybe if you never heard of JavaScript before...","It's basically trying to put JavaScript everywhere without any details or real-life actions.All exemples are very briefly explained and have provides NO BONUSES to anyone that have at least a small experience of JavaScript.My goal when purchasing this book was to learn new tricks with JavaScript since I'm coming from VB and VBScript so I wanted to learn the special things about JavaScript. LOOK ELSEWHERE IN THAT CASE.BUT, if you are looking at WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT AND WHERE CAN I USE IT? it might be an 'okay' start."
3,Good but could be better.,"This is a good introduction to JavaScript. I bought it in preferenceto the O'Reilly 'Javascript - The Definitive Reference' and to Danny Goodman's 'Javascript Bible', which, at the time were the only other serious books out there.If you want to learn DHTML you should get Danny Goodman's 'DHTML - The Definitive Reference'. Goodman's book is the DHTML bible but this Wrox book is better at Javascript. Yes, the Index and the continuity could be improved; the introduction to objects could be expanded with more and better examples; the regular expression section needs to be bigger. The case studies should have been dumped - they take up too much room, then the basics and reference could have been expanded.Unfortunately there really aren't any Javascript books which are significantly better. You must rely on web resources. Start with the Netscape site."
1,Not for beginners!,"Code examples are very poor and lack adequate explanation. Code on page 22 uses ""Clib.puts()"" . The only explanation is ""Our Example uses Clib.puts() to output to the screen- a call that's only made only on the server-side or most likely for running in a standalone JavaScript interpreter."" What does this mean and what would be a good example with a useful purpose? Another example comes in the description of ""Comma Operator"". ""What it does is evaluate its left value, throw the result away, evaluate its right value and pass that on. ... it allows you to put in your own side effects .."" No explanation is made about throwing away the left value and there is no explanation about ""side effects"" what they are and when you or how you might use them. Sorry, but its another book for me."
3,Poor language,"This book might have good content, but the language used is very poor. Not easily understandable for me atleast. And I feel that most of you who buy this book will face the same problem"
4,Everything you wanted to learn on JavaScript is in the book,"Including the discussion on JScript.NET. Excellent coverage on JavaScript, providing practical solutions. A must to have book for every Web developer."
3,Get your shovel out and start digging or buy another book,"The amount of digging you have to do in this book even to find the most basic of things is just ridiculous. There's a lot of fat and not enough quick and easy access to the info I need when I need it. A major disappointment considering it's from Wrox and has the word ""professional"" in its title. This book should be edited down to 500 pages from its current 1149 pages. I guess this is what happens when 7 different people write the same book concurrently and the editor forgets to do his job right. It does have good information, when and if you can find it. But who has time to dig through all that garbage?"
2,Definately not a good How-To book,"Over all I think that the book is O.K. but, If you are a hard core programmer that wants straight to the point How-To material ,this is the wrong book. I found myself almost falling asleep on some of the wording. I am an experienced programmer that is moving my skill set to Internet programming."
2,Index simply sucks,"OK, so I know this was not probably meant as a JavaScript reference. Then again, a good third of the book is reference appendices. These appendicies only go halfway -- they show the objects and their properties and methods, but not any of the syntax for invoking the methods. This makes the reference almost totally useless. That wouldn't be so bad if the index could point you to places in the text where these methods were explained in detail. However, this is the WORST index I've seen in any computer book.This book earns a 2 from me on the strnegth of Wrox's usual saavy tone and attention to detail in the text chapters, coupled with an unparalled depth covering emerging forms of server-side, embedded, and other forms of JavaScript. However, it would be THE ONE AND ONLY BOOK you'd need on the topic if only it had a damn index worthy of the name."
2,I would recommend another book,"Numerous authors listed on the cover and you will see why when you read this book. Very fragmented book, several topics are covered twice. Not a very useful reference book. The only thing that saves this book from being having a rating of one were some of the examples (which I used on one of my projects), and I found a couple of chapters had some decent explanations. A better book is ""Javascrip, The Definitive Guide by David Flanagan"". I found this book to be much more helpful."
1,Lost of pages of nothing,"All I know is this book has many pages, but its one of those books where you can find everything except what you are looking for."
2,poor,Where is the big screen ?. This is no bigger then the one I have. Hard to view in daylight. I am old need large screen.
4,Multi-Challenge Game,"I ordered two. My husband uses his, believe it or not, while sitting in his tree stand while hunting deer. He is successful every year.We both use it on our vacation flights. The multiple degrees of difficulty give you many options based upon your patience level each time you use it. The only negative is the marking pen. You cannot leave the cap off more than a minute without it drying and becoming unusable until you re-cover it for a period of time. Update; The pen is useless!"
5,I've lost my mother.,I got this as a gift for my mom this Christmas. She is completely in love with it. She says it's great because she doesn't have to worry about buying new Suduko books all the time anymore. However she is ALWAYS on it! I can't seem to peel it out of her hands! So I highly recommend it for anyone that loves the game or would love to learn. :-)
1,Difficult to use,"I have been searching for the perfect handheld sudoku game and this is not it. I found it very difficult to see the numbers without a backlight even with my reading glasses. Also I would perfer a stylus pen instead of having to scroll around the screen to enter a number. I do like the idea of being able to use a dry erase pen to mark off numbers, but I couldn't even see those. Still searching!"
4,One of the Greats,"Helen Hokinson was a cartoonist for the NEW YORKER in its glory years, and all or almost all these cartoons were originally published there. (Many were reprinted in the HOKINSON FESTIVAL, so if you own that there won't be a lot of surprises.)New to Hokinson? Like Arno and Steig, she specialized on a particular type of New Yorker--women of the upper middle class in the years before they were expected to have careers. If you remember Elwood Dowd's sister from HARVEY, you've got the Hokinson type--garden clubs, dog shows, amateur theatricals and ladies' auxilliaries. Seldom profound, but very funny. Worth the investment."
5,Best for people with Engineering background.,As a hardware engineer I would like the intricate details of programming on how actually the code works and if you are one like me then go for it. This book has builded enormous enthusiasm in me for java.One word of caution is it is not worth it if EXERCISES at the end of each chapter are neglected that why I called it the enginnering way.Great book Horton.
4,An adequate beginners book,"This book starts of nicely, however, it uses a lot of math related example which are of no use for a real programmer. After all this book is intended for programmers. Second, all chapters are related to one another. If you want to read information let's say on Collections you have to read the section on I-O steams because author uses some examples from previous chapters. Overall, this book is alright to start learning Java with."
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS - NOT FOR ANYONE,"Long, boring and poorly written. A great choise for a gift to someone you want to punish..."
3,obsolete items,"The first chapter I read from this book was on threading. It mentioned about stop() method. hm... this method has been deprecated in version 1.4 So I wonder, did they just change the cover of the 1.2 book and make it 1.4? Or, they actually revise the content to reflect this is the new Java version 1.4.I think it was written before 1.4 release came out. I haven't gone to wrok.com web site to see if there is an up-to-date information on this; hopefully the author is proactive about this."
4,Better Than The Average,I just got finished eight months of JAVA classes. This book makes it a little easier to understand some of the concepts that are poorly described in other books. I would definitely buy it for a backup to any other JAVA textbook you might be required to have. Since JAVA is my first language I was glad that I picked up this book.
3,"Good, but not great.","Although this book is certainly thorough (in fact, I find it works better as a reference than as a tutorial), the explanations tend to be too specific to the example codes, which themselves are not very practical. For the most part, you feel as if you are learning Java in a vacuum, with topics frustratingly insulated from one another.In terms of writing, Ivor Horton tends to be very verbose; many times I felt that what took two or three paragraphs to convey could easily have been condensed into one concise (and more accessible!) paragraph.That having been said, this book has proven useful at teaching me the principles of Java programming, although the chapters on File I/O were pretty useless. Look to Bruce Eckel's ""Thinking in Java"" for that..."
4,Good book for Programmers,"The title is abit misleading. I my self program in MARKIV and COBOL, and found this book very useful in helping me to learn JAVA programming. My friend on the other hand wanted to learn JAVA, with no programming knowledge and found it to be extremely useless. If you have no programming knowledge I suggest another book. My only beef is that he goes into too much detail on little things like variables. On the other hand great to learn concepts like OOP when coming from a structural programming backround. Also if your only desire is to lean applets this book may not be for you, the book builds from the bottom up and teaches the foundation of the language before getting into the more advanced stuff."
2,Hard to read (too much details for a beginner book),"I have been programming in Fortran, C, VB for 15 years. This book, in my opinion, has the following problems: 1.The huge amount of details could be organized in a better way.The author has put too much details into it right from the beginning. The readers are buried in it without seeing the big picture. It could happen that you fight through 1/3 of the book (that's already 400 pages with very small font size) but still don't know how to start to write a real Java program. 2. it would be better that the writing be in a more compact fashion. The author has spent lots of space (and did a good job ) in teaching good, general programming techniques, but I prefer getting to Java's real meat more quickly and directly. . I would love to give a 3 star, but since everyone else (almost) is applauding it, allow me to pull it down a little bit :-)"
2,Pros: THe book covers a great deal of information but...,"The books problems are:1. Horton uses too much math to teach java. If you are a math guy, then you will be happy. The problem with this approach is that abstract math in not usually seen in the programming scene! So why teach with it instead of using more real life examples!2. The books examples are boring, you don't get into windowing until chapter 10! Before that you watch JAVA preform as a glorified calculator in a DOS prompt window.3. The examples that actually build something build over many chapters, so you really don't see anything completed until you have read two trees worth of paper. It is far better to teach in small working examples so that the student can get a feel for the entire process."
2,Poor Content,Do not buy this book. It does not contain practical examples and lacks expanation of concepts.
4,Very Good but Lacking Polishing Touches,"I recommend the book because a) the examples are very useful, b)the general progression of the text is appropriate, c) the material covered is very exhaustive, d) it is the best beginning Java book I have found by far.My recommendatios for future improvement are: a)get Horton's picture off the front and back, b) provide fully coded answers to the exercises, c) break chapters 8 and 9 into smaller units (throughout the book there are places were the presented information can be overwhelming).If you are a true beginner - especially new to programming in general - this book can teach you how, but you will have to practice via the examples and exercises."
5,The best book on Java 2 I have seen yet!,I have many books on java and by far this is the best book if you have some programming background but are unfamiliar with the Java syntax. Look at this before any other book. Explains complicated concepts clearly and simply. You will really feel as if you understand it. Give you confidence to continue.
1,Waste of Trees,"Boy, how disappointing, how frustrating - the author does not answer so many simple questions (How do I create a text file? How do I set System properties at startup?) There is a total lack of decent examples. Go get the Nutshell book."
3,OK deal for a price,"The book arrived in time as mentioned on amazon.com. However, the book was no where near ""Like New"" condition (as said in the product description)."
4,Nice Book,"It was overly rated but still is a good book to start with. I'd recommend the Bruce Eckel's ""Thinking in Java""."
4,Good but may be a little too much,I had the previous version of this book and lost it so I bought the new version because I really liked the one I had. Unfortunately my experience has been a little different with this version. It contains a lot of great information however I think it may have too much in it for most beginners and novices. It is also a very thick book and takes up a lot of space when carrying around.The information is great in the book but it isn't something you'll be able to hold in with the first read.
2,Not for Beginners - get another book,"I'm currently using this as a textbook in a Java 2 course. Needless to say, I'm doing not so well in the course! I suspect that this book itself was written for another audience, but branded as ""for beginner"" in the latter stages of publishing. For starters, this book is an intimidating 500+ monster-- information overload for any new programming beginner. Overall, I don't find the examples very useful as well; perhaps I'm just not connecting with the author. The information contained in here is very extensive, and may be useful for a reference guide, but for the true beginner, I recommend Java 2 A Beginners Guide, by Herbert Schildt. It's cheaper, has a good logical flow with excellent examples, and it's not so easy to get lost in!"
2,not for serious programmers,"This book is a good intro for someone who has never programmed before; however, if you are serious about really learning java this is not the book for you. This book doesn't even contain a chapter on network programming. The author is very chatty and it takes him forever to make a point. The examples also don't apply to real world situations.If you want to learn java and begin producing useful programs fast, I suggest reading Thinking in Java by Bruce Eckel, which is available for free on-line, or getting Core Java volumes 1 and 2 published by Sun."
4,Not for people who know other languages,"I completely concur with other reviewers assessment that this book is for folks who are new to programming. For the novice, this book goes into a lot of detail and does a lot of carefull, and (helpfully) repetitious, description. I would definitely recommend this book for the novice.But if you know another language already (especially an object oriented one), you'll go nuts wading through the detail and repetition. Having made this realization, I switched to Bruce Eckel's _Thinking In Java_ (3rd ed.) and am delighted with it. You can easily execute his sample code along with your reading and modify as needed to experiement. His explanations of the language are to the point and clear for people who are already familiar with OO programming. If you are not familiar with OO, it's still good because he does go over the concepts. His approach gets you into Java really quickly and and at a meaningful level of detail."
2,Who are these people giving good comments about this book?,"Yo, I don't know who is keep writing these good comments about this book, but I don't think it is worth to buy this book if you are a beginner in Java. Study Java through Web tutorial such as Sun Microsoft has. Then if you need more basic stuff, then buy a book such as this. This book won't help for beginner. You just won't understand and you'll get really bored!"
4,Great Bluegrass,"A very nice Bluegrass music video of a live show celebrating the life of Bill Monroe. Check this one out, if you are a Bluegrass purist......This is for you. The video is very well produced and clear and the audio is first class. Checkout the list of performers...A ""Who's Who"" in Bluegrass music. I recommend this to any fan of Bluegrass music."
2,Stunningly boring,"Maybe the most overrated book ofthe year. Gaarder is playingwith one single idea, notknowing how to fill in hundredsof pages. What to do? Put in aphilosophy primer, of course! Apoor story makes a perfect giftfor your enemies..."
3,How disappointing !,"I don't understand the commotion about this book. It is a nice book for someone with no background in philosophy, especially a high school student, but if you have a grasp of the basics this back will provide little extra. As a novel, it is an utter dissapointment, intellectually unchallenging and well yes silly. If you already know a little about philosophy, look elsewhere"
3,A book for young teenagers,"Sure, this is a good introduction to the philosophical history, and baking it into a novel makes it more available. But still, the prose in this novel is not good, it's banal and cheap, it rides on a great idea which is not given a chance to blossom, you could do much more out of this, the pathetic plot destroys the experience, and furthermore it's written in a language suited fo children or young teenagers, but on the other hand, maybe that's who it's written for and that's the reason I don't apreciate it...oh well, but still, it's not a waste of time, it's worth reading.."
2,Teacher's Lesson Plans Masquerading As Novel,"This is not a novel; a teacher (the author Gaarder's former profession) opened up his lesson plan book, strung all the philosophy lessons together, added a tepid plot and a protagonist named Sophie, and, well, he somehow got a best-seller!Gaarder must have been a FANTASTIC teacher, but he's a weak novelist. But I might give this book to an academically-inclined junior high schooler who likes to read, for it IS a very accessible introduction to the history of philosophy"
1,"horrible, boring, downright stupid","Please save yourself the time and money and refrain from this book which is borderline antisemitic and is plain BORING. I never heard of this author and now I understand why.It did serve me well when I needed some paper to start off my grill fire this summmer, but I supoose that I could have found cheaper source than that.In short - pure and unadulterated boredome!!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!!!!!,"Sophie's World was horrible!!! The whole book is not even a story, it was just a way for the author, Jostein Gaardner, to get his thoughts out on philosopy to people. I found myself skimming parts of it, and the characters had no depth to them, because the whole book is an annoying trick. Good luck if you buy this- it is in no means a fast read."
1,Sophie's World,"This book was really, really bad. IF not for the fact I was forced to read every little poorly written page for my class, i would have stopped on page 2. Do not get this pile of paper that some one has tried to pass off as a book. IT is nothing more than a textbook that has a pointless and stupid story line. The author seems to have never met any one in their teens because the young girl in this is way to smart for her age. Not to menchian the fact that she follows the direction of a complete stanger. Buy this and suffer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Teaching tool for philosophy,"This is a great book for introducing kids to philosophy. As the book mentions, philosophy isn't something we can learn- but we can learn to think philosophically (something lost in chaos of our materialist world). The lessons within are much needed for an era that has lost the value of thinking and learning to ask the right questions. If we can get our kids to be good thinkers, trust me- they'll be successful at whatever endeavors they undertake."
4,A book that generate interest in Philosophy,"I am ordering this book for my 13 years old boy, who starts to show interest in serious books.I read this book a few years ago. I never had much of western philosophy history, so this book was an eye opener for me.The few pages of each topics not only give a summary or synopses of the philosophers and his/her idea, they generate interest that can be follow up with more reading in the topics.As many noted, it is the story that is make me gives this book a 4 stars. Without the philosophy lesson, the story would get even lower rate from me."
4,Very entertaing for the people that doesn't know philosophy!,"For a starting the idea of this novel is great, because it's a mixture of a story with the most resumed history of philosophy, since Greek philosophers up to contemporary philosophers. The story tells how a teenager discovers the world around her taught by a philosopher that suddenly appears in her life and teaches her not to live in the mediocrity of humanity, to delve deeply in questions as who you are, or how the world began. This book is great for teenagers because it helps them to think different and to analyze all these types of questions and not to become into pragmatics."
4,A work that can change your way of seeing the world.,"Reading Sophie's World means you will not be likely to let it go. In a easy way, the author leads us to a very exciting and worthy trip: the human thought. And we find out that anyone can be a thinker! Meantime, a parallel story is told and perhaps this is the coolest thing on the book. It's interesting the means by which Jostein Gaarder can proof that maybe our world is nothing but a dream, such as Sophie's own history. However, when the book reveals its secrets and another story is told, the author seems to lose the control of it, and the story gets a little poor and even childish. That's why it deserves 4 stars."
5,Very simple introductory book,This is a simple read and easy to understand book about the history of philosophy. Major concepts and ideas of various philosophers are introduced in the contents of a story about a young girl receiving a mysterious mail. The book covers philosophical ideas from pre-Socratic era to modern time. The author was successful in relating the development of different thoughts. Plenty of examples are given to clarify the philosophical concepts and the story itself elicits the reader to reflect and ponder about the presented ideas.
3,Sophies World,I bought this book for a philosophy class I am taking. The book was a very good intro to philosophy and gives the ideas in creative ways. While it was good at giving the history and evoking thought I felt the story was a little lame and probably wouldn't read it for just the fun of it.Great book if you want to know about philosophy mediocre book if you just want to read a good story.
5,Great Book,"I thought taking an online philosophy class would be quite difficult. But the book assigned made this class easy to take. Sophie's World breaks down philosophy in a way where it is so clear to understand. This book presented the ideas of difficult thinkers such as Descartes, Aristole, Plato, Socrates, Nietzsche, Herclitus, Empedocles, and many more in such a way where anyone could understand it.I would this book to anyone who is interested in philosophy and even someone just looking for a good reading.Tayler"
4,Engaging - Philosophy meets the Matrix,"This is an engaging story encapsulating an introduction to Western philosophy. While working out the mystery of the story, the reader is invited to consider, if obliquely, the nature of existence. It certainly kept me turning pages as I became reacquainted with authors and theories I had read as an undergraduate in philosophy. In many cases, the key points made by deep thinkers such as Kant were so very clearly phrased that I wished I had this a resource so many years ago.Women philosophers are unfortunately missing in this, as so many, surveys of philosophy. Also, the story ends rather abruptly, leaving something of a void in the reader - which may have been the point of the ending after all. If so, it is remarkably good art as well as a fine survey of philosophy."
5,This is one of the best books I have ever read,"This book is so incredibly wonderful, It has touched me and made me take a deeper interest on the subject of philoshophy , It was so wonderful to me because I have often wondered everythng , and I have read it 12 times over and over just yo rethink everything and get a different opinion."
4,A SOFT INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY,I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in philosophy in early ages.I read this book about two years ago when I was fifteen and learned so much about life and basic points of philasophy.
5,mind-changing,"This book shows everybody, that it is important to get out of the cage of normal life. It tells you that you ask every day WHY things happen and WHY we do what we do. WORLD IS NOT WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE."
2,"but overall, a good book (if you take out about 400 pages)","Although many views and ideas expressed in the book are the same as mine, they should have been expressed in a plot, not in textbook form. I hope we get to read more of these kinds of books, just not as big."
3,*grunt*,"it started off quite well, and it has a rather weird (ie: interesting) plot, but towards the end, it got loooooooong and tiresome and the ending was *ahem* ....."
3,"good for the kids, but adults, read something more serious","a superficial introduction to the world of western philosophy. covers it all, but in the end is not really interesting. this is great, however, for teenagers."
3,"overrated, mediocre fiction, but nice to philosophy","no one should mistake this for masterful fiction. it is not. rather gaarder's story is a nice delivery vehicle for a basic and interesting introduction to philosophy.so if you are looking for great literature, look elsewhere. if you are looking for an easy to read and relatively entertaining [though lengthy] introduction to western philosophy, pick this up."
3,Good introduction into the fascinating world of philosophy,"I found this novel to be hugely entertaining and very easy to read. Many times, people are put off by the idea of philosophy because they think that anything having to deal with it must necessarily complicated and almost incomprehensible for the average human being. This novel helps break down some of these barriers in a very nice way. I do think that this bool should be taken as it is: only an INTRODUCTION to philosophy. It largely skips many things and just gives a very slight overview of many philosophical currents. This is an entertaining work that will surely pique the curiosity of many young readers...it's greatest strength."
4,"Very good piece, but some issues.","I though Sophie's World was a great book. It does a really nice job of covering philosophy and philosophers from the ancient times (like Plato, Anaximander, and Socrates), up to more modern times (Freud, Marx.)I rated this book with four stars because of two main reasons. Reason one is how the philosophy is taught through the mail is unclear, and reason two is that sometimes you can get lost in the many plots being presented at once.Overall, a great introduction to this very broad field."
4,A Wonderful Book for Everyone,"Sophie's World is a great book that weaves the history of philosophy into a mystery. What makes this book appealing is that if you took out the actual plot and published it as a book on the history of philosophy, it would be an interesting one. If you took out the actual lessons in philosophy, this book could stand on its own as an exciting mystery. Not only is this book well written and well thought out, it challenges the philosopher in everyone."
3,Insightful read...,"An enriching textbook on philosophy and different viewpoints of various philosophers over the centuries. Points brought up in the book are very much worth pondering and set me off thinking constantly during the read. However, I must admit that certain parts of the book bored me and the ending was pretty unsatisfactory and seemingly too rushed."
4,Great for beginners,"If you come at this book from the perspective of the a child about the age of Sophie, it is spectacular. If you instead are expecting a tretise for adults you will be mystified and wholly annoyed. The point of the book is to present the many thoughts and theories on the existance (or non-existance) of the universe in a creative and inspiring manner in order to spawn imagination on the subject of what is ""real?"" Or if you'll pardon the Clintonism: what ""is"" means.This author manages to make the history of thought interesting. As someone who merely dabbles in philosophy, I really enjoyed this book."
5,One of the Best I've Read,"I have seldom read a ""novel"" with so much attraction. I would go to bed at night angry I couldn't read more...an exhausting yet invigorating book. I plan to use it with my philosophy classes next year. I guess that the nain reason is that we are all afraid of being Sophie, trapped in someone else's creation, yet still able to find (hopefully) some sense of independence and freedom. Again, one of the finest books written, I have read since two others by Gaarder: Solitaire Mystery, and the Christmas Mystery."
5,My all-time favorite book,"I just had to write a review for this book because it is my all-time favorite. It's a perfect introduction to the history of philosophy, but it's not dry like most text books. Instead, it is a story told through a child's eyes with a great plot line running through it. It covers all the major philosophers. My favorite aspect of this book is the fact that it ties all the philosopher's thoughts together, showing how each of them builds on previous philosophers. It's easy to understand and a quick read. For anyone interested in the history of philosophical thought and wants a brief over-view of major philosophers, let this book be first on your list. If you have taken a few philosophy classes like I have, you'll want to read this book as well because it ties the subject together in one cohesive book."
5,By far the best introduction to philosophy,"In ""Sophie's World"" a letter in a Sophie's mailbox with 2 questions written on it lead Sophie to discover the history of Philosophy and how it affects her (and our) modern life.Sophie's World is a classic that will be taugh in schools for decades to come."
4,This really was a wonderful book.,"Sophie's world is a wonderful way to present philosophy to people of all ages. It was nice to find a book that I can read and relate to. My father and i both read the book together and it was fun. I am a child, with a high reading level, but it could still be a little confusing.I recomend it very much to anyone wanting a fun and interesting way to learn about philosophy."
3,"Too much fact, great plot.",I thought the book was interesting yet dull. I thought the plot was great. But I didn't like the fact that the whole book was mostly straight out fact. I found myself wanting to skip through the lessons and read the actual story. Overall it was a pretty good book. But one should only read it if they want a lesson on philosophy.
3,"The book was good, but the meat of it was a textbook","I believe that Sophie's World was an interesting read. By interesting I mean that the end was entertaining but getting to the entertaining part was very slow going. Also, knowing that this is a novel about philosophy, the prase ""creative textbook"" is accurate but would be more so without the creative. Half the time while reading, I was learning too much and could not fully enjoy the plot of the book. I kept, what was going to happen, when would it happen? Then the letters of philosophy would interrupt those thoughts. In the end, the book was all right adn as best said by the Kirkus Reviews, a wonderfully ""creative textbook""."
5,Fantastic,"This is the best Philosophical resource I have come by. It is understandable and has all the facts and ideas of all the great philosophers. The genre is of a kind I have never seen before, but it works brilliantly. I would recommend it to anyone with a ""love for wisdom"" [what ""philosophy"" means]"
5,Journey into the self,"Philosophy is certainly a complex matter if one researches in how it has come to be and what is happening to it at present. When one comes to encounter it, usually as part of the required subjects to be taken in college, one would generally be overwhelmed by the myriad ways of thinking that diverge and do battle in Philosophy.So if you need a primer, what better way than through a lecture in the form of a story? This metafiction-cum-lecture is the easiest way to get a grip on how man thinks about himself and secures his place in the cosmos. Divided carefully into letters which contain the lectures, it provides for easy transition from one mode of thinking to another. And since it's in the form of a story, one need not get bored as it goes on.This book is best read when one is only at the doorstep of understanding philosophy. And believe me, this book is just the ticket to loving it."
3,Not quite as good as its reputation,"Sophie's World is a good way to get yourself started if you want to read about philiosophy.But the fact that Jostein Gaarder attempts to explain philosophy in a fictional frame is not only a strength. It becomes a weakness in as much as the novel fades more and more towards the end, instead of growing more and more exciting. Gaarder plays a bit with meta effects but gets to little out of their possibilities. Maybe because he wants too many things."
5,Love it!,"To date I've bought 27, yes twenty-seven, copiesof this book. Jostein Gaarder did a great job writing it. Sophie is a young girl, who finds herself enrolling in... a correspondence course of sorts regarding philosophy... before long she finds herself in an Alice-in-Wonderland sort of aventure through her life, and someone named Helga's. The book was written for children, by a childrens teacher to help them learn philosophy and to help develop a philisophical view on life. I've given a copy of this book to many many people that I know and they've all enjoyed it. I suggest reading it a few times after you purchase it. Now stop reading my review and BUY THIS BOOK!-Ryan Mercer"
3,Philosophically challenged,I am sure this is a good book for those of you who are interested in the history of philosophy. This book was interesting in the way it presented the information to you. I enjoyed the background plot more than the idea of philosophy. But then I am not one to get too philosophical about much. Go for it if you are up for a challenge. It is worth the time and effort.
4,Sophie's World,"A very good novel, which introduces a concise view of western philosophy development within an amazing story."
5,Sophie's World: Philosophy at its best,I read this book twice already. It's great to get some perspective on the world that surrounds us. A greater appreciation for life ...
2,very poor and boring plot,"This is a feable attempt to teach philosophy and in the same time build an interesting plot. The parts of the book regarding history and philosophy are generally o.k. (although too simplistic), but the story itself is pathetic."
5,sophie's world changes your whole perspective on life,"sophie's world is one of those few books that acually affects the life of the person reading it. unlike many novels, which only exist for entertainment purpopses, sophies world not only entertains, but educates as well. Basically, 99% of western philosophy is covered, chapter by chapter, giving the reader an overview of western thought, enlightening while still staying engrossing, sophie's world is a ""must read"" for anyone out there who actually cares about the world thier living in."
2,"Hold the garnish, I'll just take the meat","Frustrating! While enlightening in weaving the historical thread of philosophy, the story which frames this mini-course is frail, erratic and finally ludicrous. While I enjoyed the philosophy, which truly broadened my perspective on the thinking life of we humans, the story itself made me cringe."
5,An astronomically astounding read: brilliant!!!,"From cover to cover, I was enthralled, no enraptured by this excellent novel. I just could not put the book down. Gaarder maintains the balance between fact and fiction brilliantly, and the novel fascinated me throughout. I have always been interested in philosophy, but I struggled to find a book that gave a simple yet informative guide to one of the most interesting topics in the world. Gaarder has produced that book. Well done"
5,Much more then a novel about the history od philosophy!,"To say that Sophie's World is a novel about the history of philosophy, is like saying that The Odyssey is a travel story. The story within the story brings the work to life. At one point I had to put the book down and pause in amazment at Jostein Gaarder's skill at teaching and weaving a tale."
5,"Ladies and Gentlemen, we are floating in Space","Sophie's World is the savior to would be philosophy students around the world (ie: everybody alive in this reality). This is the book that will allow you to be floating in space, examining the history of thought, and asking questions that maybe you couldn't ask yourself before. Concise, yet thorough when dealing with the different schools of philosophical thought, Jostein Gaarder has made what could be a tedious task extremely exciting, entertaining, and provoking. Sophie, Alberto, Hilde, and Major Knag , not to mention Mr. Gaarder himself, will open the minds of any reader who dares to dare themself."
2,"too much philosopy, not enough plot- BORING!!","I had to read this book in the summer for AP European History and was at first excited to learn about philosophy using a semi-fictional book. I was wrong. This book is simply an excuse to write a short textbook on the history of philosophy with only hints of an alterior plot thrown in. It took me weeks to get through this one and I was put into the terrible state of wanting to blow the book to pieces each time I started reading. If you are in fact interested in philosophy and simply want to have a concise history of the subject then this book is an excellent source, but I would clearly not recommend it to those of the weak hearted who simply want a good read."
2,as good as cliff's notes--and you know how good those are,"If you're already pretty familiar with western philosophy, this book will read like a Cliff's Notes stitched awkwardly to a weak story. The plot became tedious after a while, and I thought the writing style was childish. This could have been due to poor translation, but I doubt it. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the book if I'd encountered it when I was a child, as this seems to be the author's intended audience. If you're interested enough in philosophy to even consider reading this book, you should read the real thing or at least better introductory books on the subject. Philosophy: An Introduction Through Literature by Kleiman and Lewis is a good bet."
1,Philosophy in the Mud,"As a lover of philosophy, I was simply infuriated by ""Sophie's World"". The treatment of the great philosophers and their ideas is so shallow that it is simply revolting. The characters are flat and unconvincong, the dialogues are artificial, and the plot is smart-alecky and pretentious. My only hope is that young readers will not be satisfied with this book and look for ones which do more justice to this most virtuous of human pursuits. If you have not yet read ""Sophie's World"", I beg you - leave this mass-market piece of junk on the shelf. It will give you the worst possible misconceptions. For an excellent and interesting account I would recomment Brian Magee's ""The Great Philosophers"", and for economic thought - Robert Heilbroners's ""The Worldly Philosophers""."
1,Don't waste your money...,"This is a poorly written novel that pretends to be philosophical but doesn't quite make it. The dialogues are terrible, pre-packaged, cooked up, unbelievable. The idea is stupid: a recast of a high school philosophy textbook into series of letters from a creepy old man to a 14 year old girl. This is a bad way of getting teens into philosophy. Anyone with brains would prefer to read Plato or Nietzsche directly to being stalked by self-proclaimed philosopher. The novel is clearly aimed to people who are not capable going to the sources get the real deal. This is philosophy for sophists."
1,I would have given it negative stars if I could,Sophie's World is a philosophy text book with a small unrelated and poorly written story thrown in between sections. A horrible book.
1,worst book i've read,"This book was terrible! I actually enjoy philosophy but even the philosophic parts were terrible. This book was incredibly slow and dry and the plot was ridiculous. I can see what the author was trying to get at but it was just completely awful, if i could give this book negative stars i would."
1,Just can't finish it,"I've always been interested in philosophy, but this is just too dull. Not enough time is devoted to any one school of thought to give more than the bare bones of the ideas involved.This kid instantly grasps entirely new (to her) concepts in a way no 15-year old ever would. And I wanted to slap her after a while because I was so sick of all her cute, sarcastic remarks during her lessons. Plus, how smart could she really be to not only give a strange man her address, but to tell him what times of day she would be alone?When I finally decided I couldn't finish it, I looked ahead to see if the ""big twist"" I'd been anticipating all along did in fact pan out, and sure enough, there it was."
1,a simple-mimded author,"I regard the author as simple minded, almost primitive in his thought processes. He rehashes old points of view with a sense of his own moral superiority. Disgraceful."
2,what a bore,sophies world is a decent book an nothing more than that i find that Jostein Gaarder was trying to hard to crame the History of Philosophy in to 523 pages. the book seemed like a text book and the only way i could get thru reading it was wanting to know what would happen to sophie who in my opinion was one dimensional and had no depth i frankly didn't care much about her Philosophy lessons and skimmed most of them take my advice dont read this book even if you are fasinated with philosphy a text book will do u much better than ths rubbish.
1,Surprised,"It absolutely bowls me over that so many people thought this was a great book. I must be out of touch with how most people think. I thought this book was silly and now after a few years I hardly remember any of it. The books I have enjoyed remain in my mind for decades as joyous, wondrous vacations. This one was fluff, pure fluff -(in my 'umble opinion)."
4,excellent book,i gave this book as a gift for my niece's birthday. i read it many times and wanted to pass along the excellent book
5,Incredible,"Thank you, Mr Gaarder.This book opened a world of ideas for me.It succeeded in its purpose of making philosophy a much more accesssible part of life, not merely a study of meaning, purpose, thought and ideas, but actually real and applicable. Having followed more than one philosophy course in the past, I found this book to be at least as useful and infomative, if not more so.An incredible resource, reference book and a good story too; this is what he does, Mr Gaarder, he takes a concept, a principle, field, or a historical person, and breathes life into it. Love it!"
4,a good book that is widely appreciated,"A lot of people really love this book as a creative introduction to philosophy. The philosophic material has been incorporated into a novel surrounding a young girl in Norway. I liked the book, and I am extremely impressed at the creative thinking that went into writing something like this. The problem I had was that I didn't identify too much with the story, and would have preferred just straight discussions on philosophy. For me, reading something like The Story of Philosophy is more interesting. I do realize that the reading preferences of many others could make this book something extremely special to them, and well-suited to exploration of philosophical principles. I know plenty of people feel that way about the book, and I really admire the book because of that. Anything like this, that can inspire and interest in philosophy among young and old readers alike has enormous value. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about philosophy."
4,Sophies World is also my world!!,"I was always interested in philosophy, but I was not so sure about its history n evolution.This book not alone tells us just that but it it also has its sub-plots. It not only makes us aware of the whys n wherefores but also makes sure that we start thinking about it in our day to day lives.It is a must read for every person, not just teens for whom it was written.Enjoy Sophies world and lets make it our world!!"
5,Simplicity without trivializing.,The major achievement of Gaarder's book is the way he brilliantly conveys complex ideas in a simple language without trivializing these ideas.
5,Very good book and very useful for clever kids!,"Gaarder's novel is at the same time a good narrative book and a pedagogical tale, very useful for children: this book will help them to give an answer to many essential questions about world, nature, science, religion. The writing is easy, and even toughest concepts become simple thanks to Gaarder's expositive clarity. A perfect birthday present for any boy or girl who wants to know more and more about the world."
3,From Viking Gods to Freud: a surreal mystery,"While there is a great deal of philosophical thought covered in relatively short order (500 pages in print version), the device of question and answer between the teacher and student is tedious. The puzzles in the interludes between pedagogy lead to a mind-boggling conclusion. My sympathy to the young narrator Sophie and her guide to the world of thought, Alberto, who finally melt away like the Cheshire Cat. Be hopeful and remember, ""The only thing we require to be good philosophers is the faculty of wonder."""
4,Good Information,"As the title ""Sophie's World : A Novel About the History of Philosophy"" says, this sure is a novel about the history of philosophy. Jostein Gaarder did a reasonable good job in holding the reader's attention through the philosophical lessons using a very novel plot (it is not very difficult for the history of philosophy to be dry.) I developed a very keen interest in philosophy recently but I never had a formal education in philosophy. This book was like a text book in philosophy for me. I think this is a must read for every novice philosopher (might still be a good read for others too)"
5,The easiest way to read philosophy,"This book is written like a fairy tale with sharp weaves of philosophy. If you ever wondered who Freud was, or what Nietchze said or about Hobbes - then this is the book for you. It is simply written and is a great way to start a off-campus course in Philosophy. Happy reading!"
4,"A little brief, but...","It is a creative way to introduce philiosophic concepts to high schoolers. A number of important philsophers are not discussed at all or very cursorily. No mention at all is made of Roman philosophy, nothing is mentioned about John Dewey's philosophy and nothing about the pragmatic views of William James. Much more could have and should have been done with Francis Bacon. But, much is accomplished in only a few hundred pages. A worthy effort"
5,DON'T BELIEVE THE NAYSAYERS!,"Reviewers who complain the plot of this book is weak, that the ending is a ""cop-out"", that the story line gets ""too weird"" have, in my opinion, totally misunderstood the point of the novel, and have not paid proper attention to the philosophy lectures embedded in the novel. READ THE SUBTITLE - it's a novel about the history of philosophy! The clues to the plot are in the philosophy, and the plot, as well as the ending, make perfect sense provided you have understood the philosophy.I would like to thank the reviewer who warned me not to read the Kirkus review. WARNING AGAIN - DO NOT READ THE KIRKUS REVIEW UNTIL YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE BOOK! AMAZON, YOU SHOULD REMOVE THIS REVIEW - IT GIVES THE WHOLE GAME AWAY!"
2,meh,"I have serious problems with this book, which was recommended to me by many people, of whose opinions I am now in doubt. The book serves its purpose well, to educate fiction-readers about the history of philosophy, increase our sense of wonder about the world, etc. However, the book has no sense of wonder for its own characters, its plot, or its literary choices. The novel is not written well at all and there is little if any character development. It's a poorly-masked attempt to increase the points of access for philosophy, but the voice of the main character is oversimplified and insults the reader's intelligence. This book actually made me enjoy philosophy even less than I already do, though it did succeed in answering the question of why we continue to study it at all. Still, the writing is awful."
3,A 12 y/o perspective (By Max Bowen),"The plot waters down the philosophical content. The characters are boring, and the story gets in the way of the academics. Thus, the history of philosophy itself, in the later half at least, is just a snippet of the big picture. I think the book would have been more interesting if the characters had more personality and were not like card-board."
3,Philosophy Crib Notes,"I have to admit that this was pretty heavy going for much of the time. I plodded through diligently, more to 'learn' a bit more about the various philosophies than anything else. But then, I didn't retain anything, so I might as well have read a text book! The contemporary story didn't really grip me. Not bad to fill in some time, but not exactly my cup of tea. It might prove useful if I ever need to have a Cheat Notes version of several philosophers. Fortunately, there's an index to help."
2,only for those who are too lazy to read the actual works.,"I have to say that I did not enjoy this book at all. It was practically like reading a philosophy text book, and the story is a rather feeble and weak attempt to make the book interesting. I found myself quite insulted as I was forced to choose between reading the philosophy part and skipping the story of Sophie or viceversa. I recommend that if anyone is truly interested in philosophy that he reads the actual works of Plato and company."
2,A textbook read.,"I picked up Sophie's World at the wrong time. Between school and a busy homelife, I needed some quick reading and this certainly wasn't light reading!The history of philosophy is, of course, very detailed. Jostein Gaarder has written an in-depth, fascinating book, but unfortunatelly, one has to be in a specific state of mind to be able to follow along, and come away from this wonderful literary experience with everything the author intended.So, to recap, great book, but only pick it up if you have the time and interest in being completely absorbed in the very detailed, and often dry, history of philosophy and the world in general.Not unlike reading a textbook -- fascinating, but often boring."
3,The History of Philosophy,"Tries to be a kid's book starring Sophie which covers the history of philosophy, but instead ends up being a book known for covering the history of philosophies. At least that's how it was talked-up to me. I didn't find the narrative pacing very compelling, but it is good for philosophic fundamentals. Did the name 'Sophie' come from the ""sophic"" in 'philosophic'?Anyway, acted like a philosophical refresher course for me. While not a bad reading experience, it read more like non-fiction than fiction."
3,"Not impressed at all,","Not impressed at all. As a brief introduction to philosophy it's ok I guess. But the instructional goal was intertwined with a story that, in my humble opinion, is rather shallow and lame. Moreover, that ""literary"" part of the book involves some uncalled for mystic metafiction that in my opinion was rather poorly realized. I jotted down numerous :rolleyes: notes all over the book. Wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather recommend ""Antimanual de Filosofia / Antimanual Philosophy: Lecciones Socraticas y Alternativas / Socratic and Alternative Lessons (Ensayo) (Spanish Edition)"" by Michel Onfray, even though I have only browsed it superficially, but seems to be a much more promising book for introducing philosophy to a similar audience, without extraneous literary attempts."
3,Sophie's World: A History of Philosophy,"Interesting storyline that kept my interest; however, I must admit that I skimmed the philosophy lessons. Reading about the great philosophers is a little too much like Philosophy 101. Would I recommend the book? Probably not unless I knew the person was interested in Philosphy."
2,Not What it Was Cracked Up to Be...,"It's been a while since I read it. I remember being disappointed, that the whole thing was a build-up to a rather pedestrian, anti-climactic denouement. I'm not sure that wasn't the intention, but I just remember thinking that the book had been hyped way beyond its significance."
5,A small REVIEW... ( Wonderful book),"I would recomend this book to people who like Philosophy... This is a great book about a girl who knows nothing about philosophy and one day gets an evelope in the mail.... She soon finds out its a big connection with her dad and a girl named Hilde. I loved this book it does take a while to read but once you read this book u'll have a different point of veiw on philosophy. It teaches you everything you need to know , and truly not a boring book... I reccomend this book and i give it Five Stars...thanks.....sacha"
2,Turned off by anti-semitic content,"This is not meant to be a comprehensive review. I actually found the book quite interesting until I got to the point near the end of the book where the author attempts to describe Judaic and Christian philosophy. One can infer from his writing that he subscribes to the notion that Christianity is the successor to Judaism, and that Judaism is now obsolete. This is, of course, offensive to Jews. Also, since I know that his understanding of the relationship of Judaism and Christianity is incorrect, it makes me doubt his knowledge of other philosophies. I would otherwise have no reason to doubt the validity of the rest of the book, since this was an introduction to philosophy for me, but I now doubt the author's understanding of all the rest."
1,This Book is Garbage,"This book is absolute garbage. This text is approachable, but at the expense of insight and substance. If you can choke down the terrible, tacked on plot, you will be left with a trite and cursory look at basic philosophical issues. It reads like it was written by the book's moronic main character."
1,"Very very very childish and BORING, only for girls....","A very informative introduction to philosophy, but thats as far as it goes. Based around an extremely weak story which might appeal to a twelve year old girl. I wish I'd thrown it away as instinct told me."
4,A Good Introduction to Philosophical Ideas--especially for young people,"In a novel with echoes of Through the Looking Glass, a young girl begins to receive philosophy lessons from a mysterious stranger."
4,Creatively imagined,"It's ironic that so many of the American reviewers think so little of this book. Though the Kirkus Reviews anticipated this by calling American readers ""too savvy"" to enjoy this, I think they are bit off the mark. Americans may be too shallow or contemptuous of the esoteric. This is a novel for more refined tastes and interests; it is not for the sensationally superficial reader needing airplane reads, blatant sex, violence, or gore. it is more like a European film. Though genuinely unique in its approach, it can get a bit pedantic. However, if you are a thinker, or a blossoming thinker of any depth, there is a remarkably childlike effect at work here."
2,It was a school assignment,"I had to read this book for my 9th grade Intro to Ideas class. While many of my peers despised the book, I somewhat liked it, but only because I had already had an innate interest in philosophy. Yes, this is a thinly disguised textbook with a ridiculous, unimaginitive plot. The book would actually have been better as a textbook without the pathetic storyline, or whatever storyline you try to make out of it"
4,When philosophy becomes a game ...,"Sophie's World is one of the books that really triggered me.Through the life of a little girl,Sophie, you get the chance to know the history of philosophy in depth.The reason I recommend this book is its highly innovative approach to philosophy.Personally,I think that other philosophical books cannot hold a candle to this magnificent book.It is not a drag as many people think.Read the book and you won't lose."
3,Expecting part 2,"Why does the author stop at Sartre? He is too brief withNietzshe who is so influential to contemporary philosophy,i.e. poststructuralism. I wonder how he will write about Roland Barthes, Michel Foucault or Jacques Derrida. I hope he will include all these contemporary philosopers in Sophie's World Part 2 - if he is going to write it."
5,Outstanding,"I really enjoyed the highly imaginative treatment Jostein Gaarder gave to a complex subject. I so very much liked how the plot moved the reader through Sophies introduction to the history of thought and its various evolutions thru out the ages.In reading this book one should control the temptation to speed through it as its ideas are cumlative. It has a deceptively simple allure to it. That the reader can easily be overwhelmed by as the history unfolds.I would highly recomend this to any student of the ""History of Philosphy"" as a fun and informative primer."
5,YOU NEED THIS BOOK...,"If you are at all interested in philosophy, or like myself a total layman when it comes to the topic, you NEED this outstanding book!It is written and explains the important history of philosophy so that even a young teenager can understand it.BUY IT!!!"
5,Should be read over and over,"I just finished reading the Turkish translation of the book and I'm planning to get couple of English versions to share with my friends.The book will help you question your life and move up ""the furs of the Rabbit"" letting you see at least part of the big picture.I would definetely recommend reading this book at different times of your life over and over again. Don't forget taking notes!"
5,The book that saved the day!,I looked everywhere for this book but was unable to find it anywhere else.Luckily I found it here and was very happy because I needed this book for a school assignment.Thank you so much!
1,A complete waste of time,"So, this is the book I have heard so many of my friends rave about. I read it, only to find out it is utterly uninteresting, flatly written and boring.I have a basic knowledge of all the great philosophers, and the subject itself is inifinitely fascinating. The only thinking Gaarder's book inspires, however, is how precious time is and what a pity it is to waste it reading books like this. There's so many great books out there, and people still claim this is a masterpiece. Get real!Maybe it works better for the absolutely uninitiated, but still there's better ways to approach the subject."
1,This Book is Mind-Numbingly Stupid.,"The plot is awful, the ""twist"" absolutely cliched, and, most importantly, the ""history of philosophy"" is abismal. Do NOT think you know ANYTHING about philosophy after reading this book. If you want to know about philosophy -- and not just be able to drop names -- GO READ PHILOSOPHY! You can do it. Its not dry, its not boring, and it can be done. If you don't want to actually learn about philosophy, don't pretend you do. And if you want to read a good novel, pick one that has a real plot, real characters, and real ideas. I suggest Italo Calvino -- he actually knows how to do magical realism. (And he probably understands Kant better too.)DO NOT give this book to anyone. Do not reccomend it. Do not read it. Its cliched, banal, and morally reprehensible."
1,"Very good book, but this CD is a poor recording","Sophie's World is a fine book, but this recording has a couple of mixed up tracks (tracks recorded correctly, but apparently put on the CD in reverse order) and one part where either the reader (Simon Vance) accidentally skipped a couple of paragraphs or, more likely the recording was accidentally cut. I sent a letter to Macmillan explaining the problem. They politely thanked me for the input; but, a year later, nothing has happened."
1,Boring,"the storyline on Sophie and Hilde was intriguing but the 10-page long discourses put me to sleep. the ending was stupid , also."
1,Utter crap!,"Cheap, boring and simplistic. The story never gets going, the treatment of the philosophers is as fun as a textbook on computer science."
1,I cant believe I finished this...,"Unlike other reviewers who dislike this, I read this of my own accord. I thought a novel might explain to me how a non-believer views the world rather then simply reading a list of rules in a biased text book.Unfortunatley I assumed the main chara would come to a conclusion of who created the universe. I suppose that would be too controversial. What a shame. I would rather people flame this book for simply disagreeing rather then boring them to death.This book does make it's point though, philosophy is alot of talk with no conclusion. You spent a LONG time learning only to find out it was all for naught, just like this book."
1,Mr. Leib sucks,Gabe thinks this book sucks because he has to read it over the summer for school. I'm hungry.
4,"you can find better, yet not a bad book","When I read this I had just finished reading The Solitaire Mystery, also by Jostein Gaarder, which is a much better book. Perhaps my expectations were to high....not the best read..."
5,A spoon fed course in philosophy,"You have to sit up to read Sophie's World. It needs your full attention, but it is a spoon fed course in philosophy and world history taught by a fine teacher with a great imagination! I read it twice"
5,Love to think? Enter Sophie's World,"What a joy. Ever person that love's a good book, Loves to think about ideas should read this book. Read it and give it to a friend. If you know a teenager give them Sophie's Worl"
2,maybe I can get some of my 7th grade essays published,"I can't NOT finish a book, so I trudged through this one. And when I got to page 285, I'm glad I did. The writing was mediocre at best, the characters pathetic. But Whoa! I won't give away what happens then, but what Gaarder does is brilliant! What an amazing way to illustrate the relationship between author, character and reader. That, in and of itself, could constitute a lengthy book."
2,Not very intellectual,"If you have prior knowledge to, and interest in philosophy, don't read this book. The short-stories in between the different philosophical presentations are like reading a paperback novel written for teenage girls, and the presentation of the different philosofical ideas is quite superficial.If you have a developed interest in philosophy, the book is crap. If all you want is an introduction, it might be useful if you are able to ignore the badly written story that sort of nits it all together."
4,So I think...,"Sophie's World is a facinating book with a twist in the tail, but only if you are interested in Philosophy. My dad couldn't get into it but I did! What does this say about our relationship!?!I love stuff like Philosophy and found this really good. There is also a surprise ending which I loved."
4,Good intro to philosophy,"I enjoyed the story of a young persons introduction to philosophy. As a novel, it lacks something. A perfect book for my 14 year old neice who is excited about learning and is preparing for college in a few years."
5,From J.S. The Economist:,"Mr Gaarder has written a marvellous piece of narrative fiction that has embedded within it the history of western philosophy. . . . The writing has clarity, an ease of style, and a way of presenting difficult ideas simply. Just occasionally an 'international bestseller' is not a tasteless confection of tripe and hype. 'Sophie's World' is such a book. It leaves you wondering a little at the world--rather in the way that children do."
5,Great Introduction to the History of Philosophy,"I found this to be a great overview of the history of philosophy. Although the storyline probably did help maintain my interest, this is not a great novel by any means. As a book on philosphy, it is probably not for someone who is already well versed in the subject. But for your average college level reader, and probably for an above average teen, this is a great introduction to philosphy."
2,"'Sophie' tries to do two tasks, and does neither well . . .","The problem with this book is that it tries to be 1) a novel, and 2) a history of philosophy.As a novel, it is one of the worst written pieces of prose i have ever encountered, contains flat, uninteresting characters, and no plot.As a histoy of philosophy, it gives brief, stereotyped introductions to complex, important thinkers.If you want a novel and a history of philosophy, but a novel AND a history of philosophy, not this book. If you are looking for an engaging (or even merely entertaining) read, this book is not where to find it, and I see no point in learning the barest facts about something as complex as philosophy, unless you are merely fishing for tid-bits to drop at parties.""A little learning is a dangerous thing / Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring / There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain / And drinking largely sobers us again."" - Alexander Pope."
4,Sophie's World,"Sophie's World can be a very rewarding book if enough time and thought is put into it. I found that it was a good introduction to philosophy, and was comprehensible without being patronising. It could almost be used as a philosophy textbook, but it is by no means boring. The book is divided up so that new philosophies are more digestible. The storyline is a clever way of occasionally putting newly learnt philosophies into practice. The only reason Sophie's World did not get five stars was that it sometimes became a little heavy- going. But for those who like a challenge, definately worth your while."
4,An easy-to-swallow history of philosophy couched in mystery.,"History of philosophy? What was I thinking when I bought this book?I put off reading it for several weeks--until I had no other unreadbooks to divert me.Finally I cracked the cover and began to read...and was hooked!From mystery to mysterious, this book turns and twists andtaught me about the history of philosophy in a very real way.What is real"
4,Beautiful Book,"This book offers a unique look into philosophy. It begin quire simplistically, with a young girl taking a correspondance course on philosophy. However, as time passes, her life becomes more and more surreal, leaving both her and the reader into a deep philophical mystery."
2,A page turner that you want to be finished with.,"Earlier this year, I was reading some assorted works of Plato. A lot of people give you a crazy eye when you read old philosophy outside of a college course (at least in my circles). Someone noticed what I was reading and recommended I pick up Sophie's World. A novel about philosophy sounds like a terrific idea. It's not really.I did enjoy the simplified descriptions of the history of philosophy as told to Sophie (and Hilde I suppose). This was beneficial but not thrilling.When it came to the story line, a lot is left to be desired. I finished the book of course, because it was good enough that you wanted to see what happened. I am not able to recommend this book."
1,Stilted artificial prose drags along mechanical summary,"As a philosophy graduate, I expected to give to my daughter an entertaining, lively discussion of the great philosophical ideas I had explored at university; but I was greatly disappointed to read painfully wooden prose artificially linking a series of letters (from a mysterious writer) summarizing the history of western philosophy for the edification of a young girl who, in my opinion, couldn't possibly understand most of the material.As a novel, the book is a disaster; as a summary of western philosophy, it is adequate, but I would recommend Father Copplestone's far more academic explorations of the same material. My sixteen-year old daughter, incidentally, agrees with my appraisal."
2,Great book for anyone under 16,"This book came highly recommended from some friends as a good read, but I need to find some new friends. I thought it the plot lacked any intensity or interest, the characters were weak, underdeveloped, and the language bored me to tears. This is a good book for young readers as an introduction to philosopy, but not if you're looking for a good read."
2,Many errors. Much tendentious.,"Sophie's World seens a great book for those who understand nothing about philosophy. There are many mistakes in it. E.g.:Jostein Gaarder shows Hume as a radical sceptic. But, in truth, Hume is an empiricist that do a sceptical inquiry to determine the frontiers of human's knowledge.And it's much tendentious. What can I say about a book that pretend to show the History of Philosophy and has a lot of pages talking about Jesus Christ and only one paragraph about Nietzsche, the greatest christianism critic?"
1,BORING!!!,The book was not interesting. I could not get into the character and why an adult would be sending a 14 year old notes.
4,"intresting, compelling and fun","This book was very intresting and I just wanted to keep reading. I didnt think i could learn that much information from one book.It really gives you a bases of understanding of philosophy. With intresting analogys continuing mysterys and people always letting things ""slip"" it keeps you reading. They only thing i was dissapointed with was the ending. It seemed cut short and unfinished."
1,"A Great Album, but there's something missing from this editi","Seventh Sojourn is an excellent album. The content itself gets five stars. The sound quality gets only one star. Compared to this album on vinyl, the sound quality lacks depth. I have compared it to the vinyl album and the vinyl has more depth to it despite all the snap, crackle and pop.I'm particularly disappointed since they did such an excellent job of ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED versions of Days of Future Passed and To Our Children's Children's Children."
5,Their Best Album,"If you ever want to try out a album by The Moody Blues. Get this one, this is & forever will be the best album ever released by the band. If you want to go one step further, get the SACD version containing bonus tracks. Every track is a classic. Search Judemac Forever on msn"
5,timeless,"This album is timeless. Classic music that will never fade. My favorites are ""isn't life strange"" and ""for my lady"". The entire cd is great music and classic Moody Blues."
4,Classic Moodies,"I purchased this CD after seeing the Moody Blues in concert, Count Basie Theater, Red Bank, NJ in March 2010.I have all the Moody Blues albums on vinyl, so I was very impressed with the quality after the re-mastering. Nice to hear some great old music once again. Really miss Mike Pinder as a member of the group - he added a lot of soul and depth."
5,music from my childhood,I grew up listening to the Moody Blues. All these songs sound just as tender and meaningfull today as they did 30 years ago!M. Yoga Dasi
5,A STAGGERING MASTERPIECE OF SYMPHONIC ROCK,"Perhaps the most accessible MB recording may also be their finest moment. Isn't life strange in that ""I'm Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band)"" was the only chart tune from this recording? It might be the weakest effort here. At sun-up, or sun-down, this mental excursion epitomizes what classic rock was all about. Caveat! At times it replays endlessly in one's mind. Lovely."
4,Classic Moody Blues,"This is classic Moody Blues at its best wtih well written and performed songs that stand the test of time. Though this album is 40 years old, the songs are every bit as relevant today as they were in the early 70's."
2,seventh blunder,"I have the misfortune of owning a ""BMG Direct Marketing"" edition of this CD, and it sounds like it was ripped from an old 1972 record. So the sound quality might be ruining my impression of this album. It is hard to hear the vocals amidst the over-busy instrumental mix, and when the lyrics can be distinguished, they are a meandering stream-of-conscious mess, perhaps drug-induced. There are many timeless classics from 1972, but this album just sounds old and dated. Do not recommend.I'm a little curious about the newer re-masterings with more tracks. Maybe they sound a lot better."
4,Deep...but in a wonderful way,"Most people's main observation about this album is how sad sounding it is, and the Moodie's own bad feelings during that time have been well documented. However, once you get past that, it really is a wonderful part of the Moody Blues story. Yes, songs like New Horizons and Isn't Life Strange are very sad, there are a few very happy and optimistic moments on the album, namely Land Of Make Believe and You and Me. The Moodies never could be totally negative, and this album proves that. And Ray, God bless him, as he so often does brightens things up marvelously with For My Lady. Although it is one of the most introspective of the classic seven, it is also one of the best."
3,7th sojourn review,"Definitely not even near their best- Can't touch the first 6. I agree it's sad to listen to because we know they'll never be the same. Pinder's 2 songs and Hayward's 2 are very good, but the rest are throwaways. What makes Moodies music so great is the feeling their songs elicit, and for my it's just not there on this one. ISOLC and AQOB are great, and their two best by far, the others very good, this one just good-the 7th best of the classic 7."
4,Very solid,"The Moody Blues represent what is mostly missing from today's music: heartfelt lyrics and songs with meaning. It's very nice how the songs on Seventh Sojourn flow together, not unlike most of the other Moody Blues albums. I'm Just A Singer In A Rock And Roll Band is a song that might still get airplay here and there - it was (still is) a wonderful hit song."
4,LOST IN A LOST WORLD,"THE THING ABOUT THE MOODY BLUES IS THAT THEIR MUSIC WAS JUST SO DAMN MELODIC, IF NOTHING ELSE. THAT'S WHY THEY WERE ALWAYS ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO. THIS ALBUM WAS THE LAST OF THEIR ORIGINAL SEVEN ALBUMS, RECORDED BETWEEN 1967-72, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE BEST AND MOST ORIGNAL PHASE OF THEIR RECORDINGS. I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, AND HAVE LISTENED TO IT A LOT OVER THE YEARS. THEY WERE DIFFERENT FROM MOST OF THE OTHER BRITISH ROCK BANDS THAT WERE AROUND AT THE TIME, NOT BETTER, BUT DIFFERENT."

5,Old-style vocals accompany sparse &precise acoustic styles,"t's amazing how much the guitar took over African music during the 1920s, 30s, 40s and 50s: traditional African instrumentations were disappearing and the guitar was 'king' and at its height in the 1950s.The old-style vocals accompany sparse and precise acoustic styling in FORGOTTEN GUITARS, especially recommended for collectors of historic field recordings or enthusiasts of old-style African music."
5,Wonderful!,"A sparkling and delightful gem of a book about the social life of Belle Epoque France. If you're a fan of Proust, or of this gorgeous, sumptuous era in itself, Skinner's book is a must-have. Covering the salons of Paris, some famous actors and actresses, Belle Epoque Paris and the world of the courtesans, to name a few subjects, this is an almost incomparable peek into the 1890s and 1900s."
2,too flimsy to work,"I thought all the many stencil pichures would make a great addition to my daughters craft stuff, but they are just too flimsy. The light weight pieces come up and paint goes under them. Plus they tear incredibly easy. I wish somebody would make the same pictures with better material so they could really be used."
4,Affordable creative fun!,"Can be put to very creative uses, and generates endless fun with toddlers and preschoolers. Only negative is that it is hard to color or cut the images out due to too many small corners and parts."
3,For hard-core fans only,"A collection of traditional Japanese vocal & instrumental music; if you're looking for flashy ethnic background music, this isn't your CD."
4,Give it a try,"It took me several readings to get into the flow of the book and the messages it contained but it was worth the effort. I always try and introduce myself to different points of view and ways of thinking. This book was accomplished that goal and more, it helped stretch me. I recommend it."
2,Very hard to understand ...,"""What it is can be a bit slippery, though."" I'll say. I think of myself as fairly intelligent (I'm a software developer, a Mensan, etc.), but this book was beyond me. It was trouble from the first page, but I read into the 9th chapter before setting it aside. For me, a large problem is the style of writing. He takes a long time and uses many words and at the end of the chapter, I say to myself - ""What was that about?"" or ""What was his point?"". It could be a East meets West thing. I admit that he may just be too brilliant or insightful or radical in thinking for me."
1,Mixed feelings,"I recievedmy cover and was shocked that it did not include the bows, the product itself looked to be of good quality but as it was described 54 inches tall threw me to thinking it was a complete unit, I returned it and got part of my money back, lesson learned be sure to write and ask before purchase."
1,I never received the frame for the bimini.,"I received the cover for the bimini but have not received the frame. Placed the order on May 10, 2011."
3,belva burns,Three stars is all this Eden Burning Deserves. Not bad but not up to the usual Belva standards. Maybe next time.A faithful reader awaits!Belva's getting boring. Think I'll switch to Sandra Brown.
1,Blurry,"I bought this book thinking I would get a good understanding of Java programming with Oracle. I was wrong. This book, like amny other Wrox books, has too many authors who duplicate the same material in different parts of the book. I didn't think coverage was adequate in any of the areas claimed to be covered.Save you money and buy books that cover JDBC and PL/SQL separately. At least you'll get something worthwhile that way."
1,Attempts to cover too much material and fails,I didn't think much of this book at all. It seemed like a random collection of essays that were quickly thrown together. I would avoid this book and buy a more focused one instead. You'd be better off buying separate books on PL/SQL and JDBC instead.
1,Too little detail,This book doesn't get into enough detail on the various topics it claims to cover.
4,Armada finally,"I am rather pleased with this set, my only gripe is the way the DVD is set up in its cases. I find it a little confusing.All and all Armada is good, but I am looking forward to the second half of this series.My favourite Episode of this set is Rebellion."
4,Even good for teens,"First of all, I would like to state that I grew up watching Transformers, from the end of the G2 series until Cybertron, so my review may be a bit biased. Transformers Armada and Energon I'm afraid I missed seeing as they came out, but having recently bought this set, I was able to catch myself up somewhat. In defiance to many other reviews, the animation was fairly well done, as well as the voice casting. The new voice actor for Starscream was a good fit for the character. And while I do have to say that I have missed a few of my old favorite characters, I haven't yet seen a huge problem with those returning. All in all, except for a few times when the kids got extremely annoying, and the dialouge a little repetitive, this was a very good series, and I would give it a 4.75 but that number isn't selectable. And now I shall wait rather impatiently for the second half of the series to come out in a collection available in America."
5,Does it get any better than this?...... No.,The 69 Eyes are a mind-blowing Finnish rock band! This is a compilation of some of their best songs and worth every penny! They remind me of an updated version of The Cure and yet they're like nothing else I've ever heard! They are my favorite band! Amazing vocals and music
3,"Pretty good, but stretches the concept a little too much...","There are some really cute things in here, and I know I'll be knitting the cupcakes and some of the small bags. But I was a little annoyed by the inclusion of the tank top - sure, it only takes one skein - but it's a 1250 yard skein and the sizing only goes up to a 36-inch bust. Overall, though, pretty good and worth getting."
3,Great photos....otherwise disappointing,"I was so pleased with the beautiful pictures in this book.....then disappointed because most of the patterns are for knitting, not crochet. The crocheted bath mat looked like great fun, but soon I realized it would take way more than one skein of yarn......This book would make a nice gift book because of the photos.....but not that useful, especially if you crochet instead of knit."
2,"Crochet? Yeah, right",I guess I should have read the review and I would have realized that this was really a knitting book. Some cute projects - if you're a knitter. Will have to try to figure out how to convert some of the cuter projects to crochet.
5,Great book,This is a great resource book for knitters who have to have one skein of each kind of yarn. I also think that the service was great.
5,Love this Book,This book has lovely photos and great instructions.A great way to use up the lonely skein of yarn sitting in your stash! I'd recommend this book to any knitter.
3,Misleading,I am not sure that these patterns are for one skein of yarn. Many of them call for many different colors not one skein.
3,"ok, not great","This is a great concept for a quit-knit, type of book, but I found some of the projects were a bit quirky; I don't know many people who use fingerless gloves or leg-warmers any more. Otherwise, this was a nice book, and perhaps something to keep yourself occupied with. I wouldn't really use this as a gift-giving resource."
1,A waste of good money,This book was a terrible disappointment. I was hoping for better designs that would be little more appropriate for me. I am 60 years old and I don't see me wearing leg warmers or fingerless gloves. What a big waste of money!
4,Love the knitted bowls,I bought this book just for the knitted bowls and it did not disappoint. I have made about 7 of the bowls and given a few away as gifts. The recipients were delighted with the unique gift and raved that I made them something. Many of the projects are very fast and easy. The quick little felted purse was also fun to make. Buy this book for yourself or a friend as a fun treat.
3,Worth looking at.,It's a decent book. It's probably half and half quality wise. Half are cute other half I'd never ever knit.
1,Really misleading,"The title of this book is completely misleading. It implies that there are about an equal amount of knitting and crocheting patterns in this book, what a joke. There are maybe 4 or 5 crochet patterns in this book total, everything else is knitting. And the crochet patterns that are there aren't that impressive. This book does absolutely nothing for a crocheter. They should call this book: ""One Skein: A whole bunch of knitting patterns with a few crochet patterns thrown in for show"". 1 star"
4,Comprehensive and varied,"As a beginner knitter, I am very interested in books that feature quick and easy projects that give me a sense of accomplishment. I borrowed this book for the library and it looked very promising, enough for me to get my own copy. Like Two Balls or Less, there are some crochet projects included, a plus for me.The color pictures are delightful and the instuctions appear to be easy to understand.The projects are varied: some baby items, some home/decorative accesories, some traditonal knit items (hat/scarf/gloves), and some accesories (clutches, totes). There are some felting projects, which I have yet to try, but am anxious.As many reviewers pointed out the cupcakes are darling. This is my next project.Be sure to look at the images of what other reviewers have created! They are loveley and inspiring...can't wait to try my own.I recommed this book for its comprehensive variety of items to create."
4,A Great Book!,"Overall, I thought this book was great!The Good:- easy to read format- beautiful pictures- nice techniques description in the backThe Bad:- only 3 or 4 crochet projects- they aren't exactly ""geared for the beginner""--I found some of the designs a little too complex and needed to consult another book for help- some of the yarns used are hard-to-find, not reasonably pricedOverall, I would definitely recommend this book!"
1,I returned the book,"This book has nothing in it that appealed to me. I was very excited, considering all the reviews, but found it to be quite a let down. I sent it back. One Skein Wonders by Judith Durant beats this book hands down!!"
4,Cute and Quick,"A fun selection of items that are great for using up an odd skein or taking along for a short trip. Instructions are clear and the projects can be made in a few hours to over a weekend. Several hats, baby items, scarves, gloves, purses, etc...a nice, varied collection of patterns for both knitting and crochet.I'm an intermediate-level knitter with more ideas than time. I found the projects in this book to be just right (i.e., they're easy to complete)."
4,Great little book,This book is great for using just one skein of yarn and for completing small projects quickly. There is something for everyone.
4,Want to try something new?,"If you want to try a new stitch or use up the lone skeins in your stash, this is a good book to own. From leg warmers to pillows, bibs to scarves there is a lot to try.These patterns let you learn new stitches and techniques without investing a ton of money and/or time. If you can't use the things you've made give them as gifts, donate them to shelters, or save them for the next craft fair."
5,I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN!,"Lots of nifty ideas for small (and some bigger) projects. Not a beginner how to book, but rather a great book for one who wants to broaden their knitting experience. So far, I have made the baby hat and plan to dive into the cable footies next. Lovely illustrations, easy instructions, great variety."
3,many of the best patterns aren't really one skien,"Tbe patterns are cute but the title is decpetive. there are several cute one skien patterns - but several patterns as have ben pointed out by others - require more than one skien.The cute tank top in the book -is WAY more than one skien. I didn't use the called for yarn - I substituted. 1st - it calls for 2 strands held together so already you need 2 balls of yarn. Then - it just takes more than one ball. I'm not eve 1/2 way through the top and I've used up most of the 2 balls I held togehter. Good think I actally had more than one skien of this yarn. And the rug and baby sweater...multiple skeins.Still, this and other patterns are cute."
1,A dissenting voice,"Clear instructions and great pictures, but do you really want to, or need to, knit a bath puff or yarn cupcakes? I was hopeful the other 28 patterns might prove useful, but I'm not convinced legwarmers are back in style or that any man I know would wear the ""gaiter"" and oddly short ""triple cable muffler"" pictured on pages 36 & 37. I returned the book. Don't buy ""One-Skein Wonders"" either."
1,Knit AND Crochet? Not Quite ...,"I counted 3 crochet projects.One day I will learn that when books have the words ""Knit and Crochet"" in their titles, that usually means ""95% of the projects are knit, and 5% are crochet."" Worse yet, it usually means ""all of these are knitting projects, and we succumb to using crochet techniques only to make frilly edgings."""
2,Nothing special,"I've had this a while, and drag it out every now and again. It's a very pretty book, but a bit of a waste of precious shelf space. There's very little crochet, notwithstanding the title. And most of the patterns are for hats, gloves, scarves - the most obvious contenders for single skeins. I'm not crazy over the skimpy little scarves. And some patterns are ridiculous. Like the cupcakes. What on earth is one supposed to do with knitted cupcakes? If anyone had to gift me with something like that, I would be put off them for life. Useless little dust collectors.... The one skein tank is another joke - it takes a skein of laceweight with thousands of yards of yarn. Hello? If I buy a skein of laceweight, I don't need a stash busting book - it's enough for a shawl.Anyway, if you are still a bit of a beginner, this might be useful. If you have a few knitting books, know how to surf the net, and have half an ounce of imagination, you don't need this book."
5,Excellent book to start talking spanish right away,Explains in an easy and detailed way how to make a communication with a non English speaker. It uses phonetics to learn the Spanish pronunciation; just great.
4,Very different set,"This is a good book series. Different, but I like to read different things...gets you thinking in different ways! I would recommend this series to anyone!"
4,Clever,"I enjoyed this book even better than the first one in this series. Very interesting, complex characters."
2,"A hoax, but otherwise well written piece of Science Fiction","I started reading this book under the assumption that it was an actual Soviet text. However, the more I got into it, the more suspicious I became that it surely can't be real. That's when I did a little google search ""Soviet Brainwashing textbook a hoax"" and discovered a lot of evidence that this is not only a hoax, but a cleverly veiled Scientologist attack on Psychology.As a piece of science fiction, it is very gripping, disturbing and even Orwellian. I would only recommend this book as fiction and a peek inside what could be behind Scientology's own brainwashing techniques."
2,A rip-off of a rip-off of a Hoax. Now that's scholarship!,"This ""secret Russian textbook"" was popularized by Kenneth Goff, who put his name on the not copyrighted anonymous booklet. It was originally written, as a ""mysterious"" propaganda booklet, to smear psychiatry. And by none other than the wacky L. Ron Hubbard himself. Do a google search! This is about the fifth or sixth version, with yet another new Introduction. Goff insisted it was written, in Russia, during the 1930s, yet it mentions 'Dianetics', and features other Scientology lingo. (Those Russian spies must have been busy, and had a time machine too!) Edward Hunter, author of the credible and real 1951 text, 'Brain-Washing in Red China', called 'Brainwashing: A Synthesis of the Russian Textbook on Psychopolitics' a HOAX! And it is. Wake up and smell the coffee!"
5,Love this bag!,Another great product from Topeak. Fits great on my new MTB29r even with the bigger wheels. I needed this shape due to frame wheel size and it works great. Good construction and fits my lock and tire patch gear nicely. Straps securely to bike seat and detaches easily if you want to take with you or just put on another bike.
5,Replacing a smaller bag,Install was easy and the wife likes the extra room for stoying things. Seems to be as nice of quallity as the one we bought from a near buy bike shop. A lot less money too.
4,Strap on back intended for tail light too small for my tail lights.,"Pros: Large enough for medium-to-small first aid kit, spare tube, rudimentary bike tools, wallet, keys, a few personal items. Once configured, it's tightly bound to seat and won't shift. Extra storage is available by expanding w/zipper.Cons: Strap on back very small for my tail lights' brackets: Overly tiny with hardly any stretch. Virtually always, one needs to attach such lights to the seat bag if the seat post is not out far enough (or they may use a saddle incorporating a tail light). I wonder if this is usable for any tail light models: Whyyyyy?! Hard and tedious to get main attaching strap for seat ""configured"" well for certain seats, yet not impossible: Somewhat short....Purchased as replacement for medium Avenir bag that was too small. May try ""modding"" by sewing cut section of a larger aftermarket strap to back...."
4,Great Bag,I brought this velcro wedge pack for my husband who is a cyclist. This bag replaced another bag with had a clip and broke. The bag seems to be more secure.
2,"Almost comically big, won't fit comfort saddles","If you have a comfort saddle, this wedge won't fit. The dimensions (that were not in the listing): 5"" wide, 6"" tall and 9.5"" deep."
3,Very large,"This is a bit tricky to review. The bag is as described, and other reviewers have done a good job describing it. It's a good-quality bag.The problem for me was that until I put it on my bike, it was hard to know if it was right for me. For me, the width at the base is too much. It's 1 - 1.5 inches wider than other large-ish bags, and that dimension really matters. I found that each thigh was hitting the bag with each pedal. I'm a normal-size person on a normal road bike. So the bottom line for me was that this bag doesn't work for me. There are other large-capacity bags that taper at the base, so I'll look at those for a better option."
4,Bag is too wide for bikes with narrow seats.,Topeak Aero Wedge Pack with Velcro (Large)Product seems to be of very good quality but not usable on either of my bikes. (Trek 1.5 and Trek FX 7.2) The bag is too wide and my legs hit the bag while pedaling. The problem is worse on the road bike. If you ride a hybrid or something with a wide seat I would have no problem recommending this bag.
2,Bag is too wide,"The quality of the bag is fine and so is the zipper that is used to close it. Holds cell phone, tube, tools and more with no problem. This issue that I have is that the bag isn't tapped narrow enough so that when I slide back on the saddle, the width of the bag is wider than my seat, thus my legs end up rubbing the bag, which is annoying/distracting when climbing hills. I'll going to keep the bag, but replace it with something that is the width of the seat."
2,"not a handbook,","From the title of this book I expected a coherent, step by step guide to track days. What you get instead is a personal journal of his riding experiences with some VERY BASIC, guide to track days. This book is only for the true beginning rider, anyone with any experience will find little new or useful."
1,Sent me the wrong product!,"I ordered a Zen garden for a gift exchange. It was supposed to be 11.5"" by 7"". What I got was a tiny little 4 inch box. Amazon is express shipping me a different zen garden but I don't know if it will arrive in time. I am very unhappy with the delivery! The new one I ordered is identical but will cost me 3 dollars more along with possibly being too late for my gift exchange. I am unhappy with this. Amazon was great at doing all they could but this company could have done a lot better in inventory control!"
2,Not deep enough.,"I use this in my office with elementary children, who are all immediately attracted to its sand and rakes. Unfortunately, it's not very deep and so the sand is constantly coming up out of the box. I've left the base in the cardboard box it came in just to try to contain some of the sand but in general I've been discouraging the kids from using it because of the mess it leaves behind. If it were just a bit deeper it would be a great product."
4,"Mini Zen Garden, dimensions","This miniature zen garden is a reasonable product at a reasonable price (< $20). However, the amazon.com description fails to provide the dimensions which are: 11.5"" long x 7"" wide x 1"" high (on very short legs). It come with a bag of fine white sand, 5 small stones, & two small rakes. Individuals have a difficult time keeping themselves away from the rakes to create their own design in the garden sand."
1,Don't waste your money!.,"The so called ""zen garden"" is the size of a postage stamp and the miniatures barely fit inside the tray. Very disappointing!"
5,Complete guide to exellent,Joe Theismann a former Q.B for Notre Dame and Washington Redskins and now a espn commentator knows everything about football. He uses his skills in football and writes about it. He talks about everything from what a touchdown is to five parts of coverage. This book is exellent for idiots all the way to heisman.
3,"It's good for non-beginners, but a little trite","I agree with the previous rec - i bought it and enjoy it even though I already know and love the game. it has a lot of historical, anecdotal information about the game.Mr. Theisman's humor and ego, however, get old quick. The problem with the book is that HE treats you like an ""idiot"" and he never misses an opportunity to talk about his awesome intelligence and capabilities and Superbowl championship."
2,Save your money on this one: PASS IT UP !,"Duh, He talks to you like you've had a concussion.This book seems OK at first, but after reading through the first few pages I discover how immature Thiessman's writing is. Half the time he either talks to you like a three-year-old or like your an NFL Play Coordinator.It does explain some misconceptions but for the most part is either insultingly stupid or flatulently complicated.""YARDLINES: These are the long white lines running accross the field with numbers on them.>>>>Thank you, Sherlock Holmes.""ENCROACHMENT: This penalty is defined when a member of the offensive line enters the neutral zone."">>>>What the hell is the neutral zone? There is no previous explanation.""To execute this play have the quarterback snap the ball watching for a blitz, and looking for an open wide reciever in the red zone, but prepare himself for a rush."" >>>>Huh? Can I get this in English?"
3,Nice surprise,"I didnt know that this record exist.It was an in teresting surprise and I bought it inmediatly.And in my opinion the average quality is high.There are things better than others.But I am glad I owe this recording.Beeing a professional harpsichordist,I love baroque music,and on the other side,I like the beatles.I knew Rifkin from other works.And,I am noit at all dissapointed with this record."
3,Good book for learning apache,This book has a lot of useful information and I have used it in part to build my own web server. It gives you a solid understanding of how Apache web server works and covers a lot of material.
1,Terrible,"This book was good for comparing apache 1.3 and apache 2.0, and that was the end of what helped. I am a programmer and a network administrator, and I am trying to intigrate FreeBSD and Apache into a windows environment. I am amazed by how much this book has overcomplicated simple things in apache. I paid about $22 for the book, and I have never been so disapointed."
4,Comprehensive,"Fisrt of all, covering all of Apache is quite a difficult task. Add to that the need for updated information keeping in pace with release timings. I think a good job has been done by Peter on this book. He has covered all that a System Admin needs to know in short space. Definitely recommended."
1,Save your money,I purchased the fin comb to remove the hail dents from my AC unit and it didn't work. Not able to adjust it to the size of the fins.
1,Air conditioner fin comb,I got this for my central air conditioner. It was completely worthless. The comb did not fit into the fins well and did nothing to straighten them.
4,The one to get,"The teeth are stainless steel and set right next to each with no spaces if the slide is all the way forward. Pull the slide back and the teeth accomodate various fin spacings. Because the teeth are steel, not plastic, I recommend this tool over most of the other ones I've seen available on line. Don't expect it to do the impossible (straighten an area that badly bent) and you'll like it too."
4,Works as designed,"I have an 'near"" identical item from Home Depot. I read the directions, and found it works if you get the teeth of the comb into a section of good fins just above or below the dent and start combing towards the damage. It works easiest on fins that are just pressed together rather than those that are seriously bent over. The directions I have also show you and slip them behind the dented fins and using it as a lever (use something as a brace that won't damage the fins - a wooden ruler works) pull out the worse dents - I found that does work with some patience. I also found on mine that I pull the adjustment collar all the way back allowing the teeth of the comb spread out to find their 'proper' place inside a good section of the fins before combing towards the damaged section.Also search youtube for Condenser Fin Comb Training The video shows a different tool you might want to try.Hope this helps those who are finding it a challenge."
1,Air Conditioner Fin Comb,I bought this product in order to fix the fins on my air conditioner. It simply doesn't work. No way could myself and others figure out how to use this tool. The more we tried the worse the fins on our air conditioners got. Don't waste your money. The company it's self told me via email that the fins are very thin and hard to work with. That's why I bought their tool.
3,"Moore or less, try to get dark eros","Thomas ponders some pretty interesting stuff here, like a history teacher lamenting how things are just not as sexy as they used to be.. though some good points, it lacks the bite of his now out of pub, Dark Eros, but could i suppose be a fitting companion to it. Moore is a lovely author, but seems to suffer in the shadow of his mentor, who had the punch I wish he could put out there. For a good conservative liberal christian view, this is the best i've found on the subject matter in a compassionate way.. I wish he woudl still get dirty though like in Dark.. maybe he's just not a young man anymore"
3,my children simply did not like it,"While this book was Honoured by The Children's Book Council of Australia, my children simply did not like it. After one reading the refused to listen to it again. They explained to me `the idea of a man with a bird's nest on his head' is stupid. The premise of the book is Colin Jenkins falls asleep under a tree, while a rare bird builds a nest on his head. Rather than remove the nest from his head, he loses friends, his job and his home, and one day the birds simply fly away, never to be seen again. The Jenkins family, is left with a birds nest, which they lay beside the window sill and `from time to time he would find the most beautiful and improbable things...'. While my kids did not find the story amusing, they were fascinated by the illustrations, a combination of hand drawn sketches, colour and meaningful collage."
4,Great construction but smaller than you'd think,"I bought this liking the small size and thinking I could fit everything I normally carry - spare tube, tire lever, multi-tool, pressure gauge, CO2 tanks and inflator, and keys/license. When I received it I tried to fit everything and unfortunately was only able to get some of the items to fit. If you only carry the bare basics then it's perfect, but if you like to have a few things with you then get the medium size. I just bought the medium today and it's perfect, fits everything I carry with room to spare, plus it's expandable as well. I'm surprised they make a micro-sized one as well, medium size should be the smallest one they make, but if you dont carry much then this one can be perfect for you. Everything else about it is great, and like that I dont have to unstrap it to open it like some of the other ones."
4,Strap Strength will determine its value,"I got this to replace one (it was from another company) that I had for 8.5 years. So my standard for longevity is quite high. Compared to my previous one, this is much more aero, thinner and longer. That is both good and bad, as this one pushes my taillight down so that it no longer points directly behind me, but now also points down some too. Not a huge deal, but another reason to go smaller if you can. Otherwise, it is a nicer ""fit"" under the seat.The key is what you can pack into the 40 cubic incher. In my case, here is what I have (and it barely fits): one tube, 2 tire irons, a multitool, and an Altoids tin (I keep $, patches, glue, tire boot, and a few other small items in there). That's it, and it is full. However, that is everything I need. If you need more, go larger.This version uses straps to ""hang"" on the seat rails. The straps on this one are a bit thinner than my old pack. It remains to be seen if they will hold up for 8 years."
4,Does the job.,"This has plenty of room for a tube, tire levers, Co2 and gerber with room to spare. It fits nicely under the bike seat."
5,Great bag,"The small is not too small. It is perfect for my Cannondale Rize and holds all my gear well. I have never had an issue with moisture inside the bag. I ride throughout the year in New England, so the bag sees lots of mud/snow/water/dirt. It is a GREAT bag and I would buy another if I ever had the need. i don't see this bag wearing out any time soon."
2,Doesnt fit my Tri bike,"Fit my road bike, but it doesnt fit my TRI back as my seat stem is bigger. Good for road bikes though"
4,"Nice pack, questionable for MTB","Nice pack materials and construction. I put in a small tool kit (9), patch kit, mtb tube, 2 co2, 1 tire lever; Just fit, no more room.If you notice this pack curves down and has a large opening. Large opening is good but. When you cinch the pack up the rear is right of the seat. If you mtb and like to get of the back, it will be in the way."
1,Too small for almost anything....review are for medium size not small,This bag is small small small.But my real problem is that the reviews ( almost all of the 46 ) are for the medium size. I guess I could have noticed when I bought it. But why would Amazon put all the the Medium size bag reviews under the Small bag page?
3,"ok, but...","for my set-up, it blocks the rear reflector on seat pole. It can hold my wallet, cell phone and keys, just barely... Good construction; the velcro option is convenient and allows for multiple mount options... I mount mine upside down attached to bike rack. That picture is not the velcro option."
3,A Play by James Baldwin,"I think The Amen Corner is a good play, because it's about everyday people. I think every family can relate to the family in Balwin's 1964 Broadway Hit--The Amen Corner. Many people have drinking problems of some sort. Additionally, many people can relate to the hardships of losing someone you love. Reading this play may help you focus on a relationship with God."
1,worthless,This is a worthless video for any college footbal fan.I watched this video once and then threw it away!
5,Great All-Round Reference,"It's short (okay, for an advanced computer book it's short, it will still work as a boat anchor), it's clear, and it's complete. The beginner may head toward something that says ""learn SQL Server in X Days,"" but the real beginner will need the details listed in this book. An error number table, a data type interaction table... how can you live without it!"
4,Almost Perfect,"I purchased this book for some issues on my current project, mostly stored procedure and trigger problems. I was pleased with the authors theory on triggers, but disappointed on his How To approach. The book talked about using the Northwind trigger example, but did not show how to create one from the begining. I will admit I am new to SQL and maybe I needed more of an entry level book. I used Books Online within SQL to answer my question about triggers. Books Online did an excellent job explaining how to use and manage triggers with the Enterprise Manager. I must admit this is the only area the book is lacking, it helped me with many other issues. I have always recommended Wrox and will continue to, but I am disappointed a little on this title."
5,Best book on SQL Server Ever!,"This is a fantastic book. Robert Vieria is a hero. The book has helped me in my work, helped me pass my MCP and very often also made me laugh out loud..... A programming book with a sense of humor....."
1,Out of date,"After all the ballyhoo on this book, I went and bought it. Frankly, I'm disappointed. Were there pages missing or did old Rob forget about T-SQL error handling? With SQL Server 2000 on the street much of what you see here is old hat. Current books cover SQL 2000. This one doesn't. For a guy that apparently spends more times in newsgroups than he does with the product, the self-important style is inappropriate. Go and earn your stripes, Rob."
3,Not quite in depth enough for me. Not for advanced users!,"This book is more of an intermediate level book. Good well written sections, with clear explanations. However I was expecting a book aimed more at programmers as opposed to a book which merely explains the funamentals of SQL Server 7. Most of the sections seem like re-worded help files. I conceed that these section are much better than help file, there are too many important areas (to me anyway)overlooked. Like for example Store Procedures and the OLAP section could be deduced by simply reading the help in the OLAP wizards. I guess this book is good if you need conceptual information about the SQL language and TSQL. Not for advanced users."
1,Credible?,"A book about media credibility, written by a columnist from National Enquierer. What's wrong with this picture?"
1,Not liked at all,"It is not a very good phone. The only plus it has going for it is the large numbers for those who have a hard time seeing to dial. The LCD or what ever its called does not light up to see the numbers or who is calling. Gray background with black letters are very hard to see. Also, had a problem with brushing cheek against the talk button and disconnecting those I was talking to. Sorry, this thing is a -10 in my books and it is getting returned."
5,AN UNDERESTIMATED MASTERPIECE,"Deep Purple's 3rd album,bearing their own name,is certainly an underestimated masterpiece,as all the albums by the,unfortunately ignored by many,mark1. Jon Lord has a more leading role than in the following albums and so there is a great influence by classic music.April is a fine mixture of classic music and rock'n'roll,the best song in the album and one of my favourite purple tunes.Also songs as Blind,Lalena,Chasing Shadows and The Bird Has Flown are at least as good as many mark2 and mark3 great hits.To sum up:don't be affected by some superficial critics(I wonder if this guy listened to the record more than once)and buy this excellent album!"
2,Dull. Boring,"I tried to read it, I really did. I wanted to like it. But it just didn't make it for me. Too dull."
5,A pleasure to read over and over.,"I first read the Williamsburg Novels when I was a senior in high school in El Dorado Springs, Missouri. My history teacher suggested that I read the books and I have read them all at least 5 times since 1968. In 1978 I purchased the novels and treasure them! History and loving family relationships from the Revolutionary War through WWII. Thanks Mrs. Elliott for getting me started!"
4,Interesting Concept,"Heard this story as a radio storyline on one of the Old Time Radio internet channels, and felt compelled to read the original. Not disappointed, though I think the plot would be more extreme if re-written from today's perspective of change of society and evolution over time."
2,Check the vintage before reading,This read felt like it is - a book written in the 50's.The midcentury view of the future and the political nonsense imagined is boring
2,First published 1951 not 2011,"I wish they would tell you when the book was first published, it was not 2011. Maybe that's when they made the electronic edition. I do occasionally read older books but this one is horribly outdated. The style is a 1950 style which I find somewhat boring. Was hoping for something a bit more current. Horribly xenophobic. Sorry, would feel badly for the author but he died in 1977."
2,Sentimentality,I bought the book because I remembered it. It is so OBE it has ceased to be interesting.I stopped reading it in the middle.Leon
3,Not Bad,"I felt as though I had seen this on Outer Limits years ago. It was OK, but somewhat familier in its story."
4,Still pertinant,60 years and the work remains a testament to great writing over mere technobabel. Change a few facts unknown at the time and this story fits right into present day genre.
3,Solid SF tale.,"A solid science fiction effort. Certainly no classic, but generally well written and interesting. The story unfolds nicely as the residents of a small city try to find out why the world around them has changed so much (and why they are still alive!) after a nuclear bomb hits their town. City at World's End is 1950's science fiction and not for all taste. It will probably be enjoyed most by those who enjoy Ray Bradbury or the original Star Trek TV series."
4,Reading Back In Time,"The thing about going back and reading old SciFi is to keep in mind that this was the beginning of the modern genre and you have to keep your expectations at a reasonable level. Hamilton, like many authors of this era, had abiding faith in technology, a lack of understanding of the basics of ecology, and a generalized belief that all government was, in the end, incompetent at best, venal at the worst. Of these the last remains a worthy theme of SciFi.This book is highly recommended as a good, short SciFi novel with a very interesting story. The other reason is that for Kindle readers you can get it for free, or close to it! Hard to pass that deal up."
4,4 reviews at CITY AT WORLD'S END (Del Rey Books (Paperback)),4 reviews of this book are found at the entry: CITY AT WORLD'S END (Del Rey Books (Paperback))
4,Entertaining Kindle read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Well written, with an entertaining plot and interesting characters! Also had good formatting for the Kindle! (I purchased the $.80 edition.)"
1,Slogged through half then threw in the towel,"I liked the beginning of this book. I was hoping for another Alas Babylon or Earth Abides. Nope. I never really believed it, not a word. It's just a tame little story where NOTHING EVER HAPPENS!Put the guns in the jeep for our trek over the far future wasteland because who knows what's out there. NOTHING is out there. Yawn.Let's look inside this far future abandoned city to see what lurks there. NOTHING lurks there.Lets meet the menacing aliens and see what happens. NOTHING happens. They're nice.Really, not kidding. It's that much of a snoozer."
1,Not for the beginner,"This is definately a advanced video. If you want to see a instructor play much faster than you can, enjoy."
4,the best in its price,it is a well designed atlas...fullfills the demands of any one who wants to work in the field of furniture or who wants to design his own home perfectly....but i think it was gonna be better if this atlas focused on the styles much more .
5,"an inspiring, and revealing tale told by 2 great Americans","When I was in college I had the very good fortune to attend several ""An Evening with Ossie and Ruby"" presentations on campus. These were a series of selected readings which Mr Davis and Ms Dee presented with honesty, skill and emotion. I became a fan at the first session. THey are people of talent, integrity, and human compassion.As a rule I do not read biographies but I had to read this book! and I am ever so glad I did.these are two people who broke barriers and reached new heights thus changing and improving both our culture and our arts. Their talent, commitment and perserverance is inspiring and reminds us that there are no small players in this drama called life."
5,Truly inspiring!,"I love Ossie and Ruby. Their story is inspirational. They are true survivors. I loved hearing them tell their story in their own words. It was funny, touching and at times heart wrenching what they went through. They are true icons of not only African American history, but American history."
4,Warm & Honest,"Two completely different individuals, yet both on the same page. Respect, love, and most of all honestly will sustain all time. A great peek into the lives of a couple who have been through it all."
5,=),"Really great CD. Most of the remixes are really, REALLY good (not over the top, just a nice update of some great songs). I sought this CD out after hearing ""Midnight at the Oasis"" in of all places the local Melting Pot! Very satisfied with the album.# # #"
4,This CD!,"Yeah, the title says it all. Songs from the seventies remixed with todays sound. I'll tell you how good this CD is. There are songs that I have heard on AM stations that are on this CD and just made me cringe. I hear them on this CD and its like I can actually listen to them and enjoy that the lyrics actually do make sense. They put the best two songs at the beginning, ""Listen to the music"" and ""Summer breeze"". It does stay interesting throughout most of the CD. I would have given it 5 stars but they actually have a group that recorded the title song of this CD and it is not a remake and I can tell why. It is a bad song. The rest of the CD is hip and its a CD that the kids and the parents will enjoy together."
2,Lame...,"Yet another attempt to make money off of someone else's art. The songs aren't improved by putting a beat box track on top of them.If every song needs to sound like Timbaland got a hold of it, then this is the CD for you. Otherwise, leave it on the shelf."
4,Love it!!,"Some of my favourite artists and tracks have been given a ""new"" sound that does not destroy the image of the original.I bought this album for ""Summer Breeze"", but now that I have listened to it many times I am very happy with the whole album. Its great to hear Nicolette Larson again as well as George Benson."
5,One of the best games ever,"Although SMAC isn't for those with short attention spans, it is a spectacular game. There are 7 different factions, so well balanced that any of them can win by exploiting their respective advantages. Furthermore, you need not win through conquest. There are 5 different ways to win.This game is a truly brilliant turn based strategy game. Every fan of strategy games should own this."
3,I don't think this is as good as some others say,"I played all the other Civ like games and this is the type of game I like, but I just didn't get Alpha Centauri. I played this one enought to get good, but the whole feel was just too much like Civ II and I seemed to get into Civ II like end games too easily.Having now played CivIII for six months I given it a 5 start rating I don't understand my own review, but that was the feel I had.I guess if you can get it for $10 now then it should be worth a try.Maybe I'll try this again another day."
3,Conquor,"Well im not exactly sure why it takes these other people so long to beat this game. It has alott to do with your character, and the way you set your objectives. I often fight from the begening from start to end large map by myself on normal i can beat this game in under 4 hours with the remaning forces on the earth uniting behind me."
5,My first Cd-rom game.,"This being my first game (and without any info with it), it's great. I have had for about five months now and have completely defeated it with all factions and settings. If I could only find the expantion pack ""Alein Crossfire"". I have searched the net but no luck 'it's no longer avaliable'. May you faction be strong!"
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"This is not a book, it's a booklet of 33 pages! The tips are simplistic and obvious and can be gotten out of numerous other time management books that are better. I was completely disappointed and would have sent the book back to Amazon, but it's not worth paying the shipping to do so. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Cool costume but helmut poorly made,"My 7-yr old thought this costume was super cool but the helmut was poorly made. It is actually 2 pieces of cheap plastic that you have to put together. The helmut kept scratching against his forehead, making it red and irritated. This is very unfortunate because you can't be Megaman without the helmut. For the amount of money you have to pay for this childs' costume, you should be able to expect a better quality helmut."
2,loose lid,The ceramic is slightly cheap and the lid doesn't fit properly so it's kind of pointless because it is a travel mug! The cobalt blue is a nice colour. I bought another mug through Creative Ventures through Amazon and it was cheaper and the quality was much better.
4,Nice look but doesn't retain heat,The black cup is unique and eye catching but the lid is not airtight and therefore leaks and does not keep the liquids hot. I still think it looks cool!
2,disappointing - flimsy lid - pops off at bad times,"Mug is just okay. The lid is flimsy and has a tendency to pop out, not a good fit. This can be a real hassle if it happens on your way to work. Also the mug has a foam rubber ring glued to the bottom which will come off after a few runs through an ordinary dishwasher. I do not recommend this item."
3,Looks Cool,"This looks very nice on my Ipod, but within the first week of having it the tail fell off. Nothing a little superglue cant fix but I wonder why they even bother to put the tail there since it falls off so easy."
5,Good Book,This book is very good as it is has a very professional approach.It caters to most of the problems which one encounters during professional Asp programming.
4,good reference book,"As you I go along developing my web app, this book answers most of my questions, fexample, how to unload/load your application when you want to unload your dll from the application and vice versa. Before finding the answer in this book, I just rebooted the server. Along the way, it always answers my question to perplexing problems that I stumble upon, i.e why isn't my web app preserved the session id.I have to admit that this is not a book that I would read on spare time. I don't know whether it's the flow of the structure or what. But I always get lost in the ""too much"" information supplied. Hence I cannot give it 5 stars.For reference, this is a book to keep if you're developing ASP for one reason; as you become more comfortable with ASP, this book provides answers to your ""no-more"" beginner questions."
5,A right book for even a programmer's hopeful,"Even if I don't have any working experience as a computer grogrammer now(just finished my training) and even if this book is designed to satisfy the needs of those who are already well practiced in the skills of ASP and serve-side Web application development, I still found this book is very,very helpful. I hope I can get a job as ASP programmer with the genuine knowledge this book gives to me in the near future."
3,Bloated,"Like all WROX books, this book is written by too many authors that have different writing style. The biggest drawback with think kind of book is too much introduction on every chapter. This makes the book difficult to absorb since too much time is spent in introduction. Also, the goal of this book seems to make it as thick as possible. I would be interested in a book that is more succint, higher quality, and lighter to carry around."
4,Good way to enhance your ASP skills,"This book is definetly not for beginners, but an intermediate programmer can use it improve his ASP skills and a good beginning for users of Windows 2000"
3,"Great for reference, horrible for learning!","If you have never worked with ASP before, then you should just put this book down and go pick up Beginnning Active Server Pages 3.0 before you try and tackle this monster.If you have worked with ASP before and are fairly comfortable with it, then this is a great reference book for you. Them writing is a little dry and dense in material, and very hard to read from front to cover. However, if you are working with certain components or are just getting stuck with a certain feature, then this book is a must-have on your bookshelf. It lacks some of the user friendliness of other Wrox books, but I don't think that is what they were shooting for with this book. So if you want to take your ASP programming to the next level, I recommend this book."
5,Great book - Now how about getting to work on the technology,"This is a must have for folks looking to upgrade/deploy on Win2K.. The XML section in particular is brand new and a great real-world example on how to deploy XML in a practical mannerIf you're a developer who is interested in working on these cutting edge technologies, drop us a line at jobs@auctionrover.com! We're looking for some great ASP developers out there and have a progressive developer-friendly environment..."
4,just want to see the other reviews,this is the stupidest review system I've ever seen... you have to post a review to view the other reviews... isn't the point of reviews to base your decision on buying a book?
3,Spanish Version!,Espera una versión en español de este libro en el año 2003. Te será más fácil hacer un curso de inglés :(
4,Must have for ASP developers but starting to look dated,"I have yet to meet an ASP developer who doesn't use this book on a regular basis. It covers all of the ASP fundamentals thoroughly and clearly, however some of the more advanced features that came with ASP 3.0 and VBScript 5 are missing, especially the use of VBScript Classes. Coverage of ADO is excellent. If you are an *e-commerce* developer, I strongly suggest you also draw on other resources; the section on performance in this book is rather superficial. Also, the section on XML is now looking dated. Treat this as a vital part of your web-development bookshelf rather than the definitive book."
4,Excellent book - Recommend it to anyone,This is an excellent book for anyone interested in web development (which just about covers everyone in the programming world). It covers all the information that you need build a professional solution. It is the bible of ASP. Well done to the authors and WROX they are definitely an excellent publisher (my collection of computer books is about 50% from WROX).
3,"Lots of Material, but Very Weak ADO Coverage","This book might be OK if you want an encyclopedia of information. But the ADO chapters are very weak. And, for me, ADO is what I need to know the most.As for debugging, I guess you can cover debugging ASP in just 4 pages. After all, ASP has virtually no debugging capability at all. You can't even set the next statement. And, looking at variables in the immediate window leaves a great deal to be desired. Even so, this book's coverage of debugging was lacking. I guess that's OK if you never plan to have any bugs.Does anyone really care about integrating with Active Directory? Or, writing C++ components? Or 10 other obscure topics? If so, this book is for you.If instead, you want to build a database application using VBScript, I suggest you use another book. I think I wasted my money.Of the entire book, I can use maybe 30 pages."
5,Excellent Excellent,"Don't waste your time with anything else. This books covers everything having to do with ASP. Whether you're dealing with COM, MTS, ADO, CDO, whatever, you will find clear, organized, and lucid explanations of all of the relevant technologies here.I had the 2.0 version of this book, which I thought was really good, but this one is even better in terms of presentation, writing style, and depth of coverage."
5,"Excellent, thorough, and good examples","I had the prior Wrox book, and I also have the O'Reilly ASP, but this one is a standout piece of work. It is thorough, covering everything from basic ASP to advanced ASP, with stops along the way for MTS/XML/XSL and related technologies.While I've found a few errors, they are mostly typos and I've run across no real deal-killers. Somewhat surprisingly, the book is well-written and gets its points across directly and with a minimum of fluff and arm-waving.Highly recommended."
5,"Elf, Mother, Daughter, Water and Air; say hello to Emma","Unique, that is the way we can describe Emma Shapplin's ""Etterna"". The singer reflects her inner growth by delecting us with melodies that go far beyond imagination. Her style can only be compared to Sarah Brightman's ""Eden"" but Shapplin's voice is sweeter and much more dramatic. Pieces like ""Leonora"" and ""La Silente Riva"" reflect that wonderful fascination that Ms. Shapplin shows for barroque Italian, with all of it's dramatism and melancholy. In the the other hand ""La Notte Etterna"" and ""Céltica"" make the listener go through different stages of their inner soul, learning about their own way of approaching that elven and magical creature who sings."
4,Similar to Carmine Meo but prettier,"OK. There are still a lot of spaceship noises starting some of the tracks, but once the songs get going there are some pretty melodies in there. And Emma does have a lovely voice. Not only that, but the album notes include English."
5,Trance Opera.,Bought the disk a while ago and I still listen to it. I was in great shape when I got it and the music sounds great.
5,Stunning Creativity - Clever - Funny!,"If you want first class entertainment by some of the most creative and clever artists in 1930s Hollywood, this movie is your cup of tea. I was thoroughly entertained non-stop without a second of ho-hum. This is a work of art filled with stunning creativity - it's clever and very funny, too!"
2,Ought to be in Color.,"The Dancing Pirate was one of the earliest films RKO made in the 100% new Technicolor process. This DVD is regrettably in Black and White. If you must see this, try to find it in color. Good luck."
2,Absolute Rubbish,"I watched this piece of junk thinking that I would see Rita Hayworth give a great performance and would be able to tell people I watched a great, unknown Rita Hayworth film. Boy, was I mistaken.Yes, Rita Hayworth is in here but she is practically not billed at all, there is no plot that I can recall but I do know that Frank Morgan (""The Wizard of Oz"")was in it, and it was an early Techicolor experiment which failed miserably. How is it that ""The Dancing Pirate"" looks so awful, but ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" look so beautiful? Yes, I know there were a few years in-between 1936 and 1939 but all three of these movies introduced Technicolor to American audiences.So, all in all, don't you dare buy or even think of watching this rubbish. You're better off watching ""The Wizard of Oz"" again. Both of these movies have Frank Morgan and Technicolor, and ""The Wizard of Oz"" looks better and has a great plot."
4,"Great price, plays most media","My girlfriend was looking for a portable DVD player that played Video CD's (VCD) as well as DVD's. I read somewhere that this particular player played VCD's. So far it does the job.LIKES:1.Easy connection to a TV.2.TINY remote control.3.Sound from the two small speakers.4.Picture isn't too bad either.5.The 7"" screen size is just right.6.Battery pack can be charged connected or disconnectedfrom DVD player.7.PRICE!!!8.Two headphone jacks.DISLIKES:1.Battery pack makes unit heavy.2.Battery pack sticks out a ways from the back.So far this DVD player has met and exceeded my girlfriend and I's expectations. We plan on taking it with us on a trip to her home country. It will really get a good field test then! If anything changes I will do an updated review."
3,ok...,"the cd was scratched and broken box well, but okay for the price I paid, I could not hope for the best, thank you ..."
2,For the completist... yes. Anyone else... no,This CD is definitely for the DEVO fan who must own everything the bad has done. For everyone else it may prove to be hard on the ears. The sound quality is sub par and shockingly that is kind of important in a recording.I am not sure if it is due to the source recording was too rough to do much with or horrible post production. The end result is kind of a mess.
2,Too much vibrato,"The instruments are excellent, but HER voices is loaded with too much vibrato. It is a pity, really. So the softness of the music is not then appreciated"
5,"Before they ""Souled Out"", they were the Kings of Funk!","Now this is what I remember Kool & the Gang as, a funk based band out of Newark, New Jersey that made r&b hip in the pre-disco days. Classic tracks such as ""Jungle Boogie"", ""Hollywood Swingin'"" and ""Funky Stuff"". My personal favorite is the smooth but soulful ""Summer Madness"". But after this release, the band would go Top 40 and in my mind lose their soulful edge. But this is a great retrospect of their early work. Check it out and discover the pre-JT age!!"
4,Works well,"This product does what I expected it to do so I am pleased with it.I don't know if it is cutting my elec bill,I do feel that I have saved some energy by using these bulbs and I see no down side in it for me."
4,Nice clean white light,"These take a second or so to illuminate, which I kind of find a plus, not instant bright ligth. I enjoy the clean white light they give off. I bought 2 packs, one lamp did not work. Really not worth the energy savings to return the bulb. And even though these are compact, they will NOT work in all applications.Since the one lamp did not work, I have questions about how long they will last."
2,Quality and Design issues,"I have used 4 of the 6 that I ordered. The light is clean and bright, and not harsh. And it was the cost-savings and environmental benefits that compelled my purchase. However, one of the four bulbs was defective--it burnt out on the 3rd day, after less that 5 hours of use. And the dimensions of these lights are much longer than conventional bulbs, so they stick out from our kitchen's recessed lighting fixtures as well as the sconce that illuminates the driveway. I would recommend finding alternatives closer in length to conventional bulbs."
4,An emotive introduction to an influencial artists work.,"C.F.Tunnicliffe was one of the most significant British wildlife artists of the 20th century. This book draws together his own words and pictures of the Peregrine falcon, a bird that has suffered greatly over recent years. Robert Gillmor introduces the book before Tunnicliffe's own words take you to the dizzying heights of South Stack, Anglesey, where he records the struggle of a pair of Peregrine as they raise their young high above the Irish Sea. For those privileged to have visited his haunts, the book is an emotive return. For those of you unfamiliar with Tunnicliffe's Cob, Malltraeth and Shorelands retreat, this will surely whet your appetite. I hope that you feel inspired to add this book to your Tunnicliffe collection, and if new to his work, feel bold enough to explore his adopted home in North Wales through his artist eyes."
1,confusing movie,The review/summary for this movie was totally different from when I was watching it. I can't believe I brought this crap too. It made no sense and the actors/actress were everywhere; it jumped from one short confusing story to another's character confusing story. At the end it didn't even make sense or how it ties in. Sure the theme is money..maybe for a book or essay it wold make sense to put different examples in but this was too confusing. NOT ENJOYABLE
4,goldie loc almost gold,"Being a fan of Goldie Loc its hard to say too much bad bout the man, the thing i like about goldie loc is he keeps it real on his joints, real west coast fans or hip hop fans in general don`t need 10 pages of credits & thanx in the damn album cover, we wanna hear some good music and this is what Goldie Loc does, unlike a previous reviewer by the name of G.ZAWADZKI that obviously don`t know too much about this eastsida this is not his debut solo album he has 2 independ albums out there(tha after party & biznezz never personal) this album shows his continuous growth in an otherwise underrated west coast, buy this album and help bring back the west coast 2 where it belongs!"
3,"Generally good, but lacks depth","Eventhough the book covers most wireless related topics on network planning (CDMA-2000 is an obvious ommission, especially when describing the 3G rates: no mention about EV-DO revA and its potential for peak rates of 3.84 Mb/s), I thought it lacked the depth on certain areas.Most items of concern for network planners are mentioned, but none of the issues were addressed in depth.I was disappointed about the last chapter (4G). It lacked substance and drew some parallels between OFDM and GSM that I thought were not well linked.Some typos are spread over the book (I could notice OFDM written and OFMD), and page 209 had several asterisks in a sentence addressing the complexity of SGSN and GGSN dimensioning."
3,Adult Humor,"A strange comedic Anime...subject matter sometimes makes you go WHAT!!! did they just say! Downer is it's Japanese with sub titles and sometimes you missed the point by trying to read and watch the action. If it were dubbed over couldn't hurt...it's only animation. Also Amazon should add more to the Prime Anime list that's NOT, Dark, mystical, and demonistic.(lightrn up!}"
3,Its good.,"If you like maid-type animes then this isn't half bad. Nothing too over the top in this series. If your under 13 i wouldn't recommend it. It is subtitled, but i think that they would have chosen bad English voice actors anyway, because this isnt a well known anime in America. So if you want to watch a girl and her sister who have become maids for a young boy in his mansion, then go ahead and watch this. Its not that bad. But I will go ahead and warn you that it does leave you off wondering what happens next, there is no real ending, at least it doesn't feel that way to me.I gave it a 3 because its pretty generic and not super impressive story wise, but at least its cute, short and the animation is nice. If you are bored, I say why not? Read the manga if you like this. Its cute too."
1,subbed,"subtitled so not really worth watching. for reading books are far more enjoyable. It isnt even like you get a better idea of what the voice actors intended with subbed, as the voice inflections in japanese are not even used the same as english"
2,Sucralose can cause migraines,"This stuff tasted and worked fine, but like many people, Sucralose gives me migraines. I avoid the stuff like the plague and was surprised to find it in my mouthwash. Taught me to read all labels more carefully."
2,Tastes like children's cough syrup,"Maybe you're thinking that orange plus alcohol equals screwdriver, but actually, the look and taste of ""Natural Citrus"" Listerine will remind you of the cloying medicinal syrups you had to take when you were twelve years old and sick. This is a failed flavor experiment. If you don't like the astringent taste of original Listerine, try one of the mint varieties; they cover a brisk taste with an even brisker taste, which works fine."
4,"Donna does a great job explaining, step by step.","After seeing Donna as a guest on the Discovery Channel's Interior Motives with Christopher Lowell, I just had to get her book. And true to what Christopher and Donna claimed, this book is excellent in describing, step-by-step, exactly how to make curtains, swags, etc. I am so pleased with the results. I just started sewing again after a ten year hiatus and was a little nervous, but my draperies look every bit as good as the professionals and I thank Donna for her efforts in putting her skills to print, simplfying the task and enabling me to overcome the fears of custom decorating the windows in my home myself. Because of Donna, I have a $600 look for only $200!"
4,easy and follow and fun to do,"I've had a difficult time finding instructions for window treatments I'd actually want to have in my home. Donna's selections are up-to-date, easy to accomplish and fun to do. I've been sewing for about 5 years, but was able to create very professional looking treatments for about a 1/4 of the cost you'd expect to pay in stores."
5,Like A Fine Wine,"I am unclear as to the current availability of this CD (as of 16 Oct 02). No matter. I feel so strongly about this CD that I recommend buying it USED or continually checking with amazon to buy it new. It will be well worth any hassle. Hank had 38 Billboard Hits from 1947-1953 all but a couple are right here on one 40 track CD. All are great. The greatest compliment one can pay an album is to state that the more you play it, the BETTER it sounds.I've had this one over 10 years and it improves with age! No one gets to the soul of country like Hank.If you like traditional country, Hank is the grandaddy of it all. If you've heard of Hank. but don't know what the fuss is about- you will."
5,ONE OF HANK'S FINEST,This album brought back many childhood memories of my older brothers and sisters and also my parents listening and dancing to Hank Williams. These songs have a lot of meaning in the lyrics and Hank was a man of emotion.. We lost a great singer at the young age of 29...but he lives on in his songs..It is worth every penny and more...
4,#129 on the Rolling Stone 500,Well #129 aint so bad fer an ol hick from out west. I always listen to this CD set when Im grooming my horses or plucking the chickens. Ol bess jus luves it for that special night out by the barn when the mood is right...Just kidding.This is an essential album to have if you like country music. I like the simplicity and frankness Hank uses in his lyrics. I cant imagine a better greatest hits compilation for Hank than this one. A worthwhile purchase.
1,"The text is wrong, no keypad included.","I ordered this face plate for a 2035a. The text for it clearly says that a keypad is included. Without the key pad, it will not fit the 2035a. With the keypad it would. Even though is says it comes with a key pad, it doesn't. I will return it.""Each faceplate contains a keypad, a power button, a clear plastic lens, and installation instructions."" This came neither with a keypad nor instructions.This is the first time I've been disappointed with an item from Amazon. The real blame is on Kyocera. This same item is on their website. It also says that a keypad is included. That one probably also does not come with a keypad."
4,Crooners at Christmas,"I'm happy with the CD. Lots of old favorites. There are one or two songs I don't care for, but the rest are great."
5,The perfect book for beginners,This book delivers all it promises. You will get the foundations that will help you explore Flash MX with confidence. A user said in a previous review that the book moves to slow but thats the way it must be when building foundations about something. I found that approach very convenient when learning. The way that the exercises and the main project is inserted with the explanations helps a lot. Well it's the right book if you want to start learning Flash MX.
5,GOOD,"This is an awesome book for Flash mx rookies, it covers the basic concepts of flash mx. This book also gives you LOTS of tutorials to do and teaches individuals some common flash effects. However, again this is just a book for noobs, don't expect you can do a 100% fancy flash site after reading this book."
2,"To much example, not enough reference","The foundation books feel like my sons preschool class. Very fluffy, project oriented reading, but useless as a reference. Just get to the point and show me how to do it! There's a balance between example and reference that make tutorial books valuable, this book and other ""Foundation"" or ""Friends of Ed"" books I've bought or looked at weigh in too heavy on the example side and the ""how do I do this"" part is mucked up in the mire of examples.If you have NO flash experience what so ever, then this might (might) be for you, but if you've decided to finally get to learning the details of flash and start getting something out of it, then perhaps the Flash MX Bible would be a better choice, that was my choice and I'm much happier with it. My choice for ActionScript is Macromedias' Advanced Flash MX Actionscripting. It's not really advanced, but it is very clear and gets to the point."
4,Flash MX Foundation,"I'm a CS major whose desire to learn new tools is waning, so understand that I had apprehensions about picking up another tech book to sit on my shelf. Needless to say, after going through the entire book, I have found Foundation Flash MX to be...A great, easy-to-read book, with step-by-step examples providing solid foundation for real projects using tool, sans ActionScript.When reading through the book, I recommend skipping the ActionScript write up, in favor of going straight to Foundation ActionScript MX, which, incidentally, makes no assumtion that you've read Foundation Flash MX.My only minor gripe is the lack of integration between the two closely related books.Enjoy!"
5,Emily Kwan Rules!! A Great Thriller!!,Emily Kwan stars as a voluptuous widow whose husbands die under mysterious circumstances.It's a great thriller!!
1,Very poor,This book is writin very poorly for the beginner. Instead of showing you each step they kind of put everything together. Example they never really show how to edit a data entry by selecting it. Its always if this user has rights to edit it then they can. That is not what a beginner needs to learn.
4,Good book despite typos,"The authors did a wonderful job of explaining ASP to BEGINNERS. On the bad side, there are quite a lot of typos which could have been avoided, that's why I give only 4 stars...I'd like to disagree with ""Seior Developer from Washington DC"" (original name preserved) that choice of Access and absence of Oracle is a minus for this book. Hello! How many of us Joe Code-For-Fun Programmers have Oracle installed on our home PCs?For those who want to learn more I recommend ""Professional ASP 2.0"" from Wrox - another great book."
2,Loved it at first but errors abound!,"I loved this book till I started working on chapters 13, 14 and 15. I can only imagine the other reviewers haven't gotten that far, or are only using it as a reference. Before you buy, take a look at the Wrox support site for this book. First, the errata pages are huge in number (bad sign), and there are still unanswered questions on these three chapters. We users are helping each other as much as possible but we are not ASP gurus. Having bought four Wrox books on Visual Basic I am shocked the quality of editing in this one! I don't know if there is anything better out there or not."
3,Helpful introduction but that's it.,It's a useful and easy introduction to ASP's but cannot lead you into meeting your more comprehensive e-business needs.
1,Book is plagued with errors in the samples.,"This book offers good content and touches base on many topics, however many of the samples have errors and are inconsistant in their programming style. It is very frustrating when you copy something letter for letter and it doesn't work! Then you spend an hour looking over the code and find out that it's their fault!"
2,Don't buy unless you have NT Workstation,"In the beginning of the book, the author references a URL to download a service pack from Microsoft that is required to be able to load Personal Web Server (PWS). Without PWS you can't do anything in this book. The author states that this service pack will also work for Windows98 machines. THIS IS NOT TRUE. There is no support at the Microsoft site that will fix the installation problems for Windows98. The Windows98 installation CD won't even install a working copy of PWS included on the CD. Microsoft's answer for Windows98 users is to spend more money and upgrade to NT workstation. It seems like a good book, but without being able to get a working copy of Microsoft PWS it's not worth much. Unless you have NT Workstation or a working copy of PWS or your own Internet Information Server - don't bother buying this book because you can't do any of the examples/exercises."
3,Don't buy this book if you know VB or any other language.,"This book is very basic. If you know programming buy Professional ASP. If you do not know object oriented programming, buy this book. Another thing that I didn't like about this book is that it relied to much on it's own case study programs. In many cases you are shown how to do something for their example, but left in the dark about how or what they are doing. This book did teach me the basics though, and I was able to create an intranet page for cataloging equipment. A word of warning, if you buy this book stick with the examples from the beginning because that is the core of this book."
4,Very good ASP books for beginners,"This book is a very good book for beginners. But I recommend reading ""Active Server Pages for Dummies"" first to get an idea of writing simple ASP file. Then, read this book to get a clearer and more systemetic understanding of ASP. Examples in the book are practical and helpful. There are some typos in the book and small errors in chapter 15, but you can figure it out easily by yourself. The next book about ASP I will read ""professional ASP 2.0"", which is more thorough but need some ASP knowledge and experience to understand."
5,Excellent ASP intro for those with VB background,"I am an instructor at a technical college. I teach a program where Visual Basic and Java are the two main languages. I search for good computer books and find very few. This is a good one. It is clear, concise and contains no major technical errors. The examples are well constructed and plentiful. If you know VB and a little HTML, this book opens up a whole new world for you."
5,The ASP book for people with scripting experience,"Great book. However, you better have experience with scripting (i.e. JavaScript/JScript or, even better, VBScript). It goes nowhere into maniplulation. It delves into the basics only - which is GOOD. This is a great book ONLY IF USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NEXT STEP UP: Professional Active Server Pages 2.0. Grammatical errors are numorous, and there are even examples that do not work. However, if you have any idea of what you're doing, you should be able to correct them yourself."
5,This is the best computer book that I bought in my life!,"Buy this book if you are a beginning to intermediate programmer and want to learn about ASP, VBscript. This book is very easy to follow and understand. I have bought over 15 computer books and I think this book is the best."
3,Good book if you were only able to install PWS on 95 machine,Looks like a good book. It lacks in preparing your machine for Personal Web Server installation. The headache is to install software on your machine. I have windows 95. Maybe this book is good for NT machines. It's been a month and I am still on first chapter to prepare my machine for next chapter.
4,Great book for beginners,"This book is great for those just starting out. I looked at quite a few ASP books when I was starting out and the layout and topics covered in this book will get you off to a good start. I especially like the case study at the end where you can see all that you have learnt being applied in a nice example with .mdb DB's and all the ASP code.They teach the baisc programming concepts like IF, CASE and LOOP and show how they are used in ASP. The book concetrates on using VBScript for all the server side scripting which is what the bulk of sites I have worked on use aswell.Wrox in my opinion do a pretty good job in showing you what can be done with some ASP and .mdb's in a short amount of time.I recommend reading the book through once to get a general feel for the topics covered and then going back and studying the examples more carfeully.regards Russ"
2,Difficult to extract information,"If you have ever programmed before, you will find this book difficult to use. The Authors feel they have to explain and give examples for everything. This may sound useful, but it simply takes too much work to extract the information your after. If you just want to know the syntax of an active server command, forget it. Rather than providing a concise description, time intensive examples are given."
4,Good book..,"However I think that if you have good grounding in other technologies like VB, ADO, HTML and are pretty swithced on in general I think a better investment would be to buy the Professional Version of this book..Otherwise it is certainly wiser to buy this book first..RegardsJohn Hodgson"
5,Great Book,"I picked up a copy of this book when I was on vacation in Alaska fishing the Kenai. First off, the author is an execellent outdoors writer and really makes you wish you were there. As far as fishing info, the book gives a great overview of the most productive techniques (which are used by practically every guide in the area) used to catch each type of salmon and trout in the area. It gives good information about all the local rivers, streams, and lakes,and most importantly timing information on salmon runs and most productive trout periods. The first section on Lake Fishing is a bit more geared toward local anglers with access to a canoe, but I would definately recommend this book for anyone planning a fishing trip to the Kenai Peninsula."
1,Authorized Jeep dealer was not able to program to function.,Jeep dealer was unable to get the remote to be recognized to operate. Waiting for authorization to return for credit.
1,The worst book on C#,"This is the worst book on C#. Lots of mistakes in the programs and the text. Also, there is a huge amount of overlap between all the different author's chapters, none of whom seem to really know anything beyond the most simple aspects of C#.Buy a different book."
2,Too many cooks spoil the food .,"Hi,There's a lot of mixed reviews about this book . The table contents promises to give a lot of information which it does but not efficiently . I am C++ programmer ,the intial chapters are easy to understand since they are basic oops that I already know .. and the intial chapters on windows and asp was good I felt becoz I had worked on my own before I went thro this . After that it was tooo much of information not written well .In the sense you just keep reading without undestanding half of it becoz the author's expect you to know all the concepts and they confuse what you know by puttting it in words that are so confusing . The flow of thought if missing ...ralph."
1,Worst book on C#,Worst book on C# currently available. I had so many problems with syntax errors in the examples. Don't waste your money on this book.
2,Hodgepodge put together by too many authors,"Wrox was slammed by the user groups for these books with ten authors. They've gotten smarter: now they only put one photograph on the cover. But that misses the point; the book is still more a collection of essays by different writers than a book.There are parts of this book that are fairly good, but overall it does not cover the material coherently, and it is 25-50% bigger than it should be for the material covered.There are better choices elsewhere. I just posted a review for the O'Reilly book, which I think is a much better choice."
2,All Over the Place,"I have to agree with the previous reviewers who say this book is not up to Wrox standards. This book is ""all over the place"", meaning there's little cohesion between chapters. This is probably because of all of the authors involved. It makes reading it very confusing.Here's a specific example. When discussing struct's vs. classes, the book starts talking about how memory allocation is different for each, and they referred to an earlier discussion of memory. I didn't recall them discussing memory earlier in the book, so I looked it up in the index. They had given it a sentence or two - obviously written by another author, and not intended to provide the depth later assumed.Unfortunately, I have purchased 3 C# books, and they're all weak. This, though, is the weakest. I gave ""C# Bible"" 2 stars as well, but I actually think that's a better book."
2,Be warned: Wrox has been sold!,This book does have good information if you are new to C# but do not expect to get the examples off the web as the book promises. The website is not providing the promised downloads and only collecting email addresses for future notification.The book has worked well for me as a .NET reference guide but I wouldn't have bought this volume if I had known about the lack of promised support.
3,An okay book,"Some of the chapters in the book are good, some are vague. The book seems to lack the focus.Many chapter-writers have tried to fatten the book unnecessarily with unclear garbage.I would suggest anyone wanting to get started on C#, to buy the Andrew Troelsen book from APress. It's the most clear & concise one available."
1,By far the worst book on C#,"Of all the C# books I own (I own 5), this is by far the worst. Can you learn from this book? Sure, but you have to deal with mistakes in the code examples, crummy explanations of how C# works, and bad editing.The numerous authors of this book have 50% overlap in their coverage, but each of them miss the point in their explanations."
1,Cursory introduction spread over 1311 pages,"Don't expect to have a deep understanding of c#/.net after reading this book. This book is contains tons of filler, useless tables, stupid humor, unwarranted opinion and source code. The book has useful information, but you will waste your valuable time sifting through the generic Wrox template to find it. Wrox must have a fill-in-the-blank program for writing these books. Save your money, there are many others to choose from."
2,Not up to Wrox standards,"I have come to expect great things of Wrox books. I was hooked by Robert Vieira's Professional SQL Server Programming. This book is not up to that standard. While the former was lively, engaging, and made me feel like I had a live mentor walking me through the material, this book is more dull, pedantic, and tedious. Most annoying, though, are the code examples. The authors start out with clear examples that the reader can duplicate or load from the code samples. Then, by chapter 8, the examples and the context are increasingly flawed. I find the text flowing into an example, but I'm not sure whether it's a new project I should create, or just a snippet that I shouldn't bother trying, or what. And the code samples are a mess. They don't align with the chapters, and often they don't work.The book covers all important C# development topics, but I'm disappointed with the execution."
4,A lovely tango disc but it may not satisfy the purists.,"I really enjoy this CD. It's not your usual tango orchestra - just violins, accordion and piano, - so it lacks the depth of sound that many would expect of say, Sexteto Mayor or the other Argentine bands. But the tangos are played with a verve and elegance that I love, and its versions of two tango classics, La Cumparsita and Jalousie, are superb. (In fact all the tracks on this CD are outstanding). It also has Por Una Cabeza, the tango that Al Pacino immortalised in the movie 'Scent of A Woman'. With a distinctly 1930's 'palm court orchestra' or 'afternoon tea dance' quality to it which I really like, for me this is the fire and passion of tango par excellence. I'm well aware however, that purists and lovers of Argentine tango may view it otherwise."
5,Really Great,"The dance company that I belong to...called State Street Dance Company...used this CD for part of one of their programs! This CD had some really great pieces, and even though the show was in 1999, i still watch it sometimes just to hear the music! I may just be a teenager, but this music really says something to me and always makes me want to dance!!"
5,"Entertaining, thoughtful and very accessible intro to Buddhism!","I've read a lot of self-help books geared toward women and this one is one of the best I've seen. The author blends her own personal experiences with real Buddhist teachings to create a very accessible, enjoyable guide to infusing Buddhism, especially meditation, into your daily life as a modern woman. Her approach is light, fun, and informative, you feel like you're learning something in a less serious way. I highly recommend this book for anyone looking for an introduction to Buddhism, meditation, and general advice to start exploring the mind-body connection."
2,"Good game, but bad for new PCs","I originally bought this game for a 486/66Mhz computer. It ran in a DOS prompt, but I could never get my game to save. Worse yet, I tried running it on a newer 400 Mhz machine and the game ran too fast. It was as if the entire game was running in double fast forward. The game has little value if you can't run it.The game itself is fun. ThemePark is the predecessor of Sim Themepark (aka Themepark World), which in turn is the predecessor of Sim Coaster. The graphics are pretty much the same, except you can't walk around your park like you can in the other two. You can still ride all your rides, but the number and theme of the rides is far more limited than in Sim Themepark and Sim Coaster.Overall, if you want to run a themepark, buy Sim Themepark (Sim Coaster isn't much different, and Sim Themepark is cheaper) or Rollercoaster Tycoon. Both are worth the money, and they will actually run on your computer."
1,Terrible,"This game sucked big time. The graphics and sound quality was horrible, and the plot was a little sketchy. I would not buy it!"
2,Software for motorola Phone.,When I first got it I could make ringtones and back up my phone fine. As it went through various upgrades its functionality started dropping off. It got to the point it was worthless and I uninstalled it for better software. I'm glad I removed it and will NEVER use it again.
4,Rushed 2nd album still has plenty of gems,"BTO pushed this effort out just a few months after it's debut, and it showed. But for every forgettable number like Tramp or I Don't Have To Hide (definitely BTO's worst song), there's a killer rock classic like Blown, Stonegates (hear the similarity to the Allman Brothers' Ramblin' Man?) and Let It Ride."
3,Solid Album from another era,"As BTO goes, this a pretty good album. No B.S. here, just guitar, bass, drums, and a bunch of big red-haired Canadian guys shouting their brains out. Most songs are very solid; ""Tramp"" is kind of lame and ""Takin Care of Business"" is probably one of the 10 worst songs to ever become an AOR hit in the US. Aside from that this is a good album from a band hitting its stride. The only thing that really bugs me is the sound of the drums. Whoever engineered this album should be shot for letting such a HORRENDUS drum sound appear on tape. Talk about your 70's cardboard box sound. Real cardboard boxes would have been an improvement."
5,"Stop Making Excuses, This Is A No-Brainer.","For whatever reason, you've decided to shop for music via Amazon.com and, while shopping, you stumbled across this album and you aren't sure whether or not you should spend the money and time on a band you've never heard of before, right?Well, my newfound friend, I've got some good news for you. The lofty price of $11.99 is well worth the risk on this one.Paperface has been cranking out inspired music for years, now, and this newest release only speaks to this band's ability to continue to push the envelope in genre creativity.Still don't believe me? Try visiting the band's website and testing out a couple mp3s on your playlist - the music-obsessed child in you will celebrate the tunes while the expense-fearing adult in you will rejoice at the price."
3,NOT AN EPIC CONCLUSION,"I am disappointed in the conclusion to this series ..The series started out great with the first couple of booksand I thought that maybe we have a storyteller to competewith Goodkind, Jordan and Martin..NOT>...It is almost like the author lost interest in the saga andfilled in the last couple of books with banalities...There was no anti-climax there was no build up to a climaxin short NO SATISFACTION with the conclusion to this series..I would not recommend this series now, but if you had asked meafter reading the first two books I would have said YES!!Maybe the author spread himself too thin to give himselfenough time to do the story justice..."
3,Yo Wrox - Hire some editors,"This is basically a fine book that covers a lot of ground. As a long time CF developer, I have read almost every CF book on the market, and I would only consider this one after I had Ben Forta's WACK and Advanced books and the O'Reilly Programming CF.I see the poor editing and inconsitant examples as part of a downward trend for Wrox books, which used to be right at the top, but now are declining in quality. It is disappointing."
4,Good book and a few 'wishes' left..,"Good book, clearly written and with a good balance of examples, explanation and code snippets. Professional CF 5.0 also describes and explains some advanced topics like WDDX, COM and WAP but these are a little to advanced for me personally -for know that is- :)My wishlist is based on the really intermediate level: I could use some more elaboration on topics like (sorting) 'structures' and 'cfmail'. Also, the chapters on 'state management' and 'graphs' could use some more real-life example's.Concluding, these authors are the professionals, there is lots to learn here and the book it is clearly written: buy it!"
2,The downward spiral of WROX,WROX books used to be the only ones I'd buy; after having a grand ol' time with the ASP and ASP Databases series. The Professional series has been a real disappointment (and waste of money!). The books tend to be more wordy than necessary and spend too much time on the obvious and too little on the abstract. Cold Fusion is a fairly straight-forward programming language. WROX has somehow managed to make it much more. Perhaps too many cooks in the kitchen; looks like they had 18 authors put this beast together.Look elsewhere...
5,A realized vision,"From the Mapleshade Records Review on their website:Clifford's big band wasn't a machine of stunning precision like the Basie Band. It was a warm and swinging group with great jazz soloists, akin to Dizzy's big band from the late '40s. That's just what this CD lays down--a large, joyous jam session of seasoned musicians. JazzTimes says Clifford is ""...clearly inspired throughout...he caresses the ballads with long wisps of smoky-toned lyricism, and ignites the cookers with his fiery amalgam of blues and bop."" Fifteen first-rate jazzmen, all personal friends and admirers of Clifford, jam with him on ""Evidence"", ""I Waited For You"", ""Angelica"" and a handful of Jordan originals. Soloists include Dizzy Reece, Benny Powell, Junior Cook, Charles Davis and Kiane Zawadi."
4,"for under twenty bucks, a good shoe","For under twenty bucks this is a good pair of shoes from a maker who has made some of the most comfortable walking shoes I have worn in the past. These shoes come with a minimum activity rating- which means they are for walking. The heel has a soft, giving bounce when I walk- which is appreciated. There is no instep support- something I miss from high end athletic shoes. The shoes are very comfortable- comfortable enough that I put a brand new pair on and with no break-in period walked in them for an hour without any discomfort. At this price they are definitely worth the money if you want a reasonable walking shoe and don't want to pay $60-$120 at an athletic shoe store in the mall."
5,Excellent Product,This product worked great! We travelled Internationally to the U.S. with two different car seats - both seats fit perfectly in each bag (with plenty of extra space). The shoulder straps made transport easy while in the airports and the simple design made using the bags quick and hassle free. Great product for a great price!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"It is very simple, the product that came inside the box is not the one that is displayed on the picture on the packaging. I bought this product and was suprised as it does not open on the bottom (as advertised) but opens as a regular bag, with the shoulder strap inconveniently placed right where the car seat goes making it very difficult to put the seat inside. Not only is the product not effective and very complicated to use, but it is NOT what is advertised, it is a completetely different product."
2,"Not bad, not great","It worked alright. Made traveling a little easier with a child. It isn't very thick and has holes after one trip through the airport, you get what you pay for."
3,I Love the Bag... But It Got a Hole The First Time I Used it!,"I absolutely love this bag. It covered my Britax Marathon and my hubby was able to carry it through the airport with no problem. But how disappointed I was when taking the carseat out of the bag after returning from JFK airport in NY, I discovered a hole in the bag. I think it was from the airline crew tossed it around. But to see a hole on the first usage - wow... how shoddily made is that!Fix that problem guys, and I'm a loyal customer for the rest of m'life!"
4,Great Bag for Travel!,"I was pleased to see how LARGE this bag truly was. Within 1 week, we put this bag on 4 flights and we didn't have any problems. We fit two car seats in it (one being a booster) and it was perfect for what we bought it for! It's definitely not square when you use it, so don't expect to hold it in that perfect shape -- however it worked for us because I threw in packages of diapers/pull ups/sheets, etc. that didn't fit in my regular suitcase!Ideal purchase! Durable for sure!"
3,"OK, but not great","The bag is big - large enough for the car seat, diapers, coats, toys, etc. I noticed a few small tears in the fabric of the bag upon return from the first and only trip we have used it on. My only real complaint is that there is no way to lock the bag. The end of the zipper snaps into place but ther is no place for a padlock."
3,not as strong as i had hoped,"since i opted for the cheaper of all the bags i looked at, i should have expected it to be a bit weak, but i was still a bit shocked when after the first use the bottom of the bag was already ripped. i did like that it was spacious and easy to get the car seat in and out of though. (we have the graco infant seat and there was plenty of room for the seat plus a pack of diapers and wipes) the long strap was convenient to carry, but car seats in general are large and oddly shaped so it was kind of clunky to carry around. overall, if you are looking for a bag to use a lot, i would suggest checking out one of the more expensive ones, probably will get more bang for you buck"
3,Just okay,"I liked this product at first. I was able to fit extra things in it, like sand toys and blankets. We checked it at the gate on the way there. It was fine but on our return flight, we checked it with our luggage so we wouldn't have to carry it through the airport...bad decision. Now, it had 2 holes in it."
4,Great carseat protection for the price!,"This was a great bag that we used for our most recent trips. The bag fits bigger carseats ( we have the Britax Marathon ) and you can even squeeze more stuff in it if your suitcase is over the weight limit as ours was! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's a tiny bit awkward for carrying and would be better with wheels. However, I think it's the best buy for the money and highly recommend it."
5,did the job,kept my carseat scratch free and intact when traveling with my toddler. Was a little hard to get it in cause of my bulky car seat but was able to get it in after a little struggle.
3,"Good protection for carseat, still tiring to lug around airport","Some good features are its durability, big size to fit even the britax marathon...does its purpose in protecting the car seat I think.I had a hard time putting the carseat into the bag because wasn't sure exactly which way fits the best. There's no like arrow or something pointing to which way the carseat should face in there. Also lugging it around the airport was quite tiring. Maybe we should have gotten the one with 2 straps like a backpack instead of just 1 that it has.I received the product 2 days earlier than expected which was great!"
1,Ripped During Its First Use - Before the Flight,"While the bag was spacious enough (and then some) to fit our Evenflo Big Kid DLX, disassembled, a seam tore when I was removing the bag from the trunk at the airport... before the flight. Given the known fact that baggage handlers are rough with luggage, my handling of the bag was 'with kid gloves' in comparison. Thankfully, I had a large safety pin in my luggage; however, this item was a disappointment and is not recommended. They should reinforce the seams better."
3,one okay other one not,"ordered two of these for our trip. one ripped the other one didn't. i've contacted sunshine kids to see if they will replace it, but have not heard back."
2,not so great,"We purchased this based on the positive reviews; however, we were surprised when we ended up with a hole after it's third flight. I don't know how much traveling people are doing with this, but after less than a year and 7 flights, I don't think we'll be able to use it again. It's ripping on a seam and the fabric is sporting several little holes."
3,Attention: Doesn't fit ALL carseats,I recently purchased 2 of these to fit my twins (1 yr olds) convertible car seats. I was really excited about these since we are going on our first plane ride with the kids and they seem to fit all carseats...or at least some of the reviews said they did. Unfortunately these did not fit my Graco My Ride convertible carseats. I tried putting them in all sorts of ways trying to get them to fit. Luckily I still have my infant seats that the kidos can still (barely) fit in or I would have had to send them back and use garbage bags to keep them from getting beat up at the airport. So I just want to warn anyone else with convertible seats or large carseats that they may not fit so check the dimensions before you purchase!
1,Quilted pillow protector,This protector is made with poor quality materials. The outer shell is very stiff and scratchy. The inner padding has already started to fall apart after only one washing. I don't think that this item will survive more than 10 washings. Don't buy this product it is not worth it.
4,Good - No Matter What You Call It,"Glancing at previous reviews, I see a few that are critical of the album for what it ain't when they should be judging it by what it is. I was looking for Amazing Grace when someone burned me a CD that contained many of the songs on this album and, based on that, I purchased it. It hasn't been out of my cd changer since I got it and I will frequently change back to this disc. It is the one disc that has remained, throughout the weekly swaps. I won't argue with its classification as rap as some have done. Whether it is or not is unimportant to me; my tastes are eclectic. I can't think of a single bad track on this album."
5,Everlast's best album,"If Dylan or Springsteen ever were a rapper, they would be Everlast. The former frontman of House of Pain has grown as a musician and also as a songwriter. This album is very personal. One subject that is repeated is lost love and the regrets of it. The rap songs are also great with acoustic guitar in the background. This Kind of Lonely samples I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry, the Hank Williams classic. Everlast makes it his own song. Favorites include Blinded by the Sun, Broken, White Trash Beautiful, Sleepin' Alone, The Warning, Angel, This Kind of Lonely, Soul Music, Lonely Road, Ticking Away, Pain, 2 Pieces of Drama, and Maybe. Highly Highly Recommended."
5,One of the most underrated musicians of our time.,"From his hip-hop early days to the current folk-rap style that he seems to have innovated, this is a solid album."
4,Everlast Fans,"Everlast's 1st cd Whitey Ford Sings the Blues,had hits like Ends,What it's like and a few others. It was a great cd in the acoustic sense, although i'm not too much on the rapping.His second cd Eat at Whiteys was a good follow up to Whitey Ford sings the blues. had a few radio singles, but didnt have the lasting power of songs like what it's like and ends.Now White trash beautiful is a good junior album with more mellow songs and more acoustic blues-rock sound. which i like alot more. stand -out songs on the cd are white trash beautiful, angel, blinded by the sun, and a more depressing broken. all in all if your an Everlast fan you need to get this cd i think it's better than his sophmore album Eat at whiteys.If your ever in a depressed mood or just looking for some good acoustic tracks, just listen to this cd. you wont be sorry."
2,"I liked it better when it was called ""Whitey Ford""","If you have any other Everlast albums, you have this one. Every song sounds like a story and often just gets really old after a minute or so. Sounds like the leftovers that wasn't quite good enough for previous albums. Predictable, but I found myself tapping my foot more than once. For hardcore Everlast fans. Not doing a song by song review, because then I would have to listen to it again."
3,Its an ok cd,This cd isn't horrible but its far from great too. Everlast needs to realize he doesn't have a great singing voice or song writing abilty so he'll never attract rock/blues fans he seems to go after on his last two albums. I do like alot or rock music and some hip hop but In my opinon everlast last is a much better MC than Folk/blues singer. Everlast should stick hip/hop/rock rock which. Most of his fans are from his house of pain days and like hip hop or hard rock.
2,As mediocre as I expected,"I didn't listen to all of Everlast's last album but I remember he had 2 or 3 great songs on there. This album lacks even 1 great song.The album isn't pitiful, it just not good enough to listen to more than once."
1,metallica masquerading as everlast,I would have liked to review the White Trash Beautiful release but I received a Metallica CD inside the White Trash Beautiful SACD case. WTF. And Amazon would not credit my account when I returned it. Probably because the case was opened. Duh.
3,the self-titled track has static,"Just one thing that really bothers me is that the self-titled song ""White Trash Beautiful"" has annoying background static within the first minute of the song, it gets progressively worse halfway through and continues all the way to the end. I guess that's what I get for grabbing the mp3 download version of the album. Otherwise its a pretty decent album, I would have given it higher rating if it didn't have that defect."
1,The Riddle,This movie was order incorrectly. The movie I wanted was called Riddle with Val Kilmer starring in it. I didnt like this movie. It was boring and didn't make much sense.. No action at all.
4,The Riddle,"The Riddle stars one of my favorite actors, Derek Jacobi, so I thought the movie was good, although as Brittish movies do, it was kind of choppy and hard to follow, and ended stupid. My rating of the site I got this movie from was 1st rate. It arrived in perfect condition, and the C.D. is great. I'd give them 5 stars, plus it was only a week or two in getting here. Thanks!!!!"
3,OK,"Other than the hot lead male actor I was sorta lost regarding this movie....Decent film. Again, lead actor kept me captivated not the plot."
4,Listen! (There's little to read),"This is a splendid collection, sung beautifully and with authority. The accompaniment, like a good official at a sports event, is essential to the performance, but unnoticed. Why four stars instead of five? There is no libretto, let alone a translation. If you aren't fluent in German, you can enjoy the music(!), but don't expect a message."
4,UFO Classic's Live,"A must for real UFO fans.Disc's #1&2 recorded on 1-28-98 in Vienna Austria are of superb sound quality. The boy's really hit their stride that night.The song's from Walk On Water,Self Made Man, and Venus really translate well on the live stage.The classic tracks such as Electric Phase,Natural Thing,and This Kids, really take me back to a time in my life which i will always treasure.Disc's #3&4 are of poor sound quality,but none the less it is classic UFO,and well worth the price"
3,"nice design, but faded","Happy with the design of the flag, but after only one week of being outside on the pole, and one rainstorm, the flag has faded considerably. The flag is still in good condition, just a very light red instead of the crimson color it should be."
1,Disapointing,It came with gems in it that didnot fit. So they would fall out. Couldnot use with the gems it came with. Checked the sizes several times to make sure it was the product and not me. Well it wasn't me. Should have spent a little more for a better one.
5,"The best pen for the money, or any money.",This pen writes beautifully. The weight is balanced; the body is slender but doesn't feel delicate. The nib is flexible but strong. It doesn't leak. I have pens that are more expensive about which the above is not true. This pen will make you start taking notes - and writing notes - again.
2,very hard to read,"interesting stuff but written not very well. reading this book makes me feel like eating dry sawdust. purchased ""shadows on the koyukuk"" by sidney huntington/jim rearden. oh boy - time flyes with this book! compare to marshalls sawdust this feels like juicy steak!"
3,"1/2 stars--Good Compilation, But Could Have Been Better","The Isley Brothers' entry into Rhino's popular BEDROOM CLASSICS series is essential because it focuses on the Isley's underrated Warner Brothers period from 1985 to 1992. Big points for including four songs from the Isleys classy 1985 album ""Masterpiece"", an album that has yet to see a cd release in the US. However, this isn't a perfect compilation. R&B hits ""Spend The Night"", ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" and ""Lost In Your Love"" are absent, while the timeless ""For The Love Of You"" is presented here as a 7"" single edit. And including the song ""Key To My Heart"" is pointless."
3,pretty good,"huge Isley Brothers fan&I enjoy all eras,though the 85-92 was hit&Miss at best.but tracks such as ""Smooth Saling"" are still cool. nice 7 edit of ""For the Love of you"".Sensetive Lover"" is cool. there are some good tracks here,but this collection on a whole is slightly better than Hit&Miss at best.trademark sound&Vocals."
2,Not what it seems,"This book should be called ""an walkthrough of a .NET application"".You cannot explain enterprise development by walking us through one application! They needed to explain why they have designed a component in a particular way, and possible alternatives for different scenarios.The books is basically a walkthrough of an application written by the authors. I was hoping for something along the lines of a discussion of designing an implementing enterprise applications.I think their data access mechanism is better than hard coding sql but I wouldn't use it in production. It is not a true object orientated persistence layer.However I rate this book 2 stars because their are some things that I gained from their example app. There are always things to learn from analyzing an application."
4,a surprisingly good book,"In spite of its small size, this book is surprisingly good. It is not all you will need to develop your ""next big thing"", but it points you in the right direction nevertheless.If you are about to develop your first big project (like me) and you need a relatively brief guide, this might be a book for you.And, contrary to what the other readers said about support, I didn't have any problems downloading the codes at all. In any case, I just downloaded the codes, so the previous problems encountered by other readers must have been addressed."
4,Location of example code,This is just a response to a previous post. The source code for this book is located at http://support.apress.com.
2,"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly","The Good: Great content. Focuses on high level design and implementation and leaves the nitty gritty details to a pre-coded object model. Geared more toward advanced enterprise developers who do not want to wade through boilerplate code.The Bad: A few typos and code example errors.The Ugly: Buyer Beware! Wrox seems to have abandoned this title. You cannot download any of the code samples, which makes the high level approach less appealing."
3,Decent Book but didn't live up to expectations,"I was looking for a .NET Enterprise book that would dive into lots of .NET Enterprise Architecture topics and material. This book does cover some .NET Enterprise Architecture topics but overall it just didn't meet my expectations. The book is a good walk through book that steps you through the authors development process of a .NET Enterprise level application, but it is not a hardcore .NET architecute book which I was hoping for."
2,Hard to get into,"I can usually get into her books without any trouble, This one was in the old days and I only read one chapter. Hopefully I can get back to it."
3,disappointed...,"I am disappointed with the size of this bag and also the feel of the fabric. For the price, I thought it would be more on par with an L.L. Bean duffel but it is not. The graphics are very cute, but I would not purchase this item again."
1,2nd time is a charm,"On the first try I got zero growth from my seeds. After a month of waiting with no avail, I contacted No Thyme Productions and requested another packet of seeds to try again. A few days later I got it in the mail and tried once more, and so far I do have seedlings. I can't tell you about the plant itself and its flavor yet. I will get back on that soon when I have my first sip of tea made with the Lemon Balm."
1,Didn't grow,"I ordered lemon balm for my Aerogarden (hydroponic systems) in June. I waited until November, then I call ""No Thyme Productions"" and told them this. They sent me a new packet. Again I tried to plant the seeds in my hydroponic system around December (I didn't plant them immediately as the Aerogarden was taken up by eggplant, which were delicious). Again, they didn't sprout. Now I am wondering whether or not it is too late to complain again."
3,New is not always better,"I would not recommend this version if you have not seen Riverdance before. Some of the scenes are ruined because of the almighty closeup. A good portion of the show is watching the dancers torso, not complete dancer, with feet moving. All you watch is their smiling face bobbing up and down. This version is also much slower then others I have seen; many slow songs and watching people playing musical instruments. I would only get this if you are collecting the different Riverdance shows. Buy Michael Flately's version if you are new to Riverdance. Lord of the Dance and Feet of Flames great."
3,How Did This Happen to RIVERDANCE?,"If you have followed RIVERDANCE seriously, this version will make you remember Moya Doherty's warning in A JOURNEY about crossing the line. What with the blinding entrance backlights, smoke machines, swaying hips, headset mics and the ugliest costumes this side of Vegas - the line is barely to be found in this tired, truncated incarnation.You should own it, however, for the inspired performance of the splendid Breandan de Gallai and for the American tap dancers."
2,Riverdance live from geneva,I happen to own this show on video. I can honestly say that pretty much everything is the same. There is nothing very special about this. I also own the first riverdance and the show done live in new York city. I like those shows better. If I were to own this on DVD I would not watch any of it. I consider this version of the show to be a bit boring. The music as well as the dancing are pretty much the same.
2,A must pass for true fans.,"I have loved Riverdance since the first time I saw it on PBS. I could wait till I received my Riverdance: Live from New York DVD so many years ago. Recently, I had a chance to see it on tour when it came to Los Angeles. I had been waiting for that moment so long and it was everything I could hope for (with the exception of them having removed the song ""Home in the Heartland"" which any ture fan knows brought the story full circle). That night, I ordered not only Riverdance: Live from Geneva, but also Jean Butler's Irish Dance DVD (Which I would recommend). To make a long story short, don't waste your time with this version of the show. The main female singer is absolutely horrible (Definitely doesn't hold a candle to Katie MacMahon's original vocals), and the lead female dancer's too short hair drove me crazy. Do yourself a favor and purchase the 1999 DVD Live from New York. I promise you won't be disappointed."
4,Great dancing but the lead female singer needs to go!,"I bought this DVD and enjoy it tremendously, the only problem is that the lead female singer? She takes the haunting, dreamy melodies that are beautiful in every other version of the show, and turns them into ear-pierceing, cringe-worthy caricatures of the original. It leads to a terrible experience for the viewer! In contrast, the male lead singer has a gorgeous voice, its just unfortunate that he was paired up with that singer."
1,"Ducks in a shooting gallery, you are the duck,","Poorly designed campaign and scenario setup. Each one starts with the enemy knowing exactly where you are. If they havent already opened fire, they will in a few moments. There are far too many neutral ships & planes around and near your force. Hit one and you lose a lot of points. Problem is you have to seperately identify them because at the start of each campaign you don't know who they are. (how realistic is that??) You can't change the weapons load on the planes which means if you use a US aircraft carrier, you have a grand total of 4 strike planes. You have to get the update from Janes website to allow your ships to do things like engage missiles automaticaly."
5,If you can only read one book on the subject....,"Far and away the best written, clearest, and easiest to follow book on the subject. If you only have time for one book on this subject , this is the only one you need. ""Enterprise Knowledge Management"" by Loshin is great, but more technical."
2,Not helpful for small business,"This book, while well intentioned, is not great for a small business audience. The book assumes you are working in a large scale environment where one person's job is to focus on data quality. If you wear more than one hat in your job many of the approaches are simply not practical in this book as their return on investment would not be worth the effort to implement.This might be excellent for Fortune 500 companies, but for smaller shops this book will not push you very far solving problems on a day to day basis."
5,The Best Data Quality Book in the Marketplace,"This book is the clearest, most practical book on data profiling and data quality that I have seen. Jack breaks down data quality issues into specific categories, and leaves you with a vision of what to do if you are building a data warehouse. His practical experience shows through very clearly and he talks to the IT developer (the reader) very effectively.This book is on my very short list of essential reading for data warehouse professionals."
2,A real good one,"Yep, a real good show. No palaver here, folks. And I'm not just being urbane about this. This is real good. And I should know, because... eh, I can't do this anymore. The charade is over."
3,"Ricky Skaggs's ""Highways & Heartaches""","Ricky's CDs are always tight. The musianship was first rate and without flaw, but it isn't Bluegrass as I see it. I should have sampled it before buying, because I was expecting a hard driving bluegrass version of ""Can't You Hear Me Calling'?""Highways & HeartachesHowever, when he plays with Kentucky Thunder, it is Bluegrass turned up to eleven."
3,A decent text book,"This book was required for an information systmems class. It was a decent read, but I felt that it was lacking in technical aspects."
3,Gentle cleanser does not remove makeup,"This cleanser is wonderfully gentle and soothing for my sensitive, mildly-pink skin (rosacea), but it did absolutely nothing to remove facial makeup, even after three times trying. I'd consider using it just for mornings, but it's a bit too pricey for that, and I prefer to use as few products on my skin as possible.That said, this cleanser did not irritate my skin or turn it red, so it is an excellent option for Rosies. I did not use the wipe-off option because wiping a cotton pad across my skin is irritating, but it rinsed relatively easily.If you don't wear makeup and you have sensitive, dry skin, this would be a a very gentle cleanser, but I wear makeup, and the cleanser was too gentle to take off my face! I prefer Boscia MakeUp-BreakUp Cool Cleansing Oil, which cleanses (even eye makeup) and moisturizes in one step, even my oily T zone, with no need for toner afterward."
5,excellent for rosacea,"Would love to have a pump foaming cleanser but my favorite, Skin Effects for Sensitive Skin, is no longer available. Tried a few new ones, including Aveeno Ultra Calming - all of them caused an immediate reaction. Toleriane is the only one that didn't irritate my skin. It's also great at not drying out my skin and leaving that tight feeling along with flaking skin. Skin is nicely softened in addition to being clean. I've got dry to normal skin, not sure how this would be for oily skin. If you suffer from rosacea and have trouble finding products that don't cause a flare up, I highly recommend trying this one. Much more expensive than the Skin Effects I used to buy at CVS, but worth it to prevent the dreaded red bump breakouts! I follow it up with metrogel 1% (only at night). Seems to be working."
3,feel oil after washing your face,"I have a oil combination skin, after using it, it gives you a kind of feeling that you would never clean up your face. too oil for me."
4,Pretty good,"Gentle and mild, not overly impressive. Good for those with pretty agreeable skin. I didn't feel like it was good for a makeup remover, which was disappointing for the price/brand."
2,Didn't clean my skin,"This cleanser was gentle, but it didn't clean my skin very well, which led to breakouts. My skin looks worse than before using it, even though I had been using a much harsher cleanser. I wiped my skin with toner after washing with this, both at the sink and in the shower, and more makeup came off on the cotton ball. I'm disappointed; I've heard good things about this line. I may try another."
2,Button rattles,"The on/off button on the mike rattles audibly. Since that is where the mike is... it picks it up loudly. It bothered me. Then I had a listener say it was hurting their ears. I obtained a brand new Jabra Earbud and it had the identical problem. I returned it again and have not come back. Jabra's appear to be nice, but not the earbud with the button near the mike."
2,one phone call only,"Worked beautifully the first phone call and after that, kaput! It started shorting out and then wouldn't work at all--and I promise I didn't bang it around or do anything out of the ordinary to it."
1,A piece of junk,"I have had the opportunity to try the Jabra unit and several others that were considerably cheaper. The one thing I cannot get over with the Jabra is how lousy the sound is compared to that of the JVC TF-HF20. The Jabra unit sound borders on almost unusable!!! I do like the ""jelly"" insert and the ability to use the earpiece without having to clip on the wire but the speaker is of such a poor quality that it ruins overall sound beyond anything else I have heard. Would definitely not recommend (unless you like a ""muddy"" sound)."
2,"Pleasant, but not memorable...","Yvonne Elliman has a smooth voice and delivery, and her rendition of the Eagles' ""Best of My Love"" is a treat. But aside from this and her big hit ""If I Can't Have You,"" there's just not much to recommend here. It's not that the collection is ""bad,"" it's just not memorable, and the songs - particularly the latter ones on this CD - just don't stay with you."
4,Veneer Edging,Applies good and looks great. There is enough of it for most edging and I can't forsee any problems with it.
4,Rodney Toady Vs. Tommy the Pinball Wizard,"I'm a huge Syd Barrett follower, and I don't really hear the resemblance to Syd here, or I have to strain to hear it. It reminds me more of the Who's Tommy, only with Robert Fripp's style of guitar playing. I dare say Rodney Toady could beat Tommy in a fight, if Tommy didn't have his disciples and his holiday camp to fight for him. I haven't laughed so much in quite a while, and I've laughed a lot listening to this. The pauses in the narrative of Rodney Toady in mid-sentence are just so awkward and subtle and ingenious, for instance.It's nothing like King Crimson, which makes one think that King Crimson may well be as Robert Fripp says a way of doing things rather than a band with Robert Fripp in it. Comparing this to something like King Crimson's Red is like comparing night to day, and it is in no way as deep, piercing and dramatic as In The Court Of the Crimson King."
5,Wonder Worlds of Words and Walls of Sounds,"This is so much fun. Of course, I was listening to this album as soon as I discovered King Crimson. I invite you to listen to Peter Sinfield's Illisions, and all the others related to K.C. This is a prelude to Mr. Fripp's continuing journey. Great fun indeed."
4,Cheerfully recommended....,"A fascinating pre-cursor (by only about a year's time) to the greatest art-rock statement ever, ""In The Court Of The Crimson King"". Robert Fripp and Michael Giles present a sneak peek at the upcoming work with the ethereally beautiful ""Erudite Eyes"", which features a ""Moonchild"" style melody which transforms into a loose prog-rock-jazz jam at the end. The upcoming collaboration with lyricist Pete Sinfield is also previewed in ""Under The Sky"". And, yes, there are the ""silly"" numbers such as ""The Elephant Song"" and ""Digging My Lawn""... but they are as endearingly ""English"" as the slice-of-British-life ditties perpetuated from the Kinks and Moody Blues in the 60's all the way through Martin Newell and XTC in the present day! Recommended for fans of early Crimson (or even Dukes of Stratosphere!)."
3,This became King Crimson?,"It's really hard to believe this was the beginning of King Crimson. The music is very poppish, but diverse. One second it sounds like the Beach Boys (well an English version anyways), the next it is the Moody Blues (or Gerry & the Pacemakers or something vaguely recognizable) and the next it is self-mocking in a Bonzo Dog Band kind of way. It is really sort of innocent fun with some sinister undertones. There is a running dialogue between the songs that was probably unique in its time, but is now sort of distracting (and poor Rodney is just such a pathetique charactor). While I got this one merely for history (this is how King Crimson started etc.) I find this to be a guilty pleasure. There is just something infectous about these songs, although they are clearly centered around british pop music in the late 60s."
1,Ouch,"They really hurt. I've never had sneakers that hurt, but somehow these do. The back of my ankle gets rubed and I get red and sore. Stinks because I really think they are cute. Also even though my feet are very tiny...the vencro hardly reaches far enough to close. Maybe if you tape up your ankle it won't hurt as much."
5,Beginning XML Hooray!,"This is one of the best reference manuals I have ever read (and I've read lot's of them!!!!). I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn, or may already know XML. Lot's of relevant information in an easy to follow format. Good Job, David hunter and friends!"
2,Riddled With Errors,"Was this book written in a day? Syntax errors, spelling errors, and general misinformation abound. Perhaps the author intended readers to learn XML by debugging his examples?"
1,Please think before you buy.,"Unlike most Wrox books, this one is very confusing. The topics are scattered everywhere and you have to look all over the place to get an idea of what is going on. For beginners, get Microsoft or xml by example than go straight to Professional XML. Skip this one, it will only confuse you."
4,Solid Intro to XML and related technologies,"Having worked with XML for over a year, I was skeptical when a colleague recommended this book as an introduction for XSLT. But, I found it an excellent read. Using this book, I've built a small portal framework that uses XML and XSLT to seperate the logic and presentation layers. I also took the time to read the rest of the book and found it accurate and clear. Especially the part about namespaces.Now, if Wrox would just do something about these ugly covers! I'll look in a mirror when I want to see a computer geek. :-)"
4,Good book yet a little confusing,"This book is a good introduction book on XML subject. I started reading this book with little knowledge about XML, and after completing it I felt I learned a lot. Yet this book is a little confusing at the beginning. I finished the first 9 chapters and really got very confused. Then I revisited the topics and got many problem clarified. The support for this book is very good, I sent the support team a few e-mails and got responses very quickly."
3,Good Book but too large,"This a very good for the beginners , however , I think the whole material can be a lot compacted and the book can be of 300-400 pages instead of 800 pages and would have given the same information.Any way it atleast worth one reading for the guys who have just started learning xml."
3,Good book leads me to understand very deeply,"When I start with XML, I don't even know what that is, I have the basic knowledge of HTML, and a little bit about Basic, right now, I'm being able to write my own dynamic website by using XML. It is very understandable. It's worth it to buy it."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING ME?,The price is ridiculous you can buy similar item at catalogfavorites.com . It's called Ballerina Dance With Me DollCost $24.95!
2,Put Your Money Towards Something Better,"Although I didn't buy this from Amazon - a friend gave it to me when she got a better juicer - I've used enough to let everyone know that this isn't a great choice. It juices quickly and is fairly easy to clean, but it doesn't extract as much juice as it should. The pulp is quit wet and I do run it through the feeder to squeeze a little more out. It you want to see if juicing is for you though and don't want to spend alot of $$$, this may be worth a try. But I guarantee that if you are serious about juicing, you'll be moving onto a better juicer!"
3,Certification book,"If you begin with FCP or if you don't have too much time available, I am not sure if this book is for you. Tips/advice could be better displayed and sometimes, this is a little bit confusing. If you are looking for a specific information, be prepared to loose time to find it.However the CD helps and tons of pictures illustrate the step by step moves. It takes 40-50 hours to cover all exercices and if you go step by step you should be ok. But this is time consuming!It may be good book if you have to pass the Apple certification."
3,"Decent Info, but only useful with the lesson files.","Had to buy this book for a class. We utilize the lesson files included and they are fairly helpful, but it's impossible to study from this book for quizzes and such. There isn't really any content to the book other than a guide to going through the lesson files. I don't see the need for them to physically print the book at all, it would have been more useful just on a DVD. Don't purchase this book if you're looking for a reference guide to turn back to, it's not terribly useful in that respect."
4,Final Cut Pro 5 - Training Series (Used Book),This was an Amazon Verified Purchase. It is an older training book for use with an older version of Final Cut Pro. I was surprised to find it on Amazon. It arrived in great condition and promptly. It even still had the DVD enclosed as indicated. This was an excellent experience.
4,Good tool for learning,"Book is very comprehensive, covers topics in depth and allows the reader to work through projects. Final Cut is quite a program, and to try to learn about it on your own would be a challange, this book bridges the gap.Not once could I complete the project tasks in the estimated time given, i.e. 1 hour, I don't know if I am the only one who can't pick it up as quick as the book says, for me personally the concept of completing the book in the time stated is unrealistic, nevertheless I got it eventually and now have a much broader understanding of the program, so in this sense I found it useful and it has fulfilled it's purpose as a learning tool."
4,One of the better training books out there.,"I was very happy with this training book. I was semi-proficient with final cut in general and this really helped me move to the next stage of my learning. I find myself being able to do more creative things with the Final Cut program because of this book. I strongly recommend this guide, even if you have been working with Final Cut for years."
5,Hmm..........,"I've edited a number of Powell's books -- and this is one of her best (although not quite on a level with ""Turn, Magic Wheel,"" ""A Time To Be Born,"" or ""Come Back To Sorrento."")I did find it a little amusing to read the review of my supposed ""introduction"" to this edition, and to find it called ""vague"" and ""anemic."" It's actually much worse than that -- as I wrote no introduction to ""The Golden Spur"" whatsoever!Note to budding critics -- it's always a good idea to read a book before printing a review."
3,"worth a ""light"" read","Read this after reading Gore Vidal's essay about her & finished a little disappointed. She writes first-rate prose (a perfect sentence-writing clinic, I found myself re-reading passages & marveling at her craft) & is very funny, but every character seems mades of cardboard. The constant cynical wit can be tiring & stubborn & (as the reviewer below notes) everything is thrown together at the end, seemingly because she just felt like stopping the story. I guess I wanted to know more... I'll probably try another one of her books though."
1,Intensely irritating,"A collection of short essays, most of which consist of little more than psychobabble. Get it through the public library - don't buy it."
1,Almost totally lacking any redeeming value,"I got this book some time back and just cannot stand it. I'm not a Monarchist but from what I did get through of this book it is just plain mean. The general tone is as the subtitle says, irreverant. From one end to the other the writers spend their time denigrating the Princess as well as the Royal family, showing no liking or even respect for anyone. It seems to me to be a compilation of hatred or at least lack of respect for the subject and those who have any sort of interest and/or respect for the British Royal family and their way of life."
2,boring.,This book is really boring. The only cool thing about it was that it referenced my teacher who taught my class. Other than that I thought it was mind-numbingly awful.
1,NO BOOK!!!!,I HAVE CONTACTED THIS SELLER 3 TIMES. NO RESPONSE. I'M FILING A CLAIM AND A COMPLAINT. !!! I CAN'T EVEN SAY HORRIBLE SERVICE....NO SERVICE AT ALL.
3,Second trip to Tyler is more sweet than it is suspenseful.,"When Patrick Kelsey learns that it is a woman who will replace the retired coach instead of him he is not too pleased. But when he sees that Pam Casals has the right stuff for the job the man changes his tune and quick. But Pam does have some troubles, the least of which is her attraction to Patrick. Pat Warren's sophomore entry in the tapestry that is the Tyler Saga is a sweet and easy read. The only real shortcoming of the book is the clumsy murder sub-plot which feels out of place, the events having no real connection with the Casals/Kelsey romance. Recommended."
3,Older issue but still in good shape.,This book has been around for a while . One of the original releases. I was happy to get it though.
3,Bright Hopes,"Sure, it was better than the first in the series (Whirlwind). And maybe I'm biased, knowing this book is like fifteen years old. But I really thought it could be better... I mean, I'm sure people liked it then, but if I pick up an old book I expect it to be realistic, no matter when it was written. And I seriously doubt that the dialogue is realistic, even for 1992. I mean, guys just don't talk like that.Still, I give Pat Warren credit, since this was better than Whirlwind by a mile."
3,Kipnis needs to slow down,"This is a beautiful recording but Igor Kipnis needs to slow down. He plays the short, easy keyboard pieces as fast as he can and with strange trills and extra notes. The rhythms are wierd too. I liked this recording but could have liked it better if Igor Kipnis did not ruin it with his wierd playing."
2,Stories are universal,"I am a New Zealander and I heard Thomas King on the radio as he presented the Massey lectures this year. His words resonated with me even though his stories are not from my land. The pain of indigienous people and the stories of suffering that continues long after colonisation are heard in many countries of the world. King's stories express pain, but also hope, grief, but also joy. He is an extraordinary storyteller and as I read I can hear his voice reaching out, asking for a greater understanding and respect for the lives of people, and the well-being of the planet."
4,A comprehensive book for the advanced hobby gardener,"This book gives a good overview for a hobby gardener who wants to know more about Camellias. Trehane deals in the first chapters with the history of Camellias and their ""botanical context"" and provides on about 50 pages everything a non-specialist needs to know. The next chapter, about as long, summarizes all necessary information regarding cultivation. Further sections are the use of Camellias in the garden, 3 pages with hintes how to exhibit Camellias, 13 pages about pests and diseases. Finally Trehane introduces a selection of popular Camellias (35 pages). The book concludes with some useful addresses. This book is not an encyclopedia with rich illustrations, but it is helpful and useful for a gardener who tries to learn more about Camellias and to grow them successfully."
5,A Useful Academic Tool,I work as a private tutor and ordered this text in order to help my student keep up with his studies. The condition of the text is better than the texts we have in our classroom at school and the price was very affordable. Having a copy of the text that he can write in and take notes in has been a valuable tool in maintaining his academic progress.
1,****BEWARE**** You don't get what u purchased,My order arrived today. It was supposed to be a TWIN PACK but I only received one. I guess the fact that it was the right filter is somewhat consoling (but it was the regular type not the super one). I would not order again.
3,A Highly Overrated Movie,"Way overrated, a fair movie but only reason is the special effects the first half-an-hour is boring, and there are parts of this movie that are so cheesy it makes you want to cringe in horror. The plot is about a guy who goes to the magical world of Wu Mountain and who is crazy about this girl.my recommendation - watch this movie don't but it"
4,Dated but worthwhile if you can pick it up cheap,"I got mine for $5.99 at a ""Building #19"" store in MA. Although it's quite dated (J2EE 1.3 - EJB 2.0, JSP 1.2 and Servlet 2.3) there's not been too many changes to J2EE 1.4 (1.5 though is a whole different matter with annotations and the ""back-to-POJOs"" approach). I'd still pick up a copy if you can get it cheap and before J2EE 1.5 goes mainstream."
3,"Two steps forward, One step backward","This is overall a good book. The earlier version of the same book was better because it had more diagrams, more examples, more chapters, etc. This book lacks the meat contained in the previous version, including fewer pages and smaller font size. Don't know why these enlightened authors have taken this step... So, think twice before you buy this book..."
1,A wounderful book to impress others,This book did not proved to be to helpful as it does not give examples and contains many minor mistakes you will first discover when actually working with the stuff. There are much better books around that have the disadvantage of not looking so nice red and have no photos on the cover. After using some stuff I saw that some samples were just copied from other sides where they also not worked.Nice in the shelf if you need to fill it!
3,"Don't buy from the ""Bargain Price"" listing.","This product listing does not allow normal sellers to list their item here. Thus, the prices for this book are higher than they should be, because a few preferred sellers are able to monopolize the listing. If you want to buy this book, click on the ""other offers"" link below the usual ""used & new link"". Normal sellers are selling the same book for a lot cheaper."
3,Very detailed but very dry,"This book explain almost every single detail of J2EE, but it was written in a very dry manner. After read through chapteres on JSP and Servlet, I was dryed up and eventually switch to ""Mastering EJB"" written by Ed Roman."
4,Kids and Adults Can Enjoy,"The game can go a little long sometimes for my attention span. It is easy and fun, though. It is a good game for kids to start to learn some basic strategy. And the cards are definitely interesting!"
2,Disappointed!!,"First of all, great classic live album... BUT where are the bonus tracks from the rest of the show(s)?! All of these versions have been released before. There is surely space because this is spread out over 2 CD's. That might have justified the $43.00 price tag. The diehard fans need more!!! C'mon Coverdale!!!! By the way, the new Whitesnake sucks!"
5,Hiking Marin one of the best local guides ever!,"Wonderful guide for the Marin hiker. Book describes parking for trail heads, elevation changes, terrain, degree of difficulty, as well as what you can expect to see on the hike seasonally. Book is cleverly organized by area and/or what you are after in a hike --- wildflowers, wildlife, waterfalls and panoramas. Locations for along or near trails are also included. Great buy for veteran hikers looking for new areas to explore, or for newcomers to the area trying to figure out where to start on all the great trails available in Marin."
4,Begginers,"This Book is excellent, It also gives you the beggings of the snowboard and it is good for beginners. With good pictures and layout i would recommend this to others.. )"
5,"Awesome ladder, but heavy!","I bought this ladder so that I could clean the gutters on my house. They are high, and a 40 footer is required. The ladder is of great quality, very sturdy. It is heavy, and a bit of a challenge to carry around by myself, much-less to stand up against the house. Once it is vertical, it is tricky to move around to lean over, and care must be taken not to loose control. If would really be best to have several guys to manhandle this ladder, and should not be attempted by one person. I did use this ladder to cut a neighbor's tree, and it was very handy to be able to climb way up to get access to the top of the tree. Did I ever clean the gutters? No. The ladder was plain too heavy for me to use it. However, the ladder does come apart in 2 sections, and they can be used individually a bit more easily.So yes, it is a great ladder, and is an awesome choice if you need to get up 40 feet. But, if you don't need to go that high, a lighter smaller ladder would be a better choice."
1,Still a fan after all these years,Hmmmm no so good. Obviously a VERY early attempt. Starts off good in the first few chapters but DRAGS horribly after that.
4,Despite age holds it's ground. Worthwhile read.,"Managed to debate the ongoing question, religion or science, while not losing itself in old technology. Frank Herbert had few equals in his time."
2,A hard slog.,"This isn't an enjoyable read.The book has plenty of good ideas and the pace is good but the dialogue is incredibly dull, the discussions of consciousness mixed with mathematics and theology completely fail to be interesting.There is an awful lot of dialogue in the book and since that fails to hold your attention the book as a whole also fails.The ideas are good enough to save it from being a one star but it's very disappointing.I loved The Jesus Incident but, for a change, the sequel is much better than the first book."
2,Boring,"An ontological tour de force, where both the question and the answer only works within the boundaries of the novel's miniature universe. It would've been great to see it at least try to reflect on some of the major philosophical works dealing with the human soul, existence and consciousness, but to me it remained an enclosed and somewhat boring thought experiment only - carefully built up toward the final Chekhov's gun solution."
2,Not Herbert's best,"I am in general a fan of Herbert's writing, and sought out and bought this book since it contained the story leading up to The Jesus Incident.Herbert tends to idealize his characters' observational abilities. In this book, however, he takes it a bit far in the sense that he lets the characters read from each others' body language and behaviour things that simply cannot be deduced from those contexts in such a way. A bit too far towards mind-reading, in my opinion; it continually broke off my identification with the characters and thus made the book appear very fragmented.Frank Herbert is none the less intriguing to read, so while this book would deserve a mere 1 on a Herbert 1-5 scale, it gets a 2 on a more general scale.If I was to finish this off as the review I would have liked to read before reading the book, I would say: ""Drop reading this book, and go right on to The Jesus Incident. The Jesus Incident is fully independent of Destination Void."""
2,"Maybe I didn't ""get"" this book, but I sure didn't like it.","I found the opening pages of this book absolutely captivating. I couldn't wait to see the devious tribulations Moonbase had in store for the Umbilicus Crew.Unfortunately, the setup was the end of the good times. What followed was, to me, a lot of incoherent babble; endless nonsense about computers and consciousness, and all of it couched in the most impenetrable kind of Herbert-ian drug-trip tone-poem prose.Frank Herbert was obviously a very talented and smart man. Smarter and more talented than I, to be sure. Maybe I am just dumb or merely disinterested in the subjects in question, but I was not at all entertained by the bulk of this story. I just couldn't wait for it to be over.""Hellstrom's Hive,"" ""Whipping Star,"" ""The Heaven-Makers""...even ""The Green Brain"" were better, in my opinion. I say: pass!"
5,Amazing,"This is such a unique book and totally unlike anything I've ever read before (or since).This is the beginning of (IMO) the best F.Herbert series written.If you like science fiction, math, logic, and the philosophy of the origins of religion in stories, you'll like this."
5,Destination Void,"I am a long term fan of Frank Herbert (and his son), and have read almost every Dune book they have written. Destination Void was a new experience for me. It was well-written, full of suspense and surprises. It was a total joy to read, and opened up a new side of Frank Herbert that I fully intend to explore."
1,Destination: Avoid,"What a disappointment.This is a boring book about annoying people sent on an inscrutible mission to achieve an incomprehensible goal. It is a very difficult read, the plot and motivations of the characters are never adequately explained, and it is full of scientific and mathematical detail that may well be fascinating to scientists and mathematicians but serves only to muddle and confuse the story even further for the rest of us. There is no payoff at the end, which is as unexplained as the rest of the book.Reading this book is a complete waste of time. There is enough fascinating and wonderful science fiction out there about the nature of consciousness and computer intelligences in deep space (Vernor Vinge's ""A Fire Upon the Deep,"" for example) that skipping ""Destination: Void"" can hardly be considered a loss."
1,Terrible!!,"This is not a story. This is a discussion of what an artificial intelligence computer should be like. There is absolutuley no progression of events, no new ideas, and the ending is a farce. It is a complete waste of time to read this book."
4,"If you are interested in Tiger history , , , , , , ,","My brother-in-law is a sports fantantic. He once worked front office for the Detroit Tigers baseball team. His wife thought this would be a terrific book for his recent birthday. Although, I have not heard from him since he received the gift, I believe he enjoyed the book."
2,i was expecting more!,"I love the distress ink pads so I thought this powder was as good as those, but the result is relief as wet sand, is not as beautiful as I imagined."
5,a must-read for any child,"when i was 7 years old, my mother gave me this set for hanukah. i remember being disappointed to get books instead of toys, and after making a token attempt at reading the first one i let them sit on my shelf for a few years. several years later, having discovered a love of reading, i picked them up again and wow, what was i thinking? these have become some of my favorite books of all time. unfortunately when i was in high school i let myself get talked into selling them at a garage sale, a fact which, 6 years later, i completely regret! yes, i am 23 years old, and i loved these books so much that i am buying myself another set. you never are too old to read these books."
4,"A classic to read yourself, and to your children.",LOVED the books. Timeless classics to be enjoyed by children and parents again and again; with values as relevant for today as when they were written. Great value for money and attractively presented.
3,would be five stars,"ok. i love the books. i knew that before i bought them, having read them as a kid. but i hate the covers. i miss the ones i had as a kid (that my parents gave to some destructive cousins when they decided i was too old to want them still)"
5,Little house on the prairie,"Great service, item arrive without fuss and earlier than expected.ThanksChris"
2,Don't waste your money,"The books look to be in decent condition, but don't bother paying to have them gift wrapped. The paper was torn, and I had to wrap it again to make it look presentable."
5,Little House on the Prairie book set,"Excellent books, just as good as the TV ssies or better, very interesting as it shows thew way people lived in the 1800s and their values, gives a very clear picture of those years. A highly reccommended set of books"
5,thanks!,It is great! The package has come quicker than I was thinking and the books are perfect.Thank you very much.Genevieve CAUSSE
5,Little House Books,The Complete Little House Nine-Book SetI purchased this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves the Little House series and LOVES the books. GREAT set for any fan of any age!
4,A must read for any childhood...,"Laura Ingalls' series of novels based on her childhood in the 1800s is one of the most amazing works of literature ever compiled. I think that every child should have the opportunity to read this series. And it's not too late for adults, either. Though the writing is somewhat simple, anyone can enjoy the characters and the adventures of this brave pioneer family. The amazing thing is how much you can learn from these books. History truly comes alive."
2,The books fell apart,Bought the collection for my wife to read. One of the books literally fell apart when the backing became separated from the pages. My wife was left with a stack of pages. Yes she did lay the book down flat with it open but since it was a brand new book being read for the first time it was very disappointing to see it fall apart.Jim
2,"Printing Errors Bad, Stories Good!","While I loved the books as a child, and I purchased them for my family to read, there is a printing error in this edition, now had two replacement copies shipped, with the same error.In ""On the Banks of Plum Creek"", page order goes 152, 155, 156, 153, 154, 157; this occurs again on page 160 (jumps to 163), 168 (jumps to 171), 176, and so on.Again, the series and content cannot besmirched; the printing errors are the sole reason for anything less than a 5 star review."
4,great books,reading this with my son. This captures americana and our history. wonderful way to share history with my son and compare is life to not sooooo long ago
2,"Well written, amusing in places, but. . .","the depiction of Native American issues makes them inappropriate. Wilder glosses over the ill treatment of the orignial inhabitants of the land that made it possible for her family to settle in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Kansas, the Dakotas, etc. They waded to their new lives through the blood of the slaughtered along the trail of broken treaties. The author wasn't a stupid woman; she knew all this, yet she deliberately repressed it. Had she been honest enough to deal with it, I might recommend the books. As it is, they are racist trash and deserve to fall into oblivion."
5,Little House on the Prairie,"At age 72 I have read all nine books in the Laura series and have enjoyed every one of them! Even though they were written earlier than my times, I enjoy reading about things that I remember from my childhood. I am now reading the Rose series and they are just as interesting."
5,The Complete Little House Nine-Book Set,My Granddaughter is in fifth grade. She read one of the Little House books and loved it and wants to read the series for AR credit at school. Her twin brother has started reading them and also wants to finish the series for AR (Accelerated Reading). This series is of interest to both boys and girls. These books were on their school list.
5,Love these books!,"I'm lousy at reviews, but my kids and I always watched Little House on the Prairie when they were little. I've read this series of books several times and always enjoy them! It's a little bit of history wrapped up in an interesting story. :)"
2,Cheap Printing,"I'm thrilled to have a complete set for my daughter, but was GREATLY disappointed by the quality of the printing. The set came with a flimsy cardboard box easily bent. The paper is cheap, and the printing on each page is off-center so that there is a tiny margin at the top and a large margin on the bottom. If I thought it would make a difference to exchange it, I would, but I suspect others would be just the same.This was a purchase I bought with the anticipation that my daughter would have it for a lifetime. Had I been able to inspect prior, I would have sought out a much higher quality printing and would absolutely have passed on this one."
4,The little House Collection,"Books came as ordered, early -- they are a beautiful set and EXACTLY what my 9 year old daughter wanted. I had this same set as a child myself and I wish I had saved it for my daughter."
5,Very good package...,This package contains all 9 books of the series. The package itself looks very nice. A well worth buy for the dedicated fans of the series.
5,Little House on the Prairie series,It is a great book set to read with your young children. Our boys are 8 and 6 and love to sit on their daddy's lap to read at night.
5,Marvelous for childeren,This is a marvelous book for people of all ages but I highly recomend it for childeren. The stories are intriging and incourage reading. If you love autobiographys and biographys you'll love this book
3,Little House in the Big Woods,"Good for the price. Thicker books, larger print and coarser paper than I would have liked. Can't tell from the images before buying. Dimensions may help. I would like some indication on the above qualities before purchase as I was prepared to pay more for the quality I preferred. Postage very prompt. Overall happy with the purchase."
5,Laura,Great series of books. I needed it for my Classic books collections. I've been looking at them for years and finally got them.
5,Little house booki set,Gift for my 7 yr old granddaughter who owns one of the series and enjoyed reading it. The set looks nice and should offer a lot of good reading
5,Excellence of heritage,Condition was sweet and excellent my granddaughter is loving little house on the prairie with her dad! Soon little sister will be joining them!!
5,Better then Expected,I remember having this book set as a child. Came in GREAT shape and MUCH faster then expected.Very happy with this purchase.
5,Great Collection,I bought this as a gift for my niece. I loved these books when I was her age and I am excited that she gets to experience them now. She is looking forward to reading these. It is the complete collection in paperback and is a very good price.
4,Nice set of Little House books!,Books are fantastic as far as good chapter books for girls. The set itself is nice but I wish the book covers and case were of a better quality. They won't hold up long even with normal use.
5,Little House books,"This product came quickly (within the week) and in very good condition, look hardly used. I love the box set and have it set up in our guest bedroom, it is pretty. And, I have already read through half the books, they are exceptional. I would recommend both the seller and the Little House books (box set) to everyone! Thanks for all of your help! Shannon"
1,It is a very poor quality set.,"For the price I paid, I was expecting a little better quality than this.It was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter. I was kind of shame to give this as a gift."
5,Replacement For the Set That was ruined by Hurricane Ike,"I had purchased this set from CROSSINGS (a Christian Book Club), back in 2003. It was ruined by a Hurricane. I's everything the original set was."
5,Great books!,"My daughter loves these books. She likes the different focus of each book. Some of the words are a little outdated, but are easily figured out."
5,Never too old for these books!,"These books are a treasure, buy them and pass along to others.A great way to spend winter, reading them for yourself, your children or grandchildren."
5,Bought for my 8 year old daughter,"This was, and still is, one of my favorite set of books. I bought them for my daughter and she is enjoying reading them out loud to me now. It's been fun discussing how much different life was ""back then""."
5,Very pleased with this book set.,I purchased this set for my granddaughter's 10th birthday. She had previously read a couple of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books and asked for more for her birthday. She LOVED the set and began reading them immediately.
2,"Far from ""good"" condition","I purchased this book to get a head start on a spring class. The seller listed the condition as ""good"", which is the condition I generally prefer if not ""like new"". In ""good"" condition I generally expect the outside with little if any wear and the pages with minimal writing or highlighting (I don't think I'm asking for too much). The seller didn't offer any other comments other than ""good"" condition and they had good reviews so I didn't think I would be dissatisfied. There is extensive writing between the text lines, not as much highlighting and the corners are worn down. I wont forget to mention the spine is also in poor condition and taped. I can't return it because I honestly need it but if these things would have been mentioned I would not have spent the $44.00 at the most it's in faire condition and more appropriate to sell between $20.00-$30.00."
1,Not a chance,"Go buy ""European Air War"" by Microprose. If you value substance over style, the superficial and boring ""WW2 Fighters"" will NOT keep you interested."
4,This is an excellent flight sim,"This is one of the top flight simulator games, with first rate graphics, and good modeling of the various airplanes' flight characteristics.I think I've tried them all since the old 1942, with it's carrier aircraft that stalled as soon as you pulled their noses up, to Sturmovik, and this ranks among the top 4 or 5 in my book.I'm a former pilot, and have flown the real thing. I enjoyed this one very much.Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret.)author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenanceand other books"
5,Best Ever!,"This is my favorite game out there. Super and totaly cool graphics, the best crashes I've ever seen and you get to go deer hunting!! (Buy the game and land on a sheet of ice you'll see what i mean) Shootin at deers with bullets this size is fun!! but, Crashes are awsome. Real life situations happen. Canopy gets stuck, flaps jam, rotors bent, gear ripped off.When your guy ejects from a broken plane on the ground, that can't take off, he gets up and starts looking like he's cussing and making bad signals to the sky!!!. Whatever you do, Buy This Game."
5,A Reader's Delight,"Every once in a while browsings pay off handsomely. Why this book did not receive proper attention by the book world is a mystery. Philosophy once was considered a literary event. Today, philosophy is viewed as tedious and obtruse. In this work the author recognizes Hume's weighty considerations to make original philosophy accessible through powerful reasoning put forth in an engaging literary style. For those who enjoy the workings of fine minds and elegant writing, this book is not be to be missed."
5,Excellent!,"These are really nice. I got these for a Cinco De Mayo party. Everyone enjoyed the mararitas. If you like to entertain, you need to get these. The 9oz size means that people don't drink too much. The storage box is perfect."
4,Clean and Purposeful,This is a solid set to go with the rest of the items on the liquor cabinet. Arrived on time and intact.
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Caught in a rush for a surprise birthday party that serving plastic cups would have been ridiculed, I got what I paid for. Certainly will never grace Martha Stewart or Neil Berkus' table(s), but, it prevents itself from a complete tacky affair. I was already chastised by my ""living far beyond my means"" friend, MCW........so hopefully, if you decide to purchase these, you are of sound mind and body."
5,Update-new Revival at Snapple Theatre in NYC,"I had this original cast album on an LP in the 1960's while in college and now ordered the CD after seeing a great revival production in New York last week. It's at the Snapple Theatre, just a few steps off Broadway, in a small venue on the third floor. The best part is that Tom Jones, who wrote the original book and lyrics, plays the Old Actor! He is wonderful! Look for him in the playbill under the name ""Thomas Bruce."" If you are in New York and love this show, don't miss it."
5,Seeing The Play Again,"If you have seen the play, you will relive it over and over every time you listen to this CD. If you saw it on Sullivan Street, in your local high school or anywhere else. The magic of the play is captured in this album. You will be impressed by Jerry Orbach when he was just starting"
4,Fantastics record,"I ordered the Fantastics record because I was interested in one song on it. Somehow, I had never heard of this very successful musical. And I enjoyed almost all of it. Good stuff!"
4,"Finally, my hammer is my own","Ever since I moved in with my S. O. , he's always been running off with my 20+ year old Stanley hammer. I got this one for him, and FINALLY, he's leaving mine alone. Good hammer, nice features, easy to swing. Now to work on his wrenchs and screwdrivers. Why do men think all tools become theirs upon cohabitation?"
5,Practical help and thoughtful commentary,"The lucid explanations of every aspect of a subject that confounds many make this book an indispensable tool for publishing professionals, writers and students. Loaded with practical help and thoughtful commentary"
1,They never sent it,This is about the seller. I did get a refund after a while...it was not the fault of Amazon...they are great!
2,Ummmm.... Very Avoidable.....,"This one is 1.5 stars....If you have another choice, use it. This book is not really that good. It can be read, but it's really not a lot of fun. I'm kicking myself for even buying it. Especially after I read the first one and didn't like it at all....Larry Niven is a very good author. Jerry Pournelle is also very good. I am not sure what happened in this book.Again, if you have other choices, they are probably better."
4,Good Story,"I found this book to be very entertaining. After reading the first book out of sequence, I decided to try to collect the entire series. I'm still working my way through the series."
5,Extraordinary Performance,"Goode is at his best in this extraordinary performance of this extraordinary sonata -- written shortly before Schubert's death. The andante -- with its rumbling, ominous, resonant and (above all) beautiful bass -- is heartbreaking. Goode plays with an understanding of the nuances of the sonata that seem to me to be more sensitive than any other performance I've heard."
2,THIS IS ALL MIDI,"I own the English version of the game and absolutely love the music. However, they redid the music for the English version. THIS VERSION IS ALL MIDI. You will be very disappointed like I am if you expect the orchestral versions from the game."
2,This is NOT the Symphonic Suite But Potentially Worthwhile,"Like other fans and reviewers of this item, many are looking for the full orchestral version of the soundtrack composed by Koichi Sugiyama and the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra and were quite disappointed when they realized this is all midis.This is INDEED the soundtrack, however, the item descriptions all across the board are misleading so to get this out of the way YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE SYMPHONIC SUITE. Amazon does sell it for a pretty penny but it is WORTH IT!!That aside, the soundtrack is slightly reminiscent of older Dragon Quest games from the NES installments. THAT was it's original purpose but due to poor marketing unsuspecting buyers got something else. Nonetheless, this item is still worthy of hardcore gamer collections if you really want to fork over the coin. Otherwise, look up ""Dragon Quest VIII Symphonic Suite"" on Amazon as they are awesome enough to sell it."
2,Not the James Franco Biopic,"I purchased this from another site thinking I was paying for a set that contained the 2001 James Dean biopic starring James Franco. Every site you find this set on says that that movie is on this disc set. Well, it's not. So, if you are thinking of buying this because you want the James Franco version, don't. You will be disappointed. Someone seriously screwed up on the description of this set. With that said, however, this is a great set for any Dean fan, with interviews of the people who knew him best and never-before-seen footage of him. I was really looking forward to watching the Franco movie, so I was disappointed with this set for that reason only. I would give it 5 stars if the description matched the set itself."
5,Very fun and seems extremely durable :),"I love this toy. I got it in order to help entertain my three year old niece when she and her parents come over for dinner. Turns out, it is great fun for her AND her dad as they play with this one together! It is just adorable. :) It also seems super durable and very safe."
5,PERFECT for 1+ year olds,This toy is perfect for my 1 year old great grandson....he loves it and plays with it daily....It is great for developing his grasping and pushing the beads is fun for him...There is one of these in the pediatricians office and he plays with that one all the time...That is where I got the idea to get him o ne for home too! We love love love it!!!
5,"Wonderful for motor skills, critical thinking","My children had this when they were young and enjoyed it very much. In Florida, we have no basements or REAL attics and WE don't even have a garage to save things like this, so...I had to buy another for the grandkids! Can hardly wait to see the twins with this Christmas morning! I know they'll love it and get plenty of use out of it.12/27/12: My grandchildren LOVED this Christmas Day! They are 22 month old twins, a boy and a girl, and they BOTH had a blast with it! So did their 7 YEAR old cousin! I think that's quite an age spread to enjoy the same toy! This will still be played with in 5 years or longer! This is an INVESTMENT toy! If you have room to store it when your kids outgrow it, you'll still have it for the NEXT generation! Every kid should have an Educo Supermaze!!!"
2,hits and a whole lot of misses,"Peter Gabriel tries to be arty but his poor composition skills and squeal vocals get the best of him. Thus, most of his material suffers from lack of good composers- he is really missing the talents of Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford. He also tries to be too funky and ""womad"" infusing as many different sounds as possible but not really amounting to anything of substance. Almost a one star rating but the wonderful Solisbury Hill and Games Without Frontiers save this dreadful compilation. It's is a shame that he did not continue along the lines of those two wonderful early tunes. Nice to have Sean Connery as a special guest- or is that Gabriel??? Go back to Genesis 007 !!"
4,Good Music,"I am a Peter Gabriel fan, good music, If they put all the songs that were great on 1 cd or even 2 thier will be little money to be made.I listen and enjoy this set."
3,"Great Music, So-So Collection","I'm a hige Peter Gabriel fan and I own virtually everything he has out so getting this album wasn't high on my list because there wasn't much that is new. Now that I have it and have listened to it I'm a little disappointed. Not by the music itself but by what is included. I think I can sum this up by comparing this collection to the Bruce Springsteen collection released about the same time. Bruce's collection was three discs, two of hits and one of rarities and live performances. With two discs there was plenty of space to cover all the hits and then some. That is what I found was missing on Peter's Hit were some singles like ""The Barry Williams Show"" while other songs from that album were included. All in all it is a great collection, just not as complete as I would prefer."
4,"What's here is good, but it shortchanges PG1 and PG2.","The album is for the most part a ""Shaking the Tree"" upgrade -- a bunch of songs from the 80s, only now with 90s/00s material added. But it falls short precisely where ""Shaking the Tree"" does: only 1 song (""Solsbury Hill"") from the 1st 2 albums.In addition, Gabriel includes 5 songs from his latest album, which begs the question: Why? ""Up"" was no doubt strong, but it does not merit 30 minutes of disc space at the expense of his early work.""Hit"" is not a representative sampler of Gabriel's output."
4,"great 3cd set, oh wait no...its not","Definitley need a re-issue, with all the songs on it now, & the ones added on the german release, as well as 'Out, Out' from Gremlins & When Your Falling from the Afro Celt collaberation. Theres too many (essential) things missing for this to be a 'definitive collection'. B-sides (soft dog...) would be nice, more live versions-this is box set territory, but that at least, is definitive. Casual listners start here, die-hards buy it. Those in between-write angry letters"
4,Worth buying,I bought this CD just for Solsbury Hill. The song is in Vanilla Sky which is one of the all time greatest movies. Every time I hear Solsbury Hill I think of that crazy movie. I've played the song and the movie lots of times and never get tired of either one. Peter Gabriel is one in a million.
