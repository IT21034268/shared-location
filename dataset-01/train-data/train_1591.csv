3,HUSBAND LIKES THE FIT,"Husband likes the fit, however he really wants the LIBERTY brand because they have the zipper in the front chest pocket for those things that might fall out when bending over like a wallet, keys, gun etc...So got these as a backup!Nice quality and fit just dont have the desired green zippered chest area... seems like all the farmers in our part of the country all wear the LIBERTY BRAND TOO...must be something about that zipper!"
5,"So Soft, Roomy, and Long","These Dickies ""Men's"" Denim Stone Washed Bib Overalls are so soft, roomy and long. I normally wear a 16W womens, 34"" waist, 44"" hips. The 42/30 size I bought are quite roomy in the waist (as expected) and in the hips. Good for my purpose of gardening as they aren't binding up anywhere. The 2 pair I bought were much longer in the inseam than stated...about 3"" longer. No problem, as I can hem them. The back is high so the straps do not slide off your shoulders. They are a midweight jean, great for southern winter and early spring temperatures of 40's - 70's. I rate them an excellent value."
3,Seconds,"Please note that the product description above mentions that these are seconds. On mine the material is cut so close that the denim part of the pocket slips out showing its rough edges and the white material underneath, looking like my underwear is showing. And the hardware clips, after a few months of use, have fallen apart, which makes my pants fall down. On the other hand I put them on even to write this complaint. They are that comfortable."
3,just the wrong color but it is important to me and my work appearance,"when I saw the pic of the overalls it was the one of faded light jean as the pic provided at the right of this page, and there wasnt any other pic. When I got the overalls they were a indego blue(dark blueish) not like the pic that was shown (washed light blue). So i went back to the link and there was not only the faded blue but it linked to a pic of indego blueish averall. Even though the color wasnt what I wanted they are a good pair of overalls they just dont fit the era I portray. thank you for the business."
4,Durable/good fit,Bought these bib overalls to do some machine work a few times/week.They are durable and comfortable and fit my needs perfectly.Size is true.
3,good product,"The overalls are very well made but seem to run a size small, also I have a long torso so they tend to fit a bit tight in the crotch area and no matter how long I make the shoulder straps they are still confining. Go one size bigger"
4,Finally found farmer jeans,"Hi,I finally ordered farmer jeans after looking through various options, brands and prices.I don't usually order clothes on line but in town, my size is not available.These are at decent price, good quality, and I got them in reasonable time. They are comfortable to wear even if brand new, not like other brands. Amazon kept me informed all along the shipping process. I can say that I have no hesitations ordering things on AMAZON."
5,Good Stuff.,"This is the first Dickies product I could remember buying and after searching on Amazon they seemed like the best looking out of all the brands. I mean, after all, why buy designer overalls? So when I got home from work and tried them on I was very pleased that the fit was perfect and the material, clasps, buttons and so on are all really good quality. I can see these lasting me a good many years and as soon as they are done tumble drying I'm going to wear them out to our favorite cajun restaurant tonight for some crawfish and gumbo. They will look great with a long sleeved jersey, then a long sleeved 3-button thermal Henley over that and of course my white Converse Chuck Taylor Hi-Tops! I love my new Dickies Overalls from Amazon and you will too!"
2,Way too heavy!!,"I had hoped to find some overalls I could garden in, but these things are so heavy that they are uncomfortable and way too hot. I guess they would be great for a late fall clean-up in the yard, but forget them for summer."
1,Ugly detailing in RED!!!,detailing very poor and ugly! Color not realy washed... Not usable as an vintage iten it is just an OLD FASHION!
1,Made in China,"Don't be fooled by the description, this flag is NOT made in the USA. I purchased the flag under the impression that it was; when it arrived, the flag had a sticker on it that read ""Made in China"". A US Flag made in China... how ironic.As expected for the price, the quality of this flag is low but it still looks good hanging on a wall. I wouldn't fly it on a flagpole since the print is one-sided. You get what you pay for."
5,Love it...we need to make sure our elected understand what's essential,It was shipped immediately and was exactly what I expected. Thank you so much. Will do business in the future and look forward to it!
4,not too shabby,"interesting for an academic book, easy to read, and straight-forward. also, liked how they kept opinions open instead of trying to only make one point about certain cultures/ideas"
1,Dried my skin out and didn't even work,"I wish it were possible to give this 0 stars.It dried my skin out terribly, and I didn't see ANY difference.Don't waste your money on this."
4,Singing the body plutoniumized,"Andy's a bull in the china shop of American poetry, exactly where a bull ought to be. Whether he's singing the body plutoniumized, lamenting the destruction of American beauty, or simply trying to coax some woman into bed, he's a singer you can trust (even if the woman may have some doubts. & he's been treated shamefully by the literary powers-that-be.Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM>"
3,A nice ballad and a terrible hip-hop wannabe song. How do they fair you ask?,"Not that great.Big Girls Don't Cry --> 4.25Pedestal --> Terrible lyrics, ""clumsy"" beat and just an overall M-E-S-S. 2.5/5= 6.75/2= 3.3753.38 stars.Overall: C-"
1,Mis-represented,"The CD itself is fine, but the product was totally mis-represented. I was purchasing it because the format said karaoke, but it is NOT. Why would I pay $12 for a single cd when I could have purchased the entire cd for a couple of dollars more. Extremely disappointed."
4,new yardbirds,"I was impressed with the first L.P.-(yes I first bought these on vinyl) in the 80's with all the guest stars namely Jeff Beck. Great songs-very Yardbirdish and great lead singer John Fiddler-2nd l.p. not as good. Paul Samwell-Smith, Chris Dreja, Jim McCarty and Beck and Page are all here for your listening pleasure. For those interested get-""Birdland""."
3,real valiant attempt at first try for new band,"although box of frogs was an obscure band at most, they gave it a good shot at going mainstream rock and blues.Lead singer Kenneth Kerr proved to his diehard fans that he wasnt a rock and roll has been.And to come out and announce his alternate lifestyle with new bassist Don eccles was heartwarming.bravo for a good try Box of frogs!"
5,Somebody with power find the person who owns the Ed Series.,I will buy all four seasons immediately. I have a few episodes on an old videotape and I watch them over and over again.
5,The Time is Now!,"Ed is a wonderful show and it's time to release it. If someone could compile a list of the songs that have licensing problems, then we could (as a massive group) buy the songs in bulk off of iTunes or Amazon, or email the Record Labels and put our money and voices in their face. It worked for Chuck with thousands of fans eating at Subway and it saved the show. Just an idea."
5,When is this going to happen?!?!,Ed was one of the better shows on TV. Lately there is a lot trash on TV and Ed was good clean TV. Does anybody know when this is going to be available?!?!? It has been some time now....we want Ed!
5,Every Christmas...,"EVERY YEAR I come back to this site to see if maybe, MAYBE this is the year I can add Ed on DVD to my Christmas wish list. And yet, it still hasn't happened. Never mind the fact that I can get all varieties of crappy TV shows on DVD (Why would anyone buy Flavor of Love?) but the one show worth buying and watching cannot be had. WHEN WILL THIS HAPPEN?!? Along with human trafficking, not being able to get Ed on DVD soldiers on as one of the great unjustices in this world."
5,We Want Ed,"We want Ed on DVD, all seasons, right now. We've waited for years and even after all this time, the demand is there, so give it up, NBC execs!"
5,Best day of my life!!!,"I have been looking monthly for Ed to come out on DVD, and nothing. And I just looked today and there I found this!!!! I can't wait!! Please Please Please release this soon!!!!!"
5,I WANT ED ON DVD NOW!,"ed was my favorite (and still is my favorite) show on tv. It was classy, humouros and just good. Please someone let me know if they can find it on DVD somewhere."
5,NBC,"I've written several letters to NBC trying to find out what's going on. I haven't heard anything. The only rumor I've heard is that there was some kind of stipulation in the show's contract that said the DVD couldn't be released until 4 years after the last airing. And that rumor did NOT come from a credible source! Anyhow, I say let's all keep pestering NBC until, at very least, they give us some information on why it hasn't been released! If anyone hears anything, let us know!"
1,I found the three seasons of Ed out of Canada,"I am very disappointed in the quality of the DVD's. They were poorly made. ""Ed"" was one of my favorite sitcoms. They could at least show the reruns on TV. Janet"
5,gimme gimme gimme,I love this show. It makes me happy. Please release it soon. I'll be waiting. and waiting. and waiting. release. please. bowling alley lawyers need to be seen on dvd!!!
5,Joining the masses here at Amazon...,"WHAT is taking so long?!I remember signing up for the list to be notified when this becomes available a few months ago, and still NOTHING!I don't write reviews here, but for this I made an exception. Please release this on DVD. For how long it's been, might as well release all 4 friggen seasons, packed with awesome extras and commentaries on every episode, in a collectible package at a bargain price. Seems to happen that way with every other show on DVD, us poor saps buy them one by one and then the entire series gets nicely packaged into one easier-to-afford box set. So heres the chance to just hit us Ed fans with everything at once and we'll buy it.Or release them one by one. I DONT EVEN CARE AT THIS POINT, JUST GIMME THE DVDS!I want to show my girlfriend the episode where Mike shows his wife his calenders full of sex tallies and odd stats lol"
5,Sadly still waiting...,"This is my favorite show of all time. Unfortunately it was not ""tailored"" for the masses and did not catch on. I long for the day it is released on DVD."
5,Simply The Best,"My wife and I found ""Ed"" one evening by accident, when nothing else on the tube appealed. We thought it was charming, well-scripted, unusual compared to the rest of the garbage on TV at the time (except for JAG).We watched again the next week.The rest of the week following the second week, we fretted and squirmed in frustration, waiting for the next episode of ED. We was HOOKED.PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! Bring back this masterpiece of televison artistry in a single set containing ALL 4 SEASONS!The sense of loss we felt on hearing that ""Ed"" had been cancelled was absolutely deflating for us both. We were bummed out for days.What a boon it would be for us to be able to begin at Episode One, and re-live our enjoyment of this exceptional series all over again - any time we desired!BRING BACK ED!!!"
5,Fantastic Show,"Maybe it's because I wish I was Ed or because I have a huge crush on Carol Vessey, but this show needs to come out on DVD like yesterday. What's the deal? The demand is here now we just need the supply."
3,An alluring appetiser into Chopper's world,"This man has a style of writing which can be compared to no other. He is witty, funny, illiterate, genuine and above all: psychotic.The book starts off great but halfway lost its grip over me as it became a decoupled series of short stories where he tells of friends he has had in prison. Despite this, some of the stories are hilarious!Having read the book, I eagerly ventured onto the Web in search of more stories and tales of the feared Chopper Read. This was far more rewarding than the book itself, but obviously something I would not have done had I not learned of his background via the book.Chopper definately made an impression on me, that is, I even christened a boisterous new kitten after him: Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read."
5,True Crime With a Sense of Humility,A quick and easy read(no pun intended)that at times gets depressingly horrific.well worth the time and money for this one.
1,Get Smart: The Original TV Series - Season 1,OMG! I don't remember this show being boring like it is now. Now I have to resell this thing because it was a waste. I rate the seller a 5 star but the show was dumb.
5,Would you believe... a great old show,"A friend of our son's got him hooked on this old television show. I had really strict TV limits as a kid, so I'd never watched it. What a hoot! Once you get past all the shooting (bloodless) and the pretty lame female roles, you can just enjoy the clever writing and the sly humor.I thought that I was going to buy the collectionGet Smart - The Complete Series Gift Set, but many reviewers complained about poor (though clever) packaging and scratched DVDs. I couldn't determine whether that was an old packaging problem or ongoing, so instead I bought the five seasons separately for about the same price. Can't wait for our son to open his Christmas present so that we parents can enjoy it!"
5,"Wonderful. Get Smart Season 1, 2 & 3 on DVD","I purchasd Get Smart DVD, Season 1, 2 & 3 seperately. They were fairly inexpensive and the video quality was good. They were as funny as I remembered them in the 60's. Each episode starts off with a little summary by ""99"" Barabara Feldon, it was a nice touch."
5,A must have!,"If you are at all a fan of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry this is a must have! The quality is excellent, and of course the episodes hilarious. I would definitely recommend the first series. I will likely buy the others over time as well."
5,Get Smart,This is an excellent TV show that is funny and overwhelmingly entertaining. It can basically be described as a spoof on James Bond. The episodes are well written and run between twenty-one and twenty-three minutes.
4,Good old comedy,"This is a great series. It has great, classic Mel Brooks humor. Though some of the jokes may seem a little antiquated now, most of it is still brilliant. Do keep in mind that this is not the 2008 Movie. The movie is based on this 1960's TV series. I definitely recommend it."
4,"Get Smart, Season One, Well Done","Purchased this for my son's birthday. He loves it and I am reliving my youth. With all the trash on TV today, it's a relief to have wholesome entertainment to watch."
5,Got Smarter !,"It was a great trip down memory lane seeing these old shows again. Don Adams' comedic timing is impeccable, no one has that kind of timing these days. Barbara Feldon looks and sounds yummy throughout, what a dish ! Ed Platt is hilarious as the deadpan put-upon chief. Feldon also introduces each episode and her voice is as girlish as ever which is a real treat. The 60s really were an excellent ride for us all as far as TV and music were concerned. This a great set, worth every penny !"
4,Get Smart - Season 1 (THe Original TV Series),"Well worth the purchase price. Didn't realize the it is in color as when I first watched it we only had a black n white television. In vivid color, not like some old series you see on tv where the color is washed out."
2,Not what I expected ...,"I bought this little gem (stainless steel to last longer) in March, 2010, to clean my new car. I checked ratings and found it rated higher than most, so I bought it - wanted something better than the rechargeable ones. I have only used it twice because of health issues but I am really, really disappointed. Suction isn't what I was expecting - really have to work hard at getting it to pick up most bits on my car's interior. Also, the attachments keep falling off. I think I'll just (pardon the pun) suck up the loss and buy something else ... this one's too much of a challenge to use and much too frustrating!"
1,"Metro vac went kaput, in less than 15 minutes","I gave this to my aunt for christmas. It stopping working within the first 10 minutes of use. I'm infuriated. It simply failed, the vehicles electrical fuses were all intact. I bought the Metro vacuum because it touted ""Made in USA"". That labeling made me feel good.I have another (POS) 12 volt vacuum of my own, which cost only $19. It was Made in China. It works fine and is over 6 months old.This sort of thing gives me gray hair."
3,The lead vocals are amongst the world's best !,"This Dutch prog. rock band never achieved the status they deserved. The vocalist is one of the best I have ever heard. He has the power to move you emotionally. Some of the tracks should not have been included, but most of the songs are really good. Anne is my favourite track on this album and is a good example of ""medieval"" rock. If you like this one, get ""Merlin"" - it is fantastic."
5,Vintage Virtuous Queen,"A tremendous album with incredible variety of music. Innuendo opening track is simply epic, reminds me of Bohemian Rhopsody. This is one of those albums that just flows so well, the tracks are arranged in great order and ofcourse the ending track, The show must go on is a farewell statement by Freddie. Amazing how well and proffessianly Freddie worked despite having AIDS at the time. But ofcourse, we all now Freddie Mercury was one of the classiest people to live in the first place."
5,Innuendo1991,"A great ending for queen. Innuendo finds queen in fine form using their strong diverse songwriting abilities at their best. Innuendo, the show must go on, and slightly mad find queen at their epic best, while songs like these are the days and don't try so hard are great ballads. To the last reviewer: obviously you a minority in saying this album isn't good, If I was you I would stick to whitestink. Whitestank isn't a fraction of what queen was, but eventually you'll learn."
2,Overrated,"I love Queen. I purchased Innuendo because of the great reviews. I think ""I Can't Live With You"" and ""The Show Must Go On"" are awesome. I did not enjoy any of the other songs. Compared to the classic ""A Night At the Opera"" this album is very disappointing."
2,Be Aware,"This record has 2 very good songs- Innuendo and The Show Must Go On. In these 2 songs Freddie's voice sounds great. But the rest of the album is weak because Freddie's voice sounds unpowerful and even defected. He sounds like any other ordinary 70's hard rock singer. It's too bad because the tunes are great and shift from 80's pop back to hard rock. Very sad. This record could have been much better if Freddie hadn't been so ill.Freddie had left behind in this album 2 of his best songs, but the rest of the album is very weak."
4,Now the fun begins.,"This was the last album released by Queen during Freddie Mercury's lifetime. The album was a big success in most parts of the world, but not so much in the U.S., where Queen wasn't as popular as they once had been. No songs from this album charted in the U.S., but four of the songs were U.K. hits: ""Innuendo"" was a #1 hit, ""Headlong"" peaked at #14, ""I'm Going Slightly Mad"" reached #22 and ""The Show Must Go On"" topped out at #16. Overall, it's a very good album, although American fans may not enjoy it that much because there are no recognizable U.S. hits."
4,The Show Must Go On,"This was Queen's final studio album before the tragic passing, only a few months later, of Freddie Mercury, and is a testament to the courage of Freddie, who was already critically ill, when this album was recorded.Includes the really fun and topsy turvy I'm Going Slightly Mad, the contemplative Don't Try So Hard, the spiritual melody, All God's People, the smooth and reflective These Are The Days Of Our Lives, Freddie's fun ode to his pet cat- Delilah, and Queen's last farewell to their fans, as they knew that this would be their last album with Freddie- The Show Must Go On.Freddie Mercury's testament to the world will live on forever."
4,Fantastic Artistry,"Such a pity that this album was produced towards the end of Freddie's life, if it wasn't so, we could have had something even better. But as Queen albums go, this is still amazing, probably their best, with such strong and powerful music. It starts off what seems like another Bohemian Rhapsody, Innuendo, maybe it was Queen's way of making sure they went out with a bang. Then there is another classic rock track, Headlong. But the tip of the iceberg for me, has to be The Show Must Go On. It is sang with such feeling 'inside my heart is breaking, my make up may be flaking but my smile, still stays on'. A fantastic album."
4,REVIEW FROM A QUEEN FAN,"Listening to 'These are the Days of Our Lives' still brings tear to my eyes. Freddie, knowing what is about to happend, sings his loungs out. This was his last working album with his friends and co-workers. But he insists 'The Show Must Go On'. But what is Queen without Freddie Mercury? This album, released in 1991, has many good songs but also some average ones. But the good songs are somehow so strong that it's hard to give this cd 'only' 4 stars! Standout tracks: The Show Must Go On, Innuendo, These are the Days of Our Lives. GO FOR IT! IT`S WORTH IT."
4,"A most unusual, yet entertaining film","I recently screened this film and it's very unusual. However, it's also a well-made production and very entertaining. And unlike many odd films, it isn't incoherent junk: it's a fun and engaging story (despite it's wackiness). However, it's not for all tastes. Too bad that it's generally unavailable (from what I can tell there are some rights issues preventing a DVD release)."
4,Not for every taste (so you know it's special.),"I saw this movie 20-some years ago, when it was released to a few select markets. How PHOENIX was chosen, I'll never know! There were more than a few walk-outs. My friend and I found it magical and captivating. A few years ago I bought a DVD from Five Minutes to Live, that was apparently transferred from a TV broadcast. The picture quality is pretty poor -- but those of you who've seen the movie know that doesn't necessarily compromise the experience. The movie has its flaws. Granted, the production design aims for an unpolished look, but sometimes the production quality is poor in ways that were surely unintended. And the final sequence of the movie is weak, with a rushed and clumsy wrapping-up of the story. The magic comes from the mixture of whimsy, satire, stylistic anachronisms, and delightful performances by an off-beat cast. A terrific score by the now famous Howard Shore."
2,Disappointed...,"I don't know if I got a bad batch of these or what, but I bought a pack of these and all of the pens run out of ink while writing, so I have to shake it for the ink to come out. They're brand new pens... the ink stops flowing or something. I really wanted to like these."
5,uni-ball 207 Retractable Medium Gel Pens 8 colored Pens,"I love these pens. I use every color at work. Such a smooth write, even the orange one. Which I like to use on reports."
3,"Love these pens, but want refills!!!",I love the Signo 207 pens--they're the best gel pens I've ever used. What I don't love is not being able to get refills for any of them except blue and black! :(
3,Just average...,"I picked up a single purple 207 pen at Best Buy and used the crap out of it, so I naturally assumed that this pack would be out of this world. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed. All of the colors I was interested in--namely the light blue, pink, and green--are much less vivid. They write smoothly enough, but the line is pale compared to the other colors; I actually find the green and pink quite hard to read. Though the pen feels nice in the hand and writes smoothly, not all of the inks are the same quality.I'll use these for grading, but I'm definitely going to stick to my Pentel EnerGels for regular writing purposes."
2,"short life, then stops w 30% or more ink still in pen","Disappointing results w surprising short life and defective engineering, an entire order of these pens consistently stopped working with up to half of ink remaining inside - attractive, but refills near impossible to find and dubious value overall."
3,Pretty for a bit,"The pens write beautifully for a while. But after about a month of use they slowly start to die. It starts with the pen skipping a letter or two, then the ink will just stop running. It was infurating.It killed me because it would show there is still quite a lot of ink left in the pen, it just wouldn't work.Now i wouldn't worry if it was just one pen that did this, but every single color followed that pattern. They would work for a month, then die. I was sadly dissapointed, and next time i buy Pilot G-2. Same colors but they last a lot longer."
5,Good pens,Love being able to use multiple colors on cirtain projects. Great color and very smooth. they seem to last a long time
4,Price hike.,"FYI In April of this year I bought this for $7.88 for my husband to use at work. Now it is showing a price of over $11. I came back to buy two more sets, one for me and my husband at home. Love the pens but not at this price!Today they were $14.29 at Office Max and $13.99 at Staples online - both with added shipping without a minimum purchase. However, when checking Walmart they are $9.88.I'd like to see Amazon at least match Walmart's price."
1,Skip this one,"The Insiders guide is a very incomplete and inaccurate view of America's college campuses. Many schools are missing and many basic facts are wrong. The authors probably talked to one or two students per campus or maybe none at all. As a director of a private high school, I would not recommend any of our students read this dribble."
1,Cowardly Lion Costume Review,"VERY, VERY, VERY cheaply made. Sizing is WAY off(too small) Looks better in picture than it does on. Very POOR quality, for the outrageous price. The tail ripped and it is sewn right on your lower rearend instead of up higher. VERY DISAPPOINTED"
5,Magical!,"This was so entertaining. My daughter and I were just immersed in it. It's a Van Gogh painting come alive, at the same time it's a heartwarming story, partially based on ""The Last Leaf"". Like nothing I've ever seen before. Lovely."
5,pretty good O.S.T.,"A very good album with a fistful very good songs. If you like music with a hammering beat, enjoy ""Don't lose your head"" which has a nice meaning for the film Highlander, to which the album is soundtrack. The loud guitars go to Gimme the prize and One Vision. The hymn is ""Princes of the Universe"" for the heavy fraction and ""Who wants to live forever"" for those who love ballads. However, I don't really like ""Friends will be Friends"", but I have no idea why. ""Magic"" is just like the 80s and completes the Album as a great one. And when you listen to ""Who wants to live forever"", tears might come into your eyes."
3,About halfway there,"This is an odd album in the Queen catalog, essentially half a soundtrack with some other stuff thrown in. And it feels about halfway successful to me. ""One Vision"" is a great rocker and album opener. The title track is rather charming, and ""Who Wants To Live Forever"" is a goosebump-inspiring ballad. Unfortunately there is also some obvious filler here. Roger Taylor's ""Don't Lose Your Head"" is utterly pointless. I feel sorry that Freddie had to lend his voice to such rubbish. ""Princes of the Universe"" is an okay rocker, but with incredibly inane lyrics. Recommended for Queen fanatics and completists."
4,Good album by Queen,"I wouldn't rate this one as one of the best Queen albums, but it's still pretty good. Best songs on this album are One Vision, A Kind of Magic, and Princes of the Universe. Who Wants to Live Forever is an okay track, but the rest of the album is filler."
3,THE LOWLIEST OF ALL QUEEN ALBUMS.,"I have been a devout Queen fan since 1980, and I greatly enjoy their music, along with many of their solo efforts. With the exception of ""One Vision"", which I consider to be their best song of the '80s not found on The Game, this album is discontinuous and lacks real charm. Overall it left me cold. The ""rocker"" cuts weren't all that gripping, and the soft songs were somewhat trite. The Miracle was a step back in the right direction, and Innuendo was, in richness and song writing quality, a true to their haydays from '73 through '80--Mercury's swan song."
3,A mixed bag!,"some good tunes here like one vision, the title track, who wants to live forever and princess of the universe. magic also has some very poor songs like ""pain and pleasure"" and ""don't lose your head"" should have been a much better album."
4,Interesting,"This album is partially a soundtrack in that 7 of its songs (Forever, Who Wants to Live Forever, One Year Of Love, Gimme The Prize, Princes Of The Universe, part of Dont Lose your head and the title track) were included in the film Highlander albeit in mostly different versions. One Year Of Love itself is very underrated, its one of only 5 Queen songs that dont feature Brian Mays guitar playing at all and it has a light pop sound but it works. This album also is the most Prog Rock oriented of Queens 80s studio albums and after The Works ignored the genre save Mashines and Hot Space did not feature it at all its nice to hear it back in Queens sound (even if naturally not fully). This is a good album and one of the highlights of Queens 18 album career."
4,"Great, great fun!","Yep, this one's a dousy! One of their best hard rock albums out there. There's a little story I'd like to tell...I found out from a friend that Queen sang the theme song for the TV show Highlander. I loved that song, so I went on a mission to find out where I could purchase it. I ended up buying a soundtrack that had all the musicial orchestrations from all three Highlander movies, which was a big mistake because it didn't have Princes of the Universe on it. The soundtrack is great though. Anyways, so a little later when I had some more money in my hands, I found this album, A Kind Of Magic and voila! Pure Highlander! Pure Queen! and Pure Satisfaction! Classic songs include: Princes of the Universe, A Kind of Magic, and One Vision. The art inside the cover and out is mind-boggling, and of course I always can't wait to open up the booklet and take a peek inside to see all the pretty pictures and lyrics! The jewel of the Crown! You know you want it..."
1,A kind of bad album.,"The worst album by Queen. I can't believe all the praise it gets!! It's like some kind of conspiracy...The album is pop metal, the tunes are weak, more that weak: they are annoying. The production is floppy... I have not enough words to describe thepiece of bad rock this albums represent. It's almost inredible this was the sam band that recorded THE GAME, A NIGHT AT THE OPERA and other masterpieces."
5,The greatest album around!!!!!,"This has to be the best, no the greatest album on earth. It is spiritual, emotional, heart pounding and inspiring aolbum I have ever heard. It is unfortunate that Freddie Mercury is no longer with us, but we can still listen to his beautiful, expressive and talented voice and also the voices of the Roger, Brian and John. I love it, too bad they do not let you give an album higher than a 5 star, because my rating would be much higher."
5,SO COOL!!,"this makes the 5th copy of this cd that I have bought through the years..still love it after all this time..Totally recommend it for any ""Highlander"" movie fan.Great quality and fast shipping..thanks so much"
5,Princes of the Universe,"Queen's album A Kind of Magic serves as the score for the sci-fi classic film Highlander and includes such familiar tracks as ""Princes of the Universe"" (later the theme for the television series) and ""Who Wants to Live Forever?"" In short, if you enjoyed the music of the film, you'll want this album.Yet even if you aren't familiar with the movie, the album is a great example of Queen's music from the 80's. Better than their Flash Gordon soundtrack and truer to other Queen music from the same era, the album offers both hard rock anthems and more haunting paeans. Give the tracks a listen if you're unsure about buying, but after a sample you'll likely want to take this album home."
5,their can be only one,"it's magic, a solid effort from the boys. an underated gem from the 80's. ""princess of the universe"" is a favorite, the ""title track"" is also a fun listen."
1,history of pioneers in Ulen and vicinity,My grandfather wrote this book and I am looking to buy a copy for my family. Any help would be appreciated.
2,Too early Capra,"This is not a good movie, despite the directorship of Capra and the presence of some solid actors. Warner Baxter is miscast. The story is very weak and predictable. And the technical aspects of the film are poor. (Harry Cohn loved stock shots; they were cheap.) Save your money."
4,Good...could have been better,"I own many concert DVDs. This is a solid performance, but not outstanding. Carmichael and Gilderdale give excellent performances on guitar. The three-man back-up band provides solid support, but nothing outstanding. There is a great variety of songs covering the span of Alchemy's work. As an Acoustic Alchemy fan, this is well worth owning. However, the concert was recorded at a holiday resort, so the staging and lighting are not great. The stage is very small and looks like they are performing at Uncle Nutsy's Clubhouse on Weird Al's UHF. Lighting is completely bland, and the video work is only average."
1,Acoustic Alchemy - Sound of St. Lucia,"This is the type of music good to your ""Alma"" (Soul), so sat down with your companion having a great wine an relax. The sound are excellent and it a great band. I brought this DVD because it was the only one a could find of them, but if you want to listen another album of them try the album called ""Reference Point"" ."
2,Much ado about nothing for me.,"Can't tell it helped at all. Not worth the money, but at least I tried. I remember I bought it to help with anxiety related to menopause, but it was useless for that. At least for me. someone else may have better luck."
1,Kessinger Publishing,"Buyer beware: Kessinger ""Publishing"" does not actually sell you a new printing of Treitschke's book. What you end up with is actually just a photocopy of an old edition (in this case, the 1914 Stokes printing). Unbelievably, it also includes page underlining and marginal notes, photocopied from a used and marked up version of the text. Apparently it was too difficult to find an unmarked text, or to white-out the markings when photocopying the text. If you want an unmarked version of this text, avoid the Kessinger version--you might as well buy a used copy of an actual printing rather than a photocopy of someone else's marked-up text. It is disingenuous, misleading, and possibly fraudulent for Kessinger to sell this as ""new."""
4,Love it,"I love the fact that this product makes my skin feel so soft. However, if you are a person with oily skin like me I would tell you to make sure to use this product only at night as it will begin to feel greasy during the day."
1,not worth the money,this product really doesn't do anything for my skin at all - it does smell lemony - and it's not expensive but it doesn't brighten the skin -so save your money - as the saying goes you get what you pay for - I gave it 1 star because I had to give it something - would have prefered - no stars -
4,Good Value / Good DVD/CD,I took my daughters to see Taylor Swift over the summer and was amazed at the show. This video does a good job replicating the show which is what is intended to do. For 16.99 you cannot beat that price on any DVD/CD combo for any artist.Good for any Taylor Swift fan!
5,"If you love T-Swift, get this!","I love Taylor Swift and went to the Speak Now concert and I am delighted to relive it in the comfort of my own living room. If you love Taylor, get this!"
5,At-home Concert,"I love this CD!!! When I first heard the preview clips of this CD, I got chills! I felt like I was back at the Staples Center hearing her sing live! If you are or know any Taylor Swift fan who didn't get to go to the concerts, this is a must because like I said you feel like you're at the concert! It's amazing and what gets me every time, is that the recordings are so clears that you can even hear the crowd chanting the lyrics to the songs!! Totally recommend this to any Taylor Swift fan!!"
5,It is amazing,I got it at Best Buy and watched the whole thing. It was really amazing and felt like you were really in concert. great videos.
3,DVD-quality picture and Dolby 5.1 sound,"The only thing blu-ray about this concert is the box it comes in. If you're a Taylor Swift fan, buy the less expensive DVD version. If you're buying to show off your HD TV or your sound system, don't."
5,"Great for Taylor Fans, but FYI...","This album is great for collectors. It differs from the original live album with three extra songs on the DVD and a documentary for the making of the Mean music video (also featured in Behind the Video on CMT). Just be aware this is a Target exclusive CD, which I failed to figure out before I bought it from Amazon. It's only $20 at Target stores right now. When it's out of production at Target, then it may be worth this much, but right now, just scoot on over to Target and get it."
1,"Boring, Boring and Boring.","Taylor Swift is so boring her music is the worst I have seen in my life. Her songs are about love. I guess that's the only thing she can come up with when she writes her songs. Also, she's the MOST overrated country singer today. When there are way better singers than her, anyway. I wish I could rate this with 0 star."
2,This is fake - lip-syincing and fake guitar playing - average cd,"Taylor has sold millions to tween fans around the world but this live cd is really a sham since Taylor is known to both lip-sync and sing behind a track to cover her performance shortcomings. Why can't so many people see the truth, see the fake guitar playing, the Les Paul prop, the manufactured smile? Someday the industry will look back and laugh at what they gave Taylor, so many awards stolen from other artist? Oh well, I congratulate her marketing skills and merchandising skills - good luck. These songs are fine pop tunes, but nothing more. These words do not ""count"" since they are basically about boys, kissing, and high school bleachers...not too deep to be considered an artist."
2,Too much screaming on the live version.,I thought it would be a good value but it sounded like a bunch of girls screaming in the background. Poor audio recoeding.
2,"I LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT A LOT, BUT NOT THIS CD",I AM A BIG FAN OF TAYLOR SWIFT AND HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS. I HAVE 4 COPIES OF ONE OF TAYLOR'S CD's. THIS CD INCLUDES A LOT OF FANS SCREAMING. I RARELY LIKE LIVE CD's AND THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION. I WILL CONTINUE LISTENING TO TAYLOR'S OTHER CD's. I WILL NOT LISTEN TO THIS ONE.
1,world tour live,Item has not arrived therefore any review is not possible. Why it has not arrived is a mystery and the sooner it is solved the better!
4,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE Taylor, and this CD/DVD is so amazing! I didn't have the opportunity to watch her in concert, but this DVD is a great gap filler on what I missed out on. The only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five, is because in some of the songs on the CD, the fans scream WAY too much. But, hey, its Taylor, I'd be flipping out too! <3 <3 <3"
1,Pathetic,"This ""book"" is terrible. It's not funny, ""goths"" are lame, and he stole the name of the greatest satirist of the eighteenth century. Lame. I recommend this book to retards and ""goths"", although they really are the same thing.P.S. Goths are (well, were) actually an East Germanic tribe that conquered parts of the Roman Empire. God, do ""goths"" steal everything?"
5,Great satire of the goth culture!,"Regardless of whether you are a goth, wish you could be one or just love reading the comics that seem to be found in the hands of goth comic fans, you will enjoy this book. Created by goth musician Voltaire, he gives his own humorous spin on the whole goth satire thing. And he does it quite well.Focusing around the self absorbed alien Heironymous Posch, the comic quickly starts on it's intended purpose- to showcase the good, bad & ugly side of the goth culture. You see just about every single version of goth & in so doing you actually see the same stereotypes that exist in any subculture!Now don't start thinking that Voltaire isn't capable of poking fun at himself either- he's just as likely to take a potshot at his real life self as much as he will mock any of the random characters in this book. Some people may not like this series, but then those are the people who just don't understand that any way of life can be made fun of!"
1,no thanks,"I thought I could not go wrong with a comic by Voltaire, as I am a huge fan of his music. But this was a letdown.the Illustration is very poor and thus the story line is hard to follow. Voltaire's humor within this book seems overdone, furthermore I found the satire to be unoriginal, and off-putting. It's not that I can't take a joke, but these jokes are ineffective."
3,Lissette - Amarraditos,I would have like them to sing more romantic songs than the ones they picked up. When I heard that they had recorded an album together I was expecting love songs that carry the kind of special feelings that emanates from two people in love....However their voices are beautiful....
4,A lesson learned for those who sway from a positive spirit!,"If I had to summarize (in one word) SCARLET MOON, I would say,""realistic."" As we move through this journey called life, our experiences often times shape our character. This book is a great read especially for those who have been loved and not appreciated the blessing! I can't wait to purchase the next book."
2,not worth it,"i know these fixtures are very reasonable price wise, but they really are, in my opinion, pretty junky. One had parts missing. Seller did send them to me though. Overall quality is poor. mine were slightly deformed and paint was off of some areas. Does not install well at all. Globes do NOT tighten up which does not give you a good feeling. i would just spend a little more money and get a different brand"
5,An Incredible Bargain For Russ Ballard Fans- Two Albums On One CD,"THE FIRE STILL BURNS is a 16-track CD featuring two of Russ Ballard's albums- 1984's RUSS BALLARD and 1985's THE FIRE STILL BURNS- in their entirety on one CD. The former is a collection of straight-ahead pop-rock songs including the hits ""Voices"" and ""Two Silhouettes"", whereas the latter seems to be one of many albums whose theme is time and what its passage means. Some of the songs on the second half of this CD have inspired me to skip my high school graduating class reunion in favor of looking good for my favorite actresses, but the first half is just as great. This is a CD that any serious rock fan must own."
3,Where's my reader?,"I got the card but DID NOT get the card reader as advertised. The vendor claimed it was an Amazon promo and that they had nothing to do with the bonus reader, and Amazon failed to admit their fault. So they gave me a refund for the reader instead. Other than that problem, the card is excellent and works well with my Kodak z712IS. A must have.To all readers: double check the advertised product title so that you know exactly what you're going to get."
1,"not as advertised-not micro, won't fit my phone, no free ""bonus"" reader came with it. Bummer experience.","I expected a bonus micromate reader and a micro storage card as advertised, for my verizon cell phone to store music. Instead I got a large camera card, (too big for my cell phone) and no ""Bonus MicroMate Reader"" in the package when it came. Don't know who to send it back to and it really isn't worth the trouble of driving down to the post office and paying to send it back. I threw it in the drawer. Maybe someday I'll get a camera it will fit. Poor buying experience. I went to Staples here in Roanoke, Va and bought a nice 8 gig little micro-mini storage card that I wanted in the first place and it fits in my Verizon Cell Phone under the battery in the little slot there."
1,the worst seller,THE SELLER COMPANY IS THE WORST I WAS DEALING WITHCASHED THE CARD ON 12/18/2007 AND NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT!!!I NEED A REFUND ASAPREGATDSDANRAMNICEANUPS I WILL RATE 'ZERO'
3,High capacity but slow card,This high capacity card transfers its images to my computer a bit slowly using the supplied micromate reader which you will need unless you use the camera itself. I noticed that its transfer rate is about 2.5 MB/second which translates into a little less than 1/2 hour for all the images if you fill the card to capacity. I have other Sandisk SD cards that are much faster but I will use this card for travel when I am more concerned with capturing many pictures and am willing to wait to transfer them to my computer when I get home.I received excellent delivery times from Amazon and its supplier for this product and have never lost a picture due to a Sandisk card failure or had any compatibility issues with Sandisk memory cards. I rate the card 3 stars because of its speed; otherwise the card and its reader work well.
4,Ton of space and easy to connect to PC,"I used this 4GB memory card and took 850 photos, and 10 or so video clips on a 13 day tour of the UK with resolution at 2,272 x 1,704 with my Canon S3 IS. I only used up 1.5GB. No worries about a full card and the reader made it easier to plug directly into the computer's usb. As the fine print says though, the reader will only work with this 4GB memory card. I tried it on a 1GB SanDisk without success."
4,Memory Card Review,"This is a terrific item, so much so in fact that I also bought one for my daughter for use with her camera.Very glad I purchased this, received it in a very timely fashion and have been usikng it since the day it was received."
3,4-Gig Memory Card,"This card works in my computer without any problems, but I bought it to work in both my computer and my PDA. It absolutely will not work with my IPAC PDA. My PDA does not even recognize that it is in the PDA!!!"
3,No pictures,"Kindle version is free, but those historical pictures are missing. DRAT.Otherwise this book does a great job filling in some gaps for me. However, a picture is worth.....well, you know."
3,Review of Pohl,"I enjoyed the first book - the second book was overly detailed about few events. This book continued the plot yet didn't seem to finish the story. I thought this was a trilogy. I was interested to see what happens with the Horch and the Others, and of course, the reverse big bang theory. I would like to see another book come out. After reading Pohls minibiography on the web, I'd also like to explore some of his other works."
2,Blah.,"That's exactly what this books is like. Blah. The characters are very ... one dimensional. The book starts off quite well, and manages to keep the reader intersted for a while. But somehwere near the middle, things start moving so fast, its almost comical. By 'fast' I mean that it doesn't spark any questions/ discussion in the reader's mind. It just happens. The concept isn't all that bad, but everything else could've been dealt with a little more attention to detail."
2,Quirky but sometimes annoying,"I don't know if I can really comment on Pohl as an author, having only read this and Drunkard's Walk. Anyway, this book is entertaining about half the time and aggravating the other half. I actually like Dopey, one of the aliens. The human characters are ok.. but sometimes too one-dimensional. At times he could do a better job of describing them so we can visualize. The fairly frequent sexual references are indeed a snore. There are grammatical errors and sometimes the sentence structure is not pleasant to read. I don't think I will get the sequel."
1,When will the story start?,"The first 3rd of the story was a boring mystery style with a detective for a main character and almost no sci-fi at all.They get abducted by lame aliens (easy to fool, look like people in costumes, etc) for the middle 3rd.Eventually some new aliens that have some hope of being interesting attack for the final 3rd, but in the end nothing much happens.The book was called ""The other end of time"" but should have been ""a short discussion about the other end of time"".The worst part was a recommendation by Greg Bear on the cover. I love his work but apparently he will recommend anything."
3,"A good read, but....","A enjoyable book that was thought provoking while not dry and difficult to read. The characters were well thought out and fairly developed, will the plot was at times far reaching and very reasonable at the same time. I would catorize this book as hard science fiction, yet much of the ""science"" has been well used in writings; i.e. Tachyons are used quit frequintley in Star Trek. But...the ending left me hanging. The characters seem to wrap things up too quickly for my taste. I was glad to learn there is at least one sequel."
2,I thought Frederik Pohl would be better.,"After hearing that Frederik Pohl was supposed to be a great novelist, I picked up ""The Other End of Time."" In the first section, it seems more like a mystery than a sci-fi. Then the plot slows down considerably. It picks up a little at the end, which I read for lack of anything else to do, but it has no real closure. However, I wouldn't want to read a sequel. In some parts, the story is a litle suspenseful, and that does add to the factor of wanting to read a little more, but most areas lack any form of suspense at all. ""The Other End of Time"" really isn't worth the price tag."
2,A very uninspired book for Pohl.,"The few books I've read by Pohl have always been better then this. The plot moves along at a plodding pace, particularly in the middle. During this time, everything takes place in a small cell in which Pohl documents each and every time one of the character has to relieve themself. This is occasionally broken up by visits from their alien captor, but these visits do nothing to break up the monotony. The ending, once I forced myself to read that far, seemed rushed and there was no closure. It felt like Pohl just decided to cut the book off at that point. A few more chapters could have easily been added. Also, I didn't find my self liking any characters at all. Pohl does manage to paint an interesting picture of the future and bring up a few thought provoking topics, they're just buried under piles, and piles of garbage."
2,Surprisingly bad,"Suspiciously similar in some ways to Wall Around A Star, which I found so boring I couldn't finish, this simply wasn't very good at all. Long, boring, surprisingly crude writing. Pohl's capable of great work but this isn't it. I sincerely hope that this was just a bad book and not a harbinger of further decline."
5,Pohl at his best,"Part of a true three novel trilogy Eschaton, including (The Other End of Time, The Siege of Eternity, The Far Shore of Time). This trio deals with first contact but Pohl couldn't let it be a simple aliens encounter, there are two different and of course warring alien alliances but that is as far as the ""of course"" goes. The leaders of earth first have to come to terms among themselves so they can choose correctly from slim, hidden and misleading evidences, which group of aliens is truthful and altruistic and which will conquer and enslave.Besides the wonderful Sci-Fi and multitude of sentient beings there is a good study of the human psyche in captivity. Also a twist in dealing with unwanted clones; not knowing which is the original, if there is an original, which clone gets the spouse and like conundrums.You have to stay alert to the fast pace and changing / multiplying cast. A very good read with interesting alien customs and biology's."
3,i didn't hate it,"But i didn't love it either. It has its moments, it has some interesting ideas, but what hurts it is the big chunk in the middle where they're all in the prison. that lasts for about 150 page, and it's pretty slow and uneventful. after that it picks up again and it's quite fun to read. I thought the alien was a little too childish looking (the ways it's described anyway) but I'll still read the next one just to find out what happens."
2,"nice branches, weaker tree","The Other End of Time had a lot of interesting, if not terribly novel, concepts. The method of transportation via duplication is an interesting one, with clear ethical implications which we haven't as yet had to address. Additionally, the representation of the aliens was provoking -- the story never resolves who are the ""good guys"" and who are the ""bad guys"", but then real life is rarely black and white.But despite the positive aspects of the work, the end was a profound disappointment -- too much was unresolved. Normally this wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but in this case the reader is left feeling empty; little is learned. So while The Other End of Time has components of interest, overall it's lacking, and the characters, which are established in a promising fashion, descend towards the end into cliche. The interesting discrete elements fail to make a compelling package.Overall, it's hard to recommend this book."
3,A fine effort by Mr. Pohl,"I found this to be an interesting and entertaining book but it is certainly not a classic of science fiction. Pohl is very talented at writing dialogue, and I enjoyed the interplay between the characters. The story gets somewhat bogged down in the middle while our heroes are in the alien cell and then ends somewhat abruptly. The aliens' use of ""tachyon"" technology for transportation and copying is interesting. I was puzzled at the end as to who/where are the copies and who/where are the originals, maybe the sequel will make that clearer. By the end of the book it seems to be clear who the ""bad"" aliens are or does it? Are we being mislead on this? I've started reading the sequel so I'll comment on that also when I finish it. This book is better than the majority of science fiction that I read. Could someone explain the relevance of the title though? At age 80+, Pohl is still going strong!"
1,My rating is really -5 (negative 5),"Really, Amazon should have ratings from -5 to 5. This book is unreadable and insulting to your intelligence. Has nothing to do with SCIENCE fiction"
3,Informative...,"A most read, it is important to understand the underlinying of the thoughts of those that at one time or another promoted this failed socio-economic and political form of government."
4,Marx the weepy humanist,"This is kind of a mixed bag. It's seems more like a peek into Marx's private notebook than a fully formed treatiste per se, he's just starting here to pin down things like capital, labor, money, and the individual, and to give some basic analysis with regards to how they interact. But by the end, I was surprised at just how humanistic it turned out to be. This isn't the often cold, polemical materialism that he would develop later on, but something which is deep down concerned with the problems that capital et al. has for basic human dignity and value. Maybe I'm telgraphing too much of Heidegger into it, but it seems that what this gets at is the ways in which capitalism alienates us not just in our day to day lives, but on a more metaphysical level, from our sense of Being itself. It's a very sensitive, musing piece of writing which, for it being Marx, I found refreshing"
2,"""Eh""","Well, I suppose this product gets the job done, overall. The protector for the top screen is fine, but the sheet for the bottom screen is not the right size..it doesn't fully cover the entire bottom screen at allI was kind of disappointed, the ""squeegee"" is just a piece of thick cardboard (but hey, it works I guess), the cleaning pad is alright, though I don't really use it.Though it's a relatively inexpensive price, I would say look for something better."
3,No Go,"This screen has some serious problems. The major one that comes to mind is the air bubbles, which are extremely annoying, and don't seem to go away. Another problem is the dust accumulation underneath the screen. When I got it, I cleaned the DS screen before putting the safe screen on, and a couple days later, there was an assortment of dust! Don't get me wrong, I live in a very clean house. It is just a major annoyance to have stuff underneath the protector you can't wipe off."
1,Read the facts,"Read the facts. I am from Costa Rica. Nicaragua is my northern neighbor and saw the atrocities that communism did to did country while the Soviet Union was infiltrated in that country during the Cold War. The grocery stores did not have food in the stands, kids were dying of disease and the illiteracy climbed to the roof.The proof was the we had an avalanche of massive immigration to Costa Rica. The kids instead of growing up learning how to to use a pencil, they learned how to use a machete.If you really want to get the facts of this beautiful and diverse land I suggest you read the ""Guide to the Perfect Latin American Idiot"" by Alvaro Vargas Llosa.[...]"
1,Biased and inaccurate,"As a latin american, I'm sick how people in my region blame others for own problems. Problems that we have caused ourselves.For a better view of the problems of latin america and understanding of people like Galeano, I recommend reading the book ""Guide to the Perfect Latin American Idiot"" by Mendoza/Montaner."
1,White Liberal Guilt on Display,"Dear readers: You owe it to yourselves to read at least one of two excellent point-by-point critics of Galeano's 1971 work. They are ""The Guide to the Perfect Latin American Idiot"" and the more recent ""The Idiot's Return"" both by Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, Carlos Alberto Montaner, and Alvaro Vargas Llosa (real Latin American experts)."
1,"America haters of the world, UNITE","this book is nothing but communist tripe, from the ungrateful leftists who cannot accept that we saved them from Spanish imperialism, and communism, and that they cannot accept that even after being independent for hundreds of years, they wallow in their own corruption."
1,Neo-Marxist Analysis = Anti-Catholic & Western,Like so many of the neo-Marxist critiques that have flourished in academia this book comes from a view that the only level of historical analysis is dialectical materialism. Marxist analysis needs a victim/victimizer paradigm to make its case.This analysis is unbalanced and doesn't take into account the tens of thousands of natives who were part of the daily human sacrifices made by the Aztecs . . . yes the Aztecs!The irony of the title (Open Veins) is that the native Latin American blood letting that was the most historically henious was at the hands of Native Latin Americans.[...]
1,"30% of the time, its comprehensive all the time","This is an incomplete read of how government can skew advancement, noting involvement by foreign nations, while wholly silent on how much more drastically Latin American governments themselves have hurt their own populations. My familiarity with the hardships suffered by the Mexican population led to my reading this book several years ago. Chavez's recent endorsement of this book lends credence to my first impressions. [...] Unfortunately, this book endorses a view friendly to the dictatorial history and rulers of Latin America (the only reason why Chavez hasn't censored its publication) that will garner political sympathy of the status quo from uncritical readers."
2,Why are you talking?,"Probably most of you, or NONE OF YOU, have actually lived in Latin America. And when I mean live, I don't mean live as staying in a house with swimming pool and air conditioner, or in secure compounds. Many of you, won't get the main idea of the book, but working in the oil industry in Latin American has showed me, that the book makes SOME sense. We can compare this as if someone would write a book about the home foreclosures, unemployment, and recession, which the country is going through and giving to Chavez's instead...what the hell does he care about our situation?"
1,"Facts are facts, but we cant blame others for out mistakes.","As a REAL LATINAMERICAN that was born and has lived in Latinamerica most of his life i have to say i disagree with this book. Yes facts are facts and the USA has intervened in latin america far too many times, but we cant blame them for our problems. Look at Cuba, after the early 1960's the USA has not intervened with Cuba and Fidel has been free to run ""his"" country, and look at what he has done, even after he received billions in money from the former USSR. Yet, who do we blame for Cuba being such a poor country?I recommend reading ""Fabricantes de Miseria"" its a great and not one sided book about how everyone from wealthy bussiness families to unions and militaries have ruined latinamerica. Although i think that book is only in spanish."
1,Pure Garbage,"'We are poor, because they are rich'. This book is the bible of the perfect latin american idiot"
1,More left wing crap,"Try to make others believe we are are not responsible for our own mistakes. More left wing crap, period. Don't bother, just another cheap attempt to brainwash the minds of those who don't want to see the truth."
1,No thanks Hugo,"I might have bothered to read this book if it had not been a gift from Hugo Chavez to Obama. Now, I simply won't read it on principle. I'm tired of the blame game on America."
4,"Excellent Source book, but needs to be complimented","This book must and has to be read in conjunction with""Confessions of an Economic Hitman"", which talks about how US and western corporations purposely wreck, penalize, and destroy third world nation's economies and societies. Then you get the full view, one from the side of the nations that are effected, and one from a former agent who had a hand in the destruction. Oh yes, and it's still not complete without ""The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and it's Geostrategic Imperatives"", by Zbigniew Brzezinski, one of the main founders of neocon, and really, corporate domination through government thought.When you put everything together, yes, you will be either very very angry, or very very sad. I was both.Author ofJACKFRUIT: A Bicycle Quest Through Latin America"
1,What a distorted view of the real reasons,"I recommend people read ""Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano"" before reading Galeano's point of view. Blaming the Americans for the ineptitude and corruption of local governments in L.A. is ludicrous."
5,Latino History,This history is told from the point of view of the oppressed people detailing the horrible conditions in Chile during the Industrial Revolution.
1,"Biased, I love historical books but this one is not based on all fact. It certainly presents itself to be which is false","I'm not going to go into details here but the book is one sided, not fact driven but certainly ""implies"" it is. If you are going to write ""history"" books then you should probably include all sides and all factual content, not just your opinion."
1,mmm.. como tanta gente puede ser engañada?,"Concuerdo con que la gente lea tambien ""El manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano"". El libro de Galeano esta muy bien escrito, con muchas referencias, pero es anacrónico. Es como que los hispanoamericanos culpemos a los espanoles por nuestras desgracias. Si alguna vez fuimos victimas fue hace muchos anos (lo cual tampoco acepto). Lo que se necesita es trabajar duro y robar menos."
1,Rubbish,"I found this book full of lies and just plain rubbish. Victim mentality, poor me, look what you made me do.....of course HIS people are poor, abused, and mistreated while he looks so fat and unhealthy, it sickens me!! I want a refund."
4,"Good book, hard to read at times","Galeano points out some of the sobering points of history in regards to the Spanish domination of the New World. He tends to focus on the negative (which is fair in a lot of ways), but from what I understand from some of my teachers, this is not the best source of historical analysis on Latin America. The most important idea to take away from the book is how Europe acquired the capital from basically ""raping"" the New World which lead to the Industrial Revolution."
4,Only the informed open minded reader can appreciate this book,"In this era of world wide open communication, we can not afford to be blinded by our own dogmas and ideas. We must be open to the ideas of others. Not necessarily accept them but try to understand where they come from.I know Latin America first hand, I lived there many years of my life. I know that they many times have abusive governments and illiterate people (Not necessarily their fault). How ever, they have a point when they complain about the abusive exploitative approach that the American Corporations have had towards them. As well as the USA government intrusions to destroy democratically elected governments of this countries because they had a different ideology to ours.I recommend this book if nothing else to be better informed about the thought and sentiment of our neighbors to the south."
2,Good but needs an update,"this is a good starter to understand Latin America and it's cultural, political an social developments but for sure it's in many ways outdated. Besides, we've witness that all the so called ""pepes guerrilleros"" have been performing terrible bad once in power like the Sandinistas, or the dictatorship of the Castro's.Yes, imperialism does exist still but easy black/white answers like this book are not enough nowadays."
4,open veins of Latin America,This is a fabulous work of history. It reads like a novel so it is extremely readable. It is painful but so interesting it was hard to put down. This is the only book I have had stolen from me. (From my car!) That should tell a potential reader something.
5,This lays out the truths,"As U. S. citizens we may not want to hear the truth. Government, big business of Europe and the U.S. have benefitted from raping Latin America of the resources that represent the wealth of the people in each culture leaving the indigenous population without sufficient wealth for economic self sufficiency. Do we ever wonder why there is a steady path of illegal migrants to the U.S. willing to assume great risks for a better life? Read this book-- if you can secure a copy."
5,Outstanding Historical Account,"The truth hurts sometimes, but it is good that we become aware of it. A masterpiece which gives chilling details of the abuse some people have had to suffer."
1,"If you are simple, this book is for you.","If you lack the capacity for critical thought and require analysis to be spoon-fed to you then chances are this book will bolster your world view. If, however, you are reasonably intelligent and have the capacity to think for yourself then you will probably find the book a curious insight into a troubled individual's world view.I recommend Liberty and Tyranny instead."
1,Gee!!!,"This is a difficult book to read, not for its content but for the way is presented. I started reading this book since February and still (November)can`t find reasons to continue. There is a lot of great details and information but is all over the place. Mr. Galeano is obviously anti and he feel like the vast mayority of the problem that Latin America has faced thru the years are American made. Next time, I will try to read the Spanish version, hopefully it would be easier to digest."
1,Read it to see the lies we must combat,"Yes, one star is correct. I do not recommend buying it, but if you are truly interested in finding out what lying, murdering, dictators think of the United States, YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.It is packed full of the same form of rubbish that has been hurled at the United States by leftist dictators for decades; the US is evil, the US destroys lives in the third world, the US unfairly takes advantage of poverty stricken nations to feed their fat bellies.Well, last time I check the US is one of the most peaceful and prosperous nations on Earth. When was the last ethnic cleansing in the US? When was the last time tanks rolled over citizens in a peaceful demonstration? When was the last time we had a socialist leader (OK, lets scratch that question)?I do recommned reading this piece of fiction, but do not buy it, merely search the trash cans and I am sure you will find one from some other disgruntled reader who actually did waste his money."
1,The blame game...,This book goes on the same premise as many politically motivated individuals/governments in the world. Blame EVERYONE else for your own failures and inept leadership.
1,Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent,"Great fictional book. And obivously the lack of facts makes this a much better read for the hate the United States crowd. However, facts support the case that for most of Latin America, the best thing to ever happened to Latin America was the U.S."
2,degrading view of a most hospitable area of the world,"having family that were born in egypt and having visited and lived in egypt myself, i foudn this book to be a very degrading view of the egyptians and sudanese. yes, they are simple people by our standards but their hearts, words and actions more than make up for this. their lifestyle is one that we perhaps should look at adapting ourselves to rather and making fun of or simply marking primative. whilst i found this book had some interesting sections, on the whole i was rather embarrassed that a fellow aussie would have so little heart."
3,Not as good as her others I've read,"This one is shorter (just under 200 pages) and slighter. I was glad I got it out from the library, rather than purchasing a copy."
4,Terrific 80's pop!,"I was in high school at the time ""this island"" came out and I bought the vinyl. Being from the USA I had never heard ""Absolutely"". When I bought the CD I actually prefer ""Absolutely"" over ""This Island"". It is great to have both in one package. These two CD's contain great 80's pop. It is the kind of music that grows on you with each listen. If you like 80's pop with a little synth and a little guitar with female and male vocals, this is a great CD. Well worth the expense."
5,"Great cards , beautiful art!","I wasn't quite sure what I would get when I ordered this, but for the price I figured how could I go wrong? I wasn't disappointed. Beautiful detailed artwork on neat cards. Makes a great stocking stuffer. The pack contains twelve accurate, finely detailed cards (3"" x 4-1/4"") depicting American, British and Russian fighters: Spitfire MK XIVC, MIG-3, Grumman F6F Hellcat, plus nine more. Full color."
1,Picture is misleading,"The neck piece, just under the rope, in no way goes out to the shoulders and down the chest. It barely shows beneath the rope. Like the other reviews the hat is a joke. The picture shows a large pointed crown. The hat in the package is closer to a bowler. The material is cheap. It'll do the job but certainly wasn't worth the $50. I bought Burlap to cover the head piece and will use liquid latex to add the burlap texture to my face."
4,"Good costume, cheap hat","Costume is good, fit is more or less one size fits all on this one, if you are a large tall guy, may not work. I am 5'11"" and 165, fits fine for me and could easily go bigger in the waist for someone else. Rope I had to burn the ends to keep it from unraveling but to me this is minor for the cost of the whole costume. Hat is a joke, it is like a coffee filter coming out of the package, may thrown it in the dryer or something to see if I can get it not look like I am wearing an envelope on my head. :)"
4,Authentic looking...but material on thin side,"The costume looks authentic but the material is on the thin side when looked at closely. I think it would be nicer if it had more ""straw"" like material around the neck and feet and wrists. But, overall it gets the job done if your looking for a scarcrow for wizard of oz."
2,Bando Serpentine Drive Belt thru Amazon !!UPDATE!!!,"The Bando Serpentine Drive Belt purchased through Amazon is a great price/value purchase which was substantially more economical than the usual product obtained through the Lexus dealer and works just fine, as advertised....why pay more? and, it was promptly delivered within two days of order. Couldn't be more satisfied with the transaction! UPDATE!!!! After less than 8 months, this item failed (it broke with less than 5,000 miles of use (belt should last approx 60,000 miles. Perhaps after market item is not as good quality as original equipment."
5,WARNING Do not buy this part for your 2007+ Toyota Sienna,"I bought this product using the vehicle verifier/selector on Amazons website and when I went to install it (not fun unless you take the splash shield away and have a 14mm wrench and have about 30 minutes, it was Bigger than the original 7PK2090 that came off!!!- So I had to put the original belt back on. Check your old part number and order accordingly - Do not trust the Bando web site for reference!!!! BTW 7PK2170 (from Bandos web site will not work either!)"
5,Leapfrog Leappad Educ. Anna' First Ballet,Love this book. My daughter who is 3 loves it too.The only downside... the pages tear so easily.I would have preffered it more if the pages could not tear... and were made like the little touch books.Other then that. Great product.
5,leap pad book- Anna Ballerina,"WE LOVE LEAP PAD! Cute story, lots to offer, one great book after another."
5,Hannarific,This is a well filmed action film with heart pounding scenes. Cate Blanchett and Saoirse Ronan are awesome. The film is well acted and offers something for drama and action fans.
3,Fun,"Good action movie. Always fun to watch when someone has exceptional skills. Eight more words required, so here they are."
4,Good Movie,"I really liked this movie the first two times that I saw it. It does feel like it is missing something, but the settings/locations make up for it. The music is also interesting and was done by the Chemical Brothers."
5,Thought provoking and beautiful,"It's rare to see beautiful filmography in an action movie. And though it may be disingenuous to call this an action movie, it absolutely has the underpinnings of one and also has amazing visual artistic qualities.The story itself is going to polarize audiences. There will be two types of viewers: The type that sees an odd action movie and the type that sees a philosophical statement on life. Either audience is going to see the action and novelty aspects, but, as a member of the second group, the movie touches on some very relatable, tender points regarding the early stages of life and coming of age.The entire movie is wrapped around the vague notion of Grimm's fairy tales and though it doesn't attempt to draw any direct metaphors, they certainly allude to them along the way.This is the first movie in almost 10 years that I've intentionally watched multiple times in the theatre. It's an experience and it's as enjoyable the second time as the first.Highly recommended."
5,Shockingly under-appreciated,"I think the unusual european style and limited marketing hurt this film at the box office. It was easily the best, smartest action film of 2011. I don't buy many movies but this was a must-have. Excellent cast, acted, and some amazing cinematography from a director more known for costume dramas. Saoirse Ronan is amazing at making this unusual character come to life, and the action she is involved with is more believable than similar 'small girl beats up guys' movies like the Thai boxing film 'Chocolate'. The subway fistfight scene with Eric Bana is an amazing single edit tracking shot, I could watch it repeatedly."
5,Must Watch if,"I just saw this movie, it's worth seeing maybe even owning. It's a revenge movie on one hand, a action film on the other, and a fable all on in one."
3,"good start, bad from middle to end","I enjoyed the beginning. It set the stage for something interesting to come. Once the action started, it was so over-the-top fake and lame. It ruined the plot and what could have been a good movie."
3,Fun action movie with some cool set pieces,"Some of the motivations and plot points are a little vague and many of the characters are drawn as caricatures for no apparent reason but still, a fun action movie with a bit of a twist, some cool set pieces, and a few really good action sequences. The Chemical Brothers soundtrack combined with several extended scenes of running give aRun Lola Runfeeling to the film occasionally.You can check out Saoirse Ronan's survival skills in the earlierThe Way Backas well."
4,Arthouse spy thriller,"Wanted to see this since I heard Bana, Blanchett and Ronan would be teaming up with Joe Wright. Love the film's visual tyle and enjoyed the film except for one intense fight scene that abruptly ends without giving you its conclusion until later in the film. Smart action film."
3,Not quite what we expected,"We were very excited to rent this as soon as it was available. The previews made it look pretty intriguing, and we weren't disappointed.... for the first 45 minutes or so.Without ruining too much of the plot, the premise is that this girl is trained from a very young age to be an assassin. It goes much as expected for the first parts of the movie, with lots of action and impressive combat along with a thoughtful plot. Unfortunately, somewhere towards the middle, it seems that the writers forgot that Hanna was supposed to be an amazing killer. She spends the last half of the movie running away from people and generally letting us down in terms of originality, excitement, common sense, and action.Overall, it's an okay movie but I think the script needed some work. The actors are all superb and do an excellent job with what they were given, especially the main character's actress. Would recommend as a casual watch, but don't expect too much out of it."
4,Much better than expected!,"Think of the reverse of Alice in Wonderland, where a strange girl wanders into the normal world, but there is still an evil queen and her huntsman looking to catch her... Pretty good story overall and the soundtrack really added some punch (I'm not even a fan of Chem Bros)."
1,I HATE BD LIVE,"Package arrived safely. Product was in very good condition. (That why its gets one star at least) However CAN NOT BE PLAYED because this product has what is called BD Live which requires that your Blue Ray player be connected to the internet in order for you to enjoy it. Silly really. I could understand if you wanted to access ""special features"" but to have to pay for an internet connection just to watch a movie really BITES"
1,Dumb Dumb and DUMBER!!!!!,"Can you say a stupid, futile attempt to make an action movie? The whole premise of the movie is so stupid."
1,A slow moving train that never reaches a station,"I watched the preview and it looked good! I rented it on Amazon, hit play and was ready! For what? The beginning was good. While I was thinking how lucky I was to miss this guy as a father, it hit me; wait! it's OK because there's this button thingy and he's doing the right thing. She's ready! For what? The movie never gets past the first fight scene and never reaches any kinda of a thing resembling a plot. There are loads of questions along the way that are never answered and actions that make little to no sense. I got either this grating feeling of get on with it or an empty feeling of why did they do that or why is it relevant? This movie disappoints. I got to thinking I watched this movie for what? A plot would suffice as a beginning."
1,Disappointment,"I was really looking forward to this movie from the reviews and trailer. Purchased the Blue-Ray but now have buyers remorse after watching it. The movie starts out pretty good with the main character hunting and killing a caribou in the frozen north (Siberia perhaps - we never know). Shortly thereafter, it just gets stupid. Lots of scenes of the main character running, running, running with a wooden expression on her face. By the time something interesting took place I was long past the point of caring. The writers left the story wide open for a sequel, but I don't think I'll bother."
3,Not Bad,"The acting was pretty good in this movie and the story was pretty cool, so great fighting sequences. I only wish there could have been a little bit more to it...more action and whatnot, but it wasn't too bad. An average thriller. I did very much enjoy the Chemical Brothers music in it. Overall, worth a watch I think, but not sure it's one I would probably own."
3,meh...ok...,"The beginning and the end were atrocious...but the middle was pretty darn good. It definitely has that independent/low budget film feel, but the characters are well acted and the storyline was something new. It's difficult to come up with new stories these days, everything has been done at least once I feel like. But as I said, the beginning and the end were just terrible. **potential spoiler alert** The father and daughter wouldn't have been chased by the government if they hadn't pressed that stupid button...why they couldn't simply integrate themselves back into society quietly is beyond me. It would have been a better story if they had tried to do so, and failed. It was silly that they purposefully called attention to their whereabouts."
1,Is it over yet?,This was one of the worst films of 2011. It was long and pointless. There was no rhyme or reason within the plot development. Just plain awful. If you come across this film don't waste your time.
1,a confused mess of a movie,"With the actors it had, this movie should have been better than it was. I'm not even asking for great, just better. But it was a confused hash of a movie. What's with the different accents Cate Blanchett used? She starts off sort of European, then ends up with someone's Hollywood idea of what a Southern woman sounds like. It's a testimony to how stupid the entire movie was that all that stands out in my mind are the honeyed, phony-Magnolia accents on two of the female stars. What a waste of my two hours."
2,Doesn't lead anywhere,"Started out as an interesting, intriguing story line and then probably in an effort to not be banal, the director decided to twist the story and go literally nowhere. Too bad. The movie could have really been thought-provoking, because the action wasn't really good. The actors did their job of course, but the story didn't take you anywhere, the ending was depressing, offered no satisfactory explanation as to why the main characters acted the way they did. In the end, it wasn't even an average action flick."
2,B movie with very unrealistic plot and even worse- plot holes,Horrible movie. The plot is choppy and does not really follow much. Poorly written script. Had to force myself to sit through the rental.
1,Third Rate Movie,Did not see the girl train at all. She was expert the moment the movie started. The father stripped and swam an ocean in freezing waters. There was no backround on the girls father at all. It seemed to be a very poor effort to patch together a movie that could have been excelent if produced correctley.
2,Very Odd Movie,"Rented it for .99 on my kindle fire.The promo clip seemed interesting enough, but good lord was it a bizarre movie. I felt like you were chasing this jungle lady who was raised in the wild around the entire time and I really didn't feel that the ending summed up enough of her story as to how she became who and what she was.It has good action though and you do get to see a decent amount of Europe which is nice. If you like movies that leave you with a bunch of questions for you to assume your own conclusions than maybe this is for you. I perhaps and not smart enough to have grasped it though. I prefer things spelled out for me that are nice simple and end up tied with a pretty bow at the end."
2,"if you saw the trailer, you saw the movie","Very disappointing; the plot seemed non-existant, the best part is the picture on the case...piercing blue eyes that look through you."
2,"was hoping for great, ended with a fizzle...","I wanted this to be a good movie...The story line has the potential, but the directory's delivery and end scene of the movie leaves the viewer with an almost anti-climatic build up to...nothing exciting. Worth a redbox rental in my humble opinion, but not worth paying full price for."
3,So/So,"I liked but didnt like it but liked it but didnt. Its a hard one. I was slightly entertained but then slightly annoyed. The beginning of the movie draws you in...Alot of action but then it throws you for an annoying loophole. All in all, I might watch it again just to see if I missed something but I will pass on purchasing to keep."
5,Amazing,"Great action and intrigue movie, Gran pelicula una niña encantadora y letal te trasnporta a varios paises del Viejo continente y accion q nunca para."
5,Great movie,"This is a really fantastic movie. It is thrilling and adventurous and even funny at times. I really loved how well the story moved... how you had absolutely no idea what was going on and then it all made sense. Of course there are times when you wonder ""Why the heck did she do that? She could have just [insert logical scenario]."" But of course, it's a movie, so it's easy to forgive the characters for not following your advice. Overall, it is a really great movie. Hanna is a bad a** chick!!"
4,Hanna,"Very intertaining, fast with a good story. I would recomend this film. Kate Balanchet (spelling) is always good. I hope to see the leading actress again."
4,Great movie,This is a great movie. Good action and along the lines of noir intrigue...things aren't wrapped up in the standard Happy Meal fashion but end appropriately for the film...nothing too over the top but far enough out there to truly escape into an enjoyable action/intrigue film for a couple of hours. And I must add: the young lady who plays the lead role is absolutely outstanding. I look forward to her next piece of work.
1,You'd Better Like A Lot Of Previews,"""Hanna"" is so immature it should be rated reverse ""R"": Adult Guardian requires accompanying by 17 and under. For example, the Eric Bana character sets out to hike the Arctic in only a business suit.The Previews cannot be skipped and go on and on - reason enough to boycott the movie. Is ""The Fast and the Furious"" from 10 years ago a ""Preview""? Even worse, the ""Preview"" of ""Scarface"" is for a movie that's 30 years old !!!!!Isn't it nice to be manipulated and force fed studio ads, which add something that feels like 15 minutes of RT length, Go get dinner, there's plenty of time!"
4,Throwback to 1970s experimental film,"The plot is cogent and a bit predictable. What stands out is the lack of special effects and the energetic editing. It's all done in the camera and in the cuts. The throwback qualities of the visual would not be so obvious if it weren't for the Kraftwerk/Tangerine Dream style soundtrack, which sounds like 1982.Really cool filmmaking. Not impressively deep but exceptionally well executed and very kinetic. May become something of a cult classic due to certain mind-bending sequences which establish the film as the work of a director functioning as an auteur. It has a distinct and European visual language than we see in most action-oriented films these days, echoing classic films from the 1970s . Look up ""auteur theory"" if unfamiliar with the terminology of film criticism."
2,Major Disappointment,"This movie, on paper had everything going for it, a great cast including 2 of the greatest Australian actors on the planet, the sublime Ms.Cate Blanchett, the magnificent Mr. Eric Bana backed up by the stunning Ms.Saoirse Ronan. It had a pulsating soundtrack provided by the Chemical Brothers,it had action,stunning fight scenes, stunning locations , what went wrong? Simply a script that was jerky,messy and bloody awful backed up by poor direction. I really wanted to love this film but was so disappointed and can only give it 2 stars! Joe Wright after the greatness of Atonement you should hang your head in shame with this sub standard effort!"
2,Looked better in preview,"We bought this and watched it with our friends, I dont think any of us were impressed at all. The story line was lacking and it ended poorly. I was hoping for more content. I was very dissapointed."
2,"To Me, A Great Big Nothing!","Saw this in theater as lead to believe it would be this super James Bond type kid with revenge as her goal. Well, sat through movie but not sure why. A great big bust as very little ""James Bond"" action figure action. Wanted to like it but in the end, nothing here. What could have been...."
3,I wanted to like it,"Very interesting premise for a movie, but it was the ending that left me wanting more. Kate Blanchet is a wonderful actress and her southern drawl may be a bit heavy at times, but you would never guess she was english. There is also a lot going on with Kates character but we are only given snippets and no explanation of all the little quirks in her life.I would say more about the plot, but do not want to give anything away.."
1,Did not like it!,Not as good as the previews made it seem. Plot development was slow. Weird camera angles. Only redeeming quality was the few action sequences.
1,The bid rip off,"I ordered this movie about the 7th of September and I still haven't received it yet. Today is the 10th of October.I've contacted Crystal's Consumer Connection and they still haven't been able to get the item to me.I need a refund. I've already checked the movie out at the video store and watched it.Why do I need the movie now. I thought that I would get it earlier so I could tell people that I had seen it, but I can't do that now.Anyway the movie wasn't that great."
1,One of the worst movies,"I watched this movie mainly because the trailer was well made and the ranking was very high at IMDB (7.1 at that time with 20-30K raters). I was thrilled during the first 15 minutes then at the middle of the film I was already bored. I kept watching it hoping some good twist or surprise towards the end of the film. I was wrong, totally wrong. One thing I did learn from this movie is not to count on the reviews/ratings. But then, how and where can we get more objective opinions. It is not about the money wasted on this stupid film, but about the time and emotion you put in that 100 mins.I will never watch a movie directed by Joe Wright."
1,"Watch the trailer, then skip the movie.","Trailer got me interested in the movie, but that was a mistake. You saw the whole movie in the trailer and the parts they added for the movie were boring and, at times, very poorly produced. Skip it."
1,Too much hype,"I was really excited to watch this movie. The previews were pretty awesome but once i saw it I was left wanting back the time I spent watchig it. The best parts are in the trailer. It felt like some aweful indie film. The acting was great, just the story (it had potential) and how it came off through the lense was not decent enough."
2,Ok but not great,"Overall the movie is entertaining to watch with some great action scenes. However I did feel that there was some part of the story I was missing. The movie lacked fluidity from chapter to chapter or lacked substance. The main characters of good and evil were not convivincing enough in their roles as ruthless assassins, something was lacking - may be because I have seen them in their alternate roles."
2,Disappointing - enough with the arty overlay,The film had a great concept but in many places the execution was poor. Often became aware of cast acting and the scenes looked very manufactured. What a shame considering the cast available. The pace was so often stalled with arty sections that the whole pace was painfully disjointed.
5,Not just another cookie cutter movie,"Some here decry Hanna because of its ""incomprehensible"" storyline. The story isn't hard to understand though. What they're really complaining about, I think, is that the movie doesn't follow one of the Hollywood formulas we see all the time. Well, I say to them, ""go watch Transformers,"" and leave the rest of us to enjoy this film."
2,weird,"too many holes in the plot in order to believe it, even with suspension of belief. could have been so much better."
3,Suspension of disbelief required for this one.,"(SPOILERS CONTAINED IN REVIEW)Drone teenager is trained to grow up to become an assassin and kill her mother's killer. While dodging bullets on her first mission and never missing a shot she discovers the outside world, having been locked in a cabin in the woods all her life. The mission to kill her mother's killer does not begin until she throws a homeing becan device which will alert her mother's killer to her location. Duh... yeah that's always a good move for an assassin right? Im believing all this :P The movie opens with some good action scenes but what follows is an action movie that stalls in both story and believable action. Check out the 1991 movie Lafemme Nikita if you want to see this genre done better."
5,Art and Action- who would've thought,"It is really not possible to classify this film. Wrapped in the action movie genre, it is really a composition with each piece and scene crafted for effect. Unlike Inception and Avatar it does not rely on CGI special effects. Real people, real situations, for the most part. It shows that Saoirse Ronan's Oscar Nomination at age 13 for her role in Atonement was not a fluke.Beauty and evil, innocence and horror are all in display, often in the same character. A child one moment, a hunter the next, vulnerable then detached. Add a Peter and the Wolf type theme that's bound to get stuck in your head and an excellent use of music in the film.When I saw the movie in the theater, I liked it but was very conflicted, which is what I believe the film was trying to achieve. It was a film I continued to think about for awhile after seeing it. Not earth shattering but an effective morality piece whose message did not smack you in the head."
2,Should have been Good,"Before I watched this movie, I thought it would be an exciting one. Hanna is a girl raised by her father in the woods. She learns everything there is to know about survival and protecting herself from any threats (human or not) from her father. Her father is an ex-CIA agent.The first part of the movie was good. However, the rest (or most) the movie was very predictable. The plot was basically a one big chase, and the final showdown. Another problem with this movie was over the top sound effects and the music, both of which was very distracting. This movie was made in such a way that the viewer would have to fill in lots and lots of blanks without questioning any of it. At some point you think it is just not worth it.There is some action in it, but nothing like the Bourne series."
5,We saw this in the theater. Thriller to the max. Super,"We watched the trailers and were spellbound. Too many movies today are essentially the ""trailer"", but not Hanna. If i were ship wrecked on an island and could choose 10 movies, Hanna would be in the top 5. The movie makes you think, and laugh so hard, you might need a break for the toilet. And if i could have Hanna with me on that Island life would be grand. She is an innocent with skills and a mind set that trips you out. She knows so many things that she doesn't even know she knows. Hanna takes ""home schooling"" to a higher bar. I hope they have a sequel. Several sequels. Watching Hanna on DVD tops the theater. You can rewind to see a scene you thought you comprehended, but as you re-watch, you see Hanna as the perfect person. She is the Honey Badger of women. You will not regret watching this."
4,Interesting Movie,"Would watch it again. Interesting movie, had a varied story line. Great action sequences, and the humanization of a killing machine."
4,Stylish action flick,"The basic plot has been done: ex-agent seeks revenge. It gets the action going nicely. Despite its common beginning, however, 'Hanna' rises well above its genre. Cate Blanchett does a great job in her hard-edge spymaster role. Eric Bana plays a minor part in the drama, however large his part in getting the plot under way. Saoirse Ronan, however, walks away with the title role. Her delicate features and lean grace seem at odds with her vicious role, and the director makes the most of that contradiction. The paradox only builds when Hanna connects with another young girl - the contrast of one girl's chatty, knowing daydreams with the other's gritty and uncertain nightmares might make you look at any girl differently, knowing that both extremes might lie within one young frame.Think of a kitten: cute, yes, but trained by its parents to kill. Hanna is that kind of kitten.-- wiredweird"
5,Hanna,This movie was great to watch. Our family loved the action and plot. This movie is on our favorite's shelf. I hope you all enjoy it too.
3,iT WAS COOL A STRECTCH TO BELIEVE BUT COOL,"IT WAS ENTERTAINING TO SAY THE LEAST, I CAN SOMEWHAT IMAGINE A LITTLE GIRL KICKING GROWN MEN'S ASSES BUT NOT LIKELY"
3,Not a total waste of time.,I was expecting more from this movie. Some of the back story was overexplained and some was barely touched on at all. Not a total waste of time but when the movie ended I was left feeling it needed more.
3,Slightly entertaining,"The idea of a child assassin is certainly an interesting one. Especially when it's a young girl that was raised in a forest. You really have no idea what is happening through most of the movie. You know someone is going to try to capture and/or kill Hanna & she must kill them first. As the movie goes on you learn who they are and little bits of information are fed to you here & there. But even knowing what we are told, it still doesn't really explain the entire story. With a fragmented storyline, it was hard to really enjoy the movie. The actress that played Hanna was wonderful. Some of the fight scenes were a little hard to believe. They look choreographed & it was hard to believe she was doing any real damage to grown men. If they had concentrated more on her brains & speed, it would have been more realistic. The acting was great, the storyline not so much, and the end just left me wondering ""Now what?"". Disappointing movie overall but a little entertaining."
4,Coming of Age,Hanna is a coming of age story. It starts off with great potential. Once Hanna enters the world that she has never known she operates easily in it for the most part but has difficulties with other things. What she does not understand about the world she never knew is not consistent. She should either have known more or much less. This inconsistency provides confusion. There is plenty of action. Hanna is a likeable character. It is good entertainment if you do not want to take it too seriously.
1,Hanna,"This film is without any value as a story or as a film. It is filled with senseless Follywood violence, very poorly written, badly acted and filmed cheaply and poorly.I feel dirty and stupid for having watched it."
1,Crap,"This movie is trash. The actors are no good, the filming isn't good at all & what's with the psychidelic music?! Waste of time & Eric & Kate's talent. Who rated it with 4 stars...it's creators?!"
1,Disappointed,Horrible. This movie sucks and was a huge waste of time. Very disappointed. Don't waste your money. Buy Killer Klowns From Outer Space instead on blu ray.
4,DVD was a gift.,Hanna was a gift for my sister. When she received it something was rattling in the box!! Upon opening the package she found the middle of the DVD holder was broken. The DVD played fine..no sign of scratches.
3,IT JUST MISSED MY HEART,"HANNA is beautifully filmed and directed with artful precision by Joe Wright. The musical score by the Chemical Brothers is marvelous. The performances from Saiorise Ronan, Eric Bana and Cate Blanchett are excellent. The movie's opening and closing line - ""I just missed your heart"" - is chilling. Likewise, the script does a good job in establishing Hanna's sudden insertion into a world quite alien to her, and her affinity to the vacationing family.But in the end, HANNA left me feeling cold and detached. The cruelty of secluding and training a teenage girl to be a vengeful assassin is unjustified and reprehensible. HANNA is a well done film but not a pleasant movie experience."
5,"Awesome film, very stylish. Saoirse Ronan is fantastic.","Very, very impressed with this film at the cinema. Great visuals, good acting and an excellent plot. Strangely I've never completed watching any of the Bourne films but this film gives me the incentive.I think Saoirse Ronan is going to be one of the leading actresses of the future.Recommended. If you're not sure of purchasing you can always use Instant Video or Netflix.Cheers"
2,good movie bad seller,I have seem the movie before I tried to buy it and I love it. But when I bought it it didn't work in my Dvd player. When I tried to contact the seller I couldn't find anything under his product.
1,HORRIBLE,This movie make know sense.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!
1,Hanna,Not a small wonder this movie is in video already. Its a sad state of affairs when a movie this bad even makes to the theaters and so many people liked it; are they getting paid to write these reviews. There were some magical scenes like when she is in a hole and Hummvees are passing over at 60 mph then the next scene she holding on to the bottom of it magically. That was a ripoff.
1,Lame with a capital L,"A well photographed, well acted, quirky, esoteric film that goes no where, with characters that meant nothing to me. Cate Blanchet was obviously contractually obligated to be in the nonsense. All the cool music, great sets, fantastic locations, and odd audio in the world will not supply a story for a film that has none. Sorry. This film was a zero and it implied zero all throughout. Episodes of Adventure Time with Finn and Jake have more to tell and say than this canned ham of a film did."
2,Brutal film for young adults,This was a more brutal film for young adults then I thought i would be. I yhought it would be more like an agnet film then it was.
2,Disappointed,from watching the promos that were shown on television I expected a movie filled with action. Most of the actio was shown on the promos. This was really a coming of age movie about a girl whose father just happened to be in the CIA. If I had known that I would not have bought the BluRay DVD. Wasted money.
3,just ok for me,"I saw the previews and was looking forward to watching Hanna, a dna created ultimate soldier that's also a weird albino chick. I watched today and thought it was average at best. Rent it if you're curious"
2,Dissapointing,"Wow ,what a dissapointment.The first twenty minutes i was thinking,this is gonna be a great movie.Oh boy was i wrong.The rest of the movie is meaningless scenes of her traveling with a family that reminds me some weird clockwork orange film.The music reminds me of a rave party and the cinemetography makes me think of willy wonka and the choclate factory (johnny depp version).I wish i new waht i was watching but nothing really ties together and the story line never develops.watch the first twenty minutes and the last ten then return it."
3,Too artsy to be enjoyed as a spy vs. spy,"Hanna (Saorirse Ronan) is raised in an aortic type of wilderness (actualy Finland) to keep her safe from the outside world until she decides she is ready. Once she decides she is ready for the world it may not be the world she imagines.We travel along with her as she learns about family, friendship, and love. She also learns about her past and we speculate on her future.The problem is this film is way to artsy to just be a shoot, slice and bludgeon them up. It spends more time on unique music that is much louder than the dialog. Pictures of vast panoramas that is inconsequential to the story.The Blu-ray DVD extras are the standard how it is made and whet they are trying to say and do not quite get there. They even made the cabin as a work of art.Look up Hanna""The soul of man has been given wings"""
5,Absolutely the Best Movie I've Seen This Year,"This isn't a movie where the plot is completely laid out for you. It gets the juices flowing, if you know what I mean. This is not your typical action movie. It's thought-provoking. How often does anyone refer to anything that Hollywood pumps out as, ""Thought-provoking?""The cinematography and editing choices are completely unique (that's a good thing). It works well with the Chemical Brother's soundtrack. Very cool to watch the successful collaboration between both director and artists.Thoroughly enjoyed."
1,Very Bad Movie.,"Disapointed flick that lacks theme and development. The disjointed story never goes anywhere. I do not wish to summarize it because it is not possible. Rent it, do not buy it."
1,Endless middle,"An intriguing 20-25 minute beginning, and then our character stumbles upon, ostensibly the Morrocon desert. The next hour is a waste of time you will never get back, such that when you arrive at the end, you will in no way care about the completely predictable ending."
1,Could have been so good,"This isn't a show that makes you like any of the characters, or root for any of them. There's a lot of senseless death and running around in a daze. There's no good point to the show, not even a bad one. No good guys get rescued, and nobody cares. What a waste of money and time. This show sucked. You'll be sorry if you buy it, if you want to waste your dollar rent it at red-box and then regret not just getting a coke. What a waste!"
1,Terrible,"Was expecting a fun, violent revenge movie...got something else...something really, really bad. The acting was decent, especially the lead, but the plot was horrendous and the characters acted completely irrationally."
5,its a vaughan,One of the finest hammers out there. Extremely tough and well balanced. Vaughan 999s are all that i buy.
4,Amazing mellow vocalist,"The more you listen, the more you appreciate the music of Roy Orbison. Most of the songs are quite emotional but lively. Background instrumental music is also amazing. Video is not quite perfect, but what matters most to me is the audio.Highly recommended. To see is to believe, find out for yourself."
3,Can't Stop listening to Can't Stop the Rock,"Yes, there are some glaring ommisions from this collection, as is often the case with ""best of"" albums, but listening to these songs brought back fond memories of the mid-late eighties, which is always fun for me. The new tracks are good too, although the sound is more ""early 90's"" than most of their best work.I've always admired these guys for their boldness in bringing The Message to a crowd that might otherwise have ignored it."
3,Compilation,"This is a compilation of Stryper's best material circa 1991 before they broke up, presumably for singer Michael Sweet's solo career. There are two new previously unreleased studio tracks. For diehard Stryper fans, it's not bad, and includes Lady, easily one of their best songs from the Against the Law album. Other highlights are: Honestly, To Hell With the Devil and You Know What to Do. There is another Stryper compilation also with two new tracks, 7: The Best of Stryper. One of the first openly Christian bands with a substantial following, some Christian leaders have insisted heavy metal could not be used to promote Christianity. They still continue to record today after a long hiatus from this ""best of"" compilation."
5,"Wohlfahrt - Book 1, edited by Alqouni","This edited book produced from Carl Fisher is a good book for different bowing exercises, especially to drill students to play full bow, play at frog and tip of the bow, and various parts of the bow. It is also good to train students to play with good intonations. Please note that all exercises are in 1st position only.As a violin teacher, I have recommended it to several students for beginners and up to almost intermediate levels for good bowing training, pitch and improve sight reading too. I also used it particularly to correct students who have played with bad bowing techniques and bad bowing habits previously."
2,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I was excited to see how Rachel Barton Pine would play the current study I was working on and I thought even though I already had the book (Wohlfhart op 45 sixty studies), the dvd and the info it contained would be worth the extra money. When I received the book and dvd however, I found that the book was not the ""standard"" wohlfarht sixty studies op. 45 that every violin teacher I know uses - and that I was led to believe this book was as well - this book is a blend of studies from op. 45, 54, and 75 - and really doesn't contain very many of the studies from the original op. 45 book. The description on amazon does not mention this fact and in my mind is a bait and switch. While I'm sure that the book and its exercises will help your playing and it will be interesting to see how Rachel plays the pieces, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK THINKING THAT YOU ARE BUYING THE STANDARD BOOK OF WOHLFAHRT STUDIES!!!!"
4,Good indie film,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good this film is. To me, it's what indie films are meant to be."
3,Cute little road pic with politics thrown in,"Under the veneer, this is an old fashioned road picture, replete with numerous encounters with wacky people en-route: reactionary parents, funny border guards, burned out draft dodgers and crazed Canadians bent on marrying Americans. The plot is based on a clever idea: what if someone actually did move to Canada in 2004 after Bush won the election? Many threatened to do so. How many really did? The romance between the left-wing blogger and the blue-hair dyed girl does begin to have some heat after awhile. For an indie, this is quite comfy watching."
4,Eden,"Like much of Robert Adams work, this book at first appears transparently ordinary--photographs of a truck stop somewhere in the middle of nowhere--but somehow resonates with memories. There is the irony of the name of the place cast against the bleakness of the photographs--but Adams claims that no irony is intended. But my own memeories called out by this book are of long car trips before air conditioning, the smell of hot engine oil, of cars overheating, the taste of cold coke in a bottle, and the smell of diesel engines long before anyone thought of air polution. The biblical Eden was a place of perfection before the fall, but these pictures must refer to the same place at some later time, after the the tree was cut to make way for the interstate."
4,Nice well detailed model,I got one that had the new tooling and the detail was greatly improved over older models. If you are a fan of the Yamato or Musashi this is a must have as it is a sister ship. A photoetch kit makes it look even better.
5,Even better than the MOFI release,Forget about the regular release of this disc. It the best sounding version out there. DCC have made this disc so good it's even better than the MOFI release. Putting a price tag on a difference in quality is always difficult but when you want the best and have the money to spend than you've got to buy this one!
5,A Night to Remember,"This is it, folks! Rock has seen no finer! ""A Night at The Opera"" is an event, not the release of more ""product"". It showcased exactly what Queen could do with the best of their abilities. Ask yourself what other CD you can get ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""The Prophet's Song"" on? Each song on this CD is special in its own way. If you are a serious music fan, this is a must! You're definately NOT a Queen fan if you do not own this. God Save The Queen!"
5,Amazing!,"This album is simply amazing. Freddie Mercury's vocals sound incredible on every song. This album defiitely showcases the band's versatility, they can do everything from the operatic ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon"" to more metal-y songs like ""Sweet Lady"". There isn't a song on the CD I don't like. A must-have for lovers of all musical genres; there is something for everyone on this album. Five and a half stars!-Bohema"
5,great title,"from track one ""deathj on two legs"" it starts with a bang. It moves on with great tunes like ""39"" and ""im in love with my car"" It finally closes with the show stopping hit ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" This si a great cd. Portrays Queen like never before."
5,A Classic Album!!,"From start to finish this album is great to listen to. It has great lyrical, harmony, & musical quality. The album appears to have a little satire (Death on Two Legs - Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon, Good Company, & Seaside Rendezvous) to great story telling of love and adventure (I'm in love with my car, You're My Best Friend, '39,) with a touch of the dark (The Prophet's Song and Bohemian Rhapsody) thrown in. A great album for the ages!!"
5,Excellent,"A Night at the Opera is a great album, and not just because of the mega-hit Bohemian Rhapsody either. Songs such as You're My Best Friend, I'm in Love with My Car, '39 and Prophet Song are great tracks. A few of the songs are quite odd, but don't hurt the album at all. A must have for any Queen collection."
4,The best studio album,"Okay, everyone bought this in 1975 for Bohemian Rhapsody. That, in and of itself, makes this album a great buy. If you don't know a lot about Queen, you might be in for a bit of a suprise by the whole album. Queen always dabbled in experimentation with music and vocals. They basically covered everything from rock to country to disco. Casual fans would want to get Classic Queen and Queen's Greatest Hits. The true fans always have this one ready to go."
5,A Master Piece,"Queen are my favourite band, and I think this album is probably one of their best. When I first heard this album I was amazed! It is such a great Album. All the tracks are fantastic and they live up to the Queen Phenomena. Death On Two Legs, The Prophet's Song and Bohemian Rhapsody are just simply the best, I'm not downing all the other tracks but these are my top 3. This album is just the best, even if you're not a Queen fan you'll love it!!!!"
2,Could be better,"The CD is great Queen, However, the editing is okay at best. Death on two legs cuts off early. About 3 seconds early. Other songs cut. I think for the money charged, it should have been better edited."
4,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A Night at the Opera is good, but definitely isn't great.Basically because of the lack of great songs on the album.Now with good but not great songs like the overrated ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and a ambundance of just mediocre songs like ""Sweet lady"" and ""'39"" just doesn't let ""ANATO"" fall in to the great catagory the really only great song on ""ANATO"" is the much underrated ""the Prophets song"".Bottom line a couple of good songs isn't enough to carry an album into greatness."
3,ok but there is better cds out there,"I have this the two best of's classic queen, greatest hits and news of the world the only reason i have these cds is because of freddy mecury's voice. The one big complanit about queens lps is that freddy does not sing lead on all the songs. Brian May is ok he sounds like a weaker freddy but Rodger Taylors voice blows he sounds like a crappy version of Rob Halford to bad the song I'm in love me my car would be good if Freddy sang it. I really only remeber like 3 songs on this the two that everyone has heard a millon times of rock radio and love of my life which is so pretty. Manily i like the fact that this band can rock but i tend to like the ballads even the chessey ballads from the 80s that this band did well maybe except the song miracle and It's a kind of magic. Long story short would anyone like this band if it was not for Freddy Mecury he is the band Queen."
4,Vinyl is so much better,I've always been a fan of vinyl records and the newer weight vinyl is even better. This has always been a great album and it sounds as warm as i expected it to.
5,I wish I could give it more...,"Without a doubt, this album is among the best albums of rock-and-roll ever recorded. ""Bohimian Rhapsody"" is, of course, epic and very ""Queen."" But I most definatly think that ""The Prophet's Song,"" however long it is, takes the cake with this album. It truly saddens me that it never really got the recognition it deserves. Freddie Mercury's voice is unmatched by any artist to date. All in all, the album is the greatest gem that Queen ever mined from the mountian of their talent. And what a mountian it is!"
3,I recommend Queen II,"I was a Queen fan back in 1974 and bought the Bohemian Rhapsody single, which I still have somewhere in its original cover. But when it came to buying ANATO I was in for a disappointment. The album was too eclectic for my taste, varying from hard rock to Noel Coward. It's emotionally superficial. The trend continued with ADATR, which was the last Queen album I bought for a long time. Having said that, I saw Queen at Alexander Palace in London, in the early eighties and it was probably the best rock concert I've ever attended!I highly recommend Queen II, which is more cohesive, more imaginative, more consistent."
4,Great Sound,"This disk sounds great in surround. Even the DTS is good. However, is it just my copy or is there a skip in Good Company on the DTS track near the end on the line ""take care of those you call your own"" (repeats ""your own"" and doesn't sound natural doing it). The disk doesn't have any scratches on it and I don't have a CD to compare the song to. I also just wanted to say that all features on the disk such as the video and the photo-gallery are accessible if you just have DVD-Video with DTS."
3,Queen is great but the Vinyl pressing falls short,"It's been a long time since I purchased a new LP recording. With all I've heard about how Vinyl recordings are so much better now, I expected a good sounding Album with good HiFi quality music . What I got was a very scratchy, popping, hissing recording that ruined my enjoyment of the music.My first inclination was to send it right back but on the advise of some friends I tied cleaning up the record and taking out the static. The second playing was better and after more cleaning I finally got a good sounding album. After doing all that work I igured that I might as well keep it.Doing all this cleaning and conditioning of an LP album is what I expect to do when I buy a record in a yard sale for a few bucks, not a brand new recording from a trusted merchant. If merchants expect us to pay $20 and up for a brand new vinyl album, they are going to have to do a much better job with quality control."
3,Not As Good As Everyone Says,"Sorry, but what is all the hoopla about this album? The only good songs are Bohemian Rhapsody, You're My Best Friend, and Love of My Life. The first two you can get on their greatest hits albums. The rest of the songs are just plain silly and lack real musical talent. The Game is clearly their best album, not this piece of garbage. Save your money for Greatest Hits and The Game."
1,this is awful!,we need to have better songs...bohemian rhapsody is an awful song! it is one of the worst songs ever! i do NOT like freddie mercyry's voice! death on two legs is the best song in this album! and of course sweet lady...a song about me?
1,Bland,Queen don't rock! And A Night At the Opera is a perfect example of why not. Far too pretentious to be considered rock. Avoid!
4,Some of you may disagree with that......,"....or maybe it's just because I've heard it too many times ;)This album, obviously, was the most popular, but it isn't Queen at it's best. Although most people have only heard 'Bohemian Rhapsody' (and certainly it's a great song) they should pick up a copy of Sheer Heart Attack or something and see what they think then.On the A-side, 'Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon' is my favorite, as it is an original type song that they didn't have on any other record, a short little nice-ety. 'Seaside Rendevous' was another nice one (Freddie's voice is soo nice in this one)On the B-side my favorite was 'The Prophet's Song' because I loved how they layered the voices in that one part. If I remember Queen, I remember that little part the most. 'Bohemian Rhapsody' was alright and 'Love Of My Life' was great too.. In 'Good Company' I like how Brian uses the banjo-ukelele thing.So, in other words, way too over-rated but a great one."
5,The best!,About the best album of all time. If you have never listened to this before you have missed musical talent of the highest caliber.
4,A Night With The Remasters,"Well, I have to tell ya, very good but as the remasters creep out, it appears they start to sound more the same as the original remastered disc's. I did think they sounded somewhat better though but if I was buying for the first time, I'd get these or if like myself, collected them, I'd get them. Probably the real find on this one is the bonus CD tracks. One though has been released before ""Keep Yourself Alive Lost Retake"" and the others well, nice to have in digital form. Love Of My Life (South American Live Single) makes it's digial debut here where it was previously released as a single. Well, in the long run, I recommend it, if not for the regular album then the bonus CD.Drop by my website sometime and say ""Hi"" @ 'Judemac Forever""."
4,Raul Jose's Review,"From listening to his many recordings, Romero Lubambo is an awesome guitarist. However, in this ""solo"" CD, I was slightly disappointed that my lofty expectations were not met. The virtuosity and musicianship were there, but the arrangements gave me a bit more ""exploratory"" feel than I usually prefer."
2,I will return it back !,This software seems to be great but I WILL RETURN IT BACK TO AMAZONE.COM! You might ask why? the answer is so simple ! I cannot use this software since non of my ISP support SMTP server address (YOU NEED SERVER SETUP-You cannot use it as any other software on your computer) and what makes me feel bad that this basic requirement was not explained in product information and system requirement @ Amazone.com If you want to buy this product double check with your ISP and server administrator before you order it.
3,Pretty good...,"... but still, my first impression is not so good, because some of the examples don't compile under KDE 2.1. This makes them useless. The book provides, on the other hand, very good introduction to Qt/KDE, with focus on basic functionality (no multimedia, etc.)."
4,At least all the episodes are here!,"If you are Cheers fan, obviously this is a must have. Where else can you get every episode from the first season in one package? The lack of extras is unfortunate, but the reason I purchased the set and the reason I watch it is for the show itself.Sadly, though, the episodes are not presented in their original order. How hard would it have been to put episodes 1-6 on disk 1, and so on? What's episode 7, Coach's Daughter, doing placed as the second selection of disk one? I may not watch every episode in order every single time I view the disks, but upon my first viewing I would have liked if I could watch the episodes in order without switching disks until I completed each disk."
5,One of the Best Seasons of One of the Best Shows,"One of the best seasons of One of the Best Shows February 28, 2003The acting and writing is some of the finest to grace the airwaves. Diane as played brilliantly by Shelly Long is a real treat. It took many characters to try to replace the vacuum left after she departed the series. In truth the show was not the same without her, but the entire series is well worth collecting. The show is a wonderful depiction of a diverse group of customers and employees that come together in something of a surrogate family in Boston Bar. This portion of the series also functions as a great romantic comedy fueled by stellar chemistry between Diane and Sam as polar opposites that attract. Very sharp humor and great dialogue punctuate the series. One of the ten best television shows of all time. The best TV DVD package released to date. These shows are highly repeatable and worth owning."
4,Really glad I bought this...,"I've always loved ""Cheers"" (especially the Sam / Diane years). I knew that I would enjoy this box set. But, I was taken back by how well this show was written. I was barely a teenager when Season 1 aired. I got the basic jokes then, but the subtle humor elluded me, until now.I will probably watch the 22 episodes again in the near future while I'm biding time for Season 2.I gave only 4 stars because the extras were on the soft side. But, face it, I bought it for the episodes. Well worth it."
3,"Good Stories, but Not Funny","Let's face it, this show features some pretty pathetic characters, most of them not very likeable. You have Sam, the washed-out reformed alcoholic bartender who chases everything with a skirt, Diane is certifiable, Rebecca is a loser, Cliff is a big know-it-all, Frazier is as pompous as a human being can be, Carla is a rude waitress. If she had worked for me, I probably would have fired her on her first day. And Norm? Comatose. Coach and Woody are sweet, likeable guys, but they're out to lunch most of the time. And the situations that pop up there are more pathetic than funny. Diane and Sam's (and later Rebecca's) romance is a joke. For some reason, though, I find myself watching these shows at least once a year. The stories are captivating, but, in the final analysis, not very good for chuckles. Seems like every episode features at least one or even a few of these characters making fools of themselves. If you can get past all that, it's entertaining."
5,Is a review really necessary?,"I'm not going to bore you with my usual long, technical review. I'm not going to bore you with a review of a television series that speaks for itself. What I will do is say this....in a nutshell, there is absolutely NO REASON for you NOT to buy this DVD. If you are a fan of Cheers, the first minute of watching Episode One, you will be watching with your mouth opened...literally...like I did. From the beautiful stereo sound of the theme music, to the vibrant colors of the remastered film (especially if you have a component set-up), you will be filled with ""wow"" and ""oh my gosh"" as you step back in time. This DVD package is a MUST BUY for any fan of Cheers. Just be warned about one thing, the episodes are not in the order in which they were aired for some strange reason. Other then that, step back to a time when TV was at its absolute perfection...and step into a place where everybody knows your name. Enjoy!!"
5,Great pix quality on the DVDs I received!,"I don't undestand why alot of the reviews are about poor picture quality.Mine are great on Season One.There's no lip syncing at all and the picture is very clear.I don't know if it depends on who the DVD was ordered frommatters or not, but the set I got was beautiful.I loved watching all over again the situation Diane found herself inafter the snobby Sumner Sloan left her in. (the cad!)It was great meeting the Cheers gang again after all these years!If you love Cheers I defintely advise ordering the set."
3,not for new ipods,"I ordered is item thinking it would fit the iskin on my 2nd gen nano and it doesn't. This is for older ipods as it doesn't fit my 30 gig ipod, either."
4,Great show - picture quality only okay,"Great classic Lucy - guest stars are top notch - Phil Silvers, John Wayne, George Burns, Don Rickels etc. Picture quality is only okay, no subtitles or chapter breaks. Still worth while for the great guests."
3,pills too big and clunky,"I think the product works but as I said above...pills too harsh and when I broke them in half, they crumble a bit. So design a capsule that is ""user friendly""."
4,Seems ok,The product was shipped promptly. Although the pills are big the texture seems smooth enough so that I usually don't have too much problem swallowing them. I agree with some previous reviews that the labeling is a bit misleading. At a glance you would think that each pill is 400mg. Overall I am happy with the product.
3,"It's not that potent, maybe just old",It is within the expiration date but doesn't seem to have the same effect as the bottles I bought at the doctors office. Yes read the labels closely on these things. You'll need two large pills to get the dosage advertised.
2,Not a fan,"After hearing all the hype about Mag Glycinate, I decided to purchase this KAL Brand at the local Vitamin Shoppe. MG Gly is suppose to be at the top as far as bio availability from what I have read. I took this version also because it is suppose to be easy on the stomach. I can tell you from MY experience, this is not the case. I would take 1-2 pills a night before bed and just about every night I would wake up locked up or cramped in my stomach. After getting fed up with this feeling and just the nauseousness that I got from taking these, I went to a Vitamin World in my area and purchased Magnesium Citrate which is just as bio available and has caused me zero problems overall. If I were you id pick up the Mg Citrate first and give it a try. It cost half the price of what you can purchase glycinate for."
3,Magnesium Glycinate,"I take Kal Magnesium Glycinate 400 Mg and find it very hard to swollow. The pill is huge! I tried cutting it in forths but then it crumbles. It is the only supplement that sells for a reasonable price, I pay $13 for 90 pills. It would be nice if they would coat the pill with something that makes it slide down easier or perhaps made it in liquid form. The usual dose is 400 mgs a day. I end up taking only 200 rather than go through the hassle of cutting it up twice a day."
2,HUGE PILLS!!!!,"These pills are annoyingly huge and hard to choke down. who the heck is going to keep with a magnesium regimen if it means gagging a few times a day every day? I dont understand how this kind of product makes it to market without someone going ""hmmm.....maybe choking our customers is a bad idea"". Going to look for a capsule form."
3,Not that hot.,"I honestly find it hard to believe this book was rated the full value of stars. I found it so predictable, I knew who the so-called missing suspect/killer was as soon as one character was given so much description over the others, and that was just their clothing. It was a dead giveaway. The dialogue was halting and I just didn't find myself connecting with the chatacters. Kate feels guilt, yeah sure, but it all popped up so suddenly I couldn't sympathize with her at all.Although, it's not a horrid book. I'd suggest it if you want a night's murder mystery to read. I don't mean to make it out to sound like it's not a good read, give it a try, it wont be the worst you've ever read."
1,THESE DONT LAST LONG AT ALL,We keep having to buy these for our two kitchen light fixtures ..Home Depot. Cant find the bulb in the store..but cant tell you how many bulbs we have gone thru in 2 years. The bulbs dont even last a whole month. TERRIBLE waste of money.We will have to get new light fixtures as these bulbs are costing us a lot of money. ( the lights were in the home we just bought 2 yrs ago ) DO NOT BUY THESE BULBS.
2,Came nowhere near rated hours,Not much to say about these. They light the room like a bulb should but most of them have failed within a few months. I've seen this with numerous FEIT electric CFL products I've purchased from Costco over the years. They all seem to fail well before their rated hours.
5,Road Construction Ahead,"The publication, ""The Parents Guide To The Best Family Videos"", rated Road Construction Ahead in the top ten for the best films for toddlers and preschoolers!"
5,Great Product,"I bought this for my wife from my youngest son for Christmas one year. Out of all the gifts, this has still hung around and gotten used."
2,Master Teacher?,"I purchased this DVD based on the reviews it was given on Amazon. However, there is something about the participants in the video that just didn't sit well with me. They didn't feel authentic. The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the teacher of this group of people is called the ""Master Teacher."" If it were truly A Course In Miracles material, I doubt that the teacher would call himself the Master Teacher. The only Master Teacher the Course In Miracles would support is Jesus or The Holy Spirit. I would not recommend this DVD."
1,Don't confuse this dvd with a a course in miracles...,"To each his own. I'm sure. But marketing this as a course in miracles dvd is incorrect. This is a small cult run(or WAS run) by a man who claimed to be the Master Teacher (Guru). The course specifically urges us to avoid this type of situation. End of story. Some people find comfort in cults, intelligent people do not. The course is not supposed to be a church with a pope at the top. And that's not my opinion, that's what the course actually says. I think people should be warned, therefore I write this review."
2,"Kind of bizarre, Opinion from a Course in Miracles student","I didn't enjoy this. I have been a student of the Course in Miracles, and could not relate to the talking heads of this DVD. What's worse, I shared it with a friend prior to watching it, which gave her a bad impression of what the Course is about. Some people may relate to it, but it wasn't for me. I found a lot of the monologues bizarre interpretations of the Course, and incoherent at many points. In fairness, I stopped watching after the first DVD. I don't feel that it had anything relevant to offer me. I can only speak from my own perspective. Some students of the Course may completely connect with this material. However, I don't think it is a good intro for people who have not studied the Course in Miracles."
1,Please don't waste your money,"As A Course In Miracles student, I mis-interpreted this as another of the Course's resources. I still don't know what the function is, other than another opportunity to forgive. This DVD contains a lot of rhetoric but no teaching. Don't waste your money!"
3,Source of this material is Endeavour Academy.,"We cannot reasonably doubt the obvious sincerity of those who give the talks.It is sensible (and useful for other purchasers of this dvd) to point out in reviews of this dvd, that the origin of the material is from Endeavour Academy, and this is only one of several important and valuable streams of interpretation of A Course In Miracles.Like many other things, if it provides an entry way to the Workbook of the Course itself, then it has done its job. Take what you need and leave the rest."
5,Beyond words!!,"This is a beautiful docomentary film and I admit to being moved to tears.As a student of A Course in Miracles myself, and also for anyone else studying it, this DVD serves as an inspiring affirmation to the deep effects it is having on people's lives. And for anyone who has not embarked on the miraculous, mind journey the book offers, let this serve as a wonderful introduction and insight into what, with the necessary amount of commitment, you can safely look forward to experiencing.To fellow students, watch, be inspired,and revel in the love in which the film was made. And to potential students, watch, be inspired, and revel in the love and excitement of what A Course in Miracles is offering you.Kurt(kurtwrebel@hotmail.com)"
3,Jesus preaching Quantum Physics?,"This movie was a Howl!As a believer in Born Again Cristianity(some sorts of, not all), and an avid Physics Theory buff,I found this video extremely entertaining. However, in order to mesh the two together, the ""Leader""(of what this is obviously is some sort of ""Cult"")found it necessary to water down both the religiousdoctrine and the physics theory to the point where they both exhibited a gross lack of potency.What kept me interested was the lack of credulity in the presentation, and the amount of chutzpah(sheer nerve) to put this out. It reminded me of the past ""scare tactic"" films of the 1950'sshown to American G.I.'s before going over seas, and safety and health info warnings played in Public Schoolauditoriums, that later became cult classics for their campy value.One important note, I must admit. Nothing that was presented was in and of itself un-true.But the way it was confabulated together I found jaw-dropping!"
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"I have followed David Phelps since he joined the Gaither Vocal Band. I think he has one of the best tenor voices I've ever heard...but you sure wouldn't know it to listen to this CD!!! I have listened to his other solo projects, and I'm always disappointed! David is obviously trying to launch a solo career, but the true beauty of his voice only comes through in a group where he can showcase that tenor voice. Perhaps it's just the choices of songs, but he does not do well as a solo artist.Everyone I have loaned this CD to feels exactly the same way that I do...solo projects are NOT David's calling. He EXCELS in the Gaither Vocal Band, and I really hope he stays there...because I believe his career as a soloist will be VERY short lived!"
5,Outstanding,"David Phelps, you have a God-given talent! This album showcases that talent, especially in the songs ""Virtuoso"" and ""Just as I am"". The message in this album is as strong as his powerful tenor voice. It is most evident in the song ""Arm Open Wide"". Many times I have made the argument that David has the best tenor voice short of heaven. I take this album as proof (just listen to it)! As I said, David has a God-given talent. I am glad that he gives the credit to the right person."
5,Amazing Voice,"This man has the most amazing voice I have ever heard. It simply takes my breath away. He is supposed to be a tenor, and he is, but the range of his voice is just as good with the low to medium notes as with the high notes. My favorite song on this album is ""Just As I Am"". He does a range change that blows me away. I am a fan!"
3,moderately good,"I agree that he has good control and hits all the right notes, but he sounds a bit 'forced', and the selection of songs may be a little too varied for some. A disc like this fits into no genre--definitely not the kind of cd you'd just want to pop in while working. He has a more 'trained' sound than most Christian Contemporary artists, and in this case, it's not necessarily a good thing. When I buy a Christian cd, I want the artist to convince me with their intonation and feeling, as well as talent. Mr. Phelps has talent, but I'm not convinced.Great for those who appreciate a trained voice and a wide variety of genres on the same cd."
3,Out of Gas,"Okay, don't get me wrong, David is by far the best tenor ever in Gospel music. His voice is incredible, and he does not run out of gas, but the album sure does.I know he wants to appeal to a wide variety of people, but if this were vinyl, I would never listen to the B side. Maybe it's the order, maybe it's the fact that the styles are too broad in range, or maybe it's the message of ""God is love"" in these songs. I do believe that He is love, but I also believe he is holy, just, righteous, etc.Personally, I feel that this is the doing of his contract with Word Records. It seems a little politically correct. In order to play on the airwaves, you can't say certain things, you have to have a certain style, blah, blah, blah. I think I feel the most disappointment because it almost seems like a sell out. Oh well, there's always the Vocal Band."
3,OK,"I really enjoy David Phelps when he sings without all the theatrics. He really has a lovely voice. I particularly like his operatic renditions. I purchased 2 of his cd's, and was a little disappointed.This cd was not as good as I had hoped for - some good, some awful"
5,Necessary for Wife,Wife loves this product. Changed out all our switches with no accidents. Necessary for checking for hot wires--works great!
3,Handle broke the first day.,"I like Vaughan products. The hammer came in a reasonable amount of time. However, the grain in the handle ran horizontal to the face, so the handle broke on the first day of use. I had to replace it."
3,Pretty..but is not a must have,"It has pretty pictures and some chatty writing but I would not consider it a must have on the shelf of Vietnamese cooking. Though it is better than alot of Vietnamese cookbooks I have come across.Flaws include:1) Assumption of knowledge of meat preparation including how to clean squid and cutting for tenderness;2) Does not prepare reader fully when recipe is longer than 15 minutes. Yes indeed it will take more than 15, matter of fact, it will approach an hour or so (yipes);3) Some recipes especially stocks are westernized excessively (celery! no star anise);The section on pickles though is good. So are the pictures dealing with ingredients.Get this pupster on a discount not at full retail. It is good as a supplement but it is not a desert island classic."
4,This is one of the best Vietnamese cookbooks available!,"I am buying a copy of this book for my mother, aunts and culinary friends. The pictures are beautiful- of the food and of the country. The recipes are easy to understand and authentic- it reminded me of my mother's cooking... And she is an excellent chef. I highly recommend this book to all who are interested in preparing Vietnamese food."
2,many ingredients are not availale in US,"I bought the cook book from Mrs. Trieu Thi Choi to take home. I found there are so many ingredients called for in her recipes that are not available in US, particularly the one called ""bt khai"" which is used in making steamed buns (Bánh bao) .Also, the recipes use too much Monosodium glutamate."
1,This collection of recipes was sadly unrealistic.,In this collection of recipes I found that the book was poorly manufactured. There were pages that were left blank. I found that out only after I purchased the book. The book flips for one page number to another in no particular oder. The books I browse through each had there own type of defect. Overall the book was made bad but the recipes were very interesting and the pre-history was well written.
3,disappointed,"My sister gave me one of these when I was little. Recently discovered that I lost it and she was upset so I got a replacement from bbtoystore, very disappointed. The hair is falling out more than usual, which i suppose is normal for cheap toys these days, but i don't think it'll take long to be bald. Also, found a cobweb in the fur. good thing this wasn't going to a little kid."
2,"Nice fights, pretty girls, no story or anything to recommend it","Yeah you can't expect much from a movie called Onechanbara Bikini Samurai Squad and you don't get much either.There's zombies, a bikini-wearing swordswoman, a leather-wearing girl with a gun, a fat guy for comic relief and fights with various girls in schoolgirl outfits.No nudity, not much gore, no real story, nothing too impressive as far as special effects or makeup.To tell the truth I was just bored.If you're looking for cheap gore or nudity I'd recommendAttack Girls Swim Team vs The Undeadover this. Onechanbara is just a middle of the road low-budget Japanese film."
4,Cover doesn't lie,"I did not play the game, but was familiar with the idea.If the movie had shown the lead in her bikini more I think it would have been more true to form. Still in the end it was a fun zombie romp, and I can't complain too much."
5,It should be illegal to be this good,"There simply is no other disc like this out there. Fast, furious, tight, loud... amazing songwriting with an incredible delivery. It is a far cry from the teenpop punk and nu-metal movements. Anyone who thinks bands like Good Charlotte ""rock"", I would have to insist that they pick this CD up and prepare for a solid ass kicking. It opens with an explosion and doesn't let up for 40 minutes. Standouts for me include Bone China and Petal, but every track holds its own. Its such a relief that there is finally some decent rock music hitting the scene again. I hope that anyone who cares about what the music they listen to sounds like will find this CD and enjoy it at least half as much as I do."
3,Another theory,"If you are one who is interested in theories instead of applied research/information, this book is for you. Baron-Cohen is 'way out there' with this theory using a psychological approach."
5,A Real Gem!,"Like a lot of the other people who got this CD, I have loved Device's one AT40 hit ""Hanging on a Heart Attack"" since I heard it in 1985 (or 86?). I'm from New Zealand andnobody knows the band there, let alone in their native USA. In the 90s, I found the track on a ""Living in Oblivion"" 80s compilation and fell in love with it again. Then in 2005 I foundthe CD on Amazon. It remains in heavy rote on my I-pod. Nearly every song on this album is a winner. Apart from the title track, my faves. are ""Who Said"" (which was also a single--there is a video for this one, check out You Tube), ""When Love is Good"", ""Who's on the Line"" and ""Sand, Stone, Cobwebs and Dust"". Amazing that all the members of this band had various successes with other projects (esp. the amazing song writing of Holly Knight), yet they barely caused a ripple with Device. However, it seems there a lot of other people who loved ""Hanging on a Heart Attack"" enough to hunt down this CD!"
5,Flat out jammin!,"One of my favs from the 80's. Lost the cassette years ago but never forgot the name of the album cuz it was so easy to remember. I mean how can someone forget these great tunes.I'm so glad Amazon has it, now I can enjoy the whole album instead of just the one hit that put them on the map."
5,A real 80's band!,"If you are truly an 80's nut, then you would surely have remembered ""DEVICE"" Holly Knight and her crew had the 80's in their lyrics and look. Lead singer Paul Engemann had a voice that could handle knights' lyrical demands, and Gene Black does a great job on the guitar. I, like most 80's folk, had the cassette 'thing' goin on and had my ""22B3"" tape stolen from my car. It was then that I realized that I would never see it again. It was no longer being produced. Thanks for helping me find a classic! NB Seattle, Wa"
3,Re-released at last....but no bonus tracks???,"Marred by 80s overproduction (this sounds like the soundtrack to an Iron Eagle film or something), this one release by the band Device does not live up to the strength of songs band member Holly Knight wrote for other artists in the 80s, nor does it come close to showing off the talents of Mike Chapman, a producer who basically pioneered the 'new wave' movement with his production for Blondie, Pat Benatar, and others. The only memorable song on here is the single ""Hangin' on a Heart Attack."" What could have made this disc worth the purchase was if it had included the 12"" versions of the 2 singles ""hangin' on a heart attack"" and ""who says."" I don't know why the label didn't take this one opportunity to make this a complete release."
5,"I CAN'T FIND ANOTHER LIKE THIS... SAD,SAD. CAN ANYBODY HELP?",Unbelievably great since I heard them back in 1986... Electrifying rhythm and breathtaking words... Still one of my favorites.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,This is not the Gaplant Hrairoo from Advance of Zeta as pictured above. This the regular ORX-005 Gaplant. I just got it in the mail and am sorely disappointed. I guess it never hurts to know your Gendums.
2,A heavy reliance on secondary sources.,"When I bought this book I had high expections. The cover photograph is awesome! The book however, turned out to be a disapointment. In terms of research, it's similar to an undergraduate paper. Williams uses very few primary sources, relying instead on the work of others. It's kind of a cut and past job. An examination of the citations will confirm this.I was especially looking forward to a discussion of what many consider Adenauer's finest hour. His decision, despite intense opposition, to push for reparations for Jewish victims of the Holocaust. Williams barely mentions the reparations and dosn't even attempt to examine Adenaurer's motivations.In terms of of giving an overview of Adenauer's life the book's ok. But this giant of the 20th Century deserves better."
3,Thoughtful biography on one of Germany's great leaders,"This book is the biography of the great Konrad Adenauer, the long serving German Kanzeller charged with rebuilding a shattered Germany following WW2. His childhood, education, and involvement in the Köln government are all described in detail. He is shown in an honest light and at times comes across as egotistical, greedy, and unfaithful. But he was also very determined, highly competent, and utterly committed to seeing Germany reunited under a peaceful, democratic government.Overall, the book is a worthwhile read but tended to be a bit dry and sometimes got bogged down in detail. The complex issues facing him after the war and how he dealt with them are really the most important parts of this book and I would have liked to have seen this covered in a bit more detail. For those looking for an informative and comprehensive history of Herr Adenauer, this should do."
5,dewalt right angle,"This is a recon drill, it actually came with a couple of smudges on it. I bought recons before and they were very clean. I didn't see scratches or signs of use/abuse just the smudges.It came with 2 batteries, they are not the EXP batteries, just plain 18v, I didn't know they made them. I checked the desc and there is no claim they are EXP.Overall the drill works perfect...I put a few of my own scratches and smudges on it, it's a tool it gets used. The batteries are OK, the EXP holps a charge much longer, but these work.It's a good value, I would recomend it and dealling with tool king was easy and would deal with them again and buy dewalt recons again"
4,What you want.,Great tool. More than adequate torque and long battery life. Just wish the forward reverse button was a little easier to access.
4,LIKE THE OLD DAYS,"I bought this cd because i am a completly fan of Alan Parsons. This cd has his essence. The songs are 80's rock and the mostly are balads but with the rhythm of song of alan parsons who is the producer of the cd. The singers in keats were singers in the cds of alan parsons and they sang songs like pyramania, you don't belive or winding me up"
2,Too commercialized,"I like both Camel, Alan Parsons Project and some of Colin Blunstone's albums, but this sounds too much like guys trying to write a pop hit even if they are slightly out of touch with current music. The same thing happened to Camel when they tried to please the record company with The Single Factor (the title gives more than a hint).If you like the slower, more textured or more adventurous stuff you'll find very little here. I hear a bunch of guys trying to sound like a band, but lacking real chemistry.Having said that, these guys are too good to make an album without some strong moments. But there is a reason this album doesn't get mentioned more - neither by the musicians nor their fans."
2,This was not a big help for me...,"This was not a big help as this is more for the big money makers of Ebay, but it doesn't help the little guys out like myself trying to make it big. They need to down scale it - come down to earth with it. Maybe more people will be drawn to it and will buy it."
2,See below to see a better book and save you time and money....,How to Start and Run an eBay Consignment Businessby Skip McGrath
1,Why Bother?,"The 2nd Edition of Fowler is currently in print from Oxford University Press. There is, therefore, no possible reason for anyone to buy this travesty. The 3rd edition filled me with a desire to seize a red pencil and re-edit it; as a reference book it is useless."
2,Not what the doctor ordered,"Frankly I think this 3rd edition should be pulped. The 2nd edition was authoritative and prescriptive. If I want to hear or read how people speak now, I only need to refer to my graduate students. I don't think we need a book that validates the continuing decline of the language."
1,Keep your Gowers -- save your $30,"The impression I have from my bookstore sampling is consistent with the several reviews I see here -- that the ""Burchfield"" Fowlers is not an improvement over the Gowers. I came so close to spending the $30 anyway just to be sure that I and my now-high schooler would have the latest and therefore (arguably) best usage manual on our shelf. Thanks, folks, for helping me recognize more clearly what my initial instinct was struggling to tell me. It ain't worth it -- stay with Gowers."
1,"an insult - to readers, to Fowler, to wit, to intelligence","The book is not wrong - it is, quite simply, boring. You CAN use it as a reference, but why would you want to? The original (2nd ed.) is still available and is still infintely more fun. I suspect the original will remain the authority and this will be a passing curiosity."
1,nothing to do with Fowler and worthless,"Ernest Gower, as editor of the second edition of Henry Fowler's ""Modern English Usage"" (""The New Fowler's Modern English"" is being marketed as the third), made modest stylistically and logically consistent changes in order to honestly update the original. ""The New Fowler's Modern English"" in contrast rewrites it completely and makes a particular point of demonstrating its contempt for Henry Fowler--yet uses Fowler's name as a selling point. Be that as it may, this, ""The New Fowler's Modern English"", is bloated, tedious, clumsily written, and deadly dull--constantly belaboring the obvious. It's hard to imagine a native speaker of English finding any use for it at all."
3,"Honestly, it isn't a bad book... it's just not Fowler's","I think that the issue most people have with the third edition of this book is the big word ""Fowler's"" on the cover. If it had simply been called ""Modern English Usage,"" this book would, I think, be a very useful tool to most literary folk.The second edition of Fowler's had charisma and wit on it's side. This book, the third is well... it is a good tool, and not much more.Personally, I use both editions in different ways. When I was in school once sat down and read the second edition cover to cover, and I still, occasionally consult it. Because the third edition deals with Canadian English (and I suppose American too) I use it, infrequently, like I would a regular dictionary."
5,A good digital clock,"I have three of these little clocks and I really like them. I like not having the display lit up at night, which another reviewing complained about. They do not always arrive with the perfect time, but the instructions are fairly easy to follow to correct that problem. They do automatically correct for Daylight Savings Time. They have been very reliable and the temperature readings have been accurate as far as I can tell."
1,Do not waste your money,"Hi i bought the alarm clock online and when i received it i realized that first at night if you want ot see the time and you press the snooz button the clock will show the alarm time and you have to press it again to see the time and at nights this gets very anoyying. Second the alarm sound is very low beeps with pauses that can hardly be heard, my advice do not even waste one dollar on this alarm clock.Thank You"
3,Nice size for travel,The clock is a perfect size for travel. The alarm is easy to set and produces a sound that awakens without jarring. It's hard to read however and would be more efficient if it could light up at night.
1,Junk,"This piece of junk was 5 mins slow when I first switched it on, and the thermometer was out by about 10C. I thought new batteries might fix it, and all it did was reset it to 12:00 Jan 1 2008. With no way to tell it the right date and time it is effectively a pile of junk that isn't even a good paperweight.Avoid."
5,It's PEANUTS...what can you say? IT's fabulous!,Love The Peanuts gang. I purchased this for my 6 year old grandson who plays baseball and he'd never seen Charlie Brown before. He loved the dvd and I was thrilled to introduce him to something so wholesome and entertaining!
3,Ok,"I am still looking for that perfect reference book. I guess there is no such thing in any computer related subject. They either skim over an area or avoid it all together. This is another one of those. Granted its only 225 pages, and is quite helpful to those that are beginners. I want a book I can grow with not a beginner book."
2,Not for me.....,"I thought this book would assume more knowledge of the user being that it says it's for web professionals. I thought it might get into database stuff and etc, but it didn't. I knew it would start very basic but was hoping it would delve deeper. It maintains anlevel that is rather basic. I would only recomend this book to someone who is new to flash."
4,Conquering the Curve,"Some learning curves are so high that it takes a TON of concentrated effort to become proficient. I bought this book a year ago and it was a GREAT starting point.I know consider myself an expert, having read and absorbed the whole Flash 5 Bible, and more...but I never would have understood the BIBLE had I not worked through this book. It's one of those things that WHILE you're learning...you don't understand, but then afterwards...you're like OH! I GOT IT!It's a pretty neat book. The only thing I don't like about it is that there is no cd...the files had to be downloaded, which was a pain as I learned Flash on my laptop...but still...DEFINATELY A GOOD BOOK TO GET YOU STARTED"
1,cheap material,"this costume was not made for an adult if so the adult would have to be under 100lb and about 4' tall. My husband is 5'5"" and 140lb's and he had to wear it open in the back. the material is so cheap that it fell apart taking it out of the package."
1,one-size does NOT fit all,"I should have listened to the first reviewer who said the costume didn't fit her husband who is 5'6 - she said it wouldn't close in back. I figured it would work for my husband b/c he is very skinny. I am 5'3 and I tried it on - I can't even completely raise my arms in the jumpsuit! I bought this for my 6'0 husband - I don't know what adult man would fit into this....don't bother buying it, especially because now I can't even return it (funshippedfast doesn't take returns, which I didn't realize!)"
1,Tin Man Costume,"I was very disappointed with the sizing of this costume. It was to be for an adult male, one size fits all. It was more on the size of a child. I ended up making the costume over, using it as a pattern. If I were a man, I would be considered to be small."
1,SO small!!!!,"Bought this costume for my fiancé, who is about 5’11” and maybe 180lbs. When he tried this costume on, it wasn’t even close to fitting. Are you kidding me??? It’s seems to be made for a child. I couldn’t believe it! Plus, the material is super thin and cheap. Don’t buy this costume for an adult male, unless they are short and VERY skinny. I would probably give this 0 stars, if I could. The only plus was the hat that came with it, which we ended up using. And don't be fooled, the axe and heart are NOT included."
2,tin man outfit,"Delivery was fast and the item was in great shape! Thanks for the prompt service! Too bad the heart, axe and gloves don't come with the outfit! Oh well! Thanks again!"
3,"Great, but the Blue one is worth the extra $","This is a good hammer, but the magnetic nail starter on the blue version is worth the extra money. The magnetic nail holder on the blue one allows you to start a nail as high over head as you can reach with the hammer - for those times that you can't use both hands to start the nail."
1,girl hammer,This hammer feels good. I usually am framing with a 21 oz. I thought a couple oz. wouldn't matter.. but it does. This hammer just bounces off the nails. This hammer is for the ladies.
2,"Good look, too small, cheap metal","This piece defiantly appears to be either silver plated or possibly just painted, defiantly not pure, but if that doesn't bother you... It's a fine piece."
2,"Some fine soul, but lousy remastering","Those who, like myself, bought this CD for its famous title track will be disappointed on finding out that it, as well as a number of other tracks on this CD, is severely marred by an ugly, high-pitched chirping noise. As this noise pops up on tracks from more than one recording session, I suspect it is a result of faulty remastering. While this CD contains some really good southern soul, I can't really recommend a shoddy product. Hopefully, this material will show up in a better package in the future."
4,Moominpappa at Sea,A passionate deconstruction of Scandinavia patriarchy in which a coming-of-age story embodies in renewed spiritual awareness of the inter-relatedness of all elements of the ecosystem.
5,Exquisite,"Jansson is one of the only authors I've ever read, for either child or adult, who can so deftly put her fingers on life as we experience it - the mood shifts, the disappointments and inner worlds and longings, the quirks and kindnesses, the tangible atmosphere of the seasons and the weather and the seaside... by God, she's got it, and with a few flicks of the pen, she can realize them fully and make us feel them too (even when her protagonists are fictional, round little ""Moomintrolls"" off for a month on a mysterious windswept lighthouse island.) Astonishing. A book to read and reread by anyone in grade 4 and up, especially in August and September (though anytime will do.)"
1,SO SAD TO HEAR,"AS A DEVOTED FAN FOR THE LAST 40 YRS,I WAITED IN PAIN FOR THE LATEST B.BARE DISC,BUT SORRY TO SAY,I DID PUT IT AWAY AFTER LISTENING A COUPLE OF TIMES.THE ONES THAT PICKED THE SONGS MUST HAVE BEEN OUT OF THEIR MINDS.IS IT BB JR?IF SO,PLEASE KEEP THE DISTANCE FROM THE OLD COWBOY.SORRY TO SAY,ITS ATRAGEDY.NILS ROLAND NORWAY"
2,Bare Jr.'s Revenge,"Some have likened this ""comeback"" disc to Johnny Cash's later material on American Recordings, but there's a major difference:Rick Rubin, the producer of the American records ""got"" Johnny Cash. He understood his image, his past recordings and he played to Cash's strengths as the brooding, powerful stoic and added to his legacy.Bobby Bare Jr.--who produced this stuff--doesn't seem to understand his father at all. This simply does not sound like a Bobby Bare record. There's no connection to the Bare persona--the laconic, hell-raising raconteur-- developed over some three decades of recording. This sounds like someone was producing a Jack Jones record and at the last minute Jones pulled out and Bare filled in for him.It seems as if Bare Jr. is playing some sort of joke on his father and the listeners. Maybe he's getting back at him for that awful ""Daddy, What If"" recording from 30 years ago."
3,Bobby Bare is Back,"I was thrilled to hear of the return of Bobby Bare to the recording studio, as he was a favorite of ours for years. However, I found this album disappointing. Not in Bobby Bare; his voice is still as smooth and amazingly mellow as always. Instead, the choice of songs seems totally haphazard and unsuited to him. I guess I was expecting to hear from this great old cowboy who has had a long a wonderful career and now looks back with a few regrets and scars, but ""rode that pony well."""
3,"Good for keeping out dust, but....","This item is a dust magnet itself. After purchasing one (it arrived three days ago), i slipped it onto my Ipod, and started listening to music. But now, my ipod is covered in a dusty film. If you also live in a dusty climate (I live in So. Cal.), you may be better off with a cover which can be wiped down with a sponge.Overall, I think the product is good, but under dusty conditions, there is better to be had."
5,An outstanding piece of work,"Having been born in Holmes County, Ohio, I can say without reservation that Murphy's book is the very best of the many I have read about the Amish and Mennonites. Her research is meticulous and she delivers a very captivating, exciting, and believable adventure of one family that makes this historical novel a superb read. It's easy to see why it was one of the prestigious 2003 Ohio Book Fair selections."
3,Filmography Disappointing,"Although this is a wonderfully performed ballet and set beautifully, I am highly disappointed that the camera person missed critical footwork on more occasions than I would have expected by being zoomed in too closely on the characters themselves. If you are as I am, I critique the footwork of ballet as that is where my eye is focused, especially when the ballerina is on point. This ballet rendition left me in anguish time and again over this fatal filmographic flaw and therefore I am found lacking in being satisfied by this performance."
5,Beautiful and Fantastic!,"This is one of the best ballet ive seen,Pugni's musical score is truly magnificent! And im very happy to know that Zakharova, Alexandrova and Filin are group together in this wonderful and spectacular production!"
4,The Game of Warehouse 13,"WE, my family love this show, I started to watch it and then I got the rest of my family doing the same.I noticed same place that this show had five seasons? Are you going to show all of them on TV etc?I like the show because it covers history and the effects the item has on the pass, and future.The crew is believable and good fun as well."
2,"Hey, Warehouse 13! Stop this slide toward the stupidity!","What has happened to Warehouse 13? This used to be a fun show, but now it's getting annoying. Don't get me wrong -- I loved the slide toward a darker storyline; the exploration of the murky gray line of morality and mortality. But Pete's and Myka's characters have become a joke. They're less believable than the Three Stooges.Pete's ""finger-snapping"" and ""talk-to-the-hand"" sass has got to stop! Now! And the geisha undercover opening was insulting -- not only to the Japanese, but to ANYONE WITH HALF A BRAIN.This is possibly the worst episode of the whole series."
5,Loved it!,"These episodes were great! The writers keep you coming back for more! Great plots, great acting, suspenseful, need I say more.."
5,Amazing!,"This is a 5 star show. As you watch Warehouse 13 you will begin to care about the characters. You will care if they survive and thrive. The unique qualities about Micha, Artie, Pete, Jinx, and Claudia become plot twists that define them in a way that leaves you really wondering, is it all going to be okay. Season 4 is no exception to this rule!"
5,"Creative, funny, suspenseful, well-acted. Love this show. Come back for a 5th season!","I love Warehouse 13. I hope it comes back for a fifth season. The show is well written, acted and humorous. I'm glad I bought all the DVDs. It's hard to find good scifi these days. Everything is about vampires. This show takes common objects and gives them extraordinary powers with an evil twist."
4,Warehouse 13 season 4,"We watched all the available Warehouse 13 shows on Netflix, but the new shows are not available there. We have become Warehouse 13 devotees. The show has lovable characters, just the right mix of suspense and foreshadowing, along with a ripe dose of humor. Not willing to wait for Netfilx we gladly fork up two bucks to see each show the week it is available on here at Amazon."
5,Awesome,"I have really gotten into this series. Amazon instant video was really easy to use an thanks to the credit they gave me for purchasing a different item, it was free."
4,"Meh, but the show is good!","The only thing I don't like about buying this streaming media is that I don't actually own the product.Warehouse 13 itself though, is completely awesome. Great show! Claudia and Pete are my faves."
5,Couldn't stop watching,I watched this whole season in a few days. Enjoyed every minute of it. Can't wait for the next season!
5,Awesome!,"Just the right combo of syfy, humor, mystery, and action. This is a very fun and addictive show. I highly recommend this for adult Harry Potter fans and X-Files fans."
5,Outstanding!!,Warehouse 13 does it again. Love the series! Keep up the great writing and casting. I'll be sure to purchase the entire series.
2,Great show but late episodes,"This season like all the rest is just great. Only problem is that Amazon is late when it comes to making episodes available. This is often true with SyFy shows, that we have to wait two or more days. Fortunately, they can be found elsewhee."
1,Fantastic Show - Episodes arrive late,"This is one TV series that really benefits from HD. The show is great but unfortunately, Amazon is often slow in providing the latest episode. One might need to wait two or more days for an episode to be made available."
5,Love Warehouse 13,I started watching this show on Netflix and have been hooked and it just keeps getting better and better. Love it!
4,I love this show!,Every show is a new surprise. I really enjoy learning about the different objects. I always try to guess who had the artifact before they tell you. Its really interesting finding out the origins of things!
4,Great start to the 4th Season,"Warehouse 13 is a SciFi fans dream(nightmare) show.The fourth season continues the story from the season 3 cliff hanger,but still maintains the quirky weirdness of the first 3 seasons."
3,Not so good,"I have watched this show since it came on the air 4 years ago.this season is nowhere as good as the first 3.The ratings for the show are pretty bad on nielson. So I doubt that it will get a pickup for another season.I really hope that the show does not end in a cliff hanger this season because I am really having my doubts about if it will get a 5th and final season.I also do not like the character Steve. I think he is pretty boring and he does not bring much to the show. I guess they needed a love interest for Claudia. I also dont like what they have done to Claudia's character this season.I liked her much better as the punk rock rebel type she was portraying !Now they are trying to make her out to be more ""grown up"" ."
5,Awesome,I like science fiction shows and the fact that I can watch it whenever it's convenient for me is great! I love amazon!!!
5,Warehouse 13 Season 4 Cliffhanger Ending,"Warehouse 13 writers really know how to leave one biting one's nails until the next season begins. This one is particularly poignant, and as with all the cliffhangers gives hints as to the possible resolution in Season 5. As usual, I can hardly contain myself waiting to see if I guessed correctly. Shout out to Mrs. Fredrick: you go girl!"
1,There better be three more episodes coming....,"So far only 10 episodes in Season 4. A typical season is 13 regular episodes. Hulu has Episode 10 as does Amazon.If they expect people to shell out $50 for a 10-episode season, SyFy needs its head examined.Steve has potential, but why SyFy made him a ""gay"" character (Pete often acts more gay than Steve does) seems to indicate that SyFy is being politically correct...make a character just for the sake of ""diversity"" and not because it's relevant to the story arc.I'm not bothered much by Claudia's maturity. It was hinted she is up to be the next ""caretaker"" of Warehouse 13...indicating that caretakers might live long, but eventually pass away.I'd change this review to more than one star if SyFy puts out more episodes for this season, but if it's over at 10, I don't think it deserves extra stars for shorting the fans."
3,Immediately Frustrated,"I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning. First, the battery box is very poorly designed. Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again. The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open. Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out!My second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad. The sounds quality is poor and it doesn't always sound like a dog."
2,Very Disappointed,"Although the cold nose puppies are cute and cuddly, and my children love playing with them, I am still very disappointed and would not buy this toy again because as mentioned in other reviews, the battery packs WILL NOT stay inside the toy. The velcro will not stay fastened. I am tempted to sew this toy together, but that would create another problem when it's time to replace the batteries. I cannot believe that a manufacturer would design such a poor battery compartment. For the amount of money the toy cost, I expected it to be designed much better."
5,So happy with our choice!,"This little puppy was our solution to our 2yr old's request for a puppy for Christmas. It is such a sweet little thing that I even find myself playing with it. She's a little younger than they recommend, but has no problems getting him to do all his tricks. ""Abbie"" sleeps at the end of her bed every night. We've had no problem getting the battery pack to stay in - just have to keep the fur out of the velcro. Our family was so impressed by how real it looks and sounds, yet it's not annoying thanks to the fact it turns off after you leave it alone for a bit. I love that it doesn't have stiff robot legs so it is still cuddly and not too heavy. I really can't think of a better alternative to the real thing."
2,poorly designed,"I felt compelled to write because one reason I bought this was that I'd read several good reviews. We have this Yorkshire Terrier version of this toy, and I regret the purchase very much. The reviewer who mentioned the battery box issue nailed it - it's pretty much impossible to keep the velcro closed because the dog's hair is all stuck in the hooks, and the battery box is too large and heavy and doesn't want to stay in the too-small compartment. It's pretty cute, but you don't see its eyes AT ALL - they show in the photo, but I don't know what you'd have to do to it to make it look like that. I will say my daughter doesn't want to get rid of it (not that she plays with it all that much) but I always want to because every time I try to stick the battery pack inside I'm pretty sure my blood pressure goes up.Maybe a different version of the toy without long hair would be okay."
4,gritty tale of urban terror,"one of mr carpenters earlier works and probably his purest.no special effects,no unstoppable maniac,no bimbo screaming and running.just an assault on precinct 13.a lone sheriff goes to close an old precinct and transfer belongings to new one goes awry.when a man who has met up with unexpected violence happens to enter precinct 13,hell follows him.i will offer no other plot lines.but im sure when you get this movie,you will be thrilled.i have a couple of questions though.WHY IS THIS SO EXPENSIVE AND WHY ARE SO MANY OTHER DVD TRANSFERABLE MOVIES NOT AVAILABLE ON DVD(the vampires kiss,3 oclock high,wierd science,after hours,eracerhead,dead and buried,just to name a few)."
3,Classic John Carpenter,"Originally filmed in 1976, this movie follows a fairly common theme of that era. Criminals on a rampage.They mayhem starts with the assasination of a group of gang members by police. This is followed by the sensless killing of a young girl and her father's attempt to strike back at the gremlins. He stumbles into an abandoned police station that is occupied by a handfull of cops and some convicts on their way to Death Row. Everyone must join forces and defend themselves against the assault that follows.Since 99% of the movie takes place after dark, it is very difficult to pick out details in the scenes. A noticeable error was the weapon used by one of the prisoners against the gang members. He is given a silenced handgun that he uses during the assault. Note to the technical staff...a suppressor (silencer) doesn't work on a revolver."
5,ASSAULT AND BATTERY EQUALS ENTERTAINMENT,"Imagine a abondened police station, with only a few oxxupants, and little ammunition, taking on a youth gang. It's an explosive, edge of your seat horror movie, a guarenteed good time for all."
3,"Good, but....","Sometime ago, I bought this film thinking it was the special edition. (It even had the same cover as this one.) However, I soon found out that it was fairly bare boned, save for a commentary (which was actually recorded from the laserdisc edition) and the theatrical trailer. In short, I was dissapointed.I recently found this version in a store and bought it. There is definitely more stuff in it, including info about the film and an interview with John Carpenter and Austin Stoker. However, I do have one complaint. The commentary is the same one from the other DVD. I thought Carpenter had recorded a new commentary. Guess not. I indeed prefer this version to the other one I previously bought, but the lack of a new commentary cheeses me off.As for the film itself, I highly recommend it. Defininetly one of Carpenter's best. I suggest you buy this movie, even if all you can find it on is VHS. It's worth it."
2,About average for Carpenter,"ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976) Directed, written, scored and edited byJohn Carpenter.Starring Austin Stoker, Charles Cyphers, Nancy Loomis and HenryBrandon.An early crime film by Carpenter about a Los Angeles police stationabout to close down and with a skeleton crew that finds itself undersiege by a large(and unlikely interracial) street gang with high poweredweapons. Not brilliant. Flawed in that way nearly all of Carpenter'sfilm are. Vaguely wince inducing dialogue. Still. An entertainingcrime film and an inoffensive time killer.And yes THAT Henry Brandon who played Barnaby in BABES IN TOYLAND andFu Manchu in DRUMS OF FU MANCHU!!!This was apparently remade recently!! I imagine with CGI gangmembers??"
3,From the Director of HALLOWEEN!!!,"This is the original Assault on Precinct 13! It's very different from the remake! The action and violence is pretty cool! It seemed like a classic videogame whenever the cops were shooting the bad guys through the windows. It sucked that the little girl died, all she wanted was ice cream. I think John Carpenter did a great job at directing this! If you love classic action, you'll love ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13!!!"
3,Very Good,Just watched this for the first time since the late 70's. I must say the movie still holds up. It is a low budget flick but it is done really well and for what it is it is pretty damn good and entertaining still. And I must say it beats out the slick hollywood remake by a mile.
4,GOTTA SMOKE?,"One of Carpenter's earliest films 'Assault on Precinct 13' is an early attempt of a future going crazy story like 'Mad Max' or 'Escape From New York.' Set in the not so distant future, (the film was made in '76) all the gangs of L.A. have united into a huge organization and stolen a large supply of weapons. With the police on red alert, a soon to be shut down station comes under siege and a single cop, some death row prisoners, and a secretary are forced to defend the building from seemingly countless gangsters. The plot is paper thin, but fast paced, gun toting action and an intense score by Carpenter compensate well. Casting was done well though I only found one character (Wilson) truely relatable. But 'Assault on Precinct 13' is a story meant to be just enjoyed, not intensively dwelt on. So if your looking for a good time without having to strain your brain, this flick is definitely worth a check."
5,True John Carpenter,"Lesser known Carpenter (at least to most modern-day filmgoers) that begins with its eerie, awesome Carpenter-composed music and moves to a movie that keeps you glued to the screen. It's been said in many reviews that this is Carpenter's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD-style flick, and it does resemble it. The good guys have triggered something in the bad that triggers them to take revenge. Simple plot, but with Carpenter, ANYTHING is worth watching."
5,Believe the Blu-Ray Hype,"This Blu-Ray edition trumps all other editions of tihs film on DVD. The image is wonderfully sharp and impressively clean. It kills the Blu-Ray edition of Carpenter's Halloween. Textures and facial features are crystal clear. The HD soundtrack sound as good as it probably ever wlil. Same supplements as the previous standard edition DVD. If you own a Blu-Ray player and like John Carpenter films, then this (and The Thing) are the places to start building your Carpenter collection."
4,Great Film,This is the original assault on preciinct 13. I saw the remake which wasn't bad but this is the original. Many movies were immitated from this gang film genre. This is the best one even better than the remake. I would check the remake as well so you'll have a refrence to see how movies were made for entertainment without all the special effects and mindless shootem ups of today.
5,A major face lift for A John Carpenter classic!,"By far one of the best remasterings i've seen in a long time. If your a longtime fan of this flick and dont think the film could get any better, well then think again!! (enough said)"
3,good old movie,"It was a good movie, pretty fast going , but , the acting was awful...they just were there , killing one guy after another, and you don't feel like you get to really know anybody, so you can't feel any joy when it is over.You know, when the hero is safe and the movie is over.This is how i feel , i am sure there are others out there that feel differant , but this is my review at how i felt."
4,Classic that SHINES on Blu-ray,"I won't burden you with a full-length review of the film, or the rise and fall of the gang ""Street Thunder"". I will say that this is easily the best presentation of Carpenter's classic yet. With the exception of a few very grainy, barely-improved scenes, the film film is absolutely crystal clear, and surely looks better than it did in the theater. Most notable flaws is the opening scene, and a couple inside the Anderson precinct that look so lousy, they look out of place compared to the quality of the rest of the film.It also includes an old (but great) Carpenter commentary, an old Q&A; with JC and Austin Stoker, and an isolated track for Carpenter's excellent, creepy score. I can't give this five stars because the picture isn't perfect in a few spots. But overall, it's great, and if you're a fan, do not hesitate to pic up this 70s gem."
3,Experts Vs. the Sicilian,"Certainly an in depth book on the sicilian, but the commentary is sparse in spots and leaves the reader to draw his or her's own conclusion far too often. Also as with any popular theoretical opening, keeping current with a book in today's internet world is difficult at best."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CD,"This is an awesome album. Sadly, I have the same problem as others have reported, the audio plays out of only 1 channel. Completely atrocious that the label would press a bunch of faulty CDs and continue to sell them after people have reported problems."
1,"Rating for sound quality, not the album itself","This is a great album.However, I had the same problem as another reviewer. The disc I received had very poor sound quality-- you could only hear music from one side of the headphones or from one speaker no matter what listening device was used."
1,Not in Stereo,"I, as others had the same problem with my disc here. Sound is only coming out of the left channel. It's un-listen-able. I too returned my disc only to find the same issue with my replacement. It's a shame, cause it seems like a great album, just don't buy it from here."
5,CLASSIC ALBUM,Classic cd. You must cop this but be warned the cd has audio problems. You can only hear it out of one speaker. I am not sure what is going on. I bought my copy at Virgin in Times Square.
5,How,"How can Mc's like Pharoahe Monch and Prince Po be slept on? This CD may sound a litte dated to those that have heard Pharoahe's most recent material, but if you can't get enough of his delivery and lyrics, like me, this CD is where you can truly appreciate it. Don't just buy this album, get Stress too as well as the Equinox even though it is getting as pricey as Internal Affairs though both are worth it."
5,BACK TO BASICS,"I like this album but to me it's a little to ""polictical"" their skillz get covered up in the ""message"". IT'S ALRIGHT."
1,Sound Konfusion,"The first copy of the CD I received had poor sound quality and the music did not work on both sides of my speakers in my car, my computer and my home stereo. I returned it thinking that I just received a bad CD, but when I got the replacement from Amazon it had to same sound issues. Too bad because the content is good but the sound is terrible. Do not buy this CD."
4,Very good suit for the money,Wanted a white suit to wear occasionally and am very happy with my purchase. Very nice product for the price but do remember you get what you pay for. Light weight suit but seems to be good material and should last for what I paid.
2,the best way to waste three weeks,"I read this book for a book report and I originally thought it sounded very interesting. I saw the book (it is MASSIVE, 886 pages) and I decided that I still wanted to read it. I began to read and it starts off very confusing and rocky.The book is not funny, and not witty, it just has a smart theme. By the end you are pretty well caught up on characters, plot, etc. but it is grossly sad in a realistic kind of way and a big fat waste of time. If you are a scholar or interested in long books or origin/closer look of the behavioral sciences then this might be something you are interested but if you are on the fence about this book, my advice is get out of it while you still can!!!"
3,Teflon vs. Silicone Fumigation,"Yeah, I'm going to agree with the other reviewer that the first time I used these I almost sent them back because they smelled so strange! The whole house reeked of a sweet-chemically smell. The main reason I bought these was to get away from the chemicals in the Teflex sheets (Teflon is shady at best), but I wondered if I did the right thing after smelling that smell. I did wash the sheets a couple times in soap and water and rubbed them down with a towel. After a few batches of fruit leather and flax crackers, I don't notice the smell any more. (Or maybe I'm just used to it?)Also, I don't know how the Teflex sheets compare, but you definitely have to make sure that whatever you're drying is almost completely dry before it will peel off. Otherwise the mixture sticks to it."
1,paraflexx ultra mats,"I generally do not write reviews, but I must say that I would not buy these again. They have such an offensive odor it is bound to be releasing something chemically. I washed them with soap and water, dried them and they are still repulsive. There is no way my family is eating anything dried on these. I would have appreciated if it had said on the website that they have an odor."
5,worked great!,I did not have any smell on the sheets I received. I made banana crepes and after they were dehydrated they peeled off fine. I definitely would purchase the dehydrate and paraflexx sheets again.
2,Hope's review on Representing Super Doll,"This book seemed so Lame whiLe I was reading it! I don't think it's worth the time if you're not into beauty pageants and stuff Like that. I mean, wow(!):( she wins the Miss Hybrid Seed Corn.....Good for her! I mean, it didnt even have a good cLimax, Let aLone pLot, diaLogue, etc. etc. I think that if you're going to read this book, you'LL have to be into the subject: Beauty contests/Miss America/trying to be how society wants you to be, and not what you wanna be. ALthough, it does have a good message....I guess."
3,"Nice book, but not great","For understanding data mining the book is fine. However, application for CRM is not clear enough."
4,Tiger With Wings,"Wonderfully illustrated and well written, Tiger With Wings is an excellent introduction for children to the great horned owl and owls in general. The book runs about twenty pages and discusses all aspects of the great horned owl's lifecycle in an appropriate manner."
1,You'll be Sorreeeee!!!!!!!,"About 50% Aviation Video. They've got this pseudo Army Guy who can't even keep his ribbons on straight and half the tapes are of him reading something from a cue card. Most of the aviation footage isn't even from the wars but taken at airshows of restored planes. If you buy this video like I did, you'll feel as though you got ripped off. It's put out by ""Columbia River Entertainment Group"". They are on my avoid at all costs list now."
4,"Lacks some of the brilliance of their two previous albums, but still has it's share of great songs","After the release of their 1978 album, Illusion were denied a record deal, which is the reason why this album was not released until 1990, even though most of the songs were recorded in 1979. The lineup is the same (including Jane Relf), though Relf's presence is somewhat less prominent here. Some songs of note are the hummable, nicely crafted ""Walking Space"" and the brilliant hard-driving-guitar cover of the American standard ""Slaughter On 10th Avenue"" which might just be the best ever treatment of that oft-recorded song."
3,Not bad....for a Christian band,"Although the God I pray to is a can of dolphin-safe tuna, this is the one Christian CD I really get into. MY personal favorite tunes are ""First Love"" and ""(Waiting For) A Love That's Real"". They haven't reached this quality since."
3,"After sorting through a little waste, some true gems appear","Believe me, I KNOW it's easy to dismiss this band as a cheesy '80s hair-band. Some of their songs like ""To Hell With the Devil"" and especially ""Makes Me Wanna Sing"" even support this line of thought. However, if one can get past the style of the music and listen to some of the slower stuff, he/she will be rewarded by more than a few brilliantly-written songs. ""First Love"",""Waiting For A Love..."", as well as a few others on all of the first three Stryper albums show what a talent Michael Sweet has for writing great melodies. If Mr. Sweet would concentrate on songwriting only and discontinue his concern with writing commercial-sounding songs, I believe his would be a household name. Honestly, that's how good some of his songs are. Worth buying even if you listen only to a few cuts."
2,Another sub-par effort.........,"I actually think the band took a step backward with this one. The production is a bit better (thank god.....no pun intended), but I think their debut is better. ""Together As One"" is a pretty good ballad. I didn't care for the rest of the album. If you read my review of 'The Yellow And Black Attack' you would know how I feel about Stryper. I recommend waiting until 'To Hell With The Devil' to start buying their CD's."
4,A must-have for 80's Metal fans,"With the awesome song-writing of Michael Sweet, the phenomenal guitar playing of both himself and fellow guitarist Oz Fox, the cool bass licks of Tim Gaines, and steady beat of ""visual time-keeper"" Robert Sweet, all combined with a very positive message, we have in Stryper's Soldiers Under Command a very good rock album not just for Christian rock fans, but any fan of 80's glam rock/hair rock. I highly recommend this album to anyone wishing to find out what type of music Stryper put out back in their day. The only drawback to the album is the recording quality. Don't get me wrong, it still sounds very good, but the budget for recording for this album was considerably less than it was for their next two albums."
5,Classic Stryper Vinyl!!!,"I bought this vinyl record for 2 reasons: I love Stryper, and I had never seen a white vinyl record before. This record is AWESOME!!!"
5,great album!,"I love the album it was a number #1 album ,because it was a great album when it came to me. I love songs more than any other albums they have put out. I went to that concert too. I wish I can express many more feelings to this album. Thank you."
3,You Call This Christian Metal?!?!?!?!,"Please forgive me...I commend the guys in Stryper for their attempt to reach a hard to reach crowd with the gospel. However, I always felt that their music was a caricature of the real thing. Sort of a ligh aluminum rather than a heavey metal. Their music was way to pop for me, and the opera style singing of the lead singer Makes...me...want...to...GAG!!...Yeah! But seriously...even their outfits were a caricature of the real thing. They went from looking androgenous (the standard Heavy Metal garb of the 80's) to looking positively effeminate. Sometimes in looking at any of Stryper's album covers I was tempted to say, ""What a bunch of hot looking chicks (?!?!?!). If you want real Christian metal try Barren Cross, Darrell Mansfield (circa ""Revelation"", or even Rez Band. Again, I commend Stryper for their attempts at reaching metal heads with the gospel. I just never could take them seriously."
1,A Joke,Every so often a band comes along where praise turns into advertisement. In this case it is an advertisement for Christianity. Stryper = The Beautiful People
4,Strong 2nd album,"Stryper rode the success of their first release ""The Yellow and Black Attack"" into a better recording experience for Soldiers Under Command and it shows. The album starts off with the title song and it doesn't stop moving from there. Their sound is and will always be the straight ahead hard rock of the 80's hair metal days. To say that Christian music hadn't seen anything like them is an under statement. I remember being around 12 years old hearing about these long haired, make up wearing, yellow and black spandex wearing people that threw out New Testament bibles at their concerts and thinking I have to check this out! Each and every song is good and has that mid 80's heavy metal sound that was copied and recopied by many bands. If you enjoyed the 80's hair metal days pick up this album."
3,Good mix of God and Metal.,"I got into them in college, during my metal years. For a poseur band (meaning make-up and look-like-a-girl hair) they had a pretty good grasp of God and how to reach youth for Him. Good concert, good guitar work. Their ""Battle Hymn"" is killer! A must-get if you like good hard metal and want a positive message in the medium."
4,Best CD Stryper ever put out. Hard and powerful....,"This CD is pure, original Stryper from the good old days before the group abandoned it's powerful message. I believe the title track to be the band's best - a combination of powerful lyrics and hard pounding bass and guitars. Notice the way the band is able to keep the guitars together - something you rarely find in rock this hard. ""He is the Rock that makes me Roll"" (Track 4) is similarly great. If you remember Stryper fondly, it's because of the type of music found on this CD. Highly recommended."
1,Freezer Mug That Splits in the Freezer,"I bought this attractive Pittsburgh Pirates mug hoping to have a mug that could handle being repeatedly put in the freezer. Unfortunately it didn't take long for the plastic to develop a small crack that quickly grew into a large crack ( the entire length of the mug ) as moisture collected within the crack and expanded when the mug was put in the freezer. The rubber ""crystal"" insulated material occasionally falls out from the crack. I can still drink from the mug as the crack only affects the outer insulated part, but now the mug really looks like crap. I won't buy another mug made by this company."
5,The heat's only rising....,"Best songs on the disc - Bandages, Get in or Get out, Talk to me Dance with me, oh hell, they're all awesome. Once I buy a CD, I usually pick a new favorite other than the single, but on this CD, the single is just as catchy as every other song on the cd. This album has no low-point, there is not one average song. And Hot Hot Heat has a way of incorporating rock, pop, punk, indie, new age- basically every musical style- into one amazing album. The lyrics are simple, yet captivating, and the music is energizing. There is not much more to ask for. I have also had the experience of seeing a Hot Hot Heat show, and the energy they radiate when performing has been unequaled by every other show I've seen. Invest in this CD, it's just amazing."
2,Much Ado About Nothing,"People can accuse Interpol and The Strokes all they want of shamelessly capitalizing on supposedly undeserved hype, but the one band that took in praise from numerous corners of the music press that left me cold is Hot Hot Heat. Make Up The Breakdown is a decent record, but that's about it. ""No Not Now"" is rather catchy, ""Bandages"" is grating, and everything else is rather ho-hum. Take a group of good-looking guys, make them perform herky-jerky new-wave, and you have instant praise and success. Too bad there's no substance or replay value."
3,Nü-wave,"We've had nü-metal - why not nü-wave? Hot Hot Heat belong to that burgeoning scene merging formative 80's sensibilities with the garage rock aesthetic of 90's post-grunge. (Liars, The Rapture, The Raveonettes, etc.) With their first full-length release, Make Up the Breakdown, this Canadian foursome make like a more insular Drums + Wires-era XTC. The result is ten songs about girl trouble (they don't get outside themselves much), but the real theme of the record is chunky guitar hooks, jaunty keyboards, plucky basslines, and Steve Bays' pleading vocals (think Robert Smith on a caffeine jag). Hot Hot Heat are electroclash with way more guitars and less retro stink. The tunes are short, memorable, witty, repeatable. In short, old-school pop which, if we're lucky, might just be nü-school again."
2,So so....,"Well its catchy.. Thats about it. As one reviewer said, knowing about Hot Hot Heat does not give you indie cred. Read some reviewers other reviews.. Good Charlotte, Green Day.... All that GOOD STUFF.... ahem (Sarcasm) Ok, in this record the band have completely changed their sound, from the raucous screams and keyboard saturated songs of Scenes One Through Thirteen, to the kind of music that appeals to 13 year old girls. I would say it has something to do with their new singer. The only song on this CD that i dont cringe to is Save Us S.O.S. So, if you are looking for some underground, some INDIE, do not look here... Go elsewhere"
2,i want to like them...i really do,"i want to like these guys...i really do...but the fact is, for me, the guys voice is annoying. he just sounds forced, as if he's trying to squeeze too many words into one phrase and he just sounds immature and stupid. someone like jack white, his voice is unique and kinda shocking at first, but it really blends beautifully with the music....the lead singer in hot hot heat sounds like he's trying to do something new, but its just obnoxious...i hate judging and i dont hate them as people or anything, but the fact remains, i get really irritated and even pissed off everytime i hear them. i had to delete all the songs from my computer because i got annoyed just hearing them, especially by that song, touch you...god...i like bandages at first, but not after hearing the rest of the album."
1,Oh the pain and torture...,"I used to work at a store where we played tapes with music videos and such, and a few of the videos had ""bandages"" on it by this band. From the moment I first heard that song I could do nothing but cringe out how annoying the singer's voice and the music was. I had to stop helping customers and fast forward everytime the song came on. And to think some of the reviewers here bought the cd for that song! This is like listening to someone scratching their nails on a chalkboard for an hour. The singer sounds like a midget is jumping up and down on his stomach while he sings. This is nothing like the Cure as reviews say. The Cure is one of my favorite bands and I don't recall getting a headache listening to Robert Smith. Listen to ""Pornography"" or ""Disentegration"", the Cure's finest albums and if you think this is like The Cure you should be locked away. I don't care if you buy a Britney Spears album, just DON'T BUY THIS."
2,you cant teach an old dog new tricks.,"you would think that after 2 albums, the canadian based hot hot heat would be able to come up with some kind of new sound, but alas, its all the same. dancy yes, diverse no. after a while the beats all begin to sound the same."
1,heres a question for you?,"Instead of wasting money on an album that tries really hard to sound like its from 1979, why don't you buy a GOOD ALBUM that actually did come out in 1979. CANADA, STICK TO RUSH. Wheres my goo-goo dolls album?"
4,This One is a Flamethrower,"Being unfamiliar with these indie rock stand outs, I picked up ""Make Up the Breakdown"" intrigued only by their name. They had such a redundantly redundant redundancy that I had to gamble. Well, the payoff was more than I expected. Lead man"
4,Unusually and persistently informed,"Surprised with how this young Canadian indie rock band's full length debut still sounds. After revisiting Franz Ferdiand's debut and feeling the emptiness much more pronounced, I had feared the worse with HHH. They follow some of the same basic tenets those retro dance indie acts cropping up at the time did, but beneath the hipster sheen, youthful spunk, and a voice cynics could simply dismiss as stupid, this essentially pop-rock album for teens incorporates much more subtle melodic progression then most who ever flirted with MTV in the past decade. Unsure if their later material is worth any investment, but this one is."
5,Sing-A-Long fun,This is party music with a 80's new-wave vibe. Every song is a hit and it's so catchy that some of the songs will stay in your head long after hearing them. Get it!
4,Decent Effort,"This is a record you need to spend time with, but it's worth it. It has its quirks and shining moments, but overall I'd consider it a worthy purchase. Angular is a good word to describe it. Some may be put off by the vocals, but that's their loss."
4,Move over Strokes and White Stripes ... here comes some fun!,"With lo-fi garage revivalism storming the airwaves, this latest offering by this Victoria, Canada outfit ought not be missed. Sounding like a hybrid of the Strokes and the White Stripes combined with generous helpings of The Kinks and Buzzcocks -- hell, even the playful side of The Cure thrown in for good measure, this is one fun album that makes for a breath of fresh air from all the aggro ""rebel without a clue"" posturing of so many rock acts today. With a quirky sound and droll lyrics, songs like ""Get In or Get Out"", ""Bandages"", ""Oh, Godamnit"", ""Talk to Me, Dance With Me"" and ""Save Us, S.O.S."" are winners in my book. Here's hoping these guys get some deserved attention."
3,Cool for a while,"Ok, I'm in...But it's not going to last, yes it's got that screech-bop very early XTC thing that works for me but by the end of the CD I was tired and wired. Every effin song is the same tempo and the same key with the same catch. Man I just needed some space when the whole thing was over...To be honest there is some very cool stuff on this record and I'm glad I have it but it's not something I'm going to sit down and listen to, tell you what I will do is put it in with a few other discs on random (during a party) and it'll all be great... It's not a sit down and listen to kinda CD and I can sit down and listen to almost anything..."
2,eh....,"I have a pretty wide music range and I have to say Hot HOt Heat has an alright sound, but its not that appealing. I would rank it two stars, but its barely even that. I thought the album sounded interesting from the clips, but it's just trendy music with no substance (like many other ""rock"" bands). With only one or two memorable songs at most, I'd rather save the money."
2,"some of the music's OK, but...","...the singer nearly ruins every song, and it's really too bad. That voice is just soooo annoying! It hurts!"
2,Didn't Like As Much As I Had Expected...,"Hot Hot Heat are a tiny little band from Vancouver B.C. that plastic-pellet you with harmless, cheeky punk-pop ditties that were already heard on the last Stink-182 album. But I think this band has potential. I think the real problem may lie with the production that I'm sure Sub Pop ""assigned"" to them. Ubiquitous producer Jack Endino had his hand in the goings-on of many second-and-third-rate grunge bands of the late eighties and early nineties, but hasn't coaxed an interesting idea out of a recording artist since at least then. I mean, anyone pick up the new Skin Yard album yet?..."
2,In my humble opinion -,"Guys...it's not that GOOD. I have the album on my computer, and I gave it a few listens, but...it has no substance. It's not interesting or anything new. It's catchy. And irritating, after more than a song or two. That's all (""Bandages"" is enjoyable once in a while, I will concede).If you're looking for catchy and poppy (and there's nothing wrong with that), then buy it. If you want something new and original - don't.And if you want good indie dance/electronica-type music go for something like The Faint, The Bravery, or Le Tigre."
5,Wanna know what i think??,"oh wow. do i like this cd? hell yes. the first time i listened i was belting out ""bandages"" for a week... and im very picky about my music. so if this is your dish...buy it! its a great cd by a great band... the lead singer has a really cool voice, i cant describe it...so yea.. this is a good cd. there."
3,More post-hardcore kids looking for a record deal.,"For a similar but more textured, mature musical experience I would advise looking into the band Cursive. HHH is ok, but ultimatly disposable and borderline annoying. Maybe for the underground it's novel, but to be truly maintream I think they'll need to ""mature"" their sound a bit more (AKA derive sounds from some other popular bands). When do hardcore kids start wearing striped sailor outfits and buckled boots? Well it's better than everyone doing ""garage rock"", eh?"
5,Evocative but not derivative - you MUST BUY IT!!,"Wow. This album is so addictive they should slap a biohazard warning label on it. I literally wake up in the middle of the night with the chorus of ""Oh Goddammit"" roiling in my head. Most certainly my favorite album of the last two years or so.As I listen to them, I'm reminded of a lot of the great, subversive, bouncy pop of the late 70's and 80's like Joe Jackson, Elvis Costello, Oingo Boingo, and others, but thankfully I never feel like they're ripping anyone off. OK, there is one riff on one song that sounds exactly like a riff from a mid-80's Iggy Pop song, but I'm willing to forgive that.Anyway - fantastic stuff this. Forget their earlier, pre-guitar player material. I think the band themselves would agree that this album is where they hit their stride in a big, bold way."
4,to remember good times,"The music'selection in Antologia Latina of Ray Conniff is quite simply splendid.Moreover, the quality of recording is astonishing.The arrangements in ""Cama y mesa"" and ""Brazil"", in my opinion,are without remarks.Thank you very much."
4,CX bike tube,This is my spare tube for my CX bike. Good tube to carry on in case I get a flat. Reasonable price.
5,"Fresh,clean superb rock...IT RULES","John Blanco's lead vocals offer his audience choir- like ,highly trained, superb singing. The keyboards , guitars and drums compile a technically phenominal sound and are as tight as a drum.. Good work,cool lyrics..ROCK AND ROLL!!"
4,Good review,Great service. I like the tote but it was just a little bigger than I thought but still very useful. Good price also.
3,Fun Reading Not so much for Recipes - Many Game recipes,Great to read for the stories of the author growing up - the glimpse into another's life & cultural differences was appealingly writtern. But as for recipes - the lack of precise measurements & high number of game recipes was disappointing.
5,easy and awesome,I grew up in St. Helena Island (Frogmore). Having and using this book brings back those memories
5,Stands test of time...,"As well as being a great bag in every way, this bag is so well made, it still looks brand new even though I've been using it for around four years. It's worth every penny."
5,More hottest hard rock hits by Queen themselves!,"Hollywood Records released Classic Queen, a compilation that covered Queen's hits from 1982 to it's demise in 1991 with a few older songs thrown in. Then it released this album collection, its US version of Greatest Hits which is a 15-track album that deletes the songs from the first Greatest Hits [UK] version that also appeared on Classics (among them Queen's biggest hit ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") and adds a few tracks from the 1973-1982 era that did not appear on the original release label Elektra. Fans don't seem to have minded, as this other Greatest Hits CD sold better instead!"
5,Greatest hits from the Greatest Rock band ever,"Queen was the greatest rock band ever and the greatest musical act of the 20th century.This album has most of the same songs as The original Queen Greatest hits album , first released in 1981 , except that it omits the classic rock-opera masterpiece Bohemian Rhapsody , which was included in the Classic Queen album released at the same time , and it includes Queen's erotic-disco hit from 1982 , Body Language.The debonair Killer Queen (1974)The rollicking Fat Bottomed Girls (1978)The laidback You're My Best Friend (1975)The glam rock Seven Seas of Rhye (1974)The funky Don't Stop Me Now (1978)The hypnotic Somebody To Love (1976)and the whimsical Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy (1976)"
4,Still good without Bohemian rhapsody,"As it says, contains Queen greatest hits. Great introduction to classics like: Don't stop me now, We will rock you and We are the champions If you want to go further in Quen you might get A night at the opera, Jazz or A night at the races"
5,Long Live the Queen!,"Each song a classic (although some were only BIG hits in the UK, so the casual listener may not be familiar with all of them). Unfortunately, this CD does not include all the ""hits"" - the rest are on ""Classic Queen"". Buy both, and you're all set! Go ahead, treat yourself, YOU DESERVE IT!!!"
1,Unhappy,Queen rules. This is a must have cd. If you like queen get this cd now. Don't wait I got mine
3,Queen cd through Amazon.com,"Received the cd in stated time, but was a bit dissapointed that the case was cracked since thought it was to be new. Cd was fine though."
3,QUEEN GREATEST HITS,I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR THE FIRST SONGS. THE REST OF THE ALBUM IS FORGETABLE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED. THE BICYCLE SONG IS LAME. BUT HEY: THIS IS 80'S MUSIC SO ONE MUST HAVE A LITTLE UNDERSTANDING..
1,Most of their worst material is included in this collection,"I know I am going to make some enemies today, but I just can't stand this collection. Sure, they may have changed music with ""We are the champions / We Will Rock You"" and ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" but I HATE ""I want to break free"" and ""Bicycle Race"" and ""Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy"".... About every other song is trash.. Don't Get It... If you want an album that you can listen to the whole way through- Get ""A Night At The Opera"".. has their classic song ""Bohemian Rhapsody"", not to mention the fact that they make better ALBUM TRACKS then hits, so you will NOT be disappointed..... :)"
5,A great way to start,This was the first Queen release I ever had. I got more familiar with them the past year and the collection is still growing. Not the exact same lineup as the UK release or the Elektra LP.
3,No Princes of the Universe??,"For all the people complaining that there is no Bohemian Rhapsody here that is because it is on the companion album, Classic Queen. Which has way more of my favorites on it. This album may have Queen's greatest hits, but come on, how can you include ""Body Language"" over ""Princes of the Universe"". I'm not too happy with the song selection. What were they thinking??"
1,It doesn't have what?,How can you call a Queen album 'Greatest Hits' if it doesn't have Bohemian Rhapsody on the playlist?
5,the best,i love this cd long time i was looking for this album and finally i have't i love the songs makes me remember my past thanks
1,Queen - The Most Overrated and Worst Artist In Music History,"Queen never had talent. They're just an overrated rock group justlike AC/DC, Aerosmith, & Nirvana. Awful songs like We Are The Champions and Another One Bites The Dust reek. The only good song is We Will Rock You. And plus, they're always played on the radio. This music is just one every rock fan should avoid. Buy any album from The Beatles, Dire Straits, or Green Day insted.Queen sucks,I know what music's best."
4,okay,the cd is alright but it doesn't include the most classic song they ever made bohemean rapsody.
4,No Bohemian Rhapsody,"This is a very Queen album, but it doen't have Bohemian Rhapsody on it and thats their best song. Still you should definitley get it if you can."
4,Get this c.d,"It is a great c.d even for people who have never bought queen i would reccomend it.I only wish it had the songs Bohemian Rhaspody and Ogre battle but my favorite songs are Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy,Killer Queen and Cant Stop me Now.Well i hope this helped and i would definately reccomend this c.d!"
1,Sacrilege version of Greatest Hits by Queen,"This version of Queen's Greatest Hits CD is blasphemous compared to the original version that Elektra issued in 1981 and Hollywood issued as the 2-CD Greatest Hits Vols. 1 and 2 in 1995. This CD released in '92 has the album version of Fat Bottomed Girls instead of the single mix. Plus, Bohemian Rhapsody was removed and placed on Classic Queen which was the US version of Greatest Hits 2 which is absolutely wrong. Plus, some of the songs were from 1982 and 1984 where the original GH's song lineup went to 1981. Buy either the gold GH 1 and 2 set or the recently issued The Platinum Collection(all three British Greatest Hits albums in one set)instead of this garbage."
5,Great greatest hits collection,"Rework Classic Queen and Queen's Greatest Hits, mix and match the tracks and that'd be your Queen's greatest hits. However, there is nothing wrong with this one, don't get me wrong, every track on here is classic Queen, Freddy is one of the greatest song writer/frontmen of all time. Queen is one of the greatest bands of all time. This has some of their best, starting with We Will Rock you/We Are The Champions and then Crazy Little Thing Called Love, and arguably thier most popular song, Another One Bites The Dust, this greatest hits has it all."
5,The best queen album out there.,The best queen album out there. The other greatest hits ablums of theres can't even compare.
4,Missing a good song...,"Queen was a band that no one really did care to listen for cause of Freddie, but many that didnt care about what he wore or done love Queen and their work. Most songs I am not big on, but many of them are absoulte genius.There's something about this album though that I saw ealier on a review, which was very correct. ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" and ""Under Pressure"" were missing those were Queen's finest works. I dont know how you could forget those two songs."
2,WHAT??!?!?!?!?,this is a pretty good queen greatest hits cd with just most of their popular radio hits and i gave it two stars for the one problem i had with this cd WHERE IN THE HECK IS BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY?!?!?!?!?!?!?? for that reason alone nobody should buy this cd go and look for a better greatest hits cd of queen one that has RHAPSODY!!!
4,They are very talented,"They are a very talented band. The best songs on here are We are the Champions, Another One Bites the Dust, We Will Rock You. Buy this it is good."
4,"Starts Out Good, ends bad","The first four songs are great, but then they have some less worthwile songs to fill out the middle. Track 12 is good, then things fall apart."
5,Intersting Package of Hits,"Queen was a talented band, and there's just no questioning that. I have a hard time writing a review for this album, because I pretty much bleed Queen. I become greatly annoyed when someone thinks Freddie Mercury was the only real talent in Queen. This album doesn't help to promote my cause. But, if you are a casual Queen fan, as I once was, this will satisfy your needs. It has most of the hits, put together in an odd way none the less, but good. I give it five stars just as an overall. It might be missing some hits, it might have a few songs that really shouldn't be on there, but who are we to decide anyway?"
3,"Title should be ""Dude, That's Messed Up""...","since it deliberately does not include Bohemian Rhapsody and a few other hits, leaving them for the Classic Queen CD. I will readily admit I'm not a big fan of Queen's stuff after Under Pressure (another hit not included on this). I prefer their earlier work. But a solid half of this CD (and the ""Classic Queen"" CD) is that later-80's-'yeah, this is Queen but I'll always skip these tracks since they're not that good'-stuff.Presumably, the record company thought they needed to save a few hits for the Classic Queen release, or no one would buy it. That CD (which I got as well) also suffers from too much unknown later crap; if they'd loaded Classic Queen with earlier quality album tracks, I would have been quite happy.But they didn't, so I'll probably wind up getting Day At The Races and Night At The Opera as well, if not Sheer Heart Attack. To me, THAT stuff is Queen at their best. This, while worthwhile for the hits, is, ummm... messed up."
5,What more can I say?,"It seems pretty obvious from this excellent compilation Queen's appeal went beyond Freddie Mercury's flamboyant on-stage antics. There music was fresh, entertaining and so much different from the usual 70s fare. Such classics as 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and 'We Will Rock You' are good, but its less well known but just as good songs like 'Seven Seas of Rhye' and 'Don't Stop Me Now.' that really stand out."
4,Awesome trip down memory lane,This album is great! It contains some of the more obscure hits from Queen as well as the popular ones. The only thing missing is Bohemian Rhapsody.
1,Psuedo-scientific theism disguised as real science,Both logic and science are faulty in this book. This is little more than another weak attempt to establish a scientific basis for theism. Theism is about faith. Science is about evidence. The author fails miserably to link the two.
3,Only works with LeapPad Plus Writing Learning System,"I saw princesses, got excited, and ordered this LeapPad book. Please note that it only works with the LeapPad Plus Writing Learning System. I didn't realize this when I ordered this for my daughter that has a LeapPad Plus Microphone Learning System. I thought the books would work on all systems, just would not have the writing features.The book features mazes, sequences, writing numbers, matching, shapes, counting, and some addition."
2,"Childish writing, redundant themes, bad in every way.",A Haiku on John Green's Looking for Alaska:I want my time backWhy is this book so well liked?What the hell John Green?
4,Excellent Debut,"John Green's writing is fluid, sharp, and honest. I read the book before realizing it was his debut novel -- shocking. My teenage years are far, far behind me, but the clarity of this story brought back the angst, friendship, and fun like it was yesterday.All in all an excellent story that left me wishing I'd read it slower so it wouldn't be over yet."
4,Looking for Alaska,I like this book has a real meaning to it however the beginning was slow and had some nasty scenes in it but this book has strong words that make you forget about that! And it's a small book not to many pages.
4,Use a Bookmark,"I was caught in this book from the very beginning. Solid YA literature though it might be a bit too much for the ultra conservative. I think the message overpowers it all in the end. I checked it out from the library, read it and eventually purchased it for my own digital collection. If you get the print version be carefully not to inadvertently flip to the back pages. John Green has some review questions that will kind of ruin the whole thing if you do. The very first one question to be exact. Take my word for it. Even having the whole before/after aspect ruined I still enjoyed it. A story well written and well told."
4,Looking for Alaska,"For the most part I liked this book, however, I actually kind of found Alaska annoying. I would recommend this book to high schoolers"
5,Looking for Alaska,Good read overall. It is a life lesson. And deserves the time. This book is is is a fighter. Hi
3,Poignant at start but loses momentum towards end,"Overall a good read for the young adult, however lost momentum the last third of the book. I think his other book ""A Fault In Our Stars was much better""."
5,Meep,"Meep meep meep THIS BOOK IS AMAZING! And if u think this review isn't helpful go read the book. Yeah just read it, you'll like it."
4,"John Green's ""Looking for Alaska""",They promised a book in good shape and that's what I got.A little scuff here and there on the sleeve but books are about content not aesthetics.Great price and fast shipping. I will defiantly make this my go to for buying books.
4,Liked It Didn't Love It..,"I enjoyed reading this book. It was a good reccomendation from a friend who is a huge John Green fan. I wish the fact that I didn't like Alaska, didn't make a difference in how much I liked the book, but it did.. Otherwise this was a five star read for sure. I will be reading his other books now as well..."
5,one of the best books ever,"I absolutly love this book. I read it quite awhile ago but I still remember it very clearly. It's so easy to fall for the characters of John's books, and i believe that that is what makes a good book. You will laugh and you will cry. You will feel the character's loss. You will not be able to stop untill the last page and then you willl be back for more."
5,an incredible book,"it was the greatest book i've ever read. anyone who is criticizing it for being ""crude"" should simply shut up. its realistic, what do you think teenagers these days go around speaking perfectly and don't drink or smoke? get real. if anything its a reason NOT to drink considering i'm sure most people are devastated to what happens to alaska. its a great read"
2,I want to like this book,"but I can't. This book has some dull characters and is excessively, boringly, predictable. The book counts down to the main event leaving you underwhelmed at the books apex of plot development. From there on out it stutters along mourning and guilt over the death of a character. There is little else except the prank and the discovery that the two key characters aren't all to blame (thank lord jesus, I suppose)The book tries to be cutting edge by letting the characters curse, pull pranks, drink, TALK about sex, and develop their sexuality in a forced sort of ""everyday kid"" but ultimately awkward ways. In summary this sounds fine but the way its pulled off is just contrived and uninteresting.I can't think of any reason you shouldn't read a much better written book about tragedy; there are literally hundreds. My favorite is Perks of Being a Wallflower. There is also Speak and a few others I can't think of. Good luck.edit for plausibility/contrived contradiction."
2,Creases and rips in the book,"I received the book with multiple creases and a rip on the cover page. There were also several pages that were bent. The book itself is good, but the scratched up quality is very distracting. This was intended as a present, so the appearance was pretty disappointing."
4,Very Deep,"It makes you stop and think about little things you usually don't think about , a really good book but could drag on at some points"
4,Touching,"I really enjoyed. They beginning was very funny and light, but the ending was sad. Over all, I enjoyed it."
3,Good,"It seems like it kept going on, but maybe that's because I lost focus. I would recommend it, though. Yup..."
5,Speachless,"John green you have done it again. You just have a way, that is unexplainable, but yet uplifting. You truly are an amazing writer."
2,"Disappointing, lazy ending","I had to get this book after reading all the rave reviews, but I have to be honest: the story has a strong set up and message, but a really lazy follow-through. The ending is very very rushed and almost meaningless and the last half of the book is pretty boring."
3,Not worth a major literary prize,"This novel is targeted for a young adult audience. I bought it because it won the Michael Prinz Award for Young Adult Literature and I am looking for new novels that I and the teachers in my English Department can use with our high school students. However, I found the writing style to be mediocre and the plot only marginally engaging. The protagonist is difficult to identify with because he has no problems that evoke sympathy in the reader. Even the supposed passion he harbors for the character Alaska leaves the reader cold."
2,mediocre ...at best,"This book is not very good. Every word seems calculated and is technically ""right"" but I found myself not caring about these characters.There is a distinct lack of depth to these characters and we never get to see below the surface. Reading this book is like watching a talented boxer dance beautifully around the ring, but never throw a punch. Something seems to be missing. It moves along in an obvious way, sort of like a new TV show, and its structure is representative of what passes for art in the 21st century, but it left me cold. I want so much more than a tepid, quirky, cleverly concocted story like this. It seems to have been written with a particular audience and a particular batch of critics in mind. The overall tone of the book is very smug, while pretending not to be. I think Green has some talent, but I think he should stop writing what everybody wants him to write."
4,"A very good book, perfect for a little escape","I gave this book a try because someone told me it was similar to Knowles' A Separate Peace, which is a book I love. This is kind of written in the same style, told through the eyes of a teenage boy, at a private school. It follows his friendships with a group of very different people, focusing on his admiration & fascination of a girl classmate. I enjoyed the story. It certainly is a young adult book, but still entertaining and not ""tweenie"" as so many books in that genre seem to be. I plan to read more of this author's works."
4,Life changing,"Although this book touches on sensitive topics such as teen drinking, smoking, and sex, it is a very helpful book for teenagers and I would recommend this book to any young adult that is still trying to understand themselves. This book really illustrates the life changing events and how powerful the pivotal moments in our lives can be."
2,Meh,"Maybe I'm just too old to be reading this book, but I didn't find it particularly intriguing or interesting. I had high expectations for the book because I kept seeing people quote lines from it all over the internet, but I definitely could have gone without reading it."
5,"Cry, laugh, learn","John Green is genius. All nerd fighters as well as anyone who has read his novels will recognize this. Looking for Alaska is my favorite work of his, he captures what it is to be a teenager and connects to four (arguably five) characters that will take you for an emotional roller coaster. With an ending that is, well, tear-jerkingly hilarious.. READ THIS BOOK.Looking for Alaska"
5,Sneakily Cerebral,A young adult book... but so much more. It's fantastic. I cant wait to read the other John Green novels.
4,Before and After,"I like the before and after context of the story. It set the pace as well as the mood, so perfect for a coming-of-age novel. This book has all the elements - friendship, family, loss, grief, guilt, coping through it all.The story is indeed heavy but just the same, the author was able to lighten it with splashes of youth - things that teens think, say and do that make adults like myself (and like at least 2 of the adult characters in the book) shake our heads while smiling secretly.This just goes to say that we were also teens once - we've all been there, we've all done that. But now it's the younger set's turn to discover and we must let them be."
4,Great surprise,Stumbled upon this great read. Don't simply just read it..explore yourself as you do. Says for high schoolers but I am a junior in college and still really enjoyed it!!
4,Beautifully written but...,"I finished the novel in one sitting. It was beautifully written, but it didn't impact me as much as John Green's 'The Fault in our Stars.' I just wasn't that emotionally attached to the characters. I had very high expectations based off of all the reviews, so it left me slightly disappointed. Despite my letdown, I would still recommend it."
5,My new favorite book,"This book really made me think. About friendship, love, life, and mostly how to make the pain we all experience in life bearable."
5,Very intriguing.,I loved this book. First of all it's a short read. I have gotten two of my friends to read it in the past week and they both loved it. It's amazing because you don't see many of these types of books written by male authors. John Green gives new life to this type of literature and I am excited to read An Abundance of Katherines next.
2,Not as good as other ones...,"I think John Green is a good writer, but I've read three of his books now and they all feature the same sort of characters (a boy in love with a girl, the girl is a bit of a ingenue, a nerdy male side-kick friend). A lot of his stories also feature pranks and references to literature. I liked Paper Towns and A Fault in Our Stars, but this book was a bit more tedious for me to read. It took me a couple of days. I didn't find myself caring about the characters that much. The person I liked most was Mr. Hyde and he is a secondary character. I think I am going to take a little break from Mr. Green's work. It is still good, it still deserves awards, but I just need a bit of distance from it all."
2,Review from MajiBookshelf Blog,"I heard great things about this book, so when we saw it in the library, we decided to borrow it. Unfortunately, I didn't see what was so great about this book after all. Just wasn't my cup of tea.Miles goes to boarding school to find his ""Great Perhaps"" and then meets some kids. He becomes friends with them, crushes on one of them, and they all mess around causing trouble.The whole time I was reading, I was asking myself, ""Why am I reading about a couple of school kids messing around?"". There wasn't a point to the story until ""after"" something happened, which happens more than halfway through the book.The ""after"" part does stir some things up and kind of makes the book interesting. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't talk much about the ""after"" event. It was a shock, and held great meaning towards the end, but overall I was just disappointed."
1,SOB STORY,"I hopped on the John Greene train and hopped off after reading this trainwreck. I admit, though cheesy, I enjoyed part one of the novel. Then whoa, part 2, what happened? That just wasn't cool, part two. I actually cringed at the ""rap battle"" Pudge and the gang had. Cringed. Awful. I guess I'm too old for this novel."
1,Not very good.,"I'm almost embarrassed to say it because I am a fan of John Green's other books and I am a nerdfigther, but this book sucked. I knew what the general plot was going to be about a chapter into the book, the characters weren't great and it was painfully boring. His other books are great, especially Abundance of Catherines."
1,A waste of time for me :(,"I was so disappointed in this book. I think I might have been able to deal with the contents of the story more easily if the characters had been a bit older. I didn't like to read about such young people dealing with all the sex and drinking. Maybe I am really out of the loop on how things are, but I just didn't get into this story at all. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone I know to read. :("
1,Highly Inappropriate for a School Library,"Due to the sections where the 2 main characters (male and female) are watching porn movies together and the comments she makes to instruct the teen boy and the sections on their rather graphic sexual experiences together, this book is VERY inappropriate for a school HS library. Language is also crude."
2,bad condition,The book is good but i think i paid to much for a discarded library book i should of just bought a new one for a couple more dollars
3,Not what I expected,"I suppose I was hoping for a bit more action and not so much sadness. The book is well written and I really liked Pudge, but I can't say I agree with the person who suggested this one to me and told me it was amazing. It was good, but didn't quite live up to all the hype."
5,"""Miles, as in 'to go before I sleep?""","I adored John Green's Looking for Alaska. I read this for a YA book group and couldn't tear myself away from the story of Miles Hunter and his entry into boarding school. I fell in love with the all the characters through Miles' narration, and longed for my own time at boarding school. Colonel cracked me up. Alaska broke my heart and I fell for her as easily as Miles did.Some members of my reading group found Looking for Alaska predictable, but I didn't see the plot taking the swerve it did. I wouldn't recommend this read for anyone under 14. The kids of Culver Creek drink, smoke, swear, and have sex; so if you want to shield yourself or your child from these topics in YA lit steer away. But for those of you looking for a smart, funny, heart-wrenching book you've come to the right place."
2,loved him on youtube...,"i am a big reader, and i'm also into weird animal facts: enter John Green's ""Top Ten Animal Power Moves"" YouTube clip which I came across randomly. I clicked around some more while in the Vlog Brothers rabbit hole and found out that John Green is a novelist. I didn't realize initially that YA meant Young Adult, because of my limited exposure to the genre. Instead I actually thought people were just really enthusiastic about his work, so I ordered Looking For Alaska. It didn't have any emotional or philosophical resonance with me. I finished it because he is easy to read and occasionally funny, and at least engaging enough that I kept at it hoping for the book to plunge into something to which I can relate. That moment never happened for me, and I would not recommend this book to anyone over the age of 12."
4,great book for teens/young adult,A nice story of a young man getting a fresh start and finding that it is ok to be different and unique. Great friendships are formed as we see Pudge fit-in. However the loss of Alaska slaps us into reality...how our actions and choices can last a lifetime.
4,"Okay, doesn't live up to the hype","Having seen this book/quotes contained in this book/raves about this book EVERYWHERE, I bought it for myself. When reading Looking for Alaska in its entirety, however, it didn't exactly live up to my expectations. Certain passages and quotes, when pulled out and stood alone, are so beautiful and honest and poetic that it literally took my breath away BUT the book as a whole isn't like that. Still, I don't regret buying it. It's not a bad read."
5,Famous last words,"In his YA novel, LOOKING FOR ALASKA, John Green brilliantly weaves the themes of friendship, loss, grief and coping. The authentic voices and real issues of teens flow throughout the book. The main characters explore how to ""get out of this labyrinth,"" while at the same time ""seeking a Great Perhaps."" It is a quick read that both teens and adults will love."
3,It was an alright story had I been younger,"Miles aka Pudge is your average high school reject. He leaves his life behind in Florida to attend a preparatory school in pursuit of a ""great perhaps"". Here he joins his first real clique of friends and experiences drinking, cigarettes, pranks, and dating. The book is split into two parts, the before and the after of an awful event.The before was very entertaining and a good story of coming-of-age. The after was very rushed and I found myself reading very fast just so I could finish it not to drag out the story any more than I had to. The ending was very phony. Like it was an attempt to be some kind of moving dialogue made to change the lives of the readers forever. It just felt to fake and dry. The book is great for incoming freshman I suppose but college age students that enjoy reading young adult fiction might feel a little to above this book."
5,Dark but real,This book was like a look into the mind of another person and realizing that we're not all these bright happy creatures. There isn't always a happy ending- just an ending
3,predictable,good book! but the countdown the chapter titles portray is easily figured out. makes you think about life and its many meanings.
5,Wonderfully dark,"A dark, poignant story about friendship and growing up and the mistakes that come along with it. Thought-provoking and original. Loved it."
3,mmm was ok,"I chose this book looking at the reviews as they were all good, but it was disappointing, it took ages to get into but it was alright."
4,Great!,"Really good book. Great quotes, and a lot to reflect on. When I'm gonna leave this labyrinth? X x x"
5,What a great story!,"I had heard from many people that this book was a good read, but it wasn't until I began reading it that I truly understood what they meant. It is a captivating, moving story about one teenager's journey to become part of a group in a new school. You meet all kinds of unique characters along the way, eventually getting to the point that you know them well enough to practically know what kind of response they're going to have. I flew through this book within a couple days, though I'm sure with an open schedule I could have finished it in one...not so much because its not a particularly lengthy novel, but because I was so wrapped up in the intertwined stories of all these kids that I had to know what was going to happen next.If you're looking for something compelling to read, look no further than ""Looking for Alaska"". :)"
5,One of the Most Stunning Young Adult Books in the Past 10 Years,"Positively amazing. FINALLY we get a main character with a personality, a character who's not a loser, whon's not hopeless and desperate and grieving and purposefully searching, he just IS. And he embodies the teenage spirit so quickly and so purely. _Looking for Alaska_ perfectly balances introspective and extrospective, as Pudge's emotional relationships with the people around him contrast with his poignantly hilarious inner thoughts."
2,Struggle,"This was one of those books that I was tempted to stop reading in the middle. I am glad I finished it, but I am not sure if the message at the end of the book was worth getting through the all the mud at the beginning. I would not want my teenage children reading this book."
1,"If you are not 13, don't read this!","I heard SO many amazing reviews about this and am a huge fan of the author's YouTube videos but was incredibly disappointed with this book. The entire book was teenagers talking and it was very predictable. There was little plot and mostly just talking. The book chapter titles consisted of the number of days ""until it happened"" which created greater predictability and a desire for ""it"" to just happen already!"
1,A Note to Parents:,"Good story, well-written, BUT: parents may want to know that by page 25, the author had dropped the ""F"" bomb, used the words ""Jesus"" and ""Christ"" as curses, said ""ass----"" and ""sh--"", and had made positive references to cigarettes, alcohol, teen sex, ""boob""s, and pornography. In addition, many characters proudly rebel against authority, have disdain for their elders, and one character's parents are alcoholics and physically abusive.This school is required reading at my local high school. Sigh."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this CD because I know one of the guys in the band. People in an internet discussion group I belong to described it as a kind of poor man's Foreigner or Palbo Cruise (as if the poor man didn't already have Foreigner and Pablo Cruise!). The playing and singing is perfectly fine, but most of the songs just zipped past me without leaving any impression at all.The reason I'm posting this review, however, is to point out the fact that the single disc I received from the Marketplace listing did not include all the songs from the original two disc set. I can't say I was crushed emotionally by this, but let the buyer beware."
4,comprehensive,"This is comprehensive and complete! we are planning on moving to the area next year and this atlas gives the lay of the land. The page numbering system is a bit odd (non-sequencial) but okay. The index is excellent with extensive listings of points of interests/school etc. Since it has a spiral binding, pages do not meet so following from page to page is a little awkward. Overall excellent for our needs."
5,TO HELL W/ RATINGS,"POSITVE MESSAGE!THIS MUSIC GIVES US HOPE OF THINGS TO COME.I AM NOT RELIGEOUS. BUT I KNOW WHAT SOUNDS GOOD.IF YOU PUT SATANIC WORDS TO THESE LYRICS IT WOULD STILL SOUND GOOD. REMEMBER, IT'S THE MUSIC.I MIGHT BECOME RELIGEOUS IF OTHER CHRISTIAN BANDS SOUND THIS GOOD"
5,EXQUISITE MELODIC METAL,"I can't think of a band more underrated than Stryper.Amidst the 80s hair metal movement (Poison; Ratt; Dokken; etc) this band knew how to play their instruments and also how to write good hooks and choruses.In addition to those qualities their vocalist and main songwriter, Michael Sweet was (and is) a powerful force.Truly one of the best vocalists i have ever heard.In this album, their third overall, they peaked in all aspects: musicianship, production, performance and strenght of songs.If you don't end up with the chorus of More Than A Man in your head long after hearing it, you are not a human being.Highly recommended, essential album."
1,"Seriously folks, five stars?","The main fault with Amazon's on-line reviews is that people can hand out five stars like candy. I feel sorry for the poor metal-head who takes Stryper homes and wonders why he's been betrayed. Stryper was a fun novelty in the 80's, a Christian metal group. But songs like ""Honesty"" and ""To Hell with the Devil"" aren't metal classics, they're jokes that now sound hopelessly outdated. So do yourself a favor and leave heavy-metal to Satan."
1,UMMMM???,"I remember it like it was yesterday, ... You see, I read all the great reviews ..., and figured it had to be great. And what's more, these guys were using their talents to glorify the lord God. However, I finally listened to the album on the way home in my car, and almost wrecked it. Why, you ask? Because I was driven to tears at how utterly bad this music was. I am convinced that Jesus Christ himself wept at the sound of Stryper. I feel sorry for the Lord because the only bands that glorify his name are generaly the worst bands in existence. If you really want to listen to redundant Christian lyrics, buy a DC Talk album because they don't disgrace the genre of Christian rock like STRYPER...... And what's with the name Stryper anyway??"
1,Aweful,"I can't belive this was a good selling album in the 80's, compared to every other talented metal band from that era this stinks."
4,pretty good,"A quick story, I was 7 or 8 years old in the early 80s. My cousins, all metalheads, would pick a band that was their band. They were all a little older than me, so Sabbath, Maiden, Priest, Ozzy solo were all taken. One day at a K-Mart I seen a Stryper album and picked it up. My dad didn't mind, he was a minister so he was all for his little boy getting into Christ rock. Well that was 20 some years ago and I still listen to Stryper. No band has churned out great album after great album like Stryper and their live stuff is even better. If you check them out and think that you can't understand the words, give it time. I'm not your typical Stryper listener, day job is fish factory manager but when the car starts up to go home there is always Stryper. You really need these albums. This is AC/DC, the Ramones and Metallica combined to the nth power then crammed into a box and pulverized into rock in its purest form by God Himself. Drop to your knees and pray to our rock Gods."
5,this is an awsome album!!,"Stryper is all around a good band and this album rocks. They are a good hair metal band and they are a good Christian band. I know people who are't Christians and they love Stryper. This is a really good hair metal album whether you are a Christian or not. Micheal Sweet has an awsome voice and his and Oz Fox's guitar playing is really good. I recomend this album to anyone who likes 80's hair metal or Christian music. Buy this album, it's worth it."
4,Great metal vocalist!!!,"In response to Marc Butler's review. Just because these guys have a strong commitment to christ, doesn't mean the MUSIC doens't have value. Agreed, most would prefer no political agenda tied to the music, but these guys were genuine, leave 'em alone and listen to the tunes.I am NOT a practicing christian, but I am a trained vocalist and former vocal coach, and if you like good metal singers, you should add this album to your collection. Micheal Sweet has arguably the most beautiful tenor voice in the genre'......listen to the samples.....the tunes rock, are hook oriented, and even if your not a bible thumper, you will still find meaning in this recording......."
3,"Superb music, arrogant lyrics.","Musically, Stryper was one of the best bands of the 1980s, and this CD features some of their finest song writing. The music features heavy riffs, good melodies, tight solos and smooth vocal harmonies. Unfortunately, the lyrics were as arrogant as they were preachy. Probably without intending to, Stryper ends up implying that Christians constitute a sort of master race, while non-Christians are somehow inferior."
1,I still havn't got my record yet!,The only reason I'm giving a bad review is because I still havnt got my item yet that I ordered more than a month ago. I didn't know any other way of getting ahold of the seller until I found this....
3,Misleading title,"...I will merely say that this so-called dicitionary, though a dictionary of sorts, is limited to words found in the Suttas. It does NOT contain the real hairy words that were invented later and for which one would really need a dictionary.It does not contain, for example, words like MADHYAMIKA, ADVAYA, SAMSKRTA--all fairly commonly used philosophical terms by latter day Buddhist thinkers. That is why I say the title is misleading--it gives you the impresion that it is more comprehensive than the author ever intended. It took me a while to figure this out and was disappointed on many an occasion, wasting time looking up words this book could not possibly contain.It should have been titled < A Concise Dictionary of Buddhist Terms found in the Suttas>."
2,Theravada approach,"This has a good scholarly approach to pali and Thai buddhism, but is therefore limited and in a sense contains a hidden bias. This can be a supplement to a dedicated students library, but not to be used as a first book about Buddhism. See Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book to learn how to practice and do Buddhism (which includes a good glossary[ASIN:1477294163 Buddhist Sutras: Lesson Book: Introduction to Rational Buddhism]."
3,Buddhist dictionary,"This was a very old copy, yellowed pages. There are not as many terms in the dictionary as I would like to have made use of.For the price I thought the book would be more complete. Smaller book, old, yellowed pages. Many of the terms are not actually defined, but a symbol is given or a term in another language."
2,to much henry,"I was hoping for more never heard tabak songs, instead i got too many small songs i was very dissapointed."
4,Henry Small is incredible.,The pre(HenrySmall) music is not the greatest but the HS tracks are very strong. Henry is one of the most underated vocalists there is.
4,Great old school death/thrash,"They are a great old school (1983) band, and this album is awesome, especialy for the year it was recorded. The lyrics are based on the readings of H.P. Lovecraft. So you know the songs are dark and twizted. This is a great album and worth checking out, way ahead of their time"
5,One of my favorite books ever.,"I don't know what I expected when I picked up this book, but I definitely did not expect to read one of the funniest and most memorable books I have ever read. I found myself laughing out loud several times during this book (loudest perhaps at the scene where Mack walks, reluctantly, down the Holy Road).Much like in ""White Widow"", the author does a wonderful job of taking you to another time and place.Soon after I finished this book (years after it was written) I was thrilled to learn that there is a continuation of the life of The One Eyed Mack, in ""Crown Oklahoma"". I can't wait to start it."
4,Some great play ideas for kids with ASD,"This book is what the title describes. It's not ""sexy reading"", and it's takes a little work to get through it, but it gives parents some great ideas for playing with their ASD kids. Heck, it has some great ideas for playing with normal/typical kids, too. If you are looking for some inspiration for working with your little one, I recommend."
4,A good spectrum of sound...,"Canadian rockers Prism were unfairly lost in the shuffle of Yes/Styx clone bands that proliferated in the mid to late 70's.This anthology CD is a worthy addition to any rock collection, packed full of hook-laden, anthemic numbers featuring expert musicianship and soaring harmonies.If you enjoy bands like Starcastle, Lake, and ""pre-commercial"" Ambrosia, you'll love this one!"
2,"A Missing Link, Of Sorts","While this Canada band never made much of a splash outside of Canada they did represent something of a missing link between the pompous ""progressive rock"" of the early and mid 70's (Yes, Emerson Lake and Palmer, and pre-Phil Collins Genesis) and the generic arena rock the was in vogue in the late 70's to mid 80's (Styx, Journey, REO Speedwagon). Although they managed to land a total of five songs on the US singles chart only one of those, ""Don't Let Him Know,"" was able to crack the top 50 were it peaked at #39 in the late winter/early spring of 1982. If that song is even remembered today at all it is as the subject of trivia as it was written by one Bryan Adams who himself would make a big splash on the arena rock circuit during much of the mid 80's beginning about a year and a half later.It is difficult to imagine anyone getting too terribly excited about this stuff at this late date, but if this is still your sort of thing, here you are. Have at it."
3,dual disc problems?,"This disc and the ones that followed did not age as well as the earlier TH discs. But my main question is whether I'm the only who has had trouble playing CD side of this disc in most of my players. Regularly comes up as ""Nonformatted"". Beware, especially if you're buying the full ""Brick"" set."
2,Live Is Better,"Except for the last track, this record is severely limited by sterile studio production and performance. For a glimpse at the real potential of what Talking Heads and these songs are capable of, check out the live video Stop Making Sense."
1,Dual Disks stink,Thanks Rhino/Warners for beta testing a failed format on your customers. I can't even comment on the music because the format is so flawed.
4,Good pop music,"This is definitely the Talking Heads' best album without Brian Eno. It's by far their most accessible, but also quite inventive. Losing Eno, this group could easily have retrogressed into the mode of producing cheap, unimaginative imitations of the sound he previously created for them -- enjoying Top-40 success but committing musical suicide. This, incidentally, is precisely what DEVO did after Brain parted company with them (and to a slightly lesser extent, David Bowie in the mid-80s). The Heads, on the other hand, had in David Byrne a near-equal to Eno (some would say protege and not be far off the mark) in studio experimentation and vision. Byrne collaborated with Eno a few years before on the excellent ""My Life in the Bush of Ghosts"" and with this album began to show that the relationship was time well spent."
5,New-wave gives 'way to fin-de-siecle funk on this one.,"Byrne, Weymouth, Franz and Harrison must've decided ""less Fixx more Funkadelics"" on this pivotal CD. ""Speaking In Tongues"" and its companion, the video to the Demme directed ""Stop Making Sense"", in my opinion are peak-form, post-Eno Heads. The album features keyboardists Wally Badarou--on loan from Island Records session work--and Bernie Worrell, who may or may not have been on loan from George Clinton's P-funk camp. Their work is fantabulous, particularly on the multi-tracked, polyrhythmic ""Girlfriend Is Better""--the CD's tour-de-force. ""Swamp"", a growling, slow winding, genetically engineered piece of alterno-funk, finds Bryne playing bluesman. Lady bassist Tina ""Tom-Tom"" Weymouth has always been impressive to me--she helps keep the bottom in tracks like ""Slippery People"" and ""Moon Rocks"" moving! This is another fine CD you can put on and let ride all day long. No track skipping required."
5,Many Good Stories In One,"Mystery, terror, suspense... it's all here. Just look at all the classic stories in this one volume: The Fall of the House of Usher, The Tell-Tell Heart, The Cask of Amontillado, and his masterpiece the Gold Bug. This is required reading for any fan of Poe, or classic writings in general."
2,Terrible,The songs on Live Magic have been heavilly edited. Much better versions can be found on Live At Wembley the album to get instead of this one.
1,Not bad... even worse,"this is the worst live album Queen ever released, believe meI love Queen but this album was a total disappointment... cuts, bad performances (Bohemian rhapsody is a disaster), bad recording quality...buy Live at Wembley, THAT is a GREAT live album, this is just crap"
2,Dead Magic,"Queen's 1986 Magic Tour was a great show, but after listening to this disc, one wonders whether the visuals were the reason the show was worthwhile. I've listened to this album about three times, the second and third listens were because I felt I didn't give the disc enough of a chance. I'm a huge Queen fan, but listening to this album in its entirety is a challenge. Freddie's vocals are second-rate, and most of the songs are edited (which may actually be a good thing).Queen were a great live band, as proved by the 1979 Live Killers, but Live Magic is a pretty poor album."
1,Horrible!,"This is the perfect example of how not to release a live album. Virtually all of the tracks have been edited (better word, massacred.) Why it was put out this way is unknown, other than to fit on a single disc.This should have been Queen's Knebworth Park show, as it was their last ever performance.Another question that begs to be asked is why, 10 years after it was originally released in Europe, Hollywood Records put it out here? It makes no sense as a proper double album from this tour (""Live at Wembley 86"") was released a few years before. To make money perhaps? Nah, would a record company ever be driven by profits?Unless you are a Queen completist, avoid this one."
3,Not Queen's Best,"When I bought this CD, I was surprised how cut up the songs where. I am a huge fan of Queen, so I'm going to keep this CD, but I would not recommend it to anyone. The only three comlete songs are A Kind of Magic, Another One Bites the Dust, and Hammer to Fall. The other 12 songs are murdered severely."
2,Do not buy this cd,"DON'T BUY THIS CD, It cuts off a lot of Bohemian Rhapsody, most of We Will Rock You, and the last part of We are the Champions. This CD is a rip-off. If you want a good CD buy the greatest hits."
3,Good,"This album is good. These songs are fine but they don't really perform them so good. Here is no jamming, and they make these songs shorter, than they are in studio, originally recorded. Queen is a wonderful band, but this concert is really not the best. If you are a Queen fan, I recommend for you."
3,Not as good as expected,"Let me say first off that this is not a bad album it's just not as good as I was hoping for from the Melbourne trio. Although the two singles so far released, Cigarettes & Suitcases and Oh Kamikaze are both good songs they are certainly not as catchy as Monsters or Deja Vu. Likewise the rest of the album isn't nearly as easy to listen to as Official Fiction. All in all worth getting if your a fan of the band but if your just starting out on SFK I'd recommend Echolalia or Official Fiction instead."
4,hifty takes his act to Italy.,"A delightful romp for Shifty in his beloved Italy. Surrounded by his favorite things, fast horses, flashy women, and fine food, Shifty finds himself once again unable to walk away from trouble. He meets up with a enchanting series of characters; a wealthy magaician ""wannabe"", a struggling American model, an elfish ""papparazza"", a self-centered playboy of enormous wealth and power, as well as a sly and crafty female district attorney with a very special agenda. Shifty has a chance to turn the tables in a no-limits poker game but soon finds the tables turned on him in one of the best surprise endings in the series to date. Even though Shifty leaves all his cronies at home for this trip you'll find that they're not even missed. Another fine installment in a thoroughly entertaining series."
3,Psychopaths and sleight of hand,"In his ninth adventure, Shifty Lou Anderson, magician, card sharp and horse player, attends a magician's convention in Milan and sticks around for crime solving.When a naive American would-be model is found raped and beaten nearly to death, the list of suspects is small and headed by a playboy psychopath from a very rich, crooked and protected family. But the Italian police seem determined to pin the crime on a pair of car thieves. Shifty, hired by the girl's father, does some investigating of his own with the help of an independent, eccentric and sexy Italian photographer.While the plot does not move at lightning speed and some readers may anticipate the resolution, Shifty is an entertaining and crafty protagonist and the Italian setting is well realized ? especially the food."
1,Awful,"Simply awful. What can I say to explain this statement? Perhaps the following list may give you an idea: a disastrous plot that is so transparent my 5 year old could have seen the end coming, tired and jaded characters that are about as lifelike as a statue, occassional lapses in grammar, etc etcIf you have the time to read a book, I would humbly suggest trying some other title."
2,not enough maps,"Interesting book, some neat pictures and drawings, cowboy slang scattered through-out, a few maps.Dry reading.My biggest complaint is there are no maps of the main areas or landmarks discussed, such as the Indian reservations, mesas, mines, towns, mountain ranges, etc.What use is it to say ""the mailtrain went from here to there"" when one has no idea via a map or anything else where here or there is.I'm very partial to maps, which is the reason for low stars."
5,Amazing,"If you are looking at this CD you have obviously heard Evangel (the main MC in Christcentric) spit on a mixtape or someone else's cd. I first heard the dude on Phanatik's cd, he laid out an incredible verse.His verses on this cd are of the same caliber. Everytime Evangel grabs the mic it's like the Lord is working straight through him. If you love hearing the word in raps than get this cd. You will be blessed."
3,Bad Guy,"This is probably the most uncomfortable movie experience I have ever had. The first half is so unapologetically brutal (psychologically, that is) yet real, that I nearly walked out. I'm still not sure if I made the right choice by sticking around.This really could've been a good movie. Perhaps even a great one. Acting is mostly spotty, but the two leads more than make up for it with their gritty performances. And while the story is unsettling and uncomfortable, it keeps on drawing you in.Eventually though, the bad outweighed the good. The storytelling is extremely disjointed and arbitrary, and the movie could've been about 30 minutes shorter. This is not an easy film to sit through, and perhaps that alone makes it worth checking out. Just consider yourself warned."
3,bad guy,"sometimes you figured where it was going,others made you like questioned. sometimes a little off the wall. ok but not."
1,Bad Guy is really bad,"Horrible acting, cheesy and poor English translation and a storyline that makes little sense.It's description as an ""Erotic Love Story"" is completely inaccurate. It's sleazy hate story seems to be a better description. Maybe some ""love"" showed up later in the film, but I couldn't finish it. The film did little to grasp my interest and attention. I would not recommend this film to anyone looking for actual eroticism or a love story.I would have given it NO STARS, but one is the minimum in order to post a review.Why did I even pay for that? I should have gone with my instinct on this one."
1,Disliked This Film,"Bad acting, little dialogue. Film sounds better than it really is. Only Asian film I have bought that I will sell fast. I would say...Save your money, this is a dog unless you are 10 years old."
3,Asian Film Noirrrrrr,"How do you make a dark film with meaning? I don't know, but this isn't it. The film presented a look at the world of human traffiking and that was valid. There are evil people like this in the world. The Bad Guy's interest in a ""human package"" didn't sell. To trafik in human lives in today's world is inexcusable. We know better. I gave it three stars b/c it is better to try and fail than not to try at all. We need to know this is real and it happens. The Korean film with the secret agent's girl friend being kidnapped is much better."
3,Bad Guy - DVD,"Happy with what I bought, took a long time to get to me, but I was made aware of this at the start"
2,Disturbing,"This is an intriguing movie that compels the viewer to search for the film's deeping meaning. I am sure that I missed much of that meaning. However, one aspect of it is painful clear. The crux of this movie centers on the premise that seemingly innocent women can be sexually exploited and over time they were come to accept and thrive on that exploitation. I found that premise disturbing and unrealistic. Also, it left me with the fear that women hating men could use that premise to justify their abuse of the opposite sex. If so, this movie could contribute, in a small way, to the perpetuation of the subjugation of women or at least the fantasy thereof.Watch this movie if you must, but be critical of its assumptions about male/female relationships."
1,Erotic love story???,"Very difficult to watch if you are a woman. If you are looking for eroticism, love, or even a story, this is not the flic for you."
2,Bad Guy,"After viewing Spring, Summer,Fall....Winter my expectations of thei movie were disappointing. I'm sure that from an artistic and cultural standpoint this movie succeded in its purpose, but it was not enjoyable to me."
5,Excellent family movie (just kidding),People who actually love each other never have sex in this movie. Guess it comes with the job.
4,Good Information Contained in the Pages of this book,"There is a lot of good information in this book. I always find it's best to have a variety of books, because you can get pointers from each one. Every writer, writes from his/her point of view and his/her experiences."
1,Book Review-not Video,"I read Barbara Emerson's book, which is, in itself, a very informative book. It speaks to alot of interesting and unique issues associated with Reiki. But, being a Reiki Master/Teacher, I do not agree with the sacred process being filmed and used to attune people in the privacy of their own homes without a Master/Teacher presense. The attunement process is very emotional and the connection that takes place during that process is profound. I highly recommend reading her book, and learning all the hand positions/symbols/etc. that she details but I disagree with buying a video to be attuned. That is something you will want to do in person with the Master/Teacher of your choice."
1,Out of date product,"The item I purchased was listed as ""New"". Car seats for infants have an expiration date and can only be used for 5 years. The ""New"" base I purchased was produced in 2003 and has expired, it is now 2010. The seller will not return my e-mails for a return or refund. The money I spent was money wasted and when you have a new baby every penny counts. Don't buy from this seller unless you are 100% positive the item is new and not expired."
3,Infant Seat Base Not a Must-Have,"Just buy a car seat that will grow with your child. The base is only good for the matching car seat which has a maximum of 20 lbs. So in other words, you have to buy a car seat anyway in a few months. Unless you plan on using the matching car seat/carrier for other children (on the way or expecting) put the money towards an actual car seat. The only advantage is that you can use the car seat carrier when you go to supermarkets or retail stores to secure the baby in the shopping cart. But these days many stores have the seats installed in the carts already. Also, I thought it was a little bit more expensive than it should have been considering that you can only use it for a short time..."
5,A true metal classic,"Those of you who had more strict parents might be able to relate to this. When I was about 10 and I was getting into metal for the first time, my parents were paranoid about the messages in metal and wouldn't let me buy other bands that I like (i.e; King Diamond, Motley Crue). But because of Stryer's reputation they allowed me to get this album. And what an album it turned out to be... The whole band is rock solid in every department. The songs are all classics, and there is a passable amount of hard stuff here. Admittedly, I would sometimes fast forward (we didn't have CD players back then) past some of the ballads, but it was worth it. I still bust this tape out from time to time and jam along with it on guitar. One of the best metal albums ever, says I."
4,Awsome Musicians,"Stryper is an awsome band. Ok, Michael Sweet's voice might be a little high, but very few guitarist can match Oz Foxx's guitar playing. They are by far one of the best 80's bands ever, and i would recomend this album to anyone who likes heavy 80's rock(even if you are not christian) and anyone who doesn't like them wouldn't know music if it jumped up and bit'em, are probably communist, and will continue to listen to A-ha, Wham, and N'sync all thier lives."
5,Stryper.... good stuff.,"Come on, admit it.... you remember the old days when MTV actually played music, watching the Stryper videos playing and rocking out to the music.I got the urge to hear some of their classic hits again, so I picked up the first four CDs via Amazon. I fully expected to listen to them now and think, ""Huh, I remember them being so much better than this....""I was wrong. Their original songs still rock as hard today as any other band out there in their sound genre. They didn't go for half the gimicky sound that some of the bands had, they just stuck to a standard rock & roll formula that worked, and it sounds just as great today as it did back then.Well worth the meager price paid for the CDs. ;-)"
4,The Boys Fit Their Time,Stryper didn't lose their message so much as the time just left them behind. They played a simple style of power rock and flowery ballads that were in vogue at the start of the 90's. Michael Sweet is actually much more in touch with his vocal skills on his solo releases since Stryper split up.
1,Worst of the 90's.,"So many amazing bands that are still rocking the world today came from the 80's: Poison, TS, Cinderella, GNR the list goes on. Some of the worst 80's bands are also still around like Stryper. This band has no talent every song sounds like To Hell with the Devil ruined with lame vocals, half riffs and just crap lyrics. Avoid Strpyer if you like good rock/metal music."
1,Just a little too much puff,"I read the review by the person in Las Vegas and it sounds to me like it is an insider writing that. Come on, it is very obvious. We want real reviews, not puffed up advertising for some washed up wanna be rockers. The music is alright, but the medium in which they chose was obviously not God sent. Otherwise, we would still be hearing of Stryper. Now, it is Stryper? Stryper who?"
1,This food kills,"I recently bought this food for my sea monkeys. As soon as I put it in for them to eat they all died within the day. They were doing very well before that. I don't know if this was an individual experience or not but I say why take the risk if you are thinking about getting this food for sea monkeys. It is not a good replacement for sea monkeys as it claims. Maybe it is better suited for only ""The Swarm."""
1,Warning! This food may kill your Swarm or Sea Monkey creatures.,"Having received this food with my Swarm kit, I of course fed them with it, a small amount. Within hours every single Swarm brine shrimp was dying on the bottom of the tank. A quick rescue job saved many, but I don't dare use this food again. I now feed my Swarm creatures with Sea Monkey food, which has caused no problems."
5,Star Trek: Voyager Season 6,Another great season of a show that embraced the true values the Star Trek Universe. The shows are a mix of humor and drama that are great to watch
5,Outstanding!!!!!,A must own for a true Star Trek Voyager fan. The added extra feature as to how special effects are done and talking with the characters is a true bonus feature.
4,Another good Neelix episode? IMPOSSIBRU!!,"Man oh Man! -- this one is a roller coaster of emotions, especially if you've grown attached to the Tuvok character. It's starts out like you'd think Neelix annoying Tuvok, and of course Tuvok is doing everything he can to escape any conversation (wouldn't we all?). But then something rather tragic happens, something worse than death, something pretty heart-breaking. This episode caused me to run through the entire gamut of emotions, and at the end Tuvok has a great callback line to the start of the episode that made me well-up with laughter. Fantastic stuff, another recommended viewing. And Tim Russ continues to impress me with his acting skills, I wish he was in more movies or TV."
4,"Decent Ripoff, But.......","Not original, the concept was lifted from Robert L. Forward's Dragon's Egg, which was an excellent treatment of this subject: High gravity planet with extremely fast rotational period which means the surface population is living at a rate of 1-1.5 days per second on the Voyager. The Voyager was a brightly visible object in their sky day and night that spurred the locals rate of technological advancement.Biggest flaw is that instead of it ""being a while"" until the locals could ""join"" the rest of the galaxy at their time rate, it actually would have been a relatively short period since the planet was experiencing 6-10 years for every hour in the galaxy's ""real time"" which would mean 150 to 200 or so years per day. In a month the inhabitants would have had a civilization older than the Federation's. In a year, there is no telling how far they would have advanced. Of course, we may have found the source of the Q as they advanced that far."
2,Kes is evil for no reason?,"I'm not trying to sound misogynistic, but WOW Kes got chunky...I mean well BECAUSE she was practically anorexic before, it really took me out of the illusion. That's about the only remarkable thing about this episode...It's best if you don't watch it or if it's too late it's best forgotten. The writers basically take a fantastic beloved character like Kes and poo and piss all over her for no reason...what were they thinking? I can see why this is regarded by many as one of the worst Star Trek Episodes ever :\p.s. Ok...I lied a bit the opening scene with Tuvok and Janeway is worth watching."
4,Three Stooges,"This episode focuses on the younger more flailing crewman aboard Voyager, and Janeway's attempt to transform them into model Star Fleet Officers. I think the sole reason this episode got a 4 instead of a 3 from me is directly attributed to the above par cinematography (lots of fresh angles, and the opening sequence one-take from outside to inside the ship) It symbolized the chain of command from TOP to the very BOTTOM, a nice touch.My only problem with this episode is how predictable it was...After I knew each crewman's ""obvious flaw"" and that Janeway was forcing them on an away mission WE ALL KNOW how it's going to end. They'd have a really close call with some space anomaly, they'd all learn to get past their fears, they'd all survive the ordeal, and Janeway would accomplish her goal. I wish the writers had the balls to let one of them die, would have had a much more interesting ending....the Capt. might blame herself, the kids might feel some resentment, and who knows what else."
4,Toby the Targ,"Another very different episode; this time the crew is on shore leave, but Seven and Tuvok get coerced into fighting in Blood-sport matches. I really liked the vibe of this one: the people, the sets, the other ship, and the guest actors (especially the Hirogen teacher). And finally someone to give Janeway some competition in the eyebrow raising department, none other than the original Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson.Another thing I wanted to note was the fight choreography and execution was impressive, especially for Star Trek standards. I don't know if Jeri Ryan had some martial arts training before (she has played Sonya from Mortal Kombat), but I'm pretty sure that was her in most scenes and she looked skilled.My favorite moment was at 32:45 when Seven discovers who she is fighting...I had a feeling it was going down like that :\"
4,Delicious Sci-Fi Goodness,"Chakotay (shock and awe): ""Dragon's Teeth...""Janeway (sounding like a drunk hobo): ""DRIAGONSs TEEATH ?!?!""that part made me laugh hard for some reason, I didn't know if they were trying to be serious or what...The episode involves some awesome warship battle scenes as well as some impressive CGI work. It's high on the Sci-Fi and low on the filler and drama which equates to a winner for me. Janeway also breaks the prime directive about 3 times in less than a day, but she probably still thinks she hasn't broken it once :|*SPOILERS* The aliens were nice at first to Voyager crew, guess what happens next? You guessed it, they try and screw over Voyager and kill all it's crew :D"
4,Family Re-integration,"""Its gawt meh by da hayurr""- Captain JanewayTake notes kids THAT is acting.Aside from moments like that and the one's with Tom and Harry, this was one of the more moving and thoughtful episodes. It's a shame the side plots with the station traffic on Voyager were so uninteresting and shallow compared to the superb main story with Seven and the rest of the nine. If you were to edit out those dumb moment this would easily be a 5/5 and a classic."
4,very enjoyable Season 6,Season six was great and good star trek lore I loved this season of Star trek Voyager. By this season the characters were very good and you see them really jell very well
4,Great stand alone episode,"This is a MOTW type episode. Only the monster is a bit less literal. Excellent episode about war, history, and humanity."
2,Would be 5 starts but!!!,"I do love this episode of STV and have watched it many times. I was excited to see is was available for download. But the video quality is not DVD quality. There is a part where it gets colored boxes all over the screen and the audio gets allot of static. Its not for long but its annoying enough to where you cant focus on what they are saying. It happens on the download as well as streaming. The quality is nowhere near as good as when I use to watch the show on TV. So great story, but only two stars because of the video quality."
3,"Oh, my captain my captain, how I hate the smell of napalm in the morning!","Kurtz, a white whale and livid energy-rich creatures from another realm off the port bow! Yawn. Every series has a few of these. Well at least this version is only 44 minutes long as opposed to 1000 pages and doesn't suffer from an inordinate amount of repeated words like leviathan and unfathomable."
1,"The worst, SIMPLY the worst","I own and cherish every other season of Voyager, except for this season. I literally found myself bored and nauseated by the writing, the characters, the clichés, and the pointless introduction of the ""Borg Children"" which made no sense dramatically and when the much improved Season 7 rolled around, they quickly jettisoned them. There were 2 great episodes (one being Voyager Conspiracy and Unimatrix Zero) but out of 24, not great odds. Adding to this the horrible return of the beloved Kes, this season they had a different producer at the helm and lack of writer Brannon Braga, and MY GOD does it show."
1,Oh my gosh I hate this episode,"Of all the Voyagers I have watched to date, this is by far the worst. It is so bad, that I considered stabbing myself in the eye to make it stop.The ""poet"" keeps her hostage? B'Ellanah _lets_ herself be hostage? She could have snapped his neck by looking at him.There isn't enough space on the entire web for me to go through all the problems with this episode. It's like they fired the entire writing staff and let the neighbor's kids write for the day.Oh man. I hated this episode. I would rather have watched 10 old Ireland holodeck episodes than this, and I hate those."
3,Not my favorite season but has moments,"I think think may this may be the weakest season of this series. It does have it's moments. It starts with the conclusion to Equinox...another star fleet ship lost in the delta quadrant. It has violated many starfleet rules along the way especially killing beings that they were introduced to for their anti-matter. Equinox is really good. I never even did watch the the two series which spirit folk in the on the hollow deck because I just couldn't get interested in it. Still watch season six but it's not my favorite season, however."
1,very poor,"i ordered this product from THIS vendor on 3/11/2011. Never heard hide nor hair from them about my item. I had sent them an email and they never replied. This is the worse experance i have every had with an online store. needless to say, i'll never shop with them again."
3,The call is coming from INSIDE THE SHIP!,"Empty nebulas, cargo bay campout, Neelix telling ghost stories to cold logical borg children, etc. Just another filler episode.My favorite scene is the replicator replicating the coffee first, followed by the cup."
3,E.T Phone Home,"This episode has one of my favorite Seven lines of ALL TIME:Seven (talking to children): ""Fun will now commence""hahahaha she delivers that line in such an expert manner, like a surgical comedian.Unfortunately between the bratty Borg children and the half-baked resolution here I can't give it more than a 3 star rating. Two of my friends told me to skip the Borg children episode ""Collective"", I can see why now.On a positive note I did much enjoy the Alien design this episode, very sleek and simple. And to anyone that has also played Mass Effect, doesn't it remind you of the Asari race?"
2,Interesting but Unbelievable (SPOILERS),"This episode brings us some new recurring characters for the show and serves as a character episode for Seven. It's an important episode to set up future events, but I can't quite bring myself to buy into the premise. Even if they aren't interested in the children, the idea that the Borg would simply abandon the cube seems absurd. They would at the very least cause it to self destruct to eradicate the virus and prevent ""inferior"" species from accessing their technology. Also, what happened to the cube at the end? Would Captain Janeway really just leave it there when they could probably salvage all sorts of technology from it? Hint: transwarp coil. This is just one of those episodes that really doesn't follow continuity."
5,Classic,"I actually liked this one a lot. It isn't weird, it isn't campy or overly dramatic. You do have to suspend your disbelief obviously since a planet that affects spacetime THAT significantly would have to have a TON of mass, oh and plus this planet is somehow livable. But beyond this, the very thought of Voyager being privy to the rise of a civilization, and even being embedded in their mythos, is fascinating. Just fascinating. THAT'S the kind of sci-fi I like to watch."
3,I think we've seen this episode before...,"*Spoilers*Seven decides to download a hella ton of data into her other, Borg half. In short, it doesn't work out so well. I mean, you'd think she would've learned from the Doctor, who seems to fiddle with his program every other episode :PTo be honest, I didn't think it was the best episode ever. It certainly isn't without drama -- Seven is SERIOUSLY INTENSE here (probably the most intense she's been so far, in fact). But, after the first scene, I was kind of done with it."
2,Could have been much more,"The message in this episode is solid, but it's so disconnected from the rest of the series that it's entirely forgettable, which is a shame considering what it was all about."
4,SNACKS ARE IRRELEVANT!,"finish the STORY! A filler episode before the big bang that is the season finale, standard procedure in Star Trek. Some people might watch this and hate it, but others like me will still find it entertaining enough. Either way it could be skipped if you want to hurry up and get to the season finale, you wouldn't miss much. It's basically Neelix telling a spooky story the Borg kids about why Deck Twelve is off limits."
2,Missed the mark,"It seems people either loved this book or not. I fall into the later category. The premise is fantastic, but the execution is weak. Lebbon's new style of writing tries to mimic Tom Piccirilli and T. M. Wright, but doesn't come anywhere close. What took Lebbon over 300 pages to write should have been a 100 page novella. Yes, there are a few great and original moments, but I think this book should have been in the fantasy section, not horror. It was as scary as an episode of Seinfeld."
4,Moving,"It is though you are transported through June's life in listening to this cd. Her voice is much older, wise. This took me back to listening to June and Johnny as a child with my dad. I thoroughly enjoyed this cd."
4,cute costume,I bought this costume for my daughter to wear in her school play. It was fast shipping and I liked the costume and the price was great. I only wish it came with socks! The stripes on the costume are more of a orange red and the only socks I could find were a true red. But she still looked cute in it!
2,Pales in comparison to Kerry's work with KANSAS!,"I absolutely LOVED Kerry's brilliant songwriting and guitar playing with KANSAS, and I wanted to give this release the benefit of the doubt when listening to it twice. In short, this music is a far cry from the masterpieces and brilliant playing found on great 'albums' (CD's and MP3's now) like 'Leftoverture' and 'Point Of Know Return'. Listening to those MASTERFUL, 'tour de force' compositions, then going to 'Seeds Of Change' was a HUGE step-down in song quality and musicianship. It's like going from a Porsche or Ferrari to a Yugo! The songs on this release are quite lame in comparison to those aforementioned monstrous prog-rock opuses. That said, Kerry has a place in history for being in, and 'peaking' with one of the GREATEST rock bands, bar none, period!"
2,Not His Best,"As someone who enjoyed Kansas and Kerry's later Christian efforts in AD I was disappointed in this work. While I was much more conservative in what I considered Christian at that time, I still find it strange that Kerry, at a time when Dio was emphasizing satanically images he would want a brooding Dio singing ""Live For The King."" The pain in his voice in this song makes you wonder who his king is. Down to the Core is a good song but the rest are mediocre at best and below his Kansas/AD standards IMHO."
5,Everything I've tried has come out great!,"This is the first cookbook that every recipe has been fabulous, the first time I try it. The Crab cake sandwiches and the bean and corn salad have become staples around our house. I especially like the menu and season format for the recipes."
1,Not what I was looking for,"I was looking for a book that would bring my husband I closer as a couple to God. Something we could follow to strengthen our relationship with eachother and with God. However, I felt this book was too complicated for just a couple to work on at home. This is more for the instructor in a couples group setting. This would be helpful for a course outline. Not a couple strengthening tool."
2,"good for a few months,then.......","Somewhat worthless to me, I bought it brand new and it lasted 3 months before it started to scratch every dvd you put in it, and the picture starts freezing. My advice, if you do buy it (Buy it new) and dont use it alot otherwise it will start to wear down. Any used purchase your better off flushing your money down the toilet!!!!"
4,Pretty good DVD Player,"If you're looking for a cheap DVD player that can both plug into your TV and be portable, this is the way to go. It has a pretty light charger, the battery is pretty decent, it has clear audio, and it uses a remote control. It has ports for 2 headphones so 2 people can watch and listen. It's pretty small and has a kind of minimalist design."
1,Bright but don't last long,"Definitley enjoyed how much brighter they were while they lasted. First one died after about a week, and the next died the following day...really disappointed. My stock bulbs were 10 years old and still worked fine."
2,Bright but didn't last long,I got the bulbs fast from Amazon and put them in my Sienna fog light position. They were brighter than the OEM. The only problem is that the lights just went out after one month of use and we mainly use the van on weekends !! So right now I'm debating to get another pair or go with another company.
5,I give it 5 STARS!,"I've just completed ""Second Chair"", which has become my NEWEST favorite by William Manchee! I don't know how an author can continue to surpass their work, but Mr. Manchee has done it again! There are so many things going on in this story, all of which FORCE you to read as quickly as you can, so you can find out the ending ......... which of COURSE does NOT disappoint! This author is such an enjoyable story teller, surprising you over and over in each novel. I love courtroom dramas, and ""Second Chair"" has an incredible drama played out in court. No spoilers, but suffice it to say, if you love legal thrillers, you NEED to add this to your ""to read"" list! 5 STARS!"
1,Disappointing,"I am an avid mystery reader and was excited when the book arrived; but I found this story wanting. I was able to follow the story, but re-listening to chapters thinking I had missed something. I had some trouble understanding the motivation of the characters. There were many unanswered questions that tended to make the events unbelievable. I especially had difficulty with the character Snake; he was very unprofessional, and his actions in real life would have gotten him disbarred and probably arrested. The trial was contrived, I thought I was watching a Perry Mason show. The unnecessary filler was confusing, and another reason I re-listened thinking I had missed something. The dialogue was simplistic, so when advanced vocabulary was used it was glaringly out of place. After completing the book I had the feeling Mr Manchee had written 2 short stories and tried weave them into one book."
5,An entertaining and insightful work.,"This book is full of insights into how our relationship with animals and the wilderness are a reflection of man's relationship with his fellow men and the larger world around them. The stories are humorous and sometimes emotional. They weave for us great insight into a man who loves people, animals and nature. Mike's love of dogs and his insight into training them can be a help to anyone who wants to know the best way to treat all living things. He is kind and considerate of both man, animal and nature. I applaud this book and the man who wrote it."
3,"Not a bad movie, but simplifies the story a bit too much","Professional cycling is a very demanding sport, and the hour record is probably the hardest of cycling achievements. Without the help of the peloton and unaffected by the elements, the cyclist must race alone against both the clock and himself.This movie tells the story of Graeme Obree, who rose to fame by breaking this record. But instead of highlighting his superhuman effort, made even harder by his clinical depression, this movie reduces it to an ""ordinary"" Cinderella story.It's fun and heartwarming to watch -- the acting, the cinematography and the soundtrack are quite good.Some parts of the story, like the struggle between Obree and the UCI are wonderfully played, but watching the movie, I kept feeling that something is missing for me: the realization of how amazing Obree's effort was, and what a superman he must be, overcoming his illness and transcending the abilities of the human body, to a record of 52.713km in a hour."
5,wonderful film,"I bought it at Hollywood video they were having a going out of business sale, everything 70% off. I thought it would just be ok, I was wrong it was a great film that's about a lot more then just bike racing. well no need to say more other people have already explained it in full, just watch it, if you've any kind of mind you'll love it."
3,The Flying Scotsman,"This film offers more than your usual come from behind sports victory story. For both cycling fans and others, it delves into an unusual ""against all odds"" true tale of beating personal demons as well as crooked sporting czars."
2,I have to take HOW many?,"After I received this, I saw I have to take at least four tablets a day! Too many."
4,Somewhat like Patricia Cornwell when she was good...,"This book reads like Patricia Cornwell used to write before she got so tangled up in procedure and DRAMATIC personality. I've tried Sarah Lovett before and come away less-than-satisfied, but the Santa Fe setting of her Silvia Strange stories is just too seductive. I'm glad I was tempted back because this is an interesting and complicated book. A little gruesome, but interesting and complicated. The story has an early twist in that the murdered are violent sex offenders and the killer is a vigilante. In addition to following the ins and outs of the stories, we're challenged to examine how we feel about vigilante justice. There are some fairly extraordinary coincidences and some odd character development, but they are really incidental to the overall story."
5,"Read haha, Daddy?",My 2 year old son loves reading his George books. The set seems durable and is a wonderful compliment to the series dvd set as the stories have some common elements.
3,"This is the original, yet you need DosBox for Vista or Win 7","This is the game that I used to play and love it. However, it is not compatible with Window Vista or Windows 7, You can run it using something like DOSBox. You can search for this and download it. There are a few bugs with this game. It freezes up everytime we play it."
1,Wouldn't work.,I received the game and it wouldn't instal on ANY of the computers (Desk or laptop). I don't recommend this at all.
2,Good Luck Getting It to Work,"We also had problems with the game freezing. I don't know much about the systems needed and such, but this did stop working altogether (I'm guessing when we updated Windows). Great game, just a let down when you're all excited to play and it doesn't work."
4,Easy to follow,"This book was great for learning how to fight. I was able to understand the thinking of a great fighter, and to learn some of his escape and block techinques. A must-have if learning to fight for any reason. You never know who will be able to put you on the mat, and this book helped me understand what is needed."
3,Good Reference,"If you are looking for a good reference book for advanced Jiu Jitsu techniques, this is one.However you must know that a book will never replace a real instructor. So go enroll in a real Jiu Jitsu school if you are serious about learning, or as an alternative join Gracie University and train at home if you would like to. But don't try to learn Jiu Jitsu from a book."
2,Not worth the money,Yes shiny and nice at first. ..But Scratched and tacky looking and cracked within a week. Better off with leather case that came with phone
2,broke too easy,At first I thought this was a great Item to spite the fact that it did not really fit my v3r just right. ( I wish that someone would make just a plain clear one with no holes cut out then they would be universal) But Monday night I was getting ready to leave work and pulled my phone out to check the time and it was cracked with a big hole in the corner. I did not bump the phone on anything and I am always careful to not put my keys in the same pocket. It was just all cracked up. I guess I could have bumped it and not have known but it should have lasted at least a month.
5,Top notch,"Yothu Yindicannot be put into the watered-down, new-age inspired ""world music"" category despite the aboriginal background of most band members. There are no synthesizers backing up a few notes on some ""indigenous"" instruments here; ""Tribal Voice"" is not easy listening. Instead, it's hard-hitting, full-throttle rock, with a powerful merger of aboriginal (esp. the didgeridoo) and more conventional instruments. The result is some really fresh and unique music that can't quite be compared to anything else - not even fellow Aussie rockers Midnight Oil, even though their political stance is quite similar. Yothu Yindi has done a great job of skillfully melding traditional sounds with rock and a relevant message."
5,Rock beyond belief!,"No long winded recommendation here. Yothu Yindi rock and deliver their messages with undeniable spirit, joy, elan. Traditional tribal music and then wow! Reggie a little bit, some memories of the guitar from the Ventures, some headbanging tunes, some dance tunes and even a dance mix of Treaty Now. Thank you guys, you are amazing. Here's hoping some day you make it to the US for a tour. Ned Hamson, Cincinnati, Ohio"
2,So-So,"Isn't the best product. Isn't the worst product. It didn't help with fine lines, but it does keep the sky moist. I won't be buying it again."
3,beware of playability,"I could not play this DVD on either of my two USA NTSC region 1 players. The players said ""region error"". So even though the DVD cover says region 0 (plays in all regions), that is not quite true. The vendor did say it plays his USA player, though."
5,Excellent information for all types of fishing.,"Great informative reference for all of my fishing needs, from knot tying to coolers and accessories this book has it all. I would highly recommend this book for anybody that fishes, from expert to novice."
4,Informative,"I actually carry it with me on the kayak in my bag. I realize it is good if you know a few basic knots, but occasionally enjoy pushing myself."
3,Vic Dunaway's Complete Book of Baits Rigs and Tackle,"This is another ""general"" treatise on fishing tackle. I think books such as this and ones such as ""Hook, Line and Sinker"" tend to be of little help to someone interested in a particular type of fishing. Books that attempt to cover all bases in fishing, in my opinion, end up missing the ball altogether. If this author wrote about cars, he'd cover everything from the family mini-van to Indy race cars. No real help to someone looking for specific information on a pick-up truck. Best to stick to narrow subject such as ""fly fishing"" or ""saltwater fishing"", as there is a world of individualized information in each type of fishing."
3,Glad to find this!,"Years ago, living in Detroit, an overnight rock DJ would play ""Hey St. Peter"" from time to time. I finally heard him say the name of the band and bought the vinyl. Needless to say, it was lost over the years.All of the memories came flooding back. This CD has been in my car since it arrived."
5,The band was aptly titled but this is still a great album,I bought this album when it was released and haven't heard it in years but I can still recall several of the great songs in my head. I didn't do drugs in the '70s but I stil listened to the album over and over again. I just loved it and it certainly would make my personal top 100. I should mention that some of my friends absolutely hated this album and wouldn't even let me play it in their presence. We almost wrecked the car wrestling over the tape. Would that make Flash in the Pan a band to die for?
4,Unusual Indeed,"Flash and the Pan mixed the electronica of Kraftwerk, or even The ORB, with the sounds of 80s British Pop/Dance. But they produced this sound a good ten years before it 'went to the mall'. And worht noting is their late 70s/early 80s avant-gaurde sound isn't dated, like say The Psychedellic Furs.Even today, it's still unusual in production, lyrics, and sound, but certainly no longer head-turning.And like a previous reviewer stated; back in the day I didn't think anybody else knew of this group. One of my favorite memories was when a group of us sampled too much canabis in a van parked somewhere around the bottom of Mt. Diablo and just spaced out to the sounds of Lights in the Night."
5,Forever Changed,"I hate to overhype these records, but a few of the songs here changed my life. I mean that. It was 1980 and I was 14, listening to the Rock and Roll Alternative, a radio show George Gimarc had on KZEW in Dallas. I was sprawled out on the hood of my mom's car on a hot summer night, the stars above me blazing. The song ""Lights in the Night"" came on the portable radio we had and it was then I knew music could save your soul. My brother got both records and we played them constantly. ""Walking in the Rain."" ""First and Last."" ""Restless."" A few stinkers, too. But most of this stuff is brilliant. I recently threw a few songs on my iPod and they are still fresh and ahead of any time. Why don't more people know about them? Throw them on the next mix-tape, er, CD you make for a friend."
3,Review of Stolen Away,Not as good as Collin's other Heller books. Too much information. Still enjoyed reading it. Would recommend it to others.
3,The Real Story,"This book though interesting, just seem to go on and on with too many twists and turns. However, it certainly gave you something to think about."
2,Terrible Story,This was a work of fiction based on the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. The story was long and tedious and the characters just were not likeable.
1,Didn't care for it,"I have been reading the Heller series chronologically. In the fourth book, Neon Mirage, he gets married. In the conclusion, he mentions his second wife--I was looking forward to finding out what happened to his first. Instead, this book deals with him as a young cop. The first four books had him in the PI business. This book is so boring, I finally stopped reading it, went to Wikipedia and read about the Lindbergh kidnapping, then skimmed the final chapter of the book. I'm not sure I'll read anymore in the Hellar series--at least I'm taking a break. Found a well-reviewed western titled ""rode"" by Thomas Fox Averil. Hope it's as good as they say."
1,REALLY BAD,"This cookbook is really bad. As a Latvian cook, I can tell the author does not know real Latvian cooking. The best Latvian cookbook with authentic Latvian food is the one by Latvian women from Ontario Canada. The book is called Latvian Cooking. It has had 9 printings, so you know it is good. The Taste of Latvia cookbook has very weird recipes in it for Latvian food. Also it has editorial errors. For example, the recipe for Klingeris starts with "" cups very warm milk"". It does not specify how many cups. The recipe for Alexander cake is to make it in three layers. I have never made or seen one with 3 layers, not even in Latvia. It is always made with 2 layers. Also, the book is missing basic Latvian foods, like braised sauerkraut. Braised sauerkraut is a Latvian staple and no book on Latvian cooking is complete without it. I won't even go into her errors on Latvian history. The author would have been better off writing a cookbook from her own heritage. Latvian is definetly not her heritage."
5,A magnificent compendium of ethnic recipes!,"This in-depth focus on traditional Latvian dishes provides over a hundred easily-followed recipes from pirogi and potato pancakes to Courland Sour Porridge, all adapted for the American kitchen. Black and white photos and cultural insights pepper the book but it's these rarely-found dishes, including one for a traditional caraway-rye bread made with apple cider, which are treasures."
4,more than just a taste of Latvia,"This book is filled with an array of recipes from yesterday and today, a newer Latvia. The pictures give you a taste of how creative and in love with the arts Latvians are. The folk songs are beautiful. As well as the symbols, and stories of yesterdays past. It is a great introduction into a mysterious culture that is very much alive, as well as unknown."
1,Taste of Latvia,"Author Siri Lise Doub has thrown together her book ""Taste of Latvia."" First of all the book was not proofrd nor edited. It shows the appearance of being thrown to gether. The Latvian words are printed correctly in others they are not. The carelesness shows that the author plucked recipes like she did with ""dainas"". I would be reluctant to test her recipes. If Ms Doub is an editor, she should have done a better job than this.I would not give even one star for this book."
1,ugh,needed for ERAU. OLD. Makes for hard reading when all the data and thoughts from the author are from the 80's....
2,Frustrated Customer,the product took over a month to reach me; I'm not sure if it was the holiday season but it put me 5 weeks behind on my online course. Once the book reached me I was extremely satisifed with the condition of the book.
1,Can't get to the point...,"This is currently a required reading for ERAU. The author is very knowledgable; however, he needs a better editor. It is difficult to decipher the author's meaning at times due to his tendencies to ramble."
3,Bueno pero pudo haber estado mejor.,"No puedo decir que es un super disco, tiene algunas rolas buenas, pero está muy aguado, pudo haber sido un buen disco pero fue su tiempo de decadencia. Si eres un buen fan de Stryper, aunque sea el peor disco debes tenerlo, valen la pena algunas rolas."
3,Not the Best Strypr Yet,"I have owned this CD for a numbr of years. I personally think the CD was too mellow for a heavy metal band! There were some songs that rocked my socks off, but for the most part, this album was too ""popish"" for my liking!"
5,5 stars for Stryper!,"Stryper did proove itself again with ""In God we trust"". Excellent tracks of 10 hard rock tunes. Your neck might be sore after you listen to it a couple times in a row. Head bangers get use to it though! There is no profanity in the music which is great for kids that are into the hard rock scene, I saw them back in the late 1980's in a church setting! Although they also played arenas as well!"
2,An album for die hard fans or collectors only,"I have always thought Stryper was a very good band. Not because of their supposed message or beliefs, but because they really are good musicians. I know this album has mostly received bad reviews & a lot of accusations about selling out. The bottom line is IGWT is a lousy album in comparison to their prior & later albums. There are only two songs that come close to rocking. The title track & The Reign. The latter being harder but the former being the better. But neither of them have the feel of their earlier rock tracks. Even the ballads on the album lack the feel of their predecessors. The majority of the songs on IGWT are mid tempo that lack any real luster or direction. The only positive to having this album is if it completes your collection. Otherwise unless you are just a diehard Stryper fan, I would not recommend wasting your money on it."
5,Critics are sinners,This album is awesome! All those critics who gave them bad reports are sinners! SINNERS I TELL YA
2,"Way Overrated, stick with Soldiers or Against the Law!!!","I really dont understand why this album got so many good reviews... dont get me wrong I like Stryper, they are a very talented band and they have a unique style that they can call their own, but the songwriting on IGWT is just not as good as what is found on their other releases. Also there's very little 'Metal' on this album, just a bunch of 'cheesy' power-ballads and a couple of nervous-rockers that lack any feel or power. The Production is very good and the album went gold, riding on the coat-tails of their previous outing ""To Hell with the Devil"". Still, everyone with a brain knows that you cant judge an album on sales figures alone! The theme of the album also seems hypocritical considering the band's then current financial status. Honestly guys (pun intended), where's the beef?"
2,Stryper now sounds like another MTV-friendly pop band.,"After the peak of ""To Hell With the Devil"" Stryper appeared by this stage to have lost its direction. While ""In God We Trust"" has its moments (check out ""Always There For You"" ""Keep the Fire Burning"" and ""The Writings On the Wall"") the album simply lacks the guts, drive and in your face stomp-factor that had become a Stryper trademark. While not a patch on ""To Hell With the Devil"" die-hard Stryper fans will doubtless love this record."
4,Classic Stryper Masterpiece,This was Stryper's final album with their classic yellow and black costumes. Their next album would bring a complete change of both their clothing and their musical styles. In God We Trust is typical of the classic Stryper tunes we all learned to love. This album is a must have for fans.
5,Jesus is the Hard Rock!,"Stryper was/is a metal band for Christians with highly moral and Biblical views in the lyrics. Although not ""preachy"", it is still pretty obvious their meaning. ""Always There For You"" is easily recognizable. One of the few Christian bands to make it into top 40 mainstream rock/metal due to highly versatile guitars(anything from speed metal to pop metal) to versatile vocals(hard rock to beautiful ballads like ""I Believe in You""). Although not included on this album, listen to ""Honestly"" and hear one of the best hard rock ballads/love songs EVER."
5,In God We Trust ~ Stryper,"Essential Stryper!! The vocal harmonies & the driving guitars are the stars of this CD. A hard rocker that you want to crank to ""11""!"
3,Nice,"Going for that Argus feel which is nice. I'd been a fan since coming across Argus by chance in 1994 so I was interested in hearing some contempoary Ash when I bought this in 96 or 97. Fans of AOR would like Mountainside. Tales of the wise is a 10 minute epic (with some nice soloing from Andy), Another time is in the classic WA style of yore, the Ring is nice and Crack of dawn is a dreamy acoustic instrumental ( a bit like Throw down the sword). Very nice indeed. Another album which the line-up recorded is Live in Geneva, also recomended."
3,"Cool album with ""Yes""-like 70's quality made in 1996.","When Ash basically broke up in 1991, orignal member Andy Powell continued the Wishbone Ash name. Here in 1996, Andy (guitar, vocals) teams up with Roger Filgate (guitar, bass), Tony Kishman (vocals), and Mike Sturgis (drums). Released in 1996, this is a late 70's style album, with a Yes-like quality (Filgate - cool bass lines, example Track 9). Kishman is a strong singer (Foreigner/Ambrosia style). Powell adds his great classic Ash guitar stylings. It's a cool album, but not really Wishbone Ash, except track number 12. Wish they'd called it PFK (Powell, Filgate, Kishman). Technically superb, many musical styles incorporated, but songwriting just doesn't rate it 4 stars."
3,O.K. release.,"(1996) ""Illuminations"", brought in American vocalist Tony Kishman (Beatlemania's Paul McCartney), drummer Mike Sturgis and american Roger Filgate on bass and keyboards as they joined Andy Powell. ""Mountainside"", is a classic guitar rave-up, ""No Joke"", with Andy on lead vocals is good, ""Wait Out The Storm"" and ""The Crack Of Dawn"" are also good tracks. 2 years of electronic dance based studio albums ""Psychic Terrorism"" and ""Trance Visionary"", followed, but i never picked those up. 2002 gave us back Wishbone Ash on ""Bona Fide""."
3,An outdated and regular book,"I read this regular book, here in Brazil.I must tell you that this book has many photos and is correct, about this subject.Many of the photos are colored photos.There's some problems on this book.At first, this book is outdated;it was writen in 1970 decade.About destroiers after World War II, this book is weak.Even as an introduction about destroiers, this is an outdated and regular book."
5,voice from GOD,"Anytime George Jones opens his mouth to sing, you hear what emotion sounds like when it speaks. He has no equal in any genre of music, with respects to all who vye. This album, although far from my favorite 'Jones' record, highlights his swooning range and effortless soul connection. What I enjoy most is the variety of songs that, while inclusive of some standards, doesn't just highlight the songs for which George is so widely recognized. My favorite Jones songs are the ones most haven't heard or that are not widely played, like ""It's a Sin"", ""Yes I know Why"", ""Little Bitty Tear"" and ""Give my Love to Rose"". This is an album to be enjoyed in the dark with a drink and inside Jone's voice! Enjoy..."
4,Attractive shoe,"This is a great little shoe for dressy evenings out. It's comfortable and flattering on the feet. Doesn't offer that much support, but who's complaining..."
1,PAl,"i love george thorogood, so i certainly can't bash a concert i haven't even been able to see. the dvd i ordered from newbury_comics arrived in PAL format rather than NTSC rendering it unplayable on my dvd player(s). question the format before purchasing."
2,Ouch! Small print....,"While I do wear reading glasses, they were no match for this font (what is it, 6?). Unfortunate as well. I was only able to get about 3 pages in before I had to give up. I'm intrigued by the content, but will just have to look for a different edition/copy."
4,"""Educational Material""","By Albert C. Bender, Author of ""YOU ARE FOREVER IN TIME.""""Mysticism,"" clearly ampliefied for me, this authors knowledge and intellecton the subject written. It provides information that truly moves to the coreof the subject matter that the author speaks about.It is well written and thought-provoking throughout. I recommend this bookto those who's interest lie within. But, do caution on its validity,when it comes to myth versus reality?"
3,small print,"If you buy this paperback be sure to also get a microscope....The print is incredibly small. My magnifying glass is not powerful enough, and I don't wear corrective lens."
2,Great Book/ Bad edition,"This is a classic text by one of the best modern writers on mysticism. However, the production is shoddy, and the print is so tiny that I couldn't read it. After a few pages and a growing headache, I gave up and found that I could read the text on-line, which was much easier. Read Underhill, but don't buy this edition."
1,I can't read it!,"I've heard it's a great book, and I just received it as a gift, but who on earth can read something printed in an 8 or 9 point font? Even with my glasses, it's impossible! It needs to be a 12 point, minimum! It looks like it's being printed on demand, as the date of printing is in the back. I'm returning it and looking for the same book in a font I can read!"
2,Lack of footnotes and bibliography,"I found this edition unsatisfactory because it does contain the footnotes, bibliography or chapter headings and notes that other editions have. ."
4,I read this book with great interest. . .,"I enjoyed this book, as I typically enjoy political memoirs. I'm glad that Rev. Magruder has found a measure of peace. My suggestion is to read this work along with the memoirs of others involved in Watergate. The shift in perspective was (for me) informative."
3,An exercise in self-justification,"Jeb Stuart Magruder would tell you that he did wrong and is heartily sorry for having offended thee. But his sort-of biography, ""An American Life : One Man's Road to Watergate,"" is nothing more than an attempt to downplay his role in one of our nation's biggest scandals. Like his fellow conspirator, John Dean, Magruder likes to take the ""I know I did wrong, but they did more wrong"" tack. Magruder admits he got sucked into the morass that was Watergate, but his explanations come off as that of a whining child, laying most of the blame on the feet of G. Gordon Liddy and John Mitchell. ""An American Life"" is not entirely a throwaway--like Dean's ""Blind Ambition,"" it provides insight into the thinking of the second-level bureaucrats who tried to further their careers by doing the dirty work. But Nixon's memiors and John Ehrichman's ""Witness to Power"" are much more enlightening and enjoyable to read."
4,No Answer.......,"Good start for ELO, not the best, but I liked it. For the most part, I think they we're trying hard to come up with something more superb and this is what you get in their debut. Pretty premature as far as albums like 'New World Record', or even 'Out Of The Blue', but if you purchase this album, you get it for its obscurity more than anything. You can here a lot of The Move in this album and The Beatles too, all over it and why not, since Jeff Lynne is a die hard fan, good tribute to his genre of great music. I personally like the first song '10538 Overture', I also like Roy Wood's 'Look At Me Now', nice little touch of Eleanor Rigby. I also like 'Mr. Radio' too. The rest I could give or take basically, either way, not a bad debut really."
5,This one is a winner,"I loved this great book. If you don't believe in ogres then tell that to Eddie and be ready for a fight. I love the Bailey School Kids. If you are looking for a great series, try this one."
5,What a Show,"Possibly the best UFC show of all time. With Gracie and Shamrock in the first ever superfight this is a time when the main draw is dominated by character over technique and with a mixture of bulk, power, toughness and overall determination UFC 6 will have you out of your seat from the very start. What perhaps lets the show down for the general viewer is surprisingly the super fight. However for those more experienced viewers this definitely still presents an interesting look at how two opponents change their style the second time they meet. An absolute must buy."
4,great product,"This steamer doesn't look as quaint as the old-fashion bamboo one that it replaced, but it works very well for steaming almost anything. The aluminum is somewhat thin, but because of that it is very efficient and heats up very quickly. It is probably far healthier than the bamboo steamer because it can be put in the dishwasher. Even with meticulous hand washing after every use, the bamboo steamer grew moldy after a period of non-use and had to be disposed of."
4,What a bonus for young book lovers!,"My daughter and I love this book. She is learning her alphabet and understanding the sounds that go with the letters! Each letter of the alphabet has a clever story involving PL Travers delightful characters. It is verbose if your child doesn't love to listen to stories and be challenged by vocabulary, this is not for you. But if yours is like mine...you will both enjoy it!"
5,Darling book,"Darling book: Nice short chapters, with each chapter focusing on one letter of the alphabet, accompanied by a lovely illustration. Perfect for my daughter just starting to explore chapter books and not yet reading herself."
5,Great!!!,I gave this toy to my 8 y/o daughter and she like it very much. Very educational value. Beautiful horse!!!
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"The 1/4"" reflective tape is the perfect width for adding reflectivity to bike helmets. I also used it to pin stripe my bike. It's wide enough to be noticeable but not too wide to make everything ugly. It's quite reflective and is very easy to apply. The tape stretches and bends easily so, as the product description says, it can indeed handle the curves of helmets and bikes very well. I highly recommend this for anyone who commutes by bike or spends much time out at night."
5,"Where's ""Robots for Ronnie""","This could easily have been a 2 disc CD, and it still would not have contained all the tracks I would expect to have seen on a Greatest hits release. I saw them at Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wis. I had listened to them in my time in Del on Philly Prog Rock stations. Hearing the clips here brought back fond memories of bygone days, but the music is timeless. I have seen a good many ""obscure"" bands getting re-released on CD (most notably Gentle Giant). I hope this is a sign of more CTS to come."
5,Still the Best,"I was lucky enough to see these guys in 1979 at a small bar in a college town (Stone Balloon, Newark De), in the front row. I had heard and loved all their music before then but live they BLEW ME AWAY. I totally agree with these other reviews, they were way ahead of their time and even all these years later are still fresh and progressive. If they still play - anywhere, go to see them!"
5,"Great song writing, killer hooks, top ten ""prog"" rock kings.","You could never find the vinyl that all these ""Crack"" tracks are on in a million years. These guys were considered at one time to be the kings of progressive rock (late 70's to early 80's). Never heard on mainstream radio but were very much the rage in east coast college radio during the same time period. The live album got the most airplay as it was a little ""heavier"" (the same songs with less production and more guitars). Look for it to come out next."
5,WE NEED MORE CRACK THE SKY---THIS ISN'T ENOUGH,It's good to see the Crack fans from around the country putting their comments here. I thought i was alone. I am fortunate enough to still live in Maryland and have seen Crack the Sky in concert over 20 times going back to 1978. For those of you not in the Baltimore area the first 4 albums can still be obtained on CD---right now they are only available through Record and Tape traders outlets in the Balt area--each cd contacts 2 albums. One has the first album and White Music-the other has Safty in Numbers and Animal Notes. There is also a live Cd release that has excerpts from a live radio broadcast on Wbab radio in Ny mixed with cuts from Live Sky--if you want any of these CD's --write be and I can pick them up for ya and send them to you. Nothin to hard for a Crack fan. Cya-Billy
4,A Good Retrospective,"A good selection for anyone familiar with the band or just starting out. I was surprised and glad to see so many ""Crack Heads"" reviewing this and their other albums. I was fortunate to see them live twice in Atlanta at The Great Southeast Music Hall in '76 and '78. Their first self titled album is still my personal favorite and I agree that a greatest hits album from this group is incomplete without ""Robots for Ronnie"". Buy this one and then check out their first album."
3,low end eq extreme,"although im glad to see a retrospective, the fact that ""safety in numbers"" has been left out seems to point to inner conflict within the band. palumbo? might consider a little more input from witkowsky? how did attic sell? i bet you would sell more units of ""safety in numbers"", just a guess.....the live record is great!!!"
2,A whole album for two good songs?,"Lady and One Mind One Soul are vintage Stryper. The rest is humdrum at best, mindnumbingly cliche and totally unremarkable at worst. There is no reason to own this unless you have everything else by Stryper and want the two good songs off this album. How can you have the amazing talent on vocals, guitar and drums of Michael and Robert Sweet and Oz Fox and still produce this waste of time and money? Nearly all their other albums were great, especially In God We Trust. This one is a big-time stinker."
1,Anything metal but this,"Stryper suck, go listen to a real band like Poison, Motley Crue, Cinderella or Twisted Sister."
4,"Half of this is average, the other half ROCKS!","The first few songs on ""Against the Law"" are generally average material - they tend to sound very like the songs on ""Pornograffiti"" by Extreme but somehow without working as well - Against the Law and Not That Kind of Guy don't do much and Rock the People is very cheesy and cliched.However the album suddenly wakes up with the mix of frenzied power-chord smashes and weird keyboards on the intro to Shining Star, and thunders into action. Shining Star, Ordinary Man, Lady, and Caught in the Middle are awesome, and the Christian band that taught the world how to rock out acquired a seriously heavy edge right at the end; All For One is an anthem and Rock the Hell Out of You is thrash-metal a la Megadeth; Stryper by this stage were sinking but they went down with all guns (or should we say guitars?) blazing."
4,Rocking for (The?) Rock,"At first I was very disappointed when I heard this album. It seemed that the only good songs (Lady, Shining Star, All for One) I had already heard. There was no clear message. This wouldn't have to be Stryper which made the lyrics. I would say that musically and lyrically this is near Def Leppard - I mean ""Rock of Ages"", ""Pour Some Sugar on Me"" etc. How could this be happen after four great albums? I really was diappointed. However, I decided to listen to this album again and again. And somewhere after 5 listenings the all seems to work. So what if there's not the word ""Jesus"" in every song? There's some great songs that will ""rock the hell out of you"". The title track, Two Time Woman, rock the People, Two Bodies (One Mind One Soul), Caught in the Middle are excellent songs. I'm sure that many Stryper fans will like it if they give it a chance. It's not a classic album but still an excellent album.Stars: All for One, Lady"
3,It's Not Bad. Give It A Chance.,"I am not a long term Stryper fan, so I might not be the best authority on this. Nevertheless, I will do my best. I do feel that their ""To Hell With the Devil"" record had a stronger theme, better music, and a better consistency. But in all honesty, this record is not bad... There are some really worthy elements of ""Against the Law."" The music is good and full of adequate energy; attention is paid to lyrics; they don't hide behind noise, obscenities, or issues that wore thin a long time ago. Some songs like 'Two Bodies,' 'Ordinary Man,' 'Caught In the Middle,' and 'All For One' are quite memorable. And 'Rock the Hell Out of You' reminds us that they are a Christian rock group. I grant that this is not the most essential record, and that their 'To Hell With the Devil' is a better representation of their efforts. But if you decide to give ""Against the Law"" a chance, you may be pleasantly surprised."
5,Absolute best,"This is their absolute best release, harder edged, yet more harmonies. People pointed the finger at Stryper for being more ""mainstream"" yet Amy Grant did the same thing and people thought it was great for her and Michael W. Smith to do. Styper did it with this release, their best and were unfairly criticized for it. The Christian ""feel"" is still there, you just have to listen for it. ""Two Time Woman"" is the best songon this release."
5,they will always rock,stryper was never a hoax. they decided to move on musically and i personally loved it. i think they showed they could hang with the best of them.i truly miss their music.
5,Unique and beautiful designs!,"This book is a collection of cross-stitch samplers in unique and beautiful designs. Since I love anything with a celeistial theme, I was attracted to the full chapter devoted to several attractive and varied designs incoporating sun, moon, stars, and planets. More common categories such as garden and nature include more original work than you will find anywhere else. Many of the samplers have a wonderfully old-fashioned look to them, and the completed projects are finished and photographed beautifully. The book also contains a wide variety of cross-stitch alphabets to assist you with customizing your projects. A wonderful book for serious cross-stitchers who are addicted to samplers!"
5,"Fatal Attractions, Part III","Part III of the Fatal Attractions continue in Uncanny X-Men #304. The comic shows the X-Men hold a funeral for Colossus's sister Illyana. During the funeral, Magneto and the Acolytes appear. Magneto makes an offer for all mutants to go with him to Avalon, a space station hovering the Earth. Colossus, who blames Xavier for his sister's death, turns on the X-Men and joins the Acolytes. This comic really set the tone for the next chapter in the Fatal Attractions X-over. Highly recommended"
1,It was a free book from Macy's but I was charged over $5.00,It was a free book from Macy's but I was charged over $5.00Disappointing as I am a teacher and have a limited budget.
1,Just a toy,"Don't expect to get anywhere close to the 'advertised' light duration times...either via the AC charger or by cranking. Besides having a short duration of light output, the diffuser dimishes the LED considerably, and it will barely illuminte a 5 foot radius. I gave this lanterns 'several tries' to see if the battery needed a couple of cycles to enable it to store and generate power, but it gave me worse output with each attempt."
5,For me it is real nice!,The thing I like the most is the 12v cig. adapter. I can hook it up to a large storage Deep Cell battery and it would give me emer. lighting for way over a week as it is very efficient. It also has the crank power for additional power. One can easily upgrade the 3 AAA Nicad cells in the bottom. One screw and one can easily replace them. There is also an AC adapter.
3,Could have better audio performance,I purchased a Dakota Alert receiver last year which has a very good audio annuciator performance at nearly all volume levels. I've tried two more of the receivers in the past few months and both have good audio performance only at low volume. The sound at higher volumes is poor. There is a need to re-engineer the audio sounder (or annunicator).
2,They don't work.,On my second one and it stopped working again. The first one worked great for a while and when it stopped I exchanged it for a new one. This one worked for a while and now has also fails to detect vehicles that pass in front of it. I have the sensor mounted only 20 feet from the house so it should work fine. Tried moving the sensor and new batteries. Nothing worked.
5,lifeisgood,"My husband owns a used car lot and does minor repairs and clean ups. This device allows him to work in the garage and be alerted to potential customers driving onto the lot. For me, it adds a safety feature when he is out of town as our home and business are located on the same property. The device is worth the money and it was delivered promptly."
4,A very good book on the Robust-T,If you know about Woody Hayes and his Robust-T then this book is a great addition to your coaching library. The book covers all the important points from footwork to blocking and play series from the robust-T. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because all the plays are diagramed up against a 5-2 front. In the blocking section it does cover the even front defenses. Great little book.
5,Finally!,"I have been looking for that remake of the song ""Light of a Clear Blue Morning"" for ages!!!! Dolly is the best female artist in my book, with Reba MeEntire a close second."
1,this is not scientific,this book is a poor get rich scheme for the author. it's not based on any scientific studies and recommends you start using cough syrup as a miracle cure. be very wary of this.
1,overly simplistic,"in this badly written book, you'll only find the obvious and already well known information presented in a very superficial and incomplete way. furthermore, it is very difficult to take it seriously, because it presents psychiatric drugs as terrible and absolute evils, without acknowledging their possible benefits. it portraits doctors as ignorant people that have been manipulated by marketing campaigns and patients as lazy, weak people. i don't like psychiatric drugs, but i found it impossible to give much credit to the incomplete and oversimplistic arguments presented by this book. psychiatric ailments are their treatment are a very complex issue, the authors of this book don't even come close to explaining it."
1,This Book is Dangerous,"I only give this book one star because I could not give it zero stars. This book was used for a class at Michigan State University in 2004. My daughter who has bipolar disorder discontinued taking her meds during the class which resulted in a 5-day psychiatric hospitalization for her. It is shocking that anyone with real knowledge of mental illness would publish such a book. My husband and I visited the professor after our daughter recovered (many months for a full recovery) and told our story. He promised to change his approach and tell future students that if they are taking medication and it's working, don't stop. This made us feel better, but it still troubles me that this book is out there and probably causing other people pain and heartache."
2,A Toxic Book,"This book should be labeled toxic for any one seeking help with a serious mental health issue. In essences it says drugs are bad, your doctor is in a plot with the drug companies to get you on more drugs.Desperate people seek help from their doctors not controversey. Sysoprahnia can lead to time in jail, can be dangereous if not handled , and ruin perfectly good lives. There is no doubt that medications can and do cause side effects ; it seems every durg available has its on set of what could happen. People take these drugs not because they want to spend money, go to the doctor, or seek sympathy. They take their doctors advise because they neede relief. There are no majic pills, but without the pills so many of our population would be dead."
1,this is a fraud,"The author is not even a board certified psychiatrist-forget about being a specialist. His extreme views has earned him severe condemnation from the court of law(has been called a ""he's a fraud or at least approaching that"" by a Judge in 1997)."
1,"Andrea Yates, You Twit","Let me see if I understand the message of this book. Dr. Breggin advocates that all psychiatric medications in this country be stopped. Yes, and we should all walk to Ohio on our next trip. Planes have such side effects.Andrea Yates was taken off her Haldol, a powerful tranquilizer, despite the pleas of her husband not to. Why? The psychiatrist was afraid of the lawsuits Dr. Breggin is generating against his colleagues. Two weeks later, everyone knows the result. This lady is now back on Haldol in prison, for the rest of her life. She requested pictures of her children. She is now a normal person again, with a full realization of what she has done. She will sit and stare at them till the day she dies. That image brings tears to my eyes every time I picture it. Dr. Breggin's cruelty is unspeakable."
5,Great resource,"Dr Breggin does a great job of warning the public of the dangers of using psychiatric medications. He also gives sound advice to those who may be taking these drugs on how and why to get off of them. There may be a very small percentage of people who will benefit from taking prescribed psychiatric medications, but the widespread use of them today is indicative of the decay of our society. Caring people are the best cure for those suffering from depression or other emotional problems. However, caring people are what our society is most lacking."
5,Good information,"I recommend anyone to read this book. I was diagnosed and given medicine, though I was handling emotional stresses well most of the time and needing understanding and encouragement. I agree that medicine may be causing not curing your problems and this certainly should be made clear to patients. Very often in ads and other literature this viewpoint is left out. It is very good that this book has been written."
4,Your Drug May Be Your Problem,"This is an informative, easy to understand book for anyone who is taking psychiatric medication or has a loved one on these meds. This book will tell you what your Psychiatrist most likely did not. It is a very helpful book which tells you not only the dangers associated with these drugs but also the side affects of coming off of the drugs. It gives you the latest research regarding long term drug use and lets you come to your own conclusion as to whether you should withdraw or not. If you decide it is in your best interest to withdraw, tells you how to taper off your meds safely and what to expect during this time. It also has a guideline for therapists. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is even considering taking Anti-depressants, Ritalin, or Anti-Psychotic medication or has started but now want to get off."
4,I think it is a good resource,"Because there are no nurse practitioners in my area, I had no idea how to go about finding a job as a nurse practitioner. This book was a pretty good resource. Yes, you can probably find all of the information on the internet, but at least in the book it is all in one place."
2,"Nice bag, but...","The hemp bag is well constructed and easy to use. The problem I had was that my sprouts (Mung Bean) stayed incredibly small. I am sprouting beans from the same batch in a mason jar and by day two, their size is more than twice that of day seven in the bag. Both batches were rinsed on the same schedule. The jar is harder to drain, but given the difference in the end product, I think it is worth the extra work. I haven't tried the lentils or the peas yet."
1,Book falling apart,Once I started turning the pages the binding simply fell apart as if the book hadn't been opened in ages..
3,"""Stretch"" or ""exercise""","The title of this tape is deceptive. It is more than just a stretching tape, it is definitely an exercise tape, including situps, pushups, bicycles, and other things that might be difficult for a senior to do. I just turned 60 and I found it difficult to do all the reps on most of the exercises, and there were a few that I could not do at all. I would not recommend this tape for an out of shape senior."
4,"Had me yelling at the screen, what are you doing ?","Just watching this whole story unfold had me yelling at the screen, what are you doing ? You have seen this story before in other torture porn flicks like ""Turistas"" and ""Hostel"" but this one is not as cruel nor is it a ""torture porn"". This is a story of two cocky, pretty American young girls who are fearless of any settings or places they find them selves in. Great cast, Amber Heard, Odette Annable, and Karl Urban are the three I recognize from other films, and they make this movie work. The story is tight and kept me going till the end.Well worth your time."
3,It has its moments!,"And Soon The Darkness is a decent thriller. Some parts of the show are not that good, but other scenes make up for it. This show has two really attractive actress's(Amber Heard)Stephanie and (Odette Yustman)Ellie who are the two main characters. Odette Yustmin gives you a couple sexual scenes at the beginning of the movie which may or may not get your attention. (Karl Urban)Michael is another main character in the show which kind of ruins parts of the movie. His acting in this movie is portrayed very unrealistically and is very cheasy. When Odette Yustman's character Ellie is kidnapped the show gets a little boring and has some annoying scenes, but towards the end it starts to get exciting and Amber Heard's character Stephanie ends the movie with a pretty wicked finish. Without her character the show would suck, but she makes it worth watching at least once!"
3,Pretty good filck,"This film was pretty good. suspenseful, exciting and kept me interested throughout. Its about 2 american girls on a bike tour through Argentina. One of the girls disappears and the other girl tries to find her. worth your time"
3,Yea it was OK,Can't say much for it really other than it was Ok some thing to watch on a rainy day or when you've already gone thrrough every other new release
2,THANKS FOR THE GRATUITOUS BIKINI SHOT,"Young women are being kidnapped in Argentina. Amber Heard, who I raved about in Exterminators, was not as impressive in this role, primarily due to poor script. Two American girls venture out on their own to visit the countryside in Argentina. They stay in a small town, where Elle, the floozy of the two causes them to miss their bus. They spend the day sun bathing in bikinis and then have a split up over moralistic differences. Elle is kidnapped and everyone in town seems to be a suspect, or at least by the soundtrack. Karl Urban agrees to help, but she doesn't trust him either. This isn't like the 80's kidnappings where the women were stripped, raped and tortured. No nudity or sex. Some ""R"" language not mentioned on the rating guide. I would fast forward until the girls are in bikinis, that is when the action starts in this slow mover."
3,IS OK LITTLE FLICK.BUT GIRLS WAS A EYE CANDY!!!,"Not a horror film,But Suspenseful in parts. If youre a Victoria Secret model looks like, then you probably shouldnt travel to some remote location in Argentina or anywhere then act like a horny & hussie bitch at the local dive bar, and lay out by a pond in the wild alone, Well then thats what u got & usually end up to. Anyway just as rental worth & viewing once would be enough. nothing special ! B-"
5,One of my personal top 5 for Victoria Holt,"""Lord of the Far Island"" is deffinatly the most suscpencful novel by Victoria Holt. She doesn't give away the ending at all. Just when you think you have the mystery solved, she'll prove you wrong. This is a must read book!"
5,Great Love Story!,"My friend ordered this book for me off of the internet for Christmas. That was one of the best presents she could have gotten me. This book is one of the best love stories she has written, the usual mystery involved is not missing from this book either. Enjoy reading."
4,"An ""up from where we were"" story",Inspiring account of African Americans who loved the game of golf so much. They endured the socially challenging conditions and turned in better than expected results.
4,"Objects, not Relations","With an introduction by the doyen of the field, Otto Kernmberg, the book sails off to a good start. Akhtar is a prolific scholar of personality disorders. This tome is typically lucid and borrows from a deep theoretical background coupled with a rich clinical experience. Yet, it is largely confined to the vantage point of Object Relations theory and, therefore, lacks coverage of recent advances in treatment modailties as diverse as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapies, Gestalt, NLP, and others. Sam Vaknin, author of ""Malignant Self Love - Narcissism Revisited""."
3,Holly Knight's Spider: A Great Band!,"Oddly, ""New Romance"" seemed to receive more airplay two years after its release than it did it 1980, when it squeaked into the Top 40. Spider included songwriter Holly Knight and drummer Anton Fig, a mainstay of Paul Shaffer's Late Night with David Letterman band. The group released a second album, Between the Lines, then reformed as Shanghai in 1982, with guitarist/songwriter Beau Hill replacing Knight. Hill later became a noted record producer; his work with bands like Kix, Ratt, Warrant, and Winger helped define the sound of West Coast heavy metal during the eighties. Knight's ""Change"" and ""Better Be Good to Me,"" both from the second Spider record, were hits for John Waite and Tina Turner, respectively; the Hill-penned ""Talk to Me,"" written for Shanghai's debut, was covered by Fiona in 1985."
3,ONE OF A KIND,"I bought this because I heard the song, ""Isabelle makes love on national monuments"" on an eclectic Canadian radio station. Very funny song but after hearing it several times it just won't leave the brain. But it is entertaining none the least or at least to people that like something completely different."
3,Overproduced... But not bad.,"An interesting production about the disaster operation Market-Garden that the allies launched against the Germans in France, 1944. It seems the director was more concerned about the special effects and the ego of his actors then the basic foundations of the film. Actors like Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Max Schnell all are great, and help the movie sincerly, but god get some spunk back into it! All in all, the movie is very long, overproduced, but has good historical background and acting, but should be re-titled "" A Budget Too Long """
2,Bare-Bones Blu Ray Version,"Beware this Blu-Ray edition. It is simply the movie with none of the extras that are included in the ""Collector's Edition"" DVD. No audio commentary, no documentaries or featurettes."
4,"Worth watching, a convincing film","A host of soon to be Hollywood superstars as well as unforgetable old timers come together in this masterpiece of epic proportions. Capturing an exciting and action packed atmosphere in the first tape that transforms into a powerfully tragic tone in the second, the film itself carries a powerful anti-war message. Fine performances all around."
4,excellent film marred by poor color image quality,"Outstanding war movie dealing with an Allied defeat (compare with ""They Were Expendable) featuring fine cast, story and production values. Perhaps overlong but it is a truly sweeping story. My problem with this particular disk is the washed out color reproduction. Although it seems an MGM product, it has the look of a bootleg. What a pity."
3,Good film but bad picture quality for DVD.,"The film was great as far as historical reference, but the picture quality for DVD users quite bad. For DVD a lot of white dots and it looks as though the film was not remastered first. MGM should have remastered the film taking all the fuzz out first before making it digital. Audio quality-great."
2,POOR TRANSFER OF GOOD MOVIE,"WHILE THIS IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE. THE TRANSFER IS VERY POOR , WITH A TON OF ARTIFACTS. LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE WATCHING IT AT A RUN DOWN THEATRE WITH A 30 YEAR OLD SCREEN. STICK WITH THE VHS VERSION. ALL STAR CAST- GOOD ACTING"
3,"Good Film, Bad DVD","This disc is an example of a relatively good film ruined by bad mastering. The video is the most noticeable example of this fact. There are artifacts galore which pop up in many places, and were noticeable in my first viewing. There is a lot of noise and pixelation throughout which makes it hard to see what is going on, especially the last few scenes where Sean Connery's men are walking through a rainy area. Parts of the film seem to look very dated and should have been remastered instead of being released as is. The audio is lackluster and relatively unremarkable. The movie itself was first-rate. The acting and directing was very well done. The story gives us a grim reminder that, in war, the good guys don't always win. Overall, I think this film would have benefitted immensely from either Criterion Collection treatment or at least a serious effort by MGM to remaster the film."
2,"Great film, bad DVD","A Bridge Too Far has been one of my favorite films for a long time. It was the first more-or-less realistic war movie I saw as a kid and has held its own against more modern movies ever since, giving up its spot at the top of my list only to titles like Saving Private Ryan. That said, I was dissatisfied with the old DVD release, and looked forward to this special edition as a chance to get a better transfer of the film.No such luck. The picture quality vacillates between decent, acceptable, and unforgivably hazy. Some scenes look like a badly compressed JPEG image, and others look as though someone had just breathed on the lens (not a problem in my old VHS release, which still manages to look better than this DVD). The special features are nice, especially the interviews with Richard Attenborough, but then again, I didn't buy A Bridge Too Far for the special features, did I?Still waiting, patiently, for a better transfer."
3,A Bridge Too Far (Blu-Ray),I don't believe the Blu-Ray version is any better than the standard DVD version in terms of clarity and viewing experience. It seems to me that all that was done was to take the standard DVD format and put it in Blu-Ray packaging. Certainly not worth the Blu-Ray price.
4,one of the ten best war movies of the twentieth century,"this movie shows just how good an all star cast can go. It is very long. Yet i find it vivid, moving, exciting. It is surely one of the last of the good old war movies. The film makes itself like the longest day an overrall lenghty adaption of one of world war 2's monumental battles. they both don't get into the horrors of war like Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan. Yet they glamourously display the mode and movement of the battles themselves. This is what keeps this film going besides the fairly decent action sequences and engagements, the strong acting, and/or very well detailed showing of the allied and german commanders striking in the battle. I like The longest day a little more than this but i still like A bridge too far."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"This movie is a very good war movie featuring an all-star cast including Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, and Sean Connery. It takes place a few months after the invasion at Normandy and is about Operation Market Garden, a plan the Allies devised to win the war much quicker. If you like good war movies, than this is probably worth buying."
5,The best World War II movie,"The film tells the story of Operation Market-Garden, and its ultimate failure, the Allied attempt to break through German lines and seize several bridges, with the main objective the bridge over the Lower Rhine (Neder Rijn) River, in the occupied Netherlands during World War II.Very good audio and video quality, great actors and war scenes."
5,Anybody who loved this movie will love the book,"The others reviewers have done a fine job in providing facts about Operation Marketgarden and how they pertain to this film so I'll keep my review short and sweet. For the few dollars this DVD will cost you; it's entertainment value is very high, it has a great cast, a great story, it's based on true events, and it's just a great film. I say order a pizza, gather the kids around the family room and prepare to enjoy a great flick!!"
5,DVD version criticism,"An outstanding war movie and as some have mentioned, better than ""Saving Private Ryan"" for giving an overview of large-scale operations in Europe during WWII. My only criticism lies with Metro Goldwyn Meyer's DVD release of this film. During the early 1980s, this epic debuted on network television, and included both additional footage (particularly a scene of a group of soldiers caught in the street-to-street fighting in Nijmegen) and an hour-long documentary on the ""making of."" Why these were not included in the DVD version (which is practically standard procedure to sell re-releases now days) is beyond me. The ""making of"" was particularly interesting, with interviews with Attenborough, Levine, Redford, Connery and Dutch citizens of Deventer, (the town that stood in for Arnhem in the movie.) The ommission of this footage and documentary seems almost criminal, and the best explanation I can think of is that MGM just didn't try hard enough to track it down."
2,Less than meets the eye,"This movie, which I viewed 25 years ago, does not age well. While the tension between the generals is effectively portrayed, there are too many hokey elements to the actual sets. Perhaps I am wrong and some European reader could correct me, but I find it hard, in the middle of the war, with prior bombing raids, to believe that the streets of the Holland town were immaculately clean. There is too much waiting around in this movie and not enough actual portrayal of action. Too many of the officers trapped in the town escape for me to regard the movie as realistic. And would a British general have gone that far forward--I know the real Sean Connery would have but a real British general?????????"
2,"Defeatist, fascist propaganda",Did Patton make this movie? Because it seems like it was done as a hatchet job against Richard Montgomery and the great people of Great Britain and Ireland. I love how they turned an operation that was 90% successful into a defeat. The anti-British racism in this movie is disgusting. The Germans are portrayed as great heros fighting against all odds stopping Market Garden. Montgomery is portrayed as the blundering fool. Watch this movie if you get WWII mixed up with the American revolutionary war.
3,A Bridge to Far... not far enough,"If you're going to purchase this video be sure to read Cornelius Ryan's book first otherwise you'll be completely lost as to the travesty this battle was... Montgomery was a fool to even make the attempt and the mistakes, precisely and concisely laid out in Ryan's book are not ever made clear in the film... I would have thought that the three hours would bring some clarity but it only confuses the uneducated viewer. So again, don't waste your money unless you purchase the book along with the video and read it first."
4,a bRIDGE tOO fAR,"Quite a gruesome account of a most tragic and disastrous Allied campiagn in Holland during WWII. It appears to be factually quite accurate but was ""Hollywooded"" up to a degree beyond necesssity."
2,A Bridge Too Far- special edition in Japan?,"Great movie, everything that has been said about this movie is here so I won't add anything new. Bad dvd, pretty much a vanilla dvd with a small booklet about the operation and film production.However, in Japan, I've seen a special edition 2-disc dvd for this movie in the shops. Has anyone seen it? I've been thinking of buying it but I would prefer an english edition if it comes out in the near future. Could anyone shed some light here..."
3,"Lots of exciting battle scenes, but much of it is muddled.","A Bridge too Far isn't as effective an anti-war film as, say, Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down, but it is an interesting film in its own right. The actual planning and strategizing is compelling, and Richard Attenborough stages a lot (and I do mean a LOT) of exciting action sequences, but in between these moments, the film almost becomes a mess. The cast is too large to keep track of, the dialogue is a little goofy, and the film never does attain the same chilling violence that SPR and BHD displayed. Still, slightly recommended for war film fans."
5,Fantastic!,"This was one of the best movies about WWII. It is a little ""wordy"" at times but the all-star cast makes up for it. Well worth your time."
5,An exceelent film!,"In the midst of ""Saving Private Ryan"" many people are probably beginning to look at the wealth of films that have been produced about the Second World War. This one has it all: an amazing all star cast, historical accuracy and all of the elements of a truly epic war film. This film really gives people an idea of the history of an important aspect of the Second World War and serves as a good history lesson as well as an entertaining movie to watch. Highly recommended!"
2,Looks and sounds no better than standard DVD,"Great movie, but I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this Blu-ray version. So my rating is not for the movie itself which I would give between 4 and 5 stars. I give it two stars on the technical quality. The video quality was no better than the standard DVD, which I already own, and the audio might even be worse than the standard DVD. All in All a very poor transfer to Blu-ray, do not waste your money on this version."
1,"Great movie, bad DVD","The movie itself is well worth seeing. Very entertaining and pretty historically accurate, but...I bought the DVD at Best Buy and it ""froze"" early into the movie. I exchanged it at Best Buy for another DVD copy and that one froze in almost the same exact spot! Luckily I got my money back.I'm not going to bother trying another copy. I don't know if Best Buy just got a bad batch or if this glitch occurs in most of the DVD copies."
4,Purchase of DVD,The service from Amazon was excellent. We received the item within days. The movie is one of my favorite WWII movies so I think it is very good.
2,"If I have big name stars, I have a great picture...right?",I watched this film as a kid and felt oh wow! I see it as an adult who studies WWII history on a regular basis and felt that the only reason this film made it was because Richard Attenborough packed so many big name stars into his picture. I'd rather read the book.
3,There Are Better War Movies,"My problem with this movie is that it tries to do too much. Operation Market Garden was a fatally flawed plan to end World War II by seizing a series of bridges with paratroops and rushing an armored column over them to attack Germany from an exposed flank. In order to depict this series of events, the attacks on the various bridges, the film is necessarily episodic. There is no unifying theme and no central characters, and is thus more of a documentary than a ""war movie"". Not that it's a bad film: it depicts the events fairly accurately, is well cast and has combat sequences that hold up very well. I'm glad that it is in my DVD library, but, as noted, there are better films."
1,BLU-RAY REVIEW,FOX BLU-RAYS ARE AMONG THE WORST. THIS ONE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. PATTON ON THE OTHER HAND IS EXCELLENT ON BLU-RAY.
2,A WASHOUT TOO CLOSE,"Take a terrific cast, add great cinematography, add realistic battle scenes and what do we have?-A chorus of boos and jeers. Connery seems to be the only personna that the viewer can latch onto, and none too well at that. Redford does a decent sequence, then disappears. Olivier seems totally miscast,and his lumberings down a dirt road under a full sun as a finale typifies the entire movie.It lumbers for 3 solid hours with the Allies and Germans giving ""matchstick man"" perfomances (to borrow a line from the Rock group ""Status Quo"").Annoying scene changes disrupt any flow that the film might have. Also, am I the only movie-goer who found the dialogue too faint and the music too loud? Anyway, the ""good guys"" won while the Germans and the audience finally lost."
2,A poor portrayal.,"This film plays the British Airborne in a very poor light.They were the most Elite soldiers of WWII sent to do a very risky and dangerous job. However, due to American incompetence(the U.S. Airborne couldn't even take the lightly defended bridges that would let British Tanks go through and support the British at Arnhem) the mission was a failure.The troops at Arnhem held out for 3 days against an enemy with tanks, artillery, mortar and the works and still managed to kill more Germans than Germans killed British.But just remember - the 82nd and 101st Airborne are not what they make themselves out to be. My granpa told me this and I believe him and I have no doubt that they caused the failure of Market Garden."
1,Does not work out side of US,"Blu-rays do not have region codes... Or so we thought. I live in Australia and often order Blu-ray from Amazon US and Amazon UK.The resin I get Blu-ray disks is that they are not region coded. This disk, however, is. I have a region '0' Blu-ray player and still it came up with a screen that said you have to have a US player. I have tried it on 4 players and all do the same thing. All of the other Blu-ray disks that I have ordered work with no problems at all. Still... It is a great film, even if I could not watch not watch it on Blu-Ray."
1,Unviewable,NO AREA CODE AVAILABLE AT PURCHASE TIME LIFT YOUR GAME AMAZON!!! PUT AREA CODES ON ITEMS PLEASE. UNVIEWABLE IN AUSTRALIA
4,A Bridge Too Far,"A Bridge Too Far is a classic war movie that illustrates both the arrogance of the British army and the inability of the German army to grasp reality. Caught in the middle were thousands of regular America and British troops who paid the dear price.This movie is reasonably well-acted, though at times many of the characters appear to be going through the motions. The true drama comes out in the end when the British finally realize the futility of their operation. There are many fine performances, namely Sean Connery and Dirk Bogaard. Gene Hackman is most unfortunately miscast as a Polish officer, but aside from this, most play their roles admirably.Operation Market Garden's failure falls squarely on one person not portrayed in the film, Bernard Montgomery, an idiot of Herculean proportions. While the subsequent failure of the mission did not greatly impact the war's outcome, the horrific waste of lives could have easily been avoided."
4,Good Classic Movie,The title says it all. Acting was good and good battle sceens. I would recommand this for any WW 2 movie collection.
4,Great Cast But Occasionally Hard to Follow,"I have not read the book and watched the movie without any other preparation. The results was an interesting big scale movie with a cast of well-know names but sometimes hard to follow. There may have been simply too much to try and communicate from the book but the results sometimes left me confused as to who was doing what to whom.Individual scenes could be touching and powerful as one would expect from such a stellar roster of stars but the overall effect left something to be desired. My wife is very interested in WW II and has read much on the various battles and even she said she was confused sometime by the movie.I think we're both glad we watched it but will not be seeking it out again anytime soon. I would suggest reading the book first, or at least renting the movie before you buy so you can see what you think."
4,3.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An impressive and technically-proficient retelling of Operation Market Garden with a star-studded cast and some enthralling battle scenes, A Bridge Too Far is a must for fans of war films or World War II in general."
4,Good Movie,"Have this on DVD, but wanted to see if it was better on Blu-Ray, it is. Excellent picture and sound."
3,20 minutes missing,I love this movie but there are 20 minutes missing from the Amazon Instant Video. If they would fix this it would be a 5 star.
5,Classic work about people subjugated under Islam,"I think Andrew Bostom's review should have convinced you to read this book, and you should also read Dr. Bostom's The Legacy of Jihad, an in-depth, well-researched, scholarly tome, my favorite book on the subject.Bat Ye'or is a formidable historian, and her book describes in detail what is basically hell on earth---the painful consequences of letting Muslims subjugate one's culture by foolishly ignoring ALL manifestations of jihad, which include not only armed warfare, but also demographic warfare (Muslims multiplying faster than infidels) and Da'wa (deceiving and confusing infidels by claiming that Islam is a religion of peace, etc.).Don't fall victim to Muslim Da'wa---be an informed infidel. Read this book, as well asEurabiaThe Legacy of JihadThe Politically Incorrect Guide to IslamWhy I Am Not MuslimThe alternative to successfully resisting Islam is not pleasant (to put it mildly), as you will learn from reading this excellent book."
2,Three years to release this??,"Klangsystem was a really cool albul. It was. And it seems even better when you listen to this utterly boring and outdated second coming by the trio. Marschmellows spent three years just releasing a couple of remixes and their second album was awaited with certain degree of anticipation. Total fiasco, the music is shallow, repetitive, and boring to the extent that I was wishing for one song to finish just to see if the next one had some kind of redeeming effect. But to no avail. I guess the long hiatus wasn't due to the trio exploring and delving into unknown territories seeking to deliver a truly original piece, but simply the result of lack of ideas and inspiration."
5,Very Strategic in its Suggestions,"Loved this book and refer lots of my colleagues to it. McGhee identifies about a dozen key ""a-ha"" breakthroughs in her work helping others manage their workloads. Then she organizes the book to make them clear, effective, and mutually reinforcing (e.g. after your goal setting, set up your files, your email folders, your work folders, etc. etc. along those lines. It's incredible how such reinforcement helps get you to integrate it into your life)."
4,Good Approach - Practical Application plus Product How-To,"I applaud Microsoft Press for the writing approach used which is the first I have seen in their how-to books. Use a productivity consultant and show how to use Outlook to address time and task management... In one week, I have definately benefitted to the best possible outcome with the off-the-shelf Outlook 2003 product. As the other posts read, the Tasks in Outlook do not let each tie to the other, or link, which is hard to keep your high level objectives tied to the individual sub projects or tasks that complete the overall objectives. This is a vitally needed improvement from Microsoft. That said, this book has allowed a traditionally unorganized person with 1500 emails in their in-bin to one who feels in control of their tasks with a comfortable work-flow, and an empty in-bin at the end of each day. I hope Microsoft increases the use of practical consultants, or best practices when writing their application how-to books."
4,Excellent Tips for Improving Time Management,"I learned a ton of information. She starts with arranging your life and gets the ideas into your head. She works through the way to make your information in Outlook sync with your style, and when to ask for more time or ask for a break. I got a lot of information that I am implementing from this book."
5,Life changing,"Amazon tells me I bought this in October 2004. Paradoxically, it doesn't seem like I've been using McGhee's system that long and at the same time it seems like I've been using it for years and years. It's very natural, simple, and easy to do. I have a windows mobile device and this system is perfect for it.It does seem like it was derived from Allen's Getting Things Done book, but McGhee ports the idea to use in Outlook, without the need for another application."
4,Take Back Your Life,"Take Back Your Life is a great book providing real tools to help you become organized in Microsoft Outlook. Now, my inbox is always clear because I do something with incoming emails right away. If I cannot answer or delete an email in two minutes I move it into Task folder. All my tasks are in one folder so I do not have to search through my inbox for an email requesting an action from me. The book gives directions to manage your email on many levels. Great!"
5,This book is worth the financial and time investment!,"Great Book!You learn organization systems & processes in addition to learning to use Outlook.The book was very well layed out - logical steps from A to Z. I have been able to read and implement processes from this book over about a ten-day period.The author does a good job of providing suggestions of what to do with all your existing ""stuff"" as you need to start somewhere.I found the author's method of repeating information to be useful - it was done thoughtfully.I just can't say enough good things about this book. You should definitely read it!"
2,Get Getting Things Done Instead,"An uncredited rip-off of Getting Things Done, almost to the letter. In addition, it's clearly not updated in any way for Outlook 2003 (where search folders make the notion of emptying your inbox obsolete.)"
3,"pretty good, not as interesting as i had hoped","purchased this for my granddaughter.it is ok, but not so good.she is 9."
1,Not as advertised,"This is an adult sized costume not a childs costume. Beware even though it says ""small"" it isn't for kids."
4,Good,The book was in good condition. But the one I got wasn't the one that was pictured but a later model. My teacher said it was fine so I kept it.
4,Health A Whey is only pure whey for sale around?,"aloha i 've been using Jensen's Whey occationally for 12 years now, its the only 'natural' dry whey powder from natural? cheese making i've found, hopping is from raw cows milk that drips off whey from making cheese. It has a cheesy taste i love. I wonder if its a bi-product from raw organic cows milk cheese making system? which we did at home hanging milk to age, ferment & drip off fresh whey?"
3,Product expires soon,"I simply cannot find this product in any local stores any longer so I was pleased to find it on Amazon. I ordered and received this product in August, 2010. All three tubes were labeled to expire in October, 2010. It seems to me this is way too soon. I'm not happy about that. I have to wonder if the supplier is just dumping soon-to-expire product on those who order online and can't read the label and choose products with a distant expiration date."
3,"People, jobs, romance, ethics -- stir well and enjoy","It's a made-in-Australia drama --comedy, I suppose-- set in the 1960s when jobs were being shipped overseas (sound familiar?). Take a small business owned by an old man who cherishes his employees but has forgotten how to make a profit, add an outside expert and romance among workers, and you have a film that's enjoyable but in little danger of becoming a classic. I like the story and much of the acting, but my wife and I wished for subtitles. NOTE: At the moment, this movie is available in more than one aspect ratio, so check the details."
1,Anthony Hopkins should be ashamed,I ordered based on the acting of Anthony Hopkins. This was a bad decision. Not worth the time to view or money.
1,Unlucky Me,"Generally, I prefer to read reviews rather than to write them. But in this case, I am annoyed and frustrated because the barn came without the tiny crucial piece and I can't assemble the barn for my daughter. What a sheer disappointment. Since this was an Xmas gift, the gift was purchased way in advance of the 30-day return policy and now I'm stuck with these large bulky pieces that I can't put together. Worst of all, customer service at Reeves International are completely useless - they claim not to have a parts department and asked me to search out the merchant to make the claim. If I had purchased this from a store, returns would be simple...because I purchased off an online merchant (merchant is great, BTW), I'm pretty much out of options here. Maybe I can support the barn with a pair of chopsticks or something. Plus, you need an electric screwdriver to put this together.So when you get the product, make sure all of the pieces are together or else you'll be out of luck like me. Grrr."
3,"Darling barn, mediocre quality....","The parents of two horsey girls, we have assembled five Breyer barns over the past few years. Without exception, each barn, however cute, has been poorly machined in one way or another, making assembly a ridiculous chore.Breyer barns wouldn't be considered a fiscal bargain by any measure. For the money and being that assembly is required, we expected the pre-drilled holes to line up (at least most of the time), the number of screws to be adequate and the wood to be a little higher quality.If you are fortunate enough to be a little handy, have the right drill bits, are able to get correctly sized additional screws and possess a lot of patience, in the end these are really neat cute barns. The aesthetic design is A+, the quality, as received (prior to assembly) is a C.In the end, our horsey girls love their barns, they have provided a darling backdrop for countless hours of creative play."
1,Weak,"Weak voices, weak orchestration. A hollow imitation of the live production. I threw it away. Not worth keeping."
5,Effective wound cleansing without the agonizing sting of alcohol,"During a Columbus Day weekend camping trip I whapped the living daylights out of my forehead and nose with my Jeep tailgate. In my first aid kit I had a similar wipe made by Johnson & Johnson and it cleansed the wound beautifully without the stinging, painful agony of an alcohol wipe. I thought the wipes would be readily available in most drug stores or even at the big chain store empire - wrong! Antiseptic solution of the same formulation in a bottle is readily available, but this is not very handy for camping or travel. These wipes are absolutely fabulous, are quite sizeable and have a nice long shelf life of about 5 years. I'm so glad that an Amazon retailer had them - the product itself was about 1/3 the cost of the shipping, but still was a good buy. Every first aid kit should have these wipes in them."
4,Great Photos Of A Great Douglas Machine,"The DC-9 was the first airliner type that I ever flew, it was a great plane then, and it still is today. This book is a photo book of DC-9s of many different operators. The subtitle of the book is ""Airline Markings, Vol. 9"", and that is pretty much what you get. This is a worthwhile series if you have particular interest in the markings on a specific airliner type. The book is scant on narrative, dwelling almost exclusively on color photographs of DC-9s in action. I recommend this book to DC-9 fans with the understanding that it really doesn't cover much information textually, but does have loads of great pictures of the classic Douglas twinjet."
1,2 minutes of practice explained in a 50 minutes video,I am very disappointed with this video. The length of the practice provided in this DVD is less than 2 minutes. In the rest of the 48 minutes he explains how to do the easy movements. Who needs such lengthy explanation. I was expecting to have 50 minutes of practice and the explanations to be provided along the practice. I certainly do not recommend buying this product.
4,The Craving Brain,"Brilliant book once again confirming addiction is nota character defect. Dr Ruden is right on the spot! The concept is not new, it was started by Dr Joan Larsen in the early 80's"
2,A Biotechnical Guide To Why AA Works. Bold? Nah.,"The Craving Brain's """"bold new approach'' to breaking free from addiction is neither bold nor knew. Attend AA, raise your seratonin level so that it biobalances with dopamine and you have a better chance of gaining and retaining sobriety. Great. For those of us who have been unsuccessful in AA and were pining our hopes on this new approach, it's disappointing. Oh, or we could try the eight paths of Bhudda. Geez. Sorry, Dr. Ruden. And to pad your book with more scientific techno speak near the end was also disappointing."
4,Good CD worth getting.,"Charlie have some good CD then some average one, this one is one of their best along with Charlie. This is worthy of your CD collection."
4,I guess the secret's out,"I thought Bat Makumba was my neighborhood's little secret but I guess they're hitting the medium-big time now! The album captures a hot night at the Elbo and makes me wish I were there now. The only thing missing are the great covers that they rip through. Led by Alex's guitars and vocals and Emiliano's drums, I've yet to be disappointed by them. Great song (lyrics too) with the Old Guard of Mangueira putting in a rootsy samba cameo on Morro de Saudade, which compares San Francisco and Rio. It's the only 'straight' samba track, with the rest being a mistura of funky influences. I detect some influences of Lenine and manguebeat, tropicalia, etc."
3,Barris Kustom Techniques of the 50s: Top Chops,"This book is a fair representation of showing someone the basics of top chopping. It shows the initial start and finish of their projects but does not show enough of the steps in between to even begin to learn how to do one yourself. It is a good book, however, as far as the variety of projects they show and showing you what you are about to get yourself into as far as difficulty of a project."
1,Doesn't get to the point - not for the beginner,"I've used Lightwave for a couple of small projects and learnt it a couple of years ago with a good teacher in a Multimedia course.Since then, I've become a little rusty. This book isn't for you if you want to quickly pick up a few points that you've forgotten. For instance, something as easy as a keyboards shortcuts listing is missing (and with Lightwave being such a ""foreign"" GUI when compare to Adobe products, you need them!)This book may be fine for those who have the hang of ii..."
2,Not enough modeling information,"This book gives a nice general overview of lightwave but is lacking modeling information. Unless you're already schooled in these modeling techniques, forget it. If your interested in accurate modeling i.e. architectural or product modeling, this is not the book for you!!!"
2,"Not very well edited, more pulp from New Riders Publishing",The editing of this book is very poor. Lots of mistakes in the tutorials. You can find much better tutorials on-line for free. Save your money.
4,Overall Excellent Lightwave Book With Very Few Flaws!,"This book contains many many tutorials on how to execute the most complicated tasks in LightWave 3D. I quickly picked up on the program even though I had never touched it until I bought this book. My only objection is that there was too much emphasis on movie production instead of more steps on some of the tutorials which could get confusing. However, overall it's an excellent book and I highly recommend it to anyone with a craving for graphics!"
3,Not for the beginner!,"While this book came highly recommended, I am in a class in which we are using both the text and the tutorials, and all are encountering frustration with the tutorials, which contain errors and gaps, or appear to presume prior experience with LightWave. Why can't more tech writers learn from Adobe's ""Classroom in a Book"" series?"
2,A Bit Frustrating,"If you need/want to learn Lightwave quickly, this book may not be the best. The sections that cover planning and profesional issues are excellent. The explanations of software functions are OK, but don't expect to much detail into what each action you perform is doing. The tutorials vary in quality. The first few seem out of place. Most of them are lacking in description, and there are quite a few typographical errors and some missing files on the CD. I spend a lot of time reading manuals and doing tutorials for a number of software packages, and this book has some of the most poorly written and constructed I have ever seen. If you don't mind spending LOTS of extra time trying to work through where the authors (there are actually six of them) and editors totally screwed up, take the plunge. But I don't think this book will be worth the money unless it gets re-edited."
2,Should have been run by an editor first!,"Half the time I'm going through this book, I'm enjoying and learning tons of stuff. However, the tutorials are written in a confusing manner, as the author leaves out steps that, while simple and basic, leave the rest of the tutorial in disarray, unless you figure out what was left out. He leaves out parameters to input, which foul the models, and leave one scratching their heads as to where they went wrong. I'm not saying that this is a bad book. It just needs an editor to go through it a second time and point out some glaring inconsistencies, omitted details and the such. After that, I would add at least two stars to my review."
2,Good for rote learning,"Has good overall how-to-3D information (excellent information on texture mapping). But for those seeking more in-depth how-tos on modeling and layout and *why* certain things work, you won't find it here. Most example are very rote (do this, do this), and all examples use Lightwave's Numerics. Not a complete fault by itself, but this would be a better approach if there had been an example of units, and actual modeling within 3D space. Without this background, the tutorials give little take-away that you can apply to your own work."
5,Chill Out: Scooby Doo,"Chill Out: Scooby Doo is family fun at it's best. Scooby, Shaggy and the gang are supposed to go to Paris, but Scooby and Shaggy end up on the wrong flight and what follows is a laugh out loud and scary good time, but not according to Shaggy and Scooby. This movie features the return of Fan Favorite Del Chillman previously seen in Scooby Doo and The Loch Ness Monster as a Nessy fanatic, who provides some comic relief. Del is equally funny in Chill Out: Scooby Doo. Shaggy, Daphne and Velma provided some of Chill Out: Scooby Doo's best lines. This is a fun movie and it's also one Scooby's Classic movies of all time."
5,Movie,We are big Scooby & gang fans. All my children have watch them since they were little. These were all Christmas gifts.
3,Nice Movie,"This dvd is a nice movie. I bought it for my 3 year old but now that he has a tablet, I had no use for it."
4,"Good Scanner, So-So On OS X","This scanner is a great value for the price. Excellent resolution, fairly quick scans. I have to agree in saying there is quite a bit to install intially, but not that bad overall. Epson scanners I have installed have had nearly the same amount of software. The software seems to lock up every once in a while on my PowerBook G4 1.33 Ghz running Mac OS 10.3.8(if anyone has any tips about that let me know), but runs great on my Windows XP Home SP1 machine. Overall probably the best quality scanner for the money."
1,Any Scanner Better Than This One,"I installed this scanner and had it working maybe a month. Had the scanner kept working I'd be telling you that you would get better clearer scans from something else and also that the software and installation is really out of date.Fortunately I don't have to go into much detail on that because this scanner just quit working for no reason. Something in the scanner itself, tried many computers and the USB port on the scanner is totally dead. The light on the machine does come on though.This scanner is just a waste of your time and money."
4,"Good scanner for the price, with a few minor drawbacks","I purchased this primarily for quick document scans for our office. I've had no issues at all with the scan quality. The scan speed is a little on the slow side but is still tolerable. However, the software (at least for Mac OS X) seems very unpolished. So far I haven't found a way to save some key preferences from session to session. It would save a lot of time if I didn't have to reset the resolution, color depth, and file type every time I relaunched the program.Two minor quibbles:1) The noise is more high-pitched (and annoying) than other scanners I've used.2) By default, the scan is oriented so that the top of the page is on the side opposite the lid hinge. This seems a little counterintuitive.The scanner still does a great job for the price with some tradeoffs in efficiency."
2,NOT AS FUNNY AS BILLED. AND ALMOST NO ACTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I wish that I could write a really long review on this but I really didn't like it. It;s basically the same as project A except with limited action, stupid comedy, and a final fight scene that doesn't dissapoint because IT'S THE ONLY FREAKING ONE. The weird soccer game was pretty enjoyable, and the whole gun thing was very funny, but a major letdown overall."
2,"Oops, wong movie!","To be honest, I haven't seen this film, but the very helpful review below is of the wrong movie! The reviewer below is referring to Dragon Fist, not Dragon Lord. They are two different movies!"
1,"Jackie Chan, what can one say","If you are a Chan fan get this and get 'em all. If you have only seen Jackie in US films, they are poor compared to the Hong Kong productions. If you get hooked, you will want them all. DO IT!"
3,"Uneven, but still entertaining","Dragon Lord is an interesting early directorial attempt by a very young Jackie Chan. It bounces back and forth between some strange sports and an actual story involving friends and girl chasing. Some times it's good, sometimes it drags. For me, the sporting events went on too long, although the bun pyramid race was an interesting depiction of a Chinese custom. I really enjoyed the story on this one, because the friendship between Jackie and his freind ""Cowboy"" was very charming, and I enjoyed their boyish pranks trying to woo a girl away from each other. The bigger plot is similar to ""Drunken Master 2"", with theives plotting to smuggle precious artifacts out of China -- a subject Jackie obviously feels strongly about, since it occurs again in ""Rush Hour"". It has a couple of exciting fights, and lots of athletic clowning which I enjoyed just as much as the fights."
5,"A ""must read"" book about the Swinging Sixties","Because I helped Mim publish this title, I have a slightly biased viewpoint - but no stake in future sales, hence no direct benefit from posting a favourable review.What I can tell you with complete honesty is that out of all the books we have helped bring to market, ""Diary of a Teddy Boy"" has (so far) been the most riveting read.Not only has Mim himself had a colourful life, but he has also interacted with THE characters of 1960s Britain including The Rolling Stones, the Kray Twins, and many many more.And if the B&W; photos at the back of the book capture your imagination, you'll want to check out Mim's extensive '60s photo gallery at www.mimscala.co.uk."
4,Great Chilean hip hop,"This is a really good Spanish-language hip hop album. Makiza came from Chile but unfortunately didn't last all that long. Members went on to form Nemesis (also really good) and vocalist Ana Tijoux went solo - her most recent album as of this writing is pretty enjoyable, though not as good as this release.Sadly ""Aerolineas Makiza"" is well out of print and impossible to find - even in Chile, from what I understand. I don't own a copy of it myself, just mp3s and a scan of the cover art. If anyone out there has a hard copy they want to part with, I'd be interested! Makes me wonder how many copies Sony even ran."
5,As always spectacular,DS9 is the best Trek series ever bar none. What makes it personally and thematically better is that it deal with interpersonal conflicts as well as eventually war. The other shows touched on them but then raced away before truly exposing the ramifications of all the actions performed.
4,Happy with the DVD set,"The DVD set arrived quickly and in great condition. The only thing that disappointed me was the design of the DVD set itself... the way it folds open pulls against the glue on the binding. But, I still plan on buying the other seasons. :-)"
4,Check disk 3 carefully,"I got repeated errors on disk three of the Season 2 set, turnedthe whole set in and got a replacement, and then got the samerepeated errors on disk three again! Either this is a tremendouscoincidence or the producer turned out a bad batch of DVD disks.The others seem fine so far."
3,So-so.,"Deep Space Nine isn't the best of the Star Trek series, and Season Two isn't the best of the Deep Space Nine series. It's better than Season Three, however.)"
2,Episode Sucks,"I often see plot holes and things that bother me that wouldn't happen but this episode tops them all. There is no way the federation would allow one of their officers to be kidnapped from federation space and tried without any consoltation with the federation. Picard would have been in there hours ago rescueing O'brian! I gave it two stars because come on, it's still Star Trek :)"
2,You get what you pay for,"I had never purchased DVDs through Amazon so I thought I would try this. Well folks, you get what you pay for. I received the order fairly quickly (within a few days) and everything looked intact. I opened the package and any glue that held that manufacturer's package was gone so the inside packaging fell apart. I thought, well, I saved money so this is not a big deal. I play the DVDs every morning while exercising so I would like the operation to be as issue-free as possible. I was ok until I tried DVD No. 4 from the set which seemed to have a manufacturing defect in it. To get it to play seemed like an act of Congress and I ended up missing one of the episodes from DVD No. 4 because I finally gave up on it. I know it was not my DVD player because the other disks were fine. All total I saved $7.66 but it seemed like it was not worth the trouble. I will not buy DVDs again through Amazon."
3,"I love Star Trek, but this one kept my hand near the 2x","Sisko is smitten. But isn't she a figment? If you're interested in that, then you'll watch this episode. I'm not going to endorse this one because it doesn't have to do with anything except to show us that Benjamin is lonely. I was on the 2x button some of the episode. so 2.9/5 stars cause it's DS9, but this is just not one of the better episodes. However, it's not too horrible either. Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Story of the Constible,"I liked this episode a lot. We get our first glimpse of Terok Nor back when the Cardassians had it. This story shows how Odo, Kira, and Quark all met 7 years prior to the start of the series. and Quark is shot! It's also a great Sci-fi mystery. 4.4/5 Stars. I recommend it for Star Trek Fans. Keep On Trekkin'!"
4,Equality for the Naked and Submissive,"A female Ferengi doing business? Outrageous! Well, only to those who really care that much about Ferengi. Yes, the Nagus is back, and Quark is right in the middle of it again. Because Deep Space Nine's sub-storyline is the development of the Ferengi (and background thereof), I guess this episode is worth watching if you like Star Trek. Just don't take it too seriously, and you might have a good time. I half-slept through it myself. But I've seen it a bunch. 3.6/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'."
4,These good DS9 episodes lay the groundwork for the great DS9 episodes down the road,"More outright serialized storytelling (especially in the plotlines involving the Bajoran political situation) and the emergence of the Dominion as the prime threat the characters in this series will face in the future make this a nicely involving bunch of episodes. And it certainly doesn't hurt that Paramount, and consequently Amazon and other retailers, have significantly lowered the asking price for this and many other ""Trek"" season box sets. So, if you haven't already, now's the time to take the plunge!"
4,Better than Next Gen's second season,"Aside from such clunkers as ""Melora"" (with the exception of that beautiful flying love scene but will poor Dr. Bashir ever get a romance that doesn't make us wince?), this is TV a cut above the average, from the introduction of the Dominion all the way back to the beginning and the introduction of The Circle and Bajoran intrigues. Kira Nerys shines in such episodes as ""The Collaborator"" and ""Necessary Evil,"" also ""Crossover"" in which the evil Intendant (Kira's mirror-twin) is at her best and sexiest. The standout Bashir episode is ""The Wire,"" which gives Siddig El Fadil (now Alexander Siddig) the chance to flex his acting muscles beyond ""They are the ambassadors of unhappy!""The three-part opener always deserves to be seen back-to-back (like the six-part war arc opener in Season 6), so thank goodness for DVD."
3,"Great beginning and middle, but has a lacking ending","I do like how the Sisko and Brian are on a planet with unique circumstances, and I it was interesting seeing them deal with these stranded colonist. The ending lacks a bit of reason, I think.So the innocent colonist bystanders decided to stay even though they find out that they were forced into their encampment by two people for some crazy social experiment. The episode had a kind of open ending for opinions to form,I think. I just did not like how the episode tried to show how no electronics leads to a ""peaceful"" lifestyle full of death from lack of technology or torture from being put in a a small box for stealing a candle. So what is the point of no advance technology if it still makes for a difficult lifestyle?"
3,"Kill em all, says Cardassian Law","Cardassia show trial vs. Miles O'Brian. This is an OK episode if you haven't seen it before. But if you have, and know about how the Cardassian legal system works, you can move on.. TO THE JEM'HADAR! 3.0/5 stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,The Kai of the Storm,"As a Star Trek fan, I thought this episode of Deep Space Nine was pretty good, but not the best. It's not supposed to be either. It's a tale of Bajor, and, in particular, the fate of the next Kai (Bajor's spiritual leader). Some of it is important to the overall storyarc. It needed something else though. 3.6/5 stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
4,Jazdia in a Towel,"Another Trill episode that's not half bad. It's a good getting to know the Trill initiate program routine. And the station is in danger once again. Other than that, it has no other relevance to a DS9 storyline. 3.8/5 stars. It was entertaining. It was good Star Trek. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
3,"Odo, I am your father.","Star Trek: Deep Space Nine gives us another shape-shifting mystery as Odo and his mentor/father/scientist get to solve it. That's it! The whole premise of the episode. You can save your $ and move on. Now if you like Star Trek, and remember watching the DS9 one's, you'll probably like this one due to James Sloyan's familiar acting. He's best known as Romulan Admiral Jarok (the Defector). But the real Trekkie's will see him as the Grown Alexander Rozhenko. 3.4 Stars for this actor. otherwise, it's not worth it's latinum. ~Keep On Trekkin!"
4,Season Two of DS9(seeds of the Dominion),"With the final season of TNG over shadowing,as well as the upcoming Voyager series in the wings ,DS9 was trying to find it's footing in the second season.Besides character development,we see the seeds of events begin to evolve,including the rise (and eventual downfalls) of Kai Winn & Gul Dukat,the re-introduction of The Original Series ""Mirror,Mirror"" Universe,as well as the dreaded Dominion.The standout episodes includes Cardassians,Whispers,Blood Oath,The Maquis,The Wire,and The Collaborator.Season two ends with the ominous The Jem'hadar,preparing us for a direction never seen in Star Trek"
5,Elim and the Obsidian Order,"More Ruthless than the Nazi's, More feared than the Tal Shiar, more secrets than the CIA, it's the Obsidian Order! The producers, writers, crew, and cast of Deep Space Nine give us another gem of an episode. Hats off to the acting of Andrew J. Robinson, whom plays Garak. This episode is critical to his characters' story arc. Pretty great considering that he was only hired to be on the first episode, and there was no intention of continuing his character. But the actor was so good, the fans demanded more. I'm so glad. 4.6/5 stars On the Trek-O-Meter. ~Keep On Trekkin'!"
4,DS9 comes into its own,"Conventional wisdom is that DS9 started hitting its stride in the 3rd season, when the Dominion arc really got going. I would beg to differ - while the series would continue to get better throughout its run, the 2nd season was excellent and comfortable matches in quality TNG's best.The first 18 episodes are somewhat erratic - you get some classics like the ""Homecoming/The Circle/The Siege"" opener, ""Necessary Evil"" and ""Whispers""; some high quality semi-filler like ""Cardassians"", ""Invasive Procedures"", ""Armageddon"" and ""Paradise""; and then dull nonsense like ""Melora"".Then, the last 8 episodes starting with ""Blood Oath"" are an incredibly strong stretch, which really showcases how good the series had become by this point. ""The Jem'Hadar"" launches the Dominion arc, but many of the show's other threads get their start here.Highly recommended."
4,Vender for the Military,"Hey guys i would highly recommend using this vender, he is true to his word and will go the extra mile to help us who are stationed oversea. You know how it is to wait months for something to arrive. This vender will pay at no cost to you faster mailing, getting you your order 3 times as afst as other venders. The DVD set arrived fast, it was what he said it would be but the new DVDs skip in places. I know this is not the fault of the vender. Otherwise i would had given him 5 stars."
1,Star Trek? NOT,"Another loser about nothing. I find it incredible that this series actually ran for seven seasons. This show is about nothing. Has no theme, just another alien species with no plot, no storyline, just a bunch of meaningless random ramblings by writer(s) who must have been smoking too much doobie when they should have been focused on writing Star Trek. This is not Star Trek, this is Star Loser......"
3,Exactly What I Needed,THe product was delivered swiftly and intact. The item matched descirption perfectly and has met my expectations and needs.
5,Barcelona,Every bit as fantastic as I remember it. The music and vocals are dynamic and brilliant. Well worth the money for every Queen fan and those who just love excellent music.
4,Not for everyone,"I wanted this in my collection so I could hear Freddie in the ""opera"" mode along with a truly great soprano whom I admire. I enjoyed it but I know most Freddie casual fans will not. He had a fabulous voice and was a huge talent in many ways. I miss him."
3,Daring but....,"Freddie dueting with an opera diva? You bet and the results are something of a mixed bag.Caballe, while having a beautiful operatic voice, sounds incredibly out of place on the more pop oriented tracks here but on ""Ensueno"", a haunting piece sung entirely in Spanish, it fits perfectly.This album is not what you'd consider ""mainstream"" and there isn't a real ""radio single"" to be found here. Broadway's own golden boy Tim Rice has co-writing credits on a few tracks here but not so you'd notice it of course.This project came about when Freddie stated on Spanish TV how much he admired Caballe...she saw this interview and contacted him. A brave undertaking but one that shouldn't be attempted again."
5,Enjoyable without a doubt,"What a great combination with these two singing together. Freddie really shines doing this kind of music. I'm not into opera but this CD is one I've been listening to over and over. If you a Freddie fan, give it a try. You can't go wrong with the price and I think you'll be pleased."
5,Wow Freddie you are the champion! Montserrat you are incredible!,"When rocking the opera world, it got be Freddie. This is the most heavenly sound CD. Never do a opera and a rock stars sound so perfect together. Freddie and Montserrat are the best match.Bravo!I'm glad I bought this CD."
4,dramatic,"so terribly dramatic in the Freddie Mercury style.. We watched a program on television about his life,, and thought this would be really great"
3,Flattering to deceive?,"Apart from the rendition of ""Barcelona"", it just about passes muster. Still however, as a piece of memorabilia I am happy to have purchased it."
5,The Best Music I've Ever Heard or Ever Will,"This album brings an incredible perfection to our ears, it delights our senses, and satisfies our cravings for real music. It is a shame that this duet just recorded one album, because they could have gone so much further together in the music business. The best songs are Guide Me Home and How Can I Go On (but you have to listen to them in that order, because the second song complements the first one). This is my favorite album of all times."
3,Murray Head,"Don't forget that this is where the 80s pop hit One Night In Bangkok originated. Murray Head was in the musical and sang this song. Yes, it was a song from a musical that actually made radio airplay!! Imagine that!!!"
2,Season One... is it worth it?,"Season One of I Love Lucy has finally made it to a complete box set however, what is up with the price? I just purchased Season Two and Three and paid less for the two combined than what Season One costs. $82.00 for a new set ($74.00 for a ""like new"" set) is way to much considering that Season One was the weakest season of all. You would think that the Studio Heads would want to sell Season One at a more affordable price just to get them off the shelves. I even went as far as adding up all of the individual DVD's, volume by volume of Season One and, if you buy them used, you still come out cheaper than buying the complete set. Therefore, considering that most of the episodes of Season One were not my favorite, I just brought a few of the individual volumes that had some good episodes and left it at that."
1,I am disappointed in the way they are packaged,I agree with the comments made by Brian B. I Love Lucy should be available in box sets like all the other series. I love the show but I am very unhappy that they are not available in box sets.
3,Fairly written,"This new true crime thriller fails to deliver right at the end, when it is neded most. the transition of plea of the accused from not guilty to guilty was entirely skipped over. I also felt the epilogue was very brief. after reading this book over a course of a few days, i certainly would like to know more about the main character at the close of the book. it was an inteesting read though"
3,Interesting and bizarre - could be better.,"Braidhill's book is filled with interesting tidbits about Dana's life and terrible crimes, and it flows fairly well. I learned a lot about police interrogations too! But there are places where it could be better. I noticed LOTS of errors that should have been caught by an editor, but its still pretty good all-in-all. I only gave it 3 stars because its just not a page-turner, although I DID finish it so it couldn't be all that bad! Great for a distraction and to learn about serial killer's BIZARRE minds."
1,not what i had expected.,"thought this book was going to be a real thriller, but the end was a disappointment. it left me hanging with a lot of unsettled issues. i also would like to know when and how it was when she changed her mind from being guilty to innocent. would not recommend this book."
5,UNDERGROUND FLAVA,"ClassicLyrics -- 10/10Production courtesy of my man Buckwild --- 10/10Theme --- 10/10Album cover ---- 10/10Concept ---- 10/10Stand out tracks ---- Why?,Stress,Keep it coming,Extinction agenda &Bring; it on.Overall --- Excellent.Go cop this right now ONE.O.KAKA aka God's gift to the underground."
5,Just as good as debut,this album is the answer to people who said the beats werent chunky enough on the celph titled debut it is what defines hip hop today. Forget the 50 cents the eminems the chingys and check out real dope hip hopFavorite Track: Stress and Bring it on and the whole disc!10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats
5,UnDerGroUND ClAsSiC,"The beats are dark & gritty which gives you a real good underground sound. Pharoahe & Prince Po are at the top of their game. Neither one MC outshines the other they are equally matched throughout the whole LP.The wordplay, flows, and lyricism along should make you consider this in your TOP TEN LIST."
4,BACK TO BASICS,This album is good I like it. They're letting you know there's no room for BS while manifesting the skillz to back it up. TIGHT!!!!!!
4,A comprehensive analysis of this rare opening.,"That I know of, there are but 2 books on the Wilkes Barre. This one and the one by Estrin. This one mentions Estrin's book and picks some good and bad points made by Estrin. Having not read Estrin's book, I don't know but this book will bring surprise and horror to your opponent's faces."
2,"Some accurate detailed history,some hype,not well translated","I have to admit to reading this entire treatise. This book reviews the history of the development of the WWII military aviation technology of Japan. There is much detailed credit and history of this sort recanted. When it comes to the exploits of the Zero, the author appears to go by the hyped up press releases of the Japanese of the time, and the usual reference to the allies attaches adjectives of ""terrified"", and ""horrified"", to the degree that it is obvious and insulting. Frequently, the translation is so course that it reads like a cheap VCR manual, but often it is clear that the writing was just poorly organized and disjointed."
3,Lighting the Way,"The book Zero Fighter is about the hard work it took to build the Type 96 land-based torpedo bomber and the Zero fighter and the impact they made on the world. The book starts off telling the reader how the fighter planes were transported by oxcart from the construction yard to the airfield. This book made me realize the amount of researching and planning that goes into the creation of a plane. This book explains the steps Japan went through to try to take over the Pacific. I've learned things about World War II and some of the things that Japan had gone through to fight the U.S. It was hard to get into some parts of the book but, overall, I think it was a pretty good book. You should get it."
3,Have to agree with the other reviewers,"The first 1/2 of the book is nice, talks about how the concept of the Zero began and the difficulties of the development. And this is penned by the man who designed the Zero from scratch so it's a very relevant and important book to those who are interested in this fighter.However, it's not enough, because the Zero went though a lot of changes during the war, and none of that is talked about, not about the exploits of it during combat. The first half of the brings you up to when the Zero became the front line fighter, however the rest of the book is just a short summary of the Pacific War. If the author had shortened the book by half and titled it ""The development of the Zero fighter from design to fruition"", that would have been a much more accurate title. However, the book is still interesting since we generally don't get to read a lot of books from the other side."
1,Just a Nice Tribute,"I Personally cannot stand George Michael's voice and the claims people make that he sounds closest to Freddie is absurd. The Freddie Mercury Tribute is a great cause.. and this made lots of money. But George Michael, IN MY OPINION, cannot sing."
2,Luckily This Was on Sale,I ordered 3 watches for my neices. The packaging was lacking...the watch was wrapped around a plastic mold and encased in a very thin cardboard box. All three watches had dead batteries.
4,"well made German, American turner","There was no review to help me decide but the reward outweighed the risk. I got this to use with my Lodge cast iron skillet, & I'm glad I bought it. It's light, flexible, sturdy, & it's edge is angled & beveled. I've been using it for over a week, & I'd certainly recommend it. For the price, you're getting a well made utensil. I'm buying another one to have as a spare but I'm positive that this one will last many years. German metal mated with an American wooden handle. Glad to see something well made in USA again."
3,Not as good as some,Rita Weiss is a wildly prolific author and really knows her stuff. This book is a little lacking however. It's too brief to be really comprehensive. The book should either be twice as long or cover half the topics.
5,The Best Work on the Formulation of German Military Doctrine,"In Quest for Decisive Victory, Dr. Citino analyzes the progression of warfare from the age of Napoleon to the opening battles of the Second World War. The study consists of the numerous military leaders in the period looking for methods of winning a decisive victory in Napoleonic style despite the great technological advances of the time. Dr. Citino puts to rest the abundance of myths that have risen about the period, especially the military doctrine of all commanders in the opening stages of the First World War. In the period following the end of World War I, Citino is at his best, providing a tremendous amount of information about the great debate of the ""interwar period,"" and the opening battles of World War II, which proved some analyists to be correct in their debates, and others to look like fools. Overall, Dr. Citino's narrative style makes the work enjoyable to read and easy to understand."
3,great watch,"nice watch, solid, great finished. A little heavy. Digi watch is not linked to analog watch."
4,Sector 600 Titanium,"Good watch. Tough. Right price for everyday use. Multiple time zones and chronograph are outstanding. Only slight negative to watch, when you push background light, the analog seconds hand will tick in place for about three seconds and then resume to sweeping."
1,"If you have anxiety, this product may make it worse","I purchased this product after reading a book about amino acids and mood disorders. From everything I read, I was a perfect fit with 5-HTP and it would be a life-saver. However, I took it for two days and felt hyper, jumpy, and could not sleep at all. So, I stopped taking it and am now wondering if I have some sort of ""atypical"" symptoms that require the exact opposite of this supplement. Just a warning: if you are a generally anxious person and also have symptoms of depression, this product may worsen the anxiety."
2,Might work for some..but not for me,"I researched this product extensively before I purchased it. The delivery was great and on time, as is my usual expereince with Amazon. However, after taking it for about a week, I experienced horrible headaches and had to stop."
1,Items can't get much smaller,"This was a waste of money. The figures and items are so small, I wouldn't give it as a gift as I had intended."
4,nearly 100%,"I love the book, but I thought the dust jacket was included....all else is great. I couldn't ask for a used book in better condition."
2,It is what it says it is!,"It resembles the start up to some of those old 60's/70's ""Psychedelic Movies"". Being used to HD TV, its not as crisp as I would have preferred. There are some ""slides"" that seem out of place... post card pictures of dogs? when everything else is moving swirling shapes. I was looking for something on the line of ""shadow dancers"" only family friendly, this was satisfactory."
4,Unique and Well-crafted,Finely detailed and precision crafted model of a WWII Japanese Cruiser that was converted later in the war to carry hydroplanes. All armament including AA guns faithfully reproduced. The fine detail including the main and rear masts would lead me to rate the skill level closer to level 3 than level 2 but the die casting is so precise that advanced techniques are not required.
5,Love it!,"Bought this to wear for wedding last month....got tons of compliments on it from people that thought it was the real thing. Since I don't like to take my real jewelry when I go out of the country, this will be a great addition to my ""travel"" collection."
3,"Good resource, but more expensive",I have had yo purchase this and another handbook for APA style for school. Two different professors required two different books. Both had basically the same info but this one was a lot more expensive.
1,Another lie,"Brief New Century Handbook with Exercises, with MyCompLab NEW with Pearson eText Student Access Code Card.***NOPE***Needed to read:Brief New Century Handbook *without* Exercises, *without* MyCompLab USED *without* Person eText Student Access Code Card.IT IS A PEICE OF JUNK"
3,More for beginners than the working DJ,"Somewhat entertaining and informative if you are just getting started. If you are already in the business of mixing CDs and want an advanced video, this is not it. It will at best, reinforce what you already know about some basic beat matching and cross fader work. It also covers some basic aspects of dual & table top CD players that could be helpful to the beginner to intermediate."
3,Beginners only!,"If this your first exposure to anything DJing, then its not a bad start. There is some informative material inside, but not ground breaking. For the money its not bad, but maybe a longer and better informative dvd is what you need. After 20mins there is no new info. Not a bad choice for a Beginner, outside of that there is not much to it."
1,An Unimpressive DVD... And It's Short!,"This DVD provides far short of any reasonable expectations. You get very little countryside sights, very little city sights, and very little of the trains (exterior or interior). Just very little. If this is part of a 13-part series, then perhaps the entire series would fit on a single DVD. But then, the content was uninspired, unartful, and generally boring."
3,Huh? Did I miss something?,"I generally like books by Jackie Calhoun. She presents interesting characters in intersting situations. Such is not the case with 'Off Season.'From the description on the back cover, the reader is expecting an exciting love triangle, a little bit of anguish, and a lot of romance. However, these characters lead mundane, gray, boring lives and their romances follow suit. At a minimum, the book kept my attention. I kept turning the page, expecting something exciting to happen, but it never did.This story is like an old black and white film on a rainy Saturday afternoon. It keeps your attention long enough that you don't turn it off, but you won't ""stand around the water cooler"" discussing how good it was either."
3,Something Missing,"This romance features a large cast of characters including Jenny, recovering from the death of her lover, Rita, recovering from the death of her parents, and Pam, recovering from leaving her lover. Two of these women get together but only after the other seduces one of them.Sorting the characters out is, initially, difficult. I couldn't figure out why until I realized that they are, essentially, interchangeable. Beyond that, there isn't much of a story line.Despite the book's shortcomings, I enjoyed the author's writing, and wish she'd try a more difficult plot in one of her future books. I'll try her other books in case this was just a fluke, but I hope she tries to challenge herself. Her locale descriptions are wonderfully drawn - so much so that you'll be hunting for a sweater as fall turns into winter in the book even if you're sitting in 100 degree weather."
2,Dreaming of Jeannie - At Least Some Nice Photos,"While ""Dreaming of Jeannie"" has some beautiful photos and some interesting information, I regret to say that if you are a true fan of the show you will most likely not be pleased. The overall tone from the author about the show is pretty negative. Most fans I know who have read it including myself were left with the obvious impression that he doesn't even like the show and were also left to wonder with that kind of attitude why he bothered writing it? With plenty of negativity but next to nothing good to say about the classic show (not to mention barely one endearing word about fans beloved Barbara Eden), it also left most of us wishing he hadn't written it."
1,Why bother?,"Why in the world would any author write about a subject he/she so detested? That's the real question with this book. I don't get it.The photos are a great addition, as are what little behind-the-scenes trivia exists. There's an awful lot of non-Jeannie ""padding,"" as if the author couldn't find enough to write about the show and just stuck in some ""stuff"" to fill in space- like a whole chapter of an irrelevent real-life death, and the entire end chapter on ""Bewitched,"" of all things!.Worst of all, though, is the entire beginning of the book, with its constant drivel about how terrible the show was. Well, I was there in 1964. I watched the Jeannie shows when they were first-run. It was NOT terrible then, and it's still pretty cute today.So, the question remains: Why in the world would anyone write an entire book that was obviously geared to a show's fans, when he/she couldn't say much nice about it? Sounds pretty ridiculous to me."
3,Never realized Larry Hagman was so weird,"This book really opened my eyes to just what a kook Larry Hagman was. He did some mighty odd things during the filming of this show, and it's amazing none of that strangness ever translated to the show. After reading this book, I have lost a good deal of respect for the man, but still enjoy the show greater."
5,A must-have for any bellybutton fan,"I enthusiastically recommend ""Dreaming.."" The first thing I noticed was the amount of photos, and all the rare photos, especially color pics! The detailed account of all aspects of the show gives it a behind-the-scenes feel and I thought it had an insider's edge, with the comprehensive interviews. I especially liked the attention to the 'controversy' the show brought, especially Barbara Eden's bellybutton being seen on network TV and the censor's editing the ending of the first episode. The episode guide is fantastic! Keep it next to you when watching the reruns!"
4,I LOVE JEANNIE,"This book was really great, if you were a true fan of I dream of Jeannie! It gives you all the information you would ever want to know! A definate must have for a true fan!(* But do note there is some offensive language in it.)"
1,All pink smoke and no substance,"I know ""I Dream of Jeannie"" was little more than a fun, lightweight ball of TV fluff. But couldn't this book be of a little more substance? So much attention paid to the minutiae of the show, yet no real depth. At least the many pictures were fun."
4,Good UST Tire,"I'm running this tire tubeless on the rear of my 2011 Fuel EX 8 on the stock wheel. Used the Bontrager rimstrip and Stan's valve and it airs up with a floor pump. No sealant necessary unless you want puncture protection. Running this on the rear and a Maxxis Ignitor (also UST) on the front seems to be the perfect setup for me and the trail I usually ride.I like the grip it gives in climbing loose dirt, rocks, roots. The sidewall seems to be much stronger (inherently so, due to UST?) than the rear specific WTB Velociraptor I was using. I liked the grip of the Velociraptor but it felt like it had too much squirm on the corners."
3,Handy for emergency use,"These seem to be a good deal and they are compact enough to keep in each car's glove compartment. I keep them there in the event of being stranded somewhere in the cold, or someone in accident to prevent them from going into shock."
4,review of Edward Gorey children's book,I bought this book because a friend very knowledgeable about children's literature recommended it for my two great-nephews (two-and-a-half-year-old twins). My niece was delighted to receive it; read it right away herself; and said the boys enjoyed it.
1,"Parents, beware: Nightmare producer","This book gave me nightmares 30 years ago. My kids brought it home from school recently, and it gave them nightmares, too. It's not that it is overtly bad--in today's violent world, the images seem harmless. But there is something so creepy about the thing coming to get the children, and then doing so, that it seeps into the brain on a level that leads young kids to be terrified. Spare your kids, and yourself, if you want to sleep."
5,THE Smith Rock Guide book,This is the greatest guide book to Smith Rock State Park ever. It has it all. That is all there is to it. This is the perfect guide to the perfect climbing area.
5,They did it RIGHT!!!,"I've been waiting for this set for so long, and I was terrified that it would be some sort of half-assed money grab. And it's NOT!The packaging is good, there's a pamphlet with a couple of short essays about the show and a concise episode guide.I found the extra features, in particular, really interesting. I love the behind-the-scenes stuff, and there's a LOT of it here. The only disappointment was the absence of Matt Frewer. I'm sure he had his reasons for opting out of this, but it would have been nice to have the whole crew in on that round table discussion."
4,Remember it as way ahead of its times,"It's very good to see this coming out. I remember seeingit when it was originly broadcast and thinking ""Wow, thisis really original and not like all the other junk on TV.""Don't remember if I saw all of the episodes.The summary info on Amazon does not tell how many episodesthere were. Does anyone know?"
3,Not as good as I remember,"I remember when ""Max Headroom"" came out in the 80's and I thought that it was one of the coolest shows out there. Flashforward twenty years later, I bought the ""Max Headroom:The Complete Series"" and let me tell you that the show does not hold up. The plots are cheesey and kind of dumb. I have to admit that I am sorry that paid as much as I did and I don't think that it will be staying in my colllection. If you are a fan of the show, I would advised that you try to get free copies of the show and don't waste your money."
1,Where is the original pilot film?,"I have waited long and hard like everyone else for this. I saved decaying Betamax tapes for years and finally found a homemade set complete online ""somewhere"" which was of decent watchable quality. I figured I would lose them when this came around.I think I will keep them. They contain the ORIGINAL pilot film which was reshot for the American series and this long-awaited collection of the ""COMPLETE"" series does not have it. NO mention of it. NOTHING.It has become canonical that the original often unaired pilots be included (Star Trek, Lost In Space and Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea ALL include them) in the ""COMPLETE"" collection of a series.Not here.VERY VERY VERY disappointing.About as disappointing as finding the Tales From The Crypt/The Vault Of Horror DVD contained edited santized versions of 40 year old horror movies which were rated PG to begin with.VERY VERY VERY disappointing."
5,It's about time!,I have been searching for this show for years! Now if CBS would just let go of Cold Case I would be a happy camper.
1,A shame us Americans got a hold of this one!,"Those who gave this series a good rating no doubt have never seen the original British pilot. The US series gutted everything good about the original British pilot; the music(mid urge), set design, the grainy b/w closed circuit shots, the great dialog and acting, only to mention a few. Why do we have to dumb down every good idea for an American audience? At least we have kept our hands off Doctor Who!"
4,Looking for Max Headroom,I haven't seen the DVD. It's not released yet! But it should be! This was the last great TV show. Hope we don't have to wait long.
1,I am not a child of the 80's... without nostalgia this is worthless,I bought this as a Goldbox deal.... it is terrible. Probably the worst purchase I have ever made (and I have made many questionable ones).
2,Dated hogwash. I regret buying this.,"Only after watching the hour long bonus feature on the making of the show did I really get what the makers were trying to do. Yes, it's a grim future, but the evil RIGHT-WING corporations have taken over and the people are addicted to TV. The valiant and popular LEFT-WING reporter Edison Carter is the only one telling the truth about what's going on with the big corporations. The makers spend an hour patting themselves on the back pleased that they predicted the future correctly. What crap. First, let's just say it. An HONEST liberal reporter these days? Not bloody likely. Once I understood the liberal arrogance that people are stupid and can't make their own decisions did I get the meaning of the show. This might be a great teaching tool one day, but as entertainment I can see why it only lasted a few episodes."
3,This DVD contains with Closed-Captioning,I am disappointed Amazon.com did not put out with Closed-Captioning on site for this DVD...Before it's release. I check it out and found this title has closed-captioning.Q: Why bother with this Closed-Captioning information?A: For general people who can hear would not think it is important...But it is important for people who loss their hearing. This special feature helps any degree of hearing loss folks to read what is the person is saying on it's TV screen.
3,Don't Expect HD from This One,"My rating is for the DVD set and not the series. While the presentation case is quite nice with its lenticular graphic, the quality of the DVDs show their age. Perhaps it's the way the series was originally shot, but the discs suffer the same fate as those comprising the Star Trek The Next Generation seasons sets in terms of low def video quality. It is obvious this Max was mastered off of video tape and not film, as virtually every shot borders on blurriness, and one can see the horizontal scan lines quite often. Sometimes, too, characters or objects throw off auras. My guess is that it would probably show better on an old CRT TV. Max Headroom, though, was a breakthrough series that costarred Amanda Pays, who later graced the similarly ahead of its time (also short-lived) the Flash. Did the Max expression, ""20 minutes into the future"" give rise to the later lament, ""That was so 20 minutes ago?"" As Number 2 from the Prisoner might say, ""That would be telling."""
4,Max is as Relevant as Ever,"Even though the technical aspects of Max Headroom appear outdated, (e.g. the satellite navigation) the subject matter is intrinsically indicative of the Twenty-First Century. Advertising and TV rating still rule The Box. This is less so now with social networking; online downloading, and DVR technology but the large corporations that ""rule the world"" still have a great deal of power in controlling what people see and hear. Max Headroom Series sometimes takes itself a little too seriously with a few dud episodes such as ""Academy"" and ""Dream Thieves. The relationship between Theora and Edison is a little artificial as well but, hey, it was 1980s Television right? have not seen more than a few clips from the UK version so I have nothing to compare this show with. Max Headroom was truly one of a kind; I think it is still relevant today."
5,Max Headroom,"I thought this 80's show would never be released! After all, the program mocksTV news gathering. It is by turns dramatic, funny, poignant, did I mentionfunny? All 14 episodes are here. Eminently watchable."
4,Stands up over time,"I love this show, and it is creepy how many trends it seems to have predicted. The clothes and the computers are dated, but it is still fun to watch!"
4,A Diamond in the Rough,"I thought this was a great story line. The acting perhaps was shaky in some areas, detracting somewhat from the power of the story, but not enough for me not to like this - a lot (pardon the pun). I know this follows a predictable plot line of troubled man gives his life to God and obeys Him - and blessings follow, so originality is not a major strength of the film. But who cares? Art should parallel life. There are plenty of witnesses to how God has blessed people for their faithfulness and obedience. It's a story that some of need to keep hearing over and over until it sinks in. The other part of that lesson we need to get, is that the blessings arrive in God's timetable, not our own. I strongly urge you to see this film, but only if we want your day brightened."
2,This Video Made an Incredible Story Seem Boring,"When I purchased this video, I expected it to be an exciting behind the scenes story of UCONN's march to the championship. Instead it was mostly a summary of the NCAA tournament which just so happened to be won by UCONN. The featured play by play announcers were incredibly boring and monotone and made the most exciting moments seem like they were announcing a pre-season game. I was very disappointed with it. The background music and constant overdubbed slow motion playbacks made me feel like I was watching an infomercial. It failed to come close in capturing the real excitement of UCONN's championship. I expected more live footage and less theater."
4,Works well for us!,"We have 4 books for the Little Touch Leap Pad and I find that they and the system fit quite nicely in this organizer. There could be some improvements - more space for individual books and cartriges and a more secure pocket for the cartriges, but it's way better than having all the pieces scattered all over the house!"
4,Little Touch Carrying Case,This tote holds everything you need for your little touch leap pad and more. Great item.
2,Car Sketching,"This video is basically just the artist sketching cars with a few tips about his process. Some good techniques, but not enough technical discussion. I felt that the sketching should have been half the video, then I would have like to see him actually finish some designs. I have a feeling that there is a part 2 video:Techniques of Harald Belker 2: Digital Automotive Renderingthat would be better for someone to go straight to instead of buying this video first. I realize the title is ""Introduction to Car Design and Drawing"", but it's far too basic for anyone."
3,Tom Hits Japan,"I've always been a big fan of Tom Green. I watched his show all the time, and I've seen all his movies. The Subway MonkeyHour follows Tom all around Japan, as he makes an ass out of himself and scares the Japanese. Many of the things he does here are hilarious. Like, for example, the molestation of a mechanical Santa, or laughing at a man when he trips on a set of stairs. There are other moments, however, that are pretty uneventful and wont hold your intention. The thing is, Tom usually doesn't get much of a reaction out of the people in Japan, and seeing the reaction is sometimes the funniest part. Overall, the Subway Monkey Hour is very funny and entertaining, but is not as good a special as you would expect from Tom Green."
4,Several Big Laughs,"You almost feel sorry for the exceptionally polite and respectful Japanese. Tom goes everywhere making a loud public spectacle of himself. He keeps it going so long many of them finally snap and try to push or drag him away. Some moments don't work, and Tom seems to sense it. But the ones that do are fascinating."
3,Functional but cheap,"I would buy these again. These were easy to install but are falling apart bit by bit... But they are cute, pink, shiny, and my daughter loves them."
3,cheaper,I guess I should of not expected much for the price.They falo apart very eeasily. Just play with them andthey fall off. Don't even have to tuck at them.
3,"TEAR EASILY, But are a cute addition to bike.","We purchased two sets of these for our girl's bikes. Glad we did, because they tear easily, but overall a cute, cheap accessory for any girl's bike."
5,Bike Streamers,"They made my little Princess very happy. They fit her bike perfectly.She loves the colors which are pink and silver, her favorite."
2,don't really fit,"they have the bling for a 3 yr old... the ends didn't really fit into the handlebars the way they should... but, for a couple bucks, how can I really complain?"
3,Nothing Special,"These are cute, but they to keep coming out of her handle bars easily. I got another pair at a local retailer cheaper with no shipping that seem to fit better. They also Melted and curled up over the summer when the heat got into the 90's"
4,Nice variety of characters but finishes too fast,"Length:: 0:28 MinsIt's the sketchbook of Ovi Nedelcu, who does character design, visual development and storytelling. This is a 98-page hardcover filled with mainly cartoon style character sketches. There's a nice variety of interesting characters. I wish there could be more, given that the book is rather thin.You can check out more of his work on his website.(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)"
3,aj's view,"This product is ok for styro foam,but not for pink board insulation. Takes to long to cut."
1,Wouldnt buy.,"The hot knife cutter is very flimsy. The wire cutte is very thin and bends alot. The heating element was intermittent, sometimes heated, sometimes it didnt. Dont waste your money on this one."
1,Broken,Plugged it in and waited 30 seconds- nothing. The handle and the power cord started to heat up but the cutting end remained cold. Probably a short circuit inside the handle. Returned.
1,VerySlow,If you are not in a hurry or cutting a lot then this might work for you. The blade (wire) does not get hot enough at all. I am using it to cut packing foam and it won't even cut that.
1,Buyer beware!,"The cutter broke 15 minutes after I started using it! The end of the cutter was not tightly crimped. I was very gentle using the cutter using only low pressure per the instructions. It did a good job cutting the styrofoam but it was slow. The problem is that when I pulled it back while cutting in the styrofoam, the cutter end pulled out of the crimp near the handle. This broke a wire in the cutter which shorted out and blew a circuit breaker. There goes my $20.00!"
1,Broken,"This product worked fine for about an hour. Then it stopped, went cold. Probably in the switch; but there is no way to get at it. Not recommended."
1,Not happy,The product did not work. It cost me $10 to ship it back and received $6 credit.So it cost me $4 and a run to the USPO.
3,Good price but underwhealming performance,"This is about the cheapest you will find a styrofoam cutter for but the product gives mixed results. I ordered this to replace an old wire foam cutter that broke. This product gives less even cuts, is harder to cut strait with and produces a lot more fumes then the wire cutter. The upside is that this costs about half the price of the wire cutter. Its good if you are on a budget or need it for only one or two projects. My group makes wargame diorama terrain pieces with foam on a regular basis and this product just did not cut it for heavy use or precision."
2,Slow Blade,If you are working with thin Styrofoam and have lots of time on your hands this product will work. The blade does not heat up well and takes a long time to go through Styrofoam.
4,Good but not great.,"I use it to cut 1 1/2"" styrene in my model railroading. The cutter does a nice job, but if I push it too fast the rod bends. So far I have been able to restraighten it."
1,Easily Broken,"I just recently bought this and, ever since I took it out of the package, I have used it a total of three times. I handled it with care as per instructions: don't get it near water, do not force through the styrofoam, etc. However, for whatever reason, it just stopped heating up when I tried to turn it on. It's completely ridiculous! It feels pretty flimsy, too, and not very high quality. At this price, I would be better off buying an electric jigsaw at about the same price to cut through my foam sheets."
1,Mine was junk,"Got one of these, I plugged it in the metal part sticking out never got hot at the end.Heat built up near the handle and it began sagging and melting the plastic case.Never worked, even if it had, it was flimsy and I would not have trusted it to do anything useful.I went with a blade and paid more money, but at least it is a solid trustable tool.When dealing with high temperatures you like to feel that you are ""safe"" in using something like this.The styro wonder is a hazard and I don't recommend anyone buy it."
1,Jagged cutting,"This did not look as shown above, different shape and color but essentially the same thing. The wire did not heat up very well and the cuts were very jagged. I tried allowing it to heat up longer and cutting slower with no improvement. If you plan on using this a lot or for anything requiring perfect lines pay extra money for something that heats up a great deal more."
5,Great Collection!,"Great collection of songs. I sent it to my dad for father's day as a sentimental gift, he really enjoyed it...brought back memories!Lots of great songs, very good quality cd."
3,DC5 decerves better,"Dave Clark 5 was the poor sister to the Beatles, the Ricky Nelson to Elvis. And, like Rick never appreciated until gone.DC5 (how cool is that!)were damn close to having as many hits as Beatles. They were as good as rocking as they were as ballads.Mike Smith, the singer, shouted and crooned as best as any 60's beat generation.This CD ""History of Dave Clark 5"" is supposed to be rare.The ""History of Dave Clark 5"" on LP is rare.All we have is what now available...CD "" History"" now begs $50.00 moreworth it?No not until Dave Clark allows the true mono and stereo mixes of the hits.What to do?There are CDRs that abound and stay away from themI advise a turntable and a 45.One question: Dave Clark was a perfectionist at showing drums up front and never got appreciationis that why he refuses to release quality versions of DC5?"
2,too much of a mediocre thing,"If you are really in need of a ""Dave Clark Five"" fix, this just may be the album for you. On the other hand, there is a lot a mediocre-at-best filler in this 2-cd collection, most of which certainly cannot be called ""greatest hits"". Thus, the title ""History of...."". In fact there are at least 20 songs which are tough to listen to even once! The true greatest hits, of which there are about 8, should have been put onto a one-cd release. With the money you would have saved, you could buy the Searcher's greatest hits."
3,Why are these tracks mono?,"Never expected that anyway. Sure it's nice to have original single releases (mono) but this day and age, why would producers waste their time on this? If you can dig up master tapes of mono tracks, surely could have gotten stereo ones... which also exist from the LPs. Disappointing. Now we're still in limbo waiting for a REAL collection..."
5,The DC5 finally gets recognized,"They were often compared to The Beatles. Even unfairly called ""copy cats"" and that is a shame because they were much more than that and much better than many give them credit for. When you start reading off and listening to the songs they made, you will realize that they had much more going for them than the critics gave them credit for. I personally liked them better than The Beatles at the time. The playlist includes:Glad All Over, Bits and Pieces, Any Way You Want It, Little Bitty Pretty One, Catch Us If You Can, Try To Hard, All Night Long, Nineteen Days and many more. Fifty classic tracks from a classic 60s band.UPDATE: In December, 2007 it was announced that the DC5 will be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. This has been way overdue!! This 2 disc set should be re-issued right away!!!"
4,"Please Dave, give us more.","In the ""Hey Day"" days, I collected all the DC5 albums I could afford with my weekly allowance and lawn mowing money. The History cd's are great to have, but only a temporary ""fix"".Please Dave, release all the albums to cd. I soooooo much miss ""You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby"" and ""Red And Blue"". I don't hear these played on any oldie stations.Now I can afford to buy any DC5 album I want, and there's only one."
2,Disappointed,"When I discovered that this long-awaited collection was released, I grabbed it.What a disppointment. Every selection is in one-dimensional mono.WHY WEREN'T ANY STEREO MIXES INCLUDED???By the way, most, if not all the selections were recorded in full stereo. The 1967 LP ""You Got What It Takes"" was released in stereo and sounded great (not like those ""electronically reprocessed"" which decieved and ripped off audiophiles).One of the long out of print Greatest Hits compliations included true stereo recordings of original recordings.Dave Clark learned one lesson: how to rip off and disappoint fans."
5,All Dave Clark Five material,"This is a very good sampling of their material, but all their material is available on the mp3 format out of St. Petersburg. Go to the American website of the Dave Clark Five and check the menu. Good quality on 7 albums compressed."
4,missing hits...,"Although this 2-cd sets have a lot of their hits, for Filipino DC5 fans, there's quite a few hits that were not included. To name a few: Your Turn to Cry, Forever & a Day, Sometimes, etc. Also the song Till the Right One Comes Along is an edited version & does not include the piano part in the adlib. Anyway CONGRATS to the DC5 for being inducted in the R&R Hall of Fame & sympathies for the passing away of Mike Smith & Dennis Peyton."
4,Good Lightsaber for the Price,My sons have about a dozen lightsabers of all varieties. This was a stocking stuffer for Christmas. It's not a higher quality toy sword - it does not light up. But it does extend about 3ft. The boys still love it!
3,more value than the tiny star war accesories,"My 7 yr old loves these light sabers.He owns three and uses them, alone or with buddies, or me if he can get me to do it, as much as he can. I guess it's swashbuckling. It's a bargain for the hours of fun, especially compared to all of those tiny overpriced lego starwars guys, kits, etc."
3,Not play quality,"As has been stated elsewhere, this is a costume prop and not as rugged as the toy lightsabers from Hasbro. The plastic for the light cones is thinner than the toy versions and much easier to bend and break. Also, it lacks the belt clip and sliding button used when extending the toy versions. On the plus side is does light up albeit weakly and still fully withdraw into the handle unlike the electronic toy sabers. Overall, good for show, but easy to break when the kids duel."
1,Poor quality,"I bought this product two times and I ended returning it. Whew! Dont buy. Waste of money. Even they will give it for free, I will still return it."
2,What Ties These Three Stories Together?,"Not much, it is way too subtle for me to understand what these 3 women's lives and stories have in common. This is one of those films where you appreciate the magnitude of your problems compared to the characters' as theirs are 100 times worse than yours. I might have appreciated this film more if it had focused on one of the women and only told her story.Why does Kyra Sedgwick's Delia stay with a man who despises her and have 3 kids with him? How about Parker Posey's Great going from also ran editor to superstar - is it really that easy? Why is Fairuza Balk's Paula out in a club and interested in the Norwegian dude? Each one of these could have used more backstory.Ron Leibman's Avram Herskowitz is an obvious ripoff of Alan Dershowitz.Rebecca Miller directed and wrote the film based on her book. This movie looks like it was shot on tape in an eternally smoky haze - was that the only way to ""soften"" these characters?"
1,Salmon Trout,What is 'Salmon Trout' ? Salmon and trout are two different fish. Is this a mistake or a new species I'm unaware of.
1,The Most Pathetic Film Ever Seen.,"One of the worst films I've ever seen in the history of science fiction or film ever. The scenes are choppy, the acting is second rate at best; I can see why this movie never went to the theatres, it would have lost the company millions. What was the budget of this thing, a $1.00? The plot is synonymous with a 1960 black and white sci-fi monster flick. If that's your objective for some random violent and blood/sex flick, I'd recommend Starship Troopers II. Otherwise save your money on the rental or purchase and let the original be the measurement of what Starship Troopers is."
2,"OK, I don't like this 'countdown to No 1' stuff, could have been better","Not a good 3D movie, no wonder it is on sale. would not recommend it. it is not even a good documentary."
1,DON'T,Low budget 3D movie. The IMAX Hubble one is WAY better. This is the kinda movie you can mute and watch 2 star 3D effects.
3,the universe:7 wonders of the solar system 3d,This movie would be best suited for children.It has no entertainment value what so ever.Beginner solar system info.Boring.5th grade or below.
2,Sevem Wonders of the Universe,We were turned off by the fake space ship in the DVD. That was a distraction from viewing the essence of the DVD. Was expecting more and would not purchase this again.
2,Not worth the money,"When I purchased this blue ray, I thought I was buying a product at least the length of a movie. Instead all I got was a 40+ minute episode from TV. I paid way too much for it and I wish I had read more about it before paying for it. Let the buyer beware."
2,TV show without commercials,"The 3D effects were average, but the biggest dissapointment to me was that it seemed like a television documentary with the commercials removed."
1,"Mediocre at Best, not Much Oomph, if you ask me.","1 star only for the effort. I agree with other's assessments regarding this 3d blu ray. I have a high end 3d TV. Viewing this 3D blu ray wasn't eye popping high that I had expected. I bought the 3D video based on other's reviews, which was a mistake. Maybe others don't need to be WOWed by 3d to consider something decent, but for me, it was typical History Channel production, converted to 3D. IMHO, I'd rent this in 3D before deciding to buy. Just my two cents. I'm thinking of selling my copy."
3,okay,"Really nice dvd, a basic look into the universe and only encompasses 7 unknown aspects of our solar system. It was really enjoyable until halfway through when the sound started to cut out. If you don't find that to be a problem this blu-ray is pretty good."
1,What 3D Viewing; Looks Like 2D,"This video picture whether in 3D or 2D is the same. You do not have to wear any glasses there is no difference. Your TV is converting the picture to 3D thats it. They also insert an Evolutionist perspective throughtout the video. Reference ""Millions"" of years and formation of life, transmutation, etc. If you are expecting a 3D quality ride through space forget purchasing this video...Amazon is Still the Best regardless of my comment here."
4,Good test show for 3d setup,"I like this documentary from the History channel, even if some of it is a bit hokey. The 3d is pretty well done with only a minimal amount of crosstalk or bleed through. If you like astronomy, you'll probably like this."
2,"Space in 3D Looks Nice, But This is No Final Frontier","I was very disappointed in the 3D effects in The Universe. For a space feature, you should have awesome 3D popping out effects, and there were none here. I will refer you all to my Mummies: Secrets of the Pharaohs 3D review I just made on here, because what I wrote there applies here as well."
3,It's just okay,Got this for my new 3D blu-ray player. I was hoping to be wow-ed but it was just ok. Not the worst I've seen and not the best.Glad I didn't spend a lot of $ on this.
1,Disappointing,"I think the the title is enough. Don't waste your money or time. The spacecraft, images, unfortunately a bad production on a nice theme."
1,Don't waste your money,"Very little science, so its not an educational show, very cheap computer graphics used for the ""3D"" portion, so the picture is not awe inspiring (its actually very cheesy with the little ""spaceship"" they used), and its extremely repetitive of content. In reality its probably only about 26 minutes long, but they repeat segments to stretch it out to 47 minutes. Its worth about $2.99 like any other TV show you can download."
