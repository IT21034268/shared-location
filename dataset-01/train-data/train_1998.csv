5,Awesome,This is an amazing CD. The earth wind and fire tunes are great. The jazz versions are hip and fun. I listen to it all the time! This CD has my favorite song on it called she is on her way. It is so smooth. GO DON! Keep doing what you are doing.
5,The Food I Love,The book is wonderful. It was delivered very fast and arrived inexcellent condition.
5,Great Italian recipes,"At 440 pages, this is a huge cookbook of authentic Italian cooking. Unlike other ethnic cookbooks, this one is a ""learning"" cookbook that takes you by the hand and teaches how to do each task which may be as simple as boiling an egg, much like the great cookbooks of yore...Betty Crocker or Julia Child for instance. However, the recipes are not everyday country fare but what I would consider to be grand Italian...the kind of dishes you would expect to find in a very good, up-scale Italian restaurant. Need I say more? Recipes are great and cookbooks dealing with authentic Italian cuisine don't come our way often."
4,"Good band, recorded only one official album",You'll hear Rudy de Queljoe and John Schuursma in the songs after 1969. Akkerman quit the band after a year.
5,Great equipment for low cost,For the cost this does a great job if you only need to use a headset a few times a week as I do. This is a great add on for those doing webinars on the web where telephone connect is required.
4,Works well,"I ordered this headset after it was recommended to me by a friend. It arrived quickly and I was impressed by it's design. It seems very sturdy but that is probably because I am used to much less expensive headsets. It was fairly easy to set up but there seems to be so many cords involved. I also had to purchase a new telephone because it did not work with my cordless telephone.The sound is great. Very clear on both sides. The noise cancelling feature does work on some background noise but not on all. Also, I don't like the fact that you have to pick up your telephone headset and press a button every time you receive a call--but I guess there isn't much to be done about that."
3,Good Enough Headset,"If you are someone who prefers an over-the-head headset, this version is a good enough option (particularly if your company is footing the bill). The sound is clear and the headset is comfortable. The construction is not the best as inevitably it always breaks. This purchase is the third one I have bought because eventually the sound has gone (i.e. the caller can no longer hear me or I can no longer hear the caller). I continue to buy the same model however because I still have not found an over-the-headset that is as good (for as long as it lasts that is)."
4,"Great headset, unbeatable for the price.","We bought two of these for our small office and they are great. Easy to use, with a very quick set up. We've had no problems with either unit and the sound quality is very good after an initial test call to adjust. I would highly recommend these. We looked at pricier units, but they didn't offer much more. The only drawback is that the earpiece is not the most comfortable, but certainly will do."
3,Bare bones with some problems,"If you're in front of a computer and on the phone all day, it's likely your neck is starting to hurt from cradling the phone. This model performs as advertised, with the exception that some of the button functions for choosing headset or phone receiver work differently with differently phones. Also, be warned that to use this unit, you still have to pick up the receiver to activate the line. My neck stopped hurting, but the inconvenience of picking up and putting down the receiver, as well as the physical limitations of a corded headset, got me to order a bluetooth model with a ""cradle lifter"" mechanism that allows you to pick up the receiver remotely. (Better solution would be a dedicated phone or more sophisticated access to a normal business phone's functions). About 3 times more expensive (and it hasn't arrived yet), but as I often move more than 6 feet from my phone during the day, I'm hopeful it will provide a more complete solution."
3,"Super comfortable, but too loud","I've been using an S12 for two years now and really enjoy the comfortable headset. I am on the phone for up to four hours per day and don't get any ear fatigue or shoulder problems, but do find that the speaker is too loud, even on the lowest settings with my AT&T two line phone."
2,Works well first but doesn't last,"I have had the S12 for 2 years now, and although it worked flawlessly in the beginning, the quality degrades over the year to the point whereby it becomes unusable. First the channels die (there are six on the side) currently only 4 of these work. The transmit quality degrades, noise gets introduced in both transmit and receive streams and the noise gets so loud while the receiving quality gets so bad, that you can no longer use it. I like plantronics, it is the best company out there, but this product only has a shelf life of about 2 yrs. I am now shopping for another plantronics product that works."
4,Office headset,"My office has a 20 year old phone system and I was warned it can be hard to find a headset that works. This one does, and it's easy to use, works every time, has great audio and microphone quality. Lightweight headset. It set up in 5 minutes. Highly recommended"
1,Plantronics S12 Serious Echo Problem on Conference Calls,"This product does not work for me. Whenever I call into a conference call the ""group"" screams about echo type noise. This product has been a disappointment (junk) to me. I will return and try another product."
3,it's ok,"It works, not much more than that. I still have a squeal when using it, but any other compatibility setting is a total fail. Personally, for the money these cost, I think they need to make a better product. If you don't have JUST the right phone, you will get squeal and or static constantly. Need this for work...going to keep using it...wish it worked better."
3,TOO LOUD!!!,"I do like the headset. It makes it much easier to make calls when you don't have to hold onto the receiver the entire time. The noise cancellation also appeared to work well. At least no one picked up me typing on the keyboard yet.My BIGGEST COMPLAINT ABOUT THE UNIT IS OH DEAR GOD WHY IS IT SO LOUD????? I have everything on the lowest volume, and it's still murdering my ears in cold blood. The volume setting needs to allow for much lower volume for this to be comfortable to the ears."
1,Loud hum when connected to phone.,"I have tried 2 phones and still got a loud hum in the phone. I have now tried 3 phone lines. When I contacted Plantronics they sent me a unit marked ""Refurb"". It still did not work without the buzz. I also noticed if you tap on the case you can hear the tap in the headphone so the unit is harmonic for some reason. Anyway it does not work well and I now I have a Refurb unit I can no longer return to Amazon and get my money back. Beware!"
3,Expected more from Plantronics,"This headset serves its purpose, but is not the best. The quality of the product, however, also depends on the phone you are using to connect it with. The headset connects through the jack on your phone that connects your handset. So to use it, you plug the headset into your headset jack on the phone and then leave your phone off the hook. Every time I connect, I get a loud screeching noise, probably because the microphone of the headset is too close to the handset. There is no way to fix this as the cord provided is only about 6"" long. There is not a way to use a longer cord as the jack is not your standard size, it is specific to the handset jack. Also, there is usually a low buzz on the the phone line when using the headset. It is a decent headset, but not worth $70."
1,CHECK COMPATIBILITY FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have no idea if this device is any good because it was not compatible with any of the three common phones I have in my office. In fact, upon further investigation, this headset system won't work with any of the 1- or 2-line phones that Amazon sells...or that any other Big Box electronic dealer. You need to go to the Plantronics Web site, where you can use a kludgy ""compatibility tool"" to check on your particular model of phone, but good luck finding one thta will work.I returned this product and Amazon game me a full refund."
5,Perfect,"I have had this head set for well over a year and it works great! No static, and it has crisp sound! Perfect!"
5,FANTASTIC!!,"My job is a work-at-home job that requires me to take calls continuously. This Plantronics S12 ""amplification"" system has made my job incredibly easier. Now I NEVER have to ask the caller to repeat information. This product is a life-saver for me. No more straining to hear! I would HIGHLY recommend it!"
3,"The Buzz, and the Handset","I like the comfort, voice quality is great, just the buzzing noise is annoying and its still there even adjusting it to the best channel.I hate having to pick up the handset to answer calls, it should've been just a push of a button to answer the call."
4,Great Tool,I hooked this up to my office phone the minute I got it and have used it numerous times since! What a help and the sound is crystal clear. The headset is lightweight and stays in place. My neck has been saved from having to cradle the phone between my shoulder and head while I type on the keyboard.I purchased two of these; one for me and one for our assistant controller. I will be purchasing more of them for our office people!
4,Good quality; Lacking 1 accessory,excellent headset. Very comfortable and sound quality is excellent. The unit has separate volume controls for both the hearing and speaking. So I can hear all customers and they can hear me. The only thing I didn't like is that there isn't a mute button on the head set cord. You have to use the mute button on the phone. I'm using an AT&T model 993 phone.
2,Second Plantronics product that is really flawed,"I first bought the S11, and within just a couple weeks, I began to experience intermitten problems with the headset cable, where the audio would cut on and off on me while using it. I should have learned my lesson from that. I purchased the S12, thinking I would give plantronics another try. I get this out of the box, and find out that while I can hear the other person, no one can hear me when speaking on the headset. I promptly returned this product, and will never buy another plantronic product again."
3,"For the price, I am not impressed.","I have to work on the phone all day long. Because of that, I have to wear my headset. I don't know about you, but I stand up and move about a bit through out the and day to help avoid health problems like blood clots. However, with this new head set, it's very difficult to do that because the head set cord is way too short(6 ft.) . Trying to find an head set extension cord proved to be a difficult task because no one makes a good quality splitter. Because of that, I gave up and made my own. If you decide to do the same, I found that that the 4P4C jacks from Mouser work well.The mic placement does not appear to be well thought out. Instead of in front of your mouth, it's on the the side and not adjustable. I think this is the reason why folks hear an echo when they talk to me, I'm guessing it's a feedback echo. I may just give up on it and start to look for an adjustable headset with a better mic placement.So all in all, the base unit works as advertised."
1,Terrible. Don't waste your money.,"I read lots of reviews for this product. I thought it sounded great for what I needed. I ordered it. First one I got didn't work at all. LOUD feedback, echoing etc. I called Plantronics, tech support said the product was defective and to return it and get another. So I did. Amazon sent me out another one, 1 day shipping. This one worked...but didn't at the same time. I even bought a different phone to try it on. Both phones I used were on the compatible list. I could get a dial tone BUT no one could hear me and I could hear a very loud hum on my end.I sent it back to get a refund.Bought a Panasonic KX-TS105B phone and getting a Panasonic headset that works with it. Hoping these 2 will work for my work at home needs.Amazon customer service has been great to me throughout this whole process. Not placing any blame on them. Only the product."
4,I'd rather it wasn't noise cancelling,"The headset is comfortable. I like the mute button. But I do hear a buzz depending on where the base station is with regard to the telephone, and the headset."
3,it's ok.,I think next time i'll go for the wireless model. this is nothing to write home about. it does what it says it's supposed to do.. but i probably wouldn't buy this model again.
1,Plantronics gives plenty of feedback,I purchased the plantronics headset with the hope of going hands free for my multi-hour business calls. This product ended up being a hugh disappointment. The main problem with this headset is it frequently goes into a high pitched lock up disrupting my meetings. It is probably due to feedback between the ear and mouth pieces. So to give the product the benefit of the doubt I connected it up to another phone and it did the same thing. Unless you drop the gain down low enough so you can barely hear it will not squeal. Bascially making this product useless. The other issue was when I only wanted to use the handset it created a noticeable hum in the background.
3,"Good brand, has issues",I am frequently told by people that I am talking to that they can not hear me. It's hit or miss as to whether I am heard at a normal tone or a deafening one when I adjust the volume to compensate.
2,Not a good product,"I purchased this product which was defective. I sent it back and received a replacement. The quality of the product is really bad. I believe that it may be more of a headphone issue than a headset issue. There was only one ""channel"" that worked out of the 4 or 5 that were available. (I can't remember the number but it was at least 3 and no more than 5 channels). In any event, of the one channel that worked, there was a constant buzzing noise in the background. I bought this specifically because I have a hearlng loss. However, this is not the answer. The loudness is there but the quality and buzzing are a complete distraction."
2,You can hear your own voice!,"The first time I used this headset, I could hear my own amplified voice in the earpiece. As this is doesn't happen with a regular phone I assumed that I had hooked it up incorrectly. I contacted Plantronics and they said this: ""You will have side tone. Sorry it can't be disabled. You can lower it by lowering the mic volume. That is the switch with the small dot and large dot on the side of the base. Most people use the small dot."" I'm returning this headset as it way too expensive to have such as basic limitation."
4,Decent for the price,"This headset is a decent purchase for the price. I bought 12 of them for our company and every one of them was a little finicky to set up. It seems as if the cheap construction has allowed for variance in performance. Some of them were as easy to install as the instructions detailed. Others had to be positioned just right on the desk (I assume because of poor internal wire connections). I had to return one unit that had no sound (the Amazon return procedure is AMAZINGLY customer friendly!!!) and the replacement unit was set up with no issues. The feedback from the end users is that they like the option of using the headset or the earpiece depending on the type of calls they are on but, the earpiece sound level is too high at its lowest level. Overall, it's a decent product for the price!"
4,Not bad,"The sound quality is pretty good for this device. It works with our expensive phone system. It gets tangled and that gets irritating. Otherwise, good sound quality."
2,disappointment--back to the days of crystal radios,For what was a promise of convenience and an office aid--I am shocked at the flimsy set up and simplistic instructions that took more trial and error to get it to work
4,Great Headset,This headset is being used with our new VoIP phone system. Did not require control box feature/functionality but the headset itself is excellent and it is connected directly to the phone.
5,Great - especially for the money,This works great! Took a couple trys to get the right setting but once I found it - the quality of the calls were fine! Definately recommend!
5,Great product,"This product performs great. Easy to install, easy to use, requires only basic phone and phone line. Love the hands free feature and the sound quality is awesome."
3,Mediocre,"I have been using my plantronics wired headset for about 5 years, before that it was used for another 3 years or so and still works like a charm. So I trusted history to repeat itself and purchased what seemed like the newer, improved model... not so much. The clarity is great when being used but if you happen to pick up the phone without using the headset there is an annoying clicking sound in the background. I haven't looked into any of the settings so perhaps that could be the issue.Durability is fine, the ear piece is comfortable and can be worn for long periods of time, in fact all day if you'd like. It has nice simple features which I like as well."
2,Not that good,These units have always had a hum in the background that will give you an ear ache in a short time. Smith Corona is a much better sounding amplifier.
1,USED!,This product has clearly been used and is not specified in the product description. Box was in poor shape and contents inside were not in factory packaging.
5,Works great. Easy installation.,"Due to pain in my elbows that makes it hard to hold a handset to my ear, I was looking for a headset to use at work. From the other reviews I read, I wasn't sure the S12 would work with more than 2 lines. It works great with our phone system that has 8 lines. It was easy to connect and adjust. The sound quality is great. The headset is comfortable. Great bang for the buck."
1,Absolutely horrible!,This product is horrible....the voice on the outgoing and incoming is garbled and I can only hear one or the other. Not sure if my unit was defective or just a horrible product. Going back immediately. I need this for work and this was not the answer.
1,Can't get past the hum,"I really don't care if the I can hear and people can hear me if there's also a hum in the phone. Its not loud, but it's enough to seriously annoy me. I don't have a cordless phone hooked up and I have tried all the adjustments. It was causing a hum in the handset so I had to disconnect and I am returning it. I need a headset as I am on the phone all day for my job, but I'm scared to buy another plantronics because I can't take that hum!"
3,Only works w/ certain phones,"Just purchased the S12 along w/ a new Panasonic 2-line phone unit that has a cordless handset also. After connecting everything, had a bad AC hum when using the phone. After checking, found it was the S12 causing the hum. Disconnect S12, no hum. Contacted Plantronics tech support for help. After describing problem and giving make and model of my phone, the tech said that the hum was because the phone had a cordless handset besides the corded one on the base. He said NONE of their units will work with ANY phone that has a cordless handset involved. So, had to return the S12 for a refund. Be warned, Plantronics products will only work properly on regular corded only phones. Now have to find a company that makes a headset that WILL work w/ the phone that I have."
4,Perfect fit and sound for my webcasts,I purchased this headset because I have started presenting webcasts and needed to make sure that the sound quality was superior. The Platronics S12 meets that requirement (and exceeded my expectations) and gives the wearer great flexiblity to control the sound. My only complaints are the short cord between the telephone and the Platronics base and the flimsy stand used to hold the headset when not in use. Both of these problems are minor and can be corrected through a little ingenuity.
1,had a very strong echo,"I have this same product 12, but this one seemed to be of less quality, very strong echo. I could have received a lemon, but it was not the same quality sound of the one that i purchased in the store."
4,"For ""old timers""","I searched a long time before I found this headset system that could be used on an ""old fashion"" phone. My home phone is a plain ""old timers"" phone since I don't need any bells and whistles. The headset base clips into the handpiece plug on the phone base with a square jack plug. The cord that connects the phone and the base is very short - about 11 inches. The headset cord is long but you still need to be within 6 ft of the phone to use. I purchased this so that when I'm on a conference call, I could still see my computer screen and not have to juggle a handpiece. As other reviewers have said, it would be better if both cords were longer. Adjusting the volume also takes some getting used to otherwise you can get a humming sound. I also found this same system in a local national office supply store for about double the cost."
3,Good Product,This worked very well for me as I have a home office and this was exactly what I needed.
5,Great--very quiet,A bi-audio headset I replaced this one with was not nearly as good. This one is terrific. You can mute you own voice without an annoying click.
2,S12 Headset,"I purchased 3 of these in June and had to return 1 due to it not working. I purchased a 4th one in November to have it match the others, and we did not have our phone system set up to use this yet. We had our system set up and had 2 vendors out, and we could not get this headset to work."
2,Internal connection failure,"I thought I could get by with the S12 and put up with the wire for home use - probably would have worked out ok had the internal connection from the phone worked. I had to hold the connection to keep contact and tried three different cords, so pretty sure it was the internal connection. Return was easy, though. I now have the CS50 from Plantronics, same wireless unit that I have at office, and it worked first time without having to set any compatibility settings. I love Plantronics products, this one just did not work for me."
4,Plantronics headset,Plantronics Headset System provides the feature I needed. Easy to use and good quality sound.Price was quite reasonable.
2,3 of 8 are defective,"We just ordered 8 of these for our small call center operation that we started on Monday. By Thursday we had to 'jiggle the wires' to get them to work, and 3 now don't work at all. I came back to the site today to figure out how to return them. If you intend to use headsets heavily, try another model or brand."
1,Constantly Breaking,"I am a buyer and am on the phone all the time. In the past two years the ear cuff has broken twice and the speaker has broken twice. My last job I had a headset system and don't remember the name of it, but in the 5 years I used it, it did not break even once. I do not recommend this one and now I am on the hunt for a new one."
2,Felt like it was a waste of money,Too many steps to take to answer phone. I finally just bought a phone and hooked a headset to it. It was much easier to use than this.
4,Work Well.. well..,The instructions to set up this thing looks like something from the 1950's to set up a stereo.. good things that the company has such a good product.. the voice quality was amazing.. still I'd like to see instructions that relate to all the items.. plus ones that reflect the actual look of certain parts.. grouses. really tho.. i'm looking forward to try this out.
1,angry,i am very angry. this product has a lot of static and i needed it for my first job and this is what i get
2,Lots of feedback,"Initially this product seemed great, but then I started getting a lot of feedback and now I cannot use it because the other caller can hear it as well. Do not recommend."
4,Good Product for the price,"So far this product has been very good to me. Clients come in really clear, and they say I come in really clear too. The ear piece could be a bit softer. The headband is not too tight. I have no complaints about any other part so far. I've only had it for less then a month."
3,Brittannie,"The headset worked properly and as expected for the first month, then suddenly the volume would decrease without warning. I try to raise the volume and the volume lever goes up but the volume does not increase."
5,Plantronics Telephone Headset works well,It was easy to set up and use. I use it with an Eclipse2 by Inter-tel phone. The sound quality is good and the headset is comfortable. The cord is reasonably long
4,Great Hands Free Product,The convenience and comfort of this product makes it a great choice for hands free operation. I recommend this to all busy communicators.
2,LASTS LESS THAN A YEAR?!???!?,"What's up with this? I bought this because it was highly recommended. Yeah, I recommend it if you only want to use it once in a while. It was great at first, then it started hanging up on customers after a few minutes. It began to have A LOT of static and boom..HANG UP! I guess it is not bad if you don't mind paying $75.00 every 9 months!"
3,Not for use with magicJack,"In an effort to arrange an inexpensive dedicated business telephone line solution with a hands-free headset I purchased the magicJack and the Plantronics S12. Although the magicJack works great with other analog telephone devices, and the Plantronics S12 works great with other analog lines/services, it would appear that the magicJack together with the Plantronics S12 does not work. I thoroughly tested all 6 modes, the 2 TX amplification settings, the two volume slides, the mute button, all of the cables. Upon speaking with the Plantronics support line, upon concluding our troubleshooting, they advised that the S12 only works with traditional analog telephone lines and not analog-to-Internet conversion solutions like the magicJack. On the surface and given the other reviews it seems that the S12 is a great product, but does not work with the magicJack telephone service."
5,Has relieved this nagging crick in my neck...,"I take the minutes for several weekly telecons that can each last 1-2 hours. To say the least, this headset system has been a ""neck-saver"". Since I type the minutes as I listen, I need both hands, and trying to cradle the phone receiver between my chin and shoulder for an hour or more gives me quite the pain in my neck. I don't move around much during the telecon, so the corded system works fine. The buttons are nice and big; the mute button is especially useful."
4,phone headset,"With the short period I've used this headset, I'm very happy with it. I've been using over-the-head headset and it is very comfortable. The sound is very clear and the system is very easy to set up.If I could spend more time with it, I'll probably will give it a 5 stars"
4,Home Office Use,"I purchased this headset for use with long conference calls and Support Line calls. I have been happy with it since day 1 (I have had it for about 4 months). Headset stays put, sound is good, controls are simple. I haven't run into the other issues that others have mentioned. If you want a simple corded headset, this is the one."
5,Gussie is great!,"I have had this book for over a year. I enjoy reading it to my nieces and nephews and re reading it myself and to my children. this book beautifully illustrates and describes the importance of tradition, environmental preservation and the value of story telling. I highly recommend Aunt Gussie and the Grandfather Tree for all ages!"
3,READ IF YOU OWN A VIEWSONIC!!!,"THE USE OF THIS PRODUCT ACCORDING TO VIEWSONIC CUSTOMER SERVICE VOIDS YOUR WARRANTY. I USED THIS PRODUCT, AND CLEANED THE SUCTION CUP MARKS OFF THE SCREEN WITH THE SUPPLIED CLEANER, AND THE ANTI GLARE/STATIC STARTED COMING OFF. Upon contacting customer service, they informed me that any use of any cleaning material on their monitors is not covered under warranty and is considered abuse. They do not recommend using ANY color calibration device on the monitor as it may cause damage, and is not covered under warranty. However they can not tell you how to color calibrate it with out devices, or clean it without touching your monitor. So if you own a viewsoncic DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!"
2,dissatisfied,"This would probably be quite a good product, and useful too, that is if the Pantone people bothered to tell you that it WILL NOT WORK with earlier versions of Photoshop (certainly 5.5 anyway. I was seriously annoyed when, having installed the software and calibrated the monitor it wiped out Photoshop. You can re-install Photoshop, however, it's to no avail as subsequent fact finding has shown that the color profile it creates will not work with early Photoshop versions. All it takes is a warning from Pantone at time of purchase and in their many reviews. Now I have to buy a later Photoshop version (which I really do not need) in order to use Huey. Pantone - NOT GOOD ENOUGH!"
1,Works - sort of,"Following the instructions to a 'T' - Each of the four monitors I have tried this on end up with different results. I installed the software and device on my workstation which has two LCD screens. After calibrating each monitor per HUEY, the monitors do not display content with the same color or intensity. In example, if I take a blue box from screen one over to screen two, it will now be a duller grayish blue appearance. Reds end up with a browner appearance on one of the monitors. I tried the software and device on my wife's dual screen workstation - though the results were different, the screens still did not display colors the same. As an added point - the onscreen colors were nowhere near the actual Pantone Chips that this product is suppose to ensure matching."
3,Pantone is fixing the issue of color cast now,I bought Pantone Huey Pro back to April this year. It worked good before it suddenly had a color cast from two weeks ago. I searched web and found that it happened to a lot of users. Pantone has been aware of this bug and trying to fix. I used their online system to report this issue one week ago and got a reply today. They offer me an eyeone display2 as a replacement. Will see if this one can solve the issue.
2,Magenta-Hue after calibration.,As many others have reported before me there are a lot of defective units of the Pantone Huey Pro. I happened to receive one in my recent purchase from Amazon.After contacting Pantone's customer support I was promised a new Huey Pro within 7 to 10 business days. (+1 star for support staff)Let's be hopeful that the new one doesn't give me PINKISH WHITES. :T6/12/09 Update:The replacement unit I got from Pantone leaves a very slight blue overcast. I don't even know if I should bother asking for another replacement. This product is garbage.~Quinnyfizzle
4,Worth its money!,"Some people might say Pantone huey Pro MEU113 is not the most accurate calibration software-hardware on earth. I agree with them, but who expects more for 100 Euro? It does what it promises to do at a low cost. It is suitable for home users and professionals who need an average color and lightness consistency without spending half a fortune. Overall, I think it's good to be out there..."
3,"Pretty decent, some reservations","The Pantone Huey Pro works pretty well, and the price is right. I'm very happy with the color calibration; I didn't see the green or red cast that other people reported. I did have a couple of reservations, though:- It's very hard to establish the white point, at least on my LCD monitors. It may have something to do with viewing angles on the LCD screen.- I'm not convinced that the ambient light detection works well. When I turned it on, the screens became too bright and contrasty. When I turned it off, they went back to normal.- Although the instructions say that the suction cups pose no danger to LCD screens, and they seem to have done no harm other than leaving behind some rings that wash off, I still have my doubts about whether it's a good idea to apply suction cups to LCD screens. Users might want to consider simply hanging the device by the cord from the top of the monitor, and not using the suction cups."
3,Huey or Fooey?,"HueyPro comes with, in my opinion, very poorly written documentation. It's easy to install but not so easy to determine if the monitor is adjusted properly because the instructions are vague at best. I like it better than my old Spyder however."
1,Faulty product,This product did not work on any of the three monitors I tried to calibrate. It turned everything green. It's either an untrustworthy product or a faulty one.
2,DOESN'T LAST,I purchased mine in April 2011 and it is now no longer working. I am going to take a look at DataColor's Spyder 4.
1,Poor quality and inaccurate,"I used my Pantone huey Pro with the latest software version (hueyPro 1.5) to calibrate my Dell 2001FP LCD monitor and ended up with a reddish/pinkish tint. My monitor was clean and I tried multiple times with varying ambient lighting but the tint remained. I thought maybe this *was* accurate and that I just needed to get used to it. Unfortunately, the tint was just too severe to get used to. Plain white, for instance, just didn't look white at all. And reading the other reviews, it seems I'm not the only one who had this problem.I eventually game up and returned the Pantone huey Pro. I bought aColorVision Spyder2 Express Win/Macinstead. The resulting calibration has been much more reasonable."
1,Doesn't work - returned it,"Plain and simple, this doesn't work. It made the color on my monitor a horrible green cast. Pantone sent a replacement, which then gave the monitor a horrible red cast. Both hueyPros made my monitor much worse than when I started."
2,Inferior Performance,"I am a semi-professional photographer and in the interest of saving money I purchased this for my color management. Assuming my copy gave typical results , I find it useless, I calibrated my macbook pro and an external lcd monitor and there was a significant difference after calibration. the external monitor was cooler by several hundred degrees kelvin. if you want color management i suggest you purchase one of the more trusted products such as the Spyder 2 pro or eye-one.I have worked in retail for years until recently and the moral of the story is you get what you pay for."
1,Not a fan,"I have two monitors and it calibrates them differently, which means one or both is inaccurate. I'm still struggling to return it. It's not very self-sufficient either. It relies on you to help calibrate it and make adjustments. And you have to keep going through the calibration process regularly."
3,Good tool,"I ordered this colorimeter to get a consistent workflow of my digital photos seen on my LCD flatscreen monitor and later in printouts. After calibration I did only see a minor change in the color settings. The device adjusts more visibly the brightness/contrast ratio of the screen according to the surrounding light conditions. This is especially helpful when adjusting B&W photos in post-processing. It is a good tool to have to see photos in brightness, contrast and color independent from differences in monitors and changing room light conditions. IMO a bit expensive for the job it does. Every so often the installed software asks for a recalibration which can be a bit annoying, but it can be ignored with a mouse click."
1,Strong Magenta Cast - Unusable,"Purchased this for a brand new Macbook 13"" running Leopard. Have used other brand colorimeters for several years on CRT displays.The HueyPro is easy to install and instructions are clear, but the results are completely unusable. Tried profiling with normal room lights, without any room lights, and in daylight. All resulted in a strong magenta cast. Back to the store it goes.Also tried it on a PC with a Sony CRT display. Same problem."
1,"If you are a serious photographer / graphics artist, stay away","I've got a brand new Macbook Pro, and a Dell 24"" LCD. After calibration, the monitors had a disturbing shade of magenta on them. Tried to find workarounds... spent a lot of time... but no use. Scoured the Internet and found a lot of people have this problem.It CANNOT deliver on it's number one promise: Accurate Color Calibration. The rest, therefore, doesn't matter. I don't care how good the software is, or how handy the tool is.Please stay away.~Jazzwall"
3,PRINTING WHAT YOU SEE,It helps - to a point - but don't expect to suddenly find all your colour matching problems are resolved. It would seem that a lot more money has to be invested in profiling before you can say whether you are approaching perfection!
3,Is it effective?,"Upon a recommnedation, I purchased this calibration tool expecting that what I would see on my monitor (new 24"" LCD) would be exactly what my B&W print output (from an Epson 2200) would yield. Not so! Despite several passes at the calibration process (after my monitor was purchased and independently calibrated), my prints were consistently darker and of slightly lower contrast that the screen image. My printer/paper/ink profiles were correct, as they have been prior to the use and calibration of my new monitor. In the end, I'm not sure it was worth investing the time and money on this device. Direct set up and calibration of the monitor (out of the box) along with Photoshop Elements image adjustment and proper printing profiles would in combination produce admirable results."
1,Beware...,"I was looking forward to having (from what I had heard) a very good calibration system. Well, after installing it and running the calibrater it rendered a VERY magenta cast to my calibration. I tried everything to correct for this problem. After a couple wasted hours I came across the FAQ on Pantone's site and come to find out, it is much more common than they would like to admit. I submitted several tech support emails and have yet to hear back from them. I am returning it back to Amazon as defective product and let them deal with it. Don't buy it...spend more money or rely on your own eyes for a much more accurate rendition of color!"
1,Pantone Is Screwing Up on HueyPro,"I ordered a HueyPro to calibrate my monitors. HueyPro had been advertised in photography magazines and seemed well-reviewed. When I received and installed it, it was defective (produced a red hue on both computers/monitors I used it on). I contacted Pantone, who said they are having trouble with defective HueyPro's, and that I should follow the instructions on their help site to get a replacement. Three weeks, two email follow-ups and two phone calls later, I have yet to receive a response from any complaint, or a replacement HueyPro. They keep saying they are ""going to ship the replacements."" How do they expect to stay in business with product quality and customer service like this?Don't buy it."
2,Pink Screen / Poor Customer Service,"This is a nifty item, however I had a problem with it making my new iMac screen look pink (which I see was F. Lau's problem too).. It is good to note that no matter which lighting I used the screen calibration always came out the same (meaning it was reading the colors coming out of my monitor consistently). Bad to note though, that I emailed the tech people at Pantone and they never got back to me. I plan on returning this product unless I can get them by phone and they can fix it. They get one more chance. It might work fine on other monitors. If it happens to work on yours, I think it's a good product to get."
1,"Bad product, non-existant customer service","Despite a few reviews that said a defective product cast a red tone on the monitor, I ordered the Huey Pro. I had read that customer service at Pantone sent a new product out in 2 days and decided even if I got a defective product, it would be corrected quickly. The setting flexibility in the Huey Pro seemed worth the possible hassle.I got my Huey Pro and installed it. Had a red cast on my monitor and so downloaded an update from Pantone as a previous buyer suggested. Still a red tone. I contacted customer service online and reported the problem. Over 3 weeks, I updated my customer service request several times and called the 800 number but had to leave a message. Still no response. Nada.I finally called the store that sold the product and they are sending a replacement. I hope it works. If not, I will return it and buy something else.At this point, I suggest you not bother with this product or company."
1,Utterly useless. A quality-control nightmare.,"I'm normally not so negative on a product, but this really is one of the worst I've used. No matter what I did, my MacBook Pro and Apple 23"" Cinema Display ended up looking pinkish/brown. I've read numerous reports of this, but still took the plunge. I've also read of people getting slightly different results between identical Hueys, so clearly this device is not being tested correctly. In any case, the product may in fact work if you get a GOOD one, but since that's a risk nobody wants to take, there's no possible way to recommend this device. I since bought a Spyder2 and have had nothing but joy from it.Stay away."
1,Everything looked magenta afterward,"Used it to calibrate three different monitors - an old 16"" Eizo LCD, a Dell laptop, and a Compaq laptop, and all came out looking the same shade of magenta. Just didn't work and had to return it."
1,Never updated for Snow Leopard on Mac's,The software has never been updated for Snow Leopard. I will not buy a Pantone Huey product again. They have a perfectly substantial sized Mac user base in the graphics arts community and to not update this took which is still in production is unprofessional. The results when I used in on Tiger were ok.
1,Same cast as described by others,"Don't get this piece of gadget! Thought that I might be able to get one without the color cast problem as alot of people have mentioned in here already but it's true. Don't buy it. The first one gave me a red color cast and same goes for the second one I requested from Pantone. Just in case, if you want to request for a second one to try, I'd suggest emphasizing on the urgency of you needing a replacement quick, otherwise it will take a really long time until you receive it.With the same experience with second one I've received, I've decided to return the item back to Amazon. Yeah, it's inexpensive/cheap but doesn't do anything. It's a waste of money and time."
1,"Terrible, terrible, terrible","I had the same problem as everybody else who had a problem, the whole monitor turned pink. I should have listened but didn't. Returning was easy with Amazon and free so no real harm done, just a waste of time."
2,It turned my screen pink. Not good color rendition on first try.,I installed. Easy installation. I calibrated the device and checked the color against a picture with and without control. Without looked better. The screen had a pink background. I will try on another LCD to see if it is different. Still undecided.
1,"Used to work, but no customer support","I use this on a 2009 Mac Pro. It did not always, but now leaves a green color cast when used as directed. That is an issue I have repeatedly seen in online discussions about the product. To make matters worse, the company does not reply to emails about the product. I've had the item for a number of years, so I don't expect a replacement or refund, but I do expect a reply from support. I have learned to stop making purchases from companies that ignore their customers. Goodbye, Pantone."
3,"Good results, mediocre implementation","The good:Color calibration is very good. Now I can use a cruddy monitor and a good monitor together without having wildly disparate colors between the two.I also discovered that my visual calibration was running too warm (because of unconscious preference?)The price was quite good for the results.The bad:Have to press calibration device (lightly) to screen during process in order to get proper calibration.Mac OS use is annoying, because I have to keep unplugging the usb cable and plugging it back in to get the ambient light sensor to work. This problem does not occur in Windows.In Mac OS, I have to relaunch the preferences panes whenever I select the Huey.Pantone's support/download site requires login for any use, which is annoying."
4,Initail evaluation,This huey is easy to set up and use. It has made a big difference in my editing of photos. I do not have as many color issues as I did in the past.
2,Little black tint machine..,"Since i bought this about a month ago it has given me nothing but trouble..- Falls of the screen- The whole screen gets a green tint when you calibrate.- Pantone/x-rite support does not exist.The only god thing about this buy was amazon, super fast delivery!:)But, If youre looking at this, buy another calibrator."
1,There's a problem with the product.,"When I used the product for calibrating my LCD monitor, the screen had a slight reddish or orange cast. When I went to Pantone's technical support website, apparently this was a common thing and that their solution to this problem was to replace the unit. Does this mean that we are using the instrument to calibrate our monitors when theirs is not calibrated at all? Forget about getting any answer from their technical support. I posted my question weeks ago and the only reply I got was that they would get back to me in a few days. It's been almost 2 months now."
1,Everything turned a greenish color....,"I have heard so much over the years of the HueyPantone huey Pro MEU113and was very excited to finally get one. Unfortunately, it just didn't do what I expected. I tried this on two LCD monitors and the corrected colors on both of them was very greenish. I returned the product - it just was not as expected for me."
4,USB issues with Dell,"I purchased this to replace my Eye One which is misplaced. Once installed, the usage is much easier to use than the Eye One interface which I used before.Installation and usage of the Huey is flawed with my Dell Studio Xps which is running Win7 Professional 64 bit. The only way that the Huey sensor is recognized on my computer is when it is connected through a ""powered hub"". When connected directly to any of the computer's USB ports it is ""seen"" by the computer but only as an unrecognized USB device and does not function.Once I discovered this by experience and confirmed from a couple of forums, it works fine with this particular computer. If something between Pantone-Microsoft-Dell gets sorted out I would endorse it without qualifications."
1,PINK and BAD,"I purchased the HueyPro for its reputable ""Pantone"" name. Well, SURPRISE! The HueyPro gave me consistent pinkish unusable color profiles. After doing research online and looking at other reviews, I see this is a common problem recognized by Pantone. Very disappointed. So I followed Pantone's instructions to request a replacement. The autoreply said expect a reply in 24 hours. That was sent over 10 days ago, still no response. NOT RECOMMENDED! Unreliable product from an unreliable company"
1,Avoid this product,"I have been a photographer since 1986 and I'm also heavily involved in computer technology. This product does not work. After ""calibrating"", it put a greenish tint on everything. Realizing I had left my room lights on (flourescent) and attributing it to that, I turned off the light to make sure all the Huey ""saw"" was the monitor. The green tint got worse. My hand calibrated monitor had much more accurate color rendition. It's a great idea, but it seems to be somewhat flawed in its execution."
4,Absolutely Amazing,"This product is an absolute must have. Extremely fast and easy to use. I recently purchased a new monitor and could not seem to get the adjustments right on it no matter what I did. As a proffesional event photographer this was a major problem. The Huey Pro saved me. I cannot compare it to its competitors, as I have not used them, but with it's low (comparative) price this little device is absolutely amazing.My reason for only 4 stars: it seems that the build quality is a little cheap. Very light weight plastics and the thinnest usb cable I have ever seen.Buy it!! But, be really gentle with it!!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"As far as monitor calibration software/hardware goes, this is at the bottom of the barrel. It's not to say the product isn't good for the money but it's very hit and miss as far as an accurate reading goes. It will work brilliantly on some monitors and show a horrible red or blue cast on others as it over corrects. I still can't understand why. I've also come to realize that just about every one in about five of this piece of hardware that comes out of the factory has an inaccurate eye causing it to read false on ALL monitors. I've found this out from reading TONS of reviews.If you want something really worth keeping, you're going to have to throw out a good $250.00."
4,"Pantone Huey Pro does what it says, and with ease...","Although I'd read a number of negative reviews about the Huey Pro before purchasing, I bought on the strength of the Pantone reputation and a good experience with an earlier calibration device, the Eye-one Display LT. I'm using it on a CRT on a Windows XP Pro platform. It installed with no problem and is functioning as expected. The calibration process couldn't be easier and I especially like the ambient light adjustment feature."
1,AVOID!!!,"I've had this calibrator for just under a year. It has never been updated for use with the current Apple OS, and has recently started producing a strong magenta cast. I'm afraid it's going to be throw out - I certainly won't be buying anything from X-Rite / Greta Macbeth again. I suggest looking at the Spyder 3 series."
1,Do not buy this item,"Pantone huey Pro MEU113I read these reviews and purchased on the basis of what I read. The price was also seductive. I don't know if I received a defective unit or not but the unit I received makes everything turn pink. It is really quite horrible and I really don't know what else to say. Even if you are unable to afford a better unit right now, save for a better unit and buy it later."
3,1st one broke after 3 weeks !,Seems like a decent unit BUT mine broke after only 3 weeks and a couple of uses. I just stopped working in the middle of a calibration. Amazon is sending me a replacement so I'll report back later. Due to the failure I can only give it 3 stars now.
3,Nice - but there's a significant Mac issue.,"A good product - reasonably simple to operate and the results are good. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the little rubber grips keep slipping and the Huey pops off. I think I've solved this problem by putting a bit of spit on each one. Seems to work fine now, but of course it messes up my screen so I constantly have to wipe it off. The other problem is that the room light monitor keeps disconnecting itself and I have to unplug and re-plug in the USB connector. I contacted support and was informed that this was a problem exclusive to Mac users that they were getting endless complaints about. I asked when a fix was going to be issued and the guy just laughed - I was not amused. Pantone has a pretty decent Mac market (the preferred choice of graphic designers - who all use Pantone) and should address this issue. When I pay for a product I expect no issues and if there is one it better be fixed fast. Get with it Pantone."
3,Questionable quality,"I bought the Pantone Huey Pro to get all the computers I use at my job to be accurate. While the images they display all look the same now, what I see is NOT what I get. Yes it's easy to use but if you still can't make accurate prints based on what you see on your monitor, what's the point of buying something that is supposed to calibrate it?I waited a long time before buying something to calibrate the monitors I use because all the reviews of the affordable units were poor. And for my money, this unit is deserving of the same bad reviews as the units that came before it."
2,Disappointment.,I have used two different Pantone products previously and each worked far better than this one. I am disappointed and no longer use it.
5,Totally Pleased!!!!!,"We just recvd our HueyPro today and installed immediately. In a word: ""WOW"". I am a graphic designer and had some issues with monitor calibration using the MAC OS monitor calibration application in the past, but I can tell, NO MORE! Our 2 year old Dell UltraSharp LCD monitor shifted after the HueyPro calibration. (The desktop got darker, but photos were lighter? How does that happen?) We opened a couple images we had problems with in the past. And those images came out perfect as the printer's output. Really amazing tool.I had less success with a very old CRT that just lost it's color vibrancy. Obviously time for a new monitor on that MAC! Thanks Pantone!"
1,"Worse than no calibration (on windows, anyway)","I've tried this on two different Windows computers and ended up less happy with the colors than I was before attempting to callibrate. Light grays look pink, medium grays and browns look green, some skin tones look gray... My monitor may have a bluish cast, but at least it's consistent. Allowing it to adjust based on ambient lighting adds even more wackiness that I can't even describe. I uninstalled it and will not be using it again.However, a friend used the same device in Linux using different software (Argyll CMS, in particular) and it looks quite nice. So if you're using Linux I guess this thing is fine, otherwise get something else."
1,Doesn't work for my displays,"Keeps giving me an error when I reach the calibration stage:""Measurement error has occurred. Please check that the sensor is plugged in, and on the screen and that the correct display type has been selected.""Tried two different displays with same problem over and over again.Trouble-shooting only offers 3 possible suggestions for help, the same listed in the error message. None apply."
1,"Color disaster, not color correction.","Convinced by the amount of 4 and 5 star reviews I purchased the product to see if my LCD screen may need color correction. What a disappointment! I followed the instructions to the letter and ran the ""application"" three times! Every time so called ""color correction"" turns everything to pinkish reddish color. Will probably return it for refund."
1,"Easy to use, poor results","I've bought the Huey Pro to calibrate my MacBook Pro 2010 anti-glare screen and my Cinema display. The package is convenient, the software is easy-to-use but the overall result is so disappointing that I can't say any good about this product. My screens were totally uneven, the colors shifted towards the red scale and the overall look of the screens is way worse than the factory-provided screen profiles.If you plan to use this product for professional calibration on Mac - forget about it! All reviews online provide average positive results - but do not trust them.I guess I was just greedy to have a color calibration for less money..."
5,I love the entire 5W's series,"Great, fun and informative quick reads. You find yourself surprised at the little things you didn't know about! I have each one placed in a different room."
1,LaserLyte SleekPoint: Attractive But Disappointing,"The LaserLyte SleekPoint Laser Pointer by LaserLyte looks and feels great. It's huge button is also a plus. However, sometimes the laser would not respond very well, and after sitting unused in a box for about one year, the laser pointer no longer works, even with new batteries. These problems seem to agree with several comments made in other reviews. Look, feel, and price are important, but not if the laser doesn't work. I would not recommend this product. Stick to the pen-shaped pointers."
4,Light and small,"This laser pointer is incredibly light and small. It was even smaller than I imagined after seeing the picture. I tested this a bit and the range is really good. The button to activate the laser isn't the easiest to use, though. And there isn't a holster (although it will still fit in your pocket). But overall, this is a great product."
5,JR Mushrooms and Specialties is the Rolls-Royce of Gourmet Food Providers,"True story: I surfed online looking for difficult and expensive to find gourmet ingredients when I came across this listing. Every review raved about the excellent service provided by JR Mushrooms. I phoned them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voice-mail. I left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions. I ordered these truffles and several other items. The next morning there was a little personal e-mail from JR thanking me for the order and by noon the order had arrived, although I chose the cheapest shipping. THIS is the best customer service I have ever experienced with on-line shopping. Thanks!"
2,black truffles,I though this product lack flavor as I taste different brands far better.There were no real flavor as I expected. Sorry
1,No stars for this expensive garbage,"Zero stars for this item. I couldn't even confirm that the wrinkled little animal-offal sort of thing is a truffle. This lacks any aromatic attraction at all. I'd be afraid to put it in anything I planned to eat for fear it would ruin the entire item.As for the famous JR service, my complaints about this product have been ignored."
2,Nothing special,"These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and I'm not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one."
4,This is a fantastic light and funny read.,"I am a mid-thirties man in New York and I very much enjoyed this book. One thing strikes me right away - look how many people felt compelled to write a review on this book! An unknown author's first!This book is humorous and a lot of FUN. It is written in a very fresh voice. Mind you, you will learn nothing meaningful from this novel. It's a book for laughs and fun only. BUT IT IS TRUTHFULL.One reviewer wrote about the main character ""She's self-centered, self-important and feels that the world somehow owes her something."" Well, she's right. So? First, isn't this true about all of us? I have so much more than most everyone I know, and I still constantly complain about what I ""really want."" Don't we all? Second, who wants a character without flaws? Part of the fun is saying, ""I'm glad I'm not her.""If you want to laugh and get truthful insights into the mind of a typical New York woman in her twenties, give this book a read."
2,Amateurish and pointless,"I have a real soft spot in my heart for good chick lit, but unfortunately, this isn't it. I really can't believe that this type of writing would appeal to anyone beyond an inexperienced, starry-eyed high schooler. The characters are shallow, trendy, and apparently out getting wasted almost every night. Where's the smart, sophisticated heroine? Where's the well-written prose? Not here, that's for sure."
4,Good light reading,I liked this book and Momfriends by the same author. I would recommend for light reading. The 2000-ish setting was pretty cool and reminded me of my early post-college days.
1,DONT BUY THIS BOOK,"I had high hopes for this book, but it is truly vapid. A waste of time, with little substance, humor or realism."
4,"New Author ""on the verge"" of a hit!","""On the Verge"" by Ariella Papa is a great little gem for those early 20-somethings out there who are really doing what they want just yet - who haven't really met the right guy - and are all around, pretty confused. It has a touch of glamour with the parties and dates but all in all - it's the story of a normal young woman struggling to find her path in life.This genre has becoming increasingly popular and this newest addition is a great addition. Other books in the ""Red Dress Ink"" series are less then stellar but, this one is a clear winner with a lot of promise. I found Ms. Papa's style refreshing and a nice quick read. Other reviews have mentioned the few problems with the editing and grammar - I agree this was a bit distracting at times but all in all a great debut from a promising new author."
4,"Easy, fun read","This book is so easy to relate to if you are in your 20's, single, and working at an unchallenging job... and most of your time is spent going out with friends and on dates or at least thinking about those things. It is set in New York, and she is very descriptive about the city - I felt like I was right there."
2,not so good,"This book really isn't that good. I started it and within the first few pages had my doubts, but then the next couple of chapters started to get interesting so I went on. By the time I was about 2/3 of the way though I couldn't wait for it to end. The author could have done what she did here in about 1/3-1/2 the book and then carried the story out further. It's like she was writing to have a second book follow. The language is young and very obnoxious to read. Very strange book. Not that good in the end. Save your $."
1,Unlikeable characters,"This author tries very very hard to create a cross between Bridget Jones and Sex and the City, but it doesn't work. The main character is spoiled and shallow, and not even in a charming way. Having the narrator drink a lot and have one-night stands and whine about her not-bad job is supposed to make her interesting and sympathetic, but it doesn't. Her friends are boring or annoying or crude, and the men are cardboard cutouts.This book was in severe need of an editor, not only for structure but length. This piece of fluff should not have been allowed to go on for 300 pages. I suspect it wasn't edited at all--it just went from author's manuscript to press. The author does have some good lines and I think she might be capable of writing a better book someday."
1,Embarassed,"I STRONGLY dislike this product for 3 reasons:1. The tapes are poor in quality and will tear the briefs plastic cover regularly2. VERY NOISY- I swear the only people who won't be able to hear you walking will be at least 15 feet away or deaf3. LEAKS!!!!!!I was wearing this product earlier today as I was in class and I urinated and this brief leaked horribly! It was humiliating I was in the front row of my calculus lecture and I noticed a large wet spot on my shorts and t-shirt. Not only that, but when lecture was finally over and I attempted to bolt for the door I could feel the brief noticeably sagging.Also, this is not a product that was designed with comfort in mind, I was only in this brief for about 2 hours and it wasn't pleasant. It bunched and pinched A LOT!Basically, this product is NOT discreet, comfortable or effective and thanks to the sub-par design of this brief I have experienced one of the most humiliating events of my life."
2,i dont get it,"I struggled to finish this book, but i did. The story was weak and not believable. It is not a good travelogue. it is not a good mystery. it is not a good drama. I couldnt find myself rooting for or against any of the charachters. That, in my humble opinion, is a problem in a novel."
3,"Good, Not Great","I really liked the premise of this book. The vision the author lays out is very believable to me, I could see this really happening.I didn't care for his character development, I found it over done 'coming of age', but that's just me.Overall, a fun quick read, but nothing really special."
3,A Decent Yarn,I picked it up because it is a study in dynamic characters. It was referred to in Dynamic Characters by Kress.It is a teen-coming-of-age story set in the near future. The protagonist is a punk and gets himself thrown out of high school for being entirely too cute. He gets a second chance by signing up with Vanguard Mining- a company that mines asteroids.The story takes him from raw recruit to a trained and ready apprentice.
4,"Great book, great message","Concern over a ""right-wing"" message is excessive, I think. As far as I can tell, this series' purpose is to try to inspire the current generation of young teens to get a real education and try to _do_ something _real_. Considering the impact juvenile SF had in the 50s and 60s, and even on myself in the 70s and 80s, I applaud Sheffield, Pournelle, and the publisher for giving it a try."
3,"Good solid story, why the language?","I liked the book and was drawn by the title and'Booklist's' review comparing it to Heinlein's coming of age books. Wish the crude language was toned down tho. Coming at this as a teacher and fan of 'coming of age' books to use with my students, I really liked the jabs at the education system, the idea of taking learning and education in your own hands and growing up. Looking forward to the next one....but my hope is that you realize the book can stand on its own without that kind of language. It seems to be stuck in there 'because its a book for teens'. It will be fine without it."
1,Jerry Pournelle and Charles Sheffield don't mix,Stunk! Foul language & gratuitous violence ruined any chance of a decent story.Charles Sheffield on his own writes terrific stories.
1,pants !,"I loved charles sheffields book 'Godspeed Base', so I purchased this one, expecting more of the same. But alas, how dissapointed I was. All this book shows is that you should have sex at 16, should be dishonest, should not trust anyone, should be pessimistic etc, which are hardly the things for juvenile readers to read."
2,Mediocre,"This kind of book gives science fiction a bad name. A real yawner of a book, peopled with sterotypes instead of real characters. The plot is almost totally predictable (ok, there was one surprise), the science is old hat for anyone with a high school education, and who ever heard of a mining company being in the business of social reform? I think not. In any case, read ""Ender's Game"" for a much better treatment of a similar theme."
1,A Book To Miss,"As a Scotophile and history buff, I was looking forward to reading this new series-- and while the little character pictures are interesting, the first book itself was harder and harder slogging as the chapters piled up. The characters? Odd, and sometimes cartoonish; the dialogue? peculiar. I half-expected Edward I to twirl his mustachios and utter ""Muwahaha!"" before long.. so I stopped reading. It takes a great deal to make me lay aside a book, especially on one of my heroes-- but this one did it. It reads like a bad movie script, not a book on one of the crucial periods of Scottish history.Read the real thing:The Bruce Trilogy: A Superb Trilogy About Scotland's Greatest Hero (Coronet Books)'s Bruce trilogy, plus his bookThe Wallace: The Compelling 13th Century Story of William Wallace (Coronet Books)."
5,Fictionalized History - Well Written Story,"This book is well written, the characters literally come to life in your mind and you can't put it down. Reading the book becomes an obsession.Treatment of the historical ""Hero King"" and Scotland's Bravest that come to his side to fight for the free and independant Scotland that they have all hoped for stretches the historical thread to the breaking limit. Robert de Bruce is skillfully developed in the book, while some of his compatriots are dealt with poorly.The Bruces abilities and mental capabilities are kept in a strong historical context, while those who come to his call for aid are treated as if they were much lesser men, men that if he did not have, would prove his end.Well written story of the fabled ""Hero King"" of Scotland, it deserves a 5-Star rating. A MUST read book."
5,"Great Show From Their Peak,Still The Best.","Excellent,This was Tull in the '70's.Still my personal favorite music experience out there.My wife and I just took our vacation around the New York and Baltimore shows.Spent 4 nights in NYC at On The Ave.and 2 nights in Baltimore.Wonderful,can't wait to go to New York again."
4,Al final de la cima de éxito,"Debería darle menos estrellas al DVD porque de los 95 minutos sólo 50 son video, al comienzo y al final son imagenes mientras oyes los temas. Además las tomas de videos no son buenas, en muchos casos ocupan sólo una parte de la pantalla. (El sonido excelente pero las imagenes no)El grupo toca muy bien, francamente bien, es un buen concierto y representativo de su época dorada con la miembros clásicos de la banda. Se parace mucho al ""2LP Bursting Out"" pero aqui es mas corto.Si eres fan debes comprarlo aunque sea sólo por verles tocar Thick as a brick, Songs from the wood y otros temas clásicos de los 70.Este junto con el DVD de la Isla de Wight son los únicos publicados de su primera época (antes de los 80). ¡¡ Debía ser complicado grabar los conciertos !!. CDs piratas de los 70 hay bastantes pero DVD no."
3,A LITTLE MORE PLEASE,"WELL 50 MINUTES FROM A 2 HOUR CONCERT I GUESS I'M HAPPY BUT CANA LITTLE BIT MORE STUFF BE INCLUDED???LAWYERS I ASSUME. NOTICE NOT AN AA TV QUALITY; BUT VERY OKSOUND IS SUPER OK ,MORE PLEASE"
3,Die Hards Only,"Tull fan for a long time but this DVD is more a curio than must have. Very disjointed with concert video missing on a few songs then ends too soon on another. Included is 2nd CD of the same songs on DVD. Little odd. Audio only on Sweet Dream, the very hip, One Brown Mouse followed by over-rated Heavy Horses. Broadcast video begins with classic Thick as a Brick. Unfortunately, after an hour, video ends during Locomotive Breath! Hello?Audio only for Too Old to Rock and Roll, My God and Cross Eyed Mary. Interesting for a couple of reasons: this was a very early satellite broadcast so time ran out during the concert. Tony Williams filled in short notice for John Glascok on Bass and finally, Uriah Heep opened this show! Would be nice to see the whole concert. Better option is Tull's Isle of Wight. That's classic!"
2,A Designer DVD,"Over $25 for a DVD/CD combo that only has 32% (=8*100/25) of the numbers that are actually video.I have seen most of the other DVDs from J Tull and there is almost nothing new in these videos so for me only 8% of the material was new concert video-wise.On top of that the two very amazing songs ""Heavy Horses"" and ""One Brown Mouse"" were disappointingly not video. This is a very strange DVD that begins with two ""Audio Only Songs"", and then goes into 8 Videos, whch again is followed by three Audio Only songs. Then after that is the CD with 11 songs.What the hell did I just buy?"
2,Very Brief Video,"I am a long time Tull fan, saw them live in 1976. However, there is no justification for the price to minutes ratio of this DVD. The point of a DVD is having video with the performance, not just random still photos over the music. Of the so-called run time of 95 minutes in the DVD description, only about half is actual live footage. No real complaints about the footage included, except that the video ends abruptly during an extended encore riff on Locomotive Breath. Very unsatisfying."
3,Jethro Tull - CD great; DVD awful,"I purchased this for my husband for Christmas. Come to find out, the DVD only has pictures...it is NOT a concert. If I would've known this, I wouldn't have purchased this item. The CD is very good, but who would want to pay extra for a DVD that only shows 1 picture for each song and has the same songs as the CD? Very disappointed. If you are looking for a Jethro Tull concert, DO NOT buy this!"
3,"Alot like ""Bursting Out""","For a second I thought is was the same concert, if you have ""Bursting Out"" already I'd say you could pass on MSG."
1,Won't get ripped again!,"I was sixteen years old when I went to Madison Square Garden to see my favorite band, Jethro Tull, in November 1978. I had lousy seats but I didn't care - until the show started and the sound was so bad, the sections around mine started chanting, ""We can't hear!""At the beginning of the show it was announced (I don't remember by whom) that the show was being broadcast in England and I thought, ""Great, it's GOT to be a good show."" I was wrong. The set list was okay but the whole show was an hour long, no encores, AND for some reason they did Aqualung twice!Those tickets must have cost me 6, maybe 8 dollars, times two for my girlfriend, plus train fare and a couple of joints, comes to a total of about 20 bucks.I will not be paying for this show again!"
4,"very good, but not enough of dvd concert.","i realy do not have anything bad to say about this dvd. everything is very good;quality,sound.....but unfortunately dvd concert is third of the whole dvd....i wish it would be more....."
5,Great classic document,"This video captures a very good Tull performance; super-good version of early- and mid-seventies classics, which is always a pleasure to see, since the ""Living with the Past"" (LWTP) DVD has a mediocre sound and way-too-cheesy video editing for being released after the year 2000. The Live @ Montreux DVD and the AVO Sessions DVD are far better than LWTP. So if you are looking for digital recoding-quality video, and don't care about Ian's voice, I'd recommend those two with emphasis on the latter.The sound and picture of ""Jethro Tull: Live at Madison Square Garden 1978"" are very good for the time it was recorded. Don't expect digital quality because of course this was recorded on analog equipment.A must have for every Jethro Tull fan.I'm so looking forward for the official release of the Tampa Stadium 1976 and the London Hippodrome 1977 which share similar video and audio quality than this video who has been circulating before on bootlegging circles for quite a while."
4,"Excellent, high-powered receiver, flawed","The DA555ES does everything brilliantly, especially considering that it can be had over the 'Net for $680, a full $319 below retail. Only reservation so far: the two-way remote takes more than it gives. It self-cancels at awkward moments, needs both of your hands to operate, is heavy, takes up too much space, and once you get past the ititial set-up phase provides a pile of features that you don't really need. But in terms of providing brilliant sound (especially with Digital Dolby DVDs) I've found--or heard-- nothing better."
5,"Excellent piece of equipment, silly remote control","This thing sounds great, I am constantly impressed with the sound quality and surround sound effects. The ""concert hall"" and ""live"" music settings are very realistic, unlike many I have heard. I wish there was some way to turn all those glaring LED's off so it's not so bright and distracting when watching movies in the dark. Also, some kind of ""midnight"" mode, automatic loudness -inhibiting function would keep my roommates in the next room from having to listen to all the cool explosion scenes with me in the middle of the night. The ""universal"" remote will not recognize my JVC television, but it does turn on my Sony shelf system every time I use the main power button to turn the reciever off! But it's worth a minor inconvenience to experience such wonderful sound quality."
4,Like everything except the two-handed overly complicated remote !,"I bought one of these when they first came out to run the my mains out the pre-amp outputs to my Bose 901 EQ and then to my Carver 450W / ch Amp. It has always worked just fine. I have always been ( and so are friends ) impressed with the overall sound of my system. The two-handed remote with the big LCD screen ( Slammed in my ease of Use rating ) was always goofy but functional so - I dealt with it ! I never changed much after I set it up so remote was only for on/off, volume and input switching.I believe it has to be over 10 years old by now and it still functions fine. Just got a Harmony One Remote, that should cure the goofy remote it came with."
1,Broken,"The unit completely does not function except to turn on and off. Sound is a pretty big priority for a Sony 7.1 dolby reciever. Do not by from this vendor. How do I achieve compensation for a big heavy metal paper weight? Please tell me, honestly."
3,What was the purpose?,"I don't exactly disagree with the previous review. But the reason for this collection is perplexing. Just two years before, Rhino itself put out a more expansive collection of Warwick's greatest hits, Dionne Warwick Collection: Her All-Time Greatest Hits, which includes EVERY song here PLUS eight more. And at the time of this writing, that collection is available new for less than one-tenth the price of this one. Be sure to compare if you are thinking of buying this item for some reason."
3,broken,"The pearls looked nice and my daughter loved them, but the clasp broke while she was wearing them and luckily noticed that it had broken and the necklace had fallen off. These were purchased for her to wear in her wedding now we have to take the time to get it repaired before the wedding."
4,I enjoyed these old fashioned stories of love and innocence,"Penny Jordan has done it again ... using her tried and true formula of innocent virgins and mean but misunderstood leading men! The first story "" Loving"" is about Jay Fraser and Claire. It begins with a friendship between their two young daughters and soon blossoms into much more... The second - ""Injured Innocent"" tells of Lissa and Joel. When their married brother and sister are killed in a plane crash, Lissa and Joel are given joint custody of their neices .... the battles only begin there!! The last story ""The six month marriage"" tells of ex husband and wife Blake and Saffire. After several years of separation, they get remarry on a temporary basis when Saffire discovers her elderly father is dying. If you enjoy Penny Jordan, you will be sure to love these three classic Jordan romances"
5,Great Game,"This game is really fun. You have to catch fish and sell them to buy better fishing supplies, while looking for a magic fish. You can even take care of a pet fish. I played for 5 hrs. last night and now my daughter is playing. The more I played the game the more I liked it!"
3,A mixed review...,"I really wanted to like this game -- it has a lot of creativity and is a cool premise, in both its halves. I'm not sure it's a success, though. My 9-year-old got it for Christmas, and despite good eye-hand coordination, reasoning skills, AND reading the directions, neither of us can get it to work. There's space to save 2 games so we're both trying it, and neither of us can catch even one fish! Demoralizing. Plus, now my daughter's run out of money to buy bait, so she's not sure she can continue. There seems to be some secret to reeling the fish in, but we haven't caught on (no pun intended). The graphics are very good, and the story seems to progress in a clever way, but it can be a rough go at the start. With luck and perseverence, we may succeed, but it's definitely more involved and not as rewarding initially than Pokemon. I wouldn't recommend it for a child who's not willing to work really hard -- it'd be too easy to give up."
2,If you don't get it; he won't explain it,"This book does not offer a step by step explanation of its problems. If you don't get it; he doesn't explain how to solve the problem. He doesn't understand that writing out the answer is not teaching you how to solve the problem. He doesn't tell you why he does what he does to solve the problem. He just solves the problem and hopes you figure out what he's done. Personally, I'm not that good at math."
3,"Looked promising, but ...","I bought this because the Table of Contents had a lot of applications I was interested in. But, I am part way through Chapter 2 (basic stuff, so far) and have found enough math errors that I feel I can't trust the more advanced material. I agree with the previous reviewer that the solutions are a bit hard to follow, and thus don't teach well sometimes. I did like the quality and layout of the book, though."
4,Good but not great,I usually enjoy Janet Quin-Harkin books but this book was pretty good execpt I didn't like how it ended. I like that Rick broke up with Joanna because of their bad tempers and then went out with Angie. And the ending was how do you say a little corny.
3,Eliza Soundtrack,"Was pleased with service, delivery and price of the product. Have not opened because it is a gift for my daughter for an April date. This is CD she's has looked for for some time. So still not sure of the condition. Will know on April 12."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS IF YOU WANT 'FRIENDS IN LOW PLACES',"Amazon sent me the wrong CD two times!. And, Amazon has not changed the order yet, and it has been months! I ordered the country CD, Friends in Low Places, Dwight Yoakum, I believe.I sent many emails and they refule to change the ordering number/name.Plus, I can't order the CD I want because they won't change their database."
2,Doesn't dig real deep,"This book is very simplistic. It doesn't give any real answers. It gives simplistic solutions such as ""Have a better ethics program in business school""The author has used this book as an opportunity to demonstate his love for the Republican party. He doesn't seem to have any fortune 500 business consulting experience.The fact that most reviewers are from Wisconsin(just like the author) tells me that most of the reviews are from friends of his."
4,Good to Go,"I got them when they started going down in price. First they are value for money even at the top end price. They came out the box and onto my feet and out for a banquet the next evening. They are pretty high but not an uncomfortable high as they heel is well placed under the shoe. I have a narrow to medium width foot and they fit snuggly into the shoe. However, I can see if you are too narrow it could be a risk. The reason I did not get the shoe a 5.... Pelle has to start indicating when a shoe runs a size small that one should buy up. I took a chance and got the size 13M for my normal size 12M and got a great fit. I like what Linea Paoloa does with their shoes they tell you if a particualr style of their shoe is going to run small. Pelle Moda has to do the same."
4,Beautiful Shoes,These shoes are comfortable and beautiful. Wore them to a club and able to dance effortlessly in them. A great value for my money.
1,Lame and not at all funny,"I really didn't like this book. It seems to me that the author thinks he's really funny or clever, but in my opinion, he is neither. It's really just a collection of articles from his column which is published in the Miami Herald and many other newspapers. None of what I read was anywhere near ""Pulitzer Prize"" winning content, but apparently he was awarded one at some point in time. Don't waste your time with this one."
3,Not His Best Collection,"Whilst From Mars and Venus certainly isn't Barry's best work it is not at the bottom of the list either. Published in 1997 it is rather dated in parts but a lot of the topics are still extremely relevant today. Barry has included photographs as well in this book which he doesn't always do, which are quite funny. In From Mars and Venus Barry covers topics such as synchronised swimming, laser tag, gravity, fashion tips for men, snowmobiles, snowboarding, dog sledding, Wheel of Fortune, Harley Davidson jerks, Classical Music, playing the part of a corpse in an Opera, Hilary Clinton asking him to lunch then declining because he wouldn't do it off the record, going on Oprah, annoying commercials and Florida drivers to name just a few. Definitely check out other non fiction collections such as Boogers are My Beat as well as his sensational fiction novels especially Tricky Business."
4,"Good, clear reading","Ormnandy's conducting is straightforward and clear. There is no particular character or depth in it, but if you are going to listen for the first time to this piece, go ahead. It is balanced and clear, but it stands second to the outstanding readings of Stokowski or even Reiner."
3,Do me a favor... try the Reiner.,"I'm a bit disappointed. I listened a couple of weeks ago to the full-length score by someone else on the radio but failed to note who was presenting. It was fabulous. Now I have bought the Ormandy/Philly and, as stated, found it not up to my expectations. Many years back in my youth I was highly bias toward the Philadelphia and EO in just about everything... loved them, in fact. That's why this was such a disappointment. First of all, I think the technical recording leaves a lot to be desired, even considering the date this was done. But musically, many of the passages as played differently from all the other performances I've heard... and not to the betterment. I'm guessing I should have stuck with my initial inclination (which for one reason or another I abandoned) and selected the Reiner/Chicago. Most of the reviews I read pointed me in that direction, but I was too stubborn to follow a clue!"
5,Aglow with angelic goodness!,"A sparkling gem of a story that transcends season and settings! From the first page, COME MY LITTLE ANGEL tugged at my heartstrings, drawing me into young Daisy's magical world, infusing me with her unwavering hope. A timeless classic!"
3,Your average law scool casebook on community property,"This is your average law school textbook. For the layman (and sometimes even for the seasoned law student) legal cases can be hard to understand. Sometimes the notes at the end of the cases help, but sometimes they don't.While all cases are going to contain the structure and verbiage of ""legalese,"" some books do a better job than others. This book is about par for the course. If you would like to see an example of an above average legal textbook, check out Constitutional Criminal Procedure by Lexis.I used Aspen publishers' casenote book to help me along in understanding the cases in this book. I have a review that highly recommends that casenote book."
4,The Best?,"Although I did enjoy this book it was far from the ""best"" erotica I have read. I'm not sure who rated it the best, but they apparently havent read books like ""Bedtime Stories for Women"" by Nancy Madore, which is fairy tale stories that have been combined with women's fantasies, or ""Hers"" which is a series of sensual stories written with women in mind, or even ""Forbidden Flowers"" which are real fantasies written by the women who dreamed them up. The stories in this book were tepid at best when compared to the books I have mentioned here, which are super sensual and exciting."
5,Poems about seeking a soul mate and hope!,"This soft cover book, containing a series of poems about longing for a soul mate, hope, love, affection and of subsequent betrayal by men in general, is richly illustrated with photographs and drawings. Ms. Pala, is a Hungarian born, well traveled woman, who presently resides in Toronto, Canada, wrote all the poems and took all the photographs. Her writing style is different enough to be interesting, and most of the situations are based upon her personal experiences and her own self discovery about life, love and its many challenges. One of my favorite poems from this book is titled: Canadian men, which also would apply to American men in general. Buy this book, you will not be disappointed."
2,Questionable genealogical research,"Mrs. Brandenburg makes some assumptions about the early Duke family of James City County, VA that seem to be off the mark & not in keeping with the historical record. I question her interpretation of the historical record."
4,I think it helps,"Did a lot of research on wound care when my husband came home with a non healing rectal wound.Amerigel had very good feedback. I bought the saline, and call it my ""saline with the extra ingredient."" I am doing absolutely everything I can to get my husband to heal and it seems to be working. Can't tell you which aspect of what I am doing/giving him is working, but I can tell you that Amerigel has the most wonderful wound care nurse who will take great care to help you. So if you have a wound that's not healing, give it a try."
4,"Fascinating, engaging story","If you enjoy reading historical adventure novels/narratives you'll certainly enjoy Cities of Gold! Even the modern-day story that runs parallel to the author's vivid retelling of the quest for the legendary Seven Cities of Cibola is worth reading (albeit it's not as interesting as the actual quest). If you have any interest in learning more about the history of Mexico and the American Southwest, this book is for you! Enjoy!"
5,Beautiful music,"As a former music student and teacher I was very interested in these CDs recommended to me by an on-line friend. I went ahead and ordered them out of curiosity, and didn't regret it at all. The cats and dog love it, I love it, and I wish I had had this music to play for my daughter when she was still a baby. It is very soothing for animals and humans alike. My favourite is the Natural Rhythms one."
5,I didn't believe you. It works!,"I saw this product in a pet store and decided to go online to read the online reviews of the product before I actually bought it. All the reviews were surprisingly positive so I figured I'd try it - why not? At least, I could listen to it and relax even if the animals didn't. Well! My two dogs (a shep mix and an akita mix) and the two cats were actually listening and then they went to sleep! It really did calm them down!"
4,Two Paws Up!,"Great music. Very relaxing. Duncan, the coolest dog in North America, loves the Natural Rhythms CD."
2,Weak,"This session was not released earlier, as Alfred Lion had judged it to be less than what Green was capable of. In short, he called it right.For jazz guitarists and other fans of Green, you may want to buy this disc anyway: While not polished, the solos are good. Moreover, they're easy to deconstruct if you want to see just what Green was thinking over the changes.If you're just now discovering Grant Green, there are several other excellent albums to begin with. An excellent CD which also features recently re-discovered content is Standards."
3,don't see it!,"i don't see what all the hype is about, it's quite average production, and while Jean got a great flow on her, she packs rarely more than one rhyme a line, ussually only including 2 or 3 per paragraph, and her rhymeing words themselves are ussually off, single syllable, and very simplistic. she tries to hard to be conscious and it's just comes off as phony and preachy.Its easy to say your the best and tell everyone to lift their game, but to show them a better game to reach is something jean is yet to do.peace,"
1,I couldn't test my product because I did not receive it,"I purchased 2 different types of polishing cloths.One I could test because I got the delivery. The product does not last very long; it works very well for 3 o 4 polishings.The other polishing cloth which I should have received from Something Silver, did not arrive because UPS had problems on the way. TO my understanding SS did not handle the problem as I would have expected."
4,"Well, Hayley's in it","This is a watchable movie. I suppose a comedy.I must admit that the main reason I bought it was to see Hayley Mills again. It was worth the price just for that.With a plot? that mixes the internet and old crime, Frank and Josh find themselves fronting for gangsters. Or do they?Andrew McCarthy fans will want it.Robert Vaughn and Hayley Mills play Frank's Dad and Mom."
2,No software!,"I've had this book for a week now and I would love to be able to give a knowledgeable review but I can't get past the second chapter.Why? The second chapter details setting up the SDK but after many hours of searching I can't find anyplace to download it. It uses the first (November 2003) release of the J2EE SDK and there have been 3 updates since then. The current release uses an entirely different database with an extensively updated web server.I'm looking to familiarize myself with J2EE 1.4 and this appears to be a very good book for that, but it's going to be a major pain when I'm forced to use different software."
4,Good introduction,"I was taking a college course using Wrox press pro to pro series book on J2EE and it was kicking my butt. I purchased this book and it was invaluable in breaking down concepts in an easy to understand manner. The book is well written and a great introductory text to J2EE, I highly recommend it for anyone trying to learn this technology."
1,Poor Quality,Poor quality - chopped up clips; not complete matches. Totally dissatisfied with this DVD which was purchased as a birthday gift for my son. We wasted money on this purchase.
2,Who edited Man or Machine?,"I just bought this video. I'm a big Tyson fan especially early in his career. Hence, I was excited to receive this package. Once I opened it and played the video, I was dismayed with the editing of it. I was told that the fights were in there ""entirety"". This is entirely not true. The fights are broken, cut, & pasted. There seems to be no skill in this because sometimes when the fighters are mixing it up, the DVD skips to 10 seconds later. There are no interviews which is a part of the fight I like and no previews, which I use to like on HBO. But what really hurts the quality is that the fights are not complete. This in itself hurts this collection of videos as a ""collectors piece"" because their not originial in any sense of the word..."
2,A Word of Caution,"This seems to be a good basic resource for the students exploring the world of DSM-IV-TR. It was published by the same house who publishes DSM etc., but look on page 4. Mental retardation is coded on Axis I! As of today I was unable to explain why, hence I assume it is a cardinal mistake/typo, which unfortunately cannot be tolerated in any diagnosis book."
3,It's just okay,"I purchased this book to use during some clinical supervision sessions to study and practice differential diagnosing. This book does not have a great discussion section after the case vignette to explain the diagnoses given. The vignette either has no discussion at all or it is very brief, not going into much detail at all. You could probably find something better"
5,The quickest good read in print,"A very satisfying read, love, mystery, relationnship issues; all in a fast paced slice of life book, I look forward to more Mick Hart mysteries"
3,Listen to the radio,"I enjoy most of the songs on the cd. I don't have it, but know every song and it's basically what a Top 40 or Popular music channel would play. I think it's useless to buy these cd's when they come out because the music is overplayed at the time. Buy it in a year or two. The D- rating (from Above poster)for NSync and Nelly is ridiculous. Although the radio did and still does play this remix a lot, doesn't mean it isn't good anymore (that is if you like N Sync and their music)."
4,Now 10,"Although this isn't a great cd it is still worth a listen. ""Now 10,"" is the same formula pop, rock, and ballads. Some tracks are a bit bland like the played out , ""How You Remind me"" and the R&B remix ""I'm Gonna Be Alright."" And some tracks are great like ""Overprotected"" and ""Don't Say Goodbye."" Now 10 is alright if you wanna buy a cd of Top 40 hits.Tracks For Now 11:Britney Spears - ""Boys""Eminem - ""Cleaning Out My Closet""Kylie Minogue - ""Love at First Sight""3LW - ""I Do""DJ Sammy - ""Heaven""Nelly - ""Hot in Herre"""
2,SALES.....ARE.....DROPPING!,"I would say that this cd is okay but the cover is uhhh! The songs are not really good at all, but sometimes good to listen to. Now 10 is my 2nd worst Now in front of Now 5."
4,NOW 10 ..... yah,Its a good cd - i didnt buy it but i burned it on my computer its okay - some of the songs ive never heard of but that okay cause i like some of em' ! keep it up NOW!!Ash
2,Britney's gotta go,"From the music I see listed on this CD, I can tell that:A. The people who arranged this CD don't listen to the radio - at least not often enoughB. Britney Spears and a few other people/groups who shouldn't be on the CD have been ""bribing"" their way onto itC. That I don't know anything about popular music and that the stuff on the NOW 10 CD is actually the hits of today.(which, I seriously doubt)OR....D. That it's just a badly arranged CD, composed by apes (who did the best they could, I'm sure)Take your pick.They really need to improve the selections on their CDs - I doubt that anyone's expecting much from them at the moment."
3,"OK,Here's a list for NOW 11",1.Barenaked-Jennifer Love Hewitt2.I Need A Girl-P.Diddy feat.Usher and Loon3.Soak Up The Sun-Sheryl Crow4.Complicated (or Sk8er Boi)-Avril Lavigne5.Just A Friend 2002-Mario6.Heaven-DJ Sammy featuring Yanou7.Without Me-Eminem8.Boom-P.O.D.9.Love At First Sight-Kylie Minogue10.Ordinary Day-Vanessa Carlton11.Gangsta Lovin-Eve feat.Alicia Keys12.Objection-Shakira13.Don't Turn Off The Lights-Enrique Iglesias14.Cleaning Out My Closet-Eminem15.Hot In Herre-Nelly16.Just Like A Pill-Pink17.Adrienne-The Calling18.Feel It Boy-Beenie Man featuring Janet Jackson
1,NOW is going down the drain...,"I thought the NOW series was all about variety! Not anymore. I can only find 2, possibly 3 songs on this cd that I like. Now I realize that i don't have the same taste in music as everyone else, but come on aren't you people getting sick of Britney? And they keep putting the same kind of music on these CDs anymore. Now 8 was good and so was Now 4 but as for the rest..."
2,Now Thats What I Call Boring,"This has got to stop! Anybody who wants to hear this music can turn on their radio and hear it. Why bother to waste money on this. Its cheaper to download it. Maybe we should count ourselves as lucky, they are up to Now 52 in the UK."
4,Now 10 with Britney,Here are the song by song reviews of the album1.Overprotected-This was okay 7/102.Can't get you out of my head-Great 10/103.Escape-Enrique Inglesias is actually a good singer who knew 95.Girlfiend-Black N'Sync & White Nelly 7/106.Im gonna be alright-Never heard Remix it is Nas 10/108.Move it like this-I liked this one for real 9/109.More then a women-Why did she die 10/1010.Uh Huh-There one good song ands it awesome 10/1011.Always on time-Why does she call her self the Princess 8/1012.Sugar High-Was okay 7/1013.Halfcrazy-Probaly and 8/1014.Underneath your clothes-I was 8/1015.A Thousand Miles-Great Great for real 10/10 she was like 1716.A New Day has come-I will be killed greatest voice ever 10/1017.We were always made of stars-he is wierd this is good 9/1018.First Date-Not there follow up 7/1019.Stillness of Heart-Pretty Good 8/1020.How you remind me-this one is pretty great 9/10146 out of 180 wich means it gets 4 stars
1,Altogether Mind-numbing,"Here we have urban, Latin-heartthrob, boy-band, techno, alternative rock, and whatever Britney Spears is or isn't. There is casual swearing in this booklet, with photos of Paulina Rubio and J. Lo. There is no sentiment, other than that which is so vapid that a catchy beat and an underdressed singer can't sell it by the millions. This is mind-numbing - catchy, cute, and spacey, and everything else."
3,this could be a better C.D.,"Most of the songs are O.K. But they should have more songs. This is what I thing they should have on Now 11.1. Complicated - Avril Langive2. Just Like A Pill - Pink3. Gangsta Lovin' - Eve4. Hot In Herre (or Dilemma) - Nelly5. The Middle - Jimmy Eat World6. (one of these eminem songs (cleaning out my closet, buisness, halile's song, or without me)7. Heaven - D.J. Sammy & Yanou8. Just a Friend - MarioI love the now series. I have every one. But Now 11 should be a good one. The release date for now 11 is middle/late November"
2,S'ok,"Teen pop: Tracks 1, 2, 15.Latin pop: Tracks 3, 4.Hip-hop/rap: Tracks 5, 6, 10, 11.Piece of crap worthless childish one-hit wonder garbage: Tracks 7, 8, 12.R&B;: Tracks 9, 13.Slow pop ballads: Tracks 14, 16, 19.Rock: Tracks 18, 20.I have no f***ing idea: Track 17."
2,Meh. Just meh.,"You can tell Phil's getting older, as are most of his bandmates. The music on this disc lacks energy and cohesion. Compared to Diamond Head, Southern Cross or Impossible Guitar, 6PM is a snoozer. I can't pick a standout track because there are none. The guitar work is disappointingly pedestrian compared to his usual innovative standard. Even the sit-in with David Gilmour falls flat (then again, he's getting old too). I would try to check out a couple of MP3s on amazon or iTunes before I considered getting the whole disc. Old musicians never die, they just fade away..."
1,Newco OCS-12 Short Life Span,"I was very interested in having a coffee maker that used 200 degree water to brew coffee and the Newco OC-12 seemed to be quite the favorite. I bought it and used it for about three months. Then it started leaking water while brewing and would puddle under the burner where the electric circuits are and was afraid to use it after that (electrical shock, fire, etc). When I contacted Newco they made it sound like it was my fault it didn't work and recommended that I fix it. Long story short, for that kind of money their customer service and products are woefully inadequate."
4,Best coffee so far....,"I love the taste of the fresh ground coffee in this brewer. The coffee is hot and the brew is quick. The carafe keeps the coffee hot and it stays fresh longer than past coffee carafes used in the past. I like the size of the brew also, 12 cups is great. I have had this brewer for months now with no problems, leaks etc. It is easy to clean and load. The cord is heavy duty. Drawbacks are: it is loud when brewing and the pour is slow and somewhat difficult for friends and family who are not used to it. People keep asking how do turn the top to pour! I would have liked to have a timer to post pone a brew from time to time. Otherwise I do recommend this one!"
4,I would buy it again.,"It makes great coffee; for taste and tempeture, it's a five star coffee maker. But it's a little loud when it makes coffee, and it doesn't have a stop drip function, so you have to wait for all of the coffee to be brewed before you can enjoy your great coffee."
1,Packing is crap,"When the box arrived, it was falling apart. There was a hole in the boutin of box where one of the casters poked through before it was broken off. If it want for the fact that it weighs 70pounds and shopping is ungodly, I would have sent it back.buying a new caster was cheaper. I learned my lesson"
4,"good size, good value, good flavor, but sandy!","these 1/4 inch chunks of dried mushrooms pack a great deal of flavor. the photograph is not really accurate, at least for my batch--mine were more consistently sized and larger than the shreds that are depicted.i have bought many packages of whole porcinis at much higher prices, and the quality of these nuggets is roughly the same. the mushrooms are of good, consistent quality--i've not encountered any dark, crinkly, off-flavored pieces in the package (typical for inexpensive porcini).they've worked well in the recipes i've used them in. one complaint: i cannot seem to get all the grit out, no matter how many times i strain, sieve, soak. that's true of some much more expensive mushrooms, so not a deal killer for me. it's hardly noticeable."
2,frustrating,"The trucks do handle like a monster truck would but it gets REALLY annoying. It's hard to figure out where the track is. The whole time we were just going around in circles not knowing how to get back on course. The summit battle is fun though, that is the only part we play on the game."
2,Game is slow,The game seems way too slow. Idk what about it makes it so slow. Maybe its the handling on the monster trucks or just the fact that it's an older game and things like turning your vehicle or even accelerating are below average. This game seems better suited for a PC.
4,Good physics make this a fun game,"This game gives you the feeling of driving a monster truck in the same way that Wave Race gave you the feeling of driving a jet ski. While this game is not as awesome as Wave Race, I enjoyed it for the same reasons. It takes time to master the skills required to drive the trucks (there are many available, all modeled after real-life monster trucks.) There is a cool 'king of the mountain' game. I'm glad I bought this game."
1,Terrible game,"I rented this game thinking this would be the best game ever. Boy was I wrong. 'Monster Truck Madness 64' stinks. It has very little options, and even though there are five or six multiplayer options, they are all the same thing and they are boring. The controls are terrible, the 1-player is even more terrible than the contols, and the main menu is the most terrible thing of all. I'm suprised this game was even made, it's so terrible. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! If you buy it, you'll 100% regret buying it. DO NOT BUY. EVER."
4,It's great you can do what you want!,It's fun and your free on your own! It takes a little bit to master though.
4,what about the trubrite screen?,"Ok this is technically reallly a nice machine and looks great.What about the screen though? Am I the only one with this problem? The lower corners are freaking darker than the rest of the screen. I returned the laptop for this, and guess what, the next one had exactly the same problem, and even the store's show model had it a bit. So maybe their whole batch was bad. I couldn't find diddlysquat on the internet on this. I think it is a trubrite issue it seems the screen foil has been squeezed in too tightly around the corners making the lighting uneven.Is everybody else happy with this? I'm not."
2,"Problems with Touchpad, Keyboard, and USB ports after one month - Toshiba refuses to replace","I have owned a Toshiba M45-S359 for one month. There are two major problems. In the first week, I noticed the USB ports would stop working if the computer went into sleep mode. Because this is my business machine, I disabled sleep mode and continued using the computer. One month later, the mouse touchpad has failed. I believe the problem occurs when the computer reaches a certain temperature. I contacted Toshiba for a replacement. They refused. The computer is one month old an under warranty.I am an attorney and thinking about filing a class action on behalf of m45-s359 owners. If you have similar problems, please email me at m45s359complaints@hotmail.com. Please provide you name, address, phone, date of purchase, and problem."

4,Foundation - Background Readings,"You can learn more on Lanchester Strategy and in particular the mathematical basis of the warfare strategy in businessn based on Lanchesters equations of combat in books by Shinichi Yano, Dr Taoka, Dr Onoda and F. W. Lanchester by searching these names on the Amazon book site...regards"
2,Cassman,"For some reason thought this was the ""newer"" version of the Cops series not soemthing from the 1950's."
3,Warren Oates as Dillinger!,I thought this was a very entertaining movie. It wasn't quite up to Bonnie and Clyde but it was close. It also wasn't historically accurate in all occassions but it was still a good movie. The acting was aslo very good. Warren Oates shines as Dillinger and there are many familiar faces like Harry Dean Stanton and others that fill out the cast nicely. This movie is very violent but so is the subject matter so it might not be for everybody but I recommend it.
4,Good,"This was a gift for someone else, and I haven't heard if they 'love' it or not. I'm assuming they like the movie and have watched it at least once."
3,Cardboard Hoods,"Despite the presence of an impressive cast(Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Michelle Philips, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Dreyfus)director John Milius does not so much concern himself with characterization but with staging gun battles. I will give him this much that the gun battles are pretty impressive and he does evoke the period pretty well with the antique cars and art direction. About the only idea Milius seems to present with any veracity is that the FBI, in this case in the person of Melvin Purvis(Johnson), were shameless grandstanders whose pursuit of gangsters was not so much for the public welfare but for personal glory and that point is beaten into the ground. Not a complete waste of time but this film made me long for ""Bonnie and Clyde""."
4,Warren Oates IS Dillinger,"This is one of the fastest moving movies you're likely to ever see. Warren Oates was the only man to play the part of John Dillinger (he even looks like him). When Harry Dean Stanton says ""things aren't workin' out for me today"", you gotta laugh. Whether it's romanticized or not, who cares. It's a fun movie to watch and if you like to see lots of spent brass flyin', you'll love it. My only 2 regrets are that it's not on DVD and that it's recorded in the LP mode on the VHS."
4,Very good 70s period piece,"""Dillinger"" is not a particularly well-known movie, but it stands up well against other 1970s movies that explored the 1930s (Paper Moon, Bonnie & Clyde). Warren Oates stars as the notorious bank robber, John Dillinger. Oates is a great character actor and its terrific to see him in a starring role. Why he did not become a bigger star is a mystery. The movie does a great job capturing the barren depression-era Midwest. Real-life news reels are mixed in with the action to help make it more authentic.The supporting cast is also fantastic. Harry Dean Stanton is quite funny and Steve Kanaly (later a star of ""Dallas"") has one of his best movie roles as Pretty Boy Floyd. This is probably the best movie that director John Milius has made (he later made ""Conan the Barbarian"" and ""Red Dawn""). The movie is fast-paced and fun. What is lacks in historic accuracy it more than makes up for with non-stop action. The DVD doesn't have any extras, but I still recommend it."
5,MUST SEE,"The best Dillinger movie of all time and one of the best, if not the best shoot-out scenes of any movie. Believe me I know because I'm a Vietnam combat veteran"
4,dillinger - the movie!,"Obviously meant to cash in on the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" craze, this isn't really a bad film, in spite of a few liberties taken by the production company. To illustrate: the phrase ""Don't shoot, G-Men!"" attributed to George ""Machine Gun"" Kelly is pure fiction, as is his capture by Melvin Purvis. What Kelly really said was ""I've been expecting you"" as he was apprehended by Memphis police. On the other hand, Warren Oates makes a convincing Dillinger, and in fact was the only actor ever to play the part who actually resembled the outlaw. Also, the execution-style end of ""Pretty Boy"" Floyd is reasonably accurate. Overall, a pretty good film, well acted and well cast. I liked it."
4,Dillinger - with Warren Oates,"As a fellow historian and Author of the forthcoming book, ""Dillinger, The Hidden Truth,"" I'd have to say: This movie was extremely well made. The movie is truly a classic, very adventurous, and realisticly portrayed. I highly recommend this movie to everyone! I give the actors and cast five stars, but I can only give the movie a 4-star rating due to the lack of historical accuracy. The movie is based on many actual events, but the characters are incorrectly placed, and somewhat over dramatized by the true Hollywood tradition."
4,WHAT'S IT ABOUT? FROM BACK-COVER:,"IN MAY 1979 RON SMITH, A FORMER LEEDS POLICEMAN, RECEIVED A PHONE-CALL TO SAY HIS 23YO DAUGHTER HELEN, A NURSE WORKING IN SAUDI ARABIA, WAS DEAD. SHE HAD FALLEN BY ACCIDENT, THE BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE TOLD HIM, FROM A SIXTH-FLOOR BALCONY DURING A PARTY GIVEN BY A BRITISH COUPLE, THE ARNOTS.BUT ON TWO TRIPS TO JEDDAH, AND AFTER THREE POST-MORTEMS ON HIS DAUGHTER'S BODY, MUCH MORE EXPLANATION THAN SUSTAINED IT. AS TIME WENT ON, RON SMITH BECAME MORE AND MORE CERTAIN THAT HELEN HAD BEEN MURDERED.THIS IS THE STORY OF RON SMITH'S SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER, ABOUT HIS PERSISTANT FIGHT WITH OFFICIALDOM BOTH IN UK AND SAUDI ARABIA. IT SHOWS HOW THE SIMPLE PRIORITIES OF HIS SEARCH BECAME EMBROILED IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICS, AND WERE DEFLECTED BY THEM."
4,it was pretty good,This book was a pretty good book! they never really even told u about the person in the attic till the end of the book! SOOOOOOOOOO exciting?! :) ok bye!
4,Cute...,"This is a really cute product! My daughter saw a Chia pet commercial around Christmas time and wanted it...I found these on Amazon and thought they would be a better choice for my 4 year old. So the Easter bunny left a couple of these for my two kids. We watered the little critter, as per instructions, but the grass never grew in all the way...a little pricey to not work. It's still really a cute little thing and we are going to empty it and grow our own grass in it..."
4,cute and fun for the kids to interact with,Wife bought this and others as well and we love it. It's nice having the kids interact with it and seeing the grass grow. My wife has even braided with of the Nyokki characters!
4,"The Pixies Three ""Our History""","A good overview of what most probably constitutes the entire career of The Pixies Three. The earliest material sounds as if you're listening to an old transistor radio but that doesn't detract from the charm of the harmonies. Once we arrive at ""Birthday Party"" the production values are vastly improved and there's no place on Earth I'd rather spend an afternoon at then ""442 Glenwood Ave."" Once the party theme had proved successful the girls pretty much rehash it in various ways, some quite good, others less so. ""Gee"" is a particular standout. Nobody does this type of material anymore and quite frankly I don't believe they ever will. If you're tired of heavy breathing divas and ""cookie cutter cuties"" churning out pop/rock/country/r&b hybrids then I strongly recommend this CD. A breath of fresh air from the past."
3,A good book for beginners and advanced aquarists alike,"This is an anthology of articles in ADI, Tetra's German magazine. The different groups of catfishes and loaches are identified and given a broad treatment. Most groups are represented, including rarer ones like doradids, hillstream loaches,and pelagic catfishes. Includes articles on spawning clown loaches, corydoras pygmaeus, ancistrus dolichopterus, hoplosternum sp., and hypostomus punctatus. The book ""Hobbyist Guide to Catfish and Loaches"" is an expanded version of this book, and is easier to find, as ""the Bottom Dwellers"" is out of print."
5,Great Educational Toy,"This is a great educational toy!! Building bridges, recognizing sounds and matching the item with the sounds, digging thru dirt, driving and growing plants. has 3 different levels of difficulty.very appropriate for 3 yrs and above for learning and fun at the same time."
3,BOB,"This bob the builder game is ok, but my son who was 4 at the time and loves bob the builder lost interrest pretty quickly. Not alot to do on it. Plus I bought it used and later found out I could have went down the road and bought it new in the store for a lot less then what I paid for it here. Disapointed with the money I spent for a game that doesnt hold his attention too long. I bought this last yr and he has maybe played it 3 times in that yrs time.Not a good buy for me."
5,"If Tom Clancy wrote history, this would be it!","I highly recommend this novel - it's like an action story set in the past. I couldn't put it down, and it's also life changing- it made me think about what is most important to me. Check it out!"
5,This book is incredible!,"I never knew anything about St. Patrick - apart from the fact you wore green on his feastday - until I read Ms. Swinnea's novel. What an experience! Pirates, slaves, evil druids; all the trappings of fantasy, yet it's unbelievably real! I don't think it's possible to find a better read all summer - or even all year!"
2,Maybe my hopes were set too high?,"This item was purchased for a child with severe autism,and we did not get the results we were hoping for, which was better communication, eye contact, improved mood... we weren't looking for a miracle cure, but unfortunately we have seen no change. We used the product for two straight months."
4,Truth in Beauty...,"Over the past couple of years, I have really begun to acquire both a taste for Debussy's music as well as quite a collection of Debussy recordings. While I have many ""favorites"" in my collection, this disc is truly beautiful.As a previous reviewer noted, this disc is played on a piano that is nearly contemporary to the one Debussy himself would have played. More than that, this music is played by Alain Planès, who has devoted a good deal of time and thought to it.Children's Corner in particular is one of my favorite pieces by Debussy. I own several recordings of it in numerous arrangements. The recording here is enchanting in its stripped-down seeming simplicity.Whether you are new to Debussy or not, this is a disc that should not be missed."
4,cute but small,Would have loved the item to be more colorful and larger but its still a nice addition to my bettas tank and i would recommend this item for a small tank. Fast shipping and great packaging. Great seller as well
2,Way off on the colors that were shown!!,"I received a very crushed box via ups. After opening, surprised piece was altogehter, however the colors were way off compared to what we thought we were buying. We bought specifically for the yellow part of the piece. We wanted yellow in our decor (esp. bright). It is however a very ugly grey blue. We were hoping this piece would pop...colors are NOT bright!!"
3,very small,it was very small it look bigger on the picture but it is what nit nis. very cute in my tank funny when my fish try to get it it
3,small and cheap looking,when ordering the decor we knew it was not going to be huge but we definately expected the quality to be much better. would not buy again
1,caribbean crappola,The exotic caribbean reef is small as hell and so not worth my money. not like the picture either colors are off.
1,Don't buy,I buy this and when it came its so small I just throw it in the trash .. I spent 10$ on this item and I was so sorry .. It's you gonna spend that much might as well go to the pet store ..
1,Cheap Material,"IExotic Environments Caribbean Living Reef Aquarium Ornament, Mini , 4-Inch by 3-1/2-Inch by 3-1/2-Inchreceived the package wrapped in white starofoam. The product was not wrapped good as the box was very very weak in structure. I have decided never to buy from Amazon again. very dissatisfied with my purchase. Maybe it was because it was a gift for me on Fathers Day from my son. Product was broken in 3 pieces."
4,attractive rock decor,this looks great in our small fish tank. it is the perfect size for our tetra fish to swim inside. the colors did not seem quite as bright to me as in the photo but we still enjoy it.
5,Trigrams: Book Three of the Dragon's Wake Trilogy,"Trigrams is a gripping tale of the turbulent lives of a Korean family during and shortly after the Korean War. Through the eyes of Ai-Li, a bright 17 year old girl, we see a devastating family life that is both humorous and hopeful. The book is a page turner; you want the heroine to do well right away and come to identify with her."
3,Good for basics,"This is a good book for those who want to know the basics.The Fred Puhn bookHow to Make Your Car Handleis much better if you actually want to set up a car.For example, this book doesn't tell you how weight distribution affects understeer and oversteer. It just tells you that it's important.I have a 2002 WRX wagon, it has a smaller rear sway bar than the sedan, and has around 100 pounds more weight on the rear axle. This book would be absolutely no help in helping someone decide if they wanted to swap rear sway bars...(more weight on the rear tends to increase oversteer, and the smaller rear sway bar compensates)"
5,Versatile,"The Yamaha RX-497 AM/FM Stereo Receiver is an elegant piece of electronics. It produces high fidelity sound with lots of power. The front panel is intuitive and easy to use. The FM antenna is better than some add-on antennas I'd purchased previously. In addition to the radio, I count seven auxiliary inputs on the back (including XM radio) and two sets of speaker jacks so the amplifier has lots of flexibility. Remember to check the dimensions, the receiver is big."
4,Excellent Quality Receiver,Excellent sound. Easy set up. Very good FM reception. Does everything I need it to do. Only complaint is that the my Direct TV receiver does not have any codes that work to control it. This seems to be common with many of the Yamaha receivers.
5,Excellent,"Excellent price quality ratio. Sound is warm and well balanced. This receiver is for old fashion lovers, 2 channel output + a woofer.I paired it with JBL L830 3-Way 6-Inch Bookshelf Loudspeakers using bi-wiring connections. Sound is crystal clear, strong mids and deep bass."
5,Warm Coat,"This is a good quality coat. It seems to keep my dog warm and is very easy to put on and remove. It is getting tight around her middle, but can be extended with more velcro. I have not used the hood it came with, but may need to the next time it snows or rains (I am glad it came with one and that it is removable). Very nice product!"
4,Food for thought it,This is a beautiful story with so much wisdom. Colorful characters kept your interest throughout. It's a book I will read again.
5,Great read!,This is an excellent book. The characters are interesting. The writing is light and witty and the story is one we could all use in these challenging times. I've told everyone about the book. The sequel is just as good.
2,Decade - The Martins,"Not my taste, it is the more southern Gospel side of the Martins, so if you like that, perhaps you would like this too. Not the mellow harmonies I was expecting"
4,Great discovery,"Our local radio station was playing ""Better With You"" after midnight only. It instantly got my attention and I tracked down the artist through the song lyrics. I listened to some of the songs on her website but at that time I was uanble to find the DC in local stores or on Amazon. I bought it through her website and it has been in my CD player ever since--about 4 months now. Other CDs may rotate in and out, but this one stays. It has so many great songs and Abigail Zsiga has a voice that soars and captivates you. ""Better With You"" and ""Wide Open"" are my favorites though there is not one song on the CD that I don't like. I encourage you to buy this and tell all of your friends about this talented artist."
5,"After reading this book, I made money. Still useful info!","It has been over 5 years since I found and read this book. After reading it, I opened an on-line trading account, started following the guidelines in the book (the first part, not Options), and made money. I went on to read other books and trade using other methods. I believe it is working for me because I learned this method first. Now I have run into this listing on Amazon and would like to say it was a great book that opened up a whole world for me, by giving me a safe entry into trading and a method to fall back on in difficult markets. Read this book, read between the lines as well, and add this method to your investment repertoire! I thought since the book is older now, you'd like to read my review, 'cause I am still using what I learned from this book today."
2,Not as good as it looks,I wasn't very impressed with this book. I've read many of the major books in the market and have been trading for quite some time and I found that I didn't get anything substantial out of this one. maybe a good book if your just starting out but not for anyone that has traded over 6 months. Pretty much all he talks about is buying stocks under ten dollars and setting limit orders. And the amount of time he devotes to Wade Cook is irritating. Ok yea its obvious who your mentor is but you don't have to quote him on every bloody page and then put the titles of every one of his books in the appendix including the books that he wrote that has nothing to do with stocks. Wow maybe I'm really not impressed with this book.
3,Book is interesting reading.,Book is interesting reading.........but I doubt if any serious money could be made on a regular basis following the author's advice.I would recommend its reading for information only.........not as an additional income generator.
4,Good Book,"This book discusses Wade Cook's investing method of ""rolling stocks"". It goes into the details of investing in these stocks in much more depth than Wade Cook. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone interested in managing their own stock portfolio, whether you chose to use this investment method or not, as it explains the cycles many stocks go through, and can help in deciding an entry and exit point. I have used this method in investing and have good returns, although I have also combined this method of investing with information I have learned from other sources. This book can definitly be a valuable resource in a well rounded investment library."
1,What a waste,"I read the reviews and then the book. It is truly a waste of money. The author paints a rozy scenario where you make millions with the system. Sure, it can be done, but it takes money, time and knowledge. You get nothing of those three from the book. Witt's only purpose in writing this book must have been to tempt the reader to sing up for those expensive Wade Cook seminars. Also, he touts big time the TC2000 software. That is a good package (I use it) but it is not the only one. Metastock has better formula control than TC2000, for instance. This is not the book to buy if you want to invest. If you are curious about what rolling stocks is, then this is an interesting 20 dollar thing to read."
1,Great book - for the gullible and simple minded,"Aside from the obnoxious advertising for Cook's dubious seminar business, the foundation of this book is fundamentally flawed. Of course it looks easy buying at the low and selling at the high when you look at a HISTORICAL chart - it already happenned! Doing so in the future is much more difficult, and the truth is these ""strategies"" are more wishful thinking when someone tries to enact them in a real portfolio over the long term. Witt/Cook don't cover some important aspects of bid/ask spread, fundamental reasons for volatility, etc. Refer to Cook's early books, and you'll note that of the dozen or so stocks he uses to illustrate his ""rolling stock"" concept, three are now bankrupt and all but one are now down at least 40% from where they were in 1996. Strange, but for those who bought these ""rollers"", there was never a chance to sell at the high...This book is full of wishful thinking, no matter how eloquent it sounds."
2,There's better book's out there,Lacks real information about stochastics and mov.averages. Also seems to sneak in advertisment type writing along with the material. If your really serious about rolling stocks i'd look for a better book.
2,how to lose your money,"This book will explain nothing new. All the information can be found on the internet. If you believe in fairytales, yes then you should buy this book (The writer thinks it's possible to make a million in 3 year's with this system).I think it's possible to make some money with rollingstocks, but if you are in a rollingstock and the market turns against you it doesn't work. So if you buy a roller and short it a few days/weeks later and we are in a bull market you will lose money! The writer should also explain more and better about stochastics and mov.averages. The book looks great in theory but in real life you won't find perfect stocks."
1,Not really that good...,"The stocks which do exhibit the seemingly profitable rolling patterns are usually low-priced garbage stocks that are poised for continued declines. I don't think Witt's book offers much valuable insight into analyzing the stocks technically or fundamentally. So the guy tells how to use stochastics... big deal. There is very little actual material that the book covers -- it could probably be compressed into a one or two page pamphlet. Wade Cook is this guy's idol, so go read some of the reviews of the Wade Cook books to get a better idea."
3,It made sense but I didn't do it,I have never bought a stock in my life. But if I were tobuy stock this seems to be an interesting and safe way to do it.I didn't finish the book but I don't think its the author'sfault...my interests drifted into other things.

3,It was ok,"Although some of the ideas in the book were interesting, I think I could have gotten most of the same information by just searching for the same thing on Google and looking at the results."
3,Great for Beginners,"This is a great book for beginners that are looking for any possible way to make extra money. There are, as stated in the title, 101 ways to make extra money, anything from washing windows to starting your own consulting business. While it gives a number of ideas, there is nothing I found in this book that I didn't already know. I've been self employed working from home on and off for the last few years, and everything in this book is something I learned for free on the internet. I don't know if this post will be removed for spam after I say the following, but for any beginner your first stop should be […] (work at home moms). I am not a mother, but found this website extremely helpful from the start. I rated it 3 starts because I think it will help others that are just starting out, but unfortunately for me it was a waste of $10 for the kindle version."
5,Can't get it out of my head!,"This is a great one... The opening number, ""I'm Alive"", rocks! As far as the other pieces, well, not bad at all. Emotions ranged from pure joy to tenderness... Also, Nathan Hale in ""One"" comes portrays very convincingly the cynical cat, Snowball. What can I say? Mandy Moore, etc., ALL the performers were excellent, and Alan Silvestri shows why he's such a highly valued composer."
4,Four Stars...But Only For Two Songs,"Normally, I would not give a CD that I only listen to two songs from four stars, but these two songs are so good, I just had to give it the rating I did. The only two songs that I like are I'm Alive by Celine Dion. Celine is such an amazing singer and this is another amazing song from her. My favorite song ever right now is Top of the World by Mandy Moore, and that's why I bought this album. Mandy's voice on Top of the World has matured, and I like it much more than her other poppy songs. If you love a song on this and aren't able to download it or get it somewhere else, I recommend the CD. But if not, I wouldn't get it. (By the way, I won't give reviews for the other songs because I can't stand them)!"
1,Zen and the Art of Writing Nothing(new),"There is nothing new which would add to your knowledge of basic ""new age"" cliches by reading this book. It would not be bad if he applied new age concepts, in a unique manner, to diabetes management. But , he doesn't. The only thing that makes this a ""diabetes book"" is the fact that his diabetes caused him to begin a search in the new age section of his local bookstore. Usually, ADA books are excellent, but this is one time satori was missed."
5,Too nice?,"This is my second of these tire covers. The first one looked so good that some #%@&!*?+$-bum stole it right off my car while we were in a restaurant. When I received this new one I modified it to add a padlock. Anyone with a penknife could still steal it, but not without irreparably damaging it. So far so good. I really love this cover."
3,Just Average,These iced coffee packets were just average. I make them in my blender with ice and a splash of creme. I found them a little bland and they have a little bit of a chalky aftertaste. I won't order these again. I guess Its off to Starbucks..
4,Make cafe drinks at home!,This product arrived as advertised and on time. Excellent for tiding oneself over till the next trip downtown to the cafe. Try making the drink with cold coffee as the base liquid.
2,Endless and boring,"I was enthusiastic about the book at first. The catchy title, the attractive front cover, and particularly the addition of drawings of ammonites at the beginning of each chapter appealed to me. It turned out to be a great disappointment. Half-way through the book, as I was reading about Smith's financial difficulties, I have to admit that I thought,""Who cares?"". The reason is not that William Smith or his life or his research are uninteresting, quite the contrary; it is the author's style that is stuffy. He writes in a way that makes it sound as if the whole subject bored him out of his mind, that he couldn't wait to be done with it, and threw in a lot of fancy words to make up for his own lack of enthusiasm.I love geology, and I wish that William Smith and the seminal research he did were shown in a better light. This book doesn't do justice to either of them."
3,More for Rock Doctors..........,"One could not imagine a more dry topic but Winchester has mangaged to put some passion and ""excitment"" into this matter, but its not enough to carry this ""novice"" reader. His use of footnotes is annoying at times as they are often mildly related facts which may have been dug up during his research . Not in the league of D Sobel's ""Longitude"" or Winchester's other book on the compilation of OED but still a fitting recognition of what was a major contribution to science. Wait till its in soft cover for better value"
2,"Extremely uncritical, in colloquial british","This extremely fannish book (he actually calls Smith his hero at one point) is a biography of William Smith, the man who developed the first Geological map (of Britain). It details his difficulties, many self-caused, and his many ""uniquely positive"" incidents. (Yes, that was contradictory). Additionally, the extreme political correctness of the author (as with most authors/academics, it seems) makes him constantly abashed at the class snobbery of early 19th century England. Well duh! You can't judge the actions of people divorced from their culture.It also leaves the impression that the map shows the geological layers beneath each point, whereas I think what it actually says is that the map only shows the rock types of the top layer - a far less amazing accomplishment.Written by a brit to an colloquial audience that knows the geography of Britain well, as an american I found at least a third of the book incomprehensible."
5,Where it all began,"The thought that at one time people believed that fossils were simply gifts from God hidden in the strata is truly mind-boggling to those of us sitting firmly in the 21st century. We take many things for granted in our science and technology filled world and Simon Winchester does a nice job of taking the reader back in time, creating the context and thought of that time, and then pulling you through the transition to a much more modern way of thinking.Following the saga of how William Smith used coal mining assays he was doing to piece together the fossil record is interesting history. Understanding the influence on 18th and 19th century thought is pure social context and commentary. The book makes one wonder how many other ""strata maps"" are laying around to change our paradigms and thinking."
2,factual errors,"This book made interesting reading and I would say it was well written. However, it only gets two stars because of the sloppy editing... if I'm not an expert and caught some errors on the first read, how many more are there that I didn't notice. For example, the author states that stromatolites and trilobites were extinct by the end of the Carboniferous Era. Well, in fact, it's pretty widely accepted that trilobites lived past the Carboniferous, and stromatolites still exist today. After reading the book, I found Stephen Jay Gould's review of it; he noticed not only substantial errors in natural history, but in the accounts of people's lives and motivations. There's no excuse for this kind of poor work."
3,It's a decent read,"The Map That Changed the World is an informative read for geologist enthusiasts. It has the style of the Professor and the Madman but it deals with rocks instead of paper. I liked the way Winchester describes what it must have been like to live in the time of William Smith and the events of his life and his work. Before I had no found interest in geology, but after reading this I find it intriguing."
2,Agree w/ tediously repetitive hyperbole by previous reviewer,"Hearing of the release of this book, I was looking forward to reading it. After stuggling through it, I thought I had missed something until I read other reviewers. Didn't someone edit this book? Many of the reviewers are correct; it is not a well- written book on an interesting man. In fact, if you read the acknowledgments (page 317), it appears that the author has ripped off the good stuff from Professor Hugh Torrens who was writing on the same subject. Let's encouage the Professor to finish his works. Maybe that will give William Smith's memory a better turn."
2,Should have been shorter,"This book presents the interesting life of William Smith, who created the world's first geological map.The trouble is, William Smith's life is not >>very<< interesting and the material doesn't justify a full length book. A good magazine article would have done the job. The same can be said of Simon Winchester's other OK book, the Professor and the Madman.If SW could write a few more of these interesting lives, keep them at say 10,000 words each, and publish them in a collection , then the resulting book would probably merit 4 stars. As it is, 2 will do ."
2,The Map That Changed The World,This book is very easy to put down. I have labored through about 1/3 but I intend to perservere only because I purchased it. Anyone with a minimal understanding of geology will stand shoulder to shoulder with the knowledge I have thus far gleened from this book.
2,Tediously repetitive hyperbole,"Reading between the lines, I would guess that the author was unable to unearth enough material to really make William Smith come to life, in a narrative sense. So instead he substituted continual breathless assertion of the brilliance and audacity of Smith's accomplishment as though leading a cheering section, and repeatedly related those aspects of Smith's history which he *did* possess, in slightly different format, over and over again throughout the book. In other words, what could've been a fascinating magazine article was instead inflated into an exceedingly dull book, with a muddled timeline and so much hyperbole that I have come to dislike William Smith.Pass this one by."
1,Just read the dust jacket,"This is a poorly written, pedantic book about an interesting subject. But it's not interesting in this writer's hands. You can save yourself the frustration of reading his writing by just reading the dust jacket - it sums it up quite nicely. Take a look at the ""front flap"" and ""back flap"" links on this site, and save yourself the money. Or borrow it from the library, if the more positive reviews pique your curiosity. Definitely not worth buying."
3,"Great subject, could have been written better","This is one of the genre of short non-fiction books on science-technical topics for the layperson. Unfortunately, Winchester (who wrote the amazing *The Professor and the Madman*) has not stepped up to the plate on this effort. Too many non-fiction writer rely on an accounting of facts and go no further; that's what he's done here. That might pass for a textbook, but I want the facts to form a story, to bring the history alive."
4,Never Has Geology Been So Much Fun,"This book is about the birth of Geology as a science and its founder William Smith. While this is not as good as Winchester's later books, it still is a great read. As with his other subjects, he is able to explore potentially dull topics with passion and insight."
4,more about the man than the map,"This was an excellent read (well, an excellent listen -- I have the audio cassette). The book is more about the story of William Smith, the man who made the map, than about the ways the map changed the world. Winchester repeatedly refers to the revolutions in geological and biological and thus also spiritual thought that sprang from the map and from the stratigraphic theory it embodies, but doesn't follow that thread of intellectual history forward beyond the map itself. As a biologist, I'd have loved to hear more about those ramifications. The Norton History of the Environmental Sciences, by Peter J. Bowler, presents much of that story. It's drier than Winchester's highly personal and dramatic tale, but still quite readable.That said, I heartily enjoyed this book and will be recommending it to friends."
3,Doesn't Quite Deliver,"I'm a big fan of this genre -- though admittedly I haven't read Winchester's acclaimed ""Professor and Madman"" -- but this book I found tedious, if interesting. There's a lot of build-up, but the climax is rather anticlimactic. This would have made a good feature article, but doesn't hold up as a full-length book. Also, I found the geological explanations difficult to follow, the use of footnotes on nearly every page (and in mouse-sized type) very cloying, and the editing shoddy. The author sets us up to believe that the map ""changed the world"" by moving it from a dogma-based to science-based paradigm, but provides little direct evidence to support this. Smith's achievement rather seems to parallel this change, not precipitate it."
3,18th century prose does not do justice to Smith's,"I was very disappointed in this book having read The Professor and the Madman. A good editor is badly needed.I was interested in knowing more about Smith's seminal contributions to geological theory, so I made my way through the whole book.However, the convoluted prose made it most unenjoyable and less enlightening than it could be. I found sentence structures reminded me of 18th century novels. This is not my idea of a 21st century biography.The repetitive obsession with the 'class struggle' could easily be eliminated and cut out at least 1/3 in poorly constructed sentences and padded narrative development.Sure, Smith lived at a time when 'class' distinctions were a dominant preoccupation in Britain. Yes, Smith managed to accomplish quite a lot in spite of it, but the reader does not need to be bombarded by the same or similar information about this in every chapter."
4,A beautiful book,"I bought this as a gift, it almost wasn't. Its a lovely thing, a fine example of book binding. I read snippets of it as I wrapped Chirstmas presents, what I saw I liked. Recommended."
3,Good for some,"There are three types of people who may enjoy this book. First, those with an interest in 19th century English history who also know about the English countryside (have been to some of the places mentioned in the book). Second, anyone with a serious interest in geography since this is about one of the founding fathers. Third, anyone who is a Simon Winchester fan. I fall in to the last. Winchesters writing style is top notch as usual, but the truth is, this is not a very interesting person (at least in his personal life) and Simon goes to transparent lengths to hype up the perspective of ""boy from the wrong side of the tracks shakes up the establishment"", thus the many cries of hagiography. I've never been to England and could not relate with the plethoria of place names, and I have only a minor interest in geography so that aspect was interesting, but not exciting. If your reading this just because you are a Winchester fan, be warned you'll want to bring more."
2,Why was this a best seller?,Disappointing sums it up for me. If I wasn't interested in geology already I would be even more disappointed. The author could have done more with this interesting saga in the history of geology if he hadn't tried to blow it up into something more earth-shaking than it really was. I think his editors were asleep with all the repetitive foreshadowing and over-the-top declarations of at-the-time unappreciated genius. For a good geology read try John McPhee.
1,pass on this title,I had many hours of flying ahead of me and this was the wrong book to have taken. The fact that it was the only book I had gave me great incentive to like it. I didn't. I left it on the plane for someone more desperate than myself.
2,Deadly dull,"I'm sorry, but not even Simon Winchester's earnest enthusiasm and lyrical prose can save this tale. It's just too dull. I got through about halfway, and couldn't finish.Winchester is a glorious writer in his twin histories of the Oxford English Dictionary. But here his subject is just too obscure and trivial, and try as he might, Winchester can't make it seem interesting."
1,5 stars for print book but give Kindle book 1 for DRM use: DRM Fail!,I do not buy Kindle books or use Kindle e-reader devices. Amazon's Kindle is a Swindle because of its DRM. Products like these intentionally use DRM to dumb users down and restrict fair use rights. Therefore they are defective by design. I understand the convenience of using e-books and having an e-book reader if your traveling you don't have to carry 10 or more heavy paperback or hardcover books but at least with printed books you own a copy of the book not a license to access which can be revoked as Amazon has already done by remotely deleting George Orwell's 1984 from Kindles. It doesn't matter that in the outrage they apologized for it the fact they have the technical capability to do so is troubling and wrong.
5,Better Than Half Off Store Price,"Ditto to everything in the first review. Local drug store (CVS, Rite Aid) prices are in the $12-14 range last I checked. Costco almost faked me out on price by having a different dosage and number of capsules than the usual amount and labelling it ""Extra Strength."" When I got home and did the calculations the numbers didn't add up as I had expected. Turned out not to be the bargain I had expected for Costco. So the box went right back. And now I know to just stick with buying these in quantity to keep shipping prices down. And in Southern California figure 10% for sales tax. So buy five to ten bottles at a time. Same as store brand there is a lot of empty space in each bottle. So if you want to save space you can put the contents of about three bottles in one."
4,Speedo Size 24,"This is an excellent suit for a large size person like myself. Very comfortable. My only complaint is that it is not really a ""shelf bra"" It does have padded cushions for the bra. However, it is nicely made and I think it will be a long lasting suit. It also washed nice."
5,Fantastic Receiver,"Im not sure what the previous reviewers problems were? But My sony STR-DA3000 ES has been working perfectly for 3 years now. I have driving my 7.1 setup of Mirage Omnistats and Polk Sub in the Game room and controling the XM/CD music piped outside under our two decks! Ive been in Electrical/Software Engineering for 26 years and a Musician for 33 years, I know sound and I know power and this provides both very well.FC"
3,A lot of information,"I really liked this book, it has a tremendous amount of information and very concise. However as an updated version, the lack of graphics makes this book difficult to follow. It would be a much better book if ANY graphics were included. For me the cost of this book is unacceptable due to the quality of the presentation of the information."
5,The Gold Standard,"This is a highly regarded text book, the gold standard. I'm delighted to have it in my library. If you are a dedicated breeder, this is an excellent source of important genetic information! I highly recommend it!"
1,????? this is it???,"it was on back order from another place, i finally got it and its this little book......not worth the wait, was upset about all the stuff i knew already was in it, it was supposed to be this great book......if you already have an understanding for genetics and diseases then dont bother paying for this book. for the novice person, its a little over whelming i think....informational for them but not for me."
4,Gr-8 CD!,"I feel this is a very good CD. It has a great compilation of very cool songs I hear often at clubs. Also, songs blend seemlessly together which is a real plus! The only reason why I rate it with 4 stars is that I was expecting songs with higher beats per minute, since I want to use it for my advanced-step class where we usually work with 142 bpm. The highest in this CD is 138. But still, it's great to work up a good sweat and have fun at the same time!"
5,Cleaning product,"This should be renamed to a cleaning product...because i have been clearing the balls off the table with it!what an excellent priced cue and the quality is very much worth what I paid for itit even stood up to cues that cost as much as $50good purchase.FYI, the handle on mine was wrapped when it came, but the string that wrapped it was a thin type of string. it feels fine as a grip"
4,"Item is good, but no wrap","The cue itself is good, worth the price. But as described by someone before, no nylon wrap came with the cue!! The description is not accurate.Plus, the cue is 19 oz.. I saw on walmart website that the same item is 21oz.. Dont know if it's a random shipping."
2,packed no good,"the item was recieved used. it was unpackeged , and not redone. it had been used. but the main thing i wanted was a 16 oz cue ,it was a 19 oz . nowhere in your add did it say what weight it was . none of your cue give that important info."
3,IT is just OK,"I read previous reviews, I have knew that the stick will not come with case, because i was hoping that this stick is good quality. However it turns out to be a little disappointed. The material is too soft, not hard enough. The bad results is It will keep vibrating when it hits ball."
4,Great cue for the $,"Great cue comes ready to use right out of the box. I still suck at pool, but I'm not blaming the cue. I've now moved on to blaming the table or my opponent"
1,My pillow loves this book.,"It loves it because every time I go to read it my pillow gets used when I fall asleep. This book has a couple of parts that are interesting, but mostly it is boring political views. If you don't have a passion for East Asia, do not read this book; it is like pulling teeth."
3,Useful information and insights but WAY too political...,"This book was easy to read and offered valuable insights on modern Korean history, and presented a lot of useful and interesting information. However, the author interjects entirely too much of his own rather extreme political opinion into the text, making the dissenting reader feel alienated when trying to read the other more pertinent information in the text. These comments are peripheral to the message of the text, and serve only to advertise what the author thinks about US domestic affairs, and other issues esentially unrelated to Korea. I think he gives a well-documented fair and balanced critique of both Korean regimes, but it is the frequent off-the-cuff political remark (not to mention the elitist comment that Americans might be better off if we placed our scholars in higher esteem) that were very distracting and annoying while trying to read this otherwise timely and well-written book."
2,Muckraking at it's most selective.,"When you ignore all evidence from North Korean escapees about life in the country, NK isn't that bad of a place to live. Great Job, Cumings.That being said, his history of ancient Korea is engaging, and help explains NK's xenophobia. And his histories of SK and the Korean war are muckrakingly delicious.But his piss-poor (almost muck-free) chapter on NK undermines all that."
5,How to ace the AFOQT,"I purchased this study guide in order to prepare me for the Air Force Officer's Qualifying Test (AFOQT). It gave me everything necessary to ace the test (it also contains a complete AFOQT sample test). When I took the AFOQT I scored a 95 out of a possible 99 on the pilot composite. Trust me get this book if you want a pilot slot. This book also contains valuable information on Army, Navy/Marine Flight Aptitude test."
4,Good companion,"I son loves this van. He was 6 months when I bought this so obviously there is no educational value, but he is all right with it."
4,Fun & entertaining toy,"This is a great toy and we love the animal sounds and music. It's fun to see the animals bob up and down as the van is pushed. The woman's voice who identifies the animals and the rest of the other phrases has a heavy English accent, which was a surprise, but it grows on you. Overall a nice toy that lights up, has movement, provides several means of entertainment/educational elements, and an on/off switch! Gotta love that!!!"
1,weak,"very weak magnets, fell off on first use, would not buy or recommend this is not safe to use on any tailor unless you like dragging wires behind you on the highways"
5,You won't stop dancing,You will listen to The Lovemakers over and over!It's about time we have music that makes sense again!!!
2,review from Synthesis,"I hate to be so harsh, but Times of Romance just isn't that great. It could just be me, because I've never really been a fan of the whole electronica, beat-heavy music trend. None of the tracks really seem to pull in my attention, they just all drone on with a slow, draining, futuristic sound. The band claims to address times of romance, but the only times that come to mind are the `80s. It has the complete feel of a slower-paced techno record, with lyrics that rant about sex and materialistic nonsense. If you're feeling a soft spot for the past, get this album, throw on some leg warmers and let loose.- Robin BaciorSynthesis.net"
1,This book is a case of Eternal Torment,"This is what I get for not paying attention to the publisher of a book. Save your money. The book is filled with fallacies from cover to cover. This is not a scholarly work. If you are looking for a scholarly discussion of Universalism this is certainly not it.For example, the author cites various quotations from early church writers but provides no references, so there is no way to check the text and context of the citation.The author plays instant Greek scholar by citing a concordance, rather than standard lexigraphical works. This book is horrible."
2,not what i expected,thought this book would help to prepare to for the praxis exam. i sent the book back
5,Happy to find,"I was happy to find this and another similar book as a way to introduce Thanksgiving to my class of preschoolers with mild special needs. The simple text and lovely illustrations offer enough food for thought on the subject of gratitude as it relates to very young children. Falling leaves, school, dress-up and family are beautifully illustrated and set the tone for a pleasant interactive read-aloud. My class was thoroughly engaged by this simple gem."
5,Such a sweet lil' story!,"Oh, this is such a cute story. Both my 7 and 2 year old really enjoyed reading it last night. It really connects the dots for smaller kids on all that they have to be thankful for."
3,Thanksgiving book,"Perhaps I didn't read the description carefully enough, but I was a little disappointed in this book. It definitely gives lots of things to be thankful for, but it didn't seem as much like a Thanksgiving book as just a book about giving thanks.Not what I was looking for, but an okay book all the same."
5,Excellent Thanksgiving book for young children,This book is an excellen choice for young children. I would recommend it for 3 to 6 year old children.
3,A cure for snobbish Anglophiles,"These old postcards show prime examples of mid-20th Century blandification in Britain, from boxy-looking schools to boxy-looking malls (both centers of societal indoctrination, by the way, so why NOT the similar architecture?); from sterile-looking hotels filled with queasy-looking bourgeoisie to sterile-looking trailer parks filled with queasier-looking bourgeoisie (but then, almost all the people on these cards wear the same queasy, desperately-having-normal-fun expressions). Anyone interested in spooky, utilitarian environments, and how the bourgeoisie try convincing themselves and others to enjoy these environments, will find this book interesting. However, how many people, especially Americans, even notice their characterless surroundings anymore? This book's point might be lost on readers inured from birth to characterlessness."
4,Tragic,"A strange, alien experience, 'Boring Postcards' is quite literally a set of boring postcards. In a book. Although it's the kind of thing you buy expecting it to be kitsch it's actually deeply affecting - taken at a time when Britain was rebuilding itself after WWII, and 'Dan Dare' from 'Eagle' proposed a future in which Britain ruled space, the concrete buildings, motorways and civic centres are almost heartbreakingly sad nowadays - the equivalent of the bull ring market in Birmingham. If this book was an object it would be one of those tomato-shaped squeezy ketchup dispensers, or a faded yellow plastic school chair."
5,Another Must-Read From Natasha Rostova!,"Ms.Rostova does it again! Ms.Rostova adapts three modern tales from older fairy-tales and creates a delightful trio of intertwining erotica tales of friendship, sexuality & transformation. Ms.Rostova leaves the reader breathless with a wide varity of sexual explorations and true-to-life characters that mirror today's woman. Brava! An engrossing & fun read! Brava!"
1,ZERO starts not an option unfortunately,The author should be sued for deception. The biggest blunder I've ever made was buying this book.
5,Great story for kids,"I remember seeing this on PBS when I was younger and then as a older kid, I didn't see this show anymore and missed it, (this show, forgot what it was called, had a whole bunch of neat stories and out of clamation). So when I saw this on dvd, I had to get it for my kids. It teaches selfishness and generosity and doing the right thing. Neat story. ""Old version"" type of clamation but that's not a problem whatsoever. Great dvd to add to your collection."
2,More Like Sun Dried Tomato Dust,This product was drier than beef jerky. Actually drier than toilet paper. It was more like dust than anything. The extra star is for the taste. I would never buy this again.
2,not worth my time,"i read this god forsaken book to my son, and by the end of the first chapter he successfully guessed every plot twist and the ending. this wouldn't have been too bad, if only he was older than 6. as a reader myself i cannot even dream of recommending this foul bit to anyone even to those younger than 12. I will give it two stars however, for being a first try. if the book had impressed me more i might look into the next one she writes but i don't think i'll be doing that. bottom line, stick to the classics."
3,Beware of size,The size is way off on these shoes. I did end up returning them but they were very helpful with the whole process
4,Compelling but fictional account,"This is one of the best films of 2010. The acting and story telling are superb, not to mention the scenery. However, this movie is mistakenly touted as ""inspired by a true story."" To set the record straight, the film is based on the book ""The Long Walk"" which was proven to be fabricated. Author Slavomir Rawicz's story was discredited by BBC reporter Hugh Levinson. According to Levison, Rawicz was discharged from prison and did not escape. Even Peter Weir refers to ""The Long Walk"" as a novel and the film as fiction (in interviews).The film was so amazing that I was disappointed to discover the story behind it is a fabrication. Nonetheless, ""The Way Back"" is a compelling survival drama that's still worth watching. But, it should be looked at as a fictional account. Referring to the film as ""inspired by a true story"" misleads people into thinking that all the impossible feats achieved by the characters are true when they're not."
4,"Slow and sometimes stilted, but delivers in the end","I read the book ""The Long Walk"" upon which this is based, a long time ago and loved it. I don't really know how well the movie follows the book, since it has been so long. Character development is a bit limited for the first half of the movie, and at times I got the feeling that they had to do some liberal cutting to make the movie short enough. However, simple though the plot may be, it is a great story of survival and love.There are 2 or 3 scenes that contain lewd drawings and profanity in the subtitles early on."
3,"Movie is ok, not as good as the book!","It is an ok attempt , but not nearly as good as the book. I thought the plot was pretty weak and much more could have been done to make this an epic movie."
4,Good,"Do you really read those 5 paragraph reviews? It was a Friday night, I chose this movie and I enjoyed it."
5,This is about really true grit and love for freedom!,Everyone who loves freedom should buy and see this movie. It is better than anything else I have seen in years!
5,Triumph in Tragedy,"Based upon a true story, The Way Back is both compelling and poignant--humanity at its best and worst. Through it all, we learn what really binds us together--enduring love."
4,Great movie,"Great movie to watch on a lazy afternoon. Really didn't think it would take off like it did, but I was pleasantly surprised that it did. Although slow at times, it is a very well written movie with incredible cinematography. Peter Weir is a great Director, and did not disappoint this time."
5,the way back,this is a good movie to watch on a hot summer day i liked it a lot thank you for your fast shipping of this movie. ed harris is a great actor and i love saoirse ronan.
3,A little tedious,"This is a journey film about a band of Siberian prisoners who walk all the way to India, 4000 miles. It shows a lot of human degredation, such as extreme hunger causing them to eat raw flesh. They always seem to be just about dead when something appears just over the next hill, usually water, or maybe a snake to eat. I wasn't especially captivated by the tale, since we know how it's going to turn out. There was something here based in reality, I think, but they don't say much about that, and there's nothing in the extras about it, which is too bad. In all, overrated."
3,Disappointed,"Weir was scheduled to do a film based on the book, Shantaram, set in Mumbai starring Johnny Depp, but it never went forward. So it's been a while since he has directed a film. Very unfortunate that this Peter Weir film is filled with cliche, because he has given us outstanding films in the past. Yes, the landscapes are beautiful, but it is a waste of talent for Colin Farrell, Ed Harris and Mark Strong."
2,Don't say its based on the book if it isn't!!!!!,The book this movie was about was just amazing. it was the real life story of true hope. The movie is both dis-respectful to the writter and just plain made up. if your going to make a movie about a book respect it. The writter went through hell to get home and the movie maker just made it hollywood. Don't bother
3,HOGWASH,"Ostensibly, this is a cracking film. There are seven principal characters, mostly tough men, used to enduring the worst kinds of privation. Or so they think; but then things get worse. During their ordeal, their humanity shines through. They learn to care about each other and the film is an essay in human dignity.There is one big problem. The journey they undertake is so fantastic that it requires a solid foundation in fact for us to suspend our disbelief as to the rest. We are led to believe that the foundation exists, because the central character did after all escape from the Gulag Archipelagio in 1941, cross the Siberian waste, the Gobi Desert and the Himalayas on foot, and eventually find sanctuary in British India. However, on reading Wikipedia afterwards, I find that scarcely any of this is true. In that light, the whole film resembles the happy ending - it is all hogwash.I still liked the film though.Stephen Cooper"
3,A slow moving but inspiring true story about a prisoner escape from the Siberian gulag during WWII. Great acting. I say B-,"How far can the human spirit take you? After being imprisoned my communists in the Siberian gulag during WWII, a group escapes and begins the long journey to freedom. This is another diffilcut movie to review for me. It's a true story and pretty powerful, but also very slow moving I thought. The acting is excellent, Colin Farrell is really, really good in this. The story is powerful and inspiring, but it is hard to get into. This is in no way a bad movie, but to me it was not as good as I was hoping. Many will really enjoy this, as I did, but I felt it was missing something to make it great. I just can't tell you what it was. Powerful and inspiring, just slow. I give it a B-Would I watch again? - I don't think so"
4,Survival Story,"The setting for this movie is the beginning of the World War II in Poland. Janusz is accused of being a spy by the Soviets and after a forced confession he is sent to a Siberian forced labor camp. The story continues with a handful of them escaping from the prison and making their way all the way to India.Their journey is an inspirational survival story. Not all of them make it to freedom however, only four. Excellent cinematography of a beautiful landscape.You will not find special effects in this movie, but it still is an interesting movie to watch."
2,Hot and cold,"About a half-dozen escapees from a Siberian prison set off on a Cacciatto-esque hike to someplace, anyplace that will have them (China? India?).The story somehow shirks Peter Weir's usually uncanny ability to make the simple things fascinating. He packs infinitely more heart and detail into the brisk nature hike in ""Master and Commander"" than he does into all 133 minutes of this.The characters are handled so impersonally that, at various points, I wasn't even sure how many guys were still on the trek."
2,Painful - I'd rather be at the dentist,"I loved the book, but this movie was painfully slow. The suspense of the book was not present. So muck talent, but the movie did not live up to my expectations. Wonderful performances, but either the director and/or the editor failed miserably."
1,Don't waste your time,"For anyone who has read ""The Long Walk"" and was anxiously looking forward to this movie, you'll be terribly disappointed. There is not enough time or space to detail the failures of the movie and quite frankly I would rather put it out of my mind as soon as possible."
1,NOT a true story!,"This movie is based on a book called, 'The Long Walk', which is NOT a true story. The BBC did some investigative reporting and this article has all the details:[...]Can't believe they are calling this film a true story. I am unimpressed. You would think the director/producer would at least do some minimal research on the book before claiming 'true story'. Sure, the story is great, but it's not a true story, no matter how much everyone wants to believe it's true."
5,Forget about reality,"Sometimes hollywood really is better than reality. I have not read the book, but from what the reviews state, I think I like the movie better. Just the fact that someone can survive an escape from a Gulag and walk thousands of km is enough fact for me. The movie was very enjoyable and ultra realistic."
4,Scary! -- but true,"I've read a lot of scary fiction authors in my time, but nothing compares to what the Jakes witness in this book -- and it's all true. Dale and Connie Jakes are civilians who go undercover at a Freemen compound in Montana. They have a handshake agreement with the FBI - they dish up dirt on local members, and the FBI gives them $25,000. The Jakes deposit their children with a friend and go in thinking it will be a short few months of undercover work. It turns into several very scary years with the Freemen, at which at any time they could be discovered and horribly murdered.What the Jakes find, and how the FBI uses the couple (in every sense of the word) makes up the bulk of the book. Folks, this book freaked me out. It is very hard to believe that our country has in it such cruel, hardened, vicious wackos as are protrayed in the book but it does. This book is very much a wake-up call to the internal terroism that is happening in America today."
4,riveting story of courage against dangerous terrorists,"Great inside account of life with the Montana Freemen, who are now known as conducting one of the most comprehensive and dangerous criminal enterprises in the history of the U.S."
5,Original lineup's peak commercially and artistically,"The MTB run of truly outstanding records peaked with Carolina Deams, an lp that was deservedly their best selling. Although it's a relatively country oriented release, somehow, it also managed to break out in a big way on album rock radio, and then, of course, more mainstream radio with Heard it in a Love Song. It's an unbelievable shame that Capricorn didn't release the live follow up ""Stompin' Room Only"" as was planned; because as we now know (it's just been released more than 25 years later) it would have been a good career move at that time. MTB had some other good releases prior to the demise of the original band, but this was the last of the 5 star albums."
5,A must have!!!!,"When you've worn out several eight tracks and a dozen or so cassettes, then I guess you're a big fan. This classic ""show band/cross over"" group is entertainment at it's best. Not a bad song on the set. These guys were super musicianns and their arrangements are so balanced. "" I'm gonna tell that to the Devil....when I see him today!"
3,It works,"The bad thing about it is that only works very close to the radio, meaning that it has low frequency power. Also dreins all the battery within 3 or 4 hours, so youll need to have a charger. Nonetheless it works well."
2,hsssssss ssssssss,"This is the first FM transmitter I have tried for my iPod, so maybe there are others that work better. This one produces a hiss that is just barely tolerable at best. Transmitting on most frequencies included an overpowering hiss. At 87.9MHz the hiss was tolerable, but just barely. I was hoping to do away with my tape adapter, but the tape adapter, despite its wire and tape noise, is still better than this hissing transmitter... I like the transmitter idea so I may try again, but it is unlikely that this one will be used. At least it was only $15 with shipping and tax. My advice? Just skip the bubblegum."
5,"Good price, good quality","I have had this belly ring for a long time now and it has lasted all this time. It is still my favourite one, because it is still beautiful. Very good price for it."
5,Relax and sleep...,I put this on and relax; the next thing I know it's morning. The music is beautiful and I really enjoy listening to it.
4,Syrup for the mind,"This is very relaxing, soothing music. All selections are of similar caliber: harmonius and beautiful. It's something like New Age Baroque; good evening listening before bed."
2,Dissapointing,"On the positive side, LiquidMind VIII Sleep has perfected transition issues -- never any loud music to jolt you after a quiet piece. However, it is so monotone, I can't fall sleep lisening to what sounds like an endless note. The style of long, drawn out tones has been stretch too far. Very dissapointed. Maybe it's something you have to get used too."
2,Not up to usual standards,"I am a big fan of Liquid Mind. Ambience Minimus, Balance and Unity are masterworks. Sleep, however, is frankly boring. There is nothing new here, no real progression, and it seems like Chuck is coasting. This isn't heresy - every great group has some less than perfect albums. Sleep (and Spirit) are not very good, and I would hate for some newbie to try one and decide not to look further because they picked one of these first."
2,"Nah !!!! just did not do it for me,Sorry !","It is a good product, but was not for me, I have had trouble sleeping for over twenty years, and it proved a tad iritaing instead of calming.."
5,Definitely makes you drowsyzzz zzzzz zzzzzz zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I happened to hear this on XM Radio in the car. Oh my goodness. This is not the thing to be listening to while driving. I happened to have on the Vision (New Age music) channel and this came on in broad noon daylight as I was running some errands. Within minutes, I was as calm as a lake on a windless day and heading for nod-off time. Change the channel..but quick, make a note of the album.I tried it (safely) at home. It has a warning; do not operate machinery or drive while listening to this cd. It does really work. I put it in the cd player in my alarm clock and put it on low before I went to bed. I think I fell asleep in 4 minutes.The trick is the slow tempo. The music is almost complete phrases, no discernable tune but also not simply noises that sound spacey.If you want something effective to calm yourself during yoga, to sleep to or to calm a fussy baby or put down the toddlers, this is it. Zzzzzz"
5,Puts me to sleep.,"If I listen to this lying down, I only make it to the 2nd or third section. Very relaxing."
5,Best Sleep Therapy,This is by far the best Sleep album I have heard. Soothing and harmonious it gently takes you on a journey into bliss!!! Wonderful and highly recommended - in fact all 8 CDs by Liquid Mind are fulfilling perfectly all the needs of different aspects of Stress-relief.
5,In perfect harmony!,"Not much to add to the previous review except to remark on the fantastic sensitivity all the musicians on the wonderful record exhibit towards each other. The more I listen to this, the more I am struck by the fact that whether Flora is singing or someone else is playing a solo, the other musicians are all doing EXACTLY the right thing behind them. Apart from its artistic/inspirational qualities, it is a long time since I heard anything quite this well crafted."
3,Visually Blurred!,"This camera packs a lot of features into a small little camera. However, the focus issue is HUGE for me. I have little ones that I'm always photographing, and the auto focus issue doesn't cut it for us. Family photo taking? This camera isn't for you. Even using auto focus mode (battery draining indeed), and using a flash indoors, you will take several pictures before achieving a sharp picture. In the meantime, your subjects will be temporarily blinded by the ""red light"". (A big complaint from our family). Not too great for those impromptu moments of catching your children's smiles and ""firsts"" on camera.After reading the other reviews, I think this one is not a keeper for us. On a positive note, it does allow the experienced photographer to venture out of the ""box"", more so than most digitals."
3,great pictures when it works,"bought this camera to replace a DX series Kodak.My thoughts:- I was excited, at first, by the manual controls, but disappointed by the difficulty of using the pre-set modes when in a hurry (who wants manual all the time?). The option for pre-setting 4 ""my mode"" settings is great, though.- The color results are not impressive, I frequently find myself changing saturation and reshooting.- Battery life is not great and the battery is very expensive. You will need at least one extra at $35 a shot. Also inconventient for international travel.- Finally, On two trips I have lost pictures when the camera has malfunctioned. Refuses to turn on and/or erases the XD card.- Did I mention the good picture quality? When the camera works and the saturation is controlled, the pictures are great.I have had the camera for 2 months now and it is on its way back to the store. Good thing membership warehouses have generous return policies."
4,Olympus C-7000 by Film Guy,This camera has most of the features of my two well equipped Nikon FE's. It is a supplement and learning tool. Pluses: light; one unit not twenty; mostly complete; macro to tele; good price. Minuses: too small for my XXX hands (made a handle); No print manual; media & battery propritery. Has lived up to its promise and grows as I learn. Has usual CCD low contrast but I compensate easily. Would like to use filters but that's for the replacement camera.
5,A must CD for Serious collectors of Vangelis Music!,Vassilis Saleas performs familiar Vangelis compositions with haunting clarinet arrangements that don't violate the original soul and feel of the Vangelis scores. A must CD for any serious collector of Vangelis music!.
3,Not much new information or analysis,"Most leftists will be familiar with almost all of the information in Robert Pollin's book. From the rightist nature of Clinton's policies, to the fact that most people's standard of living didn't improve much in the 1990s, to the failure of neoliberalism in India, Argentina, and other nations.Some bits are interesting. He refutes various circular explanations of why a large bubble developed in the 1990s and provides a good interpretation. The information on the farmer suicides in India will be new to most readers.At the outset he outlines the ""Marx Problem"" the ""Keynes Problem"" and the ""Polanyi Problem"" but these concepts are hardly used throughout the book.This book is only recommended for young leftists (or foreigners, since most of the book is on the U.S.) who have not yet learned much about the U.S. economy and international neoliberalism. To all others it will be redundant."
3,Fun at the beginning - can frustrate younger players,"I bought this game for my 4 and 6 year old to play on a long trip as it looked like something my 4 year could have some success at. After the first couple of sequences, where you herd the sheep, it gets rather difficult. I, as an adult, enjoy the game, but it can get a little frustrating for my younger son as he can't get very far without needing some help."
1,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Someone out there find the contributors to this ""Tribute"" album and beat them up. Please?"
4,Not for the FNM fans...,"I'm a big FNM fan, but I'm also a fan of underground industrial/metal.And as already a big fan of such bands as Hate Dept., Bile and Medulla Nocte I knew what I was getting myself into. And I was pleased with what I found.For a while now underground industrial labels have been doing tribute albums (Cleopatra Records being the main contender). The trouble is these compilations aren't aimed at the bands they're 'tributing' but at the fans of the bands performing. Unfortunately it means fans of the original band will pick it up and be disappointed with what they find.If you like underground industrial... give this a try.If you like FNM... think twice."
2,Buy the originals instead,"I never could understand why anybody would buy a tribute album. The only explanation that comes to my mind is to add one more piece to a collection of records... But never listen to it.I confess that I have only listened to samples of the songs, but except for some of them (Imbue's ""Gentle Art"" comes to my mind, and is one reason for 2 stars rather than one), all tunes are totally rip-offs, no arrangements, no personality injected, no added value. Just basic covers.If you didn't know Faith No More before, then buy the original albums instead, or at list the greates hits if you're broke.If you know Faith No More already, you know what I'm talking about for sure. Don't waste your money."
1,Sucks,"I bought this album and it sucked so much.When I threw it out my window, listening itsplatter on the ground sounded better then th album"
1,worst tribute ever,"I sat there listening to this CD and thought to myself this is the worst attempt at ""re-doing"" any group of songs ever let alone Faith No More songs. Did Mike Patton have any say over this or was this a cheap label decision aimed at making a few bucks? There should be a disclaimer on the cover that says, "" This CD Sucks!"""
1,SIMPLY DISGUSTING!,"I'm really sorry for sincerety..but this album is simply DISGUSTING! How can Faith No More, one of the biggest bands of 90', be tributed with bad arranged songs, lack of creativity and so bad taste? I hope that a TRUE TRIBUTE can be released in the future. My favorite band can't be shamed with this ..."
1,I WILL PAY YOU NOT TO LISTEN TO THIS,"Cut off both your hands, boil your head in oil for a week and trap your genitals in a vice for a month. It's still more pleasant than this. A horrid attempt to cash in on the FNM name. Absolutely the worst set of covers I've ever heard. Possibly the worst album ever. Absolute [poop]. Need I go on?"
1,"Not just awful, but God-awful...","Why aren't there ""0"" stars?When I saw this CD I bought it on the spot, no questions asked. With FNM being the source material, and there being 2 discs worth of covers, there had to be AT LEAST ONE GOOD SONG, RIGHT!? Not so. I would have to be suspicious as to whether or not any of these ""bands"" even exist, or if one guy with a keyboard sampler and an iMac got a few friends to sing into his computer. Each song sounds the same- cheesy techno beat, bad vocals that are poorly produced. The only difference is the voice. Please do not buy this, ever, for any price. This is the worst CD I have ever bought, and I hate myself for it. Okay, that was too much. I still can't get over how bad this is- 2 cd's just make it twice as bad."
3,The game needs to be more intense.,The Game would be a lot better if it were a fighting game. N64 should release a fighting game containg all the monsters frome the Japanese Godzilla series. Does anyone else think the way I do?
4,"Interesting; a triple, not a home run.","The writing style is light and enjoyable and the author reveals a lot of interesting concepts being generated by contemporary physics. There are also some interestting incites into Torah; but, as far as unifying Torah with modern physics there is still a bit of a way to go at the present time. Dr. Goldfinger does give it a good try though.In my opinion the definitive work in this area remains Gerald Schroeder's Genesis and the Big Bang."
4,I wish I had this tool when I first sought a diagnosis...,"Having been through the medical maze to find the correct diagnosis for my illness, Fibromyalgia Syndrome, I have learned the hard way how to ""micro-manage"" my health.If this book had been available when I began my journey, I think I would have been able to eliminate a lot of time spent on the heart-ache of mis-communication, and expectations that weren't realized.The ""insider tips"" and the forms would have been invaluable in communicating with the plethora of medical specialists I had to see to get a correct diagnosis.Thank you for this book!"
4,Kitty Smells gone quick,"While teaching a class a cat peed in the living room - we had to get rid of the smell - a student suggested this, I was skeptical - prime and this saved the day. the next day is was pure!"
2,Contains perfume,"If you have asthma or chemical sensitivity, you may have difficulty with this product. It contains about 1% perfume. It also contains propylene glycol, benzene (DB45 Calfax), and kerosene (CDA Formula 19). Ingredients can be found at: [...]"
4,Recommendation for Fundamental of Clinical Chemistry textbook,The book is well written and easy to follow and understand. The only thing I would have liked to see is a section with review questions and answers with detailed explanations to assist you in understanding the topics better. I would recommend this book to other students to use as a review or additonal information source.
5,Great Seller,"This seller did an excellent job shipping the book in time for class. It is in really great shape and very much appreciated. No marks, no bad odors, perfect shape. Thanks for the book, it has been well received."
4,great shoes,"I bought these shoes when I got pregnant because I wanted more stability than my clogs. They are great. I can slip them on easily without bending over and they are comfortable all day. The only thing is that one of them is splitting at a seem. But I bought mine at a discount store for about $14, and I settled for half a size smaller than what I wear. I have the green ones and can't find a replacement, but I think they're worth the price."
1,waste of money,The product is a waste of money. I put it on the DS and now the screen looks worse than ever before.
5,good deal,good deal for a must have to protect your screen. no scratches easy to install and it got here quickly
5,Thank you for these covers!!,"The Nintendo DS that these were purchased for belongs to my 4 yr old son, so these are an excellent idea."
4,ok,The product was good but could have come with more instruction. You have to remove film from both sides.review given by my son
2,Nintendo DS Lite Screen Covers,i have to say that i wasn't satisfied with this product. there were no instructions because the packaging was in Japanese...
3,Haunting voice from afar,"It's the alluring yet haunting voice from afar that you might imagine leading you out of a dark forest where you have been lost and hungry for days. The sound nourishes, comforts and persuades, yet almost frightens you with its uncommon beauty. It's the voice of Azam Ali. The lead vocalist from the world music group Vas has embarked on a solo project of reinterpreting traditional Latin, Sephardic, French and Arabic sacred, folk and love songs from the 12th through 14th centuries. Medieval string instruments plucked with the rhythms of 14th century musicians reincarnated in the 21st century, period instruments such as the hurdy-gurdy and vielle and passionate percussive beats blend peacefully, creating an atmospheric, aural enchantment that will lead you into a new founded musical enlightenment. A portion of proceeds from the album will support RAWA (Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan)."
3,"Good voice, diction problem","While the vocals on this album are quite good, unfortunately, the pronunciation and the diction of Azam Ali are faulty to the extreme. She certainly neither sounds French nor Latin and even her Arabic is problematic on the piece originally by Soeur Marie Keyrouz whose work I am very familiar with. Actually that piece is the worst piece in the whole album and it would be much better to listen to the good sister herself since Azam's vocal ornementations are really not Arabic sounding. The problem with this album is that it sounds again like another Vas album in the same self-made language that she has sung before in the past and with the same arrangements. I am a big lover of early music and it is very important to treat with more respect and research and more elocution practice such classical works."
5,Beautiful,"Azam Ali has a beautiful voice. This artist came to my attention with the ""Children of Dune"" movie on the Sci-fi Channel. Her voice was so mystifying. I love this CD!!! If only artist like Azam Ali were mainstream in pop music, not no-talent-look-pretty ""singers"" like Jessica Simpson or Britney Spears."
4,trying hard,"It took a lot of guts to make this CD, surveying as it does such a large geographical range of historically remote Medieval traditions. I like the results: logical but ethereal, and respecting both learning and yearning. Contrary to at least one of the other reviewers, I think the backing arrangements are just fine, contributing positively to the overall effect. Alas, there is just one problem: I don't think Azam Ali's voice is, strictly from a technical point of view, *quite* up to the challenge. But for this, this might have been a sensational CD, but as it is it is merely a good one. P.S.: Azam, I have always loved the way you play hammered dulcimer--might we hear more of this in the future, please??"
3,"Not bad, could have been better","I've admired Vas for some time, particularly their first album, and so was looking forward to this. As a recording, it has its good points, to be sure. Azam's voice can be amazing, enchanting, and hypnotic. Her guest musicians are excellent.But I have to agree with several of the lukewarm reviews here. She is not doing ""pure"" early music, and that's fine. Her arrangements are tasteful, and even respectful, but her pronunciations are often very strange and suggest lack of knowledge, rather than creative interpretation.Albums don't have to have a theme, but one of my big problems with this album is that it lacks an identity. It's like a smorgasbord of pieces from all over medieval Europe and the Middle East, seemingly chosen at random and put on the album in the most haphazard and unplanned manner. And yet, there is a sameness to many of the pieces, suggesting lack of arranging ability.So, perhaps borrow it from a friend first before you buy."
5,Works for me!,"Haven't had a chance to read all of this book yet. But, in skimming through it I know I'll keep it and read it more than once. Definitely good for helping me develope my spirituality! Love Edgar Cayce readings!"
5,a Must read,I think that this is a must read. I loved this book as a child and I loved it even more as an adult. The book is an easy read but still makes you think. Wish that more had been made. I couldn't put them down until I finished all three in the series
3,Needs more tracks!!!,"The set is adorable and quite durable... the problem is it doesn't come with enough tracks to actually connect them. Nothing worse than a happy, excited child being reduced to tears because he can't make the goldmine look like the box because Mom needs to drive 25 miles to buy some extra tracks."
2,"Very short, and not very interesting","Like another reviewer said, this was mainly footage of the Beatles arriving at various airports. I had a headache after I watched it, from listening to all the young girls screaming!There are two Beatles DVDs with the same title ""The Beatles Around the World"". I had thought I was getting a concert DVD, but ended up with this one. Make sure to read the description carefully before buying. The DVD cover pictures are different too."
5,Great Album...One of there Best,"I am very impressed with this group of musician's. They have really found that MTB sound and have made one of there most compelete albums of the bands career. I think that Chris Hicks songwriting has really helped this album take a direction, Just as Toy Caldwell used to do. And Doug Gray himself and the rest of the band really shine. So if you are an MTB fan this is definitely an album not to ignore. Also check out Chris Hicks solo Funcky Broadway...awesome album....I am fastly becoming a fan of his. MTB keep it going you guy's have really found that magic."
1,It's Not the Same sound,"While I'm a huge fan of boys from their early beginnings, admittedly I haven't been keeping up the releases of late. I see Doug Gray as the soul member. An important member with that strong, distinct voice. But, Gray's voice has changed. The only time I heard his pure voice of the past are in the ballads. The rest was damn near unrecognizable. The songs are OK, but they do lack any kind of magic or chemistry. This might as well be a tribute band with similar sounding country rock songs."
2,Please Do NOT Fall for the Propaganda,"Folks,It is plain and simple; the current band using the Marshall Tucker Band offers only ONE of the original band's lineup: vocalist Doug Gray. While some of these current members may very well be fine musicians in their own right, they are NOT the Marshall Tucker Band. Just listen to the samples and that will be all you need to hear to make your own opinion. By the way, the ""reviewer"" who has the long, overblown revue is a closely-associated person to the current band and has a vested interest interest in seeing them succeed. For him to call this current CD offering his favorite Marshall Tucker offering is just plain idiotic!Long live the memories of the original and TRUE Marshall Tucker Band and especially the souls of Toy & Tommy Caldwell. Rest in peace dear brothers."
2,Not up to par,"The guy from Tennessee below seems to have it right. Listening to the samples was enough to tell me that this is not the MTB sound I look forward to and have enjoyed for many years. There are slight hints of the MTB sound in the samples but not enough for me. Get ""Stompin'Room Only"" - MTB at its finest and as it should be heard - jammin' and rockin' live."
5,Not bad for sugar free,"I have a very sweet tooth and I wanted sugar free candy to keep my glucose level low. I expected the candy to taste ""a little off"", and it does, but it did satisfy my cravings for taffy. The only problem I had was that the chews are very soft. I would advise storing the candy in a cool place. I think if you actually like sugar free products, this may not be so bad. And like most sugar free products there is an aftertaste."
1,Sorbee Sugar Free Fruit Burst Fruit Chews,These have an awful taste - they taste like something rotten. I would never buy them again. I don't know what to do with the ones I have. No one will eat them!
4,Very polished but lacks the Slavic fervor,"I love Entremont and have many of his recordings. Of the many copies of the concertos this one is near the top but it seems to possess that French polish rather that a Slavic heat. It is almost too smooth, too easy but I will say that the sound is grand and in the ""old style"". Very enjoyable recording."
5,The best book about edibles - ever!,"I bought this book when it was first published in 1980 as a Christmas gift to my folks. Last year after moving my mom, she asked if I would like to keep it. I thought it would be fun to look at, but I had no idea what an incredible resource it is!A-Z, if it is edible, it is in here. Complete with a wonderful historical write up for major entries. This is in my opinion the ultimate resource for edible objects.I highly recommend ""Food""!"
4,H310 Floormate,Floormate is a great product for cleaning hard surfaces.It sure beats the old bucket and mop. Works great on tile and hardwood floors. It's the second one I have owned.The model is priced right as well.
4,"Good - don't expect miracles, but it works :)","Bottom-line: My floors are clean and no left-over residue. It doesn't clean them on it's own, however it gets the job done. Since my entire house is tile, this little helper comes it handy."
4,Great Concept--Minor Flaw,"The SpinScrub does all that it advertises--it was easy to assemble, and lightweight to use. It's true that the spinning brushes don't quite get into those textured crevices on vinyl but overall, it does a good job. Unfortunately, I had to return mine due only to the fact that I'm currently having to use a 'walker' to get around & the dirty-water cup needed frequent emptying...on my part, that meant either stopping to take the cup to a sink or pushing a bucket around with me. For someone who is less limited, I would recommend the SpinScrub for cleaning your hard-surface floors. The long cord assures coverage of a wide area, the noise level is acceptable & it's easy to refill the clean water tank. I also liked the cleaning solution that came with the SpinScrub---nice fresh smell. Another great factor of this machine is that there's little or no water left on the floor--it leaves the floor practically dry after use. Overall, a very good product with minor drawbacks..."
1,Wasted,"It's does not vac at all. I am going to get a canister vac like my friends from Eurica, they worked great. Uprights are always too loud and does not clean well. My only good vac was the upright that's cordless. It does not clean very well, but does the everyday job of picking up dirt. My ex-wife got it and still using it. I need to get one. Wasted hundreds on Hoover and Dirt Devil's upright too. Purchase 3 Hoover in my life time and are not happy. 3 strikes, your out Hoover. I'll get a Eureka canister vac for sure."
3,"Okay, but not Great!","I've had the floormate plus for over a year now and it is still working well.Pros: No dirty mop water. Works great on Hardwood floors. Virtually no wet spots on floors. Easy to use.Cons: If you have tile/Ceramic floors with grout... forget the brushes getting in there to clean. That is a huge con for me, because the grout needs to be clean. Doesn't get into corners well. Mine also Leaks occasionally. Loud. Heavy. Not crazy about cleaning solution.If the brushes were more powerful in getting to the grout, I would be very pleased."
4,Sony Receivers,I took a look and used the Sony STR-DA333ES and it is a very good products. But if you are looking for a Sony reciever you might also want to check of the Sony STR-DA555ES which has 120 watts opposed to 80 watts. Also another thing the 555 has is that is has the 2 way remote which is alot better in controlling everything. But if you don't need the extra watts and you don't care about the remote I highly recommand this product.
4,Sony Str-DA333ES review,"I actually found this receiver in the garbage on my street. I picked it up, brought it home and it had no power. Shocked to see it was an ES receiver and some dumb person tossed it, I looked it over. It had a bad fuse and a bad ground. 10 mins and a trip to radio shack, I had it working and saved it from a landfill.Overall it's a nice amp. Doesn't compare to my DA3000ES amp, but it's nice."
2,Very small respect to a normal person's head,its not covering the ears and also at the same time just come over the upper part f the ear giving it a very weird look. I will suggestto buy it for kids only
2,Pretty but fell out easily,These earrings are gorgeous. But I only go to wear them for a day because they fell out somewhere along the way.
2,Very Misleading,They spend very little time with the older couples. Most of the video is spent listening to young couple who barely know anything about the ups and downs of Marriage life... I've seen more substance on Daytime TV.
5,Wonderful couples,Great advice! I hoped the advice of the older couples was going to give me some ideas for my marriage (and they did!!) but I liked hearing the young couples too. I know the ups and downs my girlfriends have gone through with their marriages but hearing these young couples who I don't even know saying the same things I would say was really helpful. That was what got my husband to watch. That there was a fireman talking about his marriage. And God Bless the older couples for sharing what they have done in their marriages.
1,Eats batteries like there is no tomorrow!!!!!,"It is a mouse. . .what more is there to say. . .It seems to work OK, except when the batteries are low(which is QUITE OFTEN!!!) Luckily, I already had a battery charger and rechargeable batteries to use with this thing. . .Belkin should at least be honest with the persons who will be buying this and prepare them for the cold hard facts of life. Of course, that would probably mean NO ONE would ever buy the darned thing! And, that's probably the way it should be. . .Crappy products should NOT be on the market and reputable companies recognize that! Oh, did I just say that Belkin is NOT reputable??? Well, it's often found that we REALLY say what we mean when we do make ""a slip of the tongue!"" [In this case, a slip of the finger! And, in this case, I give the product ONE FINGER. . .and, you can choose the finger!]"
1,"tried for fibro, resulted in terrible foot cramps","I got this from an acupuncturist for fibromyalgia pain. I used for a few days with no noticeable improvement when I began getting severe cramping in my feet, usually on the top. I have a very physical job so I was not certain of the cause but I discontinued use since I had no positive results. I recently tried Zeel again for two days and the foot cramping has returned."
3,"Not Vegetarian, definitely not vegan","I just thought I should put it out there that this product is NOT vegetarian, which is a great shame, as I'm sure it will conflict with many the lifestyle of those who take it or would like to use zeel to treat their aches and pains. I have not used Zeel, this is not a review on the product, I'm just expressing my disappointment"
5,Zeel,Awesome price compared to vet's cost... Dog appears to be doing much better per 2 crushed under tongue twice a day for 2 months and then 1 crushed under tongue once a day foe maintenance...
3,"Good Product, Slow Delivery","The product is fine. Company states on Amazon site that delivery is 2-3 days, when in actuality it was not in stock and took a couple of weeks to obtain. This can be an issue when you are buying a pain relief product. We bought this on the recommendation of our wholistic vet for our very crippled arthritic dog, so it was very dissappointing not to have it as soon as we expected. We would have ordered elsewhere had we known at the outset that it would take so long to arrive."
5,Haven't missed a hair yet!,These tweezers take the pain out of tweezing. Their grip is excellent and you don't have to keep repositioning to get a good effect. Well worth the expense.
3,Navy flat,"I desperately needed a blue flat when I bought this shoe. It's very comfortable and durable, but I'm not thrilled with the design."
1,Moss Out - Algae In,I bought Moss Out to remove the dark algae strecks on my roof. Moss Out did absolutley nothing in removing the algae. My neighbor also bought the product and had the same results.Don't waste your money.
5,This third book finishes the trilogy perfectly,"Now that I have all the books, I applaud the author for a great story. Each book complements the others, and all are a superb story line and very engaging characters. I highly recommend all three to anyone."
5,Another masterpiece from Sharon Sala!,"At long last, the final book in the Justice Way series is here, and boy, was it worth the wait! Hats off to Sharon Sala for another job well done!"
4,Another schmaltzy pleasure,"The vocoder revival continues! This album captures the quintessential 1970s/space/drugs/glam sound. But it's more vivid and rich than you remembered it, thanks to modern production. It's like stepping into a holographic Milton Glaser poster, like watching Yellow Submarine in surround-sound Dolby THX. Beatle-y mellotron and trumpet abound, as do soft Donovan/Nick Drake/Belle & Sebastian vocal stylings. Touchstones include Air, ELO, Cassius, even (gulp) Alan Parsons. ""Paris Sous La Neige"" could be this year's ""Sexy Boy."""
4,Perfect Colors,"This first tract ""Perfect Colors"" is a beautiful song. Mellow singing with occasional hard hitting electric guitar. Track 6 and 11I are awesome and eccentric."
1,Very disappointing.,"I bought this thinking it was about hiking the Appalachain Trail as I'm always hunting for hiking ideas and/or inspiration. Mary Twitty has a very folksy writing style, but what bothered me more was that at the end of each chapter I said to myself ""who cares"". I found little in the way of new hiking ideas, hiking guidance or hiking inspiration in any of the chapters. For inspiration on the Appalachain Trail, I much prefered the books by Ross, Berger or Setzer. As far as a diary of the hike, I find many of the internet on-line thru-hiker diaries better."
5,This book blew my mind,"This book really blew my mind on many different levels. The ties to Manson are fascinating and really make sense. The main thing that really blew my mind though was that the police were so eager to make an arrest that they just pinned everything on Berkowitz, even though the facts did not add up whatsoever. I highly recommend this book to any true crime reader."
5,BEST TRUE CRIME NOVEL EVER!!,"If people knew the truth about the Son Of Sam killings most would probably refuse to believe. This book is eye-opening and truly terrifying. The police just wanted this case to go away and the amount of evidence they ignored is staggering. I was a kid in The Bronx at the time and I remember how scared my parents were. We couldn't even play outside. The first victim, Donna Lauria, was killed in The Bronx, but not until I read this book did I know she was killed 2 blocks from my house. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
3,Great research on the past . . . but what about the present?,"Maury Terry has obviously spent a great deal of time researching the David Berkowitz of the 70s, in his book, The Ultimate Evil. I've yet to find a book about the David Berkowitz of today. The best read I've found is in David's online journal, at www.forgivenforlife.com."
2,The Ultimate Evil,"I read this book several years ago. The first thing I must say is that ""facts"" as depicted, if this book is by any means true, should get support from specific, traceable external documentation and copious notes. Though it does make a few references to New York Times articles from the 1980s (which I admit I have not verified), those are all Terry uses to directly substantiate his claims. A book of this scope having not so much as an index leaves too much for this critically thinking mind to question. TUE is a fantastic read, but that alone offers no credibility. Detectives who investigated the Son of Sam case have debunked any grand link between Berkowitz and alleged occult affiliations, but of course, I hear people saying, ""The cops want to prevent panic!"" Is Terry's account true? I do not know. I am, however, very skeptical."
5,The best of the best,"This was great. There are some songs on here that are not available on the other CDs, so it was really nice to have those and this includes a song book as well. The only problem was that the lads have done so many great renditions of various songs, that it would be impossible to get them all on one cd! But the editors chose well. Even though I have the other 3 albums, this one was a welcome addition."
5,The Very Best of the Irish Tenors is just that!,"This recording is wonderful. Ronan's ""last Rose of summer"" is unique, the Percy French medley shows all three in great voice, Finbar's Maggie is wonderful and the laurels have to go to Anthony for his magnificent rendition of ""She moved through the fair"", wow!!!!Well worth buying.Isaac Chute"
5,Just got your Kleenex,"I suggest a box of Kleenex for each person in the room when you play this CD or VHS recording. Mom won't let me play it anymore because she...well, you know what I mean."
3,"Love Tenors, especially Irish and Italian","I like any kind of music, but I especially like to hear tenors sing. I was somewhat disappointed, though, because this seems not to be made in the recording studio but at a concert because some of the songs have clapping at the end. I wish I had read that when I looked it up. I prefer studio recordings. I was very disappointed with the recording of my favorite song of all time ""Danny Boy"", but all in all the CD is not bad. Most likely when I listen to it several more times it will grow on me like it is already starting to do."
4,Ginger cookies,"This book is worth the price for the ginger cookies alone. I don't remember what she calls them, but she makes them with a full tablespoon of ground ginger and a generous amount of molasses. They are the best ginger-molasses cookies I've ever had. I ate dozen after dozen of them when I was pregnant with my son. I can't wait to buy this book again. I got rid of it when I moved, and I've always regretted that."
5,Wonderful Intro to Cooking,"Learning to Cook with Marion CunninghamExcellent book for the beginner cook. Many basics are included such as how to cut an onion, tips on buying produce, how to carve a chicken, etc. Pictures are included for more detailed tasks. The recipes are delicious and written simply. This book helped me get over my anxiety of cooking with its clearly written instructions and hints."
3,Unsatisfactory,"First of all, I am no cook. A busy lifestlye keeps me from spending more money on takeout food, and less time in the kitchen. When attempting to make an effort to amend that, I bought this book eagerly, based on the previous reviews.Perhaps it was me screwing up the recipe (as I've said, I am no cook), but out of the 5 recipes I've tried in this book, only 1 of them was passable...barely, and 2 which were trashworthy. Additionally, the recipes weren't very healthy, relying on way too much butter and oil. I am very disappointed, as I thought that this book was geared for novices and had easy, but good instruction.Some of the material is alright. The informational charts and hints are helpful. But, I am no longer sure if I trust the recipes though. It is a waste of time and money to continue investing in something that produces an inferior product. Hopefully others will have better results"
5,Add this book to your cookbook library now!,"I bought this book simply to complete my Marion Cunningham collection, but instantly found myself cooking my way through the recipes. There is something between these covers for all cooks, not just beginners. An added bonus is the way Marion's warmth and patience comes through on every page. She is truly a national treasure."
1,bad description,"had to return item. description says it was for 5x4.5 bolt pattern vehicle to 5x4.75 bolt pattern on wheel, but it didnt fit, was the opposite of what it stated."
3,Slayers gets better with each series ...,"Slayers TRY has better art, fight sequencing and coloring then the previous two series, however, the plots still seem unmotivated and contrived. The characters stack up like cord wood yet again. Within 3 episodes, we have a bloated ensemble of a main cast which provide some pretty funny and believable interaction. I was pleasantly surprised by the snappy fighting; they finally cut out the ponderous power-up dialogue! Not a bad series for younger kids and teens, except that the main cast kills lots of innocent people and never seems to care. A real disappoinment are the 'monster' designs which are merely people with green skin or a horn on their head. Xellos appears in the end of the tape and spruces up the stories with his usual vague detachment. OK anime for anyone wanting a 90 minute bizarro adventure."
5,My review for 48 days.,This book came in excellent condition. I have not read this yet. But I was pleased with how quick the book came and how well the condition the book came. I always order my books used.
1,Never Received!!!,"I Have never received my book and it has been a long time, still waiting. . . . . . ."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"Don't waste your time or money on this book. Dan Miller tells you what to do but not how to do it. Everyone knows the common sense advice. But does Dan Miller give some new insight, approach or technique? No.It's really just a front for self-advertisement of his other services and web site. Well Dan, I already bought the book and wasted enough money. And I'm looking for my refund...Don't even get me started on the crappily edited CD-Rom that came with it. It sounds like Miller's 12 year old nephew taped and edited it in his basement on his boom box. Run, don't walk, over to What Color is My Parachute. Now that is a book worth reading!"
5,Great Reference,"This was an outstanding book. I am still a year or more away from my job change. However, this tome gave me direction and options that I never thought of. I totally agree with his premise that we look for the wrong things in our job search."
2,48 days to the work you love,"Shame on Dave Ramsey for writing the forward to this book. It puts a tarnish his strong reputation.I found this book to be very disappointing--highly disorganized, mostly theoretical, and filled with little more than a few golden nuggets per chapter.I will look elsewhere for a more useful job-hunting book."
2,Didn't love it,"It's such a great concept I know and I really wanted to love this book but alas, I didn't. Think about your life and what you're doing. The amount of money you need to support your family and then think, can I afford to do what I love? After reading several book in this genre I decided that the time for me to do what I love is in my free time and when I retire. For now, there are very real decisions to make and what I would love to do is only going to have me driving a '73 AMC Pacer to my studio apartment and people, that's not what I want to be doing. I do appreciate the sentiment Mr. Miller conveys but just don't find it to me applicable to the average american..."
4,Great book so far!,"I started reading this book a couple of weeks ago, and so far I like it a lot. It has been very eye opening to me and is helping me draft a long term plan for the work I love!"
4,Find Yourself,"I would recommend this book to anyone that is taking a look at their current job, pursuing a new job, or making a paradigm shift in their career. Dan Miller points out the risk and rewards when using your given skills, values, dreams and passions. The most impressive aspects of the book are reading about people that have made a paradigm shift in their lives and found work in an entirely different profession. Miller reminds us of changes in the work force. Many jobs that will serve many folks do not even exist. Finally, Miller concludes with some deep thoughts about recognizing what you have and making the best out of any situation. I enjoyed the book and have used parts to make better decisions in my workplace."
1,Do Not Waste Your Time,"This book was a lot of Christian ""fluff"" with no substance (Christian or otherwise). There are no steps. There is no plan. Do not waste your time or your money."
3,"Content fine, will not play on car CD player","Disappointed that the format won't work in the car CD player. Had to copy to CD's via computer to solve the problem. Otherwise, the content is great!"
1,i didn't read it. 'twas a gift to another!,"my son, the recipient of the book, found it lacking in what he expected the content to be. that doesn't mean that the book wouldn't offer valuable insight to others."
3,So Close!,"If you're looking for a book that will, BANG knock you right over the head look on. I read this book over a couple of days, it was well written. It has been about a two months since I read 48 days and I can not remember a single point from it. Oh yeah and it's preachy. Had I read 48 Days earlier in my life, it may have very proven very helpful. However if Mr. Miller was to write another book I would wait for the paperback."
3,not useful *for me*,"I rarely read self-help books, but this one was recommended by our pastor during a Sunday service I attended in the midst of a job crisis. Unfortunately, I found it less useful for my career as a teacher and nanny than for those in the corporate world. Worth checking out from the library, though, for the appendixes: sample resumes and business letters, recommended reading, etc."
2,very disappointed in this book. all hype!,"I was hoping that this book would be this answer or at least point me in the right direction. well it seemed to be doing that in the first few chapters then all of a sudden it was a book about how to impress an interviewer and write a resume to find a J O B which is what I thought the entire premise of the book wasn't suppose to be about. it was suppose to help you find that calling in life that will truly make you happy and life worth while. it talked about how unhappy people are if they aren't living their callling and blah blah but offered little practical advice to finding it. so I'm back to square one. but if you are looking for statistics on employers, how to impress at a job interview and how to write a resume then it's ok. if you're looking for inside to yourself. go elsewhere!"
4,Good Starting Point,"This book is a good starting point if you are looking for a new career. It is helpful to get you started thinking, and I recommmend to continue to do the activities on his website after you finish the book."
4,Worked for me!,"I loved this book! It was the inspiration I needed to go after a career field I had been too nervous to enter into. I just went for it and landed my ""dream job"" within two months of reading the book! I would recommend it to anyone who is nervous about switching careers and who needs that extra motivation to do it."
4,Some Good Advice,"Take all these kinds of books as what they are -- one person's opinion. Take what applies to you and disregard the rest. This one has some good underlying principles that work -- and some applications and generalities that don't.I had to over-look a few of his personal methods to retain the big picture. It's a good thing for motivation and goal setting. Many of his techniques will work for many people, but not for others. I'm not a ""hard sell"" person, and will have to adapt some of his principles to fit my personality and methods. But I can do that.But if the reader takes what works for them and adapts his principles to their job search, I think it's a worthwhile read."
2,Faith based viewpoint,"I wish I had known this was so religiously based. I am trying to get past that and get some useful information, which I think might be there. The first couple of pages mention God at least 6 times, and later in the book it gets more prevalent, quoting scripture, etc.Maybe some good info, just with I had had a heads up."
5,48 Days to the Work You Love,This book provides many practical and very helpful approaches to finding a good job. I had just lost a job that I loved for 28 years and needed a refresher to help me find another job to love. I found the book very helpful.
1,Not Thrilled,"I'm not thrilled with either the book or customer service (which happens to be the author's daughter).To me, the book is geared more to the person who is completely able to work outside the home. I am not able so this book was not really relevant to my situation.I also bought the 48 days tests because they made it sound like the tests could point me in the right direction but the results were pretty much the same as any where else - I think the possible jobs the test pointed me to were all of the jobs available in the world.Oh well, on to something else..."
3,New Reviewer,"I found this book somewhat helpful, but I also found the old standby ""What Color is Your Parachute?"" more complete and more helpful. If I had to choose between the two, I'd go with the latter because it is goes into more detail. It also gives a variety of websites for interest tests and the like without the extra self-promotion found in this book."
3,Didn't Help Find Work I Love.,The book is good at telling you to get after it and gives good advice for finding and getting a job. I don't feel like it helped me choose a career field. My goal was to find a book that would help me discover the best career for me. Miller tells you to go to his website to take a quiz that will help you find the best career; only problem is he charges $28 for the quiz.!
3,Not bad but...,"Gives you some things to think about, but not what I was expecting. Would be a good book if you're also working with a career counselor while reading."
3,"Some good information, but overall a let down from the hype","Bought this based on Dave Ramsey's constant recommendations. The book is half work philosophy and half job hunting tips. I enjoyed the first part, but found the latter boring."
4,A useful guide,A well written and uplifting book with a simple revelation - work shouldn't be just a job. Take the time to remember your passions in life and seek a way to apply them.
3,Contains a lot of interesting anecdotes,"This book was recommended by Dave Ramsey as a great book to read if you have questions about finding the work you love.It does contain a lot of interesting anecdotes, but I was disappointed by the amount of actual information in it. Maybe I just didn't read it closely enough, but I found myself simply not caring to read one short story after another about so-and-so's fictional life."
4,"I've read it, appreciated it, then used it multiple times.","This is a great book for anyone considering a job change. It goes far beyond that however and leads you to discover what you want to ""be"". Each of us have God-given talents and passions. Our lives are so much more fulfilling if we find work that is matched to those talents and passions. Dan also shares ways to be proactive and professional when searching I have now used it during a second jobchange event. This is one of my dependable resources."
2,A Mixed Bag,"My purchase of this book was based on Dave Ramsey's recommendation. While I thought the book was somewhat motivational and gave some useful ideas, it did not really deliver what perhaps I was expecting. My job search took a little over 48 days and I cannot say that I referred to the ook everyday during the search.I believe that while it may be good for some who are geared to some occupations and have some particular skill sets, it is not for all. So, while I am sure it has sold many books, partially due to Mr. Ramsey's recommendation, it is clearly not the panacea that one might be searching for. You still must find a job based on what you have done in the past and convince a new employer that you can make him money. Or you must start your own business based on your abilities and desires. Mr. Miller's book may or may not be of assistance to you."
1,Worth neither the time nor money,"This book essentially turned out to be a hardcover advertisement to buy more of the author's material in order to ""really discover the work you love.""It eluded to proving helpful for a moment with discovering more about ones potential vocation, but then gave YET ANOTHER reference to his website where you could purchase the information for another $37.50.The minor amount of basic material is the same as can be found on most any career counseling website, but with constant advertisements for the author's other 7 streams of income along with gratuitous religious references to fill up space as well as repetition of the same information and quotes....it quickly becomes beyond annoying.I do not often rate books negatively; however, save your money with this fluff. I recommend that you peruse it in the book store first and you will quickly find that it is a waste of time, money and effort."
3,Needs an Update,"A mingled mix of Covey, Carnegie, and the King James Bible, Dan Miller provides some spiritually-inspired guidance for the misplaced or temporary worker looking for a new direction. From searching one's self, to negotiating the employment landscape, to sealing the deal with your new employer, this book provides a handy, single-volume source of inspiring quotes, useful tidbits, and practical advice.The problem is that in the oh so humbling job market of recent years, this book's Pollyannaish outlook is out of place. While perfectly appropriate for the time it was written, the book could use a refresh of realism. Fortunately, an update (see48 Days to the Work You Love: Preparing for the New Normal) is apparently on the way, and while I can't speak for whether it has hit the mark, I do suggest modern day job seekers begin or continue their journey there rather than attempting to navigate with this relic of a distant, high employment age."
5,Horse Art book,"This was the last of my horse books to arrive , understandably , it is a huge picture book. It has some great pictures and interesting history.It was originally $75.00 I was very pleased to get such a great buy!Used is fine with me!"
3,Retro Amber Pin,I rated this pin as not worth the money and that it looked cheaper than advertised. The Advertisement still states that there are no reviews. What is the use of giving feedback if it is not put out there for all to see? I am disapointed with the product more now than ever. I had waited too long to return it which is my fault but others should know so that they do not make the same mistake.
4,Just what I wanted!,"Although a college textbook designed for non-majors, ""Invitation to Oceanography"" contains much information for those interested in the subject. What I especially liked and appreciated the most were the application tasks. These are mathematical problems/questions one can use and apply to the ocean on their next trip to the beach. Moreover, the Internet links provided in the book add a great supplement. Educators at the secondary (high school or college) level will enjoy teaching from this book."
4,Great Applications Towards Oceanography,"""Invitation to Oceanography"" provides a wealth of information as a non-fiction text. For those interested in the complexities of the inner-workings of oceanic events and marine biology, this is the book to read. The book is a fascinating read delving into facts and figures of oceanic characteristics and definitions. Teachers and/or those interested in marine science will find the book intriguing with its application towards the field of mathematics, marine science, and chemistry. It will forever change how you perceive the ocean on your next beach vacation."
1,written all over,this is a lab book that I trusted would have nothing written in or maybe just a little bit. Most of the labs in the book were written in and there are pages ripped out. Unfair purchase because I have to do the labs and hand them in.
2,Risky Departure?,"I did not like this album and I have a fan for a long time. I believe that Ms. Mattea's voice does not have the verve and quality of just a few years ago. It is a departure, in more ways than one."
2,Good Information Poorly Presented,"I think Capt. Rains has done a wonderful job with their cruising guides. However, this particular book should be passed on because their other guides (Mexico & Central America) are far superior and contain very nice graphics. This blue cover book is mostly text and lacks the intuitive feel as the other guides. I suggest that Capt. Rains withdraws this book in favor of her professionally created guides, which I highly recommend."
5,A complet quilt,"Lynn Nicholas's ""Cruel World"" has tied together so carefully,and in such a scholarly way, all of the threads...the complete facts, the stories, the horrors of the millions of people from so many countries who suffered and were killed by the Nazis...into a complete quilt that will, hopefully, be required reading in all of our schools and colleges. This is a must read."
2,"God, she looks unhappy","The transfer is good and everything technical about the DVD was fine - Something Weird usually does a good job and I have lots of their other titles (both on DVD and tape). But this movie is just awful. Chesty Morgan (billed as Zsa Zsa) looks so miserable during the movie it is painful to watch. Obviously nobody expects brilliant direction or camera work from a Wishman film, but her habit of focusing on something inane like a lamp while two people are talking gets irritating after a while, even if youre watching it because its bad. Bad Girls Go to Hell is slightly less awful if I had to choose. If youve never seen a Wishman film, rent one before plunking down 20 odd bucks for a DVD."
1,Please back away from this photoshop book,"I will keep it short. The book lacks a basic foundation for photoshop or any other image editing software. The information in this book is the equivalent of jacking around with photoshop for two hours. The only benefit that can be derived from this book is that it shows what about 12 of the filters do, However, The Photoshop Handbook breaks down every single filter, brush and effect and it only costs about four dollars..."
3,"Okay, not great","I purchased this item for my linen closet. I have a lot of small toiletry bottles that kept tipping over on the wire shelves that were installed. While it does it job, for the most part, I am not thrilled with the product. It still curls up/doesn't lay flat, unless something heavy is lying on the edges to hold it down. It comes with little tie-downs, but they really don't work. For the money, I would not recommend. I bet a standard drawer liner would be just as good and not curl and cheaper."
1,A BUNCH OF HOOEY?,"Ladies and gentlemen: I'm sure The Kissers are a good LIVE band, but, hmmmm... does anyone else find it a little fishy that prior to mine there were only FOUR reviews? The syntax seems just a little too similar, as do the raves and comments. The reviews occur within a couple months of one another (perhaps during a Kissers TOUR, hmmmm?) And ALL FOUR REVIEWERS HAVE REVIEWED ONLY ONLY ONLY THIS CD - NOTHING ELSE - ON AMAZON?I'm sure it's all in good fun and a big joke, but it's also dishonest. Ha, ha back at ya... look what my rating of 1 just did to your average.Sorry folks... I ain't buyin' it... literally..."
5,roger is the BEST!,"I LOVE THIS CD! Every song is awesome! His voice is unbelieveable! He was SUPERTRAMP! Just last year, I got the chance to play the drums with him on stage in Portland! What a SHOW! This cd always makes my day!"
3,Not his best work,"Hai Hai was a step back in the solo career of Roger Hodgson. The songs' compositions are not brilliant, only good. The only remarkable song for my taste is 'London', despite the unusual production in 'Hai Hai'. Recently I was lucky to be at his magnificent concert, and he played songs of the Supertramp era and of his solo career, but he did not played none of the songs on this album. This fact is clearly meaningful.If you want to hear his real masterpiece in his solo career, take 'In the eye of the storm'.'Open the door' is another great work (four stars) plenty enjoyable."
4,I love this book!,"I find this tattingbook very interesting. The book is originally from 1967 and it has many nice patterns, specially I like the doilies. It has patterns for beginners and for more advanced tatters. The pictures is to great help for me since I havn't tatted for very long time, to be excact only for 2 months,and I learned to tat from a website. Still I found the patterns easy to follow except for one and thats ""Water Lily"". But I will not give up and I'm sure that one sunny day I will manage to do that lovely doily. It's the centre that gives me problems, the rest seem to be very easy. I even went to library to have a look at the book in its origin language, swedish, but it's still too difficult for me,yet..This book is really a ""must"" for serious tatters!!"
2,Not much to go on,"The instructions include the basic knot, how to join rings, how to join threads. That's it. Nothing on making chains, hints on when to reverse work, how to use two shuttles, what is ""one shuttle, second thread"" etc. You do need these techniques to make most of the patterns though. So I would say the book is incomplete. To top it off, the patterns are not all that inspiring."
5,Love this album!,"This album was wonderful when it was first released, and it's still wonderful today! Love me some Shirley Bassey, remixed or not! My favorites are Goldfinger and Big Spender. Great for parties and dancing."
4,"If You Like Shirley, You WIll Surely Like This","Her old tunes, with new dance-able backbeats.Great party/club/dance music.My SO is a huge fan of hers. I am less so, but the new versions of the songs are easier on my ears and more fun to listen to in the background."
4,Conceptually brilliant,"The highs of this album are Himalayan: Goldfinger, Never Never Never, Big Spender, and the opener, Where Do I Begin? That said, neither ""Light My Fire"" ignites much of a spark. But that's the risk with this kind of an effort, and I'm willing to tolerate a dud or two. Definitely worth the price of admission."
3,"Use that ""skip track"" button wisely","I love the ""Light My Fire"" and ""Diamonds are Forever"" mixes on this album. Luckily, you can play them over and over and they never seem to bore. Good thing, too, as you won't listen to ""Easy Thing to Do,"" ""Never, Never, Never"" or ""If You Go Away"" beyond the original listenings.And as for ""Moonraker""...well, it didn't work then, and it doesn't work now. That's more than offset though by ""Goldfinger,"" still the reigning gold standard for the mostly lame Bond theme songs that followed. [Anyone remember ""View to a Kill"" by Duran Duran?]"
3,Interesting... but not essential.,"Whilst walking with my kid through the Virgin megastore I stopped at the listening booth and checked out this CD. A few tracks were enough to get me to buy it. Some are very good - (""Big Spender"", ""Light My Fire"" (Kenny Dope remix), ""Spinning Wheel"") that retain the original heart and soul yet go all out with a unique and refreshing facelift.A few are just plain awful -- ""If You Go Away"" (DJ Skymoo Aka Moloko Remix) has buried the beauty of the orignal tune under meaningless techno beats that may pass muster on the dancefloor but makes for an incredibly boring song for anyone else. The remaining two ""Light My Fire's"" (Dj Spinna Remix and Twelf Tree Remix respectively) do similar."
2,No Dancing Here,"I guess I'm going to swim against the tide on this one. I would give a 4 or 5 to virtually every other Santana album (maybe with the exception of a 3 on Oneness). As a guitarist, Santana is one of my idols. However, this album is just plain boring from my perspective. I see no spark of the brilliance I have come to expect from Carlos nor inspired playing from anyone in the band."
4,the spirits are dancing in the heavens above,"Santana continues to thrill me time and time again.Truely one of his best works, tapping all that is rock and just a furious beating of latin and jazz funk for the sences. This one you will want to hear over and over again!"
2,Worst Carlos Solo Effort,"This is the worst Carlos Santana sol effort. THe songs sound lame and are kinda poppy. I wouldn't recomend this album to fans of early Santana. Only three songs keep this album from getting one star. (Jingo-Lo-Ba, Spirits Dancing In The Flesh, and Third Stone From The Sun)"
4,Me gusto mucho...,"Another great,underrated and almost forgotten Santana album,'Spirits'is in no way below the quality of'Supernatural';it features the same expansiveness,taste,and primordial power of that and every Santana album.In fact Carlos is the one who said that'Prince is funkier than Mozart'."
3,An overlooked piece of the marriage puzzle,"This film highlights a clear picture of traditional marriage roles reversed. He plays a codependent ""supermom"" while she a self absorbed and absent husband. His codependency puts up with the affair hence the appearance of his humourously played alter ego. When he finally speaks up and asks for a confession, the alter ego did his job and hops on a bus, but persumably only for the time being (cavity filled) since nothing is shown that his wife will not simply just have another affair down the road nor does it seem likely that he's ready to face up to the connection between mind and body. He will forgive her and be glad to have her back but their hygiene habits (core maritial problems) remain."
2,You should read the novella instead!,"This boring, rambling movie (with two of my favorite actors, Campbell and Davis) was a waste of my time. I loved Smiley's novella, ""The Age of Grief"" but this movie had an entirely different flavor and feeling.I thought that the characters were one-dimensional and were never developed enough for me to care about them or what happened to them. What was the point/plot? Oh, yeah....a guy afraid to confront the problems in his marriage....And I found the Dennis Leary character to be distracting and ridiculous.I was tired of the couple about 20 minutes into the movie, and it never got any better for me."
1,Terrible film. Not recommened at all.,This 2002 film is about a married couple who are both dentists. The marriage is troubled. The children are a handful. It is all very boring. This film is part reality and part fantasy with a disgruntled patient becoming the male dentist's alta ego. Sound awful? Well it is. I watched this film for about 40 minutes before shutting it off. I should have not bothered in the first place.
3,Sound statement of basics,A sound and simple basic text on the tactical basics of getting change accepted and implemented. It is written within the framework of a traditional hierarchical organization and appears to be pitched at first line management within such organizations.
3,Good study tool,"This study Bible is ok. There's not as much information in it as I had hoped, but it's ok. I don't regret buying it."
5,Cute as a Bunny,"This fleece bunny is so adorable and my dog, a little Havanese named Lucy, loves it. She cuddles with it, plays fetch with it and has a good, old-fashioned tug of war with it. It has held up amazingly well thru all this and I haven't had to do re-stitch surgery on it at all. I'm very pleased with this toy (and so is Lucy!)"
2,Not that sturdy,"We've had the rabbit less than 3 weeks and it is already coming apart at the seams. My beagle puppy (5 months) is very happy with it, but my wife has already had to repair the seams around the ears. While it is soft and the dog loves it, I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Not as bad as it seems.,"First things first, the drawings are very amateurish but they look better than sweet's cover. Sweet's cover may look ""professional"" but they are downright ugly and is a sacrilege to the series. These drawings at least look like they were done by a fan who tried. The book also includes quite a bit of background information that simply couldn't be inferred from the series. At the very least, you have to admit it put to rest a lot of wild speculation. All in all, this is a must have for the fans who simply have to know everything and for those who notice every little discrepancy, well, forget it."
2,Gods green Earth,"What on Gods green Earth would have R.J. approve of such horrible art work? I am not convinced in the least, that the artist/s even read the WoT series. To qualify myself, I am an avid fan of RJ's work and have read the entire series 4 times now, I am sure I now know what the characters are supposed to look like. Within the covers of this illustrated guide, is perhaps the worst depiction of character resemblance I have ever SEEN!!! It turns my stomach. As an example, Lanfear is described in the series repeatedly as possibly one of the most beautiful women ever... In the Guide, she looks like a pigs behind!! Due to the poor quality of the art, I find it very difficult to even read the contents. I guess I will just have to keep waiting for Path of Daggers!! If you want to see excellant drawings based on the the Wheel of Time series, I suggest checking out the work of Richard Boye and/or Dragonluv on the web... at least they read the series. -Kinslayer"
2,Not the Greatest,"I must say I would have been fine waiting a little longer for the 8th book rather than having to get this as a Wheel of Time fix. I have always been a bit disappointed by the illustrations on the covers of the books, but the illustrations in this book are just not enjoyable. I was consistently disappointed by the writing. Though there was info I was happy to read about, the writing style left a lot to be desired. i just gave up and haven't finished reading it, it's not worth anymore time to me. I dearly love this group of characters, but I can't finish this book. Sorry."
1,WOT - Waste of Time,"I do not think that I have ever had my expectations so high only to have them crushed this badly. I consider everything about the first 7 wheel of time books to be nothing less than excellent. Then I finally see this new WOT book on the shelf.......I was really excited...........until I opened it up. I flipped through it - thank god - before buying it. Of course, just like most people in the review previously stated, I put it back. It was HORRIBLE! I expected to see some of the really beautiful women that are described in RJ's books. But the only thing that I found was a bunch of lizards........that is really the only way that I can describe them. Not to mention most small children have better spelling and punctuation. Book 8 better be good and on the shelves soon!"
3,A little bit dissapointing...,"This book is quite nice, but I had higher expectations... There are few new facts. The artwork is really bad :(, Jordan should have asked Larry Elmore (Dragonlance Artwork) for the pictures..."
1,concerned reader,Thanks for the warning abou the book guys. What I would like to know is why the hell R.J. is goofing aroud with anything but the sequels to the W.O.T.
2,"Interesting, but unsatisfying.","This book, which reads like a stalling tactic on the part of Mr. Jordan's publishers, is too meager in fresh insights to warrant its' hefty price or even its' existence. The illustrations are largely unimaginative, and much of the contained information has been presented in much more effective settings. Despite this, a fan of the author does not come away wholly unsatisfied. Some of the details of the Age of Legends are juicy, especially the descriptions of the Forsaken. Unfortunately, the rest would already be familiar to anyone who would be remotely interested in this book. As a casual fan I hoped for a lot more from this volume."
2,The artwork frightened me.,"Okay...When I first heard that this 'illustrated guide' was coming out, I got excited. Yet another way for me to satisfy my Jordan obsession. I eagerly stood by bookstores as they hauled in those pristine white editions (some bound in plastic!) and shivered as finally were set down on the shelves, waiting to be sold.Then I opened the book.Okay, I'm being a little hard on the artist. I understand that it is a little difficult to meet some of the grand expectations that WOT fans have. And I do admit that many of the background sketches/paintings were really nice. However, many of the character sketches were indeed 'amateurish' (as some other reviewer had noted). It is disturbing when you see your favorite character looking like some kind of horse or ogre (especially if your fav chars are not Bela or Loial). In short, if more care was given in selecting an artist, the WoT Illustrated Guide would be greatly improved."
2,perfect for the younger readers,"I found this book incredibly helpful, considering I need all the help I can get reading Jordan's works. I'm one of his younger readers and I find it difficult to grasp some things. This book is great except for the artwork, which leaves something to be desired."
1,Not worth the price,"I bought this years ago thinking it would provide great artwork and insights into the the Wheel of Time series. Sadly, it gave neither decent artwork nor anything other than information already available by simply reading the novels. A disappointment in every respect."
2,Not overly usefull and could spoil things for new readers,"While I truly enjoy the WoT books, I have to say this was a ""Show me the money"" book by TOR. The information in the book was primarlily a rehash of things readers discover or can infer through reading the series. In other words, for those that have read the complete series up to the date of this book there was not a whole lot of new information. For those that are just starting the WoT series, this book could spoil a lot of the suprises. I also have to admit that I thought the art was terrible and question wheter the artist even read the series.On the plus side, the Guide provides a handy reference for hard core WoT fans. It also provides a number of maps that the books have lacked.I would suggest buying this only after you have completed reading the series up to book 8 and have read the short story in ""Legends."" This is a good reference book to have if your re-reading the series or just trying to pass the time until the next book is out."
5,Great Book for all hard core Wheel of Time fans,"This is a great book for all of the hard core fans of the Wheel of Time series. I bought it several years ago, and it has tons of useful WOT information."
4,Great Gift Idea,"For anyone who follows the Wheel Of Time series by Robert Jordan, this illustrated Almanac of that world that he has created is a necessary adjunct for the collector. Beautifully illustrated, detailed character anecdotes, all combine to make this a worthy purchase."
5,A must have!,5 star plus! This is is a great gift or a great addition to the library. An absolute must have for that Jordan fan.
3,"Not all that bad, but way below expectations.","I suppose this book is not all that bad, but as I am a WOT lover(finsished reading the 7 books for the 2nd time) I cannot but compare and expect nothing less superb than the WOT itself. Stop throwing us crums and let us dive into the cake....BOOK 8!"
3,"Please, Its just a helpful guide.","Yes, It does have some down sides, but art work and typos aren't everything. The info was useful and it did not in anyway ruin any of the mysteries of the series for me."
2,Someone Needs a New Pair of Glasses,"That about sums up what I saw in this unimpressive text. I had just finished Crown of Swords and was happily suprised to see this on the shelves (although I would have preferred the next installment) but a quick perusal told all I needed to know. Someone needs a new pair of glasses. Although I am sure the artist meant well, I believe that she must be a really good friend of Mr. Jordan's, for only friendship could explain how a man able to paint such brilliant illustrations in the reader's mind with the written word could fail to see the pedantic and amatuerish art displayed within. Next time, lay aside the friendships and choose a peer of equal stature. A lack of illustrations would have been better."
3,Flawed editing and artwork weaken WoT,"While I concur with much that has been said about this guide, especially the typos and the god-awful artwork (what did she do, save Jordan's kids' lives?), there were parts of it I found fascinating, especially those referring to the Forsaken and the Age of Legends, especially since Jordan has stated it very unlikely he will do a work based on that period. I would recommend this book to the collector who must have all the books in hardcover, but I would ask for it as a gift, as it isn't near worth the asking price. I get the feeling that (being familiar with this business) that it is likely that TOR insisted on this work and may have badgered Jordan into doing it. I hope the poor editing and some content is due to Jordan committing more time to Vol. 8 of his series, which is where his attention should be. Don't lose faith Jordan fans!"
3,"not bad, mmmmmmm but maybe not good?","The book does have some typos and discrepencies with the series, but keep in mind that this book was probably(?) rushed. It was not completely written by Jordan either. And the info in the book has supposedly been passed down from generation 2 generation. The guide was written by the 'omnipotent' one. I am still waiting for the Path of Daggers, god-speed to the pen of Robert Jordan"
1,"Thanks for the warning, guys.","I am a rabid Wheel of Time fan. I've never been disappointed yet. The longer the book the better - but this stinks. The reviews here saved me mucho deniero. Forewarned, I visited a nearby bookstore and boy were you right! As for the art: *retching noises* Major characters are missing, like Min. I, and I think other fans, would have willingly paid $100 for beautiful art and interesting writing on the history of Rand-land. But the publishers loaded it with crap, for the discount price of $40.00."
1,UGH!!!,"I don't understand why a series of this calibur has artwork this crappy. If I were the author of a hit series I'd want the best possible drawings representing my book possible, wouldn't you? Must hang my head in shame for old Rob....could have done better...much, much better."
1,Welcome to the land of disappointment,"Luckily, I didn't actually buy this book; I borrowed it from a friend. The art left so much to be desired and the typos and inaccurate portraits were horrible. Robert Jordan has created a fantastic world and left incompetent work to mar his masterpiece."
2,Pretty Bad Use of Your Money,"Let's Make this Quick. 1. Interesting information about the world that Jordan has created, but I personally think it is more fun to find out these things from the books themselves. 2. Terrible art. Bad bad bad bad. This really ruined this book for me. I could't stand how the artist portrayed almost every character and everything else he drew.That about sums it up."
2,two words describe this book....,"Cut and Paste...actually, i give it one and a half stars...this book is just a re-iteration of the history behind the wheel of time taken from the books. i could swear that robert jordan also uses the same exact words (undoubtedly cutting and pasting from his laptop). there is some useful information about the forsaken and the age of legends but i felt the book was pretty general in everything and almost no new information was given. the font was also huge and the margins were pretty wide. it was done purposely, of course but i felt cheated...i for one enjoyed the illustrations...they weren't very detailed because i believe the artist used water colors but they were aestheically pleasing, nonetheless. good to have for the collection but not necessary for enlightenment...check the net for good insights."
2,Severely Dissapointed!!!,"I am twelve years old and an avid reader of Robert Jordan's WOT series, but I have to say that I was VERY dissapointed when I waisted 40 bucks on this so-called encyclopedia for the WOT. There were numerous typos, and only little tidbits added on to what most WOT fans already know. And some of those pictures scare me! Lan was startling, to be polite, and when I saw that picture of Loial I almost screamed in horror! I thought that the person who was illustrating would have the characters at least SOMETHING like what I imagined. Guess not! When I first saw this book, I thought it was going to be great because of the very good summary of The Age of Legends, but then when I bought the book I saw that there was hardly anything that I didn't know already. This book is only good for people who haven't read The Eye of the World. I NEVER say anything bad about RJ's books, but this one really let down my expectations."
3,The art burns my eyes but the text is OK,in many circles this book is refered to as the Big Book of Bad Art (BBoBA)If I rated this book soley on the art it would get a 1 but for a fan of the series who wants to be able to look somthing up quickly its a great resource I used to play the RPG and this book was a lifsaver. even if it is outdated now I would love to see a new version of the book that would include some of the new stuff seen but I am more than satisfied with this book I would however suggest you try and grab one used if you want one as its not great.
3,Was it really worth it?,"I am an elementary school student. I had to wheedle SO MUCH to get my folks to buy this for my B-day. Now I wonder if it was worth it. All the extra info is cool, but the illustrations SUCK! I think we all agree on that. The people do NOT look like that! Rand and Mat are cuter, and Lanfear is so pretty you can't put her on paper, and so on."
4,Great Information,"This book is very good at describing the distant past of Randland. I really enjoyed the part about the AoL. The artwork was dissapointing, though. Perrin looked like an alien, and Lan just looked downright scary! If you really wish you knew more about the WoT series, you should really check this book out - it's very helpful. There are lots of nice maps and discriptions of far-off places that are very good."
3,$40. Come on.,"I tend to agree with what a number of people have been saying about this book. Most of the artwork is, quite frankly, terrible. Don't get me wrong as a reference book I've found it almost invaluble, but that's not the reason I wanted it. I had heard that the artwork was to be fantastic, and I was excited to see what I'd heard were going to be wonderful renderings of a fascinating world. I didn't get that. It's good, but not what I'd hoped for."
1,Horrible artwork ruins what could have been great,"The artwork is, unfortunately, on par with the covers of the series. I never understood why Jordan and TOR couldn't get better art for the covers. And then when this book came out I was so incredibly disappointed to see the paintings and such were basically as bad as the covers of the series. No, they are actually worse. Nothing takes you out of a fantasy world more quickly when it looks fake or, frankly, just bad.Hopefully those overseeing the Wheel of Time series after Jordan's death can get some better artists involved.For instance, the art work in George R.R. Martin's Art of A Song of Ice and Fire book is a great example of the quality of art that Jordan's series deserves."
3,"Content useful, art is appallingly bad","I found this to be a nice read to immerse myself in the wheel of time world without picking up the entire series again. However, the art makes me throw up in my mouth a bit. After seeing some very excellent fan art, I am sad that the publisher decided to use the artist they did. I can tell that they spent maybe 3 minutes on a large number of the illustrations. Maybe they wanted it to lend to the idea of a historian making their own art to go along with their passages...probably not though.When you have a series this big, you should reach out and get someone who is willing to at least give the rich world Robert Jordan created some visual depth. I would love to see this re-released after the final book is published, as a more comprehensive and complete guide to the wheel of time."
3,So-so,"This book contains an enormous amount of information about the world Robert Jordan created. The detail about the Age of Legends, the Forsaken, Shadowspawn, Aes Sedai, and other nations is great for diehard fans of the series.The only problem with the content is that it doesn't include the later books. The cover art contained stops atA Crown of Swords (The Wheel of Time, Book 7), but it was published afterThe Path of Daggers (The Wheel of Time, Book 8), so I'm not sure how much of the series it covers. Obviously it would have been more helpful if it had been written after the final book.The art inside can only be described as horrendous. I was hoping for some good illustrations of the characters I've been reading about, but the book covers are far better. The illustrations look like they were done by a child, most of the characters look the same."
4,"Bought for a friend, hates the art.",I bought this book for my friend but I have to say the pictures SUCK. I mean let the author at least see the pictures ( they probley did not). The best art was borrowed form the books themselves. This has good info but the art work is poor. The worst is the people. If you really want this book drop a hint to someone about it for a gift.
4,A must for the Wheel of Time fans,"The World Of Robert Jordan is a great book detailing the history and peoples of ""Randland"" From the Age of Legends to Artur Hawkwing a must for any fan of the Wheel of time. The Book seems to be written from the time of the books, without getting too involved with Characters, but does hint at them. The only drawback is the portraits, which seem to fall short of the characters, but that's to be expected in such a fantasy epic. A great compainon to the Wheel of Time."
4,Full of interesting information.,"When i bought this book, it took me awhile to get into it, but once i started reading it more frequently, i wasnt dissapointed. It goes into great detail explaining anything and everything that you could think of in the Wheel of Time universe. I definately recommend this book if you are a fan of Robert Jordan's extremely popular books. It tells you the past of all the forsaken, and goes into great detail about all of the major and minor lords/ladies and lands in which they control. Definately a must for any WoT fan!"
5,"""The World of Robert Jordan's the Wheel of Time""","A great book. Gives all the information you could want out of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. History, timelines, and important facts about all the nations that make up Jordan's fictional world. It even gives the calender and holidays of the many nations. Facts and info on the Aiel, the Seanchan, the Aes Sedai, and Sea Folk. Stories from before the Breaking, during the Breaking, and after. Nothing--save the books in the Wheel of Time series--beats this book."
2,The artwork absolutely ruins this book,"I can't believe I bought this book. The artwork is SO bad, that I can't even open the book just to read it. Did they hire a 3-year-old to do the art? What was Robert Jordan thinking???I've seen better looking artwork at the bottom of a toilet bowl!This review was only meant to cover the pictures in the book and not the written word...If you could get over the bad art, and you're a huge Jordan fan, you might like this book."
1,Big Book of Bad Art,"This is known by fans as the big book of bad art for a reason. Its a big book and its full of bad art. A few snippets about the world that won't really influence events is ok, but the drawings are not accurate, and not well done. There's fan art out there that is a lot, lot LOT better than this, free for viewing."
4,"Great reference, but artwork...","The info in this book is great! Details on the Age of Legends, Artur Hawking, Shara, Seancean, and the Sea Folk, among other things. One complaint: the artist's rendering of the characters portraits is horrible. For instance, they made Elayne a brunnette when she is actually blonde. Also, They all look basically the same. It makes me question whther the artist really read the book. But besides that, this is a great reference to those interested in the background of the WoT."
3,"Book? Good, Art work? not so good","Well I liked the book. It told you a lot about the history of all the different classes of people and told a lot about the world itself. That I really enjoyed. Now about this art work. All I have to say is that most of the characters in this book that were drawn looked nothing like how I pictured them to be. I was saying to myself, is this how Jordan had those characters pictured? Well, I'll leave it to him to get a better artist. but it is a good book nonetheless and if you are a big fan of WoT like me, you might as well add it to ur collection."
2,"Good info, not good art","There is a lot of original information here, on the mysterious land of Shara, for instance. If you like the complexity of the Wheel of Time series, you will like seeing the summarized information from the series too. The art work does not capture the personality of the characters, and sometimes it does not even reveal what sex they are very clearly. The characters described as most beautiful or handsome come off looking no better than those described as looking average. The faces have no expressions, so that there is little to distinguish one drawing from another. The maps are informative, and they are much better than trying to draw them out for yourself using hints from the series. Only for a die-hard Robert Jordan fan."
2,Full of information and lacking in good artwork.,"While I found the Compendium a useful resource for WoT fans, I found it to be pricey and the artwork was pitiful. For the price, TOR could have hired a decent artist."
2,Dissapointingly low quality,"I have read all of the books currently avaliable in the Wheel of Time and, although - sometimes - Jordan's writing is not brilliant, it is a whole lot better than this. The style of writing adopted for the book is rather simple, as if the people who were to read it would not have already read most of the series (unlikely, I think). The information about the Age of Legends was new and interesting, but almost everything after was just taken striaght from the books, with no new insights added. The artwork was of fairly naff quality, and apparently the aritist did not bother to read the books: Verin's hair is supposed to have grey streaks, amongst other things. All in all, this was of a very poor quality and - since they'll probably write another one at the end of the series - I'm extremly pleased I made my Dad pay for it!"
3,Unknown facts.,"In general I liked the content of this book. Some things of interest I heard at a con: The typos did not exist in the original manuscript. They are mostly the work of bad copy-editing. Apparently R J did not have time to re-check the galleys (proofs). Also, there were originaly at least 5 short stories written for this book, including the one on line at TOR. They were all cut to keep the price down. The artist also claims to have done the drawings while sitting in R J's living room so they could be approved. I think something must have happened in the translation or in the color finishing to make them so bad after all that."
2,Read through it first. Do not buy it first.,"This book is extremely disappointing, in a word. I'm a loyal (and somewhat obsessed) reader of the Wheel of Time series, and I pre-ordered this book as it looked really good. When I got it...well. While the information contained in the book is a good reference for someone as obsessed as myself, the artwork really, really brings the book down. The characters look like they have some kind of deformity (Loial with his head smashed in, Lan having some sort of nose problem) and it's in a style I, personally, do not like. To its credit, the book has some interesting information on the Age of Legends, etc, but please, read this at a local bookshop and see if you can get past the artwork. If you can, then go ahead and buy it."
2,Are you taken by the Dragon?!,"I was honestly hoping for a source of information perhaps like that in Tolkien's The Silmarillian, and the accompanying encyclopedia. There was not art but a map of the old Earth, but it wasn't needed. Without spoiling the atmosphere, it perfectly added to the mythos of the Lord of the Rings. Instead I flipped it open to be horrified by the ""portraits"" within. Verin is ageless only due to the lack of detail, and Aviendha...? Reminds me of the lizard she spitted to show Rand. The sheer number of contradictions and typos is a quick turn-off, especially contradictory pieces within the book! Now that I've suitably bashed it, I ought to bring up the guide's good points. There is quite a bit of new information relating to Shara, Seanchan, the AoL, and the Forsaken. Overall, this book probably makes par... Par, however, won't win world championships any time soon."
4,Good!,"I don't know about you guys but I enjoyed it. Yeah, the pictures aren't Michael Whelan or Keith Parkinson quality but I think what they do lack, you make up in your imagination. I would rather see a sketch of a character I have fully imagined in my head versus seeing a complete rendition of a character that I have imagined to be something else comepletly. The sketch kind of makes you...Fill in the spaces. These pictures were obviously sketches, lol. Anyways, the rest of it is interesting and if you don't want to look up a bunch of info on the books in the books, look in here!"
1,A great disappointment,"I am a fan of Jordans, the Wheel of Time series is a rollicking good read. This is not. Fortunately I decided to look through it, before parting with my hard-earned.My overall impression is of a pot-boiler, cobbled together in a hurry, to cash in while we readers drum our figurative fingers, waiting for the next book from Jordan's busy pen.The text is sketchy, the graphics are decidedly amateurish, and the content is slim.My considered opinion is that this is a fanzine with pretensions of being a coffee table ornament.Don't buy it, borrow somebody else's."
4,Perhaps some light on the subject?,"I think that perhaps the apparent slipshod construction of this ""guidebook to the WOT"" is somewhat misleading. From What I understand, Mr. Jordan had over a 1000 pages of notes. I would imagine that it may be rather difficult after 10 years to keep it all straight. I think that maybe he had some help trying to compile the notes, and then published them. It was probably just as much for his benefit as ours. Whether or not it is tightly knit narrative, or loosely bound claptrap due to some spelling errors, typos, etc.; it should really serve if nothing else as a good mnemomic for readers of the series, and perhaps for Mr. Jordan himself. So take it with a grain of salt and enjoy it for the fact that it means that he hasn't forgotten about his readers."
3,Quick and rushed....,"This was a book I was very much looking forward to. I heard a lot about it and couldn't wait to get a complete book on my faviorite fantasy series. I was mostly excited about the pictures which I imagined as being grand as they are in Tolkiens Illustrated books. I was greatly, and I mean GREATLY DISSAPOINTED by the unimaginative quality of the drawings. Main characters were given extremely small ""face"" drawings. They also all looked the same!! In fact every drawing in the book was cheaply drawn and disapointing. I hope Jordan would give the same richness to these books as he does to his novels....by the way, what's up with the billion year wait between books?"
5,A must read for Jordan fans!,"The companion book to the he wheel of time is a great help for a readers of WOT. No, it won't help you figure out the aiel clans and septs (what could?) but it will give you a great idea of life before and after the breaking, and all the wars. It is a good resource guide should you ever get lost. Yes, the drawings are bad (Verin does _not_ look like a mouse!), but there are also some illustrations that can help. I would tell any true WOT addicts to read this book and fast!"
2,Ultimately disappointing...,"Having read all of the Wheel of Time books (so far) I,like any other fan, love to imagine the world of the books in my head and I was very excited when I heard this book existed. Alas, it wasn't what I hoped it would be. Although it was imaginative and it clarified many of the points in the books in the end it just felt like the authors were writing this book with one hand tied behind their backs. They had no idea how the series was going to turn out so they had to write a very limited view of Randworld. In my opinion they should've waited until the end of the series to write this book. And yes, my god, they should've gotten a better artist. The drawings look like they were done by seven year olds. The faces are ugly, the bodies are out of proportion and the colors are dull and lifeless. Is it so hard to find good artists? Get Barlowe. Then we would have a guide worth buying."
5,good supplemental material,"this is a good supplemental to have with the books. in the 9000 pages or so of reading we've all done so far, it's hard to get the history of his world down, so it's nice to see it more organized and not scattered through the current story. i just hope we get more immersed in the shara and seanchan worlds. that would be fun. it would be a waste if we don't actually see those two worlds, if all the action happens only in the current land."
3,Not impresive,"I am a big fan of the WoT books. I've always been a little disappointed with the artwork the publisher produced. I was not impressed with this book's artwork either. The information within does not do much to enhance the experience for WoT readers. Even though I was disappointed, I will not tell all Wheel of Time fans to stay away. It depends on your expectations. If you love the books and want to buy up everything related to them, this will enhance your collection. The book is professional and accurate to the series. If you have not read all the books you should be aware that there could be some spoilers.This books defines a 3 star review- competent, but not impressive.To this day the best WoT art has been the fan art and the recent eBook covers."
3,close to advertised,"The book showed up quickly, but what not in quite as good of condition as advertised. Still, I am satisfied with the transaction and would recommend this seller to others. As for the book, I was expecting a lot more artwork, more of an illustrated guide to twot. This along with the fact the book was published in the 90's before a lot of the current books were written makes for an overall lacking guide to twot."
1,A waste of Time and Money,"I never thought I would say it, but this has ""Sell Out"" written all over it. I like many other Fools saw this book and bought it without hesitation. However, I will not make the same mistake again. Once I saw the so called picture of Loial, I calmly put the book down, hid it in the back of my bookshelf, and tried to pretend that I didn't waste almost 40 dollars on this garbage. I expect a masterpeice in book 8. And it had better offer some resolution that book 7 certainly did not offer."
5,The book really helped to explain the way their world works.,The book has great graphics and the explaination and past events help readers to better understand what has and will happen.
5,dont pass this one up!,"I have been looking forward 2 this book for 4 or so months and I fanaly got it today, and I love it. Some of the art work to this guide is less than impresive, but there are some good pictures. But this is NOT a picture book, and hey WoT was never ment to be. What this does have is VERRY good info, and a GREAT layout, that I really like. If you are a Robert Jordan fan get this, it is 40.00 but i think it is WELL worth it, i would love to awnser any questions at asmodean3@hotmail.com"
2,This may have been a good buy when it first came out . . .,"Widely reffered to on WoT (Wheel of Time) webpages, including ""official"" webpages, as the BBA (Book of Bad Art) this book (with the release of several more volumes of the WoT series) has become incredibly dated. It is nice to have some of this information in a readily indexed format, though.If you don't already have it, don't buy it unless you are a WoT fanatic, purchasing every WoT item that you can lay your hands on. Although, if you are a WoT fanatic, you probably already bought this book when it first came out, back when it was worth the price."
1,Ugly & overpriced,"Well, I saw it in a local bookshop an thought,wow, finally...but then this: Ugly drawings and a fat price tag. Even Manga-style images would do better. Did Robert Jordan ever see the drawings? I think not. Just forget it!"
5,Praise for bookseller,The book arrived much faster than I thought it would and it was in better shape than I had expected. Great bookshop. I am very pleased with my order.
2,STEVE IS AN IDIOT,"just thought u guys shhould know not to listen to steve sure this album sucks but their early work is not metallic at all, and this sounds nothing like GBH, this pop-ified hard rock punk stay away from this and GBH is not know for being pioneers of crossover, their stuff is early simple hardcore punk, he's an ass"
3,There are better text books,"I had to buy this textbook for my second film class, and maybe it was because I was welcomed into the film world with a lot of depth, but this textbook one certainly did not live up to my expectations. Film books themselves are supposed to be a work of art! Movies and Meaning was stripped of color (95% of it) and the explanations were not as in depth as others I've been exposed to. Color and the meaning of colors/tones/lighting is EXCEPTIONALLY important in film! How are you supposed to visually demonstrate lighting techniques, color saturation or desaturation, or tones without color?The only thing I did like is the few random pages in the middle of each chapter that they dedicated to a certain director.Overall, I think that if you're trying to learn the basics of film, there are better textbooks out there.My first recommendation: FILM: An Introduction; by Tom Wallis"
3,Textbook,"I only bought it as a textbook but it is okay, every key term is well explained and easy going"
2,Not A Good Choice,"First of all, if this book was about 75% cheaper, then maybe it would get 3 stars. But at its current price, it's really not worth it. Biggest problem is that the whole book is in BLACK AND WHITE! Except for a few specific pages. If you know anything about films then you'll understand why this is a problem. Also, they often don't even define the terms they use in the book. They just use them in a sentence and expect you to figure it out on your own. If I didn't need this book for class I'd return it. You can get way better books on film for a fraction of the price of this one. They do have some cool info on some movies, but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere."
1,What Happened to my Popcorn?,"I usually love smart pop popcorn , but they changed it and its awful. My mouth was greasy and I had to brush my teeth to get rid of it. It didn't smell like butter , it smelled like plastic and kinda tasted it like it too. I hope they change it back because I won't buy this popcorn again, nor will I reccomend it."
1,Extremely Salty--won't purchase online again,"We eat this all the time from the grocery store or from Costco. For some reason what we got from Amazon was so salty, no one in our home will touch it. So now we have 5 1/2 boxes of popcorn that no one will eat."
1,Extra Salty,"I meant to get the"" KettleCorn Smart Pop"", but I made a mistake.Instead of calling this ""Butter"", they should call it"" Extra Salty"".It's just way too much!"
4,Cool Grip,"The thumb-operated cassette transport and radio tuning joystick is great for runners. You can control all essential functions with just your thumb! The unit fits comfortably in your hand, and there is a music seek function that lets you skip ahead to the next song.There is also a unique ""beep"" feedback that sounds in the headphones whenever you choose to play, stop, FF, REW, etc. This audible feedback is useful to confirm that you chose the correct function and that the player is doing what you asked it to.One feature that could have been added is a stopwatch timer. Some of the other Sony models have this feature, but it seems to be absent on this model. The safety LED flashers are great for early-morning or late-night runners."
4,Manufacturing error?,"I loved this product... for about 2 months until the plastic around the handstrap broke ! I was actually stopped in the street by another girl with the same walkman who also had the same problem. The part that breaks is a very well shielded area right next to the belt hook. It appears to be an error in manufacturing as I took good care of my walkman, never dropped it and never treated it too harshly. Fortunately I am getting it repaired now but it is out of action for at least 3 weeks. Overall I found it to be a great model, ideal for running especailly with the thumb toggle which manipulates both tape and radio stations. This model however uses up more battery power than my previous walkman so beware. The hand strap is what makes this ideal for exercise unfortunately on mine - it broke."
4,Balloon Fun,"The whole package is great fun. A few of the balloons didn't work, but that is true for any balloon purchase. It was hard to figure out the car ones but once we did they were great fun. A great gift for kids over 8. Which, by the way, is a difficult age to buy for."
5,pat rocks!,"after almost 30 years of rocking, pat sounds better than ever singing all her classic hits!"
3,Not worth the money,This book is not worth the money. You can find most of the names listed free in internet sites..
1,Questionable,"In the book description, I have seen the prophet's name is taken without any respect. It should be noted that any Prophet's name should be taken with peace be upon him(PBUH). Let it be Jesus (peace be upon him) or prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him). If a book misses this then the book is of no use to us."
1,DVD-R Not worth it,This is a very interesting program but it is recorded on a DVD-R. The picture is only marginally better than the old VHS copy I had. Its just not worth 19.99 for a DVD-R as opposed to a newly made DVD.
3,Good,This is a good documentary about the Yanomami! Of course the recordings are a bit old so don't expect high definition images but you'll have a good idea of how these people live in the Amazon Forest and as for me it transported me to the times before C. Columbus arrived to the new world so it helped me imagine how my ancestors lived in our forests!
4,Good story of an Unusual hero,I truly enjoyed reading Slave of Chu Kutall. The choice for the main character gives the Fantasy Genre a fresh feel. Seeing the world from Nergal's eyes is a refresing change of pace. I've already shared this book with friends.
3,The wild west and proper british society come together,"I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. Having never heard of Brockway I didn't know what to expect, but she delivered with a witty novel that kept my attention the whole way through.The mystery is quickly figured out but that doesn't detract from the story. The characters are nicely done, though there are a couple of groan worthy moments during the sex scenes where the purple prose gets a bit out of hand.I like heroes who have believable flaws and Hart's was completely understandable. Mercy, his heroine, had a bit of the too-stupid-to-live syndrome but was a fun read nonetheless.I'll definitely be looking for Brockway's other titles in the future."
4,Renew your faith in humanity...read this book,"The first reviewer, Shari Just, has captured perfectly the quality, scope and value of Lear's biography. If you have ever wondered ""can one person make a difference"" this is the proof. A readable blend of history, place, people and events describing a modest scientist that loved to communicate scientific findings to a wider audience."
2,Graphis Great/ Mechanics to play poor,"If you have played Silent Hunter 3, then this game is poor compared to the ease of playing SS 3. The mechanics to get from station to station are cumbersome and downright difficult. The career option is the worst setup imaginable. Just to start a career mode and then save it and then find it again must have been designed by a beginner in the gaming field. On the plus side the graphics are very realistic and some added options make the scenes movie quality. To bad it is so difficult to get from station to station to play. One gets annoyed easily."
5,Fun Simulation,Very fun game to play with smooth game play and nice graphics. Can be relatively easy to play or quite challenging at high realism.
2,Hewlp!!,Ok first of all I went to download this game and install it but when I was installing it something popped up saying CATOSTROPHIC ERROR can someone please tell me how to install this game so I can play it otherwise im very unhappy right now.and im using a Netbook computer its not a regular Large computer.Hit me back ASAP!!
2,black screen,"I just recently downloaded this game SILENT HUNTER 4 WOLVES OF THE PACIFIC for amazon. After i install it , I wanna try it out, but no stupid black screen come up after intro and does work. I am very dissatisfied with this Game so far Because it wont work."
3,Great game but released unfinished!,"This will probably be a great game after it is properly patched. They have only released patch 1.2 as I write this and unfortunately, there are still major issues to be corrected. I am a huge fan of Silent Hunter III (that is a 5 star game, by the way).So, the game as it is now, is not great. If you buy it now, you will join me as an unwanted beta playtester for Ubisoft that should have waited and released the game when it was READY!If they continue releasing patches and fix all the issues, this will probably be a 5 star game at some point in the future.It is a real shame, really, I would like to have been writing a great review for this game..."
2,Skip this game,"Everything I have heard about this game is true - the good and bad. Right out of the box there was an immediate problem with Bugs. I have downloaded the patch, but there are still some serious gliches. Ubisoft is known for bugs, but they really out did themselves. It seems that they forgot to do any quality control testing. The game itself is fun - if you get past the low quality programming."
3,Campaign Mode game save buggy,"In campaign mode you do frequent saves so that you don't have to recreate a weeks work of building up your character and crew. Alas, the save routine seems to recreate your position by fast forwarding thru a movie of your entire game from the beginning. The longer your campaign then the longer the restoration time and the more inevitable the game restore process crashes. And if it doesn't will it crash the next time? Total buzz kill."
2,Didn't work.,"This is the second time, I tried this game. Second time, no luck. I don't know the story and I don't care. I would like to have had it work. I like these types of games, but what is not to be, is not to be."
2,No tutorial,I have not play a sub sim game since a game called 688I attack sub for sega genesis... After watching many videos on this game i decided to get this as a start off instead of going straight for Silent hunter 5. Needless to say i was very excited to download this game. And i even watched the video when it cam on. The i got into the menu and changed some things visually. So i was ready and clicked on the tutorial (sub school). This is not what a tutorial is about. If you wanted people to learn things on their own then this is definitely a tutorial for them. i would have rated this game higher had there been a tutorial but i have given up on learning how to play. good thing it was only 9.99.
1,Poor performance.,"I saw other reveiws of this game and all the red flags about its performance but I thought that by this time and downloading all the available patches it would work for me. But it was not to be.It runs so slowly that it is painful to even turn it on.I bought this because I was such a fan of the earlier versions of Silent Hunter especially the fisrt Pacific based game.So, a word to the wise that I did not heed. Mabe if my machince had more power it would be different."
3,Good Game,"Its what i expected out of the silent hunter team, but there are still a few bugs to fix, when you get it then i suggest you get the patches also, the graphics are decent, the real time play is great. I enjoy the game. if you liked Silent Hunter I and II then you will like this"
1,Does Not Work,I was looking forward to this game. Installed it exactly as instructed and it did not work. Had my computer Doctor look at it to determine if I installed wrong. Could not find any problems on my side. Did not return it as I have been out of the country and it is now too late.However... the company that sold it to me was excellent in their delivery date and the product was NEW.Bernard Sands
1,Silent Hunter: Wolves of the Pacific,"Not as good as SH-3. The interface is just to screwed up. I was hoping for a great follow up to SH-3, boy was this a let down. I still play SH-3. I gave this one away."
4,So much depth of play,"This game is remarkable not just for its realism, but also for its layers of playability. Not hung up on always getting the history right, it lets you play at a variety of levels--perfect for those days when you want a quick fix or when you're ready for a five-hour, full-immersion experience."
1,Nut much fun,"I played a similar games years ago called ""Silent Service"", ""Wolf Pack"", and ""Aces of the Deep"". Wanting to play immediately I downloaded the game. Halfway through the process the download stopped. Could not get the full download - would not install and it wasn't obvious how to get a refund. So - I purchased the CD version. Now after two weeks of waiting - Again, what a disappointment as it never ran on my system. Total bomb - will not do this again. I have it still if you would like to have it back!!!!"
3,Nice Sim,"Bought it when my PC was underpowered. Now I have a top notch rig, but cant find the media."
2,Boring,"Takes a VERY Long time to downlaod even with High Speed internet! No Tutorial, Very long learning curve, gets very monotimious after a short period. would Not Recommend"
1,Worst Software Ever,"It may be me, but I've tried loading this software on two seperate machines and it crashes every time I try to run it. Both machine have plenty of CPU power and 4GB of ram."
2,Bad news Submarine.,Extremely complicated and book is not alot of help.Not intuitive at all.This game is for hard core sophisticated users.
5,Excellent,Proper macrobiotic cooking unlike some other books which mix the pure foods with junk food. So many recipes...very thorough
2,Macrobiotic Cooking,Not at all what I expected. Not worth buying. Recipes not good for what I was looking for. Skip this one.
2,Macrobiotic cooking does not necessarily cure cancer,"I bought Aveline Kushi's ""Complete Guide to Macrobiotic Cooking"" after reading another book called ""Recalled by Life"" about a doctor who claimed to have been cured of cancer by following macrobiotics. This book does a good job of explaining macrobiotic cooking, but it is worth mentioning that author Aveline Kushi died in 2001 from cervical cancer which had spread to her bones. While I do believe that diet can help in the fight against cancer, macrobiotics is not and other forms of diet are not necessarily a cure all. I am sure it is a very healthy diet that works for many people, but it may be difficult to stick with. May Ms. Kushi rest in peace."
1,Not for all Jewish grandparents,"This book should have been subtitled ""the art of assimilated jewish grandparenting"" or ""how to keep your granchildren a little bit Jewish"". If you're looking for a book about that buy it. If you're looking for a nice book about how to grandparent a nuclear, jewishly oriented family, look elsewhere."
4,Cheaper in Canada,"Bought this 'for the boys from the club' to watch apres the match in my bar, and there are very few 'Girls and guns' DVD's around (note to war21 and girlsandguns, Put out a DVD !)only to find I could have got it $10 cheaper at Amazon.ca ."
4,Boobs and guns!,"I bought this because I love looking at Tylene Buck's tits in motion. My God, those are some lovely tits! They go up and down, spin around and round. I could look at those all day and not get bored. And the way they shake when she's firing a machine gun? I blew a giant hole in the crotch of my pants! Buy it!"
4,Heart Warming Movie,This movie is like a romantic comedy and I love it! I enjoyed this movie because it was funny and had a great story line. I love happy endings and this movie has one!
4,"a new ""family"" tradition","This is a very cute, funny movie and a perfect holiday flick to watch with the family (whether your biologically family or your chosen ones) by the fireplace. Adamo Ruggiero is magnificent, and of course the mom and dad's one liners are the best, especially with that Wisconsin accent. Very fun but also with a heartwarming message."
5,Very nice positive gay movie for a change..,"I rented this film and enjoyed it immensely, and was glad to see it become available on bluray, does not dissappoint."
3,Over the top,It's filled with stupid over the top clichés! Beyond stupid. My husband rented it. I'm thinking of divorcing him for his bad taste!
3,"Movie Five, Blu Ray quality Zero",This is is not a review of the movie but of the Blu Ray disc.I own over 200 Blu Ray discs and this is the single worst I have ever seen. The DVD is better image quality than this disc. I didn't know it was possible to take such a high quality format to such a low performance level.The movie has been grotesquely over corrected with noise reduction and edge enhancements. Portions of it look almost like a comic book due to lack of detail in darker areas. Didn't anybody actually watch this before approving its release? I would return it except that it is not the sellers fault that the studio released such poor quality.The sound quality is excellent.I really like this movie; I think it is one of Mr. Williams best. I was really looking forward to the Blu Ray but will now stick to the DVD for any future viewings.
5,So good...,This is an annual holiday watch for us. It is so very good. Having it on blu-ray is a real treat.
4,Better than expected!,"Clever, and funny, with a MUST-see ending.If you can excuse the actress playing the mother for doing an Edie McClurg imitation throughout--you know, Herb's wife on ""WKRP"", among many many other roles--you'll enjoy this one."
5,Blu-Ray Special Features,"This is not a review, but a list of the Special Features available on the Blu-Ray of ""Make The Yuletide Gay"" (since they aren't listed anywhere):* NEW audio commentary with writer/director Rob Williams and cast members Kelly Keaton and Derek Long* NEW video interview with writer/director Rob Williams* NEW video interview with actress Alison Arngrim* NEW video interview with original score composer Austin Wintory* NEW music videos by Jake Monaco and Jen Hansen - ""It's Christmas Time"" and ""Gloria""* NEW video message from actor Adamo Ruggiero* 1080p HD version of feature filmPlus all of the Special Features from the original DVD:* Audio commentary with writer/director Rob Williams and actors Keith Jordan and Adamo Ruggiero* Behind-the-scenes footage: ""Making The Yuletide Gay""* Cast interviews* Outtakes* Extended scenes"
5,Ordered without having see it!,After watching the DVD it has already become one of my new favorite movies. I ordered the soundtrack a few days later so that I could enjoy the songs from the film in my car.
5,Carrie,I LOVE this movie!!! It is one of those movies that you cant help but smile while you watch it.
4,"Very cute, great for Christmas.","It's a bit on the ""B"" side, but well-worth owning it. I've watched it at least three times. I didn't know any of the cast, but the lead is a hottie. The weak point is the dad, but other than that, good humor and a must-see."
1,A Waste of My Money,"I could barely get through this movie. The acting was bad, as if they just picked these people up off the streets and asked them to act in a cheap movie! The dialogue bored me. I lived in San Francisco for 16 years and even there gay men aren't everywhere you turn like in this movie. There's not always a gay man in the bathroom trying to pick you up and college campuses aren't full of happy gay guys with fake, cheap smiles! This film sucks! I want my money back!"
2,Gets on My Nerves!!,"I love the decorations in this movie. But the rest....absolutely nerve wracking! Especially the mother....that incessant giggle.......slap her!! And the two guys?? No CHEMISTRY at all! I was about ready to tear my hair out after a few minutes. Do not watch this film if high strung people get on your nerves.There is one good thing: Alison Arngrim (Little House on the Prairie's Nellie Oleson)steals the show as a sassy, sarcastic next door neighbor. The best line in the whole film is when the mother tells Alison's character...""Oh, don't be such a NELLIE""!!!Forget this one in most cases unless you want some good ideas about decorating for Christmas."
5,Good book for class,This book was required for my class. It was a very practical book for me. I got some good ideas for my ministry
2,N,"It didn't help that the plastic pouch attachment broke before I even got one shot off. Probably just a fluke, but I didn't bother trying them again.....I don't really care for commercial tubes in the first place. But, If your not concerned with power and dead set on tubes I would recommend the Trumark RRT tubes."
4,Minnie Mouse watch,"Fun, wondering how long the battery will last since it is an older model. The second hand is very useful. Too small to have Minnie's arms as the moving parts."
5,Never a dull moment!,"Tooth&Nail records once again gives us a cd, we can just sit back, close our eyes, and soak in the tunes. I had the privelege of seeing e101 at Emo's in Austin, TX. Their live show doesn't hold back anything; the stage itself was sweating for pete's sake. Crissie is one of those lyricists that we could only DREAM to be in the same position as. I've had lyrics that have grabbed me, but not lyrics that have grabbed and SHAKEN me! Very strong! Sounding like a modern day Pearl Jam thrown in a blender with old school Bryan Adams (SUMMER OF '69!), and with a little White Diamonds perfume, e101 has already rocked your socks off, but you just don't know it yet. JERSEY REPRESENT!"
3,Pretty Good.,"Wow, a poppy punk band with a girl as their lead singer! That alone made me take a listen to Element 101. And from what I've heard so far, it's pretty good. Some people may disagree with me on this, but the songs on this album remind me of Saves the Day (particularly in 'Stay What You Are') only with a female at the helm. The fact that they're Christian doesn't really factor in this for me...good music is good music. I haven't listened to every single track, but 'Standing at the Edge of Night' and 'A Faithful Fascination' are good tracks. I'll probably listen to this band when I'm sick of Jordan from NFG or Chris Conley from Saves the Day's somewhat whiny voices."
3,a lot of build up for disappointment,American Skin is a great book with a lot of gritty storylines and characters. It explains the downward spiral that character goes through very well. You get a lot of backstory into most of the characters but the ending turns out to be very disappointing. It turns out to be an Irish No Country for Old Men. The first and second act is great and nicely done but you end up ripped off from a proper finale.
1,See Moniker's Review,"On page 179 a minor character's name changes from Bob to Bill. Lest you think it was a mere typo, ""Bill"" is then mentioned by name five times on p. 179. Then his name changes back to Bob.A nitpick on my part? Maybe.But when I see things like this in novels I wonder how much time and effort was really put into them by the author, the editor and the publisher.I've read all of Bruen's stuff and there seems to be a precipitous downhill slide. His three current books are all marked by minor, yet jarring, errors. This one, in Ammunition a key character has a change of eye color and in Cross protagonist Jack Taylor grits his teeth even though they were, to a molar, all knocked out a few installments ago.Sad."
4,Techno? Mmmmm.....,"Techno eh? Do not buy this CD and expect to hear any techno songs on it. This isn't a techno CD, its a Trance CD, and there is a massive differance between the 2. Don't get me wrong, this CD still has some of the finest cuts from European dance floors, its just the marketing of the CD is wrong. To call a cd techno, then slam trance on it is to me false advertising. However, ATB and the rest of the trancers that appear on this are all in fine form, big euro-trance riffs and massive breakdowns are the order of the day. Good stuff."
2,was expecting more,"to me , the scent was not a good vanilla at all. and there was very little real scent or fresh feeling. was very pleased with seller however. speedy delivery!"
1,just covers odors,"I had been using ""Oust"" lately and was very happy with it until I saw this one was just a little cheaper. I never understood what people meant about ""covering odors"" until I purchased this product. That's the extent of it. This does absolutely nothing but add a citris odor to the odors already in the room. I was forced here to review this product just because it doesn't work. Save your money and just skip this one."
4,Tales From the Brothers Grimm and the Sisters Weird,This book is full of variations of many famous fairy tales. I was particually interested in the varition of Rumpelstiltskin. Velde also wrote a book called the Rumpelstiltskin problem which includes one of these stories which creativly shows the different twists of the story! Very interesting.
5,Wonderfully twisted tales!,"This was a wonderful book! I especially liked STRAW INTO GOLD. It was really good with a bit of a surprise ending. It had just enough magic, not too much like other fairy tales."
4,A decent CD from a non-existent band,"Yet what seems like another NYC punk band that breaks up as its album is released. Despite that this album is pretty good. After having seen them live, I though that there would be more ska style songs on the album, but alas I was wrong. The punk songs are not as hardcore as INDK's ""brother"" band Leftover Crack or ""mother"" band Choking Victim, and are in fact more poppy, if that's the right word, melodic might be better. Songs of note are Tracks 2,3,5 and 14 the hidden track (sorry, but I forget the song titles). If you like Leftover Crack, INDK is a must buy and I actually think that they are or were a much better band."

3,"Get Backers Rocks, TokyoPop, not so much","I honestly don't understand the other reviews. Yes, Get Backers in and of itself is pretty awesome, but the translations are just horrible. Ginji and Ban go back and forth calling each other ""Bro"", which is insanely annoying. The constant use of stupid dialogue detracts from the greatness of the series. It's extremely disappointing how much TokyoPop went out of their way to destroy this series. I don't know why they would sabotage themselves this way, but they did. This whole series is an example of why Manga translations are so bad. If they would just stick to translating and making it make sense instead of trying to make it cool maybe it'd be better.i am extremely disappointed with just how manhandled this series is. It's such a disappointment and it's just going to cause people to run from a great series that they should be flocking to."
1,Battery Bomb,"What a rip-off. I bought two Sea Doo Explorers. Used them last summer and loved them. Pulled them out for this summer and both batteries were dead and would not recharge. I bought two new batteries in June and now they came with labels that say you have to recharge the battery within 24 hours after use, and if not in use, you have to charge them AT LEAST every 3 months. So I tried to recharge them both after 2 months and they are both dead and will not charge. Another $400 down the drain. How can Sea-Doo even put their name on a product like this?"
5,Hours of fun!,I bought this for my 11year old granddaughter who spends a few hours a day in the pool during our short Canadian summers. She has already had hours of fun with her Sea Scooter and is using it with her snorkel or without. She absolutely loves it!I would recommend to anyone purchasing this to also buy an extra battery.Sea Doo Dolphin Sea Scooter
1,Recorder did not work.,The recorder was defective. Recordings sounded like a chipmunk. The seller gave me a refund. I was so disappointed with the purchase as Iy was a gift for my granddaughter.
4,Lynch Fans Only...,This is a classic album - if you're a Lynch or Doomsday fan. Not for everyone by any stretch of the imagination. Real Talk: The Plague is one of the hottest they've ever put together.
5,5 or 5 easy,"i don't see how some of these people comin on here givin tha cd a 1/5 stars rating. this cd fulla tight beats...i wish amazon would put some clips up so everyone could hear what i'm talkin about. and on top of havin good beats they got Lynch, Eklypss, Playboy 7 and Pit tearin it up with some sicc lyrics. anybody who gave this cd a low rating either hasn't heard it or has somethin against Lynch or Doomsday...or just doesn't kno good music. i'm giving this 5/5 cause it was that good...Lynch By Inch will be even better tho. sup Playboy...good [stuff]!"
5,Good,This cd pretty tight manily for the production great beats to bump to in your car....Lynch holds it down like usually but playboy 7 kinda sucks like one reviewer said he talks to much about girls....The other like pit and eklypss are great so get this if u like hardcore gangsta rap or horrorcore rap then get this....
2,NOT DOOMSDAY!!!!!!,"First of all I am not some rap music amateur. I have only the best tastes in underground horrorcore music. I have heard it all. I highly anticipated this release being very pleased with lynch hungs loaded album and season of tha siccness and doomsdays xv, pray 4 me, and filthy.But this title did not live up to expectations. They have a new washed up kind of style that just isnt as solid as their previous music. Its almost like their trying to appeal to a new kind of mainstreem music type of crowd. THEY JUST DIDNT STAY TRUE TO THE REAL HORRORCORE RAP STYLE. check p-folks, sicx, first degree,and all other d-day and lynch cds for their best work."
1,What Happened?,"Aiight i read what playboy 7 said, but to tell u the truth i never liked playboy 7 because all he talks about is girls and that aint siccmade. Lynch, eklypss, and the pit are tight and they are horrorcore, hardcore, ganksta, killa and all that. They have always been. Once i heard about doomsday and lynch were making a CD together, I went out and bought it quick. But Lynch and eklypss are my favorite on this album, but i agree kinda with the guy that said Not Doomsday. Come on Redrum, 4 minute murda, embrace the darkness, u can't say that doomsday and lynch aren't horrorcore, the only one who isn't is playboy 7."
1,Not The Best,"One other thing, the beats on this CD are the [...]iest beats i heard from lynch and doomsday. Get a new guy to make your beats seriously. Thats one other reason why i didnt like this album, your beats [...] except for a couple. But dont give up juss stay sicc made and kick playboy 7 out of Doomsday please!Thanks"
2,info I already know,"I wasn't overly impressed by this book. I thought it would be new information that would help me talk to my kids about ""stranger danger"" but it was really everything that's already been told to my kids. Same stuff they learn in school and on TV. Nothing new.Nicely written, easy to understand language.Would not recommend this book if looking for new information."
1,I threw it away in disgust,"I read this book back in 1991 and did so in little over a couple of hours, throwing it away immediately afterwards. It's like this guy absolutely hates Elvis and everything related to Elvis. He speaks of absurdities that would not make sense even if Elvis had been a cave man. Such things as his lack of hygiene and strange bathroom habits tell exactly what kind of rubbish you're in for if you purchase this book. Stay away, if not for the memory of Elvis, for your own sake."
1,Cynnical Goldman,"I have been Elvis' number one fan for the past 49 years. I own all concerts, movies, songs, books but I'll never spend a dime on anything Goldman does. There will never be another Elvis in our lifetime or anyone else's. He is and always will be The King. What a lonely life he had to leave but what he left us is a timeless legacy never to be forgotten.Patti Hebert RossBeaumont TX"
4,"HUMANIZING A ""KING""","Goldman (or is it ""COLDMAN""?), does indeed become sarcastic at times, and his desciption of certain events are emblazoned with the MAD MAGAZINE SEAL OF APPROVAL. Yet his stitching together of Presley's career and life, doesn't seem to deviate from the accounts offered by Elvis' own ""Memphis Mob"". If anything, after reading this unauthourized bio, I feel more in touch with Elvis than ever, and also have a decidely more positive view of Elvis. I really feel for the man. Moreover, I appreciate his work more than ever, and share with Elvis his dream of being a serious actor. I despise Colonel Tom, and see the ""inner circle"" for the manipulative and exploitive parasites they were. Seems to me, Goldman was the best person to pen this bio, as he is somewhat grandiose as well. Perhaps we all are. Even the King! In a left-handed way, thats a compliment to Elvis. He was just like you and me."
3,Can't make up my mind!,"Like it or not, this book was at times pretty entertaining,sad and shocking. I love Elvis(been to Graceland)and i don't like him portrayed as a pathetic man.Reading this book made me sad more than anything else.I don't believe that Elvis committed suicide, he was so sick he didn't need to.I also don't have any faith in the sources Goldberg uses throughout the book. I liked the picture of the floorplan of Graceland in the middle.So, make up your own mind."
4,Hilarious Book,"The hard core Elvis fans take themselves (and Elvis) way too seriously. Goldman may be prone to hyperbole, but it's damn entertaining. Besides, he's just relating what those close to Elvis told. If Memphis Mafia (the guys) recall that Elvis installed two-way mirrors all over the house, or that his LA parties amounted to nothing more than everybody watching Elvis watch TV, with everyone laughing at anything stupid thing he said, then why not write about it? I ended up liking Elvis more than ever after reading this hilarious book. I think Goldman's treatment of the Colonel as the Carny was right on the money!"
1,Not entirely accurate.,"This book tries to drive home the fact Elvis committed suicide. He was supposed to have ""saved up"" his ""attacks"", as he called them, of sleeping pills and demerol injections. He then alledgedly took three doses on an empty stomach and expired. People who know Elvis insist he would not have done this because of his love for Lisa Marie. Granted, his death coincided with the release of the book entitled ""Elvis, What Happened"", written by members of the ""Memphis Mafia"". Also, there was no note left by Elvis... something very hard to believe would have been omitted had he taken his own life. For the true Elvis fan, a definite waste of time"
1,Elvis book: Typical Goldman trash.,"The late Albert Goldman first established himself as the king of trash bios with his conjecture-ridden, wholly inaccurate Elvis biography in 1982. He later retained that title with his stupid and unfactual John Lennon bio (in which he accused Lennon of murder!). This new book about Elvis carries on the tradition. This book takes incredible liberties with facts and completely downgrades the person of Elvis as a cultural icon. The stuffy and elitist Goldman mocks Presley as a fat, no-talent, drug drenched, Southern redneck good ole boy and falls just barely short of labeling all Presley fans as dupes and fools. A complete waste of money and time."
3,another one over there,"Japanese Photographer/writer, Shinya Fujiwara took the same approach to Mt.Fuji in his photo bookcalled ""Zokai Fuji"" way back 2000! worth checking out. You doen't need to be a Gaijin or put youself in a pigeon hole on purpose to capture the modern Fuji...http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/images/4103692022/ref=dp_image_0?ie=UTF8&n;=465392&s;=books"
3,"Excellent photographs, bad book format","I agree with all the reviewers that the 200+ photographs in the book are first-class. The names of Art Wolfe, David Muench, John Shaw, and Willian Neil alone should guarantee that much. The only big complaint I have is that a lot of large-format photographs are splitted onto twoadjacent pages (about 3/4 on one page and 1/4 on the other page). This essentially ruins the composition of those beautifule photographs because it naturually draws your eyes to the split area, regardless of the photographers' intended focus. (In fact, in a number of photographs, the focus is in the split area). Instead of the book's 9 in x 12 in portrait format, they should have used the 12 in x 9in landscape format to avoid the two-page split. Mr. Middleton has a lot to learn about book design. As is, I don't think the book is worth its full [item price]. If you want to have it, buy it used at cheaper prices."
5,very beautiful. well done.,This is a most facinating book with the writings and photography excellent in every way. I am very impressed with all of it.
4,A Must-have for all who appreciate nature,"This is a beautiful and well-produced book. Truly a representation of the creme of the crop of american nature photographers. It is both inspiring in it's illustration of some of the country's most beautiful wild areas -- and a strong reminder that we must preserve these areas for the future. I have been fortunate enough to meet the authors and some of the photographers represented in the book, and I am truly impressed by their amazing dedication to their craft and their sincere love and concern for nature. It is evident in these images. I only wish it was larger so the images could be reproduced over one page. Highly recommend."
4,A must read... a real eye-opener.,"An enlightening foray into the concerns of Native Americans heretofore unknown and/or unrecognized by white Americans. Masterfully edited by Churchill, the book discusses Marxist ideology and the Native Americans' place within it. Particularly powerful is Russell Means' piece on the ""European mentality"". Truly an eye-opener."
4,I had specific purpose,"For picking up this book, and it didn't satisfy me completely, but it did give me a much greater insight into the difference between Marxist communism and the kind of communism that the native tribes had pre-contact. I would prefer a little more recognition by the writers that distinguishes the two - only one, for instance, mentioned spirituality. That Marx could even have intimated that the tribes here in the U.S. would be interested in being 'equal' laborers on land that used to be theirs shows he had a complete lack of understanding about their type of communism."
1,One terrible product,"I bought this because I have a Toshiba, and Toshibas are notoriuos for having bad air circulation (I didn't know this until I'd had the laptop for over 2 years, I thought it was just mine).This is a terrible product. Its cheap and plastic, there are three fans, but one hardly ever works, and the other two barely move. It isn't wide enough for the feet on my laptop to sit on it, so my laptop sits directly on top of it, not allowing for any type of air flow.Also, the fans are not placed very well. Nowhere near my computer's two fans."
2,Almost Worked For a While,"Upon receiving, it was very apparent that this was very low quality (you get what you pay for).It kept my laptop noticeably cooler (though still fairly warm) for about two weeks. After that, the wiring pulled loose. I opened it up and soldering the wires back together. It worked again for another week, then it completely stopped working."
3,Works great - wiring does not last long,This cooling pan works great. The only problem is the open back which caused deep scratches on my furniture before I realized it.The wiring pulled loose after a few months and we have had to tape back together. Would be great if they could fix those items.
2,Useless,"I bought this book to learn more about the vintage Mercedes cars that are out there, as I am considering the purchase of one. Not only is the writing boring and the pictures blurry and faded, the author has also decided to skip some of the most important models manufactured by Mercedes over the years. Where is the w123, for example?After the beautiful Vespa book I bought, this volume just doesn't do it for me. Save your money and buy a Mercedes book with great reviews."
2,Great if you want satin...but not at all like silk,"These are very nice pillow cases, but they are not at all what I wanted. If I had wanted cases made of satin, that is what I would have chosen. The name of the product as well as the information given describes these as silk-like. Silk and satin are two very different fabrics. I didn't expect them to be exactly like real silk at this low price, but these have nothing in common with silk at all.So, if you would like satiny pillow cases, buy these. They are nicely sized and washed well. Lovely, but not what I wanted."
1,Save your money,"I'm not impressed with the quality, and one pillowcase has stains on it (looks like oil)? I did wash them as soon as I received them, but the stains are still there. Also my delivery was 3 days late and I had to leave 40 cents for postage due. Hmmm I did pay for S/H. (not about the 40 cents,but I don't get it)"
2,Silk?,"The pillowcases are soft enough but don't fit on a king sized pillow, 1/4 of the pillow sticks out the end."
2,Some songs work better in the movie!!!,"I absolutely love the ""ME WITHOUT YOU"" movie and I THOUGHT I loved the music in the movie. However, once I had the CD on, I found myself trying TOO hard to envision the part of the movie when the song was played! The songs just did not have enough of their own inner visual (the little dance in my brain when I hear a song that I love) for me to enjoy them on their own. I'll continue to think of Oliver Milburn singing in his underwear, but for the CD, it's in my ""FOR ANOTHER TIME"" bin (a.k.a. my junk drawer). SORRY!"
5,Thank you,We are looking forward to our summer vacation this year at Yellowstone and trying to get all the information and resources we can. Hopefully this book will help.
3,first documentary but outdated now,"this book was published in the 80's. unlike what is mentioned in the book, clomiprmine is available now in the USA and it barely mentiones the wonder drug called luvox or fluvoxamine maleate. the book documents other sufferes of OCD. though it offers little in what to do to recover. but its a good read."
4,Un libro muy útil,"He encontrado el libro muy útil, tanto para personas con el trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo como para personas interesadas en estudiar el tema. Es especialmente recomendable para aquellas personas que padecen este trastorno y aún no tienen sobre él ningún tipo de tratamiento o información psicológica."
4,The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Washing,"I had to read this book for my psychology class and when it was assigned I thought it was going to be so boring. But in fact it was very interesting to see what people with OCDs go through. I never really knew that there were so many different types of OCD. I found this book very interesting for both people who are not suffering from an OCD and those who are. It is a very informative book. It contains stories from the patients' and their families' point of views with the doctors perspective some where in the middle. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to know about OCDs, whether you or someone you know are suffering from an OCD, or if you just think it would be an interesting topic. This book is very interesting even for those like me who are not ever going to major in Psychology!"
2,Outdated regarding treatment.,"This book only describes the most ocmmon types of OCD. In addition, it is old, and the treatment options are completely outdated. We found this unnecessarily depressing."
3,"fascinating case studies, but....","I had this book on my wish list forever, and finally gave up and bought it for myself just recently. Some of the case studies were fascinating, but overall the book was somewhat disappointing, especially considering how long I had looked forward to reading it. Undoubtedly, part of the problem is that the book is now 15 or so years old (it is now 2007), and so what seemed like breathless new insights about the prevalence and nature of OCD at the time now seem very obvious. But also, the material wasn't presented in a very organized way, and I was left with the impression of a lot of redundancy and more philosophy than hard information. All in all, a bit of a let-down."
5,"""Its the best book for you ,if your loved one has O.C.D.",This book is the best scorce of infomation about helping you overcome procrastinations.I have O.C.D. and read this book alot.I found out that the book taugh me how to relax all my thoughts!
4,Good Read,I liked the book aside from it being a bit out dated (i would have liked it if they appended some sort or update with the patients and research going on past 1988) it was very insightful for the time it was written it took a good look at the disease when no one really understood it. I thought she wrote in a way that made it easy for everyone to understand not just the MDs.
2,Would not get again...,"This is my 2nd paddle brush. My previous one had straight, thin bristles. The bristles on this brush look like little plastic nails - the bristle comes out of the base of the brush and then there is a plastic knob at the top of the bristle. The bristles' tops catch in my hair and yank the bristles right out of the brush. After 3 months, I probably lost about 20% of the bristles."
4,Nicely done debut from new electro darlings...,"Voodou got their start with Underground Inc. (the label that released this fine album) through the Notes From Thee Real Underground project, along with numerous other bands that found their niche in the invisible underground, and they certainly deserved the shot. Smooth vocals from a gorgeous lead singer combine nicely with the hard hitting industrial pop that Voodou makes their call with. If you enjoy My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult or perhaps the Lords of Acid more industrial moments, or if you just like female fronted industrial (Meg Lee Chin, Ruby, Pigface) check this out today!"
2,Is it lust or anger?,"Well,I really was expecting more from an this Invisible signing-they were talked up so much,but listening to the disc leaves me feeling very dissconnected. It is obvious where they want to go,but getting there was maybe pushed too hard? It's all in the process,not the goal. They got somewhere,somehow,but TBOC just seems,like one other reviewer said,""mapped out""-standard EBM/industrial/goth sentiment. I don't like feeling manipulated,and that's how I felt after listening to this cd. Like all the ingredients were in the pot,but the soup tasted like ones I've had before.If they can get some freshness(the problem with most genres of music),maybe they could break out all over and not just with label-mates."
3,Perhaps biased,"This book was the required text for an independent study class I enrolled in. The class has been more difficult than I thought it would be, as has the text. It is complex material and doesn't provide a lot of clear-cut examples - instead assuming that you make the connection yourself. However, I am learning all on my own and the material may be more understandable with the help of a live professor."
1,not worth your time or money,"I read this book, or half of it, on Kindle and found it to be a dull, liberal, hectoring waste."
2,DISAPPOINTED,"I realize Mr. Halberstam edited this book and wrote only one one its many essays. Nevertheless, his name is on the cover and he receives royalties (I assume)so he has to be taken to task. Obviously I expect far, far better from Mr. Halberstram. Of the many essays in the book from a wide range of writers, only a couple are even worthy of reading. A definite skip - don't waste your time."
5,"Hypnotic, Echanting, Experimental & Melodic","Entirely seductive, this music pulls you in and surrounds your mind and heart until you are powerless but to succomb to it's beauty. There are so many influences here, but as is the case with the best music they melt into something that transcends the sum of it's parts. Karmen's voice is gorgeouss, Sami (ex Hanoi Rocks!) plays wonderfully and inventively; everything is as alive as the best poetry. This is pulse quickening, heart racing, dreaming and waking to a deeper dream music."
5,The Best of the West: Hayden Tilden,"Usually books of this genre do not attract my attention nor do I tend to migrate to them; however, I found myself catapulted back in time when living meant surviving; when a man's word stood for everything and when the look of a woman could leave a man's soul breathless. This little western has all the key elements that any testosterone reader would crave but it is by far an extraordinary love story. Lovers of ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator"" will long for each chapter of Hayden Tilden's life. J. Lee Butts richly created characters that will be etched into your mind long after the last turn of the page. So put your spurs on....you are in for one ""hell of a good ride."""
4,comprehensive yet shallow,"An exhaustive list of american built road racers as the cover promises. As one who grew up in the 1960's and spent every race season from 1963 through the early 1980's ""at the track"" I was impressed by the comprehensiveness of the coverage. The disappointment with this work is that it lacks depth. I suppose one can locate specific in depth books on the Reventlow Scarab's and Joe Huffaker (the cover cars), but I would have liked a bit more background, or perhaps a better bibliography for the vehicles in this book."
5,frankie hill....dear lord,the reviewer on top of me pretty much has it all sumed up real nice..i'm just gunna say that this dvd has the most hardcore 80's street skating done by one kid alone....mr frankie hill. he was the only one of his day really skating huge rails and doing big gaps....this kid was a mad man...and is probably the most underated skateboarder of all time.. as far as i know i just kind of dropped off the planet..i heard he sewed powell peralta for injuries or something which is lame but anyways..buy this video...not just because of frankie either...there's this guy named ray barbee in here who is one of the most technical street skaters you will ever see...he could do just about any no-comply variation imaginable..i saw him at zumiez for a go out and skate thing..he was pretty cool. his surf rock band sounded good too..he's a sweet guitarist.
2,Idiotic clip design,"Here's the deal. All the pumps work, but I was interested in this one because it has storage for a second batter. I ordered it. 2 days later I've got it and inspecting it. I knew immediately I was gonna have issues. If you look closely in the picture, you'll notice that the way you upen the top is to pull out and up on the clip......problem is, that's how it pulls when it's clipped to my bait bucket. Any kinda of bump in the car or on the kayak and this think falls off the bucket. It was infuriating. I don't wanna mess with returning something so cheap, so I'm gonna keep it, but I half suspect I'll throw it off my kayak in anger eventually. Don't buy it. Get the wally world bubble bucket aerator."
5,AMERICAN ANGLER FRESHWATER 1.5 VOLT BATTERY OPERATED AERATOR,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERS.WORKS GREAT, EASY TO HANG ON A BUCKET TOO KEEP LIVE BAIT.WORKS GREAT FOR ME BASS FISHING."
1,Do NOT buy these,"These are absolutely POS. We ordered 4, and when they arrived, one was already non-functional. The design is absurd- the ""hook"" you see in the picture is supposed to allow you to hang it on the edge of an aquarium, bucket, etc. but it is also supposed to lock the lid/battery compartment closed. Fat chance. Hanging it by the hook means the lid will open at the worst possible time, dunking you batteries in water (i.e. DEAD) and none of ours have recovered, even with new batteries. Taping the top shut with electric tape sorta works for awhile, but even when functional they produce an anemic air flow that won't even work if the bubble stone is too deep in the bucket (too deep meaning 6""). Just say no."
5,Buy online,"I buy all my Scotch tape online these days. The office store clerks always have their smartass comments that make me feel uncomfortable buying it in the store. This tape works great, although fair warning that even though it is advertised as 450 inches, my last roll only measured out to 441 inches. As with everything else anymore, I guess you learn to live with the occasional defect."
3,missleading,its very thin scotch tape and they dont give you alot on the role dont buy if you use scotch tape all the time you will be out in a day
2,the product has nothing particular,"the price is ok.but the product seems not as good as i thought it must be.thus i prefer transparent tape of this brand.well, still kin to this brand, btw."
1,"I do not beieve what I was told when I confronted customer service, being told that was manufacturers list price ???","What I believe to be false advertizing $21.99 original price for 1 roll of tape, I thought it would be many of the single rolls in clearance. Savings was somewhere round about 90%I think I might have bought one roll cheaper elsewhere. That's my opinion."
2,Poor design and materials,The frames are thick and clunky and quality of the lens isn't very good. As others have indicated it is difficult to apply eye makeup while wearing them because the frame gets in the way. I would recommend a good magnifying mirror instead.
2,ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL,"As far as quality is concerned,this is is really not much different than the other replacement batteries from AT&T.That; seems to be more related to which country or company was the supplier.Electrically they are all comparable,but,it is the physical size that separates one from another.Seems more like a way to sell different types of batteries.Some have connectors and other don't.It is like shoes one size fits the others don't.Always wondered why this item,after a short while was not readily available even from Bestbuy where the phone was purchased.For some reason it was restricted to one AT&T; and Vtech model only so there wasn't much demand for this item.If the shoe store only carries small shoes because they sell better,it won't work if you take a medium shoe.Not much choice here."
4,"Graphic Novel Illuminates ""The Fountain"" for Die Hard Aronofsky Fans","This is a beautiful companion to the stunning movie. It is a quick enjoyable read, and helps to explain some of the things that are left up in the air in the film. I still prefer the film version, but this is very cool too, and I definately recommend it for any Aronofsky fan."
4,qualitative treatment of presumed advantages,"The technical discussion in the book is not very indepth. Though the author does a fair job in simplifying the technical differences between MPEG4 and its predecessors. So that you can get a clear understanding of why perhaps you should use it. The arguments for migrating are qualitative, with no maths needed. At this level, they seem plausible.The authors reinforce this with extended foray into possible business applications and licensing strategies.Each chapter has a brief list of references, that may offer more detailed treatments for the interested reader."
1,Worth the $.01 but no more,The batteries wouldn't hold a charge for more than maybe an hour. A full charge would go to Low Battery overnight without even using the phone. I decided to spring for higher-capacity batteries.
2,Connector mis-wired,"The price was good and the delivery was prompt. Unfortunately, if I buy four batteries I expect that I'll get four batteries that work.I bought four replacement batteries for my elderly mother's phones. The connector on one of the four was wired backwards, so after my mother put all the batteries in, one phone would not return to working and was getting very hot in the charger. After a couple of days I went to her house and found the problem, but by then the battery was completely burned out."
1,very short life,"After several month (less than a year), this battery can not hold for ~30min talking. It is probably due to the low quality of the battery."
5,Quick delivery and great customer service,"Ordered several batteries which were priced nicely and delivered quickly. Had a problem with one battery so sent a message asking for info on how to resolve. Replacement immediately sent out, no questions asked. Appreciated the customer service."
3,CORDLESS PHONE,"Unable to comment since the cordless phone that I purchase this battery for went completely out,phone was too old anyway!"
2,Not AT&T Batteries,"My batteries arrived much sooner than I expected (two days after placing the order). Packaging was acceptable for the small items I purchased. However, I was unhappy to see that they were not the AT & T batteries I thought I had purchased, but General Electric batteries that would `work on most AT &T phones.' I can find nothing in the description above that states that this battery is a substitute brand. I have kept the batteries as they were desperately needed, but I think the page is disingenuous. Because of this, I would not purchase from this vendor in future and could not recommend to others."
1,Battery for ATT Cordless Phone,I am very dissappointed by my purchase. I purchased two batteries to replace the old ones in my phones.Battery #1 was dead. It never workedBattery #2 charges to 1/2 power never to 100%I am not happy at all with my purchase.
1,Crappy,"First, I had to have the 3 I bought sent to a friends house because they wouldn't recognise my address. They worked good for 3 months, now they won't hold a charge for a 5 minute call. Not worth the $2.88 I payed for them."
4,Actual battery NOT as pictured,"The battery I received did not look like the one in the advertised picture. There was NO writing on the outer packaging of the battery that was sent. It was solid white plastic - no number, no info. Also, the wires were a tad short and would not fit into the outlet, so I had to turn the battery around so the wires would be long enough. So far, however, the battery is working and holding a charge, so that is good."
1,"Good Features, Bad Quality Sound","I really liked the easy to use features of this machine when I saw it at the store. However, the sound quality fades in and out so bad I just had to take it back to the store."
1,Don't buy this maching,"I bought this answering machine when my AT&T manufactured one (that I had owned for five years) broke. This sony machine is terrible. The worst feature is the recording of our message asking people to leave their name and number. It is scratch, and very difficult to hear."
3,TAM-100 out of the box.,"Just bought this machine as a companion to the Sony cordless phone model SPP-ID975, and am astounded at the poor quality of the chip generated voice system. Attempting to understand the instructions of the chip generated voice, or the information it tries to relay concerning general operation, is futile. About 80% of the sound comes out sounding like gibberish. Recorded messages are quite a bit clearer, but nothing compared to the old tape recording systems. And from what I can determine, you must manually delete all your own old messages. According to the instructions, the machine doesn't do this automatically. I tried it, and after two or three tries, finally got the machine to delete all the messages in a mail box. Also, the instructions state that if there is a power loss, the recorder looses it's time and date info. I'm returning the machine. There has to be something on the market better than this."
1,Hated It.,I never took the time to find out if most of the features on this machine worked. The sound quality was so poor that I returned it 2 days after I got it. I expected much more out of a Sony product.
1,Not Typical of Sony,I got as far as recording the OGM and when the machine played my voice back - I put it back in the box and returned it. The playback is far from true to life. Do not buy this product. Typically - I only buy Sony - but i will make this one exception to the rule.
1,Stay away from this one...,"I bought this machine about a year ago and have not been satisfied since. The sound quality (as others have mentioned) is horrible. The three mailboxes are nice, but callers can never figure out how to get to the right box...even I can't...you have to push * or # or something then the number of the box, and only while the message is being played. Talk about badly designed. Sony was great and replaced the unit when we complained about sound quality, but the new one they sent was just as bad. I don't have any other suggestions, since I haven't found a satisfactory answering machine yet. (Oh, and new Sony machines...same problem)"
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this Answering Machine thinking that it would be a good machine as it's from Sony. As well I have a cordless phone which is great and an Alarm clock all great from Sony. This machine is [junk], Right now it's still in the box and I am back to the voice mail from my telephone company. One thing I did like on the unit was the ""Beep"" to let you know you had a message and that you didn't have to acutally go to the machine to find out that you had no messages. The pre-recorded greeting was also a nice feature one that I used becuase people could not understand what I was saying in to the machine when I recroded my greeting. Overall good design but poor quality...."
3,Decent Machine,I got an early digital answering machine from AT&T (when they really were built by AT&T) when they first came out. I think the Sony is the fifth one I have owned. Every machine I have bought since has gotten junkier. The last one my wife bought was a Conair (that's the one the store carried). That lasted less than a year.So I did an search for Sony and bought this. The Sony quality is better than the last two I have owned. It was easy to program and the voice quality isn't any worse than the previous ones that I have had.Digital answering machines are just junky now. This one seems OK.
2,"Poor sound quality, won't shutoff when telephone answered.","With the exception of two major problems, this would be a good telephone answering machine for home use.The sound quality is absolutely horrible. It is nearly impossible to record a custom announcement message that callers can understand, and recorded messages left by callers are often garbled and also difficult to understand.The real problem for us is that when a phone call is answered from an extension phone while the answering machine is either performing it's announcement, or receiving a caller's message, this answering machine won't shut off. Having to ask the caller to hold on (If they can understand you over the garbled noise of the recorded announcement, while you run to the answering machine to turn it off is a real pain... especially when you can't turn it off in such a situation. The only remedy we've come up with is to unplug the machine in order to accept the call and carry on a conversation."
2,Not very reliable,"I have had this answering machine 3 months and now it answers the phone only when it wants to. It sometimes works right, when it does its a good machine. Sony is looking at it now to try and repair it, cant be a good seller, the Sony service center never new they made answering machines. Sound quality is ok, could be better."
4,"Tough, thorough prep for the MCAT, with some flaws.","This is a good book with some helpful tips on how to prepare for the MCAT verbal section. Be forewarned, however, that the questions in the book are tough and that some of the questions do not necessarily represent the type of questions you will see on the actual MCAT. Kaplan does a better job by presenting you with questions more similar to the actual MCAT."
5,The best verbal reasoning preparation I have ever seen,This book is a great find if you are studying for the MCAT. I have found it difficult to improve my reading speed and comprehension studying on my own and even using a prep course. This book gave me new and real strategies to significantly improve my verbal reasoning. I am scoring much better on practice exams after working through this book. I even had fun working through it!
2,Not what I expected,"The watch is child sized. It didn't fit right. If the circumference of your wrist is about 6 inches like mine, it may not be a comfortable fit. Cute design and watch face, just not for me."
3,928 Performance Portfolio review,"A rather dated, but interesting collection of magazine re-prints covering most models (globally) of the fantastic 928, right up to the GT. Good for facts and figures, but all reviews rahter biased towards the car."
1,"Will This Brutal ""Therapy"" Cease?!","The book brazenly presents coercive restraint (aka Holding Therapy, Rage Reduction, Attachment Therapy, Cuddletime, etc.) as effective therapy, when it is specifically outlawed in most states and is considered unethical by all mental health professional organizations.This book glorifies the sort of brutal treatment of children that child protective workers are meant to investigate and stop.I was blown away that the authors put, at the top of their recommended resources list, a 1995 CBS story ""Afraid of Our Children"" (48 Hours) where children are literally tortured. See for yourself from this clip:[...]No surprise that all of the other wacky Attachment Therapy beliefs about Reactive Attachment Disorder and child development are also found in these pages."
4,Warth can last a long time in are hearts,"I throughly enjoyed the insight into Don Rickles and life. I grew up watching my parents in awe of his comic quips and back then, I never got it. As I grew older, I realized some were off the cuff silly. But others were just leveling jabs to bring down people to the same playing field. What he says in his act was just what he explains at the end, which is, everybody, everything is fair game. We are all human and life is too short without laughter so he makes fun of himself and others regardless of the taboos he undertakes. this video opens that all up and if you pay attention it will make you , maybe, refect on your ownlife. Don's great and when the time comes for his passing, we will be losing one of the last giants of that golden age of comedy. You really muct see this video! AAAA++++"
3,This is a documentary,"I wanted those who are considering to buy this to know this is a documentary and not one of his stage shows. With help from a whole host of celebrities, including Mr. Rickles himself, his career is told in a very heart warming way.I must admit I was taken back at the stark change Rickles goes through. Offstage he is a very timid, mild man I hardly recognized, but as soon as he hits the stage a whole new persona emerges. Again, it's only very short clips of a show in Vegas. Lots of commentary by all and back history of his television and movie accomplishments. Kind of a ""This Is Your Life""I found it mildly amusing. I couldn't imagine watching this more than once."
1,If you do not mind foul language and some nasty parts.,Guess I am an old fogie. Nothing like was on tv.A lot of foul language.My fault. Didn't check the rating on it.
3,Boring video for me,Too many interviews and not enough Rickles material. And more profanity than I expected. This is not my father's Rickles.
4,Interesting,This DVD is a very interesting take on Don Rickles. It is not just a taped version of his comedy act. The comments from other entertainers and the history of Las Vegas combined with clips from Rickles' performances make this more of a biography of his life. I enjoyed it.
2,The reason I gave it a 2 star is because I got a dvd that was ruined. I need to buy another one and hope it would be perfect .,"Hopefully the second dvd of Mr. Warmth would be a better one because the first one was ruined by the time I got it. Every time I watch it the dvd would stall. If I didn't like the comedian and the video, I wouldn't try to get another one. So I guess I will be taking a chance in getting another Don Rickles' Dvd. From an unsatisfied customer..."
3,Lacks Mr. Rickles stage show,While this is a great tribute to Don Rickles and I think he's great this DVD should have came as a double disk set. One disk for the tribute and the other with an uncensored version of his stage show. Now that would have been something to buy not to mention historical.
2,Off Course,"I watched this program on HBO. While there were some funny moments, I felt director John Landis lost the documentary's focus. The program became less a tribute to Don Rickles and his impact on comedy and more a history of Las Vegas and a tribute to the way gangsters ran the city.I also thought there were some glaring omissions in the choice of film clips that were shown: There was no footage from the special, expanded segment of Mr. Rickles' appearance on ""The Dean Martin Show,"" in which a star-studded audience was assembled for him to insult; there were no clips from ""CPO Sharkey,"" the only TV series Don Rickles starred in that made it to a 2nd season; and there was no clip of the famous segment from ""The Tonight Show"" in which Mr. Rickles walked onto the program while Johnny Carson was in a Japanese bath."
3,A Fairly Blunt Tool,"Have you ever just 'wished' a movie/documentary could be better? I was hoping for a real tribute to Don Rickles but I was disappointed in the production and editing of Mr. Warmth. I imagine he won't be around too much longer (he may prove me wrong!) but I hope there is enough old footage out there to really do a 'knock it outta the park' job on a better version of this funny, edgy career."
2,What fans really wanted was a full standup routine :(,Rickles is an 82 yr old comedy legend and we have very little footage of his standup routine on film. I suppose we never will now. :(
2,i think it (...),"well, first of all, i think the plot (...), i dont like gexs atitude, and maybe i am young but i still think itd be better without the ""adult content"" in it...but it is kinda neat and funny like chasing snowboarding snowmen and stuff...i really cant tell u what to think of it...youd have to rent it and see for yourself... me, i dont like it"
2,"had potential.... WAY TOO irritating, boring and ...","repetitive! Some bad reviews make you wonder if the person bothered to learn the game enough to enjoy it... or if they know how to play these games... Well I have played Gex for several unfortunate hours.... I've completed many more challenging games, and this is the WORST (also the only game I never bothered to finish)Crash Bandicoot... ape Escape, Oddworld series are all challenging excellent games... save your money on Gex to buy them!"
2,big dissapointment,"This is defenitly the worst game that I have ever owned! From the overused lines during gameplay to the boring overall game's story. There were lines (as in quotes) during the gameplay that made it so annoying that I turned off the sound. You had to repetedly play the levels to get all objectives done, way to hard. The moves that you must use to complete things are too complicated and could be made much easier. I promptly traded it in after about 2 weeks of failed attempts to beat the second level. Very fruserating, don't bother."
5,Need for speed!,"This stick is great! Yesterday I took about 40 pics and 30 small videoclips with my Cybershot! And it wasn't even full! Try doing THAT with the 4MB card! No really, it's a must-have! The 4MB just isn't large enough, it's actually about the same size as a ordinary roll of film, that is, enough room for about 30-40 pics at 640x480, wich isn't all that much. BUY!"
1,This is a PRO duo even though it's not listed as such,"This is a PRO duo memory stick even though it's not listed as such, and it does not fit in my camera. I was specifically looking for a non-PRO duo because I didn't want to have to buy an adapter. If I wanted to go with the PRO duo-adapter setup, I would certainly have bought one with more memory than 16 MB."
5,From the Publisher,"""By the beginning of the seventeenth century, a growing interest in botany and an increasing passion for gardening among the wealthy gave rise to the florilegium (a gathering of flowers), a book in which flowers were depicted lavishly and in detail.

3,Not One Of The Best,I have read all of the books in the series so far and this is not one of the best. This is a good writer but I don't think that he put all that he could've in this book. It starts in the middle so you better read the rest of the books in the series before this one. The book is kind of slow and about which group will take over Mother. I have read the next book in the series though and it is by far better than this one so you kind of have to read this one first. Have Fun!!!
1,Not the best design for bluebirds,"This house is best suited to urban and suburban yards that don't have a bluebird within miles, but want a birdhouse for decoration. I'd wager these houses have raised more house sparrows than bluebirds by a huge factor. I'd recommend a front-opening box like the Audubon box if you really want to raise bluebirds. Better yet, consult with an experienced bluebirder in your area."
4,Excellent birdhouse,I installed the birdhouse and within a week a bluebird has occupied it. It is well made. I did put some wood sealant on the roof to make it more weatherproof. I would buy it again.
2,broken,Received broken. A nail in the roof splintered a piece off. I glued it with rubber cement instead of dealing with the hassle of a return. It worked
4,Bluebird house,"Didn't have any bluebirds first year, then changed location. Mounted on pole and we have bluebirds now."
4,Hip & functional,"This clock is hip. In terms of functionality, the two alarms are convenient (especially if you're a snoozer) - you can set the first one to the radio, then the second one to the buzzer. And it'll let you snooze for a full hour! It's a little on the difficult side to set up the alarms for the first time, but after that easy to use. The only thing I don't like about it is the LCD tilts down a little bit (you can kind of tell in the picture) so needs to be set on a shelf/nightstand that is at least as high as your bed."
3,Cute form...,"...but a little lacking in function. My biggest problem might be a little nit-picky, but when the alarm is set on buzzer, if you turn it off, the radio does not stay on. This was one of the best functions of my old alarm clock. It keeps you from falling back into a dead sleep. Instead, I passed right out again. But it is a good-looking alarm clock. If that's important to you."
1,BAD ADVICE!,"This book is full of bad advice. She recommends using Pine which is almost as bad for rats as Cedar is! And some of the pictures in the book are of mice, not rats. ..."
2,Inaccurate,"This book is full of information but unfortunately gives some very poor advice for any rat owner. Pine and cedar will both cause respiratory problems in rats, which can lead to ill health and secondary infections. Also, many of the pictures in this book are of mice.If you buy this book, please keep in mind - no pine or cedar bedding for rats! Much better is The Rat (An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet) by Ginger Cardinal (Howell Book House) or Rats! (A Fun & Care Book) by Debbie Ducommun (Bowtie Press) ."
4,gREAT INFO FOR RAT newbies,"I found this great for me when I got my rats since i knew little or nothing about them. Now that i have had them a few years and have gone online for info. I can tell you, it's a great guide for NEWBIES but I also found there to be as much info online.If i read it now, i would say tell me something I dont know. But, if you have never owned one of the cutties..this is the bible of rats"
4,Great,"This is a great ska/punk band formed at Miami University in Oxford Ohio. They are an amazing live band, and this translates well onto their CD. I'd suggest anyone who likes ska or punk along the lines of Reel Big Fish, The Aquabats, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and company to pick this one up."
4,Where have these guys been hiding?,"There style is amazing! The music is semi-typical of this type of group, but mixed with the vocals there is no stopping this band! I love them and would definitely like to get to know Jeff! Buy it, is all I can say."
4,Fun and Erotic Read!,"I found this book to be a fun and exciting read. I finished reading it within 2-days because I found it hard to put down. Once I started one of the stories I had to finish it. Both nights of reading this book I was up until at least 1am. If you are looking for a good story line that is fun, easy to read and erotic - I recommend this book."
1,Size does matter!,"We bought this toy for our 18 month old son, and its way too small for him. Let me first say that he has been between the 40th to 50th %tile for both height and weight his whole life, he is by no means a large kid. He could get in and out of this car but would constantly have problems, then once he was finally in he would run over his own toes, I'm going to try to uplaod pix to show what I mean. For the amount of money we were paying we definitely wanted a toy he would get a lot of use out of and this wouldn't cut it, he was already growing out of it and yet the toy is supposedly designed for ages 1 1/2 and up. We took this back and got the Little Tykes police car and my son loves it!! And best of all its big enough and he doesn't run over his own toes in it!"
2,"good concept, but not as big as other brands","Our son is a rather tall boy and at 21 months we are replacing this car. Our neighbor has the Little Tikes police car which has a larger door and roomier inside. Naturally, he wants to play more with it because he has quite a time getting in and out of his. We are actually replacing this (just had it for 3 months) with the Little Tikes Cozy Coupe tomorrow. I hate that we spent the money but he is tripping over his feet trying to get in the small door. The concept is great, and it might be wonderful for a small child - but for the money, I wish we would have gotten more use out of the car or bought the Little Tikes brand in the first place."
2,very small car,"This car is expensive for what you get and has alot of parts to put it together. But the most surprising thing is how small it is ,I have two other older, very similar cars which an average two or three year old could get in and out of. This car is so small even a very petite two year old can hardly move their feet when sitting in this car.. so the kids don't like it. I do not recommend buying it."
3,Cute Peddle Car,"I bought this car for my 21/2 yr old grandson. He loved it but it was a little small for him. He has trouble using his feet to push the car, not much room to move his feet while sitting in the car. He loves the motor sounds, the fold down seat and driver door that opens."
2,Did not fit a MY Panasonic phone,"I looked at this product and no where does it say that it may not be suitable for all phones. My phone wire tangles and I bought these hoping to improve the problem. Unfortunately they did not fit my Panasonic phone. It would be helpful if they listed which phone it works on/or which it doesn't work on. I suppose that for such a small product that could be cumbersome for the company. At least if we indicate here which phone it DOES NOT WORK ON or which is DOES WORK ON, it may help other Amazon shoppers."
2,These did not fit my phone,"I have an SBC Executive series phone with a cord that gets constantly tangled. I was hoping this would fix the problem; however, this product does not fit the phone because the jack is set back further than these can reach to click in."
2,Warning: MSG inside,"The buyer should be aware that MSG is on the label. Since thelabel does not distinguish between the noodles and the packet,it is not clear whether the packet contains it all.It is also high in palm oil, and I would guess that thisis the noodles. If I had been aware of thesefeatures (there was no contents information) I would not havepurchased it."
4,"Good noodles, good value","The noodles are inexpensive, easy to make, and much more flavorful than the brands found in most American supermarkets."
5,AWESOME VIDEO,"This is janet at her best.With the greatist dance moves, her sultry voice and beauty Janet Jackson gives us one of the best music videos. Songs include 'Thats the way love goes' 'If' 'Again' 'Anytime Anyplace' and 'You want this' .Also alternate and remix versions of the videos PLUS backstage.Pluses are,great sound great show but only I hope it gets realesed on DVD."
1,Riddled with Errors!!!,I have reached problem number 33 out of the 100 offered in this book and I have found over 10 mistakes. Basic design knowledge like P/A + or - M/S escapes this author. This book has hindered my studies at best.
2,DO NOT USE IF YOU STUDY LRFD,"This book still uses ASD for steel design, it has not been updated for LRFD design, and such you get different answers for the steel questions."
2,I got about 6 problems into and quit. Much too involved.,"I started trying to work problems from this book and decided it was a waste of effort. I'm glad I did b/c the exam was no where near as in depth as the problems in this book. I suppose it can't HURT you to study from this book since you might get portions of some these problems on the exam, but all it did to me was freak me out and lower my confidence level. Get the NCEES practice exam book, make sure you have ALL the required codes, the CERM, a good foundation design textbook, and a good mechanics of materials textbook and you'll be good for the structural PE exam. A significant portion was digging stuff out of the codes (April 2012)."
3,"Great performance, horrid sound","The Szell cycle on LP was my inaugural classical music purchase in the early 70s. I know these are great performances, but the sound quality here is no better than my vinyl discs produced when I abandoned them in the mid 80s. If you're just looking for a great, brisk 9th, try Gunter Wand and the NDR. If you're looking for a complete set, you can spend the extra $ and get the more recently remastered Szell cycle (ASIN: B0002CHK6I - I haven't heard these iterations but reviews suggest they're a huge improvement over previous remasterings). Or you can save some money and purchase the world class Zinman/Tonhalle cycle for a fraction of the price.Five stars for the wonderful memories. Two stars off for really poor audio quality."
2,underwhelmed,The good reviews prompted me to buy one and when I received it I now have to second guess that some if not all of these reviews are fake. I ordered the cherrywood color and whoever the monkey was that painted it needs to take a painting course because there has to be no less than 4 different shades of color on it. The wood is CHEAP and feels like I just bought the thing off some bootleg stall on some dark china town street. The hinges on it feel cheap as well and I thought thing was just gonna fall apart on me the moment I took it out. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not 1 is because it stands and it didn't burst into flames or something. This thing is NOT worth $125 more like 40 and that's stretching it still.
5,hairstick,"I love hair sticks, I wear my long hair in a bun alot, these hair sticks work perfect for that. They are also beautiful."
2,A victim of poor quality control,"I purchased this guitar and was dismayed to find some fret buzz up on the neck. So I opted to return it. What I received next certainly looked like the same guitar, but wasn't quite what I was expecting. The fullness and warmth was gone and the fret buzz was markedly worse. I had my luthier try and set it up and restrung the thing with numerous strings, but still the problems persisted. Such poor craftsmanship, whether it's the low rung model or not, is just unacceptable. Especially from a Made in America DX-1. Do yourself a favor and play the thing in person before buying. I hear it's an awesome guitar when they take the time and care to assemble it correctly."
4,a good supplement,"A must have supplement to go along with this text is the the book Damgerous book for boys. It is full of great ideas for extra curricular activies. I have an only child who is home schooled but does a lot of interacting with his friends. He needs more free,yet structured play. Dangerous book for boys offers this. I like how ""What every Third Grader needs to know is formatted. It reminded me of the dnagerous book for boys.So if you are a home schooler of a boy, or a girl look into both books."
2,Pass on this one,this book includes the Story of Sin Bad' and in it they cut off heads - far too graphic for my 8 year old. Who needs that in 3rd grade?We did not find much of anything else that we really liked about the book - keep shopping.
3,A Third Grade Teacher Weighs In,"As a third grade teacher, I agree that this book can be a good supplement to the general knowledge your student should possess. However, I agree that this book is very ethnocentric and glossess over all parts of a solid multicultural curriculum that is CRUCIAL to your child's success in school and life. Feel free to use the book as a home supplement, but do not take the curriculum as the be all end all of third grade. Your child is capable of more than this book allows them to express. Overall, Core Knowledge scares me and other educators that are committed to seeing a country that is not rasist. Use with caution."
4,"Good book, but physical book rips easily","The contents of this book are very useful for third graders as a guideline. I wish there is more math and science emphasis on the book. Still I would rate higher than average books of this type. However as the year progresses, my daughter's book has ripped into two half. I know this is not about the content and Kindle books don't have this issue."
5,Educationally Eye Opening,"I bought the 3rd grade edition, was so impressed I bought the 4th grade edition. These books are awsome. Assist parents in knowing what to expect at these grade levels and what our children should be learning or at least exposed to before secondary schooling. The books contain more information than my child actually completed in each grade reviewing poetry, history, math, grammer, reading comprehension, classic epic stories, old sayings and phrases and their meanings. Great addition to my daughter's educational reference library. Great parent refresher..What Your Third Grader Needs to Know (Revised Edition): Fundamentals of a Good Third-Grade Education (Core Knowledge Series)"
1,MUSCLE PAIN - TOO TECHNICAL,I regretted ordering it; it is too technical. A great knowledge of medicine and physiology is needed to comprehend it. I tried to return it but the seller refused. So I'm stuck with a $60 book that I haven't read and is useless to me.
3,It's okay if you wont be doing alot of math.,I've had much better math books than this one. However it does the job but the examples and things that it covers aren't as good as my other calculus book.
4,Fairly outstanding,"Tons of great illustrations, includes many Black Flag flyers and a few album covers. 2 great interviews with Pettibon; he reveals a lot while remaining distant, if that makes sense. There's a handful of essays on his work and texts of scripts from ""unrealized video."" I found ""Psychedlic Translation of Allen Ginsberg's Howl"" particularly tedious, but that's a minor complaint. If you want to know more about Pettibon this is a great place to start."
1,phone rest,"Product was opened when I received it, plus it was missing pieces and was unable to use. I feel that the sender knew this was opened, and sold it to me knowing it was defective. In the future, I will probably not purchase items from Amazon.com if this is the way in which purchases are handled."
5,LOS GRANDES EXITOS DE MILLIE!,"En este disco ""Mis mejores exitos"" podras encontrar maravillosos temas de Millie, una de las mejores voces de la musica latina. ""Una voz en el alma"", ""De hoy en adelante"", ""Me equivoque"", ""Sola"", ""Con los brazos abiertos"" y ""Emociones"" son algunos de los grandes exitos de Millie que componen este disco. Ademas podras encontrar el mega-hit de Millie a duo con Alvaro Torres titulado ""Estaremos Juntos"". Pero sin duda lo mejor que tiene este CD son las nuevas versiones rancheras de los temas ""De hoy en adelante"" y ""Llora por el"". Si te gustan las baladas tienes que tener este disco...Millie es unica! Tambien recomiendo los siguientes CD's: ""Pasional"" de Jessica Cristina, ""Jerry Rivera"" de Jerry Rivera y ""Dulce Veneno"" de Carolina Lao."
5,Fabulous,"My sister sent me a Del Way CD for my birthday. She belongs to a club and didn't think this would be any good, so she sent it to me. She was SO wrong. ""The Only Way"" by Del way was great. I ordered ""Mercy Came Down"" by Del Way after listening to the first CD. ""Mercy Came Down"" is just as fabulous.Do yourself a favor and order this CD. You will enjoy his songs and their meanings."
3,Funny but short,"Basically a collection of about 10 minutes of GW Bush making a lot of mistakes while speaking. Funny, but way too short."
2,Won't get fooled again.,"This is a collection of malapropisms by George W. Bush set to music. ""Terrorism"" is backed by ""The Star Spangled Banner"". ""Education"" is backed by ""Pomp and Circumstance"". ""The Environment"" is backed by ""America the Beautiful"". ""The Economy"" is backed by ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"". ""Governance & Compassion"" is backed by ""Hail To the Chief"". This is moderately amusing, but very short. It's so short, they repeat all the malapropisms at the end of the cd without the music and it's still only 18 minutes long."
1,"If you paid more than $1 for this, you wasted your money","As much as I don't like G.W., all this CD contains is about 8 minutes of him misspeaking. To make the CD a little longer, they bunched tracks 1-6 and made a track 7 out of it, so you just hear what little you did hear again. I didn't expect much of this CD when I got it as a Christmas gift, but it rated well below those meager expectations. Don't even buy this as a ""white-elephant"" gift."
1,GEORGE W. BUSH GOT A CD!!!....YOU GOTTA BE FU*KIN KIDDING ME!!!...HA HA HA HA HA!!!,"I JUST CANT HELP IT, HAD TO SAY IT ONE MORE TIME,ONE WORD FOR THIS MAN HE SUCK'S HA HA HA HA HAHA HAHA UH WOOO HA HA...A JACKAZZ FOR A COMMANDER AND CHIEF!!!"
5,The Legend Of Walks Far Woman: An Untamed Woman in a Savage Land,This western movie is a great find especially when it has Raquel Welch in it she is great in her role .
3,Inaccurate Description,"Maybe it's me, but my understanding of the description was that this battery is made by AT&T/LUCENT. It is not. It is a replacement made by EMPIRE. Only time will tell if they are equal to the OEM. They work, and the price is good, but I think the description is misleading."
1,Battery Review,I purchased a new battery for my AT&T phone. This is an older model and is difficult to find. I replaced the battery when I received it and it didn't charge at all. I switched it to another phone and again it would only last 5 seconds and die. I decided to retire my old AT&T phones and go with a new system.
2,Buy the Name Brand!,The seller may say this battery an AT&T battery but it did not hold a charge anywhere near the original. I would have been better off by paying more and receiving an authentic AT&T battery
4,"product good, shipping cost high",the batteries work great. i ordered 3 batteries that were shipped in one postal service package and the cost to ship was almost as much as the batteries.
2,Too much Rich,"I bought the album after hearing ""Out of Nothing"" and ""Cant Hold Back"". I believed that the rest of the album would be more of the same chilled type of lounging music. Later on, I found out that there are tracks where Rich Medina monotonously talks ...and talks entirely too much. It's a real moodkiller. Then you have a couple of useless filler tracks to bypass. There are a few ""Richless"" R&B tracks that were okay and a sprinkle of interludes with nice grooves. ""Blues Baby"" is a hip hop track that starts off with Rich droaning. I only knew that Blues Baby gets better when I didn't bother to advance to the next song one day and left it playing. Connecting the Dots is not a bad CD, but can't help but to think that I got ahold to a DJ's experimental throwaway."
4,Beautifully written and pensive.,"Sad and hopeful at the same time, but refreshingly lacking in self pity by the narrorator. My only wish is for more."
5,"Evan Marshall, you've done it again...A GReeeeat Book!","Evan Marshall: I just had to let you know again, I bought your first book 16-step program to write a novel, and am very happy to say I've enjoyed it again. Your Workbook Plan was a great follow-up to your first novel writing book...I only wish you would come out with a followup software program...I would be the first one to buy it. Please keep up writing these how-to wonders...and thanks again....I bought Storycraft software and I'm sad to say I got caught with a worthless piece of software ..SAVE YOUR MONEY, and buy Evan Marshall's 2 writing books."
3,OK way to structure your fiction writing project,Getting long in the tooth (the book and me both) but it's a way to approach writing a novel. It's a workbook with lists. Don't rush into it but don't ignore it.
3,Would have had 5 stars if it weren't for the ridiculous shipping charges!!!!!,These seem to be the one mint that really settles my stomach so I splurged. But I will look elsewhere from now on! $15 for shipping is absolutely ridiculous!!!!!!!! When you can ship so cheaply these days with flat-rate shipping there is no reason for this!
3,Lovely peppermint sticks but broken...,"I was so excited to see these offered on Amazon. I searched all over for them last Christmas. The tin is very nice and the sticks are nicely made and taste great. However, half of them were broken. I was using them for a party and wanted stirrers for hot cocoa. I have just about enough for the party but was disappointed that the others were in pieces. I am not sure if I will order these again."
3,Soft Peppermint Stix,This food product was just okay. They reminded me of those mints you get in diners at the cashier's register only with less pee handled stains on them. I'm not sure if I would ever order these again in the future. Good luck!
3,No belt clip,"It has a belt sleeve not a clip as stated. While others maybe happy with their purchase it does not remedy the fact that the product is improperly described. Other than that the product is fine, I just don't use it because I wanted one with a clip not a sleeve."
3,Belt Clip I think not,It fits the GPS well and protects it pretty good. But the belt loop instead of the clip is a let down. Most of the time I'm in motocross gear and don't have a belt. It would be nice to clip it somewhere. Oh well live and learn.
2,Better Products Available,This is kinda cheap. The case has very little padding. It's too large for the Explorist GPS. Batteries fall out of the interior pouch at times. ...not belt clip.There are much better products available at this price.
4,Good movie,Everyone finds it realistic. Interesting to watch and consider what could happen to our world. What else can I say?
3,great for what it is.,I am not a fan of end of the world type movies. But if you like them you will like this preview. If you have children please make sure you tell them it only a movie.
1,Wasn't what I expected,"I'm new to the whole watching ""trailers"" on Amazon. I was under the impression it was a movie. It didn't hold my interest."
2,A radar dectector worthy of its cost.,"The Silver Bullet is by no means your ""Ultra-Reliable"" detector. It's produced with pretty low-quality materials, gives a lot of false alarms, and misses a lot of signals. For the record, it DOES do its job %60 percent of the time out of the box, but don't let that fool you. The Silver Bullet slowly degenerated in terms of radar detecting accuracy, almost to a point where it would only pick up lasers when driving past an airport. It served me well for maybe 5-6 close calls, but failed me on one that will make sure I never go back to the Silver Bullet ever.If you can only afford this Radar Detector, you probably shouldn't be speeding at all. Invest into a reliable brand such as Escort or Valentine, and get what you paid for."
4,Nice,"Very nice little charm. The size is a little deceiving from the picture though. It is definitely smaller than what you see there, so be aware. Also, like most of this kind of stuff, it is only meant to be viewed from one side. The backside is plain plain plain."
3,We all make mistakes,"In this case, the author got paid handsomely for his mistakes, and I paid for mine. I should have read the reader reviews before buying! I love reading Leonard, especially his Detroit stuff, but this was just over the top.Oh well, when's his next one coming out?"
2,wow from star trek to this!,I didn't know the guy who played Dr. Spock was also a novelist. But he needs to quit dwelling on his role from Lost In Space and write a less sophmoric read...
2,"First time Elmore Reader, dissapointed","I was very dissapointed with this book. His writing is at times confusing, especially his use of short sentences that seem out of place. His slang is off, and at times almost comical when he is portraying ""black"" slang. The story never really picked up, and never really climaxed.Interesting characters, but no real storyline here."
1,Even a master can produce a DUD!!!,"A very weak entry from a guy who has been terrific for over 30 years. No interesting characters and weakly plotted.I live in Detroit area, as does Leonard, and felt the Detroit references forced and strained which surprises but the whole enterprise is rather stale.For vintage Leonard set in Detroit the following can be highly recommended:Swag,City Primeval,Unknown Man No.89andFifty-Two Pickup.Every short story in the superb collection,When The Women Came Out To Dance , is superior to Mr.Paradise ."
2,Paradise Lost,"Elmore Leonard's usual deft touch is missing from ""Mr. Paradise"". While the characters are familiar and the dialog reminiscent of his other work, the novel feels more like a collection of scenes than a cohesive work. The story meanders along, then seems to lose its way and eventually comes to a flat conclusion.As is customary in Leonard's work, ""Mr. Paradise"" entwines the lives of various mismatched characters, adds some hidden agendas, some dumb moves and lets the plot unfold. In this case, the formula produces something more like an episode of ""Cops"" with unrelated events, people who come-and-go and a wish for more answers.More than once I could not suspend my disbelief, asking myself ""why doesn't he (or she) just...?"". The purpose and relationship of several characters eluded me often. And I still don't know what the ""chainsaw"" subplot was for.Mr. Leonard has written many superior crime and caper novels. This time he lost his touch."
5,An Entertaining Novel,"What do these reviewers expect? This is the story.A high-end former Detroit call girl, asks her lingerie model roommate to help her entertain a wealthy octogenarian trial lawyer. By entertain, read she dons a cheerleader's skimpy skirt, but goes topless, while performing pom-pom routines beside a TV set while the lawyer watches videotaped University of Michigan football games.The plot, to say the least, is imaginative. The characters are unique and unforgettable. The dialogue is snappy and realistic. The story moves and is entertaining.What did these reviewers expect - a Detroit-based Hamlet? Elmore Leonard is a gifted novelist and Mr. Paradise will add to his reputation as a skilled character crafter."
4,"Dan Brown, eh?","A previous poster mentioned that he didn't get why Leonard is the master of dialogue. He then went on to say he was partial to Dan Brown. If someone says that they prefer the bestselling author of the month (be it Grisham, Brown, etc) that sends up a red flag in my brain immediately. I know not to trust his review or taste. Elmore Leonard IS the greatest writer of dialogue working today. He has the simplest writing style because he just lets characters actions and words speak for themselves. He takes out everything you would normally skip over when reading a book (flowery descriptive paragraphs, etc) and just leaves what we want (dialogue and action). This makes him the easiest read imaginable. Of course, that is, if you like your novels dark, twisted and hilarious. If the last book you read was The Firm or The Da Vinci Code, look elsewhere my shallow, unadventurous friend."
4,Another good one for Elmore Leonard fans,"With Elmore Leonard, you usually know what you are going to get. Leonard's trademark is crisp and witty dialogue, unusual characters, and a plot that reveals itself in surprising ways. This book is no exception. It is not one of his most intriguing works - I found the storyline a little more predictable than normal for Leonard - but it is still a very worthwhile read.If you are an Elmore Leonard fan, you will enjoy this book. If you have never read Leonard's work, I would recommend starting with Get Shorty, Rum Punch, or Pagan Babies first and come back to this one."
3,Can't Win 'Em All,"Much as I wanted to love this book,it would be a disservice to Leonard to give it more than a ""3"". He's great and this one isn't. Where's the twist? Where's the ""omigod"" everything-falls-into-place ending? And yeah, what's Kelly's real agenda?? And why is Frank so stupid over her?? And why did Montez Taylor spend ten years thinking maybe he might get some money from a guy like Paridiso?? None of it makes sense, not even ""oh he thought that, so she thought that, so thats why..."" Leonard sense!"
4,Quite devious,Leonard knows precisely how to sketch the human frailties of his characters. Jack Ryan is the process-server so good at finding people that he's approached by some shady businessmen to locate a woman with a ruinous drinking problem. What's at stake is the money and maybe a chance for something that can pass for love.
3,I'm still waiting for the book to deliver,"Mr. Paradise never really hits a high note. The plot is unexceptional and the characters, while interesting enough by any other author's standards, fall short of expectation for an Elmore Leonard novel. There's no suspense in the story at all, and that's probably the biggest disappointment.The Amazon.com review notes that the budding romance between the witness and the detective characters removes any element of suspense that could have attached to her character, and the same holds true for the contents of the safe deposit box, which is the McGuffin of the book. There was a chance to blow the reader away with the reveal of the McGuffin, but ultimately, it ended up being just what everyone thought it was going to be.The dialogue is typically tight and hard boiled. Leonard is a master at capturing the feeling of authenticity by writing the dialogue of lowlifes and cops just right. Unfortunately, that's probably the only highlight to the book."
4,"Not bad, not bad at all","No, this may not be Mr. Leonard's best effort to date, bu this book is still pretty darn good. Let's face it, something that is less than his best is still better than 99% of the other garbage that is out there to read. While I would not recommend this title to someone that wants to enjoy their first Elmore Leonard novel (Get Shorty gets that role), I would definitely recommend this to any fan of Leonard or a fan of the genre. Enjoy."
3,Wait for the paperback,"Elmore Leonard's characters and plot lines are often a bit wierd and in this latest effort, wierdness rules. A contract murder by a couple of bungling hit men sets in motion a whole scenario of sub plots which are mildly entertaining, but never compelling.If you are an EL fan, wait for the summer and buy it in paperback for a beach read."
2,Yawn...,"This novel is, at best, mediocre. I kept having the feeling that Mr. Leonard was just cranking it out to satisfy a contract obligation. He spends more effort playing with verb tense than on character development. The result is a clumsy read about some basically one-dimensional people. The plot is just silly. The whole has the general characteristics of an Elmore Leonard book, but it seems a half-hearted effort. If you must read it, check the public library. Save your money."
2,I Hate To Say This,"Pound for pound, I think Elmore Leonard is one of the best writers living. He doesn't always write great books, but the reading of them is a joy. That said--this one, I am sorry to say, is a wet fuse. It simply lacks everything I read him for. But after so many good books, even he should be allowed a dud. Don't start with this one."
4,Cool book by one cool author,"Elmore Leonard is, without a doubt, the coolest author around. I love to read his books simply because his writing style is so unique; he isn't one of these robotic authors who follows given guidelines for writing or plotting. His style is crisp and edgy, simply cool.""Mr. Paradise"" offers the usual band of offbeat characters and great dialogue; however, I found the characters' personas somewhat lacking. No real depth, none showing any real emotion. Kelly is too detached -she doesn't even seem to mourn the death of her roommate, I never could get a feel for Delsa, and Montez is conflictual; however, Lloyd was a great character.Still... I love Leonard and will continue to read him. Not one of his best, but still a book I enjoyed."
2,A Disappointing Read,"I've read a number of Elmore Leonard novels, and I would classify myself as a fan. Unfortunately, this novel just doesn't live up to the standard of fine fiction that he has created over the years. While most of Leonard's novels are short, I found myself constantly checking to see how many pages were left in the book, a rarity with his novels. The characters were unlikeable, and the plot twists were convoluted. Pass up on this novel and concentrate on some of his better novels, such as Maximum Bob or Rum Punch."
3,"Brisk, entertaining read but...","...I had to skim and skip over certain parts that just seemed too meandering. As other reviewers have noted, there are simply too many characters in this novel, it's not as tightly focused as it should have been. This is the first Leonard novel I've read, coming off of his excellent book of short stories entitled ""When the women come out to dance.""Already I'm starting to pick up on the ""Elmore Leonard genre""---great dialogue and street smarts, the laconic but smart central character usually wins out over the dumb brutish crooks and often bags the seemingly out-of-his-league hottie in the process, or is reunited with some long-lost childhood flame.I'm waiting to see if there's a Leonard novel where the protagonist is more of a bumbling schmuck anti-hero...LOLStill, a pleasant way to kill a few hours. Would make for perfect reading at the beach or on a plane.3 and 1/2 stars."
3,Probably the best bug book,"A nasty plot twist (the virus, Plainville, possesses a human host, resulting in a virus with intelligence). It is the ultimate expression of what viruses ""set out"" to do--turn hosts into virus. Who cares whether it's even remotely probable? (Retroviruses usually cause chronic diseases like AIDS and lymphoma, not acute, annihilating plagues as in this book.) The characters aren't the most profound, but who's looking for Shakespeare here? I certainly wasn't, and the book gave me several sleepless nights. If you want a technically competent book, read the Coming Plague. The Blood Artists is strictly for fun."
2,"Implausible, logistically flawed, but worth finishing","Curiously, I work at the CDC in Building 6, room 156, which would put me directly across from the room the two good (?) doctors from this tome inhabit. Not surprisingly, the resemblance between the two buildings is marginal.Although there are plot twists aplenty, and even given likely technological advances between now and the future setting for this novel, most of the scientific underpinnings for this book are implausible. Viewed in the context of science (or speculative) fiction, the book semi-succeeds. As a heads-up for future dire bioterroristic possibilities, it fails. Miserably.The characters are poorly developed, there are plot disconnects everywhere (e.g., even on-command military transport could not get these people where they were supposed to go in the timeframes noted).I really hoped for a lot more from this book. For a much more persuasive read, try The Eleventh Plague, by John S. Marr."
2,BOOORing!!,"What a waste of time; I am glad I checked this out at the library rather thasn buying it. The characters are cardboard...never feel that you know about them or care what happens to them. I like good science fiction and good medical suspense thrillers, but this wasn't one of them. A ""human virus""....please!!"
1,what a waste of reading time,Horrible. Just plain horrible. A little hard to follow. No characters that I really cared about. Hyper unrealistic actions and motives. It was a waste of my precious and limited reading time.
3,Skimmed more than read,"If a book is truly awful, I put it down immediately. That wasn't the case here, but after about fifty pages in, it just didn't compel me to invest much of my self into really reading it. So, having gotten 50 pages in, I start speed/reading and skimming and it's usually for the best.That was the case with Blood Artists. At first, it seemed Crichton-esque, but the characters were merely well-described, not well-fleshed out. Things move so quickly, you never get in bed with these characters and then you're at the end which is fairly absurd. Had I not skimmed through it, I would have been far more disappointed.Great dust jacket, though!"
5,scholerely and reliable,"A detailed review of the available evidence on the link between dietary cholesterol and health quoting more than 2000 references. The position of the book is that dietary cholesterol and saturated fat is only very weakly associated with coronary artery disease and that lowering cholesterol has no consistently observed effect on life expectancy. This may be because certain other illnesses including some cancers appear more commonly in persons with low cholesterol and polyunsaturated fats. This position is cogently and convincingly argued. I would strongly recommend ""Cholesterol Conspiracy"" to anyone interested in the subject. The book is aimed at a non medical audience and is a summary of the authors longer and even more heavily referenced two volume ""critical review"" of the subject which is aimed at professionals working in the field."
4,"Really pretty, but fell out!!","This ring looks REALLYYYY pretty on, but one day I got home from dinner and it wasn't there! I had trouble with the top ball staying screwed in before, so I guess this time I just went too long without tightening it. So sad :( but like I said, it's a really cute piece of jewelry!"
1,wow and flutter a major problem,"Music is distorted because of speed variation! The batteries had full charge so this was not the problem. The tapes were good quality. The pinch roller seemed to have enough pressure against the capistan. I hate to complain or ask for a refund, but this is a bad product-something I did not expect from a Sony product. It is good on voice and will record so I will keep it. Next time I will pay more to get a better product!"
3,Bear's Toy,liked quality...but poorly constructed. U will need to reinforce the seams.....it is his fav toy...washes well. Bettersuited for small breed.
3,"I was expecting more, what happens after NDEs?","On Life After Death is a wonderful book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have an NDE myself? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, just one chapter about her great NDE, but the rest of it shows how anyone can open up, if they learn how. I'm not saying ON LIFE is a bad book, really, but I guess I was just expecting more."
4,Fast reading with no nonsense...,This book is best described as the Generic book on Life After death. It cuts out the details of -if death happened like this then you will be recieved like that. It is the basis the foundation for all the other books on this topic. It would be a good book to start out with if you are just beginning to read on this subject or it would be a good in-betweener to absorb other things you have read previously.
5,On Life and Dearh,Elisabeth Kubler-Ross is world renowned for all her books. Provides so much information on this subject.
2,"Close, But No Cigar","In this extremely brief book consisting of four separate essays, Kubler-Ross talks about her meeting with a deceased person (this almost made me put the book down thinking that she was nuts! ), the process of grieving over parents, personal growth and her own mystical experience and near death experience. The book is interesting, but suffers from an extreme bias. It is not dispassionate at all and she seems to wish to push her opinions on others. She claims to have collected over 20,000 NDE reports, but all of her evidence is anecdotal and cannot be backed up. Still, she insists that ""there is no death"" and uses this as part of her life's philosophy. She may have greater justification than other people for this, but I can't help but thinking that her arguments are a bit weak. The most interesting part of the book was her account of some very odd experiences which she herself had. A nice addition to the literature of near death studies, but I was not much impressed."
5,Certainly a must read for distribution inventory managers.,"Gordon Graham brings his quick wit, and common sense approach to distribution inventory. His book gives the reader a wide variety of approach methods, formulas, procedures, and thought process for use in distribution inventory. Even the most experienced inventory manager would be irresponsible by ignoring this work. With Graham's casual matter of fact manner, and obvious self confidence in inventory practices that have proven themselves time and again the reader is quickly exposed to at least one method of approach to serving the customer, and the bottom line with equal respect and care."
3,Handles too skinny!,The handles tend to twist if you are using for anything besides a soft cheese or spread.
5,Cute,"I have the Gourmet Settings Silver Tear silverware set, so when I saw the matching mini spreaders, mini forks, and mini spoons I had to have them! I've had them for a couple years now and they're heavy duty; none of my silverware has bent out of shape. Overall, great buy!"
5,An Intriguing Journey with a Most Versatile Artist,"Melanie Fisher's definitive presentation of paintings and drawings is well written and amasses for the first time an authoritative collection of the works of Bela Kadar. Bela Kadar's art is delightfully challenging spanning the most important art trends of the 1920s and 1930s. Fisher's discussion of this artist's rendition of Hungarian peasant life is sensitive and charming, yet presents a scholarly review that is most intellectual gratifying."
1,Can live without it,"Poor translation from German, poor content. This is the worst of my aquarium books. I cannot imagine anybody who could consider this book helpful or interesting. Such a pitty! The same author wrote one of the best books: ""How to have a successful aquarium""."
1,DO NOT PLACE AN ORDER FOR THIS ONE,"UNIFORM CAME FROM CENTURY MARTIAL ART SUPPLY AND IT'S 1/2 THE SIZE OF THE ALL THE CHARTS I'VE SEEN. AFTER WASHING IT, I'M LOOKING AT THE STRONG POSSIBILITY OF IT GOING STRAIGHT IN THE TRASH . . . I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL SHRINK. SAD FACE!!!P.S. - I ONLY RATED IT 'ONE STAR' JUST BECAUSE I COULDN'T REGISTER ANYTHING BELOW THAT."
5,Exactly what I expected and early arrival,This seller got the item out to me days before I expected it. The sizing chart is very precise about sizing which made it easy for me to order my son his first Gee. Thank you.
3,"Cheaply made, but pretty much what I expected for the price.","It's hard to find uniforms this small, so I was glad to find this one. That said, the quality was marginal. Nothing to complain about at this price point, but any worse and I'd be looking for another provider."
3,boys Karate uniform,"I'm returning the uniform, because with no information on how to read the sizing, i choose a size too big for my 5 year old grandson. I don't understand why the vendor couldn't anticipate this problem in the first place? What does sizes ""0000 to 8"" mean?WayneWhite Light Weight Karate Uniform Size 0000 to 8"
1,Size Chart is wrong,"Ordered a size 6, which turns out to be for someone about 6'4"" tall... The size chart on their product page is completely wrong.nice quality Gi, shipping took a long time. I am returning it to buy the correct size."
5,The real deal,"Very high quality ""professional"" style karate uniform. Sized perfectly from chart. Grandson loves it and it fits like a dream."
3,"Good experience, just made a personal mistake in size :/","Fast delivery time. Product came in before the originally-predicted delivery date. I wish that there was a more accurate sizing chart on the page for this product, as I ordered a size 5 (which is what I am now), but when it came in, it was extremely too big for me. But, that is really my own fault for not calling and confirming the size detail of a size 5 uniform. Yet, they were easy to work with and ordering was a breeze. Just make sure you check the size by calling (Tiger Claw directly) if you order this particular uniform off of Amazon, because a size chart is not shown with the description of this item and I am sure that Amazon will not know if you call them personally."
3,Very Light weight,"The item was light weight, as described. It just wasn't durable for what our son needed. You can see underwear/jock strap/protective cup through the fabric. Would probably be fine for someone needing light use. As far as the sizing went, it was accurate."
1,Too small! Not true to size.,"I bought this for my son cause the price seemed reasonable, but when I got it, it was really small. Not true to size at all. My son has 2 other karate uniforms size 000, and this one seemed to be made for a 2 year old, not 50 lbs! I gave it to a friend who has a tiny 4 yr old."
1,Check size BEFORE buying,Make SURE you check the sizing BEFORE ordering. I wish I had read the reviews before making my purchase. My son was so disappointed when it arrived and was MUCH too big.
5,Snorkel Maui,"If you are going to Maui and plan to snorkel, this book is a MUST !!!! It will take you to sites you would NEVER find on your own."
2,Incomplete,"I thought this was a good guide to snorkeling on Maui until I got to Maui and my brother had ""Maui Revealed."" Maui Revealed is a guidebook that is not limited to snorkeling, but surprisingly, its coverage of snorkeling sites is much more complete than Snorkel Maui. For instance, at La Perouse Bay, there are many coves that are wonderful that can only be reached by hiking. Snorkel Maui won't get you there. Maui Revealed will. I would pass on this book."
5,A must for snorkeling Hawaii,"However general guides may be, they are not a substitude for a guide written for snorkelers only.We find this book amust for snorkeling Maui, it is loaded with information targeted for snorkelers. It has invaluable maps and provides information about each site, such as how to get to, what to expect, water currents, weather and very detailed directions. We found the information to be very accurate.Using this guide, my wife and I became adicted to snorkeling and were able to enjoy 1 hour plus snorkels twice a day for a week enjoying the beautiful and diverse underwater life safely.Thanks to the Malinowski's for this great guide!"
2,Not found yet,"When the writer of a book on the greatest sporting celebrity since Muhammed Ali is a bit of a celebrity himself, there's a clash of egos. The problem with this book is that Tom Callahan, author of In Search of Tiger does not find Tiger Woods at all. Tom finds Tiger's father and a tiny part of his mother, and he does find other players (quite a lot of them) but this book reveals little about Woods himself. There is no question that Tom Callahan is an excellent writer who knows the sports industry intimately. Anyone who loves the sport of golf will probably enjoy this book. It is an easy and worthwhile read. But for anyone looking to reveal the mystique behind Tiger Woods, this book dissapoints."
5,Fantastic! A golf writing double-eagle**,"Let me say this up front --- Tom Callahan is an immensely gifted writer. He is able through words to take the trite/boring and turn it into the phenomenally sublime. With an encyclopedic knowlege of all things golf along with up-close-and-personal profiles of current & past players, coaches, and associated fathers, he paints through annecdotes a circular, but no less complete picture of Tiger and his place in the great game of golf. This book is NOT per-se, a purely biographical sketch of Tiger Woods, but more of a wholistic and entertaining presentation of the past, present and future of the game and Tiger's place in it. If you love golf, watch golf, and love to read, you'll get more ""bang for your buck"" here than any other golf book I know of! And I've read quite a few...."
5,What an adventure!!!,"This story is made for the movies. If Disney doesn't get Harrison Ford for the male lead they're missing the boat. (No pun intended.) I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Read it at one setting, finally putting it down at two in the morning. The next book (previewed at the end) sounds equally good."
4,Suspenseful!,"Doctors Sarah and Michael Stone, along with their young daughter Ronnie, seem to have a pretty ideal life. They sail around the Pacific treating patients all over the islands. Just as they are about to pull into a remote atoll to see if anybody needs help, they get a call from a giant carrier ship nearby: it's captain has been seriously injured and needs urgent medical care. So, Sarah and Ronnie drop off Michael to check out the atoll and continue alone to the ship. The next thing they know, their boat has been hoisted up and they've been kidnapped. Michael has to figure out how to save them before it's too late! Pretty exciting plot, though it got a little slow in places."
3,tedious and uncanny good fortune for each peril encountered,"The review of Paul Garrison's new book, Fire and Ice, intrigued me so I purchased it. However, although the plot developed rapidly, the reader was required early on to endure an abundance of technical sailing jargon/maneuvers to bridge to the more meaningful parts of the plot. The miraculous ability of the lead character to overcome all obstacles in his path, including natural phenomenon, was very unrealistic and annoying to this reader to the point of sometimes being even ludicrous.The book was mediocre reading with a lot of potential action to play on, but I found the plot underdeveloped, incomplete, and some very unbelievable solutions to, and some very 'casual' escapes from some BIG problems."
3,"Good, but flawed","Good idea, but the track selection could have been better. There are many more true country covers that could/should have been used, instead of several of these tracks that are bluegrass or folk rather than country. Dave Dudley, George Hamilton IV, Ray Stevens, Jerry Reed, The Browns, John Anderson, Statler Brothers come to mind. I was also surprised to see the re-use of Restless Farewell from A Nod To Bob, another Dylan tribute from just a couple of years ago.FYI: Nashville Skyline Rag is Earl Scruggs with Bob Dylan, and Heartland is the Willie Nelson & Bob Dylan duet. Bob also plays harmonica on Boots of Spanish Leather."
3,OK Dylan covers,"AMG had a fairly glowing review of this CD, so I checked out a copy from our public library network to give it a listen. Although it's a pleasant enough collection of Dylan songs - and with a few real highlights - Jerry Jeff Walker's take on ""One Too Many Mornings"" for example, I don't think the CD as a whole warrants serious praise.A few of these covers I have elsewhere in my collection, not to mention some of the Dylan versions, so there's no need for me to pursue this further right now. Still, if I see this at a bargain price, say under $5, I might scoop it up."
3,Greatest Dylan cover?,"It may not be pure country, but for my money the greatest Dylan cover ever is Jason and The Nashville Scorchers blistering rendition of ""Absolutely Sweet Marie"". To me, in a great cover the artist retains the feel of the original while making the song his own at the same time. JaTNS accomplished that in spades. It may not have fit here perfectly, but it would definitely have juiced up the proceedings.The stuff here is very nice for the most part, and worth a listen."
4,"So far, so good","I've had this item a couple of months. I put my camera gear in it and took it to the beach. It seemed to be watertight and sand-tight as advertised. I'm not sure I trust the advertising claims, but it seems worth the cost.I had trouble getting the sizing right from the manufacturer's website, but that could have been me.My wife says it kept me from having to carry a man-purse."
2,Case not as originally described,"I bought this as a replacement for a case I had lost. The original picture showed a case with a strap not a carabiner. Not only was the strap missing replaced with a cheap carabiner, but the rubber insert is thicker and my camera no longer fits inside. Neither problem is insurmountable but it was disappointing that the information on Amazon advertised products cannot be trusted. Buyer, BEWARE!"
5,Perfect fit for Panasonic DMC-ZS3,"I am extremely satisfied with a tip I recently saw under another customer's product picture: The Pelican 1010-026-100 Micro Case fits the Panasonic DMC-ZS3 camera just perfectly!Because of another review, I was a bit worried about the clear lid, which doesn't have extra protection inside, but the camera is very snug and secure in the case, it doesn't wiggle at all.Now I am looking forward to my next air travel, when the camera is clearly visible for security personnel at the checkpoint, because overseas I often had to remove my cameras from their bags. This case should speed up the check-through significantly!"
4,Just the right size,"I wanted something that I could throw my wallet phone and keys as well as the other daily pocket items in, and then beable to throw in a day pack. For when I get on a boat or step into the woods and not worry about those items this box is the right size, water proof and tough. Just what I was looking for."
4,Looks solid,The yellow foam inside did not fit very well. I have not tried it yet so do not know if it is OK.
4,"The Princess, the Crone, and the Dung-Cart Knight","Although this is only the second of the series that I have read (the other being Parsifal's Page) I thoroughly enjoyed it. Unlike some authors he manages to stay relatively true to the arthurian tales and yet adds his own style. I certainly enjoyed the humor that was rampant throughout the books. It is not necessary to read the others in the series, although helpful. If you haven't however, a small knowledge of the basic stories is sufficient. This is certainly one of the best (and few successful) rewrites that I've ever read."
3,"Good Reading, But Incomplete Documentary","Most of the reading was interesting, but the transcript itself was incomplete. However, this book did shed light on a number of unanswered questions.I did feel, during much of the reading, that the right questions were not asked by both Senator Smith and Lord Mersey from the Brittish inquiry.However, I feel that this is still a worthwhile book to read."
5,"Boring title, BUT a very exciting book!","This book has a long and boring title, but don't let it frighten you, it will get exciting, as the senator pulls the vitnesses stories apart. The crew covered eachother, especially when the passengers (problably) tells the truth. It also has some humoristic parts, like the wireless operators testemony, the senator doesn't know a thing about wireless communications, and his questions are quite stupid."
3,Should have been more,There should of been more witnesses in the book. I would of been whiling to pay more for it.
4,fanatastic,will definetly be doing business again with this company. books arrived on time (before expected date) and in the promised condition. i recommend people tp do business with this company.
5,excellent,"this is a fantastic book, and i hear the book on tape hired 25 actors to play the parts. a historical docudrama in its purest sense."
2,Don't be fooled,I look at all anime and martial arts all three of these movies made add up to a good movie separately. The only good movie was blood of the dragon and the ending of that was not good. And the okay one was 36 crazy fists.
3,AT&T head set,"A good product for the money, but find it slides off my head too often and its set as tight as i can get it. Have to be careful not to move head much. Sound is clear.Was sent next day by Overstock, but sat in next place for 5 days before fianlly sent to me!"
3,Worth the 3 bucks,It feels at little cheaply made but it only cost 2.88 so if it only lasts 6 months I'll feel like it was worth it.
3,Bigger than Nomal,"The only issue I have with the product, I cant plug it in the phone outlet, its actually bigger than the outlet for some reason. Maybe I missunderstood the 4line connectiong meaning is bigger???I think this is a Network splitter, since its bigger and NOT a phone outlet splitter"
1,phone cord adapters,The discription of this item was not clear. I needed adapter for three phones in one room. It said it was a four line outlet adapter but would not fit in the phone wall jack and had only two cord outlests. I had to purchase another adapter.
3,"Readable, But Forgettable","This novel covers the last days of Ulysses S. Grant, interspersed with Grant's ""flashbacks"" to the Civil War. The author relies too heavily on exposition to tell his story (one chapter where Grant and his wife tell each other virtually his whole life story is particularly awkward,) and the ending somehow manages to be both flat and overly melodramatic. However, parts of the book (particularly the depiction of Shiloh) are genuinely moving. This is hardly a memorable novel--I doubt I'll read it twice--but it is not a complete waste of time, either."
5,Ideal Replacement,We use the accompanying Floormate cleaner on our mats. The repleacement is superior to the included one.Visit [...] to see the r
2,not an original Hoover filter,"Even though the picture and description said Hoover FloorMate filter, it is not the Hoover brand.The rubber gasket was too large for the door that encloses it to shut properly, so I had to make repeatedattempts at trimming it. I haven't used it yet, but after reading some of the other reviews I hope I haven'twasted my money on an inferior product. Next time, I'll check out Lowes or Home Depot."
3,Will do for a generic,"Item was shipped same day from VacuumSupplyStore and USPS delivered very fast. The fit is looser than the original one. I though I was getting a real Hoover filter. Hah! Will have to do for now. By the way, it is not meant to filter the dirty return water in wet mode. It is for filtering the air."
4,Fast service,"The filter arrived very fast. It was larger then the original & I had to maneuver it in. I'm not sure if it was an original part or an after market part. I works just the same, so I'm pleased enough."
4,it works,it does the job is supposed to do. it didn't right in my floormate but still works.it makes the filter cover a little tough to put back on after you install it but it works
5,Good filter at a good price,"Not much to say - this filter is just what it says it is, I find it to be good quality, and is an excellent price considering it includes shipping."
1,had to return the floor mate and filter,I didn't like the Hoover floor mate and so the filter went back also. The whole unit was too heavy and unmanueverable.
5,Hoover Floormate Filter,"Purchased the filter as a replacement to the original filter, it fit perfect and is still working well after ""several"" uses. Many stores did not carry the filter locally, therefore finding it on Amazon was convenient and quick."
2,Filter for Hoover Floormate,It is not as good as the actual one from the company. The material that is filtering the water through does not filter correctly and lets too much water go through it. I'm sure it's the material is not as absorbent and therefore does not trap the dirt and water like it should. I don't think I'll buy this next time but get one directly from Hoover or is certified Hoover product. This is a generic.
1,Poor quality aftermarkete knockoff,"I read some reviews about getting a generic item, so I purchased it directly from Amazon.com, not a 3rd party seller. Well, the item I got was still some no-name brand..but I figured that it's worth a shot. The first issue was that the fit wasn't quite right, but some squeezing fixed that.The main problem is that the filter membrane material must be inferior. I noticed that the suction was terrible with this filter - worse than a dirty OEM one, so I ended up just buying a brand name one locally. What a difference! Upon further inspection, it's clear that the OEM one's filter material looks ""orderly"" with this one has fibers that look rather randomly woven. Also, this filter takes much longer to dry, leading me to believe that it may have some paper content vs. fiberglass or whatever the real one is made out of."
4,Very Nice Product,I have been a Corel user for years. This latest version is a great improvement. Esp for Raster to Vector tracing. I have always preferred to use Corel over our Illustrator even though I have both installed on my system. Corel just seems to be a much more user friendly program. Very powerful for anyone from Novice to Pro user.
5,"Been using Draw! for 15 years, Best ever.","Excellent program, good price, they keep making it better. I started with version 3 so 10 versions higher this one is makes it super."
3,Just Getting Started,"I am currently taking an online class on the use of CorelDraw suite x3 through a Vocational Rehabilitation program...just started a week ago. However, I am finding the product very much to my liking."
2,"unless you're a software guru, forget this program","I'm in awe about what this program can do, but I've yet to be able to use it to its fullest. It's not user friendly and I've been designing photo brochures, and marketing literature and multi-media presentations for years with other design software.The Corel_Tutor is unwieldy to use and only illustrates the simplest projects. It takes a week to learn the glossary used for the program. And if you don't use it daily, it's easy to forget the glossary and toolbox icons.I was hoping the ""student & teacher"" edition would be more instructive, but it's not.I'm currently searching for a tutor who will teach me the complexities of using this program with a hands-on approach."
1,Sooo not worth it,"I purchased this for my three year old. It is not durable at all, there are no handles to carry it from room to room and it is constantly falling a part. I do not recommend this at all. Toy people do not come with this either. Something I learned a day before Christmas as I was putting it together. Save your money...buy something else."
3,One Dimensional,This is a good film if you want to see Stokely Carmichael (Kwame Torre)and hear his views on African American plight of that era. There are some other civil rights activists covered but not as much.
2,"interesting, but not practice-able","Like the level 1 book, this presents some interesting information, but not in a format that you could actual do the practices. Perhaps this would be of value to people who had taken courses in this tradition, otherwise I did not find it of practical value."
2,"Nice introduction, if you know nothing about diagrams","I just read it. Nice introduction on the subject. If you know nothing about diagraming techniques, it will serve you well. If you know how to embed syntax in a diagram (or have an inkling on how to do it), this book is not for you."
2,Good diagrams for business discussions,"I was searching for a good framework for problem solving and decided to get this book. Content-wise the author has much to cover with 14 core diagrams. He has categorised all this 14 diagrams under several business themes such as: Managing Change, Control, Relationships, Managing Flow etc etc.I really like the Influence Diagram as it provides a fresh perspective to a Strategic Project I handled before.However the publisher seems to like really long paragraphs with little spacing. The published date is 2000 but I feel this style of writing was more to early 1800s where TV has yet to be invented.Hope the author would try to upgrade and review the content with perhaps a different publisher. There is another similiar book of this nature which is the ""The Thinker's Toolkit"". Happy Diagramming."
1,Terrible,"I got these for my infant daughter, she started playing with them in the tub, and I noticed tiny little plastic pieces suddenly floating all over the place! The paint started coming off and there was plastic EVERYWHERE. Terrible product and not at all safe for children!"
5,Love these!,I searched everywhere for a bath toy for my daughter. This was perfect!! I haven't had any problems with smell or meldew and it's been 4 months already!!
4,My 14 month daughter loves them,My daughter does not use in the bath. She plays with and chews on them out of the bath. There cute toys and I would recommend them.
3,moss falls right off,so its a piece of tubing that has moss lightly attached to it. when putting it in my tank most of the moss came off and is all over the place. i think the tubing is meant so that you can run water through it. my geckos dont seem to like it. i think i might take it out. i wouldnt buy this product again.
3,capsules are best!,"I made a mistake in ordering these. They are big tablets, I have to cut them and then cut each side again!I usually take capsules. L Lysine is good to keep my fingernails in good condition. I have taken it for years.I will be sure to order caps next time."
5,Great deal,"Great price and large amount. The pills are large but nothing I have trouble with, I take three at a time - all at once!"
2,TOO BIG,COULD NOT GET HUSBAND TO TAKE GIGANTIC PILLS. IT SEEMS AS IF IT GETS HARDER TO SWALLOW THESE ELEPHANTS AND HALVING THEM IS NOT MUCH HELP. BROKE THE PILL CUTTER ON THEM. SELLER GREAT SERVICE GREAT BUT PRODUCT TOO MUCH
2,Particularly difficult to swallow,"I've been taking a gram a day of L-Lysine for years, always in gel cap form until I got these Country Life tablets. I was pleased with amazon's price, especially in the context of the ""Subscribe and Save"" discount, but after receiving and taking them, I'm cancelling my subscription to these horse pills. They may technically be ""coated"", but in my experience they're anything but ""easy-to-swallow"". These tablets are not only very large and long, but they're noticeably heavy on the tongue. I rarely have even the slightest issues with taking large oral meds, but these just aren't doable for me. I'm definitely going back to the gel-cap type."
4,Great product for the price,It worked great though I must say that if I purchased another one I would get the one with the cable and a higher lift rate. I was moving a tree stump with it and the rope would slip. I think that the 3/4 ton capacity is over-stated.
4,Wine Analysis and Production,Clearly and concisely written for the amature wine maker or student of enology who is serious about learning the technical aspects of great wine production.
4,"Wonderful ""dry"" expose of Clinton's ""moistful"" exposed ways!","We definitly get our $40 million worth reading how President Clinton got his ""job"" done. This book could very well become a ""must read"" for every college student in the fields of American history, sociology, physiology, human sexuality, and most importantly, political-deviantology. Starr's book combines the best of The Decline of the Roman Empire and Thomas Pychon's Gravity's Rainbow (where the protagonist becomes sexually aroused as the V2 rockets land in London). In reading this book, it is obvious that Mr. Starr is no Ernest Hemingway...even though he also has reeled-in a monsterous fish in an excruciating amount of time!"
2,Henry Miller it's not.,"""Appealing to a prurient interest,"" yes. Not to mention ""without redeeming political, social, or scientific value"".If clinical, rather than torrid, reporting of sexual encounters is to your taste, by all means download the Starr report from one of the many Internet mirrors available. If you have a paper fetish, go ahead and buy it. In either case, don't expect something that is entirely legalistic or completely pornographic. What you'll find is a bit of both, seemingly blended for maximum dreariness.I have to give the report two stars, rather than one, because I can't believe that the odor of tawdriness that clings to it is the result of anything other than carefully practiced art. But I still don't know whether to laugh, cry, or just pretend not to have read it.With apologies to Justice Potter Stewart, I can't necessarily give a rigid set of criteria that would define a waste of time and effort. But I know it when I see it."
1,Unbelievable sleaze and graphic sex starring Monica Lewinsky,"Opening with a disclaimer that his report is ""not about sex,"" Kenneth Starr then demonstrates that ""sex"" is exactly and solely what this one-sided account of the last few months of his four plus years investigation has finally resulted in. It is so burdened with irrelevant, gratutitous, graphic and salacious descriptions of sexual encounters based solely on Monica Lewinsky's grand jury testimony (under the blanket of full immunity for her past prejury, etc.) that only one conclusion is possible: its purpose is to damage President Clinton. Starr should be ashamed, as should the House of Representatives for putting this material on the Internet where young children could read all of the sexual allegations in graphic detail. So much for Congress's concerns about sex on the Internet. This Dreck was available on so many sites, that blocking it was impossible. Shame!"
1,Not searchable.,Starr should be commended for putting all the sex up front where slow-reading children can find it. Still I think it's better on the web where children can more easily search for dirty words.
1,"A book not about a crime, but the crime itself","Whether or not the allegations contained within this text constitute a crime is debatable. However, the very fact that Grand Jury testimony has been published before the defendant has been afforded his right of due process is indisputable evidence of criminal and unconstitutional activity. If Congress felt it should be lawful to publish such information, it should have written into law long ago. That's what Congress does (theoretically)."
1,Save Your Money For Dilbert,"What a waste of cash when I found out my buddies where reading the entire thing on the web or in their local newspaper for FREE. Not only did I blow a few bucks on it, but the entire thing turns out to be rather boring."
2,I dont think they should have made a book about this,I think that everyone should leave cliton a lone because he admitted that he is wrong and asked for forgiveness. God is the only one who can judge us is God.
1,A pathetic attempt to further a pathetic cause.,"This whole investigation, MILLIONS of Democrat and Republican taxpayer's dollars spent chasing the Republican's dream of revenge on Democrats for past occurences, has been a total waste of time. This book is evidence not of the wrongdoing, or moral corruption, of a president, but rather it is evidence of an overzealous man who was consumed by a hatred that is beyond what would be reasonable for an unbiased person. History will record Clinton as basically good, but flawed man. History will record Starr as biased, obsessed investigator who was intent on ""getting his man"" using any means possible, right or wrong. That is if history remembers Mister Starr at all."
1,"Jackie Collins, Government Ghostwriter?","""The Starr Report,"" produced at a cost of only $40 million, is a stylish, sexy romp -- meaningless fling turns into constitutional crisis! Bubba meets Big Brother... click here to impeach. Thanks, but no cigar."
1,Read much of the report online- should have remained private,"I have read much of this report online - it is dominated by lurid, detailed descriptions of a sexual affair that should have remained private - a private mistake by the President of the United States that would have remained private but for the persistent efforts of his political enemies. There is no evidence of anything criminal except that which was directly related to keeping this private sexual affair secret. In addition, the testimony which may have not been truthful was ruled by the judge in the Paula Jones case to not be significant to that case and the entire case was dismissed as having no legal merit. To impeach the President for attempting to hide this private matter would be an extreme injustice."
5,Can't wait for the sequel!,"Riveting! I have read this book cover-to-cover. Although I found the main character offensive and disgusting and the plot lurid and repetitious, I couldn't look away. I kept turning the pages.If you are looking for a story with a happy ending, don't look here. At the onset, the main character is portrayed as an earnest, caring, worthy man but is later exposed as immoral, dishonest, arrogant, and self-destructive."
5,What a read!,"First of all, this is a very serious and depressing look at a man who I once believed in, trusted, and voted for at the tender age of 18. Second of all, however, it is a brilliant recounting of a strange and fascinating affair. Don't be worried about being able to get through all the ""legalese"" - its a page-turner! A strange and tawdry one, but aren't those the best kind? To be stimulated on such different levels by one document is a disconserting experience, one which makes me think hard about myself and my country.Always a good thing, no?"
1,Jackie Collins did it better,"This belongs with soft-core sleaze a la Jackie Collins. The sad thing is, this trashy tomb cost $40 million to produce, and Jackie Collins writes so much better."
1,Leave Clinton alone!,Please....leave the poor man alone! What he does in his private life (with or without cigars) concerns nobody but those directly involved.
5,"For What It Is, It's Excellent",The 2 previous reviewers who said this was a waste of time to go after Clinton are missing the point. It is assumed that anyone who buys this book is interested in this saga - once you get past that - the books is incredible in its amount of detail.
5,The Truth is Revealed,"This is an unbelievable report. Painstakingly detailed (be sure to read the footnotes) and convincingly written. This is a must read for any citizen concerned with the potentially illegal actions of the First Citizen. Whether one agrees or disagrees with Starr's tactics, one must admit that he presents a compelling case for punishment, if not impeachment."
1,"one-sided, partisan commentary masquerading as objectivism","How can Kenneth Starr dare profit from his investigation? Can he still call himself a lawyer? Is professional conduct dead for all lawyers, be they presidents or independent counsel? Starr's morality is as bad as the man he vilifies."
1,An appellate brief with too many facts,"As an appellate lawyer, I have seen this before - lots of facts to obscure the absence of legal analysis, or supportive precedent. One must remember that the ""statement of facts"" is not a statement of facts at all, since there has been no trial, and no factfinding. This gives a totally wrong impression of the judicial process. Thus, as a ""book"" it has little value. Better to wait until true analysis comes out in book form, with exerpts from what could become known as the ""infamous"" Starr Report."
1,too bad to print,This Starr Report is not worth the paper its print on. It is a very bad sign for the american democracy that this is published. That is Bill's private life! The public and the republicans should respect his private life as long he doing his job alright.
2,Cry Foul: Starr Disseminates Porn,"A deliberate attempt to embarrass the President of the United States, clearly narrated by a party interested in his destruction for political reasons, who incidentally falls short when it comes to romance-novel-quality description. Thankfully, the report makes clear that Ms. Lewinsky saved her dress to incriminate her victim."
1,Buyer beware,"Not what you see in the picture. I thought I was getting a set of slip stones. Note that the title for this item says ""Stones"".... plural. But what I got shipped to me was one single stone 3-1/2x3/4x1/2 inch in size. In looking more carefully at the detailed description, I can see now that it is described this way, but you have to read very carefully to understand that you will receive only one stone.In my option, the price is too high for one small slip stone. I plan to return what I received.I do wish that Amazon had a policy of ensuring that photos provided by the seller accurately reflect the item being sold."
5,Good buy,Needed these filters for an air purifier. Local department store wanted several dollars more. Arrived quickly and worked well. I will be ordering these filters again.
2,Don't fit Holmes air cleaner they say they will,These don't fit the Holmes air cleaner they say they will. You have to just place them on top without the security tab to hold them in place. We're still using them anyway.
1,Product Received does NOT look like the one on Amazon,"I ordered this product which you can clearly see is white. Look closely and you will also see tabs on the side. The product received was black and did not have tabs on the side. It was useless. I paid $4.99 for shipping and doubt it will be refunded. Also, I have to pay for the return shipping. I will not buy anything from Bulkfilter again!"
1,These don't fit the HAP412,"These filters are advertised as fitting the HAP412 air purifier, but they don't have the tabs to hold it in place. As another customer mentioned, you'll have to jimmy something up, possibly with cardboard, to get the proper fit."
2,Where's the Beef?,"Yeah, yeah, Tom's a REAL NICE GUY according to everyone. He's recorded all the big names in modern music in the ""M"" cities. Ok, now...how did he do it? Where'd he place the mics? Sure, he emphasized the low end, but can we have some examples. For a documentary on a recording engineer it sure was light on his actual work. Save for the breakdown on the multi-tracks of ""Layla"", you get nada. As a musician and home-recorder I was hoping to gain some insight. Guess I'll have to stick with my Tape-Op mags and the ""Classic Album"" dvd series."
5,One of my All-Time Favorites.,"I watched this film in an audio engineering class years ago in college. Having grown up with a father who recorded his own music, I fell in love with it immidiately. I've bought several copies for Christmas, birthdays, etc. If you've got a ""chatty dad"" who loves music-buy this for him and put it on. It'll keep him quiet for hours."
5,If you enjoy writing and recording music...,"Here's a person you should know about. Especially if you're recording your own or a clients music using some sort of software in your computer. This guy was even featured in the movie ""Ray"" starring Jamie Fox. Bet you didn't catch it."
5,Tom Dowd gave us the Music....,"Wow! Was I impressed with this gem. A friend sent me an email with just the URL for the Amazon location for this DVD. We are both old musicians and I should have known better. I trusted him and just ordered it. I was blown away by how much I learned, how much Tom understood how to capture the studio moments and just how influential he was. What a wonderfully interesting and entertaining man he is. The film is top quality and they must have known the sound better be perfect to make this film - awesome clips thoughout and all the interviews are so passionate. It is so much about recording business history and advancements. Tom was certainly the man! If you liked the sound Jerry Wexler heard in ""Ray"" you will understand how it happened with Tom behind the boards. He would say, ""I don't care if it is 92 tracks - what does it SOUND like?"" I can't recommend this highly enough. Cheers!"
1,"Wait, there's more!","Everything in the first review, but also...If you put in 2 spaces (text) or more in a row, it will automatically ""fix"" it for you. There is no way to get around that. Since pressing 'tab' does nothing, that means paragraphs are not allowed!And, the script for even a very simple, single page with just a few text and pictures thrown in is 20 lines average. One page was 39 pages in notepad! Visitors to you site without broadband will be waiting a while for your script to load if you use this. This may sound too ridiculous to be true, but it is.If you decide to get this anyway, you'll end of buying another html-editor like me. You can start with a site built somewhere else in most editors, so you won't have to start over at least. But, since you begin with the same html code, it will still be 20+ notepad pages of code per single web page (not single web site)."
5,A great little buddy,"My MIL bought this for my [..]a just over a year ago. He is my son's favorite ""buddy"". It has super soft fur and is just the right size for cuddling and small enough to fit in my son's little backpack. This monkey's even been to the hospital and had bandages when my son had surgery. His face was getting pretty dirty and I was dreading having to wash it, but it was lost and now we're ordering a second one. We miss his little monkey face!I wouldn't say this toy has much educational value beyond being a little friend for my son to ""feed"" and put ""to bed"", but pretend activities do have value indeed.As for durability, all of his strings were intact after a year's use, but we'd never washed him. He is not machine washable.BTW, this is allegedly a chimp with a tail, but it looks like a sweet little monkey to us!"
5,Action Packed,"This book takes the ""Deep Black"" series to a new level not only in action, but also in character development. One of the main characters suffered a rape in the prior book, and some of this one shows how she deals with that along with continuing with her job as a deep black agent. Crossed over with faults in other characters and a nuclear weapon and this is a book that is worth picking up and reading. If you are into the Technothriller style of books, give this series a try. You will not be dissapointed."
3,"Better than some, worse than others","The characters are pretty well developed. The action meanders here and there with episodes that don't seem to make headway as they are over complicated. I thought seriously about putting it aside to read other purchases which offer more interesting content, but decided to see it through. Maybe not a wowing endorsement, but there it is."
5,Written with conviction,"My first immpression of this BOOKLET was; skinny but what the heck read on, and with so few words, I realised that if we lived a thousand years we would not know-it-all. Tom Grudner has expressed in as few words as possible, what we really ought to know about the equipment we depend on so greatly for this frustrating game of golf. After 38 years plus of building golf clubs, I thought I could learn nothing more; wrong! this little book enlightend me into a whole new concept of what and how a golf club should perform. How for many years leading manufacturers have hoodwinked the average buyer into believing, what they are getting is the right equipment for them, when they are not. The 12 myths are not really myths at all, but common sense bits of advise as to what to look for, before buying your next golf equipment.Well done and thank you Mr Grudner, for writing what I should, and would have loved to have written many years ago."
3,12 MYTHS THAT COULD WRECK YOUR GAME,"Although I love Wishon, I read his other books before buying this and it is a capsule of the what is in the larger volumes. I would recommend this to anyone who has yet to read his other books on how the find your best driver, clubs etc."
3,Short and informative,"While informative, if you have read either of his other books (In search for the Perfect Iron or In search for the Perfect Driver) than you have read everything in this little book. This book is just a short outline of the other two. So if you have read either of the other two, don't bother with this one. If you haven't and want a quick read / review of this subject than this should do."
2,WASTE OF MORE MONEY!,I got this as a gift along with the other reggae cd with Dyulan's music. I wish I didn't buy this one too. THIS CD IS ONE OF THE WORST I HAVE EVER HEARD! Save your money and buy a Bob Marley CD or something like that. This is a joke.
1,Pretty terrible CD,The reason the music industry is suffering. Releasing junk like this.They won't let me return it.
2,'Paint It Black - Reggae Tribute To The Rolling Stones' (Madacy Records) Various Artists - 2 1/2 stars,"Have gotten a bit tired of seeing so many tribute CD releases flooding the market these days, but I thought this reggae tribute to Mick, Keith and the boys wasn't bad. Tunes here I thought showed the most effort was Toots & The Maytal's ""Start Me Up"", Sugar Black's ""Jumping Jack Flash"", The Heptone's ""Satisfaction"" and the Andrew Francis homage of ""Under My Thumb"". Strictly for die-hards."
1,Reggae tribute NOT!,I can't believe that someone would charge money for this.Paint it Black is going back.
5,Smooth and Sexy,"I highly recommend 'Duboc' to lovers of smooth, sophisticated and sexy female jazz vocalists. Carol's range is astonishing, and this CD wonderfully demonstrates her evolving talents and intelligent, emotional interpretation of the material. 'Duboc' places Carol firmly at the top of her genre, right up there with Sade, Anita Baker, Patti LaBelle and other better known but not necessarily more talented contemporaries. The fact that she's also an award winning composer and lyricist helps to explain her obvious understanding of the complex themes that she expresses so beautifully with her voice."
3,"Yep, it's a gi top","I figured since my pants are lasting longer than my jackets, I'd order just the jacket. I'm still happy I purchased this item, but it is tissue thin.If you're looking for a really thin gi jacket (for say, summer), I'd recommend this one. I would not say it would last 30 seconds at Judo as tt doesn't seem to be built to take punishment. As a light weave that is to be expected, but when this takes ""light"" to a new meaning...So far it has survived a couple washings (and a little abuse, so it isn't completely fragile) and it makes a nice break when my main gi is a little too ""fragrant"" to wear between laundry days, but I wouldn't recommend this one as a replacement for a heavier weave top!"
4,Nice one,I received the order in record time and the material is lightweight and fits really well. The only downside is the tendency to wrinkle with the lighter material but if you throw it in the dryer for a few minutes with a damp cloth they come right out :)
5,Pays to shop around,"If you are considering tower speakers I would recommend NHT Super Two. New modles are more money from NHT and have metal dome tweeters.This is ok, but do you really want to replace all your speakers in your home entertainment system to metal dome.{so, the speakers sound the same}.I traded NHT Super Ones and receved a new set of Super Twos for $.... Super Twos have gone down from $... range to $.... Price,5 yr warranty,and a built in down firing sub make this a good choice for your home entertainment system."
4,Covers the field of transfusion problems exhaustively,"I used this text (8th edition) as an access tool to designing a neuralnetwork for recognizing transfusion reactions. I am nota medical practitioner, but work with practitioners designingexpert systems. My neighbor, a pathology intern, found thistext independently of me, and also felt it provided an indepth access to all the transfusion practice and problemsthat a practitioner would need. My need was to identifyfrom uncertain data potentially rare reactions and possiblecomplications. I also was concerned with the accuracy ofvarious testing and typing procedures and how they impactedthis data. Mollison's book provides strong statistical andclinical descriptions as well as qualifiying various practices.The new edition will undoubtably cover the broad researchperformed in blood banks and hemotology practice due to theHIV problem."
2,BAD picture quality - just so you know.,"The quality of the picture is REALLY lousy. The product is exactly as described, it's just that the picture isn't that great. It's really blurry."
4,serenata,Only criticism I have - the background instruments should have been located further away - castanets a little overpowering for the piano.....
5,Excellent Product,"Thank you very much, this was a perfect christmas present for my fiancee :). The video and sound run perfect, and it got here just in time."
4,A Good Read,"This offers a series of interviews in chronlogical order (from 1966 until shortly before his death in '85) While he is good humored and self effacing he never lets you know more than he wants you to. There are also certain repetitons of ideas that occur, but anyone that has read Borges before will be used to that. To some extent it happans with most of the better writers in varying degrees anyways. Even with the repetitions it never comes across like he is doing memorized routines (which sometimes happans with William burroughs interviews)all in all important insight into the mind of an important writer."
2,Frank Miller should sue!,In the 80's comic book legend Frank Miller created one of the toughest female characters of all time(before it was trendy) with Elektra a fearless merciless ninja assasin who takes on a demonic organization bent on taking over the government.In 2004 along came Hollywood.In this movie Elektra falls in love with a nice single dad and teams up with his 14 year old girl to kick butt.The gritty comic book is so watered down I kept expecting them to have a slumber party and maybe even a pillow fight before taking on those pesky ninjas!Star Jenifer Garner so great in Alias is bland here.The special effects and fight scenes are unimpressive and the story dull.Fortunately Miller made sure Hollywood didn't dillute his Sin City it's too bad he had no part in this film.
2,Elektra's not THAT bad.,"After watching Elektra, I was left wondering why such negative criticism? It was definitely more entertaining than Daredevil. There wasn't much substance to the storyline or the dialogue, but there were a few cool scenes - plus, it was fast paced enough not to really bore me. Maybe I wasn't as disappointed as some other reviewers because I never read the comic books or because I didn't expect much. Bottom line: rent, don't buy."
3,not bad,"Elektra entertained me for an hour and a half. Garner knocked my socks off. The whole thing seems a bit rushed since they snipped much of it down from an ""R"". The finished product isn't too bad considering how much this went under the knife before we got to see it. We could really use the lengthier ""R"" version of this one.There was clearly a better movie made involving these scenes.Let us have it."
4,Better than the reviews,"I passed on this movie for a while because I saw really bad reviews for but I caught it on HBO the other night and it's much better than I expected. It's nothing memorable but it wasn't boring or a bad film at all, definitly worth a watch atleast once."
5,Do not listen to the bad critics,"When this movie was first released, like catwoman, it got horrible reviews. So i didnt see it. I love superhero movies, so i thought i would just rent it when it comes out. Well that never happened. Finally i heard the directors cut was being released. So i thought why not, i'll buy it. I watched it and it actually makes me mad that this film got bad reviews because it's such a GREAT FILM. The villians in this film are amazing. They just blow my mind! Jennifer is hot as Elektra. Everything fits and works so well. This is just a good movie. Sure it's nothing spectacular or jaw dropping but it's a fun movie to watch and i recommand it to everyone!"
2,I wanted to like this,"But, try as I might, I can't buy Jennifer Garner in the lead role. She's simply not tough enough to be the least bit credible as an international assassin. She's neither athletic, nor much of a fighter, two qualities essential for an action star in this kind of role. Between the way the film is shot and her lack of moves, she comes off more as a model than an actor in this role. She was better in Daredevil... what happenned? There are a few nice moments here and there (mostly with the Hand), but there is not a particularly compelling script here to rescue the performance of the lead."
2,Elektra - Not even close as good as Daredevil,"I just watched this dvd and I have to say I wasn't too impressed by it. Although, I really enjoy Alias and think Jennifer Garner is a great actress in her own right, there wasn't much to this movie to really show her true talents as an actress. There wasn't a plot to this movie at all and there were so many flashbacks, it makes for confusion the whole way through. The action scenes were hardly entertaining and leave you wanting to see more. Daredevil was a far better movie and I think they should have brought some of that movie into this, even if it just meant her remembering ben affleck's character. All it showed was her childhood and nothing concerning that part of her life in daredevil. It didn't really make a lot of reference to her coming back from the dead either.....I think this movie should never come out with a sequel. Too bad for Jennifer Garner....maybe there will be a Daredevil sequel and Elektra could come back then."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This film Rocks!!!! Elektra is now one of my favorate marvel characters. This film is about Elektra is the worlds greatest asassin, but when she gets a job to kill a man and his daughter, she refuses. Soon, she has to battle four powerful asassins who are trying to kill the two victims. This film is full of action and dazzling FX. This is one of the best Marvel Movies, i recommend it!!!"
2,I love Jennifer Garner but not this movie,"Jennifer Garner can play a superhero conviningly - just watch Alias. However, writing is so important and this movie was flat out bad. Poor script and not engaging to watch.Would not recommend."
3,Okay...,"Being an Elektra fan, I was eager to seer this film. However, I must say that I am disappointed. This movie is not as faithful to its source material as it should be. Now of course, I know that movies are never exactly the same, and found myself satisfied with such films as Dune and The Color Purple, but this movie just didn't cut it.Nothing personal against Jennifer Garner, but I did not feel her appropriate for this role. She is not a bad actress per se, but this role was very unsuited for her, and the story itself isn't as much about Elektra as one would think. Overall, I can only give it 3/5 stars at best."
2,Preposterous Action Scenes,"I like Garner and think she's an appealing actress, and I liked her in Daredevil, but in this movie the action scenes are so weak and unbelievable. She is supposed to be a great fighter, but we hardly see anything, it's just implied that she is able to get past an army of ninjas or armed thugs. Then the battles with the superpowered guys are even more absurd, because any one of them could end the fight in a second. The story?.. not much there, there's a young girl who is supposed to be a good fighter so she protects her, and something about her learning from a blind teacher. Not as bad as Catwoman though."
3,Tattoos that come alive? Rock on!,"I admit that the special effects were great. But the story needs a lot of work. And I kind of doubt that after this whole big war that the bad guys could be finished off that easily. But, at least the dialogue was fluid and the fights were well-choreograpghed."
4,cool,i saw this movie before in theaters near my house. i must say that this was a really good movie. that has alot of action and a nice storyline.
4,A Sexy Superhero!!!,"The beautiful Jennifer Garner is back as Elektra! After being reborn from DareDevil, Elektra assassinates the bad guys. During Christmas time, Elektra moves to a cottage and meets Mark Miller and his 13-year old girl, Abby. She find out that her next mission is to assassinate them both. After having Christmas dinner, she doesn't want to and all three of them are being hunted down by an organization known as The Hand. There are a lot of special effects and action sequences. If you love action, and sexy Jennifer Garner, you'll love ELEKTRA!!!"
3,Not as bad as the reviews would have you believe,"Although the directing/editing is sometimes distractingly choppy and television-like (the way some tv movies are made to hide the lack of effects, budget,drama, etc.), this was a passably entertaining piece. There is very little exposition and what there is not very logical, but mostly the film functions as a live action storyboard with minimal dialog. The supervillains are pretty cool, though it's hard to understand how Stone was so easily dispatched. Jennifer Garner is lush to look at of course. Terence Stamp chews up the scenery effortlessly. Unfortunately there was a general lack of imagination in the overall plan for this movie. Do not try and compare it to Daredevil, which was actually a very good comic book movie. This is more like something you catch on cable late at night."
1,Someone wake me when it's over,"I remember the previews for this movie and they seemed very action packed. I put off seing it at the theater and rented it instead. Boy am I glad I did. I thought the movie just dragged along and had no plot. I'm not a big fan of action movies, but there wasn't even enough action in it for me. If you really want to see it that badly, rent it!"
5,good job,i wel buy form them for the dvd. wich the dvd on mydvd or ps3 play on they do there job on time
1,amazon review is all wrong....,"This director's cut does nothing except make a medicore movie look stupid, and no Mark Johnson and Frank Miller did not write this movie (they had nothing to do with it). The bonus features are also lackluster at best, Geek;s ville at worst."
1,Painful to watch...,This Movie was atrocious! I love bad movies but this one was a real stinker. Jennifer Garner was miscast in the Daredevil movie and certainly did not warrant her own spin-off film.
2,Mildly entertaining plagurism on the big screen. . .,"Seriously, I said plagurism. Why? Well the Hand's special forces seem to be a direct rip off of the Eight Devils of Kimon from the classic anime film ""Ninja Scroll."" A demon with skin of rock, a demon with living tatoos and a woman with a poison kiss...hmmmm. . . . identical.You can also delve deeper: Kimaguri (closest I'll get to spelling it right) in Elektra is an art that allows its masters to bring the dead to life. Sounds a lot like the reincarnation skill that Lord Genma possessed as well.But, that all being said, this movie is as good as a movie that could have been done after the Daredevil fiasco. Personally I had more fun picking out the Ninja Scroll similarities than actually watching the film. Definetly a renter not a keeper.Since when did Elektra have OCD in the comics? I grew up on Daredevil and have no recollection of this quirk! Am I wrong?"
2,"""Elektra"" should have been released straight to video","I was looking forward to see ""Elektra"" on DVD since I missed it in theaters, so I rented it today and I am glad I resisted purchasing this one. Jennifer Garner looks good and all (hence the 2 stars instead of 1), but even that can't save the lame story, dialogue, and special effects. This is truly one of the worst comic book adaptations ever and shares that spot with Halle Berry's ""Catwoman"". If you want to see an extremely great comic book film, go out and witness the masterpiece ""Sin City"" which I have already seen twice. That film is worth your time and money, so pass on Elektra. You have been warned!"
3,Entertaining,"A spinoff of the movie Daredevil. In this movie we find elektra alive and well after dying in Daredevil. But she is going through a rough time in which she doesn't see the HUMAN inside herself. AS an assassian she is given the job to kill a man and his daughter only to find out that she is the next generation of people who will save the world. SO Elektra can not kill her because of that. During the rest of the film we find that ELektra has indeed found her Humanity and self-respect again. She now is able to live life as she was meant to. With dazzling special effects and decent acting this movie is a more than entertaining film about self discovery. However, it is choppy at points and never truely pushs its ideals onto the audience in which it is trying to please. A movie that is good for fans of Comic books and an average entertaining movie for everyone else."
1,IT SUCKED!!!!,"I am now more than ever fully convinced that many of the people who post reviews on this site are shills working for the movie studios. How else to explain glowing reviews for unmitigated dreck like Envy, National Lampoon's Dorm Daze, and other garbage? True to form, several people have already posted a positive review of Elektra. I love comic books. I have loved comic books for almost thirty years. It pains me to see bad comic book movies because I know these movies contribute to negative public perception of comic books. Elektra was a bad comic book movie. I feel bad for Jennifer Garner. She demonstrated a lot of enthusiasm for the character and was not shy about telling interviewers about how she enjoyed reading the Elektra comics. But this movie is plain awful. The story plods along with very little action. It is just plain boring. I saw this movie with three fellow comic book fans and we were all bitterly disappointed."
3,Better than you'd think,"Or, at least, better than I expected. The whole story of how she is brought back to life is a stretch, but, hey, it is a comic book adaptation. Should the movie have been made? Well, why not, they brought the character back after killing her off in the Daredevil comic book story line, even though she was originally created for the purpose of dying.All in all, a descent enough movie, but I liked Punisher better. Of course, neither can touch Daredevil."
5,One for your collection,I thought Elektra was a great continuance of the Dare Devil - the two movies complement each other. I had to have it for my movie collection.
3,lady kung fu assassin,"She is cute, keeps her clothes on, and turns the evil guys into flashes of light as they die. I didn't see the blind master's hand in the whole affair. trying to teach her compassion, other than this it was straight forward and predictable. Nice martial arts action, worth a cheap rent or bargain bin buy."
1,dissapointment,"After the beautifully crafted Elektra ""garner"" in the daredevil movie, this elektra dissapoints too much. Bad haircut, horrible dressing, confusing plot..it could have been much better with some better taste in all those things. Catwoman was some kind of ""B"" superhero movie, but sadly, elektra is a ""C "" one, even I like a lot Jennifer Garner in Alias and Daredevil..some good songs in the sountrack, though.."
1,HD Not Available,I inadvertently selected HD only to find my desktop computer is not compatible. I was able to view the un-HD version just fine. Streaming went quickly unlike the story.
1,sucked so bad,"All she did was run from the evil assasins, and there should have been no way she could defeat them with the way the movie portrayed her, but of course she does. By the end of this slow, waste of time movie, I was ready for the bad guys to win. And why was the young girl so special? All she had was a magic rope. How in the world could that defeat the supernatural and superbly trained assasins? Give me a break."
3,Might be OK for a Jennifer Garner fan,"Not having seen this movie in the theatre I bought a copy mainly because the TV spots looked good.Somehow the story seemed slow moving and not a lot to it. I don't know how closely the plot might follow the comic books (apparently even they have changed over time)but I found that watching Jennifer Garner was the best part of it, she did very well as her character. The action scenes were interesting but there was a lot of talk and flashback stuff that just dragged it down for me.Elektra's abandoned childhood home, I noticed that it still had electricity and the gas was on in the kitchen, that looked like a flaw to me. The furniture sheets battle in that big room looked a little bit computer generated but interesting. I did like the extras included, seeing how some of the movie was made helped out a little."
5,Jennifer Garner is so hot!,What a good action film too. The martial arts are great. She looks amazing in the red leather too! It really is a good movie too!
