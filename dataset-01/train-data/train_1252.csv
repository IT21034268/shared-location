1,"Beware seller HealioHealth, 73% feedback rating","I'm sure this is a great item and my rating is for the seller, not the item. Since I haven't received it, I can't yet rate it. I really would like to have received this product that I ordered from seller HealioHealth on October 30, 2010 because I've had a sore left knee for 8 months. HealioHealth ignores all communication, has zero customer service and no desire to make an effort to solve problems. Please be sure to read a sellers profile and feedback ratings or you could be sorry. You should only order from sellers with a 98% and above rating. HealioHealth has a 73% feedback rating with customer comments stating this seller should be off of Amazon. I agree! Indeed, eBay would have kicked them off at a 95% rating. Many other sellers sell this product and I would strongly suggest you shop from a different seller. This is a public service message."
5,Great Background for Newer Fans,"Foege does a great job of describing Sonic Youth from its beginnings in the early 70s until 1995. Being I was barely able to walk when Sonic Youth first formed, and not even a fan until 1995, I was eager to learn about the beginnings of the group. Seeing where the band, especially where Thurston comes from is a great way to understand their music. It also does a great job in describing the influence Sonic Youth had on the music world.Yes, 200 some pages hardly does justice to Sonic Youth. But being that there is no other biography on the band, I'd recommend that any fan picks up a copy of this book... I think I've read my copy three times."
2,very boring,i wanted to read about sonic youth and all i found out was how kim and thurston met and lee almost left the band once.other than that it was all about each album and what that album meant to the progression of music and blah blah blah!the writer would go on and on about other bands and other writers and it was very annoying.if i wanted to read about glen branca i would buy the glen branca book.and then the amount of pages that he wrote about some sc-fi author from the fiftes was just too much.it is great that this author influenced thurston but c'mon you could have read that in about two pages and got the idea.you can tell that sonic youth told this guy what he could and could not write about very boring.i wanna read the juicy history of one my all time favorite bands not this crap
3,Decent but dry,"This book was okay, and I'd recommend it for the enthusiastic Sonic Youth fan who can't find anything else or can afford to be a completist. It was just a little dry, with discussions of the first show at which the group used particular tunings and such, but I'm sure some people would really want to know that. It was just a little cold, more about the making of the music than the inspiration or the makers, for the most part."
3,Passable summation of the band's career up till 1994,"With a comprehensive discography of this key band's output up to 1994, and an interview-heavy chronology of the group's life, Confusion is Next is an okay aid to placing Sonic Youth in rock history (and explaining their obsession with Philip K. Dick). But even band member Thurston Moore, in his preface, laments the lack of real human insight here, and too often Foege's repetitive, awkward prose makes this read like someone's overlong journalism-school thesis."
4,Good Information for the New SY Fan,"When I bought this, in 1995, I was fairly unfamiliar with the history of the group or their earlier works. I think this is the reason I enjoyed it so much. Yes, the writing can be dry and unrevealing at times, but it did serve as a good introduction to Glenn Branca and Philip K. Dick for me."
3,a bit of a snore,"While it serves as an interesting introduction to anybody remotely interested n the group, the book is really somewhat to ""stuffy"" in the way it is written. it will help place Sonic Youth in its context but will not really manage to convey the complete picture of this ground-breaking band. As such this is much to literate in its approach and not ""rock'n roll"" enough. There was another earlier larger book from Spain I think (in LP format) that came out earlier with a CD that was more entertaining but I cannot remember what is was called."
4,Technical Writing: A Practical Approach (5th Edition),"Only problem..packaging was very bad, arrived opened. The book was not damaged."
3,This book explain Jewish characters in italian literature,"This book try to explain the different representations of Jewish characters in Italian literature between 1840 and 1938. There are a lot of interesting data, but some of these are taken from the article Italy, s.v. literature, of the Jewish Encyclopedia. This work wants also show how many anti-semitic stereotypes we can find in italian literary imagination before fascist racial persecutions (1938-1945, but the analysis concerns few authors."
3,so so,"This ligh is cheapley made, missing a plug that holds the inside into the light. Also looks like a kid but it together. It works but for how long? Not worth the price if you ask me.. also said its a ""All Glass Aquarium Flo Twin Strip 48"" Black"" but its a different brand."
4,surgartooth,"If I had to get rid of all but 10 of my 100+ cd's, this would be one I would keep. Cracks in the pavement is an awesome song."
5,Bringing back the memories,"I loved this album when I was 18, and I bought it recently and turns out I still love it. Good tunes."
1,As a thief,"Very interesting, but very paranoid. More of a 'what if' scenerio than actual basis. Designed to scare and not prepare."
3,TRULY SICK & HILARIOUS STUFF THAT'S NOT FOR THE KIDDIES!,"OK, first of all...THIS STUFF IS NOT FOR CHILDREN! Parents, please note that even the cover of the DVD states this. These are ""adult"" cartoons for the the 18+ crowd. Got it? Good!Now, though these cartoons are great, this particular DVD is a bit of a rip-off. There are a total of 16 cartoons, each about a minute in length, plus some extras. But would it have killed Mondo Studios to put everything on one DVD instead of three? Must they be that greedy?Back to the cartoons: incredibly violent, truly twisted and screamingly funny.Cartoons: 5 StarsDVD value: 1 StarYou make the call..."
2,Just watch them online,"If you're even looking at this review, you know what Happy Tree Friends is, and what to expect. You'll already know whether or not you'll find the stuff on this DVD funny.But I wouldn't really reccomend you buy this DVD, unless you just have to have the cartoons on a disc. Considering the price, and the ridiculously short run time of the DVD, this is very poor value for money - especially when you consider there's a second volume that could easily fill out this disc. The compression isn't very good on this one, so I doubt it was a space issue.While I love the Happy Tree Friends, I just can't imagine parting with that much money for so little. I reccomend just watching them online."
5,MASTERPIECE,"THIS ANIMALS ARE CRAZY,NO MORE LOADING NO MORE WAINTING IN YOUR COMPUTER YOU CAN SEE THIS ANIMALS WITHOUT MORE LOADING BUT ONLY BAD THIS DVD DONT HAVE BUDHHIST THE MONKEYTHIS DVD CONTAINS.4 SMOCHIES (INTERCATIVES)14 EPISODES REGULAR1 NEVER SEEN EPISODE (BUT THIS EPISODES IS AVAIBLE IN THE INTER)THE ESPISODES WITH COMENTARY OF THE CREATORSTHE FIRSTS DRAWSORGINAL FORMULAESPECIAL POP CORN EPISODEMEET THE CHACTERS OF HAPPY TREE FRIENDS"
1,trash,"My son asked for this DVD for Christmas. I didn't know what it was all about, so came on here and to read the reviews. I was stunned. The cover of the DVD looks cute. Thought it was about adorable animals. Went on the happytreefriends.com website and actually watched a couple of episodes. This made me sick to my stomach. It's even worse that they market this trash to young children.Needless to say I will not be purchasing this for my son. If any parent actually buys this DVD filled with gratuitious violence, then in my opinion, they are totally irresponsible and bordering on bad parents. Allowing a child to view depections of animals getting maimed and tortured is sick. Personally I don't think Amazon should even carry this trash."
1,"Beware bad compression. In fact, just visit the website.","Happy Tree Friends are like Itchy and Scratchy for the even-shorter attention span. With their pastel colors, big round outlines, and situations that would be painfully predictable if they had any story to them at all, the best thing about this series is the infectious theme music. Unfortunately, said theme is missing completely from this DVD. For the full experience, visit the Happy Tree Friends' website. This is how these cartoons should be viewed, anyway. At least the Flash will load, there; the copy of the DVD that we viewed was so poorly compressed as to be unwatchable, plus it crashed every computer and component dvd player we played it in."
1,"No, No, No!",I have saw this online because my cousin had the pleasure of showing it to me and this is not humour... and it should not be for kids or little kiddies!! This NEEDS a rating!
1,needs a rating.,This DVD has a lot of graphic violence. The people who market this DVD did not put a rating on it. It should have an R rating or an ( X or NC-17 rating) so that only people over 17 can watch it. Please do not let children under 17 see this DVD.
5,Not for those faint of heart or stomach.,"If you don't like cartoon violence, don't even watch. These little creatures take cartoon violence soaring to new heights. Basically, there is a cast of adorable characters who just happen to have minor problems - Flippy has Vietnam flashbacks that make him go on killing sprees; Handy is the handyman that has no hands; Lumpy is, well...Lumpy. Each cartoon is only about a minute long, but it is always fun to watch the different ways the writers of the show come up with to have the characters kill each other off (always purely by accident). It is just a fun show, NOT FOR KIDS, that you watch when you need your spirits uplifted."
4,Funny violent cartoons,"This is in the same vain as south Park or Spike and mIke Sick and Twisted, where it's violent disturbing cartoon skits, what makes it enjoyable is that it's always witty. I recommend this DVD, there is a little redundancy when you go from one skit to another, in that it lags due to the ""intro"" they have on the onset of every skit."
4,"Cute, but so wrong.","Happy Tree Friends...They are cute and funny. I could suit this only over 12-oldpeople, because it is so VIOLENTIC! It reminds me from Ren & Stimpy, South Park and Beavis & Butthead. It is comedic, and many cute animals habit the episodes. There is Cuddles the yellow rabbit, Sniffles anteater (he is extra CUTE!!),wickedVietnam Veteran mink Flippy and the mischievous raccoon burglars Lifty and Shifty.If you are young, but like cartoons, buy this if you want.I liked this, because the cuddly characters and big fun"
5,The Real Shock & Awe with a Twist!!,"The concept behind HTFs is brilliant! Take the cutest and most innocent cartoon characters and put them to a most shocking, brutal and gory death. The shock value alone is a 10!! The animation is nicely done and the character design is superb. Just make sure your children don't watch this...While I have to agree with a prior reviewer about the extreme shortness of the actual DVD running time, you're paying for the concept. HTFs are huge hit...It's really fun!!"
1,Garbage,"Sheer Stupidity. Some people like that though, so, to each his own. I will never buy another one of these CDs again."
3,uber violent,"I got this for my 14 year old. It came on time. I don't personally like it but he loves it. Mind you this is NOT your road runner vs. coyote cartoon violence, this is very gory. Ren and Stimpy might be a better comparison, but even more than that. Just be aware of that."
1,software not included,The description of the writer implied that software was included. I specifically chose this article because it was described as working with Mac OS X. However I can not find software from iomega or anywhere else. The result is that the unit is useless to me.
1,This item eats more media than it burns.,I bought this new from Iomega and it goes through disks one after the other with media errors. I hate it!
2,Sting of the dragon masters,"One of the other reviews claimed that this movie was originally titled ""Hapkido"" ( AKA ""Lady Kung-fu"" ). That error caused me needlessly to pick up this video which was originally called ""When Taekwon-do Strikes"" when released earlier and stars Joon Rhee not Carter Wong. Not nearly as good as ""Hapkido"" which made much better use of Master Hwang (Whang)In-Shik and his senior Master Ji Han Jae (Game of Death). For Angela Mao fans only."
3,nice book for beginners,"a nicely written thin book on PET. all of the images were acquired using a GE PET Advance but this shouldn't deter siemens or other brand users. the first few chapters on the economics on putting up a PET scanner and cyclotron unit are a waste due to the different conditions existing in different countries. they should have spent more pages on cardiac PET. there is adequate coverage of neuro PET. oncologic PET, understandably, will never be enough as the science is still rapidly progressing. but this book should whet one's appetite for the other clinical oncology PET books around. i would have wanted a few chapters devoted to cyclotron and radiopharmacy operation since this is what a lot of PET MDs lack."
4,Positron Emission Tomography ; Correlation,"Positron Emission Tomography is a non invasive, diagnostic imaging technique for measuring the metabolic activity of cells in the human body. It is useful clinically in patients with certain conditions affecting the brain and the heart as well as in patients with certain types of cancer. The field of PET has been quickly emerging into clinical diagnostic medicine. PET has been in clinical use since the early 1990s.This is a very good book. This book covers from Basic to date advances in PET. All physical fields are describe. This book should be used as hand book of basic sicence of PETSCAN"
5,Sonic brilliance,"I'll admit that when I first listened to Daydream Nation, I wasn't so sure I liked it. It was lengthy, almost self-consciously difficult, dissonant, and strange. The second time through, I latched onto a few songs (""Teen Age Riot,"" ""Candle,"" ""Silver Rocket,"" ""Total Trash""). The third time through, however, I was completely hooked. Daydream Nation is an undeniable post-punk masterpiece, endlessly inventive and exciting. Melodies float in and out of the distorted guitar haze, songs are interrupted by feedback, noise, and lengthy, hypnotic instrumental passages. And somehow, it is still fairly accessible (that is, if you're okay with unconventional song structures, strange guitar tunings, and sheer noise). Admittedly, Sonic Youth is not for everyone, but if you can get in there, it's really great stuff. Highly, highly recommended."
5,grunge in a nutshell sprinkled with pixie dust,"Oh my god, SOnic youth is the most amazing band you may ever hear.......listen to trilogy for example.....this is not your average 3 chord grunge song.....nothing on this album is even in the leagues with other grunge bands....its lyrics have more depth to them than some of kurt cobain(god rest his soul) ....its amazing anyways so yeah bye...........tell all your french fryed friends to wiggle that gurth"
3,.,"i never really could hear this as a masterpiece as seems to be the general consensus. there's plenty of interesting stuff on it, some quite nice to listen to, but it's a little long and some of the vocals are really annoying. in general the lyrics aren't really my thing, but they probably appeal to people with different tastes. this and murray street are the only sy albums i own, and i prefer the latter."
1,Inside shattered,"The inside cd holder was shattered in one of the sides. The cd fell out and the inside looks very ugly from the scratches of the shattered plastic. The music is amazing, but to pay 25 dollars for a malfunctioned case was a huge let down. I bought the cd for aesthetic purposes, but was left disappointed."
3,Falls short of expectations,"I know I'm probably the only one out there who thinks so, but DN is not SY's crowning jewel. Of the 3 SY CD's I own DN is 3rd best (behind ""Goo"" and ""Dirty""). I feel that DN is too much sound experimentalism and not enough song structure. It starts promisingly with ""Teenage Riot"", and deteriorates from there into a shamble of guitar squeals, feedback, and epic montagues of white noise. Unless you're a hardcore SY junkie, the abrasive instrumentals and periods of extended guitar sound effects becomes ingratiating after a while, which makes the CD seem too long. There just seems to be a lack of cohesiveness and form on this particular SY release compared to other SY albums."
3,I am not alone!,"Wow. two reviewers before me were not so impressed, either. what are the odds of that happening? I wouldn't say this is a bad album, but most of it bores me. I dunno, it just strikes me as mostly a bunch of generic rock songs. Even when the song structures get complicated it still bores me. I like the sprawl, cross the breeze, providence, and trilogy- but to my ears most of the other tracks are not essential. And I hate Silver Rocket. I can't articulate what it is I don't like about Daydream Nation, so I'll just say that I think it is their worst '80s album. It seems most people consider this to be sonic youth's masterpiece. But I'd say their best album is a tie between Evol and Washing Machine, with second place going to a tie between Bad Moon Rising and A Thousand Leaves."
4,good job,"i like this album a lot, but i still think evol is the better choice...it is a more ""mellow"" albumm than evol. well anyway get both of them. the trilogy is awesome!"
3,A Very Tough Listen,"In truth, I think Sonic Youth are massively overrated in indie circles, but this album does have some good stuff on it. The first four tracks are the highpoint of the album, ""'Cross The Breeze"" in particular is thrilling and unquestionably the best track on here. After that, things are a little more mixed, with a fair bit of what I would call ""filler."" The main problem with this album is it's tonal repetitiveness and it's sheer length. This is a seriously difficult album to take all in one sitting, in fact I can't listen to the album the whole way through, it just doesn't hold my interest. Overall, it's compelling at times but I wouldn't call it any kind of masterpiece. New listeners are better off starting with Goo, Dirty or even Murray Street. None of those have a song as great as ""'Cross The Breeze"" but they provide more rewards for the casual listener."
3,It's okay...,"As someone who likes SY best somewhere between their poppiest and their noisiest (eg, Washing Machine,) I've never gotten to appreciate this the way the critics and many/most other fans do. It seems cold and impersonal to me, with the exception of most of the Thurston songs. I'm pretty sure that I just don't ""get"" it, but the point is, not all who otherwise get SY will be as crazy as they may have come to expect about this, so don't be turned off from trying more of the band if this only strikes you as so-so."
5,EPIC RECORD,An expanded version of this CD is classic. Many 90s bands cite this CD as a major influence and a favorite. It is brilliant from beginning to end.
3,why why why?,"i mean, let's not joke: this record towers over the best records by most other bands. ""kissability"", ""teenage riot"", and ""hey joni"" are some of the best songs sonic youth has ever written. but their best record? hardly. in my sonic youth collection, only ""experimental jet set, trash & no star"" and ""nyc ghosts & flowers"" gets throw on less. particularly in the context of hearing these songs live (both at the time and even now), the performances on this album are less than inspired and the production drains even more life out of 'em. don't get me wrong: i love me some sonic youth - no question. i just find it wild that ""daydream nation"" constantly get heralded as their masterpiece when most of the records surrounding it (""sister"", ""bad moon rising"", ""evol"", and ""dirty"" in particular) all put it to shame. great record - just not their best."
4,Very Good,"The godfathers (and mother) of grunge. In a perfect world, this album would be a million-seller and Sonic Youth would be as popular as Nirvana is today. Nah, these anti-rockstars would never hear of it."
5,Incredibly influential and powerful,"This is one of the most important albums of the last twenty years. The sound the band created here has echoes in countless other albums by other bands in the years that followed. Aside from the influence, though, the music is simply great to listen to. ""Teenage Riot"", in particular, is one of the all-time greatest rock songs with its mix of driving guitar and unfrogettable lyrics that sum up the dependence young people have on rock and roll: ""You come runnin' in on platform shoes/With Marshall stacks, to at least just give us a clue"". Lots of bands got clues from this masterpiece."
5,Indispensable,"Fantastic. 70 minutes of sheer delight. There's great guitar work, but not in the Iommi-esque way I tend to dig, nor in the shredding style executed by messer Eddie Van Halen. Nope, this is rough and experimental, arty and rockin' at the same time. No, its not Roxy Music. No, its not the Buzzcocks. However, it is good fun. A rousing track will melt into feedback and noise, only to return later on. Or it may well just vanish into crackling obscurity. Either way, the whole thing is solid. There's a weird track in the form of ""Providence,"" but it's not lame in an ""FX"" (Sabbath) or ""Mensforth Hill"" way. It's just a slight detour, based on a piano riff, an amp and a recorded voice. Not bad at all.Highlights include: ""Teen Age Riot,"" ""Silver Rocket,"" ""The Sprawl,"" ""Total Trash"" and ""Trilogy: Eliminator Jr.""Stop reading slobbering reviews and buy this album. ""Teen Age Riot"" alone will probably provoke some drastic change in your life the first time you listen to it."
5,Music that changed the world.,"This is one amazing album. It sounds as if it should have been released at least 3 years later than it was. This was some of the stuff that redefined the music industry and brought all that other great music. This was a very innovative album, but what do you expect from a band who has been doing that since they got together. The post-punk songs like ""silver rocket"" and ""joni's song"" are what make this album great, plus the classic ""teenage riot"". And it's also a super saver, so how can you go wrong with this, unless you're turned off by the eighties."
1,I don't get it,"It's dissonant, chaotic and pretentious. I hate not being able to appreciate it because so many people do. I'll keep trying and get back to you."
2,dont believe the hype,"Contrary to popular opinion, I find this album very difficult to digest. For me it went straight through and out my system like a wad of grass. The vocals, particularly the chick's, are bleh (you can hear exactly where courtney love stole her annoying bark from), and the music is just very plain; suffice it to say, plain music is not exclusively bad, but in this case it's nothing special. It's not pretty, it's not exciting, it's not relaxing, it's not anything.I bought daydream nation to see what all the hype was about, maybe it was the wrong album to initially acquaint myself with, but after listening to it seveal times, putting it away for months and listening to it again, it's still a lump of fiber.I gave it a chance and I feel like I wasted my time. Don't make the same mistake, unless you are predisposed to early punk/new wave/whatever the heck this is, (which I am not particularly) you might just be looking for something that isn't there."
2,I thought it was ok...,"A lot of people like this album, and critics are always saying how this is the greatest indie album of all time. I could see for the late 80's how this could be groundbreaking, but this 2009. And there alot of people who do similiar things to this band. That being said, I do like Sonic Youth's Cover of the Carpenters Album, being a carpenters fan, myself.As for this one, I just found it to be too quiet, too dull, and not very original. I will say on the bright side that the cover artwork is way ahead of its time. And so was the band, which i have to give credit to them. I thought Daydream Nation and Teenage Riot were ok. Overall, if your into rock music then def. buy this album."
2,Another mediocre offering from an overrated band,"Perhaps no band represents the gap between poseurs of the alt-80's/90's and those who just like good music than Sonic Youth. The band takes a 25% kernal of passable melody and written piece; adds distortion and instrumental effects as filler for the other 75%, calls it an album and releases it. The poseur crowd and a few critics love it.The rest of us are out a $15 cd purchase.Be forewarned; they don't get better than this distortive semi-musical cd, it's actually the height of their creative output. Save your money and buy any Pixies or Pavement cd instead. Most of us work far too hard for our money to let it go to waste."
2,sonic youth dream,This album is one of the best sonic youth album...I advise everyone to listen this album...Break the circle of common popular music...This album irritates your soul and freedback your dreams...
5,sy best album.,DN is so great. I love all the songs in it. All of them is excellent. My fav song in this album is the sprawl. The sprawl is 1 of the best song i ever listened in my whole life.
5,Sheer Brilliance!,"This CD completely sets the Punk/Alternative standards. I'm astounded at how Thurston and the crew can make that much music. Rain King is amazing, along with the incredible farewell, Trilogy. If your down with modern alternative, check their roots by listening to this. I give it a 10 without thinking twice."
5,I have been to the river!,"Sally Stoner's sharings brought me right into the river, and into camp, and to the mountains and fields and streams. I truely enjoyed the relaxed and intimate manner in which she involves the reader. I feel as though I know these people, and have spent many hours and years with them. A must read!"
3,This kinda works,"They always tell you to start out with black as a base. They don't say why. Trouble is the prism coat is really a clear coat with the prism metallic flakes in it. After 3 coats over the black base, it still looks mostly black. It is like metallic black. I ended up putting 6-7 coats on and it still looked like dark gunmetal grey. The sample image for the Ice Kit showed the result being closer to silver. To get to silver you would need at least 20 coats of the middle layer. Trouble is they only give you a small can of the middle layer. I used it all up and had plenty left of the black base and clearcoat top layer... The prism effect worked kinda..."
2,Mr Berkman,The product Mirage Color Shifting Paint Ice Kit was not like the picture shown. When used it came out Gray with a little bit of color in it. The picture shows something diffirent. I would NOT buy this product if I had known this. I have also bought the Red/Blue kit and that was great
1,I should have known it was too good to be true!,"I was very excited to find all of the Marc Bolan/T. Rex hits on one album and at such a great price. Should have known it was too good to be true. I'm not sure who recorded this or where they got the Marc Bolan vocal tracks, but this is NOT true Marc Bolan/T. Rex music. These are someone else's arrangements of Marc Bolan/T. Rex songs, using the vocal tracks (some of which are very poor quality, sounding like a transister radio held up to a cassette recorder's external microphone) and dubbing them with new instrumental arrangements. For example, ""Jeepster"": fun little rock song, right? Not on this album! It's a slow, romantic ballad with cheesy keyboard and electric piano. Truly awful! I broke my copy in half and threw it away! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,"An abomination, must be heard to be believed","Marc Bolan was a startlingly unique talent, marrying Tolkeinesque whimsy with stripped down rockabilly hooks. He deserves a career spanning two-disc, charting both hits and worthy album tracks. Unfortunately, what we have here are T. Rex classics featuring horrendous overdubs, obviously added during the last few years. The effect is similar to the Hank Williams recordings MGM issued in the sixties, featuring syrupy strings and percussion. This compilation should be avoided at all costs."
2,Dated and formulaic,"With the cast of musicians assembled here, I expected a great deal more and thought this music would have more staying power. I just listened to ""Arc Angels"" again and can only wonder what might have been had the band stayed away from clichés and worn-out themes centered on ""having a good time"" and instead gotten down to business and played like these guys could have.We are left with a moment in time, dated and formulaic with moments when everything clicks, but these moments are too infrequent and brief to sustain interest. Update: I have to admit I am puzzled by all the ""unhelpful"" votes for this negative review. So I listened to this CD again, or tried to, and have to stick with impression that though there is a lot of talent here, the music does not sustain much interest."
3,too much...music at one time..,I am getting to old...to listen to long to this...still..I know Bramhall in BMD..before the music dies...so cool...a musician of integrity!!!
4,LOVE IT!!,"Nuff said.Only thing better is to see them on Sixth Street in Austin.In March of 2009 the members of Arc Angels, minus Tommy Shannon, announced that they would be reuniting, releasing a DVD of concert footage taken during 2005, touring extensively and beginning work on their second album. The DVD will also contain two new songs.Watch for it! Too bad Shannon won't be on it."
5,Arc Angels,"Outstanding first CD. Problem is, it is the ONLY CD I can find by them. It rocks and then shifts to ballads, then back to rock."
5,Arc Angels,I like this group because a couple of them made up Double Trouble-Stevie Ray Vaughan's band. I think Doyle Bramhall III is the very best left-handed lead guitar player and he also plays with Roger Waters.
3,A Moment In Time,"This was a good band, but not a great recording. ""ARC"" stands for Austin Rehearsal Complex, which should give you an idea of the quick-and-dirty nature of what Bramhall and Sexton were up to. ""Living In A Dream"" is the strongest cut, by far, and while the playing is topnotch, it seems the tunes were dashed off pretty quickly. Still, the guys deserve credit for making what was at the time not very fashionable music. Bramhall's vocals are arresting, and Sexton's guitar playing is phenomenal. The rhythm section, needless to say, is solid as a rock. I wish they'd spent a little more time on the material, though. Bramhall is still out there, and his solo work is worth looking for."
5,Ida Early,Ida Early comes over the mountain is an awsome book!It has a lot of excitement! Now that I have read the first one I want to read the seguel. The morale of the story is that you shouldn't doubt yourself. If I had to rate this book 1-10 I would rateit a 10 because of all the excitment and lessons there are!
1,hay tna fans,i know why they keep on typing here. cause tna they dosent have there own dvd section. i dont even know if they have there own dvds they suck so much
1,Awful,Great American Bash was truly awful. A few years ago who would have thought that Bradshaw would be in the main event? No on cause he sucks. I am not sure who is worse Bradshaw or Batista? GAB had nothing worth watching and WWE should be ashamed of themselves for putting out such crap.
1,Move Along,"Move along, nothing to see here. Don't waste your money. You shouldn't have to pay to be bored."
1,Very Disappointing,This is my review of how much I think the Great American Bash PPV is worth.Heidenreich & Animal Vs MNM - 10 centsShort crappy matchChristian vs Booker T - 15 centsNothing reallyUs Title - Booker T Vs Chris Benoit - 20 centsAn alright matchMuhammed Hassan Vs Undertaker - 5 centsDamn Undertaker sucksRey Mysterio Vs Eddie Guerrero - $1Best match of the night buy they have had better matches in the past.The B.W.O Vs The Mexicools - 10 centsNothingBra and Panties - Melina Vs Torrie - NothingGet this crap off my TV.World Heavyweight Title - Batista Vs JBL 5 centsBatista and JBL are very boring wrestlers so this was a very boring match.So overall this PPV was worth $1.65.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,GAB 2005 is one of the worst wrestling shows I have seen in years. Batista vs JBL sucked and the whole Eddie and Rey storyline is so lame. Keep your hard earned money.
1,Why not?,"I totally agree with the reviewer that wrote the review ""Why TNA Rules and WWE Sucks."" Although Im not a mmeber on amazon.com and i cant find his review helpful he is true. Speak for yourself, because when you say ""who cares"" I do! You WWE fans are so blind you can't realize that your company is dying right before your eyes and by the way TNA will soon be on Spike so we can watch it. Screw WWE! TNA is the future!"
2,GAB Great American Boredom,"Christian vs Booker was good thats all.CLB should really be in the world title hunt or at least US champ.Benoit vs OJ, yawn. I've seen 90% of OJ's matches and I couldnt tell you a move he does. I've tried to get behind JBL, and I just cant. Boring in and out of the ring"

5,Don't be so hard on this DVD,I think that the GAB is going to be ok. I have not seen the video but I think it will have some pretty good matches but don't be so hard on this dvd

1,wwe is dead just admit it,"wwe is fading so bad and you fans cannot admit the fact that the company is going to be like that until they change there ways. first off stop putting limatations on all your wrestlers and let them competete to there full potential. secound get rid of the fony crap like the diva search and stupid promos that have nothing to do with wrestling, and last get rid of VINCE M PLEASE. he is ruining wrestling and what it stands for. at least most of the tna stars care about how they perform and to give the fans a great match every night. i suggest you wwe fans to check out ROH as well that have stars that will blow you away like Daniels, homicide, low ki and roderick strong and get away from the crap JBL,masters, and batista. and see what wrestling is without limatations."
1,TNA ok...............................WWE RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"the talent at tna cant even and will never be compared to wwe talent(except aj styles ,raven, abyss,jeff hardy,and some of the x division guys) . these guys should do the right thing and come to wwe because thats where they need to be. tna guys suck at acting and do some of the worst interviews eveeeeeeer. we gotta pay 30 bucks just to watch these guys do some good matches in pay per views cause they cant even put on good matches on impactplus the crowd doesnt even know who to chant for since most of the time there quiet. also the chicks at wwe are way hottttter that the chicks at tna trish stratus and torrie wilson are untouchable to the chicks at tna. u want great wrestling watch wwe..........................point is tna sucks compared to the real deal wwe"
3,Screw TNA!!!!!!,"I am sick and tired of all you wannabe wrestling company fans who are taking up WWE FAN's space to declare how great TNA is. TNA is just another company that WWE will buy and then all those great TNA stars will come over to the WWE, and the WWE will be on top ONCE AGAIN. WCW died because of Vince McMahon and TNA will die because of Vince McMahon!Screw TNA, Long Live WWE!!!!!!"
1,"A Great Soap Opera!!!!!....Wait a minute, this was WRESTLING!?!","The minute I watched this ppv I thought it was a joke. I thought they were being bad on purpose and Vince McMahon would pop out and say ""Nah just kidding, here's the real Great American Bash!"" If Eddie vs Rey didnt take place, this would be the Worst ppv EVER!!!!!!! Rey vs Eddie is a classic match so rent this DVD, copy that match onto your computer, and give it back. The rest is so terrible I cant put it into words. Great american Bash was a great tradition back in WCW! In WWE, it looks like a joke. I want WWE to keep GAB but for god sakes, next year make it at least DECENT!"

5,WWE GAB 2006 Predections,"1. World Heavyweight Championship Rey Mysterio vs King BookerWinner : King Booker ( with the help from Sharmell and Finlay)Booker's retirement was near, but he hasn't ever won WWE and World Heavyweight Championship. I think King Booker will become a champion.2. Batista vs Mark HenryWinner : Batista (clean win)3. The Undertaker vs The Great Khali Punjabi Prison MatchWinner : The Great Khali ( I hope Kane will cost The Undertaker here and at Summerslam 2006 it will be Kane vs The Undertaker)4. U.S Championship Finlay vs William Regal vs LashleyWinner : Bobby Lashley5. Cruiserweight Championship Gregory Helms vs Joey MercuryWinner : Joey Mercury ( new champion and a clean win). I think Mercury will turn face when he defeats Helms.6. Tag Team Championship The Mexicools vs Kendrick&London;Winner : Kendrick&London; ( clean win)7. I hope there will be The Boogeyman's return"
3,TNA [.......] SUCKS!!!!!,"Are you frickin kidding me? Why are TNA ""Wrestling"" fans taking up WWE fans time with their stupid reviews of how TNA is the next ECW? Wake up you morons, TNA will NEVER be on the same level as ECW, so why don't you guys go back to your website, frickin losers.....By the way, the new names TNA have made for the New Age Outlaws are very, very, stupid, Kip James, give me a god damn break......."
2,Bring back Bash at the Beach!!!!!!!,Bring back Bash at the Beach!!!!!!! My 2 favorite WCW ppvs are Great American Bash and Bash at the Beach!!! Now that you bought one back bring back the other! By the way this years GAB sucked! Hope WWE keeps it but makes it better!
1,How do you spell boring?,"This is a review of the Great American Bash 2005. I paid $35 and sat down and watched the pay per view. After I had watched 1 hour I started to feel like I had wasted my money. 20 minutes went by and I knew I had wasted my money. I started thinking about what I could have done with my money had I not spent it on this show. Pizza, Krispy Kreme mmm yum. When the main event came on I feel asleep and dreamed of what I could have spent my money on. Don't do the same as me. Keep your money and use it wisely."
1,stupid,"this ppv ruined the role.since wrestlemania.hrough vengeance.un vengeance.is a raw ppv/and this ppv.kinda sucked.all the action. the torrie vs melina. beniot vs jordan, batista gets dqed.like an a hole.should of never used the chair.vengeance was better than gab.5 star ppv.all the mtches were good. only with 6 matches.on the card.to beat smackdowns 8/matches on a card.overall this ppv is 3/ 10whichs means horibe endings.watch the strecher match"
1,Disappointment,"The Great American Bash has showed that smackdown is continuing to fall. On the other hand, the Raw ppvs are doing much better. Smackdown should be let go from it's onair time slot. Overall, without smackdown, the WWE would be doing much better."
5,Great American Bash predictions.....,Crusierweight Title MatchPaul London vs. JuventudeUndertaker vs. Muhammad HassanEddie Guerrero vs. Rey Mysterio - Special StipulationOrlando Jordon vs. Chris Benoit - U.S. title matchMNM vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Mexicools - Tag Team ChampionshipChristain vs. Booker TBatista vs. JBL - Street Fight
1,The WORST THING EVEEEEEEEEER!,I can not believe you can not get 0 stars because this was no doubt the worst pay per view ever.The only great match was Eddie Gurrero against Rey Mysterio. The worst match was every other match I swere to god that you will fall asleep in the final match.I can not believe that Beniot and Jordan could go so long in that match. Benoit could've beaten Orlano Jordan within 1 minute.Please use your money on something else then this piece of stupid trash
1,BULL CRAP,how all you idiots gave gay american bash 5 stars for predictionsand vengence 05 4 stars.this ppv will suck. stop the predictions.i getttin pissedwatch gay american bash be a failure.............. pitifull ................... IT WILL BE HORRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!

1,gab was a loads of shit,all the matches were crap the best match were rey and eddie but we seen it loads of time there been going on 4 moths there just boring me now the main event i could tell it was going 2 be crap john cena is on top becos hes on raw and batista is a loads of crap on smackdpwn i loved him on raw benoit is crap tonight he beat triple h and hbk at wrestle mania and backlash making then both tap and he beat triple h again and he beat kane but he could not beat the crap usa champion orlando jordan smckdown is so crap teddo long is crap it was goos when spehina was gm smackdown was well good then make smackdown good againget a new GM LOL
3,nice transfer,"with all the interest in the film scores of hollywood's golden period, i was expecting an orchestra tearing through rozsa's hot, burningly passionate score of minnelli's 1949 madame bovary.i didn't get it. i got a lift from the soundtrack. it's not bad but i set my hopes a little too high.i can still enjoy the melodies, particularly the passepied and waltz. they're like scores for mini-ballets."
1,This is not an actual case - Loose sachets were delivered in a postal box,"I ordered quantity 2 of this item. The Nutella sachets came loosely packed in a postal box. There were 72 of them (2 cases worth), but I had to count them all to determine whether I even got what I paid for.I thought I was ordering two cases as illustrated in the photo but my shipment did not include the Nutella branded box which appears in the photo."
3,ok,By the big containers. You get more spread per $ than if you buy these little containers. otherwise they are handy.
2,"Love the nutella, not the delivery","These individual nutella packets are going to be great for school lunches, but I was very disappointed with how they arrived. I expected them to come in a case like the one pictured, and instead received them crammed into a flat rate mailing envelope, with several of the packets squashed. I was charged 10.88 in shipping fees. Not cool."
1,Nutella Mess - Packets Leaked in Both Boxes. Ruined!,Fairly simple. Take a great product like Nutella. Package in convenient single servings (great for camping) and sell them. Ordered 2 boxes for a trip to Everest this Spring. Opened both boxes and discovered a mess - leaked packets everywhere. Don't waste your time or money. Better off buying a container from the store. I'm sure this not the first time this has happened.
2,Better Product Package,"I thought this would be a good idea for travel, but I was wrong. When I received the Nutella several of the individual packages had opened and were leaking. I tried to pack some in lunch boxes and the same thing happened. It makes a mess! I would not buy the individual packages of Nutella again."
2,This Cd. is the best metal Cd. to come out of the '90's,"I picked this Cd. up at a record store for the art work. Besides awesome artwork, it also contain's some awesome material too. The music buuilds like a wave throughout the Cd. It is VERY HEAVY. Not fast, just slow churning riffs that remind me of Black Sabbath on mescaline. Buy it A.S.A.P. You will not be dissapointed. This is the best band in the underground."
5,The Greatest Hole Album in the World!,I loved Live Through This! Courtney Love really showed expression and especially in songs like Miss World and Doll Parts. If you are planning on getting your first Hole CD this is definitely the best one!
5,This is my all-time favorite CD!,This is simply an amazing CD. Courtney Love is an incredibly talented woman who manages to convey a sense of rage and vulnerability at the same time. I love her voice! This is the CD that got me through my divorce - I felt as though these songs were written just for me. Bravo!
4,"The ""Hole"" album is good.","I imagine I'm one of many people who can't stand ""Courtney Love"", but really like ""Hole"". This is easily their best album, and I think it was released only days after ""Kurt Cobains"" suicide. It makes sense that the two of them were together. ""Hole"" even sounds in many ways like ""Nirvana"", but with that ""Courtney"" touch. Alot of the songs here are good strong rockers, but others like the hit ""Doll Parts"" and ""Softer Softest"", really show a more gentle, delicate side of the band. Other ""hits"" were ""Violet"" and ""Miss World"". It's too bad that ""Hole"" may end up being remembered more for ""Courtneys"" antics, than being one of the premier female-fronted alt/rock bands of the 90's, along side ""L7"" and ""Veruca Salt"", whom they toured with."
3,Good work by a gross person,"I cannot stand Courtney Love b/c she is a low life of a person. The concept of a well-to-do person not being able to even retain her child is astonishing. I am not religous but her lifestyle was truly sinful and revolting.That being said, as bad as a person that she seems to be, this is a quality work. Some people may feel that if there was not the Kurt Cobain connection, it would not have been as popular. Maybe if this was done by a classier, less abrasive artist, it would have received more accolades?The most important question to ask is did Courtney Love write these songs or did Kurt Cobain? She never did anything else after this."
5,"That ""dead bass player"" had a name...","...and it was Kristen Pfaff, and she is the reason, the ONLY reason why this album is so good. Kristen was an amazing songwriter and one of the best bass player's of her era, and she could sing a lick too. After listening to Janitor Joe's ""Big Metal Birds"" CD, I now know why I love this album so much. For years I couldn't understand why I enjoyed this CD as much as I did, since I think Courtney is a talentless psycho who steals ideas, sounds, and fashions from others, and Eric Erlandson is a below average guitarist at best who's working at a Dairy Queen in Idaho right now. So yeah, this album is great, but give credit where credit is due. Celebrity Skin is garbage, Pretty on the Inside is garbage. Thanks for making a great record before you were murdered Kristen!!"
5,This CD is awesome,I've wanted this CD since I first saw Hole on MTV back in 1994 or 1995. Courtney Love does a great job with the vocals and the rest of the music is great. This is a must have CD for all Hole fans.
3,"Ignore the hype, just listen to the mustic","There is a time and place for everything. The time and the place for me, to listen to this album, is any time I'm angry or stressed. Turn up the stereo and blast out Violet, Miss World Doll Parts - hell.. just blast out the whole darn album.Courtney's voice is kind of raspy and sweet at the same time, but I find that it fits completely with the songs and the sentiment of this album.The guitar playing is loud and brash, just like Ms. Love, and Live Through This.When it comes down to it, I think that if you could personify a person into music, then Live Through This would BE Courtney - at times quiet and pretty, at times suddenly surprising you with loud abrasive rock and expletives, disarming you, offending you.Did I mention I love this album?"
3,The Girl With The Most Cake,"I am convinced that Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love would have taken over the world if he had lived another 5 years. Beyond losing a muse (for whom she was also a muse), she seems to have lost her focus since his death, spending altogether too much time posing for magazine covers and going to Hollywood premiers.Which is a shame, because ""Miss World,"" ""Doll Parts,"" ""Plump,"" ""Gutless"" and my favorite, ""Rock Star,"" have more guts and bravado than 99% of the garbage you'll hear on so-called ""alternative"" radio.But Courtney Love has never been about fulfilling anybody else's expectations. So maybe my wishing she'd lose the high fashion and spend 6 months putting together a really killer LP is just more male-domination--just another example of the Man keeping Sisters down.I dunno.I just think she rocks."
2,Not her Best,"It's funny but when you look at Courtney, you wonder how could this chick be a punk rocker. She seems so straight edged. I don't think that that is her on the front cover unless she just has too much makeup on. Still I am impressed. I just can't imagine her acting very hardcore around David Arquette. I don't think he would tolerate it. Oh yeah the album isn't very good. You should just probably buy the ""Friends"" second season on DVD. That's when Courtney really shows her true colors."
1,Rip off plus some,"To those of you who think this album is so great and who think Courtney Love is so great, I have something that may change your mind. First of all, this album IS a rip off. If Courtney would have never even met Kurt I dont even think this album would exist. Second of all, Kurt didnt commit suicide, Courtney killed him. Dont believe me, go to justiceforkurt.com"
4,good,"If you're into Nirvana,you would like this cd.It seems like :her: writing style is a bit too similar to Kurdt's on this cd.Regardless,it's a good cd."
4,Live Through THIS!,"This is one awesome and rockin album! This is real, take no prisoners, in your face rock. Courtney gets down and dirty. She is raw and angry and unafraid."
3,"some good songs, some bad songs...","It took me a long time to acutally listen to any of Hole's stuff. But I heard this was a really good album so I put aside my hate for Courtney Love and acutally bought it. And I must say, it's not that bad. There are really good songs on here like Violet, Asking For It, Doll Parts... and then there are just some songs that aren't too hot. One of their songs actually sounds just like ""Radio Friendly Unit Shifters"" by Nirvana. This cd was praised to be the best album of the year by Spin magazine. And I just don't see how it can be the best. Like I said, I only really like half the album. So I suggest buying this album if you like Hole a lot. If not, save your money and buy a Bikini Kill cd or a Nirvana cd instead."
5,Not much of a review but don't miss Live Through This,Live Through This is perfect if you're a teenage girl and you need someone to identify with. And even if you're not this is still a fantastic album.
4,Live Through This,"Nice, loud and at times (later in the cd) a little tiresome. But the great songs are ""great"" making this a no brainer to have in your collection."
5,"Oh, yes! Hole is the best","One of the best things in the world is to hear to some damn good music. If you think like this BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW! I mean it, man. Live Through This is one of the best albuns ever and it is a must-buy for rock fans like me. I took me a while to find it in Brasil but it was worth the wait. This is Courtley Love on her best way to be Courtney Love!"
5,SuperStars,"Kakva buka i kakav bunt.Kakva lepota!!!Bes koji osecate kroz svaki rif i kroz svaki otpevani stih.Da je bilo vise ovakvih bendova, svet bi danas zasigurno izgledao mnogo drugacije.Live through this, prijatelju!"
3,HOLE.......COOL NAME FOR A BAND,"Hole, Korn, Slayer, Pantera, Gwar and White Zombie are the coolest band names ever. oh yeah and Cannibal Corpse."
1,Punk rock by number,"I had to endure listening to this CD because my ex loved Hole. Fortunately, I broke up with her - my ex and Hole are angry for some reason which neither can't explain very well. How sad."
3,All right but definatly not one of Hole's best cds,"When I first got this cd I was disappionted. I was hoping it was going to be more like Celebrity Skin but this cd is more a hard rock cd. I actaully do like this cd the first 6 songs on it are good especially Violet, Miss Worl, Plump, and Jennifer's Body. The second half of the cd really sucks. I never listen to the second half...I always stop on #6. Some people probably would disagree with that but that's just my opinioun. Something that really makes me mad is that Courtney Love can sing about suicide and abuse and curse a lot in her songs but she dosn't get explicit lyrics. If you don't like to here and eating diorders, suicide, abuse, and cursing I would advise you not to buy this cd."
5,Hole's achievment of perfection,"This is Hole's best cd.It has an incredible balance between the raw ""pretty on the inside"" and the over polished ""celebrity skin"".If you like heavier sounds you may like more of ""violet"", ""plump"", ""jennifers body"" and ""gutless"".All the songs have great lyrics ,especially ""doll parts""(one of the most beautiful and heartfelt songs ever written)and ""asking for it""(by far my favorite song in this cd).So, anyway, if you know next to nothing about Hole's work and you're going to buy only one of their cd's , definetly buy this ,cause it's Courtney Love & co on their finest moment."
1,Great Band...Bad DVD,"Don't get me wrong, EF are a fantastic band. All of their LPs are worthy of your hard-earned cash. This, however, is not. Bad video. Bad sound. Small crowd. You can only hear one guitar. And as great as these guys are, they pretty much just stand around on stage when playing. Do yourself a favor and buy How To Make A Monster or The Buzz of 1000 Volts instead."
3,I think there is a component missing,"I just purchased & received the Fellowes In-line Document Holder. It seems like a high quality document holder, and I love the adjustments, but I think the one I received is missing a component. The image on the instructions indicates that there is a adjustable support behind the document tray to lock the tray at the proper angle, but mine did not come with one. Has anyone had a similar problem?"
4,Arctic Convoys in World War II,"This is an excellent reference book for a World War II historian or anyone else interested in this area of the war. The author describes every convoy involved in the infamous ""Murmansk Run."""
5,A perfect album,"I learned of Ted Hawkins just after the release of this album, and shortly before his death. It is simply one of the best studio recordings ever, bar none. Buy this disc, learn his life story and listen to the lyrics to ""Big Things."" After 15 years of listening to it, that one song still makes me cry, every time. If I had to choose 5 albums to have on a desert island, this would be one of them."
5,One of the best albums of 1994,"The first time I heard that voice I was hooked.The song was ""Long As I Can See The Light"". Upon hearing the rest of the disc I knew I had heard nothing like this before. Every song is a classic . The vocals are the most distinctive and unique I've ever heard. I only wish I had seen Mr. Hawkins in person."
3,series getting a little tired,"I think they are running out of steam, of possible variations on the theme. How many situations can these wives/husbands get into? Sheesh!"
2,Not anywhere near as good as the first few seasons,"When I first started watching Army Wives on Netflix, I was absolutely addicted. My own husband was gone a lot for work (although not in harms' way) and I couldn't wait to watch the next episode. The season prior to this one is where this show ""jumped the shark."" Honestly, when Pam left, the show began a downward spiral and I find myself just not caring about the show anymore. I would watch it if it were free, but I just don't want to see it enough to pay for it."
3,Kinda Boring,"When I first started watching Army Wives from season 1 I could not stop...it was great....so many twists and turns, and you couldn't guess what was going to happen next.....but season 6 seemed different. It took me 2 months to watch it!! The producers seemed to run out of excitement. It felt like they were desperate for material....I lost interest. To this day, I have no idea if there is a season 7. But then again....I really don't care because it would probably be too boring."
5,<3 This series,This is one of the best series I've ever seen! I started on netflix about a month ago and I couldn't wait till this season was on netflix so I purchased from Amazon. Now I can't wait till it starts again!!
5,love army wives,my wife and I will be very sad when the show ends for good! Every thing about this tv show is great
5,Love,"I LOVE ARMY WIVES!!!!! Every season just gets better and better than the last!! Never fails to impress, love it!!"
5,I love it,"Loved ""living"" like an Army wife during the series. I could hardly stop watching and wow! what an ending. Would love to see the series continue"
3,"Not the worst, not the best","I think it gives an interesting take on a different way of living in the United States, but the show was a little ridiculous at times. While I now better understand the difficulties of military families, the show at every twist and turn would point it out in some dramatizing tears, hugs, and speeches. I think military wives are stronger than what this show protrays. These families seem weak and needy."
4,Good drama,I like the stars as I've seen them in other programs. They did a good job at making this series entertaining. I'm looking forward to watching season 7 in March '13
5,Cliffhanger,"Now I'm hooked! Been through the first six seasons on Amazon Prime.... only started watching cause our daughter got a job on the production crew. Can't wait to find out what happens next!Anyone know where I can stream it once the new season starts, so I don't have to wait for Amazon Prime to make available? (Hulu doesn't have the rights.... we have a roof antenna and stream off the internet.)The story line is somewhat predictable, the acting is sometimes wooden, but the characters are lovable and grow on you. This series has given me a great appreciation of the sacrifices made by the women and men of our armed forces. God bless them."
1,not a biblical account,"The online description indicates that the story is scriptural; it is loosely and not entirely correctly based on scripture. Numbers 21 states that in response to the people's complaints and disobedience, ""the Lord sent venomous snakes among them"". This contrasts to the Kimmel version in which the snakes were knowingly waiting for the cloud, with which God surrounded Israel, to be lifted so they could attack. Big difference between God's intention and snakes intention! Really too bad, since the story is a foreshadowing of the lifting up of Jesus on the cross to save us from our sins/eternal health and not just the first use of a snake to be associated with physical health/hippocratic oath. Perhaps there are other versions in which the snakes are supposed to have this knowledge about the Israelites?"
2,Not what was expected,"Ordered a Logitech but received a Logicool. Logicool is what is sold in Japan. The AC adpater is adaquate, but not UL approved. The ""kit"" of inserts will not satisfy the 3rd Gen NANO, but my exacto-knife was able to complete the modification (Kids - Do not use an exacto-knife without help from your parents).The sound is good, very good. The speakers are well constructed and the carry bag is an appreciated touch. I have ths same complaints that others have related to the misleading pictures showing the iPOD docking in the cradle. Instead, you must - MUST, MUST, MUST use the headphone port to get sound from the iPod to the speakers.I gave it two stars for the misleading advertisment and the fact that I received the Japanese model when I live in the US."
1,Not for Nano G3!,No adapter available for the new Nano. I bought it for my wife to use at work a there is no adapter for her iPod and the iPod must sit outside the cradle.Does not charge the iPod like the box implies. Box and product info very misleading.I am very disappointed.
3,Something for the Zune,"The Zune is a cool device, but it hasn't seen the sucess of iPod so not too many accessories are available for it. If your in the market for a zune dockable speaker system, but you don't want to spend $200 big ones, do what I did--get the Logitech mm32 Portable iPod Speaker System. Don't let the name fool you. This device was made to fit more than just the ipod. In fact my Zune fits just fine. It attaches with a standard audio jack, so other mp3 players will work too. Drawbacks, well it doesn't get too loud, and the player won't charge while docked. If you can get past those drawbacks, this is a pretty nice gadget for a room or office. It also comes with a handy carring case so you can take it on the road."
2,tell it like it is,"The first speaker I bought was great. The sound quality for such a smaill portable speaker was wonderful, especially for parties at the beach. After a year it just stopped working. I bought a another one. One month later the same thing happen again I receive a replacement, but the sound quality was weak. It did not have the same base and only worked a few months. I went through all of the trial and error steps to fix it before I gave up. I actually miss having it, but money is too hard to come by to waste again. Hopefully logitech will make a better quality speaker that plays mp3 players."
4,Very good sound quality!,"I've been looking for a good speaker for my iPod for over a year, but didn't want to spend a fortune. A friend has a similar Logitech speaker and I was on the hunt! It just so happened we were going to the mountains for the weekend and the speakers came the day before. My only problem is that my iPod is newer than the speakers and it doesn't fit any of the holders, but that does not take away from the sound quality at all. I always go to Amazon.com first when looking for just about anything. Thank you."
4,When I travel this speaker goes with me!,Logitech mm32 Portable Speaker System for iPod (Black)I never leave home without it.
3,Logitech mm32,"The Logitech sounds great but comes with no ""English"" instructions. It does not hold the IPOD 3MG (with the larger screen) very stable, but it does work. Also it does not charge the IPOD like other models do. However, it is convenient, esp. for a desk and sounds good."
2,Loud but Bad Buy,"These speakers definitely have volume, but they are far from practical. The main reason is that there is no charger built in to the speaker. In order to charge it, you have to wrap a regular Ipod charger into the bottom, pull it up, and then connect it to the Ipod. When I plug in my Ipod, I'm not trying to perform surgery. I returned this model and got the more modern Logitech. That at least has a charger. That one has its own problems, but that's for another review."
2,Chintzy design...very misleading pictures,"Based on the pictures shown on Amazon as well as Logitech's web site, one would believe the dropping your iPod into the dock charges and provides the audio connection to the speakeres. You'd be incorrect on both counts. You still have to plug into the computer to charge this thing, and there's a cable (not shown in any of the pictures) that you have to plug into the top of your iPod to make the audio connection.We returned this item and went with something by Altec Lansing in the same price range instead...we're much happier with it."
2,Not what I expected,"This set of iPod speakers was not what I was expecting. We purchased this as a gift for our daughter for Christmas. I have a different set already,for my player, that is plug and play and recharges the iPod at the same time. The description of this does not make it clear that it does neither. You have to plug in the player with a wire that fits up through the bottom of the space between the speakers, it's very awkward and does not hold the player steady. And it does not charge the player. Not worth the money or effort. Sent it back for a refund. Would not recommend."
1,Garbage,"I bought this for traveling with my iPod and had very low expectation. Should be low cost, small and not totally flimsy.The size and premise of these speakers are exactly what I was looking for. But the sound, oh the sound, is complete garbage.I wasn't expecting much, not a lot of power, and not top shelf sound definition, but these start distorting the bass at about 25% of their max output, forcing you to turn the sound way down. You can get better sound and more juice out of those $7 unpowered cheap speakers you can find anywhere. A work around is to cut off the extreme bass with EQ. but couldn't they figure that out in the design stages?If you care about sound quality do yourself a favor and skip this."
3,I-POD External Speaker system,I just received it a few days ago. The product seems to be made well and has OK features. It is not quite what I expected. I thought it would be a bit larger and have more volume capabilities. I would say the product is worth what I paid for it through Amazon.com. Other vendors have it vastly over priced for what it delivers.
5,Stellar and Stunning - One of Coltrane's Best!!,"This is a transitional time period for Coltrane and friends. I've never heard Coltrane do anything quite like the title track before and it's amazing! One wonders what the magic must've been like - to witness that in the studio - Wow! Impressive. Track 2 is an almost 10 minute opus with just Coltrane and Elvin Jones - the first grains of ""Interstellar Space"" are found right here, a year or two before... This is one of my all time favorite Coltrane albums and I'm stunned that it is not more popular than it is..."
3,Meg Wheatley leads the way again,"""Finding our Way"" continues the excellent standard that Margaret Wheatley has achieved with her previous publications. Her thinking is so clear and impactful. If only more of our leaders could raise themselves to her level, it would be a better world, with better communities and organisations, at every level.Another great read.Peter Spence"
1,A disappointing waste of money,"My son is a HUGE Star Wars fan and really liked the Jango Fett character. This was more expensive than any other costume we had ever bought for him but felt it would be worth the investment since he really enjoys dressing up and playing Star Wars with his friends.Unfortunately the helmet is very cheaply made, the costume was poorly sewn and ripped after two wearings. The back did not even have a zipper to keep it in place. We had to tie it in place like a hospital gown.Save your money on this item."
2,Misguided,"The real crime of this movie is that it attempts to portray Priscilla Zappa as someone who planted the ideas of molestation in Nicole's head. Nicole was obviously a very mentally ill girl at that moment in her life, so to give any weight to her allegations is just beyond absurd. I was fortunate enough to be a student of Ms. Zappa at Mt. Lebanon Senior High during my senior year in '96-'97, and I can say without reservation that Ms. Zappa was one of the kindest and warmest teachers I ever had. She had a great thirst for knowledge, an incredible enthusiasm about the subject matter (anthropology), and was a very open-minded woman. It is a damn shame that her reputation was sullied by this girl when all Ms. Zappa did was open her home to someone that she thought needed help."
1,Expected more!,"This CD is not what I expected, it was a gift for my husband who loves G.E. Patterson's preaching. The songs all sound the same."
3,"Slow, but good...","Singing the Old Time Way 2 is enjoyable. Most of the songs are slow, but good. I had expected more ""lively"" praise songs - but this was still inpirational."
2,Human Sex: A Concise Manual for Aliens,"I don't really know who Anne Hooper had in mind as the target market, but here is a newsflash for her: most people already know that 'boys have penises and girls have vaginas.' The book is boring - you will NOT learn anything new from it, unless you really don't know jack and need someone to explain to you what goes in where. The illustrations are hilarious - the couples look like they are about to fall asleep after an exhausting evening of playing bingo.Verdict: buy this book only and only if you are as clueless as Dick Solomon from the Third Rock."
2,UNimpressive....,"I am sorry, but I found this book to be quite disappointing, and particularly unimpressive. This book might be fine for those who are total novices, in fact it doesn't even give very concise directions, so you can't even really call it suitable even for them...And frankly, to me, the couple(s) didn't even look as if they were enjoying themselves that much! If you want a book that gives you good ideas on how to ""spice up"" your sex life, then there are plenty of others out there that fit the bill much better. Frankly, I feel that I wasted my money."
3,Lacking,"Pictures are good. It would be a good companion to the Kama Sutra (Unabridged,translated version). Needs more explanation. Lacking!"
3,Nice Little BedSide or Traveler for that Getaway,"Hooper does a great job of ""compiling"" the concepts of the KS into a little-sized ""bedside"" or travel-size version perfect for packing in your overnighter bag on that little getaway. The Artwork and photowork are very beautiful and ""Treasureful"" in harmony with an ancient text(s) yet so applicable to today and with modern photos along ancient art. It is part artwork, part manual/how to book. Also noteworthy along with its small pocket size are ""to the point"" and not too lengthy descriptions of each position or concept. It is a skimming guide if you will, and well suited to situations where it might be pulled from a pocket for a ""pocket session"" between you and your lover. Not an in depth study work but a perfect ""idea guide"" for on the spot sessions or rendezvous'. A good addition to the bedroom library."
2,Way too Basic,"This book seems to be a guide to people who know absolutely nothing about holding, kissing, caressing etc. etc. Though it does a very good job at explaining all the above but its about as useful as reading detailed instructions on how to make a sandwich, you allready know how to do it you dont need a book to tell you. Id recomend this book only if you have no idea how to make contact with the opposite sex."
3,Good Introduction to Tolstoy,"This is a good first read of Tolstoy's material. It is not nearly as long as _War and Peace_, but is still a good first exposure to the great works of Leo Tolstoy."
5,The best,"Every CD transglobal underground releases is in my opinion, pure perfection. The idea of mixing traditional music with techno is the most incredible thing I've ever come upon. This CD is everything the others are and more."
3,An ok CD,"I was a little disappointed in this CD because it was not quite as global as I had hoped. Still, it is good to listen to as I work in my studio, so I cannot complain too much."
4,Not bad at all.,I am currently in the process of modding my FG2 over the next year period until I go home. I can not do major modifications due to location however minor modding I have no problem doing away from a garage. This product is great because it makes my FG2 stand out over the others located at my current establishment. The only downside was that the price seemed a little to steep for what they are however that may just be my opinion. It was fairly simple to install. I did it during my lunch break from work because I had just gone to pick up the mail. If you have a FG2 see the pictures I added and see if it suits what your looking for.
5,The Reencuentro production is the best.,"I have been a loyal fan of Menudo since I was 6, now I am 23. I love them now as I did back then. I am so happy that they decided to come back. If you were a fan then, relive the experience by buying this wonderful CD. If you are a roocky, learn and love them and their songs just as the rest of us do."
5,Felicitaciones y agradecimiento por el disco,"Hace 15 años muchas personas vivimos experiencias jamás soñadas, ahora la vida nos da la oportunidad de repetirlas, por eso, gracias a la vida y gracias a René, Ricky, Johnny, Miguel, Charly y Ray por hacernos soñar con este disco, que sin duda nos acompañará por siempre."
5,Wonderful,"Listen to this CD was a enchanted trip to my best years. Nothing of Menudo's magic was lost. My heart still beats like when I heard them for the first time. I'm 37 years old, but this CD makes me feel like seventeen. The boys voices are more mature, but perfectly recognizable. Love it!"
3,"Alright, Could have been better!",It was pretty good but I like all of the saddle club books but what happened to being best friends and sticking together through thick and thin?
1,Blech!,"This is definitly not one of Bryant's best. She focused too much on Lisa's goodie-goodieness. Lisa is made out to be dumb, and assuming...which she is not. I think Bryant should have focused more on the good qualities of the girls- it's too early to start showing faults in the girls so early in the series. But it is an important part of the series so I recomend reading if your serious about reading all the books this is a must."
5,One of the best children's books available.,"This is one of the treasures of children's literature. My daughter chose it from the library one day and read it to me, and I was spellbound as I listened to my five year old read a story of such depth. A little boy of about six years of age remembers his grandfather who cared for him when the boy was barely out of infancy. The boy's memories are so vivid that his mother is overjoyed to discover that the grandfather, who has died, lives on through the memories of her son. A book that no one seems to know about but which my daughter and I have found to be one of the best we have read in our seven years of reading children's books together. A book that should be included on all children's reading lists."
5,Still love Janet Lambert,"In this book Tippy Parrish is off to Germany with her parents. It is very hard to leave the family at home because Davey is recuperating from polio. At first Tippy is miserable in Germany but then she begins seeing Ken, who she is falling in love with. And there there is Peter Jordan, her old boyfriend at home. In this charming story, we watch Tippy grow up, fall in love, and then face a separation from Ken as her father returns home to retire from the Army, and Ken is ordered to Korea. For those of us hooked on Janet Lambert and the Parrish family, this is a good one!"
5,Tippy is off to post WWII Germany,"I have been saving good books for my children since I was a child, much as my mother did for me. This book, in its first printing, was one such book, passed to me by my mother when I was about 13 or 14, about to be passed to my eldest. Set in the post-WWII years, this book is part of a wonderful series about two families, the Parrishes and the Jordans, who are stationed together in the Army and whose lives interweave, especially through the heroine of this book, Tippy Parrish.There are so many trite, poorly written and depressing books out for our young adults now, that I find it refreshing to offer my children books that reflect old fashioned values and ideas. Though these books have typical 50's roles for men, women and African Americans, they are none the less still topical, as they deal with how young girls grow up and fall in love. I heartily recommend all of these books!"
2,Unpleasant main character,"A friend gave me this book to read, and that's the only reason I'm still reading it. About 130 pages in, I continually find myself thinking how much I dislike Rebecca--she seems to be wallowing in various sorrows, full of self-pity, arrogant, self-absorbed and far too focused on high-end fashion.The murder hasn't engaged me, and the title device, God's autobiography, has yet to show up. I enjoy the rare appearances of the dead Polish congregation, but they're few and far between so far.I have always had difficulty enjoying books in which there's no character I can relate to, and this is one of those.I will probably finish it for my friend's sake, but I can't help but regret the time I've spent on this book so far."
3,Ham-handedly interesting.,A religious / philosophical treatise in search of a novel; not entirely unsuccessful.
1,Run away,"Literally run away from this product. They say to press down for a 1/2 second but even still this product explodes everywhere. The instructions say to lay down a drop cloth beneath the area and hang plastic around the ceiling area. What you should do is cover the entire room in plastic and that includes yourself. It exploded all over the ceiling, walls, floor and myself. It was in my hair, arms and face.When I called the company they said they stand behind your product. What you should do is stand 100 feet from their product. Oh and the end result was horrible. The ceiling looked terrible and I had to wipe the entire product off."
1,you'll be sorry,STAY AWAY FROM THIS CRAP AT ALL COSTS!! This junk sprays out uncontrollably in all directions and is BROWN! Do you like brown ceilings? I sure don't! What a mess I've got to clean up now. My advice is to scrape off your popcorn ceilings and and never go popcorn again!
2,This was the first time I'd used any ...,"This was the first time I'd used any shaving gel. In general, I didn't find the product to be that useful. I don't feel that it provided a closer shave than without using it and thus I wouldn't recommend it."
2,More like 72 pieces,"This arrived in pieces, literally. Most of the magnets had fallen off the hearts by the time it got to my door. The magnets might have been super strong, but the glue holding them together obviously wasn't. I returned them and didn't bother ordering more."
5,Thanks and God Bless,Thanks and God Bless y'all for this very much appreciated product included as Halloween Treats.
1,Biased and distorted view of history.,"Mr. Piotrowski's book shows a biased and distorted view of Ukrainian-Polish relations. The terms ""genocide"" and ""ethnic cleansing"" apply equally to Poland. The accounts of the Wolyn genocide are much exaggerated. The Ukrainians feel that it was a necessary struggle for Ukrainian independence against centuries of Polish colonialism and oppression - on the Ukrainian ethnic territory."
1,Why release this DVD in this condition?,"I don't know why such a great company would release such a terrible product! This DVD is missing the first episode of the original three volume mini-series. The first episode is depicted as a mere prologue to the remaining two episodes. The original Japanese language track is non-existant. As a good fan of the series, I was highly disappointed. Dangaioh fans stay away!"
1,Oh no they DID not!,"what was the point of releasing this piece of... well you know what i mean. why bother if you aren't going to show the first episode?! then there wouldn't be any need for a prologue that was just way to long and boring to begin with. i thought i would fall asleep before the damn thing even started. i am seriously disappointed, since i watched it a very long time ago and have been waiting forever for them to finally re-release this title. that they would do so little justice to it is just pitiful.not to mention the fact that you can't even watch it in japanese with english subtitles. although it was fun to watch it with the english dub... i don't think i can remember the last time i heard so much swearing."
3,A sad story of an adoptiom gone wrong,"After reading the book, seeing the movie and reading the reviews. I have to wonder. What were the authorities thinking. Here we have adopted parents, who went into this with good intentions. Than you have a woman, who lied several times and whoeveryone forgives for causing all this. Than there's Dan Schmit, who is lied too and forgives Cara. Okay so he made mistakes, haven't we all. This child should have been taken immediately and placed in a foster home till things were worked out. But the authorities allowed the Deboers to keep and nuture her.Now both couples are divorced and there are three children being raised by single parents. Go figure!"
4,Heart wrenching Story,This story is so so tragic. I really felt for the DeBoers. I have only read this book and know nothing of the movie or what has transpired since. I felt torn as this child was from the only parents she knew. I think Cara and Dan should have left it alone and let Jessica stay where she was. I am sure she is or seems to be okay now but the trauma that child had to bear was unnecessary. This book is really touching and makes you look at yourself and wonder what you would have done. The story is well written as Robby DeBoer writes from her prespective she does not unfairly treat Dan and Cara. Recommend this book!
1,get over it,"The little girl this book was written about is an adult now and has read this book and seen the movie and she did not like either of them. That should say a lot about quality of reading, and the acuracy of facts."
1,Crocodile Tears,"I picked up this book for free at the library, not sure what it was about. As I read the book I was slightly put-off by the author's writing style, and her sugar-coated and twee recollections of Jessica. But, like the previous reveiwer, I became more and more irritated by the author's refusal to accept her role in this tragedy. The fact that she and her husband kept Jessica from going back to the Schmidts as a baby and then argued that the girl was bonded to them as a toddler was completely and totally selfish on their part. They put their needs before Jessica's. And her self-proclaimed naivete about the media, movie deals and such was too much to believe. This book was just another opportunity to paint herself as the angel mother, and make a few bucks in the process. I'm putting my copy back on the give-away pile."
3,Clarification re multiple editions,"Note P. Sean Bramble's comment that his authorship of this book began in 2004. Amazon has scrambled his edition with what seems to be a previous edition by Rex Shelley in 1992. The images and the ""look inside"" links take you back and forth to wrong web pages... The Shelley book, which seems to be the one to avoid, is ISBN 1558680713.I will order what I hope is the Bramble book, and hope that Amazon straightens out this mess."
1,Negative!!!,"This *is* in reference to the P. Sean Bramble version. It's awful. I don't know why they would hire someone so disdainful to write a book about another culture. I find myself skimming this book just to find one comment that DOESN'T bash the Japanese. I read this book because I was excited to move to Japan and I think I am going to stop reading it because it is having the complete opposite affect on me. The author finds the need to commment endlessley on his opinions on Japan, which are 99% negative. I am reading the entertianment section now where he drones on about how much he hates Anime (um, I think most of the population disagrees with you there!) and how stupid Japanese TV shows are (as if American news is not as biased and gossipy as Japanese). Seriously, don't buy this book unless you want to be talked out of going to Japan!"
4,Sure to please many tastes,"I LOVE this album. My sister gave it to me for my birthday and I find myself constantly reaching for it when there are people over who like a variety of musical genres. This will please the jazz lover, the ""folky"", and Irish/New Age buffs. My husband and I both enjoy it and he is a classic rock listener and I tend towards alternative. (I also find most of the songs incredibly sexy. Great for a romantic night at home.)"
2,Monotonous,"I first heard this group during the closing credits of the movie ""Conviction"". Fell in love with the song ""Heaven & Hell"" and the lead singers voice. Still like the song and the voice but I found all the songs to be the same tone/tempo/speed...each one sounded so much like the one before and the one before that. I kept waiting for something to burst through but it never happened and then the CD was over and I have yet to listen again. So dissappointed, they sound like they are really capable of so much more but I just didn't hear it."
4,A must-buy for a back roads photographer / traveler.,"I use my Michigan Recreational Atlas constantly - as a record of places I photograph and for potential photo ops.As I'm leaving for PA next month to photograph the Elk herds, it seemed like a good idea to get the PA version. However, because it's high on topography, it's quite difficult to read road names and to see access info. It still is a major improvement over State fold-up maps. Not as good as a Recreational Atlas version, but still worth the $$. Delorme remains my Atlas of choice.Be forewarned, though - it may not be a fast delivery (allow plenty of time for trip starts.) The anticipated date was Sept 26 to October 5th (my trip starts on Oct 7th, so that made me nervous.) However, it was a happy day when Amazon sent me an email saying they were able to get it earlier than expected and were shipping immediately. It came on Saturday, Sept 23rd, giving me plenty of time to study the maps and mark them for day-tripping."
3,Lots of streets missing in the 10th edition,"I am looking at pg 85 of the 10th edition I received directly from Amazon and I see several important roads are missing labels. It seems like the town names take up more room in this edition, at the expense of street names. This is an unfortunate change. I might have to label some of these by hand now or search out an older edition - i think those were more comprehensive."
2,10th edition is a step in the wrong direction,"I usually find the Delorme Atalas & Gazetteers to be the most useful of maps. My old PA A&G was falling apart, so I put it in recycling and bought the newest edition. It's a bit of a disappointment. The place names are much bigger, the road lines are much thicker, and it's just generally harder to get an idea of the topography. If I wanted just a road atlas, I'd buy Rand McNally."
3,Take a hike,"I was hoping this would be as excellent as the Maine Gazeteer, but it isn't. It is a topographical map, which is fine if all you want to do is hike mountains. But if you want street names and town names better grab a magnifying glass. Tiny print and roads drawn in pastel colors is not really helpful. Disappointing."
5,Grow up with the book,When this book first came out my mom did not read Nancy Drew book but when I came around I love read her books.
3,Overall not the most horrible read :~{,"This is definitely not the best Nancy Drew book I've read (21). The characters are greatly described in the story. It feels as if I've known them. But I wish the story had more action in it like "" The ghost of Black wood Hall"". As others have said on here, Nancy doesn't play the most heroic role in this mystery.Less dangerous and exciting situations take place. There is only 2 main fatal crisis that need Nancy's fast solutions that weren't really exciting. For example:Her convertible was about to crash in the watery moat but Nancy drove backwards without a problem. Another reason I thought this mystery story was OK Was because the book described briefly history with the castle. I would of liked more history and description of the castle because the way the story describes it made me think of it as ""just a secret hideout"". But the mystery was very good ( I love the characters in this book)! And the ending is just so sweet. Over all its not a bad read"
3,This book was ok,I have read 15 Nancy Drew books so far and my favorite was: The Clue In The Broken Locket. I'd just thought I'd say that! I was really excited to read this one because of a castle and stuff and in the summary it said it was a little bit spooky. Well it was really boring and there was too much happening at the same time. The castle parts were really boring and so0o0 not exciting. And all they did was eat at that stinkin brass kettle.But some parts were good?
5,Absolutely brilliant,"I highly recommend this cd to country fans, I thoughly enjoy listening to it. Great voice, great musicians and great music, what more can you say. I highly praise all of Mark Chesnutt's work but this is great."
5,"A ""MUST BUY"" CD for all country fans old and new!","Thank you Mark Chesnutt for keeping Traditional Country Music alive! Please don't change your style of music! I'm tired of these crossover or alternative country artists that claim they're country. It's all HOGWASH BULL R&B; CRAP!!!Keep up the excellent traditional sound, Mr. Chesnutt. And thank you for lettin' me know there's still REAL MUSIC out there again!"
5,Great!,"Songs about cheatin', drinkin', and mamma make this hardcore honkytonk music not for the faint of heart. All the songs on this cd are good but standouts include the title track, Mamma's House, and Think Like a Woman. This is a must have cd for your collection if you enjoy this genre."
4,"Really, really cool","""Rock of Ages"" is the best superhero comic book story ever written. Part 5 was so good, I needed a cigarette.Grant Morrison's talent on the JLA is that he handles all of the characters better than anyone else. His Superman is very Superman. His Batman is extremely clever and competant. The Martian Manhunter is patient and wise, Wonder Woman is strong, and Green Lantern is a bit clueless but very capable. This is pure fun the way superhero comics are meant to be."
3,Too Much Stuff Going On!,"Somewhere in here there are about a dozen great ideas. Trouble is, Grant Morrison uses all of them. At once! A new, dangerous threat to the JLA is mixed with an alternate future story that didn't deserve to be linked to any other tale. Morrison loves these heroes, but he needs to slow down, just once."
4,best of the bunch!,"this was the best JLA book i've read in a long time! the plot was great and the dialuge was supurb! I dont care what people say, Grant Morrison is the best JlA writer and this book proves it! course we could use less Darkside more injustice gang. still, this book is great! dont miss it!!"
2,"Very strange, convuluted story...","JLA: Rock of Ages is the weakest modern-day JLA storyline I've come across. It has characters hopping through unidentifed spaces and times to counteract an evil we don't understand for unexplained reasons, interacting with bizarre and unnecessary characters. Maybe I missed something, but I sure didn't ""get it"" the first time. At least we got to meet Hourman for the first time..."
1,"The worst, so far...","Horrible. They're young. They're old. It's the past. It's the future. Nothing is as it seems. Nothing makes sense. It's just a bunch of garbbled trash. Poor Grant Morrison had to be under the influence of some illegal drug to actually think this mess made any sense. Stay off the dope, man. It messes up your mind. I had to force myself to finish this. It was painful, but I did it. Horrible. Awful. Please, don't waste your money. I'll tell you all you need to know... at the end they disband the JLA. Why they do is not important, because in the very next issue (JLA: Strength in Numbers) they re-group. Skip this book and go straight to ""Strength in Numbers"", which is far superior than any of the previously published JLA books (Rock of Ages, being the worse)."
2,"When Morrison is good, he's very good...","But when he tries to do this complex space opera stuff, it goes awry. The same thing that happened with JLA happened with New X-Men. By the time he got to his final story-line, it was a jumble of confused action sequences. Compare that to Morrison's Cassandra Nova stories from earlier in the series.Likewise, Morrison's first JLA story arc (New World Order) is some of the best mainstream comic book story telling I've ever seen. But by the time he got to World War III, everything was confused and jumbled again.Rock of Ages is like that as well, although it has one saving grace, the unsettling future world run by Darkeseid. he struck gold with that part of the book, but then lost it after the showdown with Darkseid.Still, I think Morrison is one of the best writers in comics. Check out his We3 series, probably one of the creepiest things he's ever done."
3,OK ... until it is used for a year,"Decent feather-bed. I decided after a year of light use I would hand it down. My 16 year old brother thinks this is the best. started to hurt my back and I decided to just buy a premium pillow-top mattress. I guess I am getting to old to have an overstuffed bed. Beware that fitted sheets don't like this all to much. The feather bed gets padded down quickly. You will be ""fluffing"" this thing everyday if you want it to be effective. Me... I would rather just get into bed after a long day of work without having to ""fluff"" my bed."
2,Like every other,This book is like everyother how to get through life books. It was more like a text book. It got a little boring and was a little stupid.
2,Copy Cat,"This book was just like all those other ""growing up books for teens"". I have to give it some credit for having information, but the text was very small and the book was kind of confusing."
2,Vague Cookie Recipes,"I bought both books ""101 Things..."" and ""101 More Things..."" and bought them mainly for the cookie recipes. I was disappointed. The recipes for the cookies are vague at best. ""Roll cookie dough into small balls""; would that be 3/4""? or 1""? Okay, so I decided I would use the yield to figure out how many cookies the batch yields then work backwards from there to figure out the size of the dough balls.... well, there's no yield in any of the cookie recipes either.You simply mix the 3 or 4 ingredients together and ""drop balls of dough onto greased cookie sheet."" The recipes sound delicious, don't get me wrong. I would think that the author has used these recipes and baked the items that she's compiled into a book and put her name on. I made the assumption that along with purchasing the book containing her recipes, I would also receive pertinent info like dough ball size and recipe yield."
3,Many of the 101 recipes are practically clones of each other,"Gee, I feel like a bully being critical of this book that so many others have praised, but. . .Many of the recipes are almost identical but have different names or the most insignificant ingredient change. For example, the old favorite ""Gooey Bars/Cake/Brownies"" recipe appears many times, albeit with different names, sometimes with nuts, sometimes without, sometimes with chocolate chips, sometimes with white chips, etc.Same thing with cookies. There is a basic recipe for making cookies out of a cake mix, and most of us have enough imagination to substitue M&M;'s for Reese's pieces, or a chocolate cake mix for a yellow for a lemon.And there are probably inadvertent ommissions such as the oven temperature.If you're an experienced cook, you will probably find this too simplistic. If you're not experienced, or not very imaginative, then you'll probably enjoy it."
5,great for kids and adults,The recipes are yummy and EASY!!!My kids can follow the instructions.This would make a great gift.
5,Absolutely excellent,Come on you know cake mixes save the day--well this book (easy read and stays open whenlaid open) you will get so many ideas and quikideas to make your desserts stand out--I loveit.
4,I liked this one,I used this one a couple of times- it is a great idea book- I actually used one of the recipe's for the cheesecake topping (chocolate) again and again for my eclair topping!
4,My sister loves this book,I got this for my sister for Christmas one year. She thought some of the recipes were darn right creative and just what she needed for all those 0.98 cent boxes of cake mix she picked up. Always fun to try something new.
5,Easy,"I just loved this book. So often we get cook books that say easy as 1 2 3 and they end up being as hard as 98 99 100!! One of the best things about the book is most of the ingredients you will have in you cabinets, no running around to speciality shops to find items you never heard of. I get more compliments when I make one of the cakes, I have more people ask me for the recipe, and when I bring a cake to a party there is never any left over. I would rather cook than bake but with this book I am baking more. I cant't say enough about it, just buy it and you will be the hit of the party.Linda"
5,101 things to do with a cake mix,"What a great book! The recipe's are so simple and make you (the cook) look like a gourmet cook! Many of the recipe's use items you already have on hand so you can take a regular cake mix and turn into a FABULOUS homemade desert. I found this book to be a great wedding gift, a ""have-to have"" book to send off to college with your college student, and easy enough for young children to make and share with pride.This book is a MUST for busy people on the go who want to make a wonderful desert without all the fuss."
3,This review is only for Kindle edition,"Kindle users - be warned that some recipes are not displayed correctly. I think it's because the recipes are in a table format. But in any case in many recipes the quantities are not lined up correctly with the ingredients. Also a table number is listed,mysteriously, as part of each recipe."
3,OK book,I love to bake but found this book to be missing some very important features. The number of servings per recipe is not included along with other important measurements. The cooking times are also way off for some of the recipes. It's a good book for creative ideas.
2,save your money,"I bought this book as a stocking stuffer for a young friend who is a novice cook. I have the ""Cake Mix Doctor"" and use it frequently for a quick, easy, and very good looking product. Wish I could say that ""101"" was the same. Directions are unclear or missing. It is easy to prop on the counter, most ingredients are easily obtainable, but spend the extra few bucks and get the ""Cake Mix Doctor"" for its completeness and a lot more recipes. My friend calls me frequently for help and rescue. If you can have one fix it easy and fast book, do not make it this one."
1,Hit and Miss,"I was really excited about this cookbook. Unfortunately, the results have been hit and miss. The directions are incomplete at best and downright frustrating at worst. Instructions like ""pour batter"" when the batter is actually as thick as biscuit dough can be very confusing...I questioned if my batter was the right consistency, double checking the instructions. The Cherry Pie-filling Cake was dry and crumbly! How is that possible with all those cherries? I am a seasoned cook and receive compliments on my baking regularly. With 2 teenagers at home I was looking for quick recipes to stay ahead of their appetites. I was hoping this cookbook would be quick and easy... it is, but the results are only adequate. P.S. I would never give this cookbook to a beginner!"
5,Amazing illustration of Karma creation and balancing,"This book offers the best illustration of the creation (in a huge way) of karma by one soul in the time of Atlantis, and the details of his subsequent lifetime(s) spent balancing that karma with that other soul.The book is a tough read.The first fifth of the book or so is very steep both in languaging and concepts offered.I think this must act as a sort of ""gateway"" to weed out all but serious students, because the book as a whole is extremely esoteric.After that first part, the book settles into a fascinating read.The book is divided into three distinct books that take place in three distinct places and times.The identity (soul) of the narrator is the common thread.If you have read this book before, but not in some time, why not pick it up again and see what it has to say to you this time around?"
4,a must have for collectors,"This, and all the crisis series, were written (and drawn) many, many years ago. Compared to what we read these days it's a completely different story.Not just some characters are not with us anymore, but the way comics were viewed was a lot different as well. Basically a lot more writing and a lot less put into the drawing quality.I do enjoy both, a good story and the way comics are drawn today. While it's hard to get a good story these days,pictures are getting better and better, and if you are selectiveyou will find some really good pieces of art/work around.About this one in particular... If you want to have a piece ofhistory, and enjoy a good story too, don't mind average drawing quality, then this is the comic for you."
4,Well Worth Picking Up,"I remember reading the ""Changewinds"" saga in three books several years back. I've never forgotten the story. The adventures of two young women in alternate universes makes for a compelling read. There are some contovesial elements including sexual identity and the very brutal treatment the girls endure during their journey. But, I do recommend the book. It's one of the few novels I remember describing in detail to a friend"
3,A sequel that fits the original,"I was reading Jack L Chalker in my mid-teens, probably 14-16 or so - that was when I had read the first book in this series.As I have been going through re-reading books, I've been picking up the missing links to flush out my trilogies. As far as the trilogy and this books place in the trilogy go, it fits in wonderfully with Chalker's story.The series as a whole is probably intended for your older, but still young adult audiences. I don't know if I, as a parent, would approve of my child reading this book before they were nearing 18.The series as a whole is set in an interesting world, but Chalker uses the world to examine moral issues beyond the battle of good and evil, and there is a lot of drugs, sex, 'potions', hypnosis, and mind control in these books. They are certainly sexually explicit... and very morally gray. At times, I was unsure if the author himself realized how gray the moral landscape of his Changewinds saga really is."
1,horrible version,"Hourman is one of my favorite characters, but this version stinks. The anatomy is all distorted and awkward, and his facial expression looks like the Creeper from the film ""Jeepers Creepers"". The more recent JSA version is 100% better looking and more fun."
1,Buyer Beware! Included a virus!,"I don't know what the heck is up? Has anyone noticed that W95.CIH.Damaged was included with this CD??? Great. I pay all this money, and now I have an (considered to Norton) ""unremovable"" virus, and that the CD was infected.Want a virus? Try this CD."
2,Broderbund program,Disappointing! Had used AGC 7 for a couple of years when somehow it started to log out during the middle of a session. I hoped upgrading to AGC Platinum 8 would elimnate the problem. Still have the same problem. Broderbund offers no solution.
1,American Greetings Creatacard Platinum 8,"This soft ware wasn't what I expected.I had been using American Greetings Creatacard 6 for a while.Both had simular art and activities.Wasn't much different,but 6 costed 10.00 less than 8.I wish I hadn't purchased it.Seller was great but I was disapointed in product."
2,Creatacard Platinum 8,"So far this is a real dud, much less then I had expected. I have used creatacard 3 plus in the past and this can't come close to being as nice as that one. Platinum 8 does not have the calender with all of the holiday capabilities. I am having trouble printing out my calender in the landscape mode. ""Forget me not"" will not appear when I turn on my computer which I miss a lot."
2,Not so good,"I'm a big fan of AG CreateaCard - version 7. Was looking forward to this one, but had to send it back. The kidPix module never worked at all. Often times when I had the program running, it would shut down without notice and I'd have to reboot my NEW system. Just didn't work for me!"
1,American Greetings Creatacard Platinum 8,05 Aug 2010 - This software is no longer supported by the manufacturer or their agents and can not be installed or reinstalled because the web site is no longer available for registering the product - which is an integral part of the installation process. I have searched the web for information regarding this problem and have come up with a bunch of people with the same complaints. This is surely a resolvable situation so why hasn't it been sorted.
1,Creatacard Platinum 8 - American Greetings,"this product was very hard to use, now I see it has been discontinued by the manufacturer, good riddance."
2,DeLorme Atlas,I am very pleased with the Ohio DeLorme Atlas I purchased. It arrived quickly and was in fine shape.
4,nice to keep in the car,"If you don't own a gazeteer for your state I would suggest buying one. It is nice to be able to take the path less traveled and these show all of the county roads, etc. It also helps if something has closed an interstate and you need to find another way."
5,Fantastic Map ...but really BIG,"This map has everything! It is easy and intuitive to navigate, it has wonderful lists of natural parks, hiking trails, bike paths, canoe trips etc. There is wonderful detail about waterways. I had originally planned to include this in a bugout bag but it is really big, probably 10 x 16 at least with a soft cover book format...it is fantastic if you want to explore your state though!"
3,Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer - Looks good...but was missing pages,"We were originally happy with our atlas, but after about two weeks of using it, we realized that several pages are missing from it. They weren't torn out...they just weren't there! A friend of ours has the same one, and it wasn't missing pages. I believe this may have been a printing error. Other than that we were happy!"
3,Ohio Gazeteer,"I guess I'm used to more detail from DeLorme, This gets the job done but I'm more accustomed to the finer detail as can be found in the Maine, Mass and N.H. additions. The topographic features are better and off road detail is better in those publications. Don't know if that's possible considering the area that's covered"
4,Best controler for an okay system.,"If you insist on using the N64, I highly recomend you stick with the official N64 controlers. I have seen and used all sorts of third party controlers, and they are all terrible.The official controler isn't great, it wears out with any heavy use (don't expect it to last more than a year). But it the best that the N64 has."
5,Not a conspiracy at all,"In fact, the evidence is out there and you just need to look for it and put it all together......Horowitz has done all the hard work for you making this reading hard to put down even for a minute.Not surprised at all at WHO involvement and coverups...and pretty much sits with the Global 2000 agenda signed off by Vance and Co....Great reading but scarry..."
5,The shocking truth!,"In Emerging Viruses we learn the truth behind AIDS and other laboratory produced viruses. Horowitz has done a great service in writing this book, and is very brave to continue to speak out in public about it. Reading his book will open your eyes and help you see where viruses come from. He speaks about vaccinations and how they are hurting everyone they attempt to help. Soon he writes we could have mass FORCED vaccinations. Three other books on the subject are very important too.The Poisoned Needle: Suppressed Facts about VaccinationThe Vaccination Myth: Courageous MD exposes the Vaccination Fraud!Vaccination Horror: An anthology of important works on vaccination pseudoscienceKeep an open mind and read!"
2,"Masterful political analysis, terrible biology","Horowitz does a great job showing what horrible things governments and corporations are capable of, either deliberately or by accident. Unfortunately, he appears to have no understanding of the biology and evolution of viruses. He just picks snippets of information out of context from the incredibly vast volume of research, in order to support his theory. If you really want to learn about the origin of emerging viruses, and what we need to worry about for the future, read Pulitzer-winning journalist Laurie Garrett's bookThe Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance. It gets the science right, with extensive references for further information on every point."
1,Title 50 Section 32 Deals with Hunting and Fishing,"The book was boor. Do not let the 5-star reviews fool you. As an example of a distortion: Title 50 of the Congressional Code of Regulations is the US Department of Wildlife and Fisheries regulations, section 32 deals with hunting and fishing issues (e.g., refuge areas).Do your homework. It took me 5 minutes to find this fact out.The truth is out there - you just have to check your facts."
5,awsome game,liked the first game and still love the second nothing has changed still fun as ever wish they would make a third one but i dont think they will
5,Great game overall,The controls are crisp the speed is good and the graphics rock. Compter AI is also good. Deffinately worth a few dollars.
5,Back From the Dead...again,"Sir Daniel Fortesque is back, after 500 years of peaceful slumber. The game plays much like the first one, with some cool new moves such as the dan-hand where you take your skull off and place it in you hand and use it to see around corners, down holes and over ledges. The puzzles seem harder this time around, but not too hard where you get frustrated, and the overall feel of the game is very in tune to the more contemporary setting. If you played the first one and enjoyed it, or are a die hard Sir Dan Fan, this game does not disappoint. Long Live Sir Dan!"
2,This game was not worth the money...The first Medievil was 100 times better,"Okay so if you played the first Medievil game you will notice the difference in overall actions and screen panning difficulties this game has. I notice that when trying to kill a zombie or are being surrounded by a few of them you have to run, dash around and swipe them with your sword and this gets annoying because the sword isnt soo quick or swift this time which can result to your life gauge being eaten up so quick. Which brings me to my only positive remark about this game is that when you go to refill your life gauge it is quicker than before. This game isnt worth the money and the levels aren't near as fun as from the first medievil game.Sincerely,an honest reviewer"
4,"Very complex, but very entertaining.","Graphics: 7/10 - A bit unclear in places but you can definitely see how much effort when into making these creatures look fabulous and making the towns look realistic.Sound: 9/10 - The best thing about this game! The sound is thunderous and fabulous, it literally takes you into the times of MediEvil!Value: 7/10 - You won't play this game much if you not really willing to be very strategic, but it's definitely worth the money for a few weeks entertainment.Overall: 7/10 - MediEvil 2 is intelligent, entertaining and is put together nicely, it's very worth playing but only if you have the time to solve all the complex problems."
4,good game,This was a good game even with some of the problems. The two main proplems are the lenght and camera angals. The pros of this game are the weapons and the puzzles.
2,really disappointing,"Medievil 2. I imangined this to be as good as its prolouge. Sadly, the serial fell from awesome to bad. The game lacks a good story. Also, they changed almost every single voice is changed from MediEvil 1. However, if you have NEVER played MediEvil number 1, the game probally won't be as bad.I would reccomend the first game. I almost wonder if the same COMPANY made it."
4,A GREAT GAME IF YOU DON'T HAVE A MOD CHIP,"The original MidEvil was a great game, and MidEvil II was just as good. The additions of features such as the Danhand and Dankerstein was a welcomed addition. However, if you wanted to power back up you was not allowed to go back to previous level's life fountain; they were all dried up. Also if you had a Mod Chip installed in your system, MidEvil II was not allow you to finish."
4,No Girls allowed,Elizabeth was good friend with Todd. But they were not become good friend. Though Elizabeth and Eva are back the team. So they become good friend again. I think good.
4,It's a nice book,"Boys are silly!! I'm sure Elizabeth and Eva get angly. Todd braves. So he was teased about Elizabeth by his boy friend, but he became a good friend, Elizabeth again."
1,Buyer BEWARE!!,"From the sounds of other reviewers I must be one of the lucky ones! My FP202L lasted one year, to the date of purchase. The fuse is apparently located in such a place that I would have to be a world class Neurosurgeon to replace it! A TOTAL WASTE OF OVER $200!!!!!"
2,didn't last,I too LOVED this machine for the two months it worked. After two months it wouldn't heat anymore. The manufacturer was willing to repair but it would cost almost $100 to get it shipped to them DHL and another $35 they charge to ship it back. (saving the original box would have cut my cost to ship it to them by about $20). That would almost pay for a new one. I will look for a different brand this time.
1,DON'T PURCHASE!!!,"ASIN: BOOOPSP15GI too loved the steam press at first! Then as posted on another review I went to turn it on and it didn't heat up. Of course the seller(unbeatable sale, inc.) couldn't help, and the manufac. does want us to pay shipping! Which is nuts! Do not buy this product it doesn't last. It is putting $200.00 in the trash!"
1,i don't recommend it,"I buy the yamata Fammily Press 202L 1600W of 32x10 and this accent of working to work to the 3 months of use, he no longer lit but, contact to the company but they didn't assist me, they don't give support neither he helps some, I lost my money since C. I lived in Guatemala city C.A. and very expensive era the cost of reshipment refund.I don't recommend it."
3,"it's a compilation, what did i expect?","i'm pretty much agreeing with what the other people said... it's a rather poppy compilation of some somewhat popular bands.Nirvana's was great, hole's, sonic youth's, beck's were alright.a few other songs stuck out for me, like Grunge Couple by that dog. i've never heard anything from that dog. and they sound alright.i wouldn't recommend this album, i'd buy the separate albums by the bands you're interested in. unless you dig all these bands."
4,"Good sampling of some obscure, early 90's alternative music","Like many others, I bought this because of the Counting Crows single, but there are many good tracks on this CD. ""The Allegory"" was a surprisingly good song."
4,I'm not cool enough for this cd,"Hello. How did you find your way here? you obviously misspelled something and then accidentally clicked on this link. You should take this as a euphoric moment of discovery. Songs your friends who always top you with songs by bands you know and have never heard of before are on this cd. Your climb up the social totem pole will be aided greatly by this cd. If that doesn't interest you then get it for the Nirvana track which is neat. But more than that get it for the Sundays track which is as good as the only other two Sunday songs you know: ""Summertime"" and ""Here's Where the Story Ends."" I would give it five stars but Hole is on it. I don't know who she slept with to get on this album."
2,"Good cd, if you're willing to buy it for just one song.","Bought this one solely for Einstien on the Beach (Counting Crows), and that's pretty much all I got out of it. But if you're really a fan of a band on this album, it's worth getting. If nothing else, you'll look like you really know your music when you get to say, ""So you think you're a ___________ (Fill in the blank) fan, huh? Well have you ever heard---,"" and the other person invariably says no. That's when you get to show them up with an obscure song off this cd. It's actually a satisfying feeling."
2,Holds few gifts,"I suppose if one is nostalgic for the early alternative days this compilation could help refresh your memory, but in retrospect there is not too much on this disc that justifies examination now. I remember when this came out everyone was excited to hear a Nirvana B-side, only to be bitterly gypped with Nevermind's ""Stay Away"" carbon copy. It is nice to see a few tracks highlight bands in their prime like Weezer and Counting Crows, but most other big name tracks either simply get by or disappoint with blatant throwaways while the lesser known artists often attempt something memorable though usually come off as third-rate renditions of someone else or just generically ""alternative""."
4,"Great compiliation to have, especially if you got it when it came out","There are highs and lows - you'd expect by the names that this would be a blowout album. Though I was blown away at first listen, that's not fair to pin on any rarity comp disc. I've seen many in my day and quite frankly this one shows a lot of promise and history has delivered. I am biased because I've owned this disc since it came out. That said, it beats most soundtracks - a hard thing to do. At this point I think the bragging rights on this one lie with how long you've owned it. A piece of history."
4,A really great mix album,"I bought this cd for the songs by The Posies and Weezer. To my surprise most of the other songs lived up to the expectation I had placed on the before mentioned. There were only four let downs, but I always skip them. It is an ablum worth getting for you obessed fans who can not get enough of a particular band."
3,This CD is good,"This CD is good if you want to hear special songs from your favorite artists. Because these songs are rarities, you are not going to hear them anywhere else and it would be a shame to miss out on them. The songs from Hole, Beck, Sonic Youth and Weezer makes the album worth buying, even if you don't know the other artists. If you are buying this to hear ""Pay to Play"" then you should be warned that it is just like ""Stay Away"" but with slightly different lyrics. All in all, this CD is really good if you are sick of listening to the same overplayed songs again and again."
3,This is a pretty good cd,"The only reason I bought this cd was for the Counting Crows song ""Einstein on the Beach,"" but I was pleasantly surprised with the other songs on it and would reccomend it to fans of any of the bands on this cd."
5,Hit the turf running!! By David,"Madden 06This is an awesome game! Madden has so many newGame modes. Franchise, online are some of the new modes just to name a few. I highly recommend this for football fans. This game even has a demo. It has players like Ben Rothenberg, Peyton Manning, and Jerome Betties. The game Madden has historic teams like 96 Falcons, 89 Steelers and teams other teams like Fire. Without a doubt. This is a great game.This game teaches you a great deal about football. Any middle school student thinking of playing football in school could learn a great deal about strategy. This game is only $29.99 and its worth every penny."
4,Great game!! except for...,"This is a fun game, the only thig i can say is that i wish PS2 or sony could have a web site where you can download the current rosters, and the next seasons games. It kinda sucks, if i want to play next season i guess i will have to go out and buy madden 2007 with updated rosters."
2,Poorly Done,"For the most part, the gameplay wasn't touched in this game. So if you've played NCAA 06 (which has a FANTASTIC running game), going back to Madden's is a big step backwards. NCAA is alot more fluid, realistic and -- most importantly -- FUN!They have added updates that nobody wants. QB Visions is poorly executed. The joystick is too sensitive, making it nearly impossible to pick up the game and play it right out of the box.Nothing much was added to Franchise. There is a new 'NFL Superstar' mode, which seems pretty cheezy. It's mostly you just reading emails and newspapers in between games...fun right?EA needs to quit adding new features and focus on the overall gameplay. Madden 06 just isn't fun to play. Maybe that's because it still feels like Madden 2003, except with more difficult controls this time around.Sadly, there are no other options for NFL games this year (thanks to the monopoly EA has with the league). If you want a good football fix that's FUN TO PLAY, pick up NCAA 06."
3,Dissapointed,"While overal this is a good game their are some major things that I dislike. The new QB Vision mode is a fantastic idea, it falls drastically short of its promise. It makes overcompinsates for the unrealsim of former products. You are sacked way to much and it is way to easy to throw an interception. Another problem is that there are no changes at all in the franchise mode. The only difference from last year is updated rosters. I was also very annoyed that it bought a license to prevent future ESPN football games which were alway superior to EA games. While good overall it was a dissapointment."
2,RUINED,"I don't understand why EA would completely change their passing system. Maybe because they have no competition they feel like they can mess the game up and increase the price. If it ain't broke don't fix it.The passing cone is slow, the defense knows exactly where the ball is going, and it's just a pain in the butt. Who would want the offense to be more difficult? If you have a bad qb just make the ratings worse, don't make it impossible to throw the ball. Best of all you can't turn it off to play online.Also little changes like switching the defensive players and speed burst buttons are an unneeded pain. Good job ruining the best game ever. Honestly, if it was exactly like 05 with updated rosters, and improved online play I would have been happier and probably given it 5 stars."
1,Bring Back ESPN,"I've never liked the Madden series and I used to not like the 2k Series. I was stuck playin NFL Fever on Xbox. Then when that got bought out, I went to ESPN and fell in love with the 2k5 Version. Then EA sports did something that flat out should be illegal. Isnt that a monopoly or whatever? ESPN 2k5 will be the game I continue to play until EAs contract runs out. ESPN is smoother, more realistic, and just quite frankly a more fun game to play. Instead of $50 dollars on this POS, spend @20 on ESPN 2K5."
2,Madden 2006 dissapointment,I personally am a madden fan since 2000. Madden 2006 is a true dissapointment. Very simple changes from 2005. Truck Hit? Truck Hit? Couldnt they just name it Big Momma hit. I feel like I am being forced to use the joysticks when I am used to the old style directional pad. The graphics appear to be worse sometimes.(2004 style) I guess we are all expecting great abnormal changes and all we get is the same game with a few changes. I guess if you are a true madden fan you must own a copy but the only reason why I wont return this game is because of the yearly tournaments we have for madden. All I can say is that we all hope madden and EA shape up and bring something worth it for 2007. Maybe a live halftime show with real cheerleaders or the owners walking around the feild like Jerry Jones does. SOMETHING never seen before like ESPN did with ESPN 05. Like I said if you are a madden fan then you know you have to get it if not then 2005 or ESPN will do just fine for you...
4,Game Day,This is a great action game that is real fun to play on game day. I like to wake up on Sunday morning eat breakfast and then go and play my game using the teams that will be playing that day. I would recomend it for everyone.
3,2005 anyone?,"I agree with some of these reviews. The new QB system is new, cool, and different...and yes I'm also happy it can be turned off. They had some good ideas with the superstar mode, but it was sorry in presentation and makes no sense. It was poorly executed. Another thing that bothered me is that my team's (Bengals) uniforms have been screwed up for the second straight season. In 2005 they used the Broncos type of number. This year it is a simple block number unless you use the all black or orange option. If you are going to charge $50 and not add much from the previous year, do your homework and at least get the uniforms right. Game presentation and voiceovers are the same from last year along with the fan responses. I'm glad I rented this game instead of buying it. Would have been a waste of $50 to buy the same game twice. Better luck next year EA."
4,Passing mode is over-rated.,"Madden was making a big deal out of their new passing mode. It stinks. The Truck stick, which lets you plow over defenders is very cool, and the game gets a 4. All in all, if your sick of the defense always stopping you, buy this game (like you have a choice, now that EA has an exclusive license from the NFL). Oh, & if you ask me, Madden needs to ""Revolutionize"" their music. I AM SO SICK OF LISTENING TO RAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A Basic Review of Madden '06,"first off madden took the new passing feature to far. Its not a big upgrade and in 05 you could do the same thing with just a bit less control. The truck stick is a nice addition, making a nice opposite to the hit stick. The qb vision line makes it very hard to look off from your first reciever, you just don't have that much time. There aren't any big upgrades in the off-season but thats okay. This game is much harder to learn compared to the prior maddens. Especially for younger children. Overall it still is a decent game but some will not like the new features and will complain about the price."
3,Madden 2005 with a few changes,"This Game is not worth $50.00. Madden has gotton worse and worse over the last 2 years. I was a huge Madden fan, but last year I didn't buy the game (I rent before buy) because I thought all the changes that were made where for the worse. This year is no different they should have named the game Madden 2005 with a few changes. It has two different features and they both suck the special view isn't very good. I enjoyed ESPN and wish it was still here a better game for a much cheaper price. Don't buy this game you will not be pleased."
4,WOW,"PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY SAYIING THIS IS SHAPING UP TO BE THE BEST GAME...THAT'S WEIRD FROM WHA I HEAR IN IGN, THEY SAY THIS GAME HAS TAKEN A STEP BACK...I JUST HOPE THEY DIDN'T ELIMINATE THE COMPITION SO THEY CAN GET LAZY, IF THAT'S TRUE THEN ALL OF US FOOTBALL FANS ARE IN FOR SOME DEEP SHIZNIT"
5,MADDEN STRIKES AGAIN,Ive been a Madden fan since the Awesome Madden 04. I was happy with 05 and i am extremely happy with Madden 06. The new Qb Vision is a great aspect and it is easier than it looks. IT is AN awesome Game and is a must have For any Sports fan and i definately recommend.
2,"Same Old Madden, New $50.","Do you have Madden 2005? If yes then do not buy this game. Own Madden 2004? Yes? Do not buy this game. EA actually takes a step backward with this addition of Madden as far as authenticity goes. QB vision and superstar mode, the 2 big additions to this year's version are not significant to warrant another $50. They will just bog down your system & make loading times, always a weak point in EA's titles, even longer. Stick with Madden 2005 or 2004 if you have them. Nothing has changed since then & they play every bit as good as Madden 2006."
1,"another year, another bad Madden....","I waited on-line at midnight to get this Madden. I tweaked the rosters, adjusted the players' numbers, then started playing. The best thing one can say about the QB Vision control is that you can immediately turn it off. Too bad every time on defense you have to watch the computer use it. This Madden is a clone of last year's Madden besides the stupid Superstar mode (and the useless QB Vision), which you might never even play because everyone knows Franchise is where it's at. Oh yeah even the repetitive Tony Bruno is back to ensure you hit the mute button every time you go to your roster. NCAA for the last two years is so much better than Madden it's not even debatable. They fixed the small problems in last year's NCAA (but added the equally useless Race for the Heisman), and all I can say is: play NCAA, then play Madden....then you, like I did, will be placing your Madden on ebay soon afterwards."
3,I love it,"Hey guys, this a pretty good buy. The one thing I dint like about it was that some of the players were not diligent in how they played the game vrs. real life if they wasnt real diligent. This quote basically sums up the game. ""Grief can take care of itself, but to get the full value of a joy you must have somebody to divide it with."" I thnk its good."
2,Stupido!,"Im sorta mad... Why did ea have to buy the frikken license? All they did was get lazy and decide to get rid of the BETTER competition. I like madden, but this is just pathetic, Ea is a bunch of lazy bums who hate competition."
2,"EA sucks, ESPN much better","Hey guys its yet another madden title. the same as 05? 04? 03? yep. EA makes the same crap over and over. ESPN sold better then Madden last year becuase 1. it was a better game, also was rated higher in 75% of ratings. better graphics and acurate models. Madden is lame and EA is a retarded game maker. All EA games are bad, and cheap. Get ESPN 05 becuase its better then this lame title. Why spend 50$ on the EXACT same damn game as the other years?"
4,"DON'T LISTEN TO ""BRIAN FORRESTER""!!!!!!!!!!!!","I own Madden 2006 and I came on to see what other people had to say, the first review I read was by ""Brian Forrester"". After reading it all I have to say is B.S.!!!!! I don't know what that dudes deal is but he couldn't have been more wrong with his review. Almost everything he said in his review was wrong. In his review he stated that '06 was the same game as '05 but with different rosters and player ratings. I have no clue how he can justify that considering they added a whole new NFL Soperstar mode (which by the way kicks ass) TH Madden '06 is a great game."
3,No better than 2005!!!!!,"Basically the game play and graphics are equivalent to 2005. The quarterback vision mode is terrible. Who has time to hit ten buttons when the blitz is on????? The rosters, playbook, and additional defensive/offensive controls are cool. I really expected a lot more. At least better graphics would have been nice. Overall, very disappointed..."
3,ok but could be better,"for those of us that had the privilage of using the espn game series these games are lossing a lotthe grafics are ok, still the 2005 espn was better, but some new things are neat. the qb view is nice, but really doesnt improve the game,so if there is a 2k5 out there gete it."
3,Doesn't impress too much,"I like the 05 version better. Sure this has updated playing rosters and the new quarterback function, but it doesn't appear to me EA sports have evolved much over the last 12 months or even few years for that matter. I was expecting the graphics to be better and the gameplay to feel more real but maybe I was expecting too much. I won't buy the 07 when it comes out, I'll wait and see what they can do with it on Playstation 3."
2,Madden Plays The Coward,"I'm not really here to comment on Madden's game, but from what I here it's not all that great. I just want to comment on what the person under me said ""the best football game this year"". Hey dumb*ss, it's the only football game this year! Madden played the coward this year by buying all of the NFLPA credits, so they wouldn't get overtaken by ESPN's NFL 2K6(ESPN 2K5 is a far better game than Madden 2005, *check out my review on it*). They knew that ESPN's game had been creeping up on them for years and would finally pass them up on sales this year. But, the p*ssy Madden owners were too scared to allow that. So they bought up the credits and put out an exact replica of Madden 2005 (Madden 2006). The only difference is the Accurate Passing. I heard it's not that great. What's a matter EA Sports? Can't take a little competition? Isn't that what football's all about?"
4,Madden 2007,"Hey, I just caught a preview of Madden '07.Minicamp is back.You have to run the 40 and do the strength test (among others) to create a player... pretty cool.The new graphics look AWESOME!! BUT... the game creator was talking about how they prioritized the running game, trying to make it less frustrating.Funny thing is, the guy demonstrating the game was clearly getting very frustrated and he couldn't get a run longer than 2 yards... LOL...Another addition to Madden '07 is the option to be players other than the one with the ball. The EA guy said they did this so that the 'user' can take control of the lead blocker... again, to prevent frustration. But he never answered the question if you can re-take control of the ball carrier once you clear the lead block."
5,excelente!!,quede muy contento con la adquisicion de esta guitarra DEAN es un modelo muy bonito y la guitarra es de excelente calidad!!
2,high school level textbook,"I suppose nobody is going to buy this book unless they have to, so there is not much point to reviewing it. My girlfriend took the course. I looked at the book and was disappointed. Paralegal classes are generally at least junior college level. Except for the cases, statutes, etc., the book is on a high school civics textbook level, sort of patronizing, as if the author expected junior college students to be dumb. It's superficial, not particularly informative, and on some points, inaccurate. I'm not impressed."
5,Excellent textbook for anyone who is interested in law,"From all books I have ever used in school on the subject of law, ""Introduction to Law"" is the most accessible and easy to understand. It covers all major points in plain and simple language. I usually come back to this book when I need a clear simple definition or an explanation of a concept. It is a great resource for anyone who is interested in paralegal studies. I have seen many students who are very much confused when it comes to U.S. court system (federal and state), 'Introduction to Law' does a good job explaining the system and drawing parallels and demonstrating connections between federal and state systems.Every chapter of this textbook includes the relative cases and ethical choices scenarios that introduce students to possible and most likely to occur real life scenarios."
3,Good content; needs a thorough copy edit and layout change,"The content of this book was informative and relevant - I used it for an American Jurisprudence class and learned quite a bit.The layout and production value, however, were awful. There were many typos; a call-out box would interrupt a section in mid-sentence and the other half of the sentence would be several pages ahead. This issues were incredibly distracting from trying to learn the material. Maybe this does not bother other people as much as it bothers me, but the weak production is why I rated this book as a 3. This book needs a heavy copy edit and revised layout.Also, why were citations not in Bluebook, or at least some kind of standard format? Most people using this book are using for an introductory class to the law, so seeing properly formatted citations would have teaching value to people new to the legal field."
5,one of the best albums from the 90's,this album gets everything right. it's an all time favorite of mine. it grabs hold of you and never lets go. it's pop-punk perfection. it's a very sexy piece of music as well. in the 40 minutes this plays you'll get more hooks than you can shake a stick at. my favs here are Waking Up & Never Here. but really there isn't a bad track anywhere to be found. great from start to finish.
4,Now this is punk !,"Man ! These girls really kick major butt. You will fall easily into their groove as their tunes are pretty accesible and cool. This is fun music, nothing else, but it's very interesting. Elastica is a great band, but they must release another record before everyone forget what they did with this one. A great record to sing along."
1,awful,This c-d was very badly scratched. I could not listen to songs 7-11. I tried contacting the owner about a refund. They never responded. Terrible!
3,Perfectly good 90s music,"As has been noted in nearly every published review of this CD, and as even a superficial listen to it bears out, Elastica was influenced by Wire. To complain about this, however, is like complaining that The Rolling Stones were influenced by Chuck Berry, that Interpol were influenced by Joy Division, or that REM were influenced by The Velvet Underground, The Byrds, and Big Star. Music is a continuum, an evolving dialog with listeners. That Elastica use Wire as a starting point is perfectly fine with me! Our heroine's troubles with heroin meant that her muse was killed as quickly as it came, but she left behind a very nice monument to the sounds of agitated punk girl group rock - circa mid 1990s (now approaching two decades old). No, it's not groundbreaking or original, but it is good. If any of the foregoing review interests you, check this CD out. If not, you'll survive if you pass it by."
3,A DOCTOR'S LOYALTY TO HIS CRAZY WIFE,"Dr. Carlisle was loyal to the end to his crazy wife. Sometimes he struggled to stay loyal to her and to help her with her condition. I was disappointed that he did stay with her until the end. I felt he should have divorced her. Even though I do believe in loyalty to your spouse, in Dr. Carlisle's situation, he had had enough, and he needed to free himself of that crazy, ungrateful woman. I also was disappointed because he did not report the death she caused - he saved her. This book was a bit drawn out, and the same story could have been told on half, or at the very most three quarters of the amount of pages."
2,Defective Pixels,"It is a just-so-so laptop. The keyboard is not as good as IBM Thnkpad T40. The worst thing is that if you order from Lenovo you may receive a laptop with defective pixels. Lenovo will not repair or replace it unless you have more than five dead pixels. Return is subject to 15% restocking fee. Horrible customer service! Rude representative!I bought tens of desktop and laptop computers from dell and never got any LCD display with a single dead pixel. However, my first purchase from lenovo (X61) ended up with a LCD display with dead pixels."
3,A Good Riddim,"The ""StripTease"" Riddim is another decent Riddim from Big Yard productions. The are also known for the ""Salsa"" and ""Hey Sexy Lady"" Riddims. Of course Kartel and Killa are going to kill any track that they are on. I am plesed with this Riddim. A must have for any party."
4,Fits the mood of the movies perfectly!,"The soundtrack is just as good-natured, straightforward and sentimental as the movies. I would not call that serious music, but LaBoum is not a serious film. It takes talent to do light comedy well."
3,Cute sandal,"It is cute, however the strap is so long that it is not easy to keep on. Normally, staps are not that generous unless it is a wide size."
1,I would give it less than one star if I could,"I bought one of these for my mom--Mother's Day present. She loved it. A few months later I learned that a stone had fallen out of it. Too late to return it to Amazon, so I bought her another one. The very same day I gave it to her, the exact same stone had fallen out and was lost. These rings are cute but the fact that the same stone falls out with minimal wear tells me they are not well put together.I have purchased inexpensive rings from Amazon before and never had this problem."
3,interesting but not up to date and quite elementary,"Interesting book to get a historical review of deco algorithms, but you won't find up to date information. The mathematical side of the algorithms is not discussed, and thus this book will not satisfy those who seek in-depth understanding of decompression models. Good value for the beginner, quite frustrating for the trained diver."
2,Too simplistic in most respects to be of value,"Bret Gilliam published an excellent book called Mixed Gas Diving (no longer in print). After reading it, I purchased this book in hopes that updated information concerning mixed gasses and decompression models would be discussed. Much of this book is basic OW information with the history of dive tables and a discussion of profiles which have indicated an increased risk of DCS. Very little here for Technical Diving, except an overabundance of warnings about diving beyond 100' (which is well within the range of even basic OW cert). I had hoped for information for those of us who understand the risks and pursue depth as a means of exploring wrecks and caves that the rest of the world never sees. Good Intro to diving to 100'or so, not very informative beyond that."
5,"Great, must have one, from basic to technical divers !!!!!","it cover everything you (especially novice divers)want to ask about deco, equipment organization, theory, DCI, tips and techniques from down line using and mounting to decompression positioning, i found it excellent and recommend to wreck and technical divers, and for those qho want to know more about diving...."
3,a bit out of date,"when I bought this book (some years back) I would have given it 5 stars, but all deco info is now very out of date, check dive computers reviewed on index page! otherwise a very god book that is an easy read. For more up to date info check Technical Diving in Depth (Bruce R Weinke) this has every thing you might want to know but is very technical and not (I find) an easy read."
2,Boxing gloves,"The Amber Ultimate pro bag gloves are made of good quality, however the fit is akward, and my hand hurts when I punch with it (not due to improper punching), prob due to undersized fit. I did order an xl, but it seems like the gloves are just not made to fit the hands very well..."
1,False Advertising,"This Company is showing the N64 Controller in their Picture, but what i received was a knockoff. They send me a SharkPad Pro 64, which has the shorter Handles . I have to say that i am very dissappointed!!!!!"
4,Pretty.....,It is very nice. Better that all the other controls we broke by power sliding a bit too much playing Mario Cart. Nintendo charges a bit too much for it but at least I'm happy with it. If it were cheaper I surely would have given it 5 stars!
5,Great Controller,Self Explanatory. Nintendo makes great stuff. Never buy the cheap imitations. They're crap. This stuff is great!!!
5,sweet sweet session,this game takes hawdcaw skating to the next level! where did it come from? the makers of this game are probably all millionaires now livin on their own islands in the south pacific. this game has the best skaters and the best soundtrack in a game eva...booya!
5,Grind Sesson better than Tony Hawk?,"Of course it being a new game you usually think it is alredy a better game. But Grind Sesson is more than a new game. With the old Tony Hawk you had ""competions"" at any old level. In this you're actuallt at a Vans Triple Crown Park and go through the real challenges like vert, street, and best trick. Tony Hawk wasn't that in depth. The custom skater could be a little better but graphics, and the real pro sk8ers are things that kepp the game good. Unforunately Tony 2 will blow away Grind Sesson but this is still a good game."
3,Good Enough,"OK, they did a good job. THPS raised the anty, but come on! This game does the job. Enjoyable, and Re-Playable. Start a genre collection with this one second to THPS. It will feed the craving until PS2!"
3,It's alright....,"Yeah it's pretty fun, but I think THPS is still better. When I rented it I didn't play it much though. The graphics to this game could have been a lot better, they were pretty glitchy and grainy, the courses are pretty lame, nothing really inovative at all. And after I played a demo of THPS 2 which is coming this August, I knew I would rather wait for that, then buy this one. In fact I had a heck of a lot more fun with that demo than this entire game. The one thing that stood out from the rest of the skating games was the soundtrack, they did a very good job on that.Good game, nothing great though. Only buy if your a die hard skater fan.."
3,NotVeryGood,"Grind session is not a very good game. If you are going to buy a skateing game, you should buy one of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater games.Grind session has 5 playable characters, about 10 levels, and lots of secret characters.on each level, you have to do tricks to get pro points, which you use to unlock other levels. there are also objects you can break to earn extra pro points. there are also 2 contest levels.when you do alot of harder tricks, you can fill up a meter that makes your guy move faster. also it makes him spin easier."
2,poor man's tony hawk!! boo yah,"I played the demo version of this game off this cd I got in the mail one day. ...The skaters look like they just ate too much at Waffle House, and the tricks resemble skating from the early 80's. I wouldn't waste my time or money on it, even from the free demo disc. After playing this game for about 40 minutes I threw it into the cat's litter box."
2,Grind Session Is VERY Dissapointing - Stick With Tony Hawk!,"Grind Session is a rip-off of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Grind Session's gameplay resembles THPS enormously! Grind Session might have been much less of a dissapointment if it was released after Street Sk8er and before THPS, but sadly it was released just too late. BOTTOM LINE: This game might pass for a decent blockbuster rental but nothing more. Don't spend a dime on this title! Wait for Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2!"
2,I dont get what all the hype is about,its alright but defenatly not as good as tony hawk i thought that the graphocs arnt that good but the movments are ok and the buttons dont somtime dont respond and also if you think about it when tony hawk comes out and you get it youll never play it again so my sugjestion is just go out and get the demo and just play that or rent grind sesion a few times
5,By TJ Wiesner,"Its such an awesome game with its 9 levels. It has lots of glass to break through. Photo shoots,8 awesome pros. you even get to go to the Slam City Jam where you can pull off 1080's on their halfpipe. I loved this game its the most awesome game ever it even beats Tony Hawks Pro Skater!!!"
4,Good Game,"This is a great game overall. One thing I liked better about Grind Session than I did Tony Hawk was that it's easier to land your tricks, the game always lands you wheels down so you can have a lot more fun worrying about playing the game and not trying to land. I've heard some complaints about the graphics, but for me they worked just fine, not overly flashly, kind of gritty and real, like skateboarding is. The only drawback is that there is no two player Graffiti game, but hey if they added that then the game would definitely be a Tony Hawk rip-off. Other than that, this is loads of fun and it's got great replay value."
3,Ok,"I bought this CD because it had one song on it that I liked (My Hawaii). It's very hard to find, so that alone made it worth it, but I didn't really care for the other songs on this CD."
4,Great buy,"Its definitely a good buy for its price. You can see clearly through them. The cushion around the eye part fell off after the first use, but it still fit comfortably."
5,Awesome Goggles <3,"These goggles are great so far. I just got them out of the mailbox. They fit over my glasses great (and I have large glasses) and no one on the outside can see my eyes though them. I can bearly even see the biohazard symbol on the front through the lenses when I'm wearing them even though the people on the outside can see them clearly.They came in the mail one day before Amazon . com said that they would and they were pretty cheap! The straps feel good but the goggles push my glasses into my face kinda tightly even though I loosened the straps. You can't really see to the sides of you, though, withought turning your head because of the goggles.They look really good, though, and I'm glad I bought them!"
4,Nice oversized,"These goggles are nice and bigger than I thought. You can see through the biohazard symbol no problem. The adjustable strap works great. I was even able to wear these over my glasses, although the piece that connects the lenses presses into my frames a little bit, I loosened the strap so that it is ok for periods of time while wearing both. They look cool and I like them. Plus they are 400UV rated apparently."
4,glass and foam,"I wore these goggles around when it was about 20 degrees outside, they are made with about 2mm dense foam, then 7mm sponge foam. the sweat from my forehead caused the foam sections to separate. you have to tighten the adjustable strap quite a bit to get the goggle ends to touch your temples, unless you have a flat face. this may be caused by having a very sheltered life where i can't flex the plastic too often. the glass is high quality, use a very soft cotton/fabric to clean the lenses off, they shine magnificently, god help you if you have greasy fingers. I wore them to go running in, 32 degrees, improvised ski goggles, no strap problems, but they get FOGGY! You can barely see the design from the inside, even if you take them off and look at the inside. quality thick plastic without epoxy/glue/rubber cement drips. great for the price/present"
3,Goggles,These goggles are real cool for such a low price. Goggles usually go for 40 and over. The only problem is they don't adjust well and are tight fitting.
5,xD love,no clue why i got them but there just so cool im sure ill have a use for them at some point furter down the road <3
5,"nirvana sucks, nirvana unplugged rules","i always hated nirvana, they're too bland, but i always liked their unplugged stuff because it was full of real emotion."
3,It's acoustic and has no energy,"Those may have seen my other reviews and I said that anything by Nirvana is good. Well this is the exception. What the feck are doing and Unplugged album for? Come As You Are, About A Girl and On A Plain just sound flat compared to the elctric versions. Only buy this if your desperately struggling to complete your Nirvana collection"
5,wonderful,"in my opinion, i would rather listen to unplugged in new york over any of the nirvana albums, 9 times out of 10. although i am a nirvana fan, i feel that most of their popular songs are greatly overrated, and their greatest songs most common people have never heard of. what's so beautiful about this performance is that it showcases the true talent nirvana has/had. even if you don't like nirvana, you would probably like at least some of the songs played here, unless you had some sort of raging hate for them or something.ALL of the covers are as good, if not better, than the performances by the original artists, and have a different, original sound to them as well. i am a big david bowie fan but can't decide which version of ""the man who sold the world"" i like better, and i truly appreciated it.i think i have listened to this cd every single day for the past 2 years. its my all-time favorite."
5,I have very bad posture,"This is the Quintessential cd for ALL Nirvana fans. Kurt proves his musical powerss on the amazing cd. Every song showcase his amazing musical and vocal abilty. Not many artist can pull off ""Live"" the way Kurt does. You never felt cheated because you feel the emotions behind the words. In a way it's haunting it's like Kurt is real in the room with you. Makes you long for the days when Kurt was still alive. Who knows were Nirvana could have gone? The man who sold the world may be one of the best songs I've heard performed live. Pennyroyal is awesome. Only Kurt could do in a diffrent key and by himself and make even cooler than it was."
5,acoustic Nirvana,"I love tracks #3, #4, and #11. It's an amazing contrast to hear Nirvana do the unplugged thing, after one is so used to the grunge thing. Both are great. It really sucks that this band was so short-lived. Yet what's cool is that they put out so much material in such a camparatively short span of years. After Cobain blew a hole through his head and was discovered by a local electrician who mistook his body for a dummy, the media suddenly catapulted him into the post of ""spokeman for his generation""--a strange honor to give a dead man who wrote lyrics that don't make sense and never gave a speech in his life. But who gives a f--- about that, its the music that matters, its the music that lives on and on, for future genertaions.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
5,WOW!,"This is probaly the best CD ever made.built mainly of covers,cobain walks away with the crown of punk on his head!"
5,If you don't have this cd there is something wrong.,"To me, if you don't own this cd it's like saying you don't own a Beatles cd. Every track off this cd is breath taking. To know NOTHING was edited and they filmed the show continously with mistakes and all makes it all the better and real. To me, this was one of the band's most personal performances. Amazing lyrics, amazing sound, and heart. If you don't own this, you should no matter what you listen to."
5,Incredible..,"I guess this is the closest I'll ever get to seeing Nirvana live, and judging from this CD it would've been an amazing experience. Kurt's vocals ranged from raw and angry, hoarse, and some songs soft and gentle. There are lots of different types on songs on here, and in my opinion, they're all great. Chris and Dave were also talented musicians. All the music is emotional and personal and they play with all they're got. Come As You Are, Plateau, and a lot of the other songs are haunting and you can feel Kurt's pain in the way he attacks some songs like Where Did You Sleep Last Night and Lake of Fire, which are both Meat Puppets covers. Songs like Jesus Don't Want Me For a Sunbeam show their softer side. Kurt's death was really a tragedy in the music world in which he never felt like he belonged, but Nirvana's songs, which revolutionized music of the time, left a lasting impression that won't be forgotten."
5,Cobain's Brilliant Last Stand,"This is a towering, trandescent live acoustic performance that Kurt Cobain & the gang recorded for MTV in November 1993, just five months prior to Cobain's untimely demise. The band perform eight originals including ""Come As You Are"" and ""All Apologies,"" as well as six cover songs, including David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold The World"" & three songs by the Meat Puppets (who guest perform on the songs). Anyone who never heard the talent in Cobain's singing, songwriting, and guitar-playing on Nirvana's full-throttle studio records before, OR the talent of Cobain's bandmates Krist Novelselic & Dave Grohl, absolutely MUST give ""MTV Unplugged In New York"" a listen. The band's stripped-down approach to the material brings out the beauty in the songs for ALL to hear. Heck, you can even play this Nirvana album for your grandmother, and chances are she'll love it. It's a gorgeous live performance, and a powerful final testament to the talent & genius of Kurt Cobain & his band."
5,My Favorite CD,"This album is so awesome...everything in here is so killer...all the songs on here are either as good or better than the originals..Kurt's shrieking in ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?"" and the guitar solo in ""Come As You Are"" are two of the creepiest pieces of music I've ever heard.Nirvana wasn't just one the best of the ninties,but one of the best bands ever...""About A Girl"",""Oh,Me"",""Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbbeam"",""PennyRoyal Tea"",""All Apologies""...this cd is incredible...just listen to it and it will be one of the greatest experiences of your life.""I'm Thing One,that's Thing Two""PS:Courtney did NOT kill Kurt,alright?"
5,This is a great CD I recomend it to all music fans,"Unplugged is a very good example of how great Nirvana really is. This band has never put out a bad album. It's pretty funny too, you get to know how the band members are really like in between songs. there are some of the best songs I have heard on this album including A Solo ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""Where did you sleep last night?"" written by Huddie Ledbetter (Leadbelly). I got this CD in 96' as a birthday present. It does make a good gift, you won't be sorry you got this"
5,Nirvana's Testamente,"This concert, took place november 1993. It took a year before it were released on CD. Kurt Cobain commited suicide april 1994. He had few concerts after MTV Unplugged In New York. To me this got to be Kurt Cobain and his band Nirvana's testamente. With sunrising, clear and focused voice of guitarplayer and singer Kurt Cobain. With help on backup songs, Dave Grohl and their mates from Meat Puppets help them passing trough 14 songs.My favourite top 4 got to be:1. All Apologies2. The Man Who Sold The World3. Where Did You Sleep Last Night4. Something In The WayBut how can I even choose, you know."
4,Kurt's primal scream,"This album is memorable and meaningful as well as very soft! You don't have to be fans of alternative rock to be able to appreciate this album's content. In the song ""Where did you sleep last night?"" Kurt unleashed the full power of his amazing voice in one scream! Be sure not to miss out on this great album by Nirvana."
5,Nirvana's Best,"In my opinion this is Nirvana's best cd. Yes better than Nevermind. While Nevermind is great and genre defining Unplugged shows exactly how versatile Nirvana was and gives you an idea of what direction they may have taken had Cobain not (allegedly) committed suicide. The slower songs on here are both beautiful and haunting. Jesus Don't Want Me for a Sunbeam, Pennyroyal Tea, Lake of Fire, About a Girl are amazing. But Where Did You Sleep Last Night is the BEST!!! This song is even more haunting than the original by the great bluesman Leadbelly. It still gives me chills everytime I hear it. They did this song tremendous justice. And I think Leadbelly would approve of it himself. If you own only one Nirvana CD this should be it."
5,A Baby Boomer rates Nirvana,"I never really liked Nirvana until I happened to see part of Nirvana's ""Unplugged"" on TV one day when I was flipping channels. I am a ""Baby Boomer"" who grew up listening to Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, etc. When I first heard ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" on the radio I didn't really like it. About the only so-called ""Grunge Rock"" that I liked was Neil Young's ""Mirror Ball"" and some of his other work with ""Crazy Horse."" (Of course anything by Neil Young is great). And Nirvana Unplugged is great. I bought both the DVD and CD; they are both 5 star recordings. If you are a ""Classic Rocker"" like myself and think you don't like Nirvana, give this one a listen. You will love it."
5,An essential,"This is one of my very favorite CDs. I'm sure I can't say more than has already been said in the other reviews. I have always been a Nirvana fan, but not a fanatic. Regardless of your feelings for Nirvana, this CD is so clear and crisp on your stereo you will play it just for the amazing sound."
5,Very Good,"This album is very good. Come as you are sounds really good, and i like both versions of it."
3,Fair,"Kurt's voice sounded a little better on this then on other live performances, but the song selection was not great. Much better then the other live CD(""From the muddy banks of the Wishkah""). Nirvana was not the best Seattle band but they were pretty good at what they did. It is worth having it."
2,Nirvana,"Alright children Nirvana is good, but to say they are immortalized, come on. Now yes the acoustic setting helps aid the nirvana songs ease of listening and yeah dave grohl is very talented but to go as far to talk kurt cobain up like some kind of figure, come on now. The album is good if you like nirvana if not just download the select songs because for a whole album purchase id say it doesnt rank among alot of albums out there..."
5,Simply Sweet,"Putting on this performance is probably the best thing MTV has ever done. If you know nothing about Nirvana all you need to know is in this album. It sums up the bands emotional power and its musical genious. Listining to this album you can almost feel the atmosphere that was in the building when they played. The great thing about the album is that the cover songs, from Man Who Sold the World to Where Did You sleep Last night,are just amazing. The collaboration with the Meatpuppets created some great songs also like Lake of Fire and plateu. The interaction between the band and the audience can also give you a laugh here or there which is nice. Finally I dont think that they could have ended any better by playing Where Did You Sleep Last Night, it closes out the show perfectly and is a powerful enough song to move you to tears."
5,in full beauty,"This is one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard in my life, the passion and emotion in kurt's voice was just surreal...espically the last song..even if you are not a nirvana fan you must try out this cd! Jessica Svensson"
4,Oops import!,"I didn't mean to order the import of this. I guess I spaced when choosing it. I think the only thing that is differnt about the import is an additional insert. With that said, this recording is, in my mind, one of the most imporant recordings in Rock history. Besides the import thing, this is 5 stars all the way."
5,Timeless,"I couldn't honestly say I am a fan of Nirvana, for I do not own a single CD nor have I listened to many of their songs. In fact, despite the constant talk about them, I barely even knew who they were when my freind lent me this CD. You can assume then, that this review is not at all baised. Kurt is a great songwriter (albeit overrated), and his vocal abilities soar in this live preformance, and he puts real emotion into what he does. Being a fan of David Bowie, i find his cover of 'The Man who sold the World' to be breathtaking and well-done. Another favorite track on this cd would be 'Plataeu.' I was surprised at how much i liked this CD even though i dont like this kind of music."
2,Okay,"I bought this as a gift for my husband 2 years ago & was recently informed that the album was a little warped when he received it. We just finally bought a record player so we haven't played it yet to see if it affects playing it yet. He does love the album though, hopefully it plays properly."
5,nirvana unplugged,i love it it has really good quality its a really good gift for someone that loves music as much as i do no a days people use ipods and staff but i use a record player is much better
4,better accoustic to my ears,"never was much for grunge except Nirvana and Hole. But there are a couple of really brilliant covers here: ""Man who sold the world"" and ""Jesus Don't want me for a Sunbeam"". Also very nice that I could replace my vinyl version so cheaply (Luddism does have its payoffs). Also, this seller is one of my favorites- fast, cheap and good selection"
5,unforgettable,"Thank goodness this perfomance is available for everyone to buy. Kurt pays homage to some of his musical influences to great effect rounding off the performance with a rendition of Leadbelly's 'Where Did You Sleep Last Night' that is so heartfelt and gutsy that he almost sounds possessed by the great Blues songwriter. The rawness of this song befits the tone of all the preceding tracks which are typically moody and dark but also deeply passionate and musical. Even the Meat Puppets quirky tunes are made to sound quite melodic.Their own songs translate beautifully in the unplugged format, the inclusion of a cello and extra guitarist Pat Smear adds to the dynamic of classics like Polly and About A Girl, while the softer songs from In Utero - Dumb and All Apologies - actually end up sounding better unplugged than the studio versions (if that were possible)."
5,not really a review looking,I was wondering if anyone out there knew how i could obtain a copy of noose bootleg version of unplugged any info greatly appreciated thanks china cat email poofdakat@aol.com
5,this is probably the best nirvana cd!,"i loved this cd.nirvanas unplugged performance should be charished for all eternity. anyone who likes nirvana, punk,alternative, rock all together should by this album. even if u hated nirvana please buy this albume itll change ur opinion."
3,So-so,"Even though I have a hatred toward Nirvana that exceeds pure hatred, I must say I am impressed with this album. My friend had this playing and I was like, whoa, is this Nirvana! This is good stuff! Impressive! Buy this album! It's good. Paranoia, you got good musical taste, but clean up the excessive bad words, okay dude?"
5,No one's better,"Nirvana rules. Kirt Cobain would have been a zillionaire if he wasn't so stupid and killing himself. This guy has a heavenly voice, His music is the best, the songs are just so cool. This cd is the best one he has though, the others are good, but this one rocks"
4,arguably the best Nirvana album,"Nirvana is NOT a band that's about being pre-packaged or polished, so it's in an acoustic setting that their talent really shows. Kurt's characteristic grumble is accentuated throughout the album giving the whole thing a more personal feel to it. There are many good tracks from previous cds, but my personal favorites are the way Nirvana covers Jesus Doesn't Want Me For A Sunbeam by the Vasolines and my personal favorites The Man Who Sold the World by David Bowie and Where Did You Sleep Last Night by legendary bluesman, Leadbelly. The best tracks from Nirvana's stuff are Come As You Are, Polly, Dumb, and the lamenting Something in the Way. This album is beautifully constructed and the performances well-executed, the only low part in my opinion, is Plateau, which features Kurt screeching ""Sitting on the top with a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds"". But I highly recomend the cd otherwise."
1,THIS IS NOT A DVD !!!,"i think it's sad that amazon puts this into DVD section and give DVD specs, when it's an audio CD. Even worse, i ordered this thinkin it was a DVD and all i got was a transcript book of unplugged in New York !!!Always been happy from my orders at amazon, but this is unacceptable for such a big online store like amazonan angry customer"
1,One star but dont get me wrong,"I appreciate Nirvana as the greatest band in 90's and I will give 5 stars to all of their studio albums except Nevermind(4.5). But for rock's sake I cannot forgive this unplugged one. Reason:1. It's a MTV show so it cannot help being contrived.2. Unplugged Nirvana sounds weird. I doubt anyone who favors their music will endure such a pretentious form of rock music.There are terrific acoustic/folk musicians but Nirvana is out of this league.3.This show is fake emotional and misleading. That's why we got a lot of self-destructive whiners aka Post-grunge to ruin music. I guarantee all of them are inspired by this show. It is even worse than American Idol.One star for Krist's accordion and introduction of Meat Puppets.If you want to know a real Nirvana, get Muddy Banks. 10/100."
1,"Sorry, I don't get it","I listened to this several times trying to see what the attraction was to this joker and backing band. Seems to me that its accoustic, flat, no talent stuff that wouldn't get recorded if he was a no name. Try Jackson Browne, if you want some emotion and even melody. Like most critics though, I can barely play a chord - so he was great measured against someone who is not a songwriter, singer and musician."
1,pure trash,"What a poor excuse for music. Cant sing, cant play, this is whats called music? Poor excuse for entertainment. Must be awful if you can pick it up for less than $3.00 on line"
1,IM GIVING IT 1 STAR CUS IVE ONLY HEARD 1 SONG OFF THE ALBUM,"I only heard 1 song off the album, the song where Curt keeps screaming, ""LOGGER TRUCK!!! LOGGER TRUCK!!"" over & over, i dont get the lyricsBut what i do get is how in retrospect the isolation caused the mass evolution of intersection change in vertibre""LOGGER TRUCK!! LOGGER TRUCK!!!""get some better lyrics Cabin, someone needs to tell this Cabin fellow to get his head together"
5,Great,I was not a big fan of Nirvana. Only six when Nevermind came out and When I bought it I didn't like it that much and it was a bit overrated etch. (see my Nevermind review). When I bought this album for my sister's fifteenth birhtday (i was ten). I started listen to it in her beedroom. It was great. It was really good. upplugeed nothing heavy peformance. I think that Kurt felt really good when he did uplugged because it wasn't the whole smells like teen spirit thing which he was trying to escape. this LP has wonderful good music on it and includes some great arrangements on it as well. So if you wan't to buy something with Nirvana. Buy this one you won't regret it. Everybody I know likes it and it recieved full house so there's nothing that says you shouldn't
5,Heartwrenching stuff,"Kurt Cobain proves on this recording that punk or any kind of rock for that matter has nothing to do with amps. It comes out in the voice and in the ache of a bent guitar string. Cobain disregards musical genres here to show that they don't matter. Whether he's singing an old blues song, a glam-rock classic or a trail-blazing original number, Cobain rips the same heart out every time. And the support he gets from his band-mates is nothing less than extraordinary. Novoselic's accordion on ""Jesus Don't Want Me for a Sunbeam"" deserves an award by itself. Essential listening for anyone who cares about genuine soul in rock music."
3,Though I'm an avid fan of Nirvana...,"... this isn't their best live CD. There's only two good points about this CD--the raw emotion of Kurt's live performances and the last track, ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night"". But if you're looking for a GREAT live Nirvana album, go find ""From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah"" at a used CD store in your area--it's AWESOME!! - My $0.02"
5,A Sweet Goodbye,"This is a great album, by a great band. But why did I say ""A Sweet Goodbye""? not because of Kurt Cobain's unfortunate suicide but, because this was likely to be Nirvana's last album anyway, and boy did they make it count. This is a mellowed out version of some of their greatest hits (including a bone chilling, and sa All apologies) but ohter less payed attention to songs are featured here, which is good considering this is an album just long enough to keep one listening to the the entire thing, and not too short like Nirvana's other albums. All in all, Nirvana's best album.1. *About a girl 5/52. *Come as you are 5/53. *Jesus doesn't want me as a sunbeam 5/54. The man who sold the world 5/55. Pennyroyal tea 5/56. Dumb 5/57. Polly 5/58. On a plain 5/59. *Something in the way 5/510. *Plateau 5/511. Oh, me 5/512. *Lake of fire 5/513. *All apologies 5/514. Where did you sleep last night 5/5*= reccomended track1= aweful 2= poor 3= decent 4= good 5= great"
5,A Believer...,"No long winded review, here. Just wanted to say that, as only a casual Nirvana listener, this Unplugged album is not only the absolute best live album I've ever listened to but it's among the best recorded musical works I've ever heard in my life. This album proves that Nirvana is much more than a label - ""Grunge"" and much more than a mediocre post-punk song - ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"".Buy this CD. Givie it a spin and be transported to a musical Nirvava...Take Care, Dave~"
4,Good choice,"I purchased this switch to run the dust collector in my home workshop. It works from every location in my shop, even through partitions."
5,What a time saver,I love this dust collector switch. I use it with my Harbor Fright 2 HP dust collector and have had absolutely no problems with it carrying such a load. I do not have the DC running constantly. I turn it on and off with the machinery. It has never felt warm and the power cord is also cool to the touch. What a handy switch. I would recommend it to anyone in the same situation.
5,Great addition to your shop,Don't know why I waited so long to get this for my shop. This remote has been a step saver and an energy saver. No more leaving the dust collector run longer than needed. The remote has very good range from anyplace in my shop. This unit easily handles my Delta 1.5 hp dust collector.
1,Failed after 65 days,The Long Ranger 3 worked adequately for 65 days. I could not stand between the transmitter and receiver or it did not function. That was acceptable until it stopped working completely. You can't get much worse than working just long enough that Amazon will not accept a return.
4,great step saver,Although the remote is a little long this may help me remember where it is. This product is working just fine with my 1 1/2 horsepower dust collecter and saving me steps and time. It also encoureges me to use the collector for that single cut that I sometimes made without rather than walking over to turn the collector on.
5,great product,"Saves me from running to the switch all the time. Have it right at my saw, push the button and the dust collector goes on. How easy can it get.Great product."
4,does what it is supposed to,"Really don't have any complaints, it does do what it is made for. I gave it four stars just because the remote is pretty big and really ugly. Suppose it is easier to find that way."
1,very disappointing,"The unit that I received in the mail was faulty when I received it. To Amazons' credit, returning the faulty product could not have been easier."
4,Long Ranger 110 volts,It's very funny to work with this product .I controle a 1 1/2 Hp Dust collector with the long ranger and it's very cool .
4,Works like a charm!,This is my second Long Ranger! The first has been in use for about 15 years and finally gave out. The remote runs forever on the batteries and the only time the unite did not function is when it died!Great unit!
5,great addition to any dust collection system,"I bought this product for use with my Delta 1 1/2 HP dust collector, and I can't recommend it highly enough. Installation is simple (just plug the receiver into the wall, then plug the dust collector into the outlet on the receiver), and a wall mounting bracket is provided. The Long Ranger is rated at 20 amps, but my dust collector draws somewhat more than that in starting up (I had an electrician check it when he installed a new circuit in my shop for it), and the Long Ranger has never complained.Though the instructions warn that certain types of motors (Shop Vacs were mentioned specifically) might cause interference, I've had no trouble -- the switch performs perfectly from anywhere in my shop, and it's a lot more convenient than running over to the dust collector every time I start up a power tool!"
5,Terrific Remote Activator,"I purchased the 110 V version of the Long Ranger to run a Delta 1-1/2 HP dust collector in my new shop. It works wonderfully. I've used remote devices before in other shops and this one has superior range and it works absolutely every time - through walls, doors, and at distances of over 50'! I'm very satisfied and would highly recommend it for any shop.Jeff"
5,Dust Collection Made Easy,"Couldn't be happier with this product. Use it a small shop using A HF dust collector. When ready to to use just hit the remote ""on"" button from anywhere in the room. When done push the ""off"" button."
3,"Pretty decent book, with a little bias.","I am enjoying this book so far, but find the author to be a bit biased against some businesses."
4,good service,"good service, quick response to emails, arrived exact when it should, in time for my class."
2,"Performance good, but screen display will fail","I bought this phone back in June 2006 to expand my Motorola SD4500 base unit. The phone has always performed well, but now (June 2008), the display on both of the cordless handsets is failing. You'll first notice a whole line of broken characters in the display, then, eventually, another line. I'm guessing it'll soon get to the point when the display will become unreadable. Too bad - I like the phones but can't recommend them because of the crummy display."
5,wonderful,Son brought the main phone as a gift for me this was as additional add on for that phone wonderful.
3,Good sheets,"I was skeptical about buying these sheets because of some of the negative comments I read here. I found these sheets to be soft and comfortable. They are 50/50 cotton and polyester blend. Naturally, these sheets are not as silky smooth as 100% cotton 300 thread count sheets. But, for the price, I was very happy with this purchase."
1,D'Incandescent INFRED Lamp,"The product was described as INFRARED Lamp but there is no infrared description from the manufacturer's brochure enclosed. I am just glad to read the description as INCANDSCENT now,corrected from the previous description."
4,Not a universal mount,"Length:: 0:20 MinsIt is difficult to see if parts match without actually picking them up and putting them together. The ""Scotty"" mounting plate for the fish finder did not fit the Lowrance fish finder I bought. I cut a piece of hardwood to fit the fish finder and attached it to the ""Scotty"" mounting post. It will work great."
5,"Quality, works good","Heavy duty, works good. No problems, a little bulky, but its good quality. No problems. .. ... .... ..... ...... ........"
5,Backyard Basketball is so cool!!!,"I like Backyard Basketball. Forst, there are different courts. Second, there are great players like Yao Ming and Shaquille O'Neil. Mostly, I like playing because I win a lot and it is a lot of fun. I recommend this game."
2,"Lame, Lame, LAME","To offset the horrible ""improvements"" of 2005, composure, etc. we get the positively awful Impact Player. Since when is a lower-tier D1-A RB breaking five tackles per play realistic? And the composure aspect is exaggerated. So in preparation for a loud stadium, the team has NO hand signals, silent counts, etc to help freshman execute? Terrible. Long Bombs are incredibly easy to complete on both sides, which makes for high scores and - SURPRISE EA SPORTS!- boring games.The title has gone downhill dramatically since 2004. To not even tweak the create-a-school option is just plain lazy. Makes you think about the amount of time they put into the game and where it is focused. My friends and I used to play 250+ games a year on this game, and now we are selling it back after two weeks. You should be ashamed EA. Ill give this game one more year."
1,"Same features as before, plus some major flaws","This game has the same features as before,so in theory, if you a true fan of the series you would be happy, right? Wrong, same features don't cut it, add to that some major flaws in online and solo play, and you would be wasting your money, like I did, if you buy this piece of crap.The most frustrating flaw that's made me sell my copy or just give it away, is that the game slows down so much during key plays, that you just don't get a chance to execute of control the action, and the computer more than often will come up with a BS play to beat you, when otherwise, if the play didn't slow down you would prevail. The crazy thing is that the same happens online, which makes it the worst playing experience I've had with an EA Sports product. I was a big fan of this series, but now I am seriously disappointed.I reccommend playing the NFLA 2k and the ESPN branded games...a lot cheaper, simpler and flawless during play. My 2 cents."
5,Best NCAA game yet,"This is the best NCAA game yet. Last year there were little improvements. This year, EA gave us loads of improvements. The most important is the impact player. This is your go to player who can make huge plays while ""in the zone."" Another big addition is Race for the Heisman. It is a nice feature, although it needs more improvements.Pros:New scrambling mode is betterFun online playRFTHImpact PlayersCons:Deep ball works WAY to wellNo roster namesA fast QB is hard to stopOverall: Great game 4 1/2 out of 5"
2,Okay this is the deal.,The graphics are good the game looks good. Got some cool features so it must be a good game right? ehh wrong.The problem with this game is that it has a certain program that when ever you start winning it comes back and beats you. It has happened to me and my friends several times. I once had a RB break 7 tackles for a TD and I lost the game because of that. Another thing is it's main focus is on scoring. Your DB can't play Defense worth crap. They will always get burn no matter what. Its total crap. I prefer 2005 over '06. 2005 is more Defense and you have to acctually work for a TD or a point instead of throwing up a ball and having your reciever come down with it every time.Save your money and buy another game.
1,not for gamecube?,"I was really looking foward to getting Ncaa and Madden 06 this year. All I have is a Gamecube, and Ncaa isn't for Gamecube! What's this all about?"
5,THE BEST COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is so cool! The race for the hiesman mode is amazing. Plus the Washington Huskies suck which is even better!Go Cougs!
3,^-^**xXBest College Footall Title Out ThereXx**^-^,its graet heres a cheet oxifynse for always break takles for tuchdouns it is fun i love it more than u thats ao lot alot as in many loveings but this game is my wife
5,The best effort yet in the NCAA series.,"I've had every version of EA's NCAA series since its inception in 1998 and I have to say...this is the best ever. The graphics have gotten better every year but it's not all about that. It's the gameplay. Wow. The movement is true to life and the schemes on both sies of the ball are realistic. Run plays have holes opening like they really do on the gridiron and passing for 600 yards a game isn't much of a possibility anymore. The Mascot Game is still useless though. Bring back College Classics from 2000 and 2001!Some of the controls have changed and new features, like the juke stick and impact players, have been added, making this the best video game football simulation to ever hit the PS2 or any other platform.Let's GOOOO MOUNTAINEERS!"
3,Good game,"The game is almost the same as last year. The only reason i bought the game was because i wanted to imort my player into Madden but its a waste of time. You will be drafted in the 2-3 round even if you win 4 heismans. the rest of the game is the same as last years, ok graphics o.k. game play too. it is still a good game but dont bother getting madden if you want to get this NCAA game instead.GO BC Eagles and NE Partiots"
2,dissapointment,"I'm really dissapointed in NCAA 2006. I think that race for the hiesman was a great idea, but that EA didn't follow through as well as they should of. It is still a fun, but there are alot of flaws that make it boring. For one thing, theres just not enough to do. You just play the game, and if you are good and pick a posistion that gets touches the ball alot (ex. QB) Than you can win the heisman in your first year (as I did) and the game is pretty much beaten. Because EA spent so much time developing ""race for the heisman,"" they didn't really spend enough time on the dynasty mode which is still pretty much the same as last year. The only difference is the in-season recruiting which is fun, but at the same time overrated and frustrating. If you own NCAA 2005, or even 2004, I dont recomend you get this game. I would wait untill Madden 2006 came out to get a fun football game."
4,It is a really good party game,The only reason i ever even played this game was because a friend of mine had a ncaa party. Being a huge madden fan i figured id have some skill so i went and it was awesome. My brother and i played the greatest game of all time as proccessed by the game. That was one of the things that impressed me. it has a ranking of the greatest games you play and you can see the best games in college football history and how yours rank.
4,Seiko Watch....a great buy,Bought this watch for my Son who is hard on watches. This watch does not have a lot of bells and whistles but looks great. My Son took it to a kiosk at a mall and had the extra links removed at a cost of $8.00. The watch was a great buy with no problems.
4,Seiko watch,"Very nice watch but disappointed with the visibility of the hands and hour markers. The luminescent markers on the hands and hours is barely visible during the day against the black background, and pretty much useless at night. The second hand is so thin it's almost invisible.Missing from the package was any indication of how to adjust the watch band. Had to go to the internet and fortunately ran across some advice as to how to adjust the band. Can't figure why Seiko keeps it a secret.Keeps good time...checked against my atomic clocks, it seems to be running about 10 seconds a month slow."
2,Not Recommended,"We bought this faucet in 2007, had it installed by a plumber along with a new sink.Initially worked fine but gradually became difficult to swivel from side to side .Also noted (too late unfortunately) was a small leak from the spray head attachment traveling down the flexible hose.The plumber who replaced it (we got a Moen instead) told us he has replaced other Rohl faucets with similar problems."
4,BEST TOY EVER,this toy is great. Ilove boats and this is my favorite so far. it is not the fastest one though. the control is great but when the batterie gets low the boat will barely turn so it is hard to get back but overall itis a good toy
4,Poirot Does it Again!,"How Does Your Garden Grow? - Good mystery, not too much depth, but at least Miss Lemon gets to leave the office! And it's always fun when Agatha Christe uses nursurey rhymes as plot devices. It creates sort of a surreal atmosphere. - 4 starsThe Adventure of the Western Star - More typical Poirot. It's easy to get used to how wonderful these are and start treating their greatness casually! My favorite part of this one is Hastings and his China-man! - 4 starsThe Kidnapped Prime Minister - Ireland gets some of the lime-light in this one as Russia did in the first. My favorite part of this one is when Miss Lemon is trying to remember the name of the castle! - 4 starsBox Set Overall score (Not an Average) - 4 stars"
2,Typical distorted-guitar rock. Nothing special.,"I got this Remy Zero album along with Fun Lovin' Criminals' ""Come Find Yourself"" (both brand new) for fifty cents each at my local music store last month. To be honest, I only wanted the Criminals' cassette, but I needed to buy two cassetes to get both for just a buck, so I chose Remy Zero because of the cover. But for what the music is, it's fine. It's typical ""alternative"" rock with distorted guitars (and on Geffen! What a surprise!), so if that ain't your thing, don't get it, but since Alt. Rock is atill really popular, I think most people will like it. It's nothing amazing, but I can't find much fault with it other than the fact it's quite dull. I've only listened to most of it once, but no songs stick out in my mind, which isn't a great sign.2.5 stars out of 5."
3,Remy Zero,"Was a little surprised that I actually didnt like this CD that much, because I LOVED Villa Elaine. ITs not terrible, its just not that great either.."
2,Not what it I thought it would be,It seems that not much research went into this so call Metaphysical Bible Dictionary. It fails at having just about every word I try to look up.
2,Ehh...You have to be kidding,This is anything but anime...and definitely anything but a worthy representation of the Darkstalkers series.
1,Snitch Work,"Moralistic U.S. government/department of education propaganda slickly marketed to the teenage market as an oh so hip ""indie"" feature. Probably ghost written by Orin Hatch."
3,Jerks,"It was a chore to watch the first thirty minutes of this movie. Then I sat through quite a few scenes where the characters are the kind of jerks that I wanted to get out of my chair and hit them and the writer. It's sort of like Billy Jack for the new millenium but without the martial arts and without Billy Jack who was a big douche bag but could occasionally be riveting!If you like movies about the most pretentious jerks in high school making the dumbest, most serious mistakes possible, then this is the movie for you. It is full of roaring, flaming jerks and a boring feret who looks very uncomfortable being around such tools."
4,An excellent movie,"Not only is this a great movie, but on this forthcoming dvd, you also have the chance to see Vincent pereira's directors cut, along with intro's by Kevin Smith. The movie itself is fantastic - it follows the unfortunate Barrett Michaelson, who is having a bad first day at his new high school - he is badgered, ridiculed, and nearly beaten up. He finds an unlikely ally in local loner, Ryan Walker, an intelligent but misanthropic youth with a dark family past. A friendship quickly develops, but Barrett begins to worry as Ryan's philosophical ranting turns increasingly violent. When Barrett does the unthinkable and makes peace with the local teenagers Ryan so despises, Ryan loses all control and attempts to drag Barrett down into his world of hatred and destruction - and Barrett must find a way to escape. I highly recommend this film."
4,Scarlett Moon...Little Red Ridding Hood Revised,"This book is another entry to the series, Once Upon a Time. In this book, I think the emphasis change from the original Red Ridding Hood is that the Wolf is not evil. Instead the wolf was Ruth, the Character,'s lover. This book is very good, but not the best I've ever read. It has very good Diaglogs that is almost but not quite as good as Shakespere's."
1,Thouroughly dissapointed!!!,"I was extremely dissapointed with this books. I've read better fanfiction about Little Red Riding Hood. I was expected too much from an author like Debbie Viguie. Her writing style is lacking something, and her characters are too flat and have no personality. The concept was charming, but the story itself was too rushed and had no substance. Even the setting and relationships were terribly thought out. I didn't like Midnights Pearl at all, but this book was so much more worse."
3,I'm Sorry...,"I honestly say that I wish that I had loved this book, but I can't. The author had a huge mistake- the theme was hollow. All that the author describes is lust. That was not love.Not to say that the book was all bad. The plot was really, really interesting, The story of Little Red Riding Hood retold very well. The story grabs you and keeps you until the telling is done. I'm impressed with how well planned and thought out it was.An interesting read, but it could have been so much better. And I'm sorry that it wasn't."
3,"An ok read , buy used.","Normally I review most books fairly high and I've loved all the books in the Once Upon a Time series that I've read so far, but this one only rates a mediocre.I didn't have any problems finishing it, so I can't say it was horrible (I usually stop if gets to that) It was worth spending the time on. I just found the story too unbelievable. I don't want to put in any spoilers so I will simply say that even though I can see where the author was trying to go with this, no human person on earth would ever react the way that the main female lead did. It makes some of the fan-fiction I've read seem plausible."
4,a pleasant way to spend an afternoon,"This is basically a retelling of the classic fairytale ""Little Red Riding Hood"", one of my favorites as a child. I thought the words flowed and the overall plot was engaging. I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending was a little abrupt. The last chapter summed up things a bit too neatly and it seemd as if the author got tired of writing the book. But I still liked it and would recommend it as a pleasant way to spend an afternoon."
4,Good book,"It was a good book, however a fast read. It had good character development as well as storyline, kept reader engaged."
5,An Important Book,"This is an important book which addresses one of the greatest threats to religious liberty in the world today.Peele et al. have done an excellent job, leaving but one stone unturned in their research. Don't forget our women and men in uniform.Forced AA in the US Military is Unconstitutional(...)"
1,"""Rarely have we seen a person fail""","""Rarely have we seen a person fail, who has thoroughly followed our path."" These words are from the Big Book of AA, THE 12 step program. It works. The book shown here is a joke. Follow this book and you're likely to keep getting the lesson because I don't believe you'll learn anything here. If you have a desire to stop drinking, this book could cost you more than you're willing to pay; namely, your life. If you're willing to fight a 12 step program, you probably aren't ready to get sober."
5,"Good Legal Sense, Good Management Sense","The relationship between employee and employer has never been smooth. Even back in Dickens ""A Christman Carol"" the relationship was strained. Then around the turn of the last century we had all the efforts with the unions being developed. Now unions are declining and the lawyers have taken over.I've had my share of working for bad managers. In fact there've only been a couple that I would have rated as good. Those managers followed the rules that Mr. Janove has written down. This is good legal advice, but it is just plain good management advice as well. This is the way you would want to be treated by a manager, and it is clearly the way you should treat your employees.The eight deadly sins he defines are not coached in legal terms, they are just good common sense that we should all follow."
2,It's ok,"I like that the cover is washable...but because the cover is so thick, it doesn't provide the heat that one with a thinner cover provides."
4,"Nice and soothing, but not for too long.",I like the heating pad and use it regularly. It doesn't retain heat as well as the cherry stone version I had previously. But it does a good job for about 45 minutes and I do like the aroma.
2,"Smells nice, doesn't get very warm","Smells nice, really soft, but doesn't get that warm. i might as well just put my pillow in the microwave."
3,"good for it's time, but that's it.","unless if you appreciate the classics, you will hate this game. if you're used to playing games like Halo or Counter Strike, you'll hate this game.compared to other titles of it's time, it's good, but not the best. i like to think of this as a dumbed-down version of Final Fantasy VII. that's probably one reason why i like playing this game. i'm no god of RPGs (even though i love playing them) so it's easier for me to complete a less complicated game like this as compared to FFVII and other such titles."
5,It is a cool game,This game extra long so you can play alot more than some games. This game has the best boss music.It's the best rpg i ever played.
2,This game is all eye-candy and not much else.,"While the graphics (especially the FMVs) are breathtaking to behold, that's where the good stuff ends. Gameplay is a drag, and I found the game very tedious and generally a bore to play. While previously rumored to be the Final Fantasy killer, this game doesn't even reach 20% of the FF series' fun factor."
4,loads of fun,"The game as played by my son has an entire story line to it with many characters and places, lots of imagination. He talks about it often, and put aside other games just to play this one, so it must be good. Received product quickly and in good condition."
5,really fun long rpg,While the dialouge is somewhat cheesy the plot has good twists and it has a failry unique turn based attack system making it more than simply picking an actino and watching things play out. One of my all time favorites. I have played it three times and it never gets old. Great game!
5,A Sweet RPG,"One of the best RPGs I have ever played(right behind the Final Fantisies.)It has everything you need in a game,a great storyline,fast paced action,and great characters. The best part is the storyline it can get a little confusing but it all comes together at the end.In the End this is how it stacks up against bigger RPGs.1.Final Fantasy 72.Legend of Dragoon3.Final Fantasy 10(PS2)4.Chrono Trigger5.Chrono Cross6.Final Fantay 97.Final Fantasy 88.Final Fantasy 10-2So in my opinion one of the best RPGs ever."
2,fair,"Is one of my favorite games. When I first started playing it, it was doing good. Then it kept freezing and I had to return it."
5,Very nice RPG,"I rember playing a demo of this game a long time ago and I loved it so I just had to buy it and I have owned this game for years now and I have beat it 3 times sence then and it can be compared to the Final Fantasy games. This has been my favorite game up untill Final Fantasy 9 came along. The price is worth it,the story is long (just the way I like them) and the game has ""some"" voice acting in it, I love the battles you can Transform into dragoon warriors (Think sailor moon but with out the nudity)And this is kinda what made me watch sailor moon in the 1st place now I own all the dvds.There are alot of nice CG'S in this game to help the story. and you get alot of main charaters to place in a battle formation anyway you like.Over all if you like Rpgs/final fantasys/pretty soldier sailor moon you will enjoy this game. Buy it!"
3,Timing the falling square...UGH!,"I loved everything about this game EXCEPT the battle system; having to match that falling square at EXACTLY the right time gets annoying!At first it was pretty easy and I thought it was cool,but the fact that later on you have to do it four to eight times without missing??? FORGET ABOUT IT!!"
3,meh,"I thought the graphics were great and the story was interesting, but it is very boring after not very long. The combat is like a barebones final fantasy system, only attacks can be extended to create combos by pushing a button at the right time. It takes a ridiculus amount of time to level up and you have to level up because it is a hard game. I would have finished it if leveling up wasn't so slow, but I had to quit in the second disk because I spent most of the game leveling up. If it wasn't for that problem I would have liked the game."
3,Great Game Bad Glitch,"I absolutely love this game. It is by far the best one for PS1 however for some reason my copy has a bad glitch after a boss fight on disc 2. Fight works great but when you try to continue you get a beutiful black screen. Have done all I can. No scratches, new game, bad glitch."
4,Okay,"I had already made a review, and after playing LOD some more decided to change my opinion. First of all, the cinematic scenes are vivid and show plenty, they beat Final Fantasy. LOD is easy to pick up and fun. There is not much of a variety of music. The towns are really cool, each one is different from the other. There are a little too many random encounters. The enemies are fairly easy. Additions, make the game a lot more fun, and it's easier to get into it. I love turning into Dragoons. However, the characters have no depth, each one is together with the others for their own reasons, and pretty much have no point. There are plenty of choices given, but none affect the plot what-so-ever. What I find annoying is that almost everyone that gets the least bit involved in the story ends up dying! So, if you like Pokemon, then chances are you'll like LOD as well."
4,"A fun experience, A great memory.","The legend of dragoon is a great game, it is long and has a story that takes a little to grab hold of but once it does its to the finish you go! overall the gameplay and graphics are good, i didn't like the aditions part, sometimes it seemed a little hard to get used to especialy when under pressure. This game got some bad reviews but i'm gonna put it this way..... If i enjoy a game( Duke Nukem) and they take and ""rip that game off""(Serious Sam) i'm still gonna play the hell out of it. If its Fun, its fun! I hope they make a Nuke Dukem cause i will buy it!"
2,Thumbs down for Legend of Dragoon,"Legend of the Dragoon is an extreamly long and noweher near as interesting as the TV comericials make it seem. There are afew areas where the graphics shine. If your hoping for a role playing game that allows you to effect the story line, this is not it. The nost challanging part of this game is fighting a handfull of monsters (each of these battles takes a minium of 1/2 hour). This game pushes you though a horribly long story line, battel sequences are extrealy repetive, and travel between towns is poorly animated. I found the best part of this game is the attack additions. Spells and time spent as a dragoon is extreamly limited and the endinig is disapponting especially after playing for over 60 hours. My advice is save your money and keep looking, better games are out there."
4,Good,"Great grapics, good story line, but... way to much dialog! I want to play the game not go through hours of flashbacks or useless info from worthless charactors. Also not enough riddles or mysteries to solve."
2,Dragoon Christmas 2007,"We received the game in a timely manner. However, when my son opened it for Christmas, He completed disk 1 and went on to disk 2. He finished the first battle and the game stopped there. We have tried several times, but can get nothing else. I emailed the store on what to do, but have not heard back from them."
4,This game rocks!,"This game has very good graphics. The storyline is also very good. The battle scenes are amazing and the ""additions"" combat system is very neat. The best thing about this game is being able to transform into a Dragoon, the Legendary Dragon warrior and unleash extraordinary powers. This is easily one of Sony's best RPG games. I recomend this game for anybody who likes RPG's"
4,Glomp!,"While the animation is sometimes sub-par, and the translation frankly amusing...Example:""I would LOVE to touch such rare treaures of intelligence!""""all right.... but...Stop looking at me like that!""^_^ But the characters are lovable and well thought, dynamic and oftentimes convulted. The plot..... WHEW. It goes forever, and is so richly detailed. Defineately one of the best for PS1. Here's hoping for a sequel!"
5,BEST GAME!!,"I would have to say that this is the BEST game for playstation ever(excluding FF7, of course). The storyline is fantastic, the characters are cool, and each time you think that you have everything figured out, it does a 180 and goes the other way.if I could, I would give it 7 stars. ;)"
5,frikin awesome,"this is the best game ever. the graphics are awesome and the story is the best ive seen, better than all of the final fantasies! this is not a beginner rpg because the bosses are extremely difficult and the combos sometimes take a long time to learn. this game is perfect for any rpg fan and it comes highly reccmonded from everyone that i know that has it. if you havent already, just buy it!"
5,This game rocks!!!!!!!!!!,"If you love fantasy games, then this is the one for you! This game has great graphics and game play. You learn to like all the characters so it's VERY hard to choose which one is your favorite. I've played this game over and over again, and I still can't get enough of it. I highly recommend for YOU ,yes you, to get this game ASAP! You don't know what your missing out on!!!"
4,One of those games which is little of both,Legend of Dragoon is a well made fast paced game. Fast paced becuase to level up QUICKLY you need to fight the bossess. But thats ok i guess because they have rare bad guys you can kill to boost up your leveling. You have additions rather then just clicking attack. which is pretty cool but sometimes its frustrating trying to get the FASTER ones they move like a rocket sometimes. You don't have to worry about money becuase you hardly have to spend on weapons cuz they hardly give you any new ones to buy but it has MANY relics that kick butt. Like one that makes it so you don't have to click X everytime the spinning box goes into the still box to finish the combo! well anyway the story is good! i suggest you buy the stradegy guide from amazon too.. its good to have.. enjoy
4,Very good game,I would recomend this game to any one who like's adventure games. Very good game I thought.
3,good game... if it were released three years ago,"At first I was looking forward to playing legend of dragoon, but when i finally got it I found it to be sub par. The graphics are similar, but not as good, as Final Fantasy VII, and a game of this day should not look the same as a game of three years ago. Other than the graphics, the gameplay is good, and so is the storyline. but with all the great looking games with story's just as good i'd suggest not wasting your time with this game."
2,Not exactly a Final Fantasy,"Being a fan of great storylines and the classic RPG battle styles, I did not care too much for this game. The story was good up to the end of the second disc, but then I just got bored with it. I didn't like the whole battle system and the fact that the amount of items you could carry was very limited. I will admit, the animation is pretty good, though, for PS one."
3,Who said this was a FF killer?,"This game is ok. This is definetly no Final Fantasy killer, the graphics are no where close to what Square was able to pull off on the old PSX, the sound doesn't have the ambience of that which a FF game would have. The battle system is alright but I'm getting sick and tired of that annoying arcade-style voice saying the name of the combo every time you pull it off. They say it took Sony 3 years to make this game, I would have thought they could have done a better job with this game."
4,Legend of Dragoon: Review,"The Legend of Dragoon is an epic adventure that enfolds as the past is enveloped into the future, and where dragoons once again walk the earth in an attempt to defy fate and fulfill destiny. The battle system in this game is simply amazing, with beautiful graphics on both spells and dragoon transformations, and each character has his or her own unique combinations, which make the game both more interresting and more challenging. The storyline is great, but it resembles the story of FF7 far too much. The cinema graphics make the game look amazing, although the sound effects are often too loud to hear the voices, and in the final cinema the lips arent cyncronized with the words, but overall the game is quite pleasing."
5,time for fun,I love the game and I hope there will be a squeal.at the start no one can tranform but thats okay for then.when you can tracform it is suprising how much mor power ful you become even when you can only tranfor for a short time.druging the game you find lot of supreies and sercrets you find out like shana's if you can put things togerther.
2,3 years in the making a waste of time,After spending my hard earned cash I was expecting a game that would rival that of Final Fantasy. Cinemas were great but the story falls short and the voice acting is almost as good as a B movie from the 70's. The battles get repeatative after having to do the same combos over and over. So aside from some amazing CGI I wouldn't take another look at this game.
4,A must play,"Definitely a game traditional RPG fans should never pass up. If you have the chance to get a copy of this game, go for it."
5,One of the Greatest Games EVER!,"This is by far, one of the GREATEST games EVER. I got this game when I was 5 or 6, I never really got further into the game until I was 9 or so though. I still remember dressing up as the main character and playing around. I have tons of great memories from this game, and wish my copy was in better condition. I would highly recommend buying this game. Easily one of my favorites along with Castlevania: SoTN."
5,Dragoon Heart,"I've always played RPGs ever since I knew what they were. With enough imagination... and a good enough story, you can get into your characters, feel what they're feeling.Legend of Dragoon is one of those games... You're with them every step of the way. As they come so close to victory only to have the finish line moved to the other side of the field. This game is about fellowship and love... and the strength to fight for it to your last breath.As for the combat system itself... it's the only combat interactive RPG that I've played... where your own reflexes determine the success of your character's combos.I give this game 5 stars... and I hope anyone else who plays it can have the same love for it too."
4,One of my Top Ten RPG's,"This game is WAY underated. For a first for sony, they did a kick Butt job on both the story line and game play. There are a few parts that confessed people, but it would not be a RPG with out confession now would there."
5,My review for The Legond of Dragoon,This game is awesome! Im still on the first disk but im really far i just got it last month and Shana is already a dragoon. My guys are really strong both in human and dragoon form. I love the dragoon magic they can do. I think you'll love it too.
5,This game should be number 1!,"This game rocks! From the Graphics to the Additions Battling System. Trust me if you're a begginer like me you'll love this game,because the booklet that comes with it helps you allot and I think this game is user friendly. The story is great. The battling system is Awesome and the Music is ""Wired"". This is my only RPG and I wouldn't have it any other way."
3,Well...,"This game was way to over hyped. I would actually give it 3.5 or 3.2 stars. I found the cinematic scenes to be very good. But, the music is absolutely horrible, game play offers very little, if that no excitement. I mean, this makes the Pokemon battle system look stellar! The plot is a whole different story. From the beginning I could tell what was going to happen, I mean it's really obvious. Guy finds his hometown in ruins, and his childhood ""friend"" is taken capture, so you rescue her. Hey, I'm no critic, but how about a little originality? ... LoD, will make just about anyone give up on it, I did for awhile! Still, this is one that you should try:~("
1,RPG? *snorts*,"I was impressed by what I had heard of this game and I had to play it, I've been RPGing since I was five years old. (I'm twenty now). This game had a refreshing combat system with the boxes and timing and all. But the story line .... I kept watching it just repeat itself over and over. One thing would happen to one person and it would follow suit. The gaining of the gems, the losing of the gems and so on. Gah. That and I've never actually had a game which offended me as much as this one did. The whole thing where every girl in it is helpless and clingy to the 'big strong males' really urked me. Except for Rose, who later obtains the spell 'Death Gate' Which sounded cool as all heck, but it made me actually put the game down for quite a while. This makes you curious if Rose is even really a human female.Blah, I would not suggest this game to anyone. Its an embarrasment."
1,"If I could,I'd banish it to the underworld","My God that game [was no good]!Idon't know what my friend was thinking when he said it was freaking great.He said it was better than a Final Fantasy game.There's not nearly enough spells,the characters speach makes no sense,and it ripped off every freaking RPG I played.An example is the Winglie tribe.They age slowly,just like Nanaki's tribe in FF7.They should pay you to buy this game!Just from the start,when I read the box,I knew it was a dud.The box should come with a warning label stating:""WARNING THIS GAME HAS NO ORIGINAL CONTENT""I don't know how it got a 4.5 average,but I guess some people must've liked it...In fact I'm writing a game with better content than LOD.I call it Cat Up Program(C-U-P).Here the story:Cat crosses a road with no apparent danger.Guide Cat across a road of truth,lies,and magical combat.That in itself has already bested LOD.Good Day"
1,slow loading,"this game loads slower than my grandma walking to the neigbors house. thats slow, and even slower on the PS1"
1,What a piece of ...!,"alright, this rpg isn't bad by most standards. but there are some points that are just unescapeable. like the battle system, suppose to be ""revolutionary"", all it is is just timed button pressing. and the traslation just ..., it's like the dialouge version of a bad dubbed-over japanese monster movie. the fmvs are beautiful, and sure you get to turn into cool dragon people, but it doesn't make up for the poor character development and boring gameplay. this is just four discs of a story with no heart or soul. i stopped playing it before the first disc was over. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
5,You gotta play this!,"The Legend of Dragoon is the first game I have ever beaten. It never got boring while I was playing it, and I noticed that the further into the game you get, the more enemies you find out have been manipulated by another person, who then becomes your new enemy. In this game, there are no levels or stages. And there are NO bonus points. That's what I really like about this game. You'll know what I mean once you play the game( I greatly recommend it)."
5,Legend of Dragoon,"This game is one of the greatest games in the sony gaming history. I gave this game 5 Stars because its a great acton-adventure and rpg game.Thats all i have to say, when you play it, you will understand what im saying!"
4,Very nice,"Legend of dragoon is the closest thing you can get to final fantasy without actually having final fantasy. The characters are interesting and the plot is immensely creative. The combat system needs a little work, though (it relies on well timed button taps and if you don't get them just right, you wind up doing virtually no damage) and some bosses are just a little too hard, even by normal boss standards. This game has countless hours of gameplay, though and once you get into it, i gaurantee your family will be seeing very little of you for quite a while. have fun!"
5,THE BEST RPG EVER MADE!,"This is the best and most unique rpg i have ever played!!!!!!!!!!! The coolest thing(but sometimes frustrating) was the additional system, allowing you to get extra hits. Then, if you completed a certain amount, you got a new one that is more powerful. Of course, this takes a long time to master. Also, the idea of transforming into dragoons was awesome. One of the only problems i found was your limited item space. You can only carry 32 items, even if they are all the same! But don't let this get you down. LOD was even better than FFVII!"
3,Great Game but not perfect.....,"I love RPG's and this one was very good story line, and graphics..The Battle System was like FFVIII limit breaks where you must hit the button every time your character swings his weapon - so for those of you who don't like fighters this may get old unless you buy the Ultimate Wargod Ring. Also you cannot tote as many items as most RPG's let you - so you must learn to battle wisely and guard up when your HP is low. But overall it is a great game. I like to Dragoon out and get my wings going on this one...(32female)"
2,Just no fun :(,"I played this game for several days, because although I was having very little fun from the start, I couldn't identify the reason. Usually, when I dislike a game this much, I always have some overriding reason why, such as ""the story is a bore,"" ""the battles are tedious"", or even ""the graphics are so bad that I can't even see it"". LOD had none of these problems, but I just couldn't get into it. I got all the way up to disc 2, and yet it still felt like pulling teeth just to turn on the PSone, so I put it away and bought .hack. I wound up having a lot more fun, even though that game's story didn't make any sense--go figure. By reading the reviews here, it seems that plenty of other people were disinterested too, so I'm not alone I guess :)"
2,I hate to say it,"I have one thing to say in this games favor, the CG movies rock. With that out of the way I advise you run when you see this game. It just bad, bad translation, bad fighting system, bad ending. I mean ""COME ON!"" if I spend 50 of the ""80"" hours playing this pile o' poo at least let the ending be good. But nooo it had to be as dumb as the rest of the game. Sony needs to look at this game then go to repent. The figting system is just LAME! I can't recall all the times I was sent into a cursing tirade when I did not press the action button in time and my character got slaped silly. The translation is horrible and the story weak at best. A sad, sad game. But if you like cool CG movies and you want to waste some time and money this is your cup of tea."
5,awesome game!,"Brings back a lot of great memories, just an overall fun game to play. Must buy if you like RPGs or played it in the past."
3,I was very disappointed:(,"If you are a diehard RPG fan like i am and you are looking for a GREAT game that you can spend hours on end exploring....this is not the game, sorry. I admit it was a good game but there were ONLY 2 SUB-QUESTS! Unlike the Final Fantasy series, in this game you are unable to explore the world map since your character can only travel along a specified track. And one more thing, i heard this game promised about 100 hours of playing time, i only obtained 32 hours of playing time. I was very disappointed. Although i have to admit once again it was a good game, the graphics were great and the story-line was pretty good, but the game in itself was just too easy:("
4,Great Game!!!,"I'm 19 years old and I used to play this game when I was 12. I had sold it and I regretted it ever since. Being older I can now see more flaws in the game. For example, the dialogue can be a bit childish, and the storyline a bit cheesy at times. However, I bought it online for the memories, and I didn't think twice.The battle system is a good challenge with the addition system. The background art is beautiful. Pretty good storyline cut scene CG art. I would consider the graphics at times to be better then FF7.A memorable game that I'd rate 5 pout of 5 for fun."
5,A classic game.,"Anyone into Final Fantasy games, Shadow Hearts, or other similar RPG's will likely enjoy this as well. The game is on par if not better than Final Fantasy games. You have turn based gameplay, transformations into Dragoons, full motion video cutscenes, and a well done story which lets you control a group of heroes on an epic journey.So you can get an idea of where I'm coming from my top rpg's are (in random order):Final Fantasy 8 and 10Shadow Hearts 1 and 2The Legend of Dragoon- The game is a bit expensive for what I would like to spend for a PS1 game but this is a great classic. To receive it in brand new condition still in the wrapping and as a physical product rather than a digital download is worth it in my opinion. I bought this while it was on sell from Quick Buys it arrived brand new and still sealed. I heard a few people had some problems with the fourth Final Fantasy 8 disc so I put each Legend of Dragoon disc in to make sure they were recognized and everything works great."
5,Beautiful Angel,"This is a beautiful angel! It has been a focal point in my yard. It looks so peaceful and adds a lovely touch to my home. I purchased the angel several months and placed it in my front yard. I had so many positive comments on it. Two nights ago someone stole it. It broke my heart. So if you purchase this beautiful angel, be sure to place it in a place that no one can steal it. I plan to order another one. It is a shame that I cannot showcase it."
3,"Was there an editor, or at least a proofreader?","As a child I loved this book and I recently picked it up for nostalgia's sake. While I still like the illustrations and the story itself, I can't help but notice the frequency of poor grammar and clunky sentence structure. Where were the editors and proofreaders? How did this book make it to shelves without corrections? Anyway, it's still enjoyable... if a bit sloppy."
3,Good information,"At less than fifty pages, a basic biography of this great man that's suitable for intermediate grade students. The basic information is here, his early life, his many interests and contributions, and more than a little focus on his work with electricity. Pretty basic, pretty accurate, gives some sense of Franklin and his times, but is not well suited as an attention-grabber. A youngster having to do a report on a famous American, would do well to start here. It's accurate and readable."
1,Wrong type of controller,"I just want to inform potential buyers that if you are looking at their pictures of controllers and getting the warm fuzzy Nintendo brand item feel then think again. These people very subtly mention that the color AND BRAND may vary. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU WANT A NINTENDO BRAND CONTROLLER. I wanted one and after I clicked purchase I realized that was written there. I e-mailed them about this and heard no reply back. Ohh well, just make sure you read the subtle fine print"
4,Punk and Blues.,Cristina Martinez sings along with a great band who crash out blues riffs to hard hitting punk style drums. This is an underrated album....and it's alot of fun. Give it a chance.
4,Still loving Pearson!,"Another fast paced, engrossing read from Ridley Pearson. I have added the remaining books of his that I have yet to read to my shopping cart (that's the idea, huh, Amazon?). It involved staying up late, being scared, holding my breath, and the like. Although he reuses a few schemes in the book, he is versatile enough to escape the tried and true, mano-a-mano serial slaughterer."
4,BOLDT IS GOOD!!!,"This is a pretty good read. Much better than Angel Maker. Some one is killing people, even whole families. Pearson writes a good story, some places go into to much detail for me, that is the reason for the four instead of a five. All in all I enjoyed the book. Everytime I thought I had it figured out a new twist would show up and here we went again. The book is hard to put down and the ending is very good. I really like the characters of Boldt and LaMoia. They make a good pair."
5,No witnesses,Just finished reading this book yesterday. Ridley Pearson will definitely become an author that I follow. Lou Boldt is a great character.
4,no witness review,THIS IS A TYPICAL LOU BOLDT STORY. IT WAS WELL WRITTEN AND HARD TO PUT DOWN. IF YOU LIKE LOU YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK
4,Intense,A very fast read. From the very beginning Ridley draws you in and keeps your attention. Plenty of twists and turns to make you want to keep reading. Another great book of many I have read by Ridley Pearson .
2,"Please, learn how to write characters!!","Light read (very light), good for rainly weekend, but hard to believe. Daphne never stops getting into those ""tricky"" situations - will she ever learn? Hard to believe one so young and attrative and has climbed the SPD ladder is such a ""jerk"" and can't learn from her previous perils! And Corky, all of 11 years old and obnoxious and still wants a clown selling ice cream at her birthday party - where the guests arrive on their boats to celebrate - I just don't think so - the author hasn't been around children - or is especially clueless about them - no -the author needs to know his characters, he still is a light weight - go Elizabeth George."
5,One Of Mattels Best Barbies Yet,"Absolutely beautiful doll.Much prettier then the first 4 in this series.I recomend her highly.I own all 5 dolls in this Movie Star series and I have to say she is my favorite.""It must be the RED outfit""."
5,Wonderful Nirvana,This is a great cd. Even unplugged Nirvana is great and this is a great contribution from them. I would totally recommend this cd. We miss you Kurt!
3,Flashback Genre,"A good read with uniquely crafted stories from the past intertwined with the present. The genre of the book is flashbacks every other chapter. Put off by this I realized the only way to complete the book was to read the old story in its entirety then read the present story.The first paragraph almost stopped me for the author starts with, ""He climbed down out of the Siskiyous..."". I envisioned someone trekking only to find in the last sentence he was driving a car. Fortunately, similar lapses are rare."
2,opening in top too small,"I bought these shoes because I wear the same size in all my Steve Madden shoes and they do not fit. The problem is that the opening in the top of the boot in much smaller than my foot, so it is almost impossible to actually get my foot into the boot. I did manage to get the left foot in, and I know that the shoe fits because once I actually had my foot in the boot I had plenty of room and it looked cute. My right foot, on the other hand, will not fit into the top of the boot. I guess I will try to put them on again tomorrow but for now I am thoroughly disappointed with the fact that it is a struggle and I can still only get one boot on."
1,don't require this book.,"This book is so boring and awful that haflway through the class I stopped doing the readings. Teachers, please, do not require this book. Your entire class may kill themselves."
3,The,"I had to read this book as a part of a film history class in school. To be honest, I wouldn't have read this at all beacuse of the my lack of interest in the subject, but had to because of a paper i had to write on the topic. The best thing about the book is that it explores a completely different world of filmmaking. It is very detailed and is a good resource on the topic of 3rd world filmmaking. This is a good resource for academic purpopes and if u dig foreign films u should check it out as this is as foreign as it gets."
3,Not bad,Good sound quality for the price. Comfortable cushioned ear pieces. Wish they had seperate volume control. Overall not too bad
5,THE BEST!!,The sound is AWESOME!! I love my new headphones. My husband has a pair and recommended that I get some. I am so glad he made this recommendation.
2,Busted within 6 weeks,"These headphones were sold at a reduced price, and now I know why. One of the channels went out within 6 weeks. It was a total waste of money."
2,Numark Headphones,I bought it and i am not a satisfied customer. I now have to be trying to acquire another headphone.Sometimes it's ok and at other times it's just distorted.
3,Good Product,"Its nice and lightweight, the padding is comfortable. I wish the bass would pickup even more but still sounds great!"
2,OK!!,Not Numarks best product but ay for 11 bucks they sound pretty damn good so if you need some back up Dj headphones there worth the money !
1,"Sound is ""okay"", quality of product not that great.","Bought these in September looking for find some good cheap headphones with good sound quality and, block exterior noises as well as for occasional hobby DJing. They did a great job while they lasted. 4 months later I only have sound out of my right ear. Never yanked on the or mistreated them at all. Just one day stopped working. I'm sure it's a loose wire somewhere inside but coming from Numark I would expect a lot better quality, and not have to take them apart. Comfort above the head is OK, a little uncomfortable when you wear them around the back. Sound is also decent.Would not recommend these even for the cheap price. They can be all okay, but if they break after 4 months it's not worth the money IMO."
3,Numark HF 125 DJ Headphones,"I have been deejaying for over 10 years, and these headphones work great for the price. My only beef with these headphones is I have big ears and they barley cover them. Other than that great sound quality for the price."
3,right ear,"I guess I am gettin the same issue that i see other people getting about this item. The right ear malfunction. Im not a scary buyer though... I bought a second pair. Will update once I get them and let y'all know how pair number two works out. If they work, well I'll just use the 1st pair as backup (I'm a beginner DJ so i only use on ear anyway). Im not a big fan of returning items that are this cheap... I've blown $12 on much worse investments... (lap and table entertainment .. ha ha ha) So its no biggie to me!!"
2,Stopped working after about a week...,I must say I am disappointed. The Right ear went out after about a week of use. The headphones where handled carefully so I can only assume they were defective.
4,nice monitors for this price it works well,I like these monitors. They are all I need to cue up and mix . Great sound and you're not going to find a better price . Get em and you won't be dissapointed.
1,20 Minutes in and RIGHT EAR IS GONE,"These look good, but they aren't of great quality. The right ear faded in like 20 minutes. The ear holes are also really small and it feels really uncomfortable. If you accidentally press the ear part, the sound goes away completely, its like a button that shouldn't be there, maybe somewire gets pressed or something."
1,do not waste your money,"pretty on the outside but the sound is poor, do not waste your money on this product, I have a headphones bought to amazon (Gemini DJX-03 and American Audio HP200) and it sounds much better than this."
4,Nice headphones,"This headphones are perfect for amateur djs and to use with iPod, it has both 1/4 and 1/8, I didnt read that in the description and bought and extra converter."
3,it is ok,"it is ok, at the 3 days of useing it one side doasnt transmit soun, ine freind have the same and he has the same problem, they are not very good quality"
4,Good Deal,"Good headphones for the price. As D.J's we all need back up equipment. You don't wanna be at a party without back ups on everything. I own a set of Pioneer Headphones I use with my Pioneer 1000mk3 which work very well, but these work fine, and it won't leave you broke. Benito Romero. Good Deal. Good Price."
4,OH MY GOSH!,"I am new to tae-bo. I have been using the tapes for about 5 weeks. I purchased tae-bo gold for variety. I am 32 years old and totally love this video. This video states that it is for people over 40. It's very challenging and slightly more mellow than some of his other tapes. But, don't let the title fool you. There are some ""over 40"" people in this video that make me proud to be growing older. There is an older female in this video that is right in the front and kicks her legs higher than billy does! To see this woman work out, it is truely amazing and inspiring. I highly recommend it. I know it's hard to hear billy at times but, he has an assistant that helps you count so that you don't loose track. I feel good when I'm finished with this video."
3,A good way to get BACK started or JUST GET STARTED!,"At 29, I can honestly rave about the tape. I am not in the age range that they targeted this video to, but I bought it. I was attracted by what seemed to be the slower pace and music that I like. Well, I was pleased. Sure it does fluctuate in volume now and again and sometimes Billy is hard to hear, but overall I give it a 3. It's not his best work, but it sure is great and worth the money. I own the original Tae-Bo and find the pace frantic and sometimes jarring. I feel peaceful and like I'm learning the exercises. I work up a good sweat and feel accomplished. I do plan on moving back to the original when I've mastered this, but this tape is a great beginner tape or great for anyone of ANY AGE getting into a workout. You can keep up them...and feel accomplished!"
3,Worth the money...,"I am an over-40 Tae-Bo veteran who found myself bored with the Basic tape and not willing to spend the time needed for the Advanced tape. So I was stuck in the middle until I purchased the Gold tape about 8 months ago. Although Billy is hard to hear at times, the tape is not as jarring as the Advanced and the music is much better than the Basic. I enjoy seeing regular people like myself in the video and the Motown music is a real motivator for me. Others have knocked this tape as a ""sell out"" for Blanks, saying he caved in to popular demands, but isn't that what exercise is all about? If it gets you moving, it's worth it."
1,Toe-Bo gold,"I own three of the Billy Blanks video's. All are really great and I use them daily. I find this one to be both boring and too slow, a total waste of my time. I am 51 and I do fall into the age group that this type was made for. I cannot think of any of my friends who are between 50-60 that would find this type exciting. It should be for age group 70 and up, perhaps even older. Come on Billy, let's put a little more thought into it. Look around, this is 2002. Most of us in our 50's are much more active and in shape than our parents were when they were in at that age. Please, get a little more creative."
4,"A Brillant Masterpiece, by French Newton.","This is an elegant piece of work that was put forth by Laplace, he was the Issac Newton of his era and was one of best physicists and mathematicians of France (besides Pascal and Decrates). The book touches upon the major difficult concepts including celestial mechanics and on his nebular hypothesis; which offered a radical notion concerning the evolution of the solar system and its formation. I would totally recommend this book to anybody who has a particular inquiry on the cohenrent physical world and the acknowledgement on the mathematical level of physics (especially towards astrophysical theorists). From my perspective, this book and Newton's Principa are the one of the best books published in the history of science."
1,Smells like the plastic you cook it in!,"I love rice and really had hopes that this product would be great. Rice can be a pain to make, with this only taking 90 seconds in the microwave, it was really appealing! Really I should have known better though... a product being cooked in a plastic bag is going to come out smelling like plastic. The smell of plastic was pretty stomach turning, couldn't possibly be good for you...."
5,Another Good One,"I'm hooked. Hot Gimmick is a damn good series. The twists and turns just keep coming. If you liked the first three, you'll like this one. Sorry guys! No spoilers!"
3,"Great manga, bad translation","Alright, so we all know that Vol. 1 of Initial D was translated flawlessly, and everybody was happy. TokyoPop must have known this too, because the sales were great. So what we don't know is, why the heck did they screw the rest of the series up? They decided to completely remake the names, who knows why. They butchered the dialogue, and to top it off, they call it '100%' manga. what the H? Though I would like to complain all day about it, the entirety of this review isn't focused only on the translation. The story is great and the illustrations are fantastic (I dont really care much for the character design, but who cares). If I was basing this review on translation alone, I would give it 1 star, and if I was basing it on the manga itself, I would give it 5 stars. So, I merged the two and gave it 3. My suggestion is learn japanese and buy the import mangas. hope this helped some"
4,Soul Provoking,"Allen Bartell has written a book about a trip that I could only dream of. The imagery and feelings that this book evoke are unforgettable. The heat of Texas, the wind and rain, and harsh conditions that one can be exposed to on a mototrcycle are all vividly illustrated on the pages of this book. Throught the pages of Alaskan Abberation I was also exposed to a variety of characters that I would never think of striking up a conversation with. Finally, this is a great book with some great writing and I would recomend it to anyone."
4,How this book changed my life,"Al is one of my very favorite people in the world. His book gave me insight into his soul. The details he uses make you feel like you're riding along in his sidecar, like Schultz from Hogan's Heroes."
1,Not worth being praised as a great bike travel book,"This book was a BIG dissapointment, as it tells you as much about the countryside as a one page holiday brochure! The trip done one motorbike must be one of the most rewarding trips, however if one reads the authors book, it becomes nothing more than a person trying to cover a distance to prove that he can sleep outside in a tent and drive without a helmet.For a good read: ""Jupiters Travel"", ""Bullet up the Grand Trunk Road"", ""Abgefahren"" These authors manage to combine a good storyline, with a travelbook, and give you a insight into their daily lives. I regret buying the book."
2,Disappointed,"I have used earlier versions of CreataCard and have been very pleased with every upgrade. But not this time. While there are many nice graphics, the majority (and in some categories - all)of graphics require you be online to even view them. If you 'paste' the item, then you have to wait while the graphic downloads. Many of the artwork that had previously been on my PC are now only available if I'm online. I have written the company; they acknowledged that the majority of graphics were online and advised me to turn off that feature or to upgrade!!! I told them I wanted my money back."
2,American Greetings CreataCard Gold 8,"Very disappointing. I had been using CreataCard Gold (Copywrite 1997) and was very happy with it. I purchased version 8 hoping for the same user-friendly interface and more professional quality greeting cards with multiple greetings.I found this version's interface to be cumbersome. The size of the cards was too small to see prior to selection. When I scrolled the view kept bouncing backward. The cards were nearly all cartoon quality-- few nice, professional quality like the first version. Most of the cards were accessible only via the Internet. DEFINITELY NOT AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE ORIGINAL CREATACARD GOLD. KNOWING WHAT I KNOW NOW, I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT."
1,CreataCard Gold 8,"I agree with D. Davis (Honolulu). I have been using CreataCard Gold 3 for years and tried the upgrades and gave up on them as they are not a patch on CreataCard Gold 3. I usually like Broderbund products but they need to go back to the drawing board or better still go back to Gold 3I.Renton, Scotland"
2,Create A Card,"I definetly like the Gold 3 version better than Gold 8. My prime reason for changing was the I bought a new computer and Gold 3 was not comaptible with the new software. I used the forget me not reminders the most and 8 simply doesn't match up, and that is really to bad. I don not like that there isn't calendar reminders like there was in 3 and Gold 8 simply isn't as easy to navigate in the reminder area. The shipping aspect was very quick and overall service great."
1,Probably not worth it!,Have bought several upgrades thru' the years and have always gone back to Create-A-Card Gold 3 for it's ease of use and simplicity. Are there improvements I would like to see happen to Gold 3? You bet but I'm not spending any more money on American Greetings software only to be disappointed once again.
1,Creatacard gold 3,Can someone help me out and give me the name of the company that created this Creatacrad gold 3 I would also appreciate the address so i can contact them.Thanks
3,Sun at Midnight,Sun at MidnightA good light read with breathtaking descriptions of the unique and beautiful place Antarctica must be.
3,saved by Antarctica,"The storyline is predictable and far-fetched, and has a film script feel to it, but it is just about worthwhile reading for the wonderfully written descriptions of Antarctica which really seem to capture the essence and wild spirit of the place."
5,Really loved this book,Rosie Thomas books are beautifully written and this one had something else magical about it. I loved the descriptions of Antarctica they were vivid and inspiring.
1,Where's our anniversary?,"I'd never thought about proofreading a calendar, but our wedding anniversary is March 21st. This calendar showed it falling on Wednesday. It's really on Tuesday.There are 2 dates listed as March 18th.Where is the quality control on this product?How do I get a corrected calendar, now that we're in the middle of March?"
1,"nice pictures, but the DATES ARE OFF!!! Don't buy this!!",This Calendar has the ultimate mistake for a calendar:The dates are off! How can that happen?? This company obsiously doesn't proof-read. Pathetic.
4,what forsight,"i love old ""b"" movies and serials. this serial seems like it looks into the future with all the gadgets the villians possess. the acting is bad but lots of the effects are great. television, wireless walkie talkies, and a stun gun. thats pretty impressive for a 1935 picture."
2,Alpha Video - Omega Quality,"Okay, the serial itself is a hoot. A fairly early entry with a feel that talkies have finally arrived -- although it was made in the mid-30s. But what can we do about Alpha? Sure, they make offerings such as these available, when no one else will, but absolutely no effort is made with respect to quality. A grainy, noisy copy of the series was used, and what's with the cropping? You know something's up when the title disappears from the top of the screen. Our hero, and dastardly villains, often have their heads lopped off. I'm not asking for letterbox quality -- not even pan and scan -- but can't you at least get the top and bottom of the frame on the screen? Oh well. If you can pick up a copy for about $5, it's worth it. But remember, you've been warned."
3,I guess you need some artistic skill.,"This would probably be a great book for somebody who was an expert draftsman or some type of commercial artist and only needed to know the stylistic details required for acceptance by the U.S. Patent Office. But for somebody like me, who is very mechanical-minded but has no artistic skill, it would be far easier and perhaps even cheaper to just farm out this work to a professional who knows what he is doing. It is kind of like a book I once bought on engraving... how am I going to engrave a deer into steel with tiny chisels when I can't draw a deer on paper with a pencil to begin with?So a person needs to evaluate themselves honestly. If you are like me, then don't waste your money buying this book in the hope that it will magically transform your abilities or show you some high-tech yet cheap computer software that will do all the work in the correct style with no effort."
3,"OK, not great","This book is not as good as I hoped. It is nowhere as good as Nolo's ""Patent It Yourself.""Lots of components are not shown as examples. (Not a single spring, for example.) They don't have setup information for CAD. No online updates or additional material (like the Patent It Yourself does). Index is not helpful.I would have liked to see a reference table that lists, say 50 types of drawing, and for each type, a list of patents that the reader could look at for more examples.I would like to see a CAD symbol library -- even a small one.I would like to see a ""List of Common Mistakes"" and suggestions on finding and managing drafting agencies.Still, not bad for complete beginner."
3,Assumes you know zero about drawings,"I thought this book was a little long for the subject and content. Chapters two and three were relating to computer drawings and pen and paper drawings and it just was mainly unnecessary. The author really assumes you know zero about technical drawings, like crayons and chalk on the sidewalk - zero. The author literally teaches you how to trace a picture!There are some good chapters that really deal with the patent drawings. The main things you want to take home are formats, labels, and how and why you need to respond to Patent Office objections and rejections.The book is over 200 pages and you'll likely read about 100 of them.So it if you need a book that assumes you know zero, this is a five star book, if you've been around the block with any form of technical background its a 2.5-3.0 star book."
2,Fuzzy but not pretty,"The blanket was nice to feel but the quality of the art was not clear and distinct like in the photo. Overall, I would not recommend this blanket."
5,A wonderful experience,"I purchased this tape after attending one of Aretta's life purpose workshops. I have listened to it almost everyday, and it has really helped me to gain insight. While using this meditation, my mind has come up with many ideas that have led me closer to my purpose. I appreciate the insight and clarity I've gained by using this meditation. Thank you so much Aretta, you have made such a difference in my life!"
4,Great Little Program,"For those who hate Outlook and its bareness, this is the program to get. It's easy, intuitive, comes with great features which you probably will never explore totally. Definitely recommended purchase."
1,Very buggy software,"Many bugs. Dialog boxes have garbage in them. Edits are sometimes ignored. Font list has many duplicates. Text is improperly kerned (uneven spacing). Save to PDF driver can hang, requiring a re-boot. Etc, etc..."
3,Good Product !,Very easy to use and customize. A little problem with listing multiple events in one day but overall a very good product. Would recommend.
2,Frustrating,"In order to use this software it seems one would need to have a degree in graphic information technology and I'm not sure even that person would be able to use it. The company provides no support for persons having difficulty using the program and the ""Help Center"" is not structured in a useful manner."
1,Calendar Creator,I did not like the fact that I had to insert the disk for clip art. I went back to Calendar Creator 9.0
3,A solid if difficult record to listen to,"This album lacks one major thing that makes any sonic youth album as great as they are. The element of free feeling. this album lacks what most sonic youth albums nail so well,the free style and experimentation. The album sounds as if the members of sonic youth are holding their noses just a bit. the songs are difficult to get into and listening to the entire opus is a challenge. Let the truth be known;what's good on this record is very good indeed(the song washing maching is a great example of what all of the songs could have been)and there are many highpoints on the record. This is an excellant record for any other band but,coming from sonic youth it sounds a bit lackluster. this point is even more evident since this record came after the brilliance of ""experimental jet set."" For new sonic youth fans pick up ""sister"" or Thurston Moore's solo record ""psychic hearts."""
2,Mostly Directionless,"OK, this is where I got off the SY bandwagon once and for all. Jet Set Etc. was bad enough, but this was the pits, and I wasn't going to sit around pretending that these languid, aimless ditties had any worth (of course with the usual caveat - The Diamond Sea is amazing). This was a once great and powerful band whose creative faculties had utterly dried up, and this is from a huge erstwhile fan. So I just tuned SY out of my life for over a decade, til a friend recently lent me Sonic Nurse and I found they had inexplicably found a new lease on creative life.Anyway, the 2 stars are for Diamond Sea, the rest of the album is sonic (and lyric) garbage."
4,worth buying,i have gone back to this one many times almost exclusively based on the merits of the last two songs. Skip tracer is probably one of the best sonic youth songs lyrically: it is both clever and poignant; diamond sea is well transforming. Unwind is a distant third but I find the lyrics are mildly limp. Right now this and Murray St are the two sonic youth cds to which i am listening most frequently
3,Hmmm...,"I own this CD. And I enjoy aspects of it. Some of it, I may not like the SOUND, but I appreciate the band and what they have contributed to indie rock/experimental music/art rock.I only gave this one 3 stars because 1)I only like half the songs so I wouldn't give it 5 based on my own tastes, and, 2)it's hard to rate experiemtnal/art rock like Sonic Youth. So I'll take a stand back from my own likings to rate this just as it is.There are some high points to this. Like others have said, The Diamond Sea is a really cool piece, and the way in morphs and changes is just gorgeous. Very cool.I think a lot of people are quick to dismiss bands like Sonic Youth as ""garbage"" without realizing there's a difference between not liking the sound of a band and APPRECIATING what they've contributed. Sonic Youth isn't for everyone, but they deserve some praise for the way they strip down music and experiment with different sounds and ideas. Cool stuff, overall."
4,a stage in their evolution,"I bought this on pre-recorded cassette not too long after it first came out, so I could listen to it in my car (in the days before car CD players were common). I was already firmly into SY, my life forever changed by Daydream Nation and Dirty. I have kept up with the band since then, and recently picked up this album in CD format. Looking back now, I see how it was a stage in the band's evolution, from earlier noise-rock to more extended compositions. Diamond Sea is worth the price of the CD alone. I think this is the missing link between the Daydream (and earlier)/Dirty stage to the Thousand Leaves stage (their finest hour ??). A must for serious fans, and not a bad starting place for the curious."
3,Lee shut up!,"I find Lee Renaldo to be the curse of SY. Who told him he can sing? or recite poetry for that matter. Kim and Thurston rule this group!!! Standouts: Washing Machine, Diamond Sea, Panty Lies. Someone choke Lee, he is annoying my braincells!!!"
1,"Um, did I listen to the same album?",This was the last Sonic Youth album I purchased. I did not like this one at all. Go buy Daydream Nation.
5,It grabbed me. I read it in one shot.,"I found the book on a table at a university library. The title interested me and I read the first couple of pages. I was hooked. At first, I was amused by the interests and high school life of the protagonist, Arthur Parkinson. I thought,""Hey, just like my high school."" Then I began to appreciate the layering that experiences and events had on the individual character's perspective. I also like the meandering fashion the story had. Events take place linear, concurrently, overlapping and intersecting at the most interesting places, just as life happens. Take any small town tragedy and you'll find more twists and turns than you would have ever imagined. Mr. O'Nan's story took on the complexity of this situation and grounded it in Arthur, a character many people will identify with."
2,recipe for disaster,"take one wet firecracker ending wrapped in a raymond carver impersonation with a dose of rick moody's ""ice storm"" thrown in. puree, flambee, mince, serve. you'll only want one helping. i did."
4,Worth it's weight and its weight was heavy....,"Snow Angels was an unexpected and welcomed diversion, dense and thoughtful, heavy and sad, but always worth the read. Dismissing this book becauuse it packs a despairing wallop is wasteful; give yourself a little time to experience the saddness and you'll feel all the more human. Doesn't fall in my top ten, but maybe the top 25 of recent reads. A very worthwhile investment of time."
2,Not enjoyable,Very disappointing. The back and forth between the two families made very little sense. I was definitely disappointed as this author was recommended on a valued program I listen too. As this is the author's first attempt it could be that he improves over time.
1,TERRIBLE,This book is not worth anyone's time. It is page after page of O'Nan retelling the depressing lives of several completely dysfunctional people. I was required to read it for school -how terrible- and constantly found myself doing the math to figure out how many pages I had left. I have no sympathy for any of the pitiful characters- they are not worth my time. A waste.
1,Why isn't there a no star rating.,It didn't work out of the box. I spent some time trying to figure out what I was doing wrong. The unit kept causing a USB overload conditon on two separate computers. I finally realized that the cable itself caused an overload. It must have been a short in it. Needless to say the unit went back directly and was replaced by one at a local store.
4,Happy but...,"I like the product I guess. I lost a hard drive, so when I reinstalled a new one, I bought this to have as a backup of the hard drive. The only thing I don't like is that I have to plug this directly into the USB port, no extensions...that means that I have to make a extra effort to run this only by itself...that means I don't run the copy as often...but I bought another backup system as well, so I'm covered."
4,A good addition to Corduroy's colletion,I love lift the flap Corduroy goes to school. So I purchased this one as an addition. The quality of the book is exceptional.My child enjoys this book a lot. Though I think the story of Corduroy goes to school is better.
5,Shipped fast and I got a lot of product for my money,"I received this floor cleaner quickly, and it works very well on my bamboo flooring. And I got more than twice as much of it for the money as I would have if I had purchased it from a local store."
4,Very Sexy,"A little high for me to walk in all day. However, will definitely serve it's purpose for a couple of hours. I love the soft leather of the shoe. I also received many compliments when I wore them, that made it all worth the less than $30 that I paid for them."
5,Erica Asahan Top 10 Shoes,"Erica Asahan wrote:This is not purple or grey, but it is super hot and elegant, and you noticed that it's Bandolino, meaning it's very comfortable! You would love it!"
1,PSI Woodworking 220v Dust Collector Switch,Nothing good to say about this. I think is is a piece of junk. Only lasted about 30 days before it stopped working. Wouldn't recommend it.
4,Long Ranger works well,"This is my second 220V Long Ranger switch. My first unit went belly up after about 3 years of light-to-moderate use. The remote was still good, though, and I had no trouble reformating it for use with the new unit, so now I have 2 remotes, which is quite convenient. Setting up the Long Ranger is easy, the range is good, the 9V battery in the remote lasts a very long time, and it works consistently without problem. My only concern is how long my new unit will last, given the history of the old unit."
5,Long Ranger LR220,"I was having a problem with access to my 3 HP compressor, no matter when I needed the compressor, it was always off. I would have to reach over what ever was in front of it with a long stick, trying to reach the switch. Now all I have to do is push the remote on, and my compressor is doing it's job. The unit the remote controls, is wired with a heavy gaged wire, don't go cheep!!!!! by buying a lesser product, I almost bought one. I did the research, and found the wire size was to small, and could over heat!!!! with possible fire!!!!!! if used for long periods of time. Not a good combination with dust, electricity, & wood. The long Ranger is everything I was looking for, convenience, well built, reliable & safe, you can't ask for anything more.Trent LutzHillsboro OR"
5,I can be in two places at one time,"I do CNC woodwork. One remote is placed on my computer table for the CNC and easily turns the dust collection system on and off; the other is mounted with velcro under the on/off switch for my table saw. Other than replacing batt's once, these have never failed to provide great service. May buy another for my jointer planer because I'm too lazy to turn around and hit the one on my CNC table."
5,"Very nice, but check your machine","This product came and worked as expected with clear and simple instructions. Unfortunately, my 230 volt dust collector came with a motor controller push button unit that does not hold the last switch position with the power off (a safety feature). Consequently, it will turn off using this remote switch but will not restart without manually pushing the ""on"" button. You can test your unit by turning it on and pulling the electric plug, and putting the electric plug back in the outlet to see if it restarts when energized."
2,"Works great, but life span is too short.","I purchased two of these switches over the years and both have failed after about 1.5 to 2 years of use. I called PSI after the first one failed and was told I got the useful life out of it, and that I'd have to purchase another one as they cannot repair them. I might add that the second unit has not seen alot of use since I purchased it in Aug. 2006."
4,Donkey Kong Country,"It was a great game, though the graphics [are bad]. Overall though it was very fun and I would strongly recommend it for anyone who likes adventure games."
4,pretty good game,"this is a pretty good game as the title I gave my review might have suggested. I thought this was a bit better from some of the other older Donkey Kong Games for Game Boy (especially the ones that weren't in color). It keeps you interested for a long time, and it's a good buy. The only thing is, that even though it's a good game, to me, it just isn't worth 5 stars."
1,sucks,this is the worst donkey kong game ever i mean if i werent 10 id curse out who made the game but i wont
1,Worst Interpretation EVER,"I owned this game when i got a game boy advance and I can tell you: IT SUCKED!!!Graphics 0/10- Terrible Graphics. Even an arcade game would have better graphics. other GBC Games would have better graphics. I am disgusted.Music 0/10- They screwed up the music and put other stuff in the game.Game Play -5/1000- harder and less fun.Overall -5,000,000/10- Stay away from it."
5,One Of The Best Games Ever Made!!,"My little brother has this game. I played his, and it is just like the SNES game. I LOVE it. I have got to get one. If you have a game boy and love the SNES Donkey Kong Country One then this game is a MUST have."
4,I love donky kong country,I think donky kong country is a really fun game. The first levels of donky kong country are really easy but then they get really hard. You never run out of levels to play. I think you should buy it.
5,This game ~ROCKS~,Well starting out this review I would like to say this game is ~COOL~. I got this game a couple days ago and I beat it in 3:16 min. It's still fun after you beat it because you still got to get 101% and I haven't gotten that much. The graphics are like the same as the one for SNES and the sound is pretty good too but I don't like how it saves after you beat a level it just makes it too easy. The bonus levels are also pretty good but the graphics arn't that good in them except for the sniping game. Their are also different options like DK Barrels off/on or Save Barrels off/on which means you have to beat the game three times. You also need to get all the stamps to get up to 101% well I'm not going to say anymore or I might give the rest away. I would recommend this game to anyone.
2,Play the snes version,Ok not 2 brag but I can beat the snes 1 soo good and its not 2 hard but the Gameboy color is way 2 hard 4 me I can't beat the 3rd world the jungle 1 probly cause the graphics r not 2 clear there way 2 blurry compared 2 other snes and GB games I'm not saying I judge a game buy the graphics but this has the worst graphics I've ever seen in my life!!!I don't reccommend this game unless u collect donky kong games.
2,I regret it...,"I should have waited for the GBA version. Some musics are changed, controls are harder, graphics horribles and the gameplay is a little bit... gay. Too easy to die. I'll probably buy the GBA version if its price become lower."
3,Good but should have been a GBA game,"This game is an ok remake of the SNES classic, but it falls short of its expectaions. Of course, Donkey Kong Country was an excellent SNES game so that's why I give this game the three stars but nothing more. The 8-bit GBC just can't handle the 16-bit game, and that's why the graphic quality and much of the sound is greatly diminished. The blurry visuals makes it hard for one to play the game during various levels ( the mine cart races come to mind) so its just not fun to play like its SNES cousin. Sure, there are some new minigames to play, but overall the experience is pretty much the same. Unless you're a Kong fanatic and want to relive this experience again, don't bother with this mediocre game. A note to Nintendo and Rareware, please just stick to the NES-to-GBC translations, and save any more SNES game remakes for the much more powerful Game Boy Advance."
5,Nothing could be improved,"Even though i finished the SNES version, it is to long ago to remmember, so it's like playing a new game. Graphics are great, gameplay that is very addictive. Everyone should get this game"
2,Fun game... Slow system,"It's time that Nintendo realized that their Game Boy system needs to be upgraded. Rare did a good job before with their original game squeezing 32 bit technology into the 16 bit Super Nintendo. Unfortunately they had to remove some of the best features that made this game so popular: Superb stereo soundtrack and both characters on the screen at the same time. There are also many places in which the game slows down significantly because the poor little Game Boy can't take more than 5 moving characters at once. The playability also seems to have declined. If you have long since gotten rid of your old Super Nintendo, why not download some Super Nintendo Emulators from Plasticman.org and get the ROM and play it exactly the way it was presented in 1994? Not as compact, but you get the idea."
3,only for newlyweds,Not much value or excellent concepts in part 2 & 3 of the disk while the latter is more like ordinary porn clips than educational video. Only ok for newlyweds.
1,Are You Kidding Me??,"It's bewidering that people actually part with MONEY for this! Buy it and you will receive: Very Poor QualityVery Unappealing Sex ""demonstrations"" including bi-racial sexVery Poor narrationEven unappealing cover art. It amazes me that some people really pay for such poorly produced content. If you don't want to take my word for it then remember this review and realize later I really warned you and every element of what's been said is as true as truth."
3,not what I wanted,"Product is fine, but was not what I wanted. I tried to return, but shipping cost more than original product. Seller was great, but offered no help with return shipping or return process. Disappointed, but that's how it goes with internet buying."
5,Bathroom Scale,"At first it was a little intimidating trying to figure out the calibrations, but, once entered and knowing the sequence to get on the scale....it works like a charm."
3,Came with dead battery -- so add $4 to price,"This scale came with a dead battery (which later cost us $4 to replace and a trip to the store in the midst of the Christmas crowds). It took awhile to figure out what the problem was, since it was a new product; we thought we were messing up the setup or maybe it was defective. All in all, kind of a hassle...isn't Amazon supposed to help us avoid trips to the store?"
3,OK..Not AMAZING!,"It was a very entertaining read, with lots of great points of view. but there were times were I felt like it dragged on and kinda of wanted to just read ahead already!"
4,God and Golf,"There's the old joke about Moses and God playing golf - which can't be repeated here - and this book makes it happen! I was delighted with the cast of golfers that show up to play the narrator, a sort of All-Time Open. The structure is fascinating, both obvious and always surprising. Mr. Mitchell's knowledge is exceedingly wide, and his wisdom is deep. A great choice for Father's Day, for Dads Who Think."
4,Great story line.,Theme and interpersonal reflection makes this a great read. Captivating and an easy read. Takes introspective look at the game and one's own personal values and the importance of smelling the roses as one goes through life instead of becoming preoccupied with the end results. Enjoy the journey as you attain the ends.
2,"good story but ""not a movie""","I bought this at wal-mart yesterday... animated X-Men movie for $15 with a story by Joss Whedon?!? Hells yeah!That's where the good ended... it's not a movie at all it's a motion comic. Basically they scanned the comic panels into a computer & used photoshop to turn, angle & warp the image to give it the appearance of really crappy animation.Then they remove the word bubbles and hire voice actors. The voice acting was not half bad but nobody in their right mind would pay $15 for a movie that is just comic panels flashed on the screen while people read the text. At least when they did it for the Watchman graphic novel it was during the watchmen hype when the movie was out AND they said straight on the package it was a motion comic.... this is just shameless money grubbing and nowhere on the packaging does this say anything about being a motion comic.I made it through the first episode but they couldn't even make the credits smooth... this is going back tomorrow morning."
2,Good animation but low on substance,"This show is animated well but it doesn't have enough movement and could've moved faster, Beast looks stupid and cat-like and this movie's main antagonist looks very stupid. If you want to watch a good animated marvel cartoon show, watch the Black Panther one that Marvel Knight did. It's ten times better than this pile of mediocrity. 5/10"
1,Not Animation,"This was horrible!Someone took a great comic book, cut the images up and distorted them instead of animating them. It was UNWATCHABLE CRAP! If you really want to experience this movie bend the comic page back and forth and maybe cut out the eyes to move."
1,not worth getting,"do remember the old school shows ike reading rainbow? where they show a monster or something and it just rocks back and forth across the screen and thats how the characters move across the screen, this is one step up from that! this 6 episode mini series was aweful! there were a few good lines in there it had potential but the fact that it's a motion comic made it terrible!i could not stand watching it and barley watched it all! i almost stopped and during the first episode!"
4,One of the greatest modern X-Men Stories,"Title says it all, with a story like this its hard to go wrong. There's couple of spots where the animation is not quite spot on or where the action gets a little confusion (the riot during the final chapter?) but overall this is a great interpretation. Definitely a must see for X-Men fans."
1,JackO,"I wanted wheel function and optical was the rave so seemed the way to go, but this item needs some work. I had this MS version (which did not fit me ergonomically -- right handed) and the Logitech version (which did) and they were both vitual peripatetic wonders on the screen, jigging here and there at their own apparent will like dogs on a leash. I used the PS2 port; didn't try USB. Did try various surfaces -- wooden desktop, mousepad, paper, etc. -- but nothing cured the problem. Tried convincing myself that I just needed a new system but couldn't buy it. Returned them both and have settled on a Logitech cordless ball version, which works great."
2,unreliable,"I bought this mouse because I thought it would last longer the the standard ball mouse. Unfortunately, 6 months later it was in the trash. From now on, I'll stick w/ the cheap ones that at least last a year. On the posirive side, I did really like the ""back"" button for power browsing."
1,If you play games this mouse suck,Hi i dont speak really good english i live in mexico city and i buy the intellimouse only for play games like unreal tournament and the mouse just dont work. the mouse looks cool and works good only for internet no games
2,How.......Politically Correct.......,"Okay. So it's better if you are left-handed and/or have smaller hands. If I was left-handed, I would not be happy with the release of this mouse. I would be angry at Microsoft for not making their Explorer in a left-handed variant. I hate the thumb button on each side - there is no hope of using the opposite side button, except with your ring finger or pinky (as I keep my middle finger on the wheel and ring on the right-click). Also, the thumb buttons are poorly positioned and very loose, and I found myself accidnetally depressing them at unwanted times (which, depending on how they are programed, can be VERY bad in a game). If you are left-handed, okay. If you are looking at this mouse instead of the Explorer because you have small hands, try the Logitech MouseMan Wheel Optical. At least that's blue. They freakin took away the keen grey finish from the explorer!"
4,no sticks!,"i love this mouse, the price is a bit to high for my taste but since it didn't seem to be dropping anytime soon i went ahead and bought one. what a difference! the track ball mice seem so impractical after using this one. the shape of the intellimouse offers some comfort to your hand when you use it, and the best part is, there is no ball to get stuck when you are trying to make graphics! also the side clicks make browsing the internet less frustrating, i no longer have to use the back button in internet explorer when i want to return to the previous page.i gave this product 4stars because of the price, i would look into the logitech version before making my final decision as that one seems to be a lot cheaper."
5,Excellent for 3d games,"To the reviewer who said it's lousy for games....I beg to differ. I play Half-Life Team Fortress Classic (mostly as a sniper) and the accuracy and response speed is unmatched by any ball based mouse that I've used. This is the mouse 3d gamers have been waiting for. As much as I hate the company Microsoft, I have to commend them with this great product."
4,So close!,"From a hardware standpoint, this is one great product. I had an old Kensington 4-button Thinking Mouse and while I loved that mouse, I was getting tired of the routine cleaning involved. With no ball to get the innards of the mouse dirty, the Intellimouse optical was a dream come true. For desktop use, its great, and when combined with a Ratpad, gaming is a top-notch experience. Microsoft's Intellipoint software falls short though. Kensington's software for their thinking mouse yielded many functions, allowing the ""chording"" of mouse buttons (when you hit 2 of the 4 buttons at the same time) to execute different tasks. If Microsoft decided to offer greater flexibility with their mouse through intelligent software like this, no force in the world would keep me from giving it 5 stars."
5,Superb peripheral,Microsoft gets it right with this one. The most accuratepointing device I've used (including tablets and pens). You MUST haveit. END
3,Great Value,"... This mouse is a great value. It's really nice but it's made for either hand (so not that ergonomic). If the button on the right side was just a little more toward the front, I'd give this mouse an extra star (but my finger doesn't rest on the button and it's awkward pressing it). The other buttons are ok though."
4,Great Mouse --- With One Fault,"I purchased this mouse because my previous mouse with a mouseball had not been functioning very well. I love the accuracy of the optical light, it's really good for a serious gamer. The only fault is the two side buttons -- they would be fine, but have been placed too far up on the side of the mouse. I found myself constantly accidentally clicking them and finally had to disable them both. The product info says that there are 5 programmable buttons, but that includes the regular left- and right-click and the wheel click. Don't get me wrong, it's a great mouse, but there are better alternatives available at Amazon. I have the Logitech MouseMan Wheel Optical on my other computer and I like it so much better. It only has one additional button, but it is perfectly placed. Buy the other mouse, it's more comfortable and isn't any more expensive."
4,Great mouse but.......,"I don't know if it's me, but I have gone 3 of these in 2 years. I love the way it works amd feels, but they just keep breaking."
1,Great....for a week.,"When they work they are great. However. This is the second IntelliMouse Optical that I have bought, and again it stopped working after a week or so. I have friends who have bought these and are having the same problems."
4,Mixed blessings,"I love the speed and convenience of no mouse pad. Under Windows 2000, software must be installed first. A minor inconvenience is having to reconfigure after each reboot. I like the forward, backward use of the sidebars, but I do no like the wheel. It seems to me jerky, but I do not like track balls either. I like the cheery, red glow at rest. All in all, I am pleased with its performance."
4,Brought me back to a mouse,"Maybe it is the full size hand form -- you just rest your whole palm on top -- or just its good shaping, but after years of sore wrists, I'm back to using a mouse. My substitute had been the track balls and other alternative input devices but none seemed to match the mouse's easy of use. The 'optical' also eliminates the mouse pad (yes, no more gifts please) and the shuffling you have to often do in order to get traction. Very good product and none of the wrist cramping."
4,Great Mouse,Great mouse. All other mouses (or is it mice) feel awkward after using this. Only problem I had was the sensor screwed up (the light wouldn't come on) after using the mouse for about 6 months (maybe it's just me).
3,Be aware laptop user,"I just got this mouse from amazon today, and I am disappointed. My laptop has only one USB port, and I connect the mouse to the PS/2 port, and it's working very very bad. Even a very slow movement could cause your cursor jumping all around your screen and keep pressing the right botton. I have tried several times and only the USB port works with the mouse.If your laptop has a IBM thinkpad, you have to disable that in order to use the wheel (Mircosoft said you need to contact your manufacturer to find out how, check out their website). It finally took me an hour before I started using it. I need to use my Windows 98 CD for the mouse configuration, and I don't know if the CD included is useful.But after all, it works great. The bottons in both sides are very useful if you take advantage of it. It's little bigger than the standard mouse though."
1,Back/forward buttons don't work in Netscape on Windows ME,"I really liked using this mouse - in fact I got so used to its back/forward browser buttons that I got really pissed when I discovered they don't work on Netscape on my new Windows ME computer. Microsoft acknowledges the problem (KB Article ID: Q274796) and asks me to wait patiently for a fix, or to return it for a refund... So if you plan to use it on ME with Netscape, you better wait until Microsoft fixes this problem."
1,lasted 3 weeks,I was very happy with my mouse for 3 weeks and then it began to act strange. The cursor would take off by itself or not move at all. I tried removing and reinstalling the software but it quit working at all. I even tried it on a different computer and it still would not work. I can't find anything in the Microsoft knowledge base or help about the problem.
3,"Hmm, great mouse... but","Well, I have another review where I gave it 5 stars, and up until today its been a great mouse. But when I sat down to use it tonight all of a sudden any movement faster than average scrolling makes it jitter (not to be confused with how it perviously was where it took a sharp flick of the wrist to cause this). This usually meant that there was a cat hair stuck to where the lens was, but when I looked there was nothing there, I tried cleaning the lens but it didnt help at all. I'm not quite sure what happend, there dont appear to be any scratches on the lens, and It hasnt been dropped. Anyway, this mystery failure means im gonna have to drop only 2 stars, since I dont think anyone else has shared my misfourtune. You should know that up until now this was an excellent mouse, in my mind, the perfect mouse, at least for me. Im gonna go grab the rubbing alchohol again and see if for no particular reason it works after that."
2,Surface flaked off,"I got this rolling pin a year ago from Kohls. Loved it at first and then I noticed little slivers of ""silver filings"" in my sugar cookie dough! Finally I discovered it was coming from the rolling pin - I don't know what the surface is made of but I won't use it again. I threw out the dough and cookies and had to make new. I don't recommend it for this reason and rolling pins can be expensive - I'm going to look for a marble pin and invest in a good one this time."
5,KitchenAid Nonstick Rolling Pin,"This is by far the best rolling pin I've used. I was first impressed with the weight of this pin. Excellent. Pie crust will not stick to this pin while rolling. Hightly recommend, what's $20 of the best rolling pin ever?"
2,"This ""nonstick"" rolling pin isn't ""nonstick""","I bought this rolling pin because I was baking sugar cookies for the holiday season. I wanted to use cookie cutters, but didn't have a rolling pin. I figured that since this said ""nonstick"" and it was more expensive than its competitors, it was better in quality and wouldn't stick to the dough (which was worth the extra money by itself).The cookie dough DID stick to this rolling pin. I tried covering the rolling pin in flour but the flour wouldn't stick to it (go figure!). It's sturdy and very functional as a rolling pin. Just don't make the mistake I did of thinking it won't stick to cookie dough."
3,Dough still sticks...,"I had high hopes for this rolling pin, especially after years of working with a crummy lightweight wooden one. However, although this one was definitely easier to work with (and stuck less) than my old one--and is very nice looking and priced well too--the dough still sticks to it. I've tried numerous cookie dough recipes at this point, and there are still little bits of dough that stick to the ""nonstick"" surface. You can't really do anything about them except pick them off, because flour doesn't stick to this rolling pin. I also found that although this rolling pin is heavier than my old one, I still have to work pretty hard to roll out chilled dough. So, I'm returning this and looking for another one--maybe marble."
2,Definitely not nonstick,"I bought this rolling pin because I was disgusted with my old wooden pin. When I took it out of the box I liked the weight of it and that the handles are high up so you don't roll your fingers. But nonstick it is not. I have to use wax paper and lots of flour and even then it sticks just as much if not more than the wooden one. It is easier to clean and it's nice-looking, that's about all I can say for it."
5,"""stunning and original""","Everytime I watch Robotech, I get a warm fuzzy feeling inside. This is and was a truly remarkable show, that has truly changed the way the US views anime, and shows with long running storylines. If you like sci-fi, anime, or just a show with wit and intelligence, do not allow yourself to live and die without viewing this rare gem. This show has more continuity and drama than Star Wars (respectfully) and Star Trek could ever wish to have, buy it, watch it, share it with your friends, you wont be sorry and your life will forever be changed-Ayzaic ps: Dont forget to read the books for even added enjoyment,depth and understanding"
5,"Blue Rythms, White Lies","I have played the CD at least once a day since I bought it the day I saw the Groove Hogs in WI. A very jazzy/blues sound. I enjoyed them as much, if not more, than Hootie and the Blowfish."
5,Awesome! Awesome!! Awesome!!!,I have never really been into anime all that much but when I watched this one I was blown out of my seat.It always had me wonding what was going to happen next especially at the end.Great great series.
1,in my opinion,"Well, dont trust the other reviews before you buy this if you want to watch a good anime that has above average details. THIS anime blew my mind... in a bad way. characters and animation are well done but the story of the characters pissed me off and arritated me. What i mean is that how can a little boy which seems to me like 4 to 6 years old kinda ""become"" like a teen or adult relationship with a android within the story. I mean his older brother should have been the person to awaken KURUMI but things started not to make sense.If you want to buy this anime, i suggest watch some clips and parts of this movie before you want to buy it. Some parts of the story is entertaining without the main characters but overall, this killed it for me of the whole series."
1,the 40 year old sex kittens,"this is hard to watch the women in this video are so old and trying to be sexy.There's only 1 chick that is superhot and young, but she appears in the movie for about 2 or 3 minutes and that's the best part of it."
4,Shadoogie!,"Listen, - i have to make this quick!Simply put,- if you're of an age where 'The Shadows' evoke happy memories of posing in front of the mirror, holding your cricket bat like it was a guitar and practicing that Shadow's signature step forward, step back routine that was the hallmark of their live (almost) appearances, while a scratchy 'parlaphone' 45rpm vinyl single blared out on some tinny dansette record player, - you're going to love this album.Not every re-interpretation is an instant winner, but a majority are.If you're at all like me, these instrumentals will be evocative enough to have you smiling, laughing and toe-tapping......and wondering where that 'Shadows Golden Greats' Album is hiding now anyway. Don't miss this one. (oh and put away the cricket bat, a tennis racket works better anyway)"
3,HIT AND MISS,"Reknowned guitarist covers of Shadows favourites, with varying degrees of success.I feel many have tried too hard to be different.Beautiful and tasteful renditions from the likes of Messrs Green, Knopfler and Young, (as one might expect).Others disappointing though."
5,Educational,I'm a k teacher and boought this for center time. The kids fight over it. Very enjoyable and fun.
5,Fun Toy for Ages 2 to 10!,"Just recently received these AlphaMagnets. Bought it for my 2 and a half year-old. As soon as she started playing with it, my 10 year-old joined in for fun. They enjoy playing with it on the refrigerator door several times a day! It's a great buy! Though I feared the letters may be too big when I ordered it, they're actually a perfect size for my preschooler. Sturdy plastic too."
1,Magnets only latest a few weeks.,"I bought these May 10, 2012 and they already have lost their magnetic ability. The magnets came loose and fell back into the letter and are too deep now to stick. I recommend trying another brand!"
2,Just OK,"I bought this because of the size. I wanted to make sure to get letters that would not cause a choking hazard on my young toddler. The size is great, which makes these letter easy to manipulate by little hands. But beware that some of the magnets can come loose, creating a huge hazard. I only had this happen on one letter. And it was loose on arrival. No other letters have had that problem since. But be careful to inspect every letter very carefully and do not leave your child unattended with these."
4,Helpful IP Address ANDing and Subnetting,"This was very helpful in my recent Networking class, I ended the class with an ""A"" with the help of this book. IP Addressing explained every step in the IP Addressing, ANDing, and Subnetting process."
1,totally bad recording,[...]wrote a review which gave me the idea to buy this dvd. But guess what? It is hardly a dvd. It flashes all the time. Sometime the picture disappears altogether. Dvd I think means that you get to see how the instrument and Tabla are being played and are not to be disturbed by the flashes of dark spots. Total disappointment. Bought it from NUTRAJ BOOKS. Will not recomment it to anyone to buy it. Please do not even bother.
2,Just call Kwikset,"I also needed an emergency indoor key that were lost in my house. I eventually called kwikset and ordered 20 keys for almost nothing. $5.00 in shipping is ridiculous. The key itself was fine, just overprice shipping."
2,Door Key,"I guess it's my fault but nope... the key doesn't even fit in my door knob but like my friend came over and used a bobby pen and the door opened right up so if anybody has this same problem just use a bobby pen, you don't even need the door ""key""."
1,Don't make the mistake I made,"I didn't look closely enough at the picture of this product. It is a rectangular key and my interior doors have round key holes. So a penny for the key and $6 shipping. My fault, but a complete waste of money and I still have no keys for the interior doors."
1,ONLY ONE KEY!!!!,There was another reviewer on here that says you got 5 keys. NOT TRUE!!!You only get ONE key!!!What a rip off!!!
3,Modestly appealing young adult fare,"I'm a great admirer of O'Dell, and have read more than few of his books; this out-of-print title is a modestly successful historical piece set on a ficitious Pacific island off the Southwestern U.S. coast. It features a tyrannical father, an independent and resourceful heroine, two black mambas, lots of gold, and the usual winsome and authentic historical ambience that has made O'Dell so reliable. Worth grabbing if you can find it reasonably cheap."
5,Canine Life Jacket!,"I've purchased this lift jacket for my daughter's dog, for Christmas... I won't know until next summer if her dog likes it or not, however I think that any product that Guardian Gear makes should be superior.. I still have to ship the vest to CO. yet, but from the looks & feel of it, I'm sure this will last a long time .. It has adjustable straps around the dogs tummy, so it should be comfortable, especially if dogs that have thick coats in the winter, as they do in CO., and loose it in the Summer...I'm sure 'Lucy' the dog will be safe now when they take her in their boat ... even has a 'handle' at the top to grab if she somehow gets 'overboard' ..."
1,Good for a short time,"I loved this item for about 2 weeks and then it fell apart. The material ripped near the neck and exposed the inner foam. I may have gotten a defective vest,so I want to try another one. My dog could swim for hours with this on. I would like to exchange it for another, but because it was sold by Amazon it's doubtful it will be a simple exchange according to their policy. We shall see....I had to return to add this comment. In less than 12 hours after I posted the above comment I had a response, a new ""jacket"" in the mail and a return label. Wow...unbelievable service! Thank you!!!"
1,"Poor Quality, Cheaply Constructed","I ordered this based on the good reviews online but was almost instantly disappointed. My dog only wore this twice (one time in the water, one time just hanging out on the boat) before it fell apart. My dog was well within the weight and size limits for this, so there is no reason the fabric should have ripped at the seams, exposing the foam underneath after only 2 times of being worn. The vest is filled with cheap memory foam inserts about a half-inch think and did not keep my dog afloat- fortunately he is a good swimmer because this vest didn't do much. It was also very difficult to use the handle to pick up the dog from the water to get him back on the boat because there is so little support underneath and the straps appear to cut into the dogs stomach. In addition, the clip for the dogs' leash broke the first time I hooked a leash to it. I returned this for a refund after only 2 days."
4,it gives my dog a boost,"My dog enjoys to swim but this jacket makes me feel secure that he wont get tired too quick. I would like a little extra buoyancy to keep his head a little higher, but I love the buckle straps on the jacket."
1,Quality Poor,"The 1st time we used this to lift our dog the handle broke right off. The handle needs to be fastened on better, not just sewn into the jacket."
2,Not good for active dog,I purchased this vest for my 75 pound lab. it fits fine and floats. that's about it. The durability of this item is sub sub par. He got 2 uses out of it for a total of about 4 hours before it basically fell apart. I would recommend if you have an active dog that swims and plays spend the extra money and get something way more durable.
3,dog jacket,"worked well, made the dog visable and float able ( did not test the float part too cold). We left it on the dog most of the 5 day canoe trip. One seam the stitches let loose. Need to repair, not a big deal but it should be made better"
3,Good for the dog.,"Without knowing how my dog feels, it seems to do the job. Easy to pick him up when he has it on but always gives a funny look when you do (hey put me down man)."
3,not the best design,"I bought this for a large West Highland Terrier (not obese). The straps that go under his belly are not adjustable by position, and the rear ones cuts the poor dog across his privates. This would probably not be a problem if He were a she. However, after a few times in the water with him, he did relax and the life jacket did its' job of making him able to swim and not sink. He has never been able to float. This size was correct for him as far as length and diameter, and I do feel a smaller size would not work. Seems fairly well made, but won't know how it holds up until next summer. Bought it mainly for emergency wear when he is in the canoe with us. I was unable to look at other life jackets at various pet stores this year as everywhere I went they were out of them, so I will use this until I find a better fit."
2,Amusing Republicanisms,"As a life-long liberal Democrat, I purchased this book in order to have a good laugh at the conservative Republicans beliefs. Unfortunately, some of the outrageous beliefs and actions of the current Bush Administration are not really that funny.However, some of the submissions to the book are very telling and for anyone who is not happy with the events in Washington, this short book (it really is only a dictionary!) will validate the concerns felt by many Americans today."
2,Not enough help and too many catch phrases,"I bought this book looking for help bringing out my creativity but it mostly was distracting and impossible to sit down and read for the multitude of font changes, quotes, catch phrases thrown in among the actual useful information. I wasn't able to get through it because of all of the ""tips"" that make it into more of a daily quote type of book rather than something you can sit down and read. If you removed all of the saying and anecdotes the book would end up about 40 pages."
4,One Of Those Classics,"This is one of those movies I watched a milloin times when I was younger. It's an adventure about a family who's ship sinks in a storm. The take refuge on a near by island. On the island they encounter many problems, as they try to survive. I think most people would enjoy this."
2,Works doesn't Work,"Simply put- Garbage.The audio quality is poor, Very muddy, no highs.The sound reminds me of someone sneaking in a hand held recorder and bootlegging the show! I have to put up the treble on my receiver three quarters and back down the bass half to get something listenable.The video is fair to close to good.Grainy, at times out of focus.The only good point is EL&P performance with the orchestra.For a DVD, it has to be one of the worst releases by a professional company.Very surprised EL&P let this get released.Do not buy .Hopefully, this disaster will be discontinued and a re release with the sound remixed correctly, the video cleaned up better."
2,Disapointed ELP Fan,"I am sad to agree with the other ELP fans. The Works Video is definitely historic, but the quality is horrible. What a shame that this historic concert was filmed so badly. In their prime, ELP prided themselves with a first class operation. Their concerts provided first rate sound and lighting. What happened with the orchestral tour? I have seen ELP countless times over the years, and I have never heard them sound so poorly. Again, what a shame!"
1,Disappointed...,"While I am an advocate of the Leap Frog line of products, this one was advertised in such a way that I believed I was getting a ""whole product."" Unbeknownst to me (1st time Dad @ 50), this was an accessory to a product that requires the initial purchase of the e-book, etc. While I have had nothing but praise for Leap Frog products and will probably seek out the components to use it, it was disappointing...and a lesson learned re caveat emptor; buyer beware."
4,Avoid No SY album,"i have been a Sonic Youth fan since i was in 5th grade. they are the first band i actually liked and felt connected to. this album has a very dark undertone for sy. when i think of some of the songs i think of a field in the dark illuminated only by a fire revealing a corpse on a tree to the left. that went to far but with songs like ""Waist' and ""Skink"" see what i mean. sy has made a career out of making sonic landscapes with their sprawling feedback and lyrics. they are oft. negatively critisized and they do not deserve that. all of their albums are steller. this is not for a beginer sy fan. the casual sy fan should start at ""Sister"""
3,OK,"OKThis album was a definitely a step down from their previous work. It has its moments though. I've noticed the bass is more up front in the mix on this one, which is a plus."
5,THE BEST OF SONIC YOUTH,"not only are there my all time fav. songs like [bull in the heather],[sweet shine],[winner's blue'] but this album is somehow different from the previous ones like [sister],[goo],more melody based.their new stuff[ NYC GHOST & FLOWERS]can never be that good. though, my top fav. of sonic youth is [diamond sea],which is perfect."
2,"Trash the no star, save the experiment","2 1/2It was nice to see SY expanded their limitedly frenzied vocabulary a little further with some experimenting, but the sum still equals a mighty uneven album with very few songs that will end up standing the test of time."
3,BOUGHT IT USED,It was not transmitting when i received it. it only cost $18.00 so i opened it and found a bad solder joint. resolder it and now it works/ probably happend while in transit. I also bought the complete set new and i just wanted another remote for the other side of my shop. whole system works killer now.
3,Glitch!,"It is a fun game, but...no multiplayer, very hard and most of all, if you get to the marketplace, go to the bullies in the back in the alleyway and with only 1 beyblade. If you lose, the take your beyblade, and you'll have no blades! now, talk to someone, thier message won;t appear and you can't battle or shop! Eventually you will get a game freeze. turn off your game and everything is o.k. This happens on my copy. I don't know about others. overall, fun game but too hard! :3"
2,Not the best Kindle edition,"There are better Kindle editions out there. This one does have linked TOC but it is layed out weirdly. For one thing, it doesn't link back to the TOC from inside the book. For another, there is one main TOC with just the chapter headings and each chapter has its own more detailed TOC. Not very useful. The words wrap nicely but would benefit from better spacing and bullet points around examples. Not bad but there are better editions."
1,Not the book you're looking for,"This is the original, out-of-copyright ""Elements of Style,"" not the updated version by Strunk and White. Very disappointed with this purchase."
2,The print leaves much to be desired.,"The book is great, I mean it's a classic but this version looks like it came right off the photo copier of the original print for 100 years ago. It's horribly fussy and the copy spacing is poor. I suggest finding a version by a different publisher."
2,Don't be fooled!,"This edition of the Elements of Style does NOT include the material by E.B. White! For some incomprehensible reason, the publishers have stripped all of White's excellent observations, tips, and essay material out of the book.I grew up with Strunk & White. I used it as a college teacher and tutor. I used it for decades as a professional writer. When my copy was destroyed in a fire, I sought to replace it and was entirely too careless: I simply looked for the same title (""The Elements of Style"") and clicked to order it.I would award Strunk & White five stars. Without White's material, The Elements of Style is a two-star book. This weak-tea version of ""Elements"" is merely adequate. If you really want insight into style, purchase Stunk & WHITE. I was careless; I want to alert other purchasers before they make the same error."
2,Oops! Not what I thought I was buying.,"I thought I was getting White & Strunk's Elements of Style. Since I didn't pay close enough attention to the exact words on the screen, I got a different book. Don't make the same mistake that I did. This is a scanned version of the original Strunk book (without White's contribution)."
1,So short book,It is so short book and It is not valuable. I advice other people to look over it before buying it.
3,"Good book, bad edition","This review is for the ""original edition.""I ordered this not knowing what was meant by ""original edition."" It turns out the text was greatly expanded in later editions, so this one is missing much surely useful content. The quality of the printing is also crap. What's there is very good, extremely concise (perhaps too much so) English grammar advice, but the more recent editions are a much better choice."
5,The Elements of Style,"De Rigour in Ivy League 100-level creative writing courses for decades, The Elements of Style is a classic easy to read ""How To"" guide. It remains an essential concise desktop library component for anyone who crafts corporate communiques, and will benefit fledgling creative literary geniuses, as well."
2,Get a newer edition,"The original edition is not typeset, and that makes it very distracting. You can tell which typewriter was used to do original and edited pages. The letters wave up and down, for instance, 'c's are low, and 'u's are high on some pages.I highly recommend getting a typeset edition, if one is available."
3,Still the best writing guide,"To the many endorsements of The Elements of Style over the years, I can add my unreserved approval as its being the most helpful book for anyone who needs advice on punctuation and/or style. It is blessedly short and to the point; students will read it as opposed to the long textbooks familiar to teachers of college writing. The book has been around a long time, but perhaps that recommends it rather than encourages suspicion. I discovered this book as an undergraduate and have used it throughout my university teaching career."
5,the original grammar reference,The original Elements of Style is a must have for any creative writer or student.
3,Basicly interesting,"It's a practical book, nothing special, but should remind you some basical lessons on written English."
5,Perfect,I got the book in only a matter of a few days and the product itself was in mint condition. Thanks!
2,Elements of Style,It was the wrong book that I purchased but the price was so inexpensive that I just kept the book.
5,More great Anna Waronker music,"The sophomore album from That Dog is a great follow-up to their self-titled release. The songs range from very pumk sounding to bittersweet, and the album as a whole is one of my personal favorites. The songs Lip Gloss and Ms. Wrong are probably the best songs on the album. This was the last quality album from That Dog before thier collapse on Retreat from the Sun, and I recommend buying this album. Also, as a side note, great artwork for the cover of the album- very sweet and insightful."
2,I must have bought a lemon,"I don't know if my problem was typical or not, but I had an Axis 9 for less than a year before the display began to glitch and the player started taking longer and longer to cue. Before long, it stopped playing altogether. Mind you, it never left the bedroom - it wasn't dropped, shipped, or otherwise mistreated. I took it for repair at a reputable shop and was told it wasn't repairable. Bam - out 400 bucks.Again- don't know if this is typical Numark quality or not, but I'm switching to Pioneer.I will say, I did enjoy it while it worked. The effects were cool, and the re-start function allowed for some unique mixing. The short lifespan turneed me off unfortunately."
5,road worthy,"i've been gigging regularly with these babies for almost 2 years without any problems. as far as layout and interface, i even prefer them to pioneer 1000's - i think the cueing is easier as well as pitch adjustment. pay no attention to these other commentators - they are clearly not pro djs. these cdjs are fantastic, although i did have some problems with one when it was new but numark replaced it no problem. great for beginners or pros."
1,Awful - Fails During DJ Gigs/Events,"I am a professional DJ - randomly during gigs/events when I am playing a song, the song will loop or repeat itself in a particular spot, without any notice and without the activation of the Loop Feature or Repeat Feature. The product is made of crappy plastic, and easily scratches. In fact, I've only had the product (I own two of them) for a few months now and there scratched on the sides, and at all the gigs I've DJ'ed with them they've encountered some issue. I am infuriated with this product, and would recommend to all that you never purchase it. Its embarrassing to be DJ'ing a set and in the middle it just stops playing, loops over and over again, or repeats the song. Do not purchase this product."
5,Great product,It is more convenient than the fold-over cover and the price is much lower. The product quality is great with five years of factory warranty. I recommend this product to any one.
3,Ok but not great,"I purchased this for my new Tundra. It installed quite easy ( I did it by myself). I was not happy because I thought it would be much heavier.( I had a Lund before on my Chevy and it was a much better product.) It fit real tight and snapped in place hard. So far its holding up well though. It looks good on my truck, I just wish it was heavier. Real good price and Amazon shipped it fast."
5,awesome!,got my controller pak today! i really like it and i am very happy that i can save my games on it now. i have only played it with one game (rayman 2 the great escape) but i'm sure that it will do just fine with my other games!!
3,Better than all the others.,"Fits nicely, a moderate amount of space. Not HUGE, but it's nice concidering it doesn't erase as easily as all the c heap imitations. I've had one for two years, and it's worked like a charm up until recently when Perfect Dark said it was damaged. Dangerous, but not NEARLY as bad as every other imitation on the market."
2,i did not order a game -i ordered a memory card,A CONTROLLER PAK IS NOT A GAME SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOUR SURVEYit works like it should = I have no complaints
5,THE GREATEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The Controller pak is a GREAT THING TO HAVE! Save your skaters in THPS, your ghosts in Mario Kart, and your hi-scores in Rush: All in all, this is a great buy! Only one problem I encountered is that most of the time you need a lot more of 'em then just one 'cause the games eat up almost all of the memory."
3,Motorola 50225 TalkAbout Remote Speaker Microphone,"It works OK, but I can't understand why it doesn't have a volume control. One of the major reason for purchasing a remote mic is to allow the radio to be placed in an unreachable location. The mic should have a volume control so that the volume can be adjusted without digging out the radio. I bought mine so that my radio could be buried in my backpack while mountain biking. After using it and cursing my inability to adjust the volume, I gave up on the remote mic and switched to a strap-mounted radio pocket."
5,Came on time......,I have a seven year old son whom i bought a multiplicaton twist for two years ago and he knows he times table from 1-13 becasue of this..........So i cant wait for him to use this one......
4,Interestingly Enlightening,"""Ducky's"" book is extremely detailed and informative about many aspects of human sexuality while remaining quite interesting and upbeat...an excellent for read for anyone over 18."
5,Refreshing & Exciting,"Ducky's book is a refreshing, exciting, humorous, non-judgemental and straight forward approach to answering sex questions people think about, talk about with friends and don't talk about...she even covers questions we never thought to ask.This book has shed light in my personal life but also helped me in counseling my patients on issues of sex and sexuality. I love that Ducky stresses clear communication with your partner, that sex is not just what happens when we are naked, but that even eye contact and cooking together leads to the bonds that help us feel safe with our sexual partner. I also love that she counsels women to loveand embrace thier body type no matter what they look like. And as an author,Chinese Medicine & Healthy Weight Management, I admire her ability to write with such clarity, organization and personality!Don't Miss This Book!"
5,DooLittle Does it Right,"Ducky DooLittle has done the world of advice books a mitzvah. ""Sex with the Lights On : 200 Illuminating Sex Questions Answered"" is compassionate, plainspoken and unabashed in its detailing pretty much every aspect of human sexuality. The conversational tenor of DooLittle's writing lends ""Sex with the Lights On"" a light and breezy tone, personal and open-minded; serious but not sterile. It's commonsensical advice dispensed from the sexually sage friend you wish you had at your disposal. And now you do."
5,Sunset Recipie Annuals,"I have purchased Sunset annual 1997, 2000,2002, 2003, 2004. They are in like new condition except for 1997 which has a cover that looks more used, but the pages are perfect. These are great to collect and certainly a better price than when they were first printed. I love having them and using them."
2,Don't Bother with this Amateur Sci Fi,"I couldn't get into this books no matter how hard I tried.I know this is an extensive series based on the main characters, but after reading all 9 volumes in the Ian Douglas Galactice Marines series this book just didn't cut it for me.If you want action science fiction and well developed characters and story lines, the Lost Fleet series by Jack Campbell is also a better choice.Save your money on this series and go elsewhere with your hard earned money"
5,MORE PLEASE,It's Honor Harrington and David Weber.What can you say that isn't pure adulation.This series is like a drug addiction. Read one and you'll read them all and want more and more and more.
3,A Marine's Review of a Marine Corps Story,"Yes, a very interesting, well researched, and fairly written account of terrible battle for Peleliu."
1,Waste of Money,"This is just plain horrible. The quality of film is like old 35mm. Its obvious that this was a conversion from video to DVD, and it seems like quality was lost in the process. The women are not that hot and it never shows the ""goods"" only [distant] shots. Unless you want to see women with 80's hair and only topless shots, don't waste your money."
3,Video quality sucks,"I was thrilled when I found out one of my favorite shows of all time was being released on DVD. However, I was less than thrilled at the video quality of this set. After watching two seasons, so far, the video quality is absolute garbage. Very snowy and pixelated. With today's technology, I can't see how this can look so bad. If they can make movies from the 80's look good in HD, there's no reason why this looks as terrible as it does. I'm very disappointed in this product and if this is the quality that Shout Factory puts out, then I will be staying away from any other products done by them."
3,"Great show, but..","Obviously it's one of the best shows ever to air on television.. but the video transfer is hideous. My god, its 2012! Was this a project performed by interns? I'm flabbergasted at the video quality...I've worked in tv for 25 years, so I know a bit about this... shame on you Shout for this awful quality..."
5,Must buy,I have been waiting for over 10 years for this series to be released on DVD.The acting and storylines are just as funny as the first time I saw them. My family and friends are sick of me talking about this show. Wait till I get hooked as well.
1,Horrible video quality!,"After the initial viewing of the first couple of episodes, I was starting to think I was duped into buying a cheap knock off copy made in Hong Kong. I cannot actually believe that such a widely known company as ""Shout"" would release such a poor video quality set of such a highly anticipated release. It truly looks like a ""Kramer"" video, where somebody video taped a movie playing at a theater.....it is truly that horrible. It is embarrassingly bad and puts ""Shout Factory"" at odds with its future productions. What a shame that they are the ones to have the rights to release this fantastic show but have let all the fans down with such a poor production quality. I almost want my money back."
2,"Love the show, hate these DVDs",I am a HUGE fan of the Larry Sanders show - I was SO excited when I found these. But they look like they're filmed on some horrible VCR in 1979 with a thunderstorm outside. AWFUL video and audio. I can't believe they even released this to be honest.
3,poor video quality,Waited for years for this to be released.I did not buy the best of set in the past because of the poor quality of the recording.Turns out the quality of these discs is awful too.The show itself is unbeatable but the visible lines sometimes take you out of the show they are so noticable.Too bad
1,"NO CAPTIONING!!!!!! [BREAKING NEWS . . .Shout updated description Dec 21,2010 -- YES on CC's!]","[Note: Shout updated the description of the product on Dec 21, 2010 -- it DOES have CC, so hey there!]Once again, SHOUT, the distributor of this series, choose not to caption this product for hearing impaired viewers. Because of that, I rate this DVD series ZERO STARS -- a totally useless product for deaf people. Thanks for nothing SHOUT!(Yes, Shout is well aware of our concerns but continue to release material sans captioning. Hopefully SUDDEN DEAFNESS occurs to one of their corporate bigwigs, so they can enjoy a taste of of their own medicine.)"
4,The Larry Sanders Show,"Larry is fantastic. If you enjoyed Larry during his regular season, you will love Larry in this DVD retrospective. Laugh a minute series."
4,glad this is on DVD!,"oh my family has always loved THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW.This is wonderful! Getting all the discs in one box. Before, I think only the first season was out. The video quality is AVERAGE which is surprising, but the sound is excellent and the laughs are as good today as more than a decade ago when these shows aired on HBO."
5,Groundbreaking!,"The influence of The Larry Sanders Show cannot be overstated. Without this program Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Office might not have existed in the form they do today. It was (I'm pretty sure) the first HBO non-standup comedy series and it pioneered the uncomfortable silence and awkward exchanges that Ricky Gervais took to the nth degree in The Office. It also created the device of celebrities playing unpleasant versions of themselves which Gervais used in Extras and Larry David uses in Curb. It's a shame that it took 12 years to finally get all of the episodes released. The stories are all immaculately written and constructed, weaving the characters personal lives and conflicts with snippets of the fictional talk show. One of the greatest TV comedies ever, ranking right up there with CYE, The Office and Fawlty Towers.BUY THIS!"
1,Extremely Stupid,"I couldn't not get past the first half of this book, not to even talk about finishing it. I have never left a review but i felt compelled to do so because this book is so stupid..it makes me want to physically do so harm, i swear. save your money and/or your time and don't read it."
4,A joy,"Sure the book is a little, or maybe more than a little, self-centered. But Schaap's story telling abilities are unsurpassed. This book is a very entertaining read."
1,One Ego In Search Of An Editor,"In the 1970's Dick Schaap was asked to write an article about the ten most over-rated people in New York City. He could have included himself and had room for, maybe, one other. His stories about interesting, accomplished people were buried in endless details about his personal life, or lost in his descriptions of his personal celebrated importance.He could use a good ghostwriter."
1,Dangerous,"Dangerous, sharp plastic edges, the hole at the front of the boot is too small even for our tiny dwarf hamsters, never placed in their cage because I was afraid they might get hurt. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great Waylon DVD,"Oh, I wish I could find more of these - I've always been a Waylon fan and have seen him in person several times - great performer and being able to see him again was great. Not enough songs on the DVD, tho - even tho 20 is quite a bit. Loved the first one with his clean cut look, but it just wasnt't the look we've all been used to.Got my husband up to even dance to ""Are you Sure Hank done it this a way"". Can't just sit and listen to the music."
5,Nashville Rebel,Waylon will always be the best in outlaw country in doing his music in his own way. Nashville Rebel is the all time greatest in hearing Waylon's great music.
5,The Nashville Rebel Lives!,"This is an awesome DVD spanning Waylon's career! Great live footage, show appearances, and even a video or two. Jessi even has a couple cameo appearances! I absolutely LOVE IT!"
1,great music,This item arrived n great condition and just in time for Christmas. This is some of the best of the Waylon Jennings.
2,Waylon Jennings Nashville Rebel,"I was disappointed with this video. Waylon Jennings is surely a major figure in real country music, but this compilation, at least for me, does not reflect his later exciting performances. And most of the cuts the video and audio were poor.Better to buy his Live From Austin concert. This I give five stars to.Tony Gaudioso"
3,"Great Barrell, horrible shroud","I have had this Barrell for about a year now, never had any problems, very accurate, consistent, great distance, however, you cannot attach anything to the horrible rail system. I just wanted to add a small flashlight, but the screw that hold it in place are about 1/4 CM long and come out all of the time. the barrell itself though makes it worth it, i don't use attachments now because they wont hold, so the rail system looks nice at least"
2,Useful but not great.,"This film should be on every global warming/climate change list. However, the film moves somewhat slowly, and moves from topic to topic in a seemingly disconnected manner. A better development of its various topics would have improved the film."
2,"Loved the idea, but price and quality all wet","I should start by saying that my daughter and niece love playing with this makeup set, and both were thrilled when it came out of the box. That said, they also love playing with my makeup...Also, neither of the girls had any allergic reactions or problems with the product (I do all the applying with cotton swabs to prevent cross-contamination.)However, three of the ""lipsticks"" were broken upon receipt, all of the little tubes are nigh impossible to remove from the package/kit, which is strange because the plastic is so flimsy. I do have concerns about hte actual contents of the makeup as well...one of those lead tests came up negative though.Overall, the product quality was pretty shoddy. But, then, the girls still loved it."
5,The Arabs,"At last, there is a fair and unbiased vision for the arab people. The west used to look for arabs , as hostile and antiwest minds.In this book, lamb put the evidences that show the real image.David lamb wrote a very nice desciption for the arab identity.In his analysis , he depended upon many trusted referances as well as living among arab community for long time.I liked his historical analysis for terrorism and history of aggressive movments in the middle east.He demonstrated that it is quite unfair vision of the west to arab people.I invite every European and American to read this unbiased analysis that may explain why the world suffer from instability now."
4,ARABS,"Arabs is not as good as Aficans,also by David Lamb. Of course it was writter initially in 1984 and updated in 2002, but it's outdated for current events. It is an excellent resource, however."
1,Collins Gem Greek Dictionary,"I'd like to review the ""contents"" of this book, but I can't see them, even with a magnifying glass!The subtitle, faintly visible on the picture of the book, but not mentioned in Amazon's text, is, ""The best-selling Greek ***mini*** dictionary"" (asterisks added). ""(M)ini,"" in this instance, is a misnomer. Micro-mini would be more apt.Amazon does list the dimensions of this book, but how many of us actually read that information while deciding if a book interests us? Like me, I'm sure you check the price, readers' reviews, availability and whether it's hardcover or paperback.Even though I'm not able to read this educational book, I have learned one thing: Never again will I shop at Amazon.com without searching for the dimensions of its books, first.(I've given this book one star, only because Amazon will not accept this review with none.)"
2,Dragonology Game Review,"Not a great game, a lot of rules and a bit tedious. Played it once and haven't played it again in a month, will probably collect dust then go to a garage sale."
2,Not worth your time or money,AS a practicing reading specialist I find this text lacking. If you really want to be an effective literacy leader I recommend Michael Pressley's Balanced Instruction that Works.
5,REAL COOL TUNES....,"Man has it been a long time since the original one was released.I had the album back in 86 and loved it.Fast music think Motorhead (vocals) punk rock of sorts(music).I finally wore out the cassette I had picked upfrom a friend in the early 90s.So it was just a matter of time before itwas out on cd.Still took at least 10 years.Songs like ALL OVER YOU arejust raunchy humor.Crazy Motorcycle was on a Music For Nations complilation record I had.That how I got into this band.If you dont likeMotorhead you wont like this one.Nothing serious,just good fun and humor...UP THE IRONS......"
4,YES!!!,"This is a great ""best of"" album, and fits right in with any good Christian Contemporary music. If you like slow music, you shouldn't pass by this awesome album.I bought Short Term Memories 3 months ago and I love it.I've been listening to a lot harder stuff recently like Switchfoot, Newsboys and Audio Adrenaline, but I'd heard ""Cartoons"" on the radio and I thought ""maybe this'll be fun"".It has a lot less crazy songs than I expected, so if you like Audio A or Newsboys you might wanna start with Cartoons and then listen to the slower stuff.I don't usually like slow Christian music but I make an exception for this album."
5,Memories and More,"I had heard many of the songs on this CD prior to purchase but I find Chris to be an excellent singer/writer and figured I wouldn't be disappointed with songs I'd never heard before. I enjoy the CD very much and it has received much play in our kitchen while preparing meals and cleaning up. His words are so often springboards to other thoughts and ideas.This was the first Chris Rice CD I've purchased, there will be more in my future."
4,Cute Pumpkin,"This was a very cute outfit and fit my ~3.5 month-old daughter very well. It seemed comfortable overall and well-made. We will save it for a future baby (either ours or a friend's). A couple of minor issues: the hood part fastens with Velcro under the chin. This was problematic for my daughter since her under-the-chin area is not very big. The hat kept riding up and she ended up mouthing the chin section. She didn't really mind but it was not easy to keep in place. It would've been easier to have a hat that just fit on top of her head rather than a hood-like piece. Also, in order for this to be a pumpkin-shaped suit, it's very padded and puffy. I think my girl would've been way too warm if I had left her in it for more than 10 minutes at a time. It would've been great if we had taken her outside but she's still too young to trick-or-treat."
4,Black Life UK-Style,"Heavy attracted to a classmate Steve, Christian had been placed in a modern UK madhouse after killing a Steve's girlfriend in a school toilet.In a couple of years, a female journalist's visit triggered a tragedian line of psycho-murders to fulfil Blake's desire to commit suicide before Steve's eyes.I would not be interested in this British film if I knew a plot in advance, also performance is really nice."
1,Not so hot....,"This dvd contains 2 old Gamera movies that have been issued and reissued a dozen times, this is just 1 more with few surprises. Save your money."
3,Gamera vs Gyaos is awesome! Gamera vs Viras ehhh not so much,Gamera vs Gyaos i would say is my 3rd favorite movie thus far. It really focused on the monsters and Gamera and Gyaos really fought it out. Gamera vs Viras though i thought wasn't that great. Now don't get me wrong Gamera is awesome but Viras was kinda of a trash monster. I didn't like it to much. But its still a good buy two Gamera movies for the price of one! You got my vote
2,not much help,"the reading comprehension section is OK, but the logic games section is no help at all. the book includes all these old styles of puzzles that the LSAT no longer uses, which is a waste of time, and only gives minimal advice on how to tackle the problems (write down all the information, make a chart-- um, duh). the sample tests at the end of the book even use the same problems as the example problems you studied with, so it's hard to know if you're improving because you actually learned something or you just remember that particular problem from the chapter. irritating."
1,The title of this CD should've been DOPE BOY GARBAGE,"Ok, 1st of all if you wanna be a rapper, DO NOT SIGN W/ BAD BOY. Ever since the late great KING OF NY ""NOTORIOUS B.I.G. passed away, Puffy has been trying to make as much money of BIG as possible & exploit the dirty south by starting up Bad Boy South, & giving us such garbage as New Jock City. Anyone that knows anything about real hip hop should stay away from this crap."
4,"""New Joc City"" leaves me wanting more!","I usually don't pay attention to the reviews, but I was so surprised to see people diss Yung Joc. I'm not exactly a ""rap"" type of person and I thought this album was hot. Yung Joc has very promising tracks on this album. My favorites are:1.Intro2.It's Going Down4.Do Ya Bad7.Dopeboy Magic8.Patrone11.Chopper Drummin'12.I Know You See It15.Knock It OutFire verses like on ""Dopeboy Magic"" show other rappers should watch out for Yung Joc in the future. I thought this album was well worth my money. There are certain weak songs on the album and another weak point is the interludes. They are a little too long and boring. Although some give it 1 star, I have to give it 4 and a half because Yung Joc gave my favorite rapper, Kanye West, a run for his money!"
1,"New Joc City, is going nowhere.","It's hard to believe that diddy that gave us 8 Ball & MJG, Notorious B.I.G. is giving us this garbage from the south, I Thought everything about this album was awful, young joc is embarrassing to look at, the lyrics are really bad, the beats are stupid, the title is horrible, even the cover is really bad.This is one very Unbelieveably bad album.If you want a real bad boy south album, wait for 8 Ball & MJG.This is One of the worst albums of the year."
2,Hot production DOES NOT always translate into a hot album,"This album fits that description stated in my title. Much like the Jeezy album, the production is crazy but it is killed by this guy's lyrical ability. He's awful on the mic and sometimes you gotta wonder how artists like Yung Joc get deals. Bad album, wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,DO NOT BUY,This may be one of the worst releases of 06. Do not go out and buy this cd. He is a Young Jeezy wannabe. Just another one-hit wonder rapper. Boycott this cd so we can get talentless rappers of the shelves and prevent them from making money.
1,ARE YOU SERIOUS?,"This rapper is a disgrace to the whole dirty south... I cant believe anyone with half of a brain would listen to this BS. and then there are some of you out there that not only listen to it, but enjoy it. It is beyond me. I dont see what the obsession with these commercial rappers is."
1,dirty joc strap,"Ok i saw this persons video for his first single and not only did it make me throw up but it also made my poor dog throw up. Joc strap should be ashamed of himself for making a dog throw up. This is poor, commercial, unlyrical garbage. Bad boy has been a weak label for years and they keep the trend going with this clown. As a side note Why is it every artist that comes out now either starts there name with ""young"" or ""Lil""? Things that make you go Hmmmmmmmmm. LOL!"
4,Bad Boy South's Best... So Far,"I would have to say that this is Diddy's best attempt of hitting the SOUTHERN market minus Ball & G. Most of the album is decent as a whole but lacks in a couple of tracks here and there. Nitty is a refreshing producer suppling the market with the ""next"" hottest beats around. Pretty good for a freshman album. Holla when it's gangsta. Peace"
2,Next................,"Heard this from one of boys today and I agree with reviewer ""musicfan"" this is one very Unbelieveably bad album.If you want a real bad boy south album, wait for 8 Ball & MJG.This is One of the worst albums of the year. Please Man."
1,typical tripe from wannabe rap star,"This is precisely the kind of mindless drivel that passes for music in today's world. Very sad commentary that anyone would give this guy a contract much less that anyone would BUY his product and promote his talentless self. If he's lucky, he won't end up like Mike Tyson. But that's another story for another day."
1,"A Riposte on the Perfect ""Soundtrack to Hell""","For many millenia now, music reviewers, industry experts and armchair critics have pondered on the ultimate question regarding the afterlife and beyond - What IS, the Soundtrack to Hell?Many people mistakenly believe that heavy metal is the Soundtrack to Hell, BUT. Heavy metal is good. The folks in heaven love it, the folks in hell love it. God loves heavy metal.So. What is the Soundtrack to Hell? God loves good hip-hop and rap. But drum machine beats? Uninspired lyrics? Simplistic verses? Billboard Top 40? Hell yeah! (Pun fully intended)You ain't got nothing on MCs like Gift of Gab or Rakim, dawg. This album is everything Satan could want, and more! A choice bet for the CD Players in Hell!............does the Devil endorse CD players?..."
1,He cant even get a whole star from me,Young Joc get two thumbs down from me. He cant rap at all. It's like they let anybody rap these days. I bet he could never when a frreestyle contest. He rap like a amateur. He need to make way for my boy Slum$. I bet he could never beat his flow. We from the dirty South. Repping New Orleans til we die.
1,are you people deaf?,"i wish i could give this cd a damn -5 stars. this child is an imitator. he sounds just like Young Jeezy. he needs to quit the act, shut up, and disappear."
1,"Stay Far, Far away from this CD",Its goin down might be the most annoying song I ever heard. This guy is worse than Dem Francise Boyz.
5,Da Best,I luv Yung Joc's new album. I can't til I get to da store so I can get my copy. This is gonna be da hottest album of da summer.
3,yeeeeeeee duckoo,All ova da side ya feel me word jack ya mamma on dis jibb-litt cuz crum smackawang doodle aint got smack jabalee on ya bum-diddle nome sayn? Word.

Ebonicalizatiums be's de keys to our suckcess nomesaym word ya feel me an what not aight.
1,ANYONE WHO RAPS ABOUT 9/11 IS TRASH,"I love hip hop and anything that has a beat to it and I liked 'It's goin' down' when I heard it on the radio. However, I just listened to sample tracks on amazon for this cd and came across 'Dope boy magic.' When I heard him rap about 9/11 I was immediately turned off and enraged. How could he rap about something that tragic?! Does he think it boosts his image or will sell him more records?! Hopefully not! This is disgusting! I hope anyone that wants to buy this piece of crap listens to 'Dope boy magic' (and more than likely others too, but I didn't stick around to listen) before purchasing to see for themselves what a SOB this guy is."
3,Album is tight!,"Yo, I would have never even dreamed about buying his album.. I thought he was going to be a one hit artist.. no chance. He was in-concert here in FL lastnight 6/11/06 - All the songs were tight and takes a really good song for me to feel it first listen. So I cop the album I got to say he's a good rapper and he raps smoothly with the beats.. he's not an irate rapper he's smooth with it... and I am the realest hiphop fan out there! so say wha cha want!"
1,Another Wack Rapper,"My Rubbish Bin Loves Yung Jocs Album Cant Wait till the next One comes out because it will be in there as well.Support Real Hip Hop Not WACK RAPPERS like yung joc, Jim Jones, paul wall, mike jones, tony yayo, lil romeo, bow wow etc you get the point.Dont be fooled these guys aint rap stars they are pop stars"
1,Wack Album Even More Wack Rapper,What More To Say this album is rubbish. The Lead Single its going down only proves one thing and that is yung jocs career is going down. Hopefully one day these wack rappers will go away and true hip hop will come back.
4,Count Yorga Still rocks!,"Let's face it these two movies were not made to win awards. They were made to scare and have lots of fun doing it. They gave me nightmares years ago. I am older and wiser now. I still had to turn the light on and look around the bed. I really enjoyed watching them again. My family once again not as amused as I was. However these movies brought back vivid memories of the early seventies and what a great time that was. As with alot of the older movies the moviegoer was left to use their imagination. Especially with scantilly clad women running around. Those were some hot looking vampire babes. Makes you almost want to get bit in the neck. With the new vampire genre, I find myself addicted to Count Yorga, Blacula, and those movie heros or villians that graced the big screen in my youth. I cant wait to watch these movies again and especially play them during a Halloween movie extravaganza."
3,Relive the past,"When These Movies came out they caused a great stir in the theaters and were renound for there scaring ability, to see them now is to relive the past and to see how starved of good movies we were"
2,Cropped and flawed movie,"Review of the dvd;Cropped on top and bottom from 1.33:1 to 1.77:1. However, you don't realy miss much. While it is a make or break deal with many hammer movies the end up with the nudity being cut off, this one has none and the increase in picture quality over the old 1.33:1 vhs makes up for it.Now for the movie it'self;Vincent Price hit the nail on the head when he said Robert Quary couldn't act. And Quarry's influencing the director to cut all the planned nudity turned what could have been a decent vamp flick into a tame piece of garbage, and deprived us of some decent possible video of the lovely Judy Lang (dead ringer for Lysette Anthony)Shame she did so few things."
3,Can't wait to see it again!!,"I remember back in the seventies how controversial this film was. It was what everyone talked about. I remember people saying ""Have u seen Count Yorga yet?"" So I thought I would go see it. At the time I was very into vampire movies with all the Hammer films around at the time. I remember seeing this movie at Sydneys famous State Theatre which is very gothic from its rambling marble staircases to its red velvet drapery...a perfect venue for a film about vampires. I also remember the talked about scene in the campervan and the controversial scene with the cat. This movie double is on its way to me and I cannot wait to see it as a double feature...Enjoy!!"
4,Down For The Count And Counting,"Quite simply the best Vampire movies to grace the 70's drive-in screen.Hey kids, want to see what movies your mom and dad used to neck to?Count Yorga scared me silly as a kid, that scene where the couple are in the van and the crickets outside go silent and the woman inside the van pulls back the curtain and (Argh I can't look, I have to hide my eyes) this flick really got to me.Yes kiddies, old fashioned horror that actually worked.Sadly Robert Quarry went nowhere from here apart from the awful Deathmaster that followed and even worse 80's films."
3,Greatest Hits Album of Sorts?,"I give it a five for the music, but a 2 for the concept. This is a great release for those people who are not going to take the effort to purchase all of the releases that these songs come from (although I think that you get a better experience from their music when it has not been removed from its context as a whole...i.e. the album it was released on). If you like this I suggest buying Confusion is Sex/Kill Yr. Idols + (if you can find it) their self titled e.p. If you like those, try Sonic Death Live (again, if you can find it)...that is about as intense as they get on their own."
5,this gets 5 for effort only.!!! buy it for a frend instead!!!,well how do you pick a greatest hit album from a band like sonic youth who knows who cares .i own this as part of my collection as just something to bring with me when i dont want to take any 3 or 4 cds with me on the road someplace .this compelation would probably be a good introdution but it does not have enough songs on it.what they should of done was at least made it a double disc or something.so to put it this is not a good intro to the band but for your friend who never heard the youth .let him or her borrow this because im sure all of you already have all there albums any ways!...
3,So-So Overview of SY's pre-DGC years,"This is, oddly enough, a Sonic Youth hits album. It works much better than one might expect, but there are some curious selections here that preclude a higher rating. The Daydream Nation era has Eric's Trip in place of Silver Rocket and Kissability. That's inexcusable. Then, the Sister era excludes Schizophrenia and Catholic Block. Mere grievances, perhaps, but had these changes been made, Screaming Fields would have been a much better portrait of Sonic Youth pre-Goo discography. Hardcore SY fans will already own all this material, so they can make a proper mix themselves, while newcomers to SY are advised to buy Sister and Daydream Nation instead."
4,SCREAMING FIELDS OF THE RECORDING INDUSTRY,"Collection of Sonic Youth singles between 1983 and 1988 sounds great but the songs don't stand as well alone as they do in the midst of their original albums. In fact, they leave one hungry for the wholeness of a Sonic Youth album and that seems to be the marketing strategy for ""Screaming Fields of Sonic Love"". 8 page CD booklet offers nostalgic pictures of vintage advertising posters for early ""Sonic Youth"" shows."
2,they picked the wrong songs.,"sonic youth are a great band, there is no doubt about it. and i do love most of the songs on this cd, but they don't work together. sonic youth isn't the type of band who gets a best of album. you could put them on a mix tape, but that's it. sonic youth do albums. not hits.take your money and buy a copy of the s/t ep. you could probably find it on ebay. or get a copy of ""nyc ghosts and flowers"" or maybe ""sister."""
4,Hoping this will do the trick.,"I got this for my 11 year old daughter who has trouble (still) with her multiplication facts. So far she has enjoyed listening and testing herself on the toy. It has a volume control button with 3 different levels. It also has a jack to plug in earphones. It has a lightening round where you can see how many facts you can get right in 90 seconds. It has a quiz round, a round to plug in the missing number and a section just to listen. I am hoping this will do the trick. I also bought the addition one for my 3 year old for Christmas and I am glad I did because she likes to listen to this one. The price was nice because I got both for $34.00."
4,Good learning tool,"I bought this for my second going into third grade son to help him out in math. He has shown little interest in the toy part, mostly because he connects it to school. Beware, I have caught him using it to do his homework, not it's intended purpose! I do let him use it to check his homework after he has completed it first on his own, he then thinks it is a fun toy. His math skills and grades have improved since he began to use it, and he is now figuring out how to use it to help him complete his division homework."
2,Must have gotten a faulty one...doesn't function properly,"After reading the other reviews of this product, I felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an 8 year old boy. He is learning multiplication tables now, so I figured this was a great present.Unfortunately, once the batteries were in, it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to 2 numbers, it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the 2 numbers the dials showed. We tried over and over to get it to work, but it is a DUD!I live overseas so returning it is not an option I am willing to pay the extra freight/duty for. I bought another Leap Frog product at the same time that I have not given as a present yet, I really hope it works."
2,"Looks fun, but not...","My 8 year old found it rather boring, even after I showed her the faster games. She only used it three times, and it sits in the closet. She loves all the other LeapFrog, but found this drab. I would get one of the others with more than just multiplication."
1,Won't work!,This learning tool does not let my son change to another fact family: Only the 8s multiplication dial works! I paid too much $ for a product that does not work!
1,Twist and shout Multiplication DUD!!,"I bought this toy for my son to learn his multiplication and when i received it , it did not work.So i replaced the batteries, but once i popped them in, it begain malfunctioning and i couldnt shut it off unless i popped the batteries out. I returned it for an exchange and when i received the second one..it was the same thing with that one. Both times i received DUDs...toy sounds great, if it worked properly and didnt malfunction."
5,Twist & Shout Multiplication,I purchased the Twist & Shout Multiplication for my grandaughter who is 8 years old. She has not put it down since she received it. However mine was malfunctioned and would not give multiple choices. It would only ask the question and then gave the answer. She was hesitant to give it up when I explained I needed to exchange it for another. This is the only toy she has that has held her interest for long periods of time. She nows brags to friends that she knows her multiplication tables.
2,Make sure your ear can tolerate this before you buy it,"We evaluated the earbud/mic for bicyclists coordinating a tour. Ultimately we abandoned them because: 1. The earbud HURTS after wearing it for hours on end! (Plus having a sound source like that inside one's ear probably isn't great for our hearing.) 2. The open-cell foam rubber pad disintegrated -- probably due to some of the chemicals in sweat and <shudder!> ear wax. 3. The mic could not be clipped in a position that excluded road noise and included our voices -- we ran down our TalkAbout radios' batteries because wind and road noise triggered the VOX switch, also jamming our communications. 4. It wasn't the most sanitary solution going (see 2). ... For cyclists (bicycle and motorcycle), I recommend the headset/boom mic combination. It just worked much better, and the band fits over a bicycle helmet. (Motorcyclists might want to check this last statement out for themselves ... your helmets look a little bigger than ours.)"
1,Earbud Confusion,"Further to our last confused shopper, can anyone tell me which Vox earbud (single pin, no Ptt button)will work with the 5420 Talkabout? I have tried local shops, and they all appear confused as well. I may also have to phone Motorola."
3,Vox verses Ear Pain,Used this item while on a snowmabile trip. Took a while to get the ear piece adjusted so my ear didn't hurt. 10 of us started with the ear pieces but the sound of the engines would kick the vox on. That would render the radios useless. After a short while we all removed the ear piece altogether. I used it quite a lot since the trip and it works very well if you remember to make a little noise before you talk to get the vox to kick in. Product needs much improvement. But for now it is all we have.
5,Fast Paced,"I read the book in about two hours. It was very engrossing. Sheeneka told her story like no other. It was as if we were on a rode trip and she was doing the talking. If that were the case, no one would be asleep in that car! We would have all been like, no way Sheeneka!For a while I thought things were gonna get better, but then the twist near the end blew me away. Made me go.. WOW.So, I can list this book with my WOW books now and look forward to Ms. Angela's next effort."
1,o please,"weak characters. blah storyline. i read a lot, so if could've given it less than one star, trust me, i would have. it amazes me how this author gave weak reviews on stronger books, said they we all lacking in one way or another,and reviewd her own book as being much better. get real. talk about a non-writing hata. trite plot and bland characters does not a five-star review make."
5,Lookin For Love,"I enjoyed this book so much that I finished it in one sitting. I thought that the relationship between Shaneeka and Veronica had a very good relationship which helped her to come up out of her dysfunctional family setting. I was like ""Yeah"" for Sisterhood, but as I read down further, I learned that even the strongest friendships can be tried. Some make it and some don't. I fell in love with Eric, so what a shame about what happened to him. The story was great, the characters were real and the story keeps you reading and wondering what twists and turns will come up next."
4,Happily Ever After?,I enjoyed reading your book so much and found it to be most humorous and heart-felt. I found the part when Shaneeka finally got married and I thought she was on her way to a lifetime of happiness to be my favorite part of the story. I am not ashamed to admit that I cried when I read the part about Shaneek's husband and bestfriend. Thank you and I hope that this book will be a bestseller
5,Get the official one,I've learned from my mistakes. I'd always buy memory packs and rumble packs from other companies (not Nintendo) because they were inexpensive or had more features. But not anymore. The 'unofficial' ones always seem to break after a while. Get the official Nintendo Rumble Pak! I know I will!
5,WWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW,"Anybody with a nintendo get hndo needs a rou getumble pak. The Rumble Pak only works on the games designed to use, but most games will use it. The rumble pak vibrates when you get hit, or if you get shot, etc. this works great! It is a really big step into lifelike video game entertainment."
1,Not what I ordered,"I had ordered a Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak but got a ""TremblePak"" brand instead. I bought a used one that was like 5 bucks so I didn't care much. Just be careful to make sure you get exactly what you order (if you care).There was a nice hand written note in the package with the TremblePak that said, ""Thanks for your business"" which was pretty nice.I'm giving a low rating because it technically wasn't what I ordered."
4,Good product,"Good product if your favorite games support it. The PS1 rumble feature is better implemented, though."
2,Could be better,These rumble pak is kind of heavy it also can rumble so hard that it falls out of the controller it isn't bad though with the two settings low and high on low it hardly shacks on high it is anooying
1,Disfunctonally Disfunctional,"As a fan if creative movies, I was really hoping for a gem here. What I discovered was a co-dependent ""romance"" story that made me cringe and soon-enough wish it was over. I want my time back."
1,this movie doesn't load,"this is a great movie, i wish you could enjoy it. i can'yt imagine th ereson for not fixing it, these guys really aren'yt on the ball, now are they?"
4,Surprisingly delightful story of a relationship,"I don't remember what made me watch this film. It's told out of order, and I usually don't like flashbacks. It's believable, and I usually don't like stories that seem like real life. However, I really enjoyed this film. Peter & Vandy is a bit like a cross between About Last Night and Memento.Ritter and Weixler have terrific chemistry together--the scenes they're in play out very smoothly (almost predictably, but not in a bad way). It's also nice to notice little things (both verbal and physical) that connect various scenes. Kudos to continuity.Peter and Vandy is similar to About Last Night, but without so much pathos. P&V; concentrates on what brings these two people together and how they become what they are. I whole-heartedly recommend it."
2,Just okay,"It's another indie film with irritating music, characters who find dumb things to fight about, annoying film editing, and a New York setting.There's not much else to say."
5,Great Mood Music,"I am updating my LP's to CD's and have to have this series by the Mystic Moods Orchestra.They take movie themes, love songs, and popular melodies, play them in a full orchestra setting and dub in parts of a freak four hour thunderstorm over Los Angeles. Brad Miller included various sounds of trains to enhance the audio experience.Fine music, great effects with a real ""Man and a Woman"" quality.There are 17 albums listed, but the best are:One Stormy NightNight TideMore Than MusicMystic Moods of LoveEmotionsStormy WeekendHighway OneThe Storm and The Sea"
3,fabulous handbag,"I bought this purse, in black, at Macy's last year. I had been looking for it in white (as it was also sold in white)but to no avail. It was a purchase from last summer(05). As a dinosaur on the internet, I plodded along and came across it in amazon! What luck. I bought it in white, and forwarded the site to my friends. It is the best spring/summer bag ever! roomy enough for a checkbook, compact and keys. Stylish and light. I LOVE it. Wish they had them in every color. Lots of compliments on it."
4,'No Bad Tracks' Does Not a Classic Make,"Okay, so what if 'Odelay' has no bad tracks? Does that make it some kind of instant classic? No. Frankly, listening to the critics in 1996, they talked about 'Odelay' as if it was the second coming of a heavenly being. And while 'Odelay' is interesting, it still doesn't compare to anything else Beck made because Beck has shifted his attention every album... There are similarities between 'Mellow Gold' and 'Odelay' and 'Midnight Vultures' and there are similarities between 'Mutations' and 'One Foot in the Grave' as well... but not enough to outweigh the differences. To those criticizing him for 'trying to be cool' do us a favor and actually listen to the whole album a few times and then go pick up stuff from 'Stereopathetic Soulmanure' and 'Mutations' and tell me if it all sounds the same.I highly recommend 'Odelay' as an addition to any true music enthusiast's collection, and I would hope they get the rest of Beck's studio works as well..."
3,"Substance-free, and showing wear","Good for a fun listen now and again, and ""Where It's At"" is a pretty groovy little pop song. But it's hard to believe that this record is only three years old. It already sounds dated beyond belief. Brittle little toons with silly lyrics and sillier samples don't a classic make."
5,One reason I like my dorm roomate,"While I was in college at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. I heard this cd a lot from my college roomate. He introduced me to Beck. And I will never be the same after listening to Odelay which is the most unique and one of the best musical albums ever.Odelay helped break many barriers that would be repeated by Carlos Santana. Probably a few others. Beck combined a bunch of different styles on one cd that spinned in different directions. In fact so much diverse every day I would hear a different song off this album from my roomate and thought it was a different artist, but it was still Beck. Odelay is truly a unique album and it's highlights are ""Devil's Haircut"", ""Hotwax"", ""The New Pollution"", ""Derelict"", ""Jack-Ass"", ""Where It's At"", ""Sissyneck"", and ""High 5"". It's the most interesting piece of music put out and truly helped redefine what a well written musical album is. Thank you Beck. And don't forget to pick up this disc today."
5,Best CD,"I love this CD, and I always have- they're just out there to have fun, they're not trying too hard! Trying new sounds is always fun!"
5,This CD rocks!!!,"I have listened to Odelay a thousand times and I'm still not tired of it. If you like any kind of music you'll like it, because it has a little of everything."
4,4 stars for Universal Music Company (Deluxe Edition) 5 for Beck,"Just wanted to add a comment to the comments. Although it's pointed out that the Booklet is a disappointment because of the 'High School interviews', what makes it worse is it appears these are fictional or scripted. Someone trying to be funny. I could have seen some worth if they were real, but what's the point otherwise. They still might've been okay but there's like 10 of them. Maybe 2-3 could've been cute, othewise it's a complete waste of 5 pages of the booklet. Now go out and buy everything Beck ever did."
5,excelent,We recieved this CD very promptly. Love all the music on this CD! Would recomend beck to all! Every song is fun to listen to. Price is good also.
4,For Die Hard Beck Fans,"There are a few minor changes to the first disc, but the 2nd is all new material. I had most of the songs on the 2nd disc but they were not cd quality. There is a remake of ""Thunder Peel"" from Stereopathic Soulmanure originally that I'm still middle of the road about. He changes the lyrics slightly and the music is all new. I'm not too fond of the remixes, but Clock, SA-5, and Burro are all instant classics. You might be a bit disappointed with it unless you really dig beck. If you are just ok with Beck, I would just get the original 1 disc set. As the title suggests, if you are Die Hard Beck, by all means, snatch this one up."
5,"Wow - Beck's finest album, no doubt","Unbelievable. Beck just splices together apparently every genre of music that exists and goes nuts. From country (""Lord Only Knows"") to hip-hop (""High 5 (Rock The Catskills)"") to punk (""Minus""), everything here is grounded in some genre but changes the formula up a lot. Most impressive of all, though, is the fact that the songwriting doesn't suffer. Everything on the album is catchy and well-written. If any complaints can be given, it's that th Dust Brothers didn't make as good an album as ""Paul's Boutique"". But then again, picking on an album for not being as good as ""Paul's Boutique"" is like criticizing a painting for not equaling the Mona Lisa. One of the 90's most creative albums."
5,WHAT THE HELL!?!?!?,"This CD is really cool. I like everything about it. The lyrics are the most messed up things I have ever heard! (i.e: heads are hanging from the garbage man trees, mouthwash,jukebox,gasoline.)Funny as hell. I can think up my own beck song right now, Little green munchkin men sleeping in my shoe. They bit off my toes and ate my poo-poo I love the beats and also how in the middle of a song, some strange sequence will come out of nowhere. Its really um,,, diffrent."
3,Have you heard his other stuff?,"While this album has won a place in my collection, it PALES in comparison to his earlier(and little known) efforts: ""Stereopahtic Soul Manure"" and ""One Foot in the Grave"". I'd try one of those albums out before buying this one."
5,"Uneven but way better than ""Mellow Gold"" - an influential album in its day - barely a classic","Though the album is very uneven with a lot of ok songs, as a whole ""Odelay"" is a great album. There are three Lo-Fi classics here - ""Devil's Haircut"", ""Hotwax (which wasn't a hit), and ""Where It's At"". Not only does this make it accessible for non-Beck fans, but it makes the album that much more worth buying. Very creative with a lot of soul put into it. Its historical influence adds a lot of value to it and helps make it worth buying. Although ""Guero"" and ""Mutations"" are more satisfying as a whole (they contain no filler), ""Odelay"" is still a great record. Three factors give it a 5-star rating - the 3 classic songs, its creativity and its historical influence. Recommended!Highlights include:""Devil's Haircut""""Hotwax""""Lord Only Knows""""The New Pollution""""Novacane""""Where It's At""""Minus"" (to an extent)""Readymade"" (sort of)"
3,it's alright,i still love where it's at and a couple other tracks but overall this album hasn't aged well.i like his style on certain songs but the production doesn't hold up.
1,Everyone Says This Is A Classic But I Can't See Why,There seems to be a huge amount of hype about this album that I cannot understand. I have tried to listen to it 4 times now but have never got to the end. It is a mish-mash of chants and sounds with no 'real' songs. Even 'Where It's At' loses it's appeal after you've sat through the first seven songs. Maybe it couldn't live up to all of the hype but it's dreadful. Make very sure you are a Beck fan before you buy this. When I hear an album as bad as this it makes me wonder about the artist who made it. Surely they could spot it was poor after the hundreds of times they must have heard it while recording and producing it?
1,Samples Galore,"Beck samples the heck out of every imaginable music/noise source, then throws it all together into a strange mixture. He has the same approach to lyrics -- just a bunch of word collages and nonsensical snippets strung together.So does it make anything worth listening to? Not really. This stuff gets annoying fast. Strip all of the weird samples and noises out of the music, and the melodies (if you can even call them that) are extremely weak.If this guy is the next Bob Dylan, (Yeah...Right!!!), then the best I can say is that at least his voice isn't as whiny as Dylan's."
5,"IT'S A PHYCADELIC TRIP, BABY, YEAH.","ONE OF MY FAVORITES, I CAN LISTNE TO THE WHOLE CD WITHOUT SKIPPING AROUND FROM SONG TO SONG."
3,The 90's most overated album....,"After the release of Odelay, Beck was compared to everyone from Bob Dylan to David Bowie. However, even though this cd isnt bad, it definately doesnt live up the hype that surrounds it. While songs like ""devils haircut"" and ""jackass"" are good, theyre not great. Most tracks find themselves weighed under by overproduction and some sound almost amatuerish at best. Dont get me wrong, this cd isnt bad, its just not that good either. If looking for something to purchase by Beck, start with Mellow Gold and work your way from there..."
2,An over rated bomb,Just a bunch of sound collages and sampling. I found most of it unlistenable. Annoying.
5,Its Fucken Awersome,I think this album is great I'm happy to see that there is still a place for creative music in this age of shity one album boy or girl pop groups they give th 90's a bad name. Whenever I hear Odelay I something new out of it. This album may need a little wearing in depending on your current taste but it worth it.
5,OLE ODELAY,My first Beck and the first time I heard him period. I bought it on a suggestion from relatives I can trust. Boy I am HAPPY!! Anyone just wants a taste of Beck this album has no set style but I am always tapping my foot or humming melodies. The lyrics of Zappa and musical capabilities of Mozart. Open your imagination and enjoy.
3,mere snapshots of a great conductor,"The merits of this production are for one the quality of the footage, especially some very, very early clips from the beginning of Karajan's career, and secondly the sounds from that era provided on the accompanying bonus CD. Other than that this portrait merely scratches the surface of this enigmatic personality who dominated the classical music scene for half a century. Interviews and interview snippets with contemporaries and collaborators like Christa Ludwig, Alexis Weissenberg, Michael Glotz and Anne-Sophie Mutter are brief highlights and peeks into a a rich and sometimes controversial life. This should have been done by one of Karajan's excellent biographers like Richard Osborne. The film would have also clearly profited from a clear structure and timeline of Karajan's life - while the afficionade can place comments and footage, to the novice this film will often appear like an extended videoclip of randomly assorted scenes"
5,Must read for Christian artists,"Michael Card is well-known for his music, and as a Christian author he reaches down deep into the heart. Scribblng in the Sand will challenge artists of all types to use their gifts as worship to God. This is not a how to book. No advice on getting published or how to write better or how to paint or how to improve your talent.The middle bogged down a bit for me, but the first few chapters and the last few were excellent. Great teaching. Great reading. He includes letters written to artists from other artists. These provide very good advice and were poignant. If you are an artist of any type, get this book and keep in your library."
3,"Okay going up, tougher getting down...","The kit went up easily, shrunk well, and seemed to make a few of our draftier rooms much nicer. However, when I tried to take down the kit in the spring so that I could open up the windows, it ended up taking off a fair amount of paint due to the continued adherence of the tape on the windowsill. Since I am not a fan of having to do any repainting, I don't think that I will be using this product in the future. If the product hadn't taken off the paint, I would have probably given it 4-5 stars."
1,Waste of money,"I have to seal my windows yearly for the winter season. I decided to try out the Duck Roll-on window kit because it seemed like a nice product. Boy was I wrong. Not only did the roll of plastic come cut completely crooked, but their tape was worthless. The plastic wouldnt even stick to it. I would strongly recommend buying anything else other than this product. Unless you enjoy throwing your money in the garbage, because thats what you'll do with this product."
2,Too small,"It didn't fit across two standard windows. Maybe my windows are weird, but it was just a little too tight to make it across. I cut the sheet in half and covered each one separately...It's still cold near that window."
4,Works well for drafty fireplace,Our fireplace is very drafty and this has sealed it up very nicely. I have painted brick and the tape stuck just fine on it after applying some heat to it. Not sure if it will take up the paint or not. I decided to apply to the brick instead of the metal surround in order to seals off all cracks. While my bricks still feel cold to the touch the area around the fireplace is much warmer now than before. Application wasnt too bad. I started at the top applying heat with a hair drying making sure it was stuck before doing sides and bottom. For the sides do not peel the tape backing off all at once but do it in sections. This way the bottom of the plastic wont get accidently stuck before you get the middle done.
3,When the tape sticks it works well,"I always have trouble getting the tape to stick to my window frames. Often times it comes right off and I have to reapply. However, when everything works like it is supposed to, the plastic shrinks easily and does keep the draft out."
4,Easy to apply and serves its intended purpose,"It was much easier to install than I imagined. The instructions are concise and easy to follow. Also, the drafts in my small bathroom have been eliminated and the temperature is now the same as the rest of the place."
4,What the Dickens!?!?,"In this book, a group of fictional detectives (mostly famous, but with a few obscure ones) are assembled in Rome to solve ""The Mystery of Edwin Dood"". ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood"" was Charles Dickens' last book, which he died before completing. This book reprints ""Drood"" in it's unfinished entirety, interupted periodically by the detectives discussing the ""case"". I found the book (both ""Drood"" and the new bits with Sherlock Holmes and company) to be quite entertaining. Does the book provide a ""definitive"" sollution to ""The Mystery of Edwin Drood""? No, but it's an imaginative sollution that is plausible. Dickens fans should enjoy this book."
4,"Zamfir's theme for ""Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe""","If you saw and loved the movie ""Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe"" you probably remember Zamfir's Pan flute theme that was played all through the movie. It's the first track on this album. Put it in your MP3 player and see who you know who remembers this film."
3,Good so far!!!,"I am beginning to read Act 3. The Acts ahead are creating suspense for me; I just want to finish the book. Well, so far the book has been good. I feel that this is a good play to watch because then you can get the over all effect on the annoying character, Nora. Hopefully, the end of the book will have an exciting out come."
2,I think she was in a confortable situation...,"When I finished reading A DOOL'S HOUSE, I concluded that the character of Nora is really immature and very weak. She never stopped to think about the consequences of her actions. As for finishing her marriage, that's fine! If she needed to do this in order to find herself... but she shouldn't leave her children to be brought up by her nanny, because she lived the same situation herself and I guess she didn't like it. I think when you have children you can't think just about yourself all the time. You have duties! On the subject of being treated like a doll,I think she was in a confortable situation and she wasn't really interested in changing it. Because if she wasn't happy with so many things that were happening in her marriage she should try talking to her husband and not wait until her husband said or did something about it. If it's hard to deal with something, I think you should say it and and not hide your opinions."
4,A Wonderful Play,"I throughly enjoyed A Doll's House because the play identified troubling social issues in our society and at the same time the characters and plot are wonderfully written. I can imagine the shock I would have recieved if I saw this play in the late 1800's because its attacks the childlike disposition of the housewife during that era. The fact that it still can evoke a surprise today means this piece of literature is worth the read. Also, the writing style of ""Ibsenism"" became important for it came up in later works I read as well. Overall, strong characters, plot, and message."
5,Really Captivating.,"I really don't read plays all too much, but this play was so captivating. I enjoyed the characters and overall message. This book is filled with themes and ideas that are before there time. Its worth buying."
4,"Difficult problems, difficult solutions","What I found most remarkable about this play is how much it resonates some 130 years after it was originally written. Nora today would not, of course, face the lies and deceit necessary to pay for her husband's health-giving trip. Still, though, how many wives today feel trapped by their roles as wives and mothers, with no real outlet to discover their true selves, their true strengths? Women may have more freedoms, but how many times, when a mother leaves her husband and children, do we assume something is wrong with her, that she is just being selfish, and not look at what her husband, and society, has done to make her feel she must take this desperate step. I wish I had read this play before I was married. My life choices may have been drastically different. (Then again, maybe not!)"
2,"A ""House"" I Couldn't Wait To Leave","I read Henrik Ibsen's ""An Enemy of the People"" in high school, and I remember liking it -- a lot. I finally got around to reading this most celebrated of plays, Ibsen's ""A Doll's House,"" and I was bored, bored, BORED.I read hundreds of plays, for pleasure -- I am not a student, I am not an English teacher, and I am not in or of the theatre -- I just started to love reading plays about a half dozen years ago, and I am trying to make up for lost time.Of the hundreds of plays I've read, this was one of the worst. I know it's considered a masterpiece by ""those in the know,"" but I'm supposed to tell what I think and share MY opinions in this review, and that's what I've just done."
2,Misleading Approach To Femminism,Absolutely no woman who is disrespectful to her husband and children deserve any kind of positive attention. Ibsen wrote about a less than perfect wife who deserved nothing else but a less than perfect life.
1,The Best Review Is Mine!!!,"i think this book sucked!!! all it is, is junk there is no point in this book and it doesnt make any sense!!! Word of advise: DONT READ IT!!!!!!!!"
4,A Student's View,"After having read the play in World Literature, I find it quite intresting. This is mainly due to the Womens Liberation view expressed by Henrik Ibsen. It was quite strong in the fact that, Nora starts of like a trained puppy dog and turns into a powerful lion. Wow....what a change. The play allows us, to see what life was like before womens liberation and compare it with life today. Have we changed? I believe so, for recent times show strong women in powerful positions."
2,"When Nora slams the door, she is just running away...","Nora---everyone praises her as this great feminist...she's immature! You don't just run away from your problems like that. She had three kids, a house, and a husband. She had responsibilites. It is her own problem if she has discovered that her marriage isn't all that- but the fact is, she created three children who deserve a mother to support them and help raise them. She feels as though she is being treated like a child- well, its not exactly an adult thing to do to abandon all of your responsibilities. If there is one thing my parents have taught me, it is ""finish something you start."" Nora Helmer sickens me and all those who glorify her irresponsible actions should take a second look at their priorities."
3,Nora's Epiphany,"In this play by Ibsen Nora loses the ability to make Torvald love her any longer. This is the epiphany. Nora is the protagonist, she is a ""doll"" living within Helmer's house. Nora is strictly to look good and to keep her husband happy. In this play beauty is the motif that is recognized throughout. To Helmer Nora is an object, a trophy. When Nora's epiphany is finally relized by the reader she is in the middle of her awakening. Here we find the climax of the play. Nora is looking for Torvald to correct her wrong doing, and in doing so Nora sees the failure of her marriage. And now knows she must leave the false society she has know for so long and start a new."
3,Be careful,"This edition of the play was apparently cut for acting purposes, something I found out only after using it to prepare for a group reading of the play aloud. It does not contain the full text of the play; nor does it have the character of the original. I wish that had been made clear before I purchased it."
3,A Doll's House,"In the book, characters are set apart with undescores, and stage directions are not in italics. The only way you can figure them out is because they are in parenthesis. Because of this, it is not an easy read."
5,A Doll's House was superb!,"A Doll's House covered not only sexist issues, but personal issues as well. Henrik Ibsen did an excellent job of showing a wife's struggle to overcome the pressures of her marriage. Also, the issues of her personal life come through. This play raises many good questions on ethics, marriage, and life. An excellent play all around."
4,Still a fave....,"I bought this cd way back in early 1995 during my high school years. I bought it because of the single ""Seether"" but it ended up being so much more than I expected. All the songs on this cd are great....my faves include Forsythia, Spiderman '79, All Hail Me, and 25. I would recommend this cd to anyone...."
4,All hail them.,"I remember when ""Veruca Salt"" came out, they had alot of hype around them. This album justified it. The success came from well crafted alt-rock songs, catchy and grungy, and great harmonizing between the two girls. Maybe not perfect, but it was a good combination. I saw them open for ""Hole"" once, and ""VS"" blew them away. The big hit here is ""Seether"", and while some tracks rock like that, others show the softer side of the band. I think every song here is good, especially ""All Hail Me"" and ""Twinstar"". I'm not sure if they're still a band, and I know they had other albums, but I suspect this will always be their best."
5,Greatest girl band ever,"I fell in love with Nina Gordon when I first heard this album. Amazing guitar riffs, dreamy vocals, hot sexy babes. Pure class act and talent. This album is a classic from beginning to end. It's a shame how underrated they are. Veruca Salt is the bomb!"
4,One of my favorite CD's that I never stop listening to.,"Veruca Salt's debut, althought the band says it's totally not them anymore, is such a great CD to listen to over and over again. From ballads like 'Wolf' and 'Celebrate you' to pop tunes like 'Number One Blind', it also has lots of distorted guitar, rock driven tunes like 'victrola', 'Seether', and 'Forsynthia'."
5,I WAS 25 IN 1994,Now Im going to be 41. I am lost between then and now. Age and years suck because when you were young...forget it I dont know AND GIVE UP. Yes this cd amazingly exists and its getting up in age. I did nothing with my life and I look at 20 year olds and Im jealous as hell. The End
3,Seether is...neither...black nor white,"I'm usually a little cautious about rock bands with female leads...basically staying away from bands such as Garbage and Killing Heidi (oh god).But this, this was different. Veruca Salt was good. I'd say it's the musical talent and the melodic vocals, as well as the chick's actual ability to rock out that saves them from being pigeon-holed in the girl-power-rock section.I loved the songs Get Back, Seether, Spiderman '79, Number One Blind and Fly. Nina and Louise make for a good listen, with their vocals not being ridiculously overpowered by the rocking.I recommend this band for chick band cynics...there's No Doubt that this band is not Garbage :)"
1,Speak Up For Middle Age American Males Everywhere,"If you want american thighs try AC DCs ""Rock Me All Night Long."" Whispy voices Of ""American Thighs"" made the lyrics unintelligable. I see why they are kindly referred to as an alternative rock band. The music seemed like a neighborhood impromptu jam session. O.K. coming from a local garage, not O.K. if you're paying $ for it."
2,Where's the fire?,"I don't make a habit of writing bad reviews, but I don't see why everyone's so praiseworthy of this effort.I love girl rock, and I bought this album after being impressed with Seether and Volcano Girls (the latter from a different record) I was discouraged when I realised almost every song on this album sounded like a 2nd rate SeetherI like the progressive slow chugging of 25, and the smouldering afore-mentioned Seether (and there are a couple more standout tracks that stick in your head) but as a whole I don't think this album stands up well at all. It lacks the fire that made Volcano Girls such a good tune, and to me the songs melt together into one slow, trudging mess of samey guitar-pop, every song with far too little to distinguish it from the one preceding.I like a challenging listen but I've heard this loads and still don't see the attraction.Too poppy to be a good indie album, not enough memorable tunes to be a good pop album; this was a big disappointment."
3,Not a good value,"It's a good product, but not for the $20 they want for it. For an earbud with that price, it should at least offer vox as well as PTT, and the earbud isn't good for outdoor use, because the earbud comes out easily. Overall, it's a device good for indoor or low activity use, but if you don't absolutely need this one, go for the other models."
4,A bright sunny day,Hockney never ceases to amaze us with his abundant energy and inventiveness. One need only look at a Hockney--always a wealth of colors and quirky gestures--to brighten any day.
5,A Must Have,"The RF Switch is a must have! If you've purchased a TV within the last 5 years, then chances are, the only connection you can make between your N64 Console and your TV is through the same plug the cable wire runs into.Those sneaky cats at Nintendo know that many of the new television sets don't have A/V jacks (those red, white, and yellow plugs in the back or front of your TV set). So what do they do? They package the console with A/V connectors, forcing us to buy the RF Adaptor.So before you buy, run to the back of you TV set. Do you see white, red, and yellow plugs? If yes, then don't worry about buying an RF Adaptor. Just a cable plug? Get that credit card out!"
1,false adverisement of the picture,"Hey my fellow gamers,Don't buy this. It only has only the small square thing. If you thought it came with that video cable it doesn't. This company robbed me of $7.70. That includes the shipping. They only refunded the item price of $1.75 and not the $5.95 shipping/handling.YOU ARE BETTER OFF BUYING THE AV VIDEO CABLE ELSE WHERE.-USAGAMER"
1,Bad Description,"this product is just a modulator, has no attachments! There is no way to hook up the connection without any of the attachments. They should put a better description on this item"
1,NOT AN RF SWITCH JUST THE MODULATOR,"This is, plain and simply, FALSE ADVERTISING. This product is NOT an RF Switch, it is an RF Modulator. This is being wrongfully advertised as the wrong product. End of story"
1,False Advertisng,"I placed an order for a part for a Nintendo64 game machine, and only recieved a section of what is illustrated in the ad.The seller is saying he was selling only the one part, and not what was illustrated on the Amazon ad. and the seller keeps saying send it back-at our expense!-and he would refund. Using the illustration is misleading and false advertising, i believe, and I am angry at the seller."
4,A sweet wrap up,"I thoroughly enjoyed this entire series. This last season was a bit disjointed, but considering all of the stories it was covering it was still very well done. The characters matured well, and while I was ready to choke a couple of them for not letting go, their situations were very realistic and touching. I think the series ended very well and on positive notes for all concerned. If you like anime that doesn't involve giant robots, large weapons, or super/psychic powers, give this one a chance. It's a look at life through the eyes of a group of art school kids and their teachers/mentors that just leaves you with a satisfied smile. But start back with Season 1 to get the whole story. You won't be sorry you did."
2,I was disappointed,"I read a semi-negative review of the record before I heard the album, but prepared myself to to disregard the negative critique. Sadly, I have to agree with the anonymous reviewer's opinion: I was let down. I will give this CD some more chances, but I'm not humming any of the songs, nothing is stuck in my head. The song where he duets with a woman (forgive me, I forget the title and collaborator) is a welcome change of pace. I enjoy Steve rocking out for the most part, which he doesn't do here. That said, ''I Ain't Ever Satisfied"" is my fave Earle tune, so I can dig the country slanted slower stuff...but this record didn't do it for me--not yet anyway."
2,just ok,"I'm willing to give this some more listens, but on first go through, I'm not particularly impressed by this CD. Some reviewers suggest that some of Earle's earlier material is better, so maybe I should check out some of that stuff. Anyway, I became aware of Steve Earle through the ""if you like ..., you'll like ... "" I just don't understand the grounds for all the rave reviews given. His songs are more interesting than the straight Nashville commercial releases, but I don't believe his material compares favorably with some others in the alt country genre. For example, I just don't feel that Earle's songs hold a candle compared to those of James McMurtry, an Austin based country-rocker. A fair bit of Mcmurtry's material rocks just as hard as Earle's, but JM's material has much greater thematic range and vividness of character and narrative. Try out James McMurtry's ""Too Long in the Wasteland"", ""Candyland"" or ""Walk Between the Raindrops""."
3,needs some work,"I give this album 3 stars, The songwriting is not bad, but the whole CD lacks direction. I think Steve tries to do too much country/rock/folk/bluegrass hopping that the whole CD becomes a muddled mess. When he doesn't have decent backup singing, his voice gets close to the notes, but never quite makes it. This is OK if you are Bob Dylan or Tom Petty, but it just doesn't work here. All in all, I give this CD 3 stars, but would not recommend buying it."
2,He's whining again,"After a true album of the year bid in THE MOUNTAIN, I was really looking forward to Steve Earle's next work. Trans. Blues heads right back to the generic, me-too, whining stuff that he did before. The lyrics are average and the music is not remarkable. I don't think it was the booze and drugs that have held him back. I think his music has held him back back."
1,The worst Earle effort by far,"I can't imagine anyone who has heard much Earle giving a high rating to this awful CD. I can only assume the high rating come from recent fans brain dead from listening to the radio. Compared to that stuff maybe it sounds good. Let me say I'm a big Steve fan and I've heard most of his albums. This sounds like bad outtakes from Revolver or Rubber Soul. Do yourself a favor and go get ""Guitar Town"" or ""The Mountain"" and hear some great Steve music. I saw him on Austin City Limits playing songs from this CD and they were just as bad live as they are here."
1,Not the same Steve Earle as Guitar Town,"I haven't bought a Steve Earle album since Guitar Town, which I purchased back around 1989. I should have listened to a few of the sample tracks before buying Transcendental Blues, because this album doesn't sound anything like what I expected. Some of the tracks still retain the unique Steve Earle country/rockabilly sound, but most of the songs remind me more of Elvis Costello than they do Steve Earle, and I'm not an Elvis Costello fan by any stretch. And on top of that, one of the tracks concludes with a profanity that will prevent me from playing this album whenever my seven-year-old is within earshot. Very disappointing."
1,earle preaches flat,there are no new themes or rhythms here. should the earth be populated with humans? overrun with humans? no
3,Genre Town,"Mr. Steve Earle again puts out a CD that jumps all over the place. If you're a fan of CD's like ""El Corazon"" or ""The Hard Way"" you'll like this one. If you prefer when he picks a specific kind of music and really digs into it (""The Mountain"" or ""Train a Comin'"") you may want to pass this one by. There's nothing really awful about it, there's just nothing really special. Nothing really grabbed me and as soon as I got used to one style of music, the next was completely different. I've been an Earle fan since I saw him open for Bob Dylan back in about '89 or so and this is the first semi-letdown he given me. Here's to hoping he concentrates on one style of music for the next album (maybe all acoustic again Steve?)."
2,time to refill the tank,"I'm a huge Steve Earle fan - of both his CDs and his concerts. But being a fan doesn't automatically make every song/CD a good one. TB has little to hold my interest. Occasional cliches are OK, but they're spread across the lyric sheet like wild fire (pun intended). And the music just lies there - bits and pieces of earlier songs pop up all over, but never establish a singular identity. ""Until the Day I Die"" shows he can still approach the good stuff. Maybe true art really does come from pain, and now that Steve's ""feeling alright"" perhaps he's lost the edge. But I doubt it. I've been with him since ""Guitar Town"" first made me an Earle addict. I prefer to think TB is just a lull. Afterall, I've got years of great music listening to thank Steve for. For now, if you're a newcomer, buy ""Essential SE,"" listen for a week, and then buy his last four CDs - and wait for his next one."
3,Steve's Latest Ramble,"This is a good record, not great...but those are the breaks when you are Steve Earle. He has become a victim of his own success. You can't just judge the records independently anymore-- you need to stack them up against what came before. You could close your eyes, reach into the record bin, and grab any other Streve Earle record and you would come away with a better one than this. (Except The Hard Way, and you can't really count Early Tacks). There are great moments here, (Another Town, I Can Wait, the title track) but also a few that don't really work (The Boy Who Never Cried and Over Yonder) I like the stylistic variety here but the bluegrass was better on The Mountain, Guitar Town was a better country album, and I Feel Alright was just plain better. I urge anyone thinking about it to go ahead and buy this record but don't start with it."
2,STEVE'S BLUES DO NOT TRANSCEND ANYTHING,"I READ SOME OF THE REVIEWS HERE BEFORE BUYING THIS RECORDING; COULDN'T WAIT. PUT IT ON IN THE CAR, AND... NOTHING. IT SOUNDS LIKE STEVE EARLE, BUT IT ISN'T. IT IS JUST VERY FLAT. THERE IS NOTHING THAT STANDS OUT, NOTHING SPECIAL ON THIS RELEASE TO BRING ME BACK, AS THERE HAVE BEEN ON HIS LAST SEVERAL RELEASES. I LISTENED TO THIS CD MANY TIMES, HOPING THAT SOMETHING WOULD GRAB MY EAR. TO MANY RABID FANS, AN ARTIST CANNOT MAKE A BAD RECORDING, BUT IN MR. EARLE'S CASE, THIS IS ONE. THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING, STEVE'S ECLECTIC VISION PERHAPS."
4,Better than anyone else I've heard,"Yet another great effort from Steve Earle! A must buy for any fan of the ""Americana"" Genre."
3,Steve is the best...This cd isn't!,"Glad to see Steve's attracting so many new fans(it's about time!),but this really isn't a terribly impressive album. Check out Exit-O,for a truly perfect Steve Earle recording,or El Corazon or I feel Alright for excellent recent work."
4,Another great album,"All of Steve Earle's albums are excellent, especially the ones from the '90s. Transcendental Blues is no exception. This ranks right in line with Feel Alright and El Corazon, both in style and quality. It's hard to say which Earle album is best, but this is as good as any of them. Especially good are Steve's Last Ramble and Galway Girl. I think he should put out an Irish folk album in the style of these two songs and Dixieland from the Mountain. The title track, with the (ex) Marah rythym section is a new sound for him, and the song works well. Overall, a wonderful, highly recommended album."
5,Very enjoyable!,"Steve Earle has a voice that is the antedote to computer-enhanced and radio-friendly voices, and that makes his music all the better. This album is a fresh sound from what you hear in mainstream country. There's rawness of rock and roll combined with the simplicity of country and folk. Steve starts out rocking with the great first two songs, ""Transcendental Blues"" and ""Everyone's In Love With You."" The guitars are fierce. They are not indicative of the album, though - Steve decided to show off his talent with a variety of different styles, and I didn't feel like pushing the skip button once. The songs are so interesting that you won't feel awkward through the journey. His love songs use original phrasing that is very yearning. Regardless of your views on the death penalty, the last song, ""Over Yonder,"" will make you see things from the criminal's side. Just one example of the power of his songs."
3,Who'd a thunk it...!,"I'm such a Steve Earle fan that I never thought I'd be somewhat less than thrilled by this new effort. It starts out great (Transendental Blues)...I think..ooh, yeah! But then somehow, it just keeps going on and on...the same sound over and over. I agree with the opinion of reviewer Jeffery Ferekas-there's a sense that I've heard this all before. The vocals are a bit strained (he sounds like Bob Dylan...which is not a bad thing, but..). I guess the most surprising thing is that I found myself wondering when it was ever going to get over. That is never the case-usually we start any Steve Earle cd back up the minute it finishes. Maybe I just have to let this one grow on me. I kinda doubt it though...I'd prefer to just stick ""The Mountain"" or ""Ain't Ever Satisfied"" in and enjoy the music from the guy who really is the best."
3,"Ok Steve, Now That You've Gotten It Out of the Way...","... let's make something that seriously rawks again. I suppose any artist can do his introspective and contemplative piece, and that is OK, but it's not what I like most about his stuff. This one is not a stinker by any means, I'm rating it 3 stars in relation to his volume of work. There's just less here that makes you want to get out of your chair and whoop it up."
2,This toy .....,"Never ever buy this toy .I am a kid that got this for christmas, I played this for two hours and got to the hardest level and was a breeze. This is the worst toy ever!"
5,What a great resource,"I have been using Get it Together since it was new, both as a middle level mathematics teacher and now in my work in professional development. The range of math strands that are addressed are wide and the choices almost limitless. Even though the book says grades 4 - 12, there are a few problems that would work with grades 2 and 3. Buy this now and put it to use as YOUR kids ""get it together"". One caviat: there are no answers in my edition (1989), something I found to be unfortunate. So, give the cards to your students, and, when they get the solutions, ask them to show you how the solution fits each clue. You will know right away if it is correct. Congratulate them on a job well done...and then RIGHT THE ANSWER DOWN!!!!"
1,Very simplistic,It looks a lot more complex & detailed in the photo than it actually is. And if you could get a closer picture of it--you'd know what I mean. Good for a kid.
3,Watch your back!,"Moonrise is a dark mystery in the old film noir sense. A little slow moving but with a surprising ending. Lovely Linda Lombard (one of the dancers)is a friend, still beautiful and living in Florida."
3,Grandma Saves Her Boy,"I just couldn't buy Dane Clark as the Virginian hillbilly. Clark was born in Brooklyn and educated at Cornell; I'd say miscast!Allyn Joslyn is convincing in a strong performance as the philosophical sheriff.Rex Ingram is solid and almost steals the film as the wise old Negro.Lloyd Bridges is excellent in a small role.However, the ending is just too lame and kills the movie for me with Grandma, played by Ethel Barrymore, convincing Clark to do the right thing. PLEASE.But, it is entertaining enough to warrant a look and the photography of John L Russell hits a home run."
4,The Force is strong with Jedi Power Battles,"JPB is THE best Star Wars game ever made. Closely resembling classics such as Streets of Rage or Fighting Force, JPB is an excellent game with great graphics and terrific sound. The control could be a bit better, though. The opening cinema is great. The choice of playable Jedi is a nice alternative to the strict character sets of TPM. Playing as Qui Gon Jinn, Obi-wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, Adi Gallia, or Plo Koon, JPB finally offers freedom in the choice of character selection. The only fault in the game is the problematic jumping. Whatever you do, don't run and jump from a small platform. However, small faults aside, Jedi Power Battles is a fantastic game. You will enjoy it. May the Force be with you. (I'm a Star Wars geek)"
5,It's the Hard that Makes it great!,"I've read so many reviews of this game that blast it for being difficult to play. I for one think that is the best feature of it! This is a game where you get a little further each time you play it. The way games are supposed to be. So maybe you can't rent it and beat it in 3 days, thats good. The difficulty of this game is what makes it well worth the price. And the two player feature, teaches you to cooperate. You can't just fly off the handle and do your own thing, you have to work with your fellow Jedi, and act as ONE unit. I STRONGLY recommend this game to anyone who wants a challenging game to play. Good Luck, and May the Force be with you..."
5,Jedi rocks!,I have played this game and despite what everyone else says I think it's great. The only problem is the movement and really long levels. The graphics are better than you think. The battle droids look very real and the people are very good considering that they did not use actors and cg over them. The action keeps you on your toes as well as being glued to the game. It is very challenging. If you compare the movie game to this game you will find that this one has much better graphics. This game is excellent and if you do not agree that is your problem. May the force be with you!
3,Jedi Power Battles.....ehhhh,"Alright. If you liked Episode I for Playstation, you'll probably enjoy this game. It pretty much just gives you more of a chance to just go around killing things with your lightsaber. Graphics are pretty decent, but the control leaves some to be desired. In fact, the control kinda stinks, to be totally honest. Playing 2 player also proves difficult due to precisely timed jumps that make it extremely hard to cordinate with another. But over all, I think its a decent game. But I would wait till the price drops a bit before buying."
5,Best Game By Lucas Arts,This is such an awsome game. The graphics are awsome and much better then Episode 1. A fast paced awsome game with all kinds of awsome moves. BUY THIS GAME!
4,"Jedi Power Battles is good, but it could've been better.","I had recently rented this game cause i am a big fan of star wars, the jedi aspect, anyways. I have played it and think the graphics are wonderful, the character likeness is above par and the sounds are great. The only thing that i didnt like was the maneuverablity of the jedi. It can get kinda confusing when your fighting battle droids and you can't move your character exactly where he/she should be for a good attack or block. I think LucasArts should have spent a little more time on programming the jedi to move a lot better. such as the Phantom Menace game, which was really good. Jedi Power Battles starts off simliar to TPM, except you can play qui-gon, mace, plo koon and adi gallia. My favorite jedi to play is Obi-Wan, cause when you make him run, he is faster than any of them. But either rent the game first or buy it, and you'll find out how good or bad the new star wars game is for yourself."
3,"For difficulty on a scale of 1 to 10, 12.","I would give this game a higher rating, but the difficulty is way too hard even on easy mode. The tusken raiders are what i'm having trouble with on Tatoine. They shoot you out of the air when you are on difficult jumps so you fall to your death. And what makes it worse is that you can't shoot there bullets back at them. Plus, some of thye bosses are way to hard to beat and sometimes it seems impossible. I can't wait to get a gameshark! The graphics could be much better. And sometimes there are holes in the system and you'll fall to your death again. So basically, the difficulty takes all the fun out of the game."
5,Star Wars:JPB rocks!!!,"I tried to find this game for a while,at a low price, and believe me when I say,""It payed off!"". ""Hard-to-find,yet well-worth the trouble"", is my description of this awesome game!!! This game is a must-have for any serious fighter sim enthuseist!"
2,5 MIN BOREDOM,"i rented this game becasue i am a big star wars fan and i have also played the many other lucus-arts games. i found out with in 5 min this game would be lame as heck the graphics ""big"" surprize were lame and the game play and story line are identical to that of ""star wars phatom menace"" excpet that you are a jedi and you have a light saber o what joy i thought instead of shooting robots i get to cut them in half!to sum it up this game was extremly boring from the start the only way i'd buy this game is if i had NOT seen the movie and had not played phantom menace"
3,Not All It Is Cracked Up To Be,This Game I would have to say is okay. I rented this game and I expected better. This game is for someone who wants a real challenge and truly be a jedi. I myself like a little more variety. If you like a game that follows the movie Star Wars Episode I then I would not waste my time on this game although it has cool graphics.
2,Disappointing,"Had read some decent previews about this game, comparing it to Gauntlet and the likes. Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. It was great to be back in the world of Star Wars, but the graphics are quite inferior to what you would expect from Lucas and even sub-par for any game with the Playstation technology. The characters abilities are very limited at best. The concept of using a light saber is very intriguing, but when it gets down to it, shooting would be a lot more fun and the light saber is very limited in what it can do. Slash, Slash, Slash. In addition, movement in general is stilted. I played this game on ""easy"" mode for about ten minutes and decided to play one of my old sword-weilding games, MediEval and had a lot more fun and enjoyed the graphics ten fold. The only reason I give this game two stars is because it carries the Star Wars name. Good luck and may the force be with you."
1,Stinks,All I can say is this game is too hard and it gets your attention because you can unlock darth maul as a playable character but dont waste over 10 dollars on this horrible game!
4,really fun old school game,"This game rocks if you're a finalfight,double dragon,starwars,streets of rage,ninja gaiden,strider,or river city ransome fan.Sure a bunch of 2d fighting fans will take a look at this and say ""Why should I waste my time with 3d"".But the fact is even though it's 3d it keeps the style of beat 'em ups.Also some people think well its really fun while it lasts but it's real short,so only good for a rental.I rented this game for 3 days and I just barely got to level 2.And when you beat it There is a hidden level secret, charecters such as darth maul,master your force moves and it's fun to play over and over.Only thing that stopped this from getting 5 was the graphics.They aren't bad but there certinally not up to today's standereds and there wasn't a gripping story.But other than that great game.I would only buy if it was five dollars ..."
4,Jedi Power Battles,"This is a great game with awesome graphics. You can be 5 cool characters, Adi Gallia, Plo Koon, Mace Windu, Obi Wan Kenobi, and Qui Gon Jin. I just love the smell of fried droids in the morning. The worst level on that game is Tationne. It is very hard too beat. All the other levels are fine. The best level is Corusant, it is so fun to kill the droids there. When you start, I reccommend you use Plo Koon because his special is very useful on bosses. I hope this review helped you."
5,Informed the making of my first feature film,"I found Mamet's book especially useful as a writer/director. Among other benefits, it will give you a renewed perspective on your script. As a writer turned director, you can get hung up on conveying story through dialogue, instead of visually--Mamet helps you break the wordy habit. Use his techniques in tightening both the dialogues and the visuals in your scenes--get this book!"
3,"Mamet understands film, but not art","Despite his numerous interesting observations about the nature of film, Mamet seems to lack a central vision of art and all that is beautiful.The contents of this short book are better suited for an essay. The majority of the material, which comes from a lecture or series of lectures at Columbia University, is the redundant reiteration of the importance of ""uninflected images"" in building a scene. Mamet rejects the desire for ""interesting"" shot composition and instead fosters an academic technique, logically and heavy-handedly including in his shots only what is necessary.In spite of its weaknesses, ""On Directing Film"" presents the worthwhile and legitimate opinions of a playwright turned filmmaker."
4,"A guide to good writing, not just film directing","Mamet is a lot of fun. Here, in Socratic dialogues with students, he shows how you tell a story: One thing leads to another thing which leads to another. Pretty soon the audience is caught up in it with you. ""We don't have to worry about making it interesting,"" Mamet says. ""We just have to get rid of the pig.""This isn't, of course, all there is to writing, or even directing. But it's an important piece and Mamet lays it out brilliantly. I'd never even thought about the craft of directing before and now I can't stop thinking about it."
5,very good,book for all whos want to be a director or screenwriter. Good talking with students. Good excercises and examples about creating a scenes. David Mamet realy know his craft.
4,Makes it's point succintly,"I'll keep it short. For one, this book is really short. I read it on the way to and from work in the same day. Secondly, Mamet says more in these hundred or so pages than most textbooks on the same subject. All that matters is that every scene serves a purpose and drives the story forward. True, there are exceptions to this rule but hearing Mamet tell it like it is with very little fat around his words is a refreshing alternative to long winded suggestions. Definitely worth a read if you are interested in directing anything at all."
3,A Particular View of Film Making,"Mamet believes the most powerful stories are told in scenes without inflection--that is, with no facial or bodily emotions shown in any acting. In this brief book, he challenges and teaches students to analyze behaviors in order to depict a scene through actions alone.To fully understand this book readers must clearly applies the meaning of `inflection' as Mamet uses the word. His concepts could improve not only movies and acting but also writing.On Directing FilmThe author has penned a valuable volume for authors interested in applying more emotional depth to their story telling."
5,Putting Up Roots,"Fantatic story. Mistery, murder combine to make a good Sc-Fi suspences. Imposible to put down. The main charaters are children. And I fine them all well done. The Autistic Dawn, has a magger part in the story, that gives it something different then any other story I'v read. Id say the book is desevers a six."
3,Ender's Game Lite.,"A surprising turn of events leaves teen-aged Josh Kerrigan twenty-seven light years from Earth on the frontier planet Solferino - with a crew of young trainees and a cruel brigadeer. But Josh's frustrated attempts to figure out Solomon Brewster's true motives are complicated by the fact that he must look after his autistic cousin Dawn and get along with the rest of the group - which includes bullies and drug-addicts.""Putting Up Roots"" is well-written, if entirely unexceptional. The characters are simple and convincingly human - even if the science lacks the ""wow-factor"" and Brewster's criminal machinations are extremely easy to figure out. The book's real merit is that it reads quickly and easily. A likely candidate for rainy-day reading, ""Putting Up Roots"" can also be categorized as a young adult novel - making it a nice, quick introduction to the genre."
4,Pell Mell - 'Interstate' (Geffen),"Believe this to be the Portland instrumental band's sixth effort - as I'm almost sure there is another band out there somewhere of the same name. Nonetheless, 'Interstate' is a good pick. Tracks that reasonably impressed me were ""Revival"", ""Anna Karina"", the stunning ""Black Top"" and ""Floating Gate"". Line-up: Greg Freeman - guitar, David Spalding - guitar & bass, Steve Fink - organ, piano & noise and Robert Breman - drums. Enjoy."
1,Nice sound ..... extremely poor quality of construction.,"I have used HK sound equipment for years. The first FL8350 I purchased was inoperable right out of the box (would not index). The replacement lasted approx. 90 days and would no longer read the discs. The third unit was inoperable right out of the box (would not index). The fourth lasted approx. 14 days then started ""skipping"" (I returned it for a refund). My fifth unit was a Denon DCM-560.....excellent player !!"
2,Has real problems with random play,"I own this model and am unhappy with it. It plays CDs, the sound is great, the remote works, etc. But it has problem rejecting good CDs. I fill the tray with 5 disks and press start. Usually while attempting to read the initial track, it gives up on 1 or 2 CDs of the 5. After it fails, the disk indicator for that position goes out, and it will not let me try to play it. If I open the tray, move the disk a little and try again, it may or may not fix the problem. The disks are all in perfect condition. The more it tries to read the lead track, the more often it fails. If you push the all disk random play, it will never be able to play all the tracks on all of the disks. By the time it gets a third of the way through, there will be only one disk that if recognizes, and will just be playing tracks at random from the remaining one."
1,Where is the other box ?????,"This stringing machine comes in two boxes.I only received a box with a stand part of the machine.Where is the box with main part inside ?I am sure it's a nice stringing machine, once I received the other box.Help !!!"
3,Warning for widescreen lovers,"Though the prices on this set are fine, you'll find that How to Stuff a Wild Bikini is in full screen format. BBB is widescreen. Not sure what happened as the package shows that both movies are widescreen. Since How to Stuff is one of the lesser entries in the beach series, I'll probably forego anger and most likely will not buy a used copy of the single edition (might be the same problem).I bought all of the main Beach Movies at once. Having grown up seeing the full screen version on TV I was looking forward to widescreen.Sorry to not give a lot of details on content. I wanted to get the widescreen info out there ASAP."
3,You get what you pay for,I got this with the foolish belief that any paint tray would do. I thought wrong. Its made of incredibly thin plastic and you better be careful not to try to hold this on the corners for fear of paint spilling out. You are better off buying buying a sturdier liner.
3,Good documentary poorly packaged,"Despite the hideous 70's era porn packaging, Blood on the Flat Track is a fun documentary about the Seattle Roller Derby scene. It is a movie about dedication, athleticism, and the inspirational can-do attitude of a group of talented hard-working women.It is unfortunate that it is being described as a ""sexy"" documentary, because selling it that way does a huge disservice to the film and to the women depicted in it.Modern roller derby is the only sport I can think of where the athletes themselves make the decisions, book and run the events, and compete in them. It is a real shame that people think the only way to market kick-ass women is by showing them flashing their panties on the box cover."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"Be prepare for extremely poor customer service. Empty promises after empty promises and they will even hang up on you- the audacity! I'm paying over $1,000 for a laptop; I'm paying these guys good money to hang up on me? It just didn't make sense.Yes, I like the ThinkPad X61, but I was sure as hell wasn't going to pay over a grand and getting hanged up by a rep."
5,MY BIG PIMPIN CHAIN,Man that pic don't even do it right. It's a lot fatter in real life than it is in the pic. And it's a good weight you can tell when you hold it it aint junk. Don't get me wrong when I can afford a gold chain I'll get me one but until then this looks and feels D**N good. I know the girls like it. Ohh and I had it like 3 mos and I just cleaned it for the first time and for some reason after it gets dirty then cleaned for the first time - it seems to look even better? There some chains on here almost as big but look at the weight. My hommie got one for like a bill and it feels so light he should a just got one out of a 25cent machine.
1,INACCURATE SERVICE,"i ordered a part that should fit in my car but what i received was a wrong part, how can i be able to use this part for my car now considering that i ordered this from outside the US, next time be accurate to the parts you are sending, i just wasted my money."
3,not quite what I was hoping for,"It is ok but not what I was hoping for. good designs, lots of flowers, but not quite what I was hoping for"
2,Highly Overrated.,I found this book extremely convoluted and that the novel needed futher editing. It seemed to me that the author set out to capitalize on trendy ideas and concepts.
2,"The Color Purple, anyone?","Well, if Puff Daddy and Will Smith can make millions and earn critical acclaim by reusing other artists' songs, then I guess writers should be able to make millions and earn critical acclaim by rewriting other writers' stories.I read this book almost a year ago and don't have it with me, so forgive me if I can't make specific references. I began CEREUS with high hopes. But something began scratching me at the back of the neck about halfway through. And then I had it! Sisters, each protective of the other. One bolder and less inclined to just accept her lot in life. Abusive, rapist father. Hmmmm... Gay and lesbian themes. Runaway sister, lost to the other. Missing, then recovered letters. !Alice Walker's THE COLOR PURPLE, anyone?CEREUS was a decent story; its descriptions were lush and lovely; and it was worth reading, but come on. Give me a break. If you can't come up with an original idea for your book, at least don't plagiarize a Pulitzer Prize-winner."
3,Strange and evocative tale,"This story unfolds in many directions and at many levels and provides a creative challenge to the reader to maintain a clear understanding of the various themes. At times a love story, and other times a exploration of sexuality and pedophilia and violence, the book revolves around the history of one woman whom many around her believe mad. The story is set on a fictional tropical island and narrated by a gay male nurse who cares for the woman as an inmate in an alms house. The woman's story unfolds as do the beautiful and powerfully scented Cereus blooms which the author skillfully blends into the evocative and sensual backdrop of the story."
4,Motivational and with Good Recommendations of What else to Read,"This book really motivated me, gave me ideas of what I need to read up on, and I am now constantly writing and reading the other recommended books."
5,AWESOME!,"ONE OF HIS BEST! The guy still has it! Nobody sings love songs like him....Wish he'd make another cd like this, that shows off his ""powerful"" voice!"
5,Hidden Kingdom,"The game itself is awesome, very unique--it arrived in mint condition, shrink wrapped and I got it in a couple of days! Very pleased. This game can be just for adventure, or you can use it as an educational and spiritual tool."
4,"Skies, by Ron Ranson","As a teacher of transparent watercolors for the past 10 years,I've found that painting skies is the first and formost lesson that a student must learn. This book is a valuable must for any new student. Ron shows all the basics needed to learn how to paint all types of dramatic skies. I still refer to this book to keep sharp! Jack..."
1,Not Ranson's best.,"While a total beginner will learn much from this book, it is not going to inspire those who have already been painting for a little while. The teaching is typical Ranson, although verging on the patronising, but the Ranson examples of skies, to my taste, are not worth emulating. Stick to running classes, Ron, and give writing a break!"
1,bad beginner's book,"ron ranson's name was known to me thanks to some of his video cassettes which are sold in belgian artshops since I already had the book where he explains how to use photographs for your paintings, skies being one of my favourite subjects - and as a beginner watercolour ""painter"" - I bought this book with much enthusiasm. And I got the ""soufflé"" effect - this book unfortunately is not at all of the same standards as the other book offers the shown paintings are flat, sad, boring, and he definitely is very patronizing - I am so sorry I bought this However I keep offering the other book (the one about photographs) to my painting friends, because here in belgium we paint a lot inside, and it is quite a useful book"
1,Are you serious? $262 now $6? Not the deal of the century.,"I thought wow! This must make an awesome present. I'm going to impress someone big time. I was thinking about an adult who's into hobbies. But, it actually looks like a $6 item. The box is about 7x5 inches. The weight is very light. The contents are cheap. I'm sure anyone would think this is a Target or Walmart item. Perhaps Revell's brand name is worth the extra $256? I am embarrassed. I'll just let my kids have them instead. Bummer. I thought I'd found a killer sale."
1,Not ankle high,"The vendor was fine, but the product was way too large in the ankle and fell down. I was hoping for an above the pants ending, but not a knee high. This sagged down to my shoes. I tried two pairs from the bag of 12. Then I washed them and tried again. Either too short or not enough elastic to stay up above the ankle."
4,Better late then never.....,"In the days that I was young en pretty I used to listen to Deep Purple, Rainbow, Queen. The more heavy kind of music so to speak.Today I still feel young but have passed the 40 a few years ago. ""New"" music came into my life, such as Pink Martini, the bluesy side of Chris Rea and this more then splendid box of Steely Dan.Unfortunately I have missed the guys at the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands. But a friend of mine did not and he was blown away by their music. A colleague of mine has recommended me this box. My last words for this review are: BUY THIS BOX PEOPLE, IT'S ""TOPPIE!"""
5,Babylon Sister - shake it!,"Steely Dan is an exceptional band that has stood the test of time very well. With the release of their first studio album in almost 20 years (2 Against Nature)I was encouraged to dig a little deeper and give a listen to some of their older gems. Well, what better place to find them than conveniently boxed in Citizen Dan? It's a fine collection of some of the best jazz/rock/pop (however you want to catergorize them)around. SD's music sounds fresh; even if was recorded 20 years ago, you'll still groove to it. This is an essential addition to any Steely Dan Fan's collection; nothing better than tossing these discs in the mix, pouring yourself a big black cow, and pressing 'shuffle'. You'll be in heaven for many, many hours."
5,Once you are there you won't ever want to leave,"I remember a time when I called myself a Steely Dan fan, having only heard their Top 40 hits. But then I got to know the real Steely Dan, having become immersed in their dark, baneful world. I invite any casual Steely Dan listener to join me."
5,The best.,"When I meet the girl I married thirty two years ago, there was a copy of Aja on her stereo. Both love affairs have never ended..."
4,Nearly a Classic,"There is a lot to recomend about this box set. The sound is great. All remastered. Most of their stuff is here. I'm dying to hear their version of ""Dallas"". It was covered by Poco. It is pictured in the enclosed booklet. But it's missing from this collection. Also missing is the intro to ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number"". Since the time this collection was put out, Becker and Fagan have done their own remastering of their recordings, so it seems that they were less than happy with these remasters. If, however, you'd like to get all of their tunes(more or less) in one fell swoop, this will do the trick."
4,Needs More Bonus Cuts,"I bought this when it first came out several years ago and still listen to it regularly. My only regret is that they didn't add more of the unreleased stuff.Anyone who's halfway talented with search engines can find MP3's of demos and work-in-progress songs such as ""Kulee Baba"", ""I Can't Write Home About You"", ""The Second Arrangement"", ""Mr. Sam"", ""I Heard The News"", ""Black Cow"", and several others. I've read that many of these were finished but didn't really ""Fit In"" with the rest of the albums whose sessions they shared. It would have also been nice to hear some alternative versions included. Or even some more demos.Ultimately, I feel sort of silly quibbling about these omissions, since the stuff that's included is among my favorite music anywhere.But it would have been nice..."
5,pure class,This album contains everything you'll ever need to know and hear about Steely Dan. These guys are nothing but PURE CLASS.
5,Just can't do without Steely Dan,"Amongst the pantheon of rock arrives Steely Dan,with wit, verve & style.The beauty and sheer funkiness of the music could trick you into overlooking the sometimes dark lyrics within.Ranks with the Beatles,The Police and Crowded House as the top four pop bands of all time, so far , although The sardonic Fagan and Becker could blend myriad styles and eras into a sound that was unique and is as new now as then."
4,Great Book!,Amazing book!! I loved it! This book goes into so much detail about everything. This can be a challenging book for some readers though. The book includes a lot of statistics and numbers.
3,TA 280 SLK Headset,This headset is far more comfortable for extended periods of use than the earbud set. The requirement to use the push-to-talk button on the radio can be awkward at times but I usually have the radio in my shirt pocket. It's easy to find the PTT button by feel when it is parked there. I would have rated it one star higher if it had a lapel push-to-talk button. Of course that feature would raise the price but it would be worth it. I find it to be a worthwhile accessory
1,Buyer Beware!,"This product was ordered from Amazon.An empty envelope was received. To be fair, it did coontain a packing slip, but the merchandise was not there!Amazon has ignored inquiries.One Star means NO STARS!Caveat emptor!"
4,Can't go wrong,"I read this book several months ago and paid the going Kindle price for it after having read a few other books by JD Rhoades. I see this one is now temporarily a free Kindle download, and I have to say you can't go wrong here, especially at this price. JD Rhoades has a clear, visual style with a wry sense of humor.This story brings the reader further into the bounty-hunting world of Jack Keller and his budding romance with his cop partner, Marie, as they hunt down a couple of crazy killers in the North Carolina back country. The pace is quick, full of action and thrills to keep you clicking through pages to the end.I enjoyed this thriller and JD Rhoades' writing style. I am eagerly awaiting his next book."
3,TOO SMALL!,"Caselogic ATB-10Black Car Trash BagI was very excited about this trash bag from reading all the positive reviews on this site. However, when it finally arrived, it was about half the size I expected! Really, a few tissues and a juice box would take up at least half of it! It's a good bag, just too small. It's probably about the capacity of the plastic trash bags they give you at the car wash. I'll use it along with my old square spring-top one on the back passenger seat, (probably on the back of the driver's seat in case anyone besides the dog ever rides back there), because it isn't worth spending the postage to return it, but as of now, I'll continue with a supermarket plastic bag hanging off the gear shift as a trash bag.I bought it for a bargain price ~ at regular price, it's too expensive."
4,Good car trash bag with a couple minor cons,"This bag is great for keeping the trash together in one spot in the car. Before I got it I would throw garbage on the backseat floor and clear out every couple weeks, which made for a cluttered gross back seat floor. This handles that pretty well. Couple cons though, it is smaller than the picture might indicate so it fills up rather quickly (make sure to check out the dimensions), and it is not always easy to empty out. The velcro does hold the bottom closed very well, just if it is really full, you might have to reach in and pull stuff out when you empty it. This is still much better than grabbing the crap off the floor, and I am very happy with the purchase."
4,I like it,"I like this trash bag it fits the bill for me pretty well. Just about the right size bag I'm not sure I would want it any bigger,I think it would get in your passengers way as they get in and out. I really like the elastic closure on the top if it does get bumped nothing spills out. Its also really easy to empty with the velcro along the bottom. I use this in my work car and I am going to purchase another for my personal car."
5,Caselogic Car Trash Bag,I love this little trash bag. It is compact enough to be out of the way and is super easy to empty. The bottom unrolls to empty and rolls back up easily.
4,Compact!,"I secure this bag around my shifter and it stays out of the way. I tried to use the velcro sticky pad and it refuses to stay stuck to my dash, but I like it better over the shifter anyways. Once trash is in it does not fall out, and emptying it is very easy."
2,This is the Tame One.,"If you're looking for the hardcore version, this one IS NOT IT. Acting is bad, couple of the women are hot if you're into the silicone. Overall, not worth more than $2, which is what I think you can find the hardcore version for."
4,Wild ARMS 2,"Okay,I bought this game,and it was really fun. If you enjoy role-playing games with a lot of complicated puzzles you should buy this. However,personally I found the difficulty with regular battles and boss fights to be easy,most normal monsters being a one hit kill. The graphics are just about the same as the origional, and the spell system is the same too. But unlike the first one,there is 6 different characters in this game,all with their unique origional powers. So check this one out! I promise it is much better than the first."
3,Pretty Lame considering the Competition,"This game, considering the competition, is not that great. First, it doesn't prove to be as fun and original as the first Wild ARMs; this is just re-hash of an uninventive battle system. What sucks is that the acutal battles are lame because you only have a few options: attack, skills, and summons(which can only be accessed by few people and can only be done with Tim in your party!). I admit, when I bought this I tought that it was great, but soon the battles got repetitive and the story got bland. I grew tired of finding new and pointless Guardians who could only be accessed with Tim. Normally I finish all of my games, but I probably won't comlpete this one. I knew I should've saved for Legend of Mana or Legend of Dragoon, but still this is okay if you have already beaten Vagrant Story or Front Mission 3. Oh well..."
2,this game was too slow,"I have the patience to spend hours making items in Star Ocean, but I don't have the patience to deal with this game. I got bored so quickly that I eventually just stopped playing and sold it back. There were no mini-games to distract you from the boring story line, and there just wasn't much to do other than go straight through. I need a little diversity in the RPGS that I play, and this one just didn't have it. I am also not a fan of games where you have to angle the screen just right to be able to trigger events or to get items. Some of the features were interesting, such as the different tools each character used, but I just couldn't stay interested in this game."
4,Not as good as the first....,"I will admit, this is a great game, but it lacks in certin areas. In WA the characters had there own history and where eventualy brought together by fate. In this game the characters are brought together by a nobleman so the can fight a terorist group known as ODESSA. The story development is also poor. This game lacks the intricit storyline of the first game. But all in all it is a pretty grate game. But I recomend the first game over this one you can purchase it on this site also"
3,this game is good,"wow..i played this game from my friend, its really neat..but that was a long time ago. i kinda forgot some of it..but i rememberd they had good graphics(i kinda forgot some of it, but i still give it a rating 6 out of 10)"
4,please help me?,i am looking for the book in good or better condition and will pay reasonable price for it.please i need it asap! please e-mail me at jaisyorkies@peoplepc.com
5,New Addition To My Favorite List!!!,"This game goes along with all the good games (including all of the Final Fantasy series)! I've never played the first one, but I hope to. This game was excellent, the plot, characters, everything. But, if you want to get all that the game has to offer, I suggest you buy the game guide first. I am a total FPG freak, I love playing them. I garuntee you'll love this game."
3,Worth seeing,"I found this film particularly interesting for a number of reasons. Firstly, the representation of Dylan Thomas' work life seems to be fairly accurate, whilst the the parts about his love life (the core of the film) seem highly fictionalised. Then there's the casting. Cillian Murphy (Irish playing English), Sienna Miller (English, to all intents, playing Irish), Kiera Knightley (English playing Welsh, beautifully), and Matthew Rhys (Welsh playing... Dylan Thomas!). Oh, and look sharp for Suggs from Madness as a nightclub crooner."
3,A decent World War II love triangle,"I'm not usually a big fan of romantic love movies, particularly love triangles, butThe Edge of Loveis worth watching. It's more subtle than most love triangles. All of the characters are fairly likable bohemians. The tension among the couples is real and not overacted.I also like the visual colors in the film a lot. Some of the shots almost look like paintings. On blu-ray, the really colors stand out.Just to note: I'm not really sure what the film has to do with World War II. The war only plays a tangential role in the movie - this is primarily a love story. It's still worth viewing, but I just wouldn't want anybody to think it's primarily a war film."
4,reaching,"this movie stretches to reach the brilliance of Dylan Thomas. it captures the essance of the time, the nuance of a rising intellectual class with newer and broader ethics. well written, beautifully filmed and subtly acted it only fails to ignite the flame of Thomas' poetry so present in his works. i did go to my bookself though and reread my favorites."
3,the movie was okay,"Being a huge fan of Keira Knightley I really thought I would like this movie. She was wonderful in ""The Duchess"" and ""Pride and Prejudice"" however, this story plot did not appeal to me."
3,well done ...,"... but i didn't enjoy it much, mostly because Thomas was apparently obnoxious. if that's the case, it's good that they portrayed him that way. i watched the film mostly to see Keira do her magic, and i wasn't disappointed. Sienna was also excellent."
3,Edge of Love,"Not a great film, but certainly ok, and worth the cost if you can find it for a decent price."
2,Somehow disappointed by the story not by the Blu-ray edition.,"I thouht I'd find the same Keira Knightlay as in Atonement which is one of my favorite movies (I had not seen Edge of Love in theater). Her character in this slow-pacing lust drama is against her image. Otherwise, Blu-ray theatrical edition perfect in terms of image (of Wales and the sea) and sound (Blitz-krieg over London)."
1,Awful movie,I love this genre of movies but this film was an absolute disappointment. It was totally shallow. Horrible...
5,Fantastic Product/Excellent Company,"The microcassettes were exactly what I was needing. They are extremely high quality and long-lasting. They were very reasonably priced. Excellent product. The company was very professional, too. They sell a very high quality product with excellent customer service."
4,mini cassettes,"I received these in perfect condition. They are used with a mini-cassette recorder. I have trouble with good sound from the cassette recorder, so I don't know if I have the correct type of cassettes or the recorder is of poor quality."
4,good little gadget,works well and sound is clear. ITs easy to accidentally switch on with result that the battery runs dead far too often but apart from that it serves the purpose well.
5,Wonderful Easter Book,"The illustrations in this cute Easter book depict a father rabbit ready to escort his daughter down the avenue (5th Avenue) in her new Easter Bonnet. Besides the darling pictures set to Irving Berlin's lovely lyrics, this book adds guitar and piano music at the end. This was especially helpful to me as I had forgotten some parts of the tune. What a great way to introduce children to a great song by a great composer. Would be a fantastic addition to an Easter basket. I would highly recommend this book."
4,Like unit doggedly well built,"I've been using for 2 weeks now for work communications, with only one problem. The coiled cord is so stiff it pull the mike off wherever I clip it. Either make cord 4-6 inches longer, or she more flexible cord."
1,Very poor sound quality.,"These microphone/speakers are JUNK! You cannot hear transmissions through these crappy speakers. The microphone doesn't work well either. DON""T BUY!!!!"
1,very dissappointed,It looked good in the box but after hooking it up to my 2-way radio i soon realized it's a joke. You can hear people through it but couldn't talk through it. I had to unplug the mic if I wanted to talk to anyone. 100% waste of $20. I would return it but my luck with getting my money back when I return something isn't good since I never do. Save your $20 and buy something else.
1,Awful sound quality,"I have an old set of Kenwood radios with external speaker mics, but they are getting old. So I bought a pair of motorola GMRS radios and these external speaker mics. I must say, they feel really well built. They are solid, with a good clip. There is just one problem. They suck. Talking and listening through these things is like talking and listening through a pillow. It was such a disappointment. I had to ask my friends to keep repeating themselves. Now I have to shop all over again. Don't get these.Oh, and I should add that it's not the radios. They sound good until you plug these mics in."
4,Very Convenient!,"Used for a long road trip with 2 Cars. The Cord lenth isn't horrible, it was ok for my use but I agree... it could be longer. Overall for the 13 bucks I paid for a used one was worth it."
4,50% failure rate,"Had a 50% failure rate. Ordered two to use on our Motorola's. One unit failed to transmit after three day's use. Would key radio, but no transmit audio. Opened up the case and reseated the plug inside and now works. These work well and are well made. Includes a rubber gasket between the front and back of the case and the PTT switch. As everyone else has said, the cable need to be at least a foot longer. I rated them a four as they do work well."
5,purchased for ski trip,"purchased these for a multi day trip to whistler with a group of 6. since we didn't feel like paying for cellphone service in Canada, this seemed like a great alternative, in conjunction with some older motorola talkabout 289s that I had laying around.These are original motorola products, and have a secure clip on the back that we found will grip to whatever we fastened it to. it's quite convenient to have just the speaker outside of a pocket, and the rest of the radio and cord inside. push-button talking, and a nice loud speaker made it great for snowboarding, especially when it was blizzard-like conditions and visibility wasn't the best."
5,Nice Accessory,"Lets you make/receive transmissions without having to pick up you radio. Very convenient. The cord could've been made to be a bit longer, but it's hardly a problem."
1,Bad Luck,Product was not shipped the first go around. My Credit card was billed. Product was not shipped the second go around. On the third go around I asked for a refund and it was granted. Purchased product locally for the same price. This is the only time I have had a problem with a product.
4,Ike B,So far it's keeping the new car cleaner than the old and that's what I care about most. I also like that it doesn't look too tacky!
5,Excellent!,"I have nothing but good things to say about this item. It came in, VERY FAST, and I immediately brought it out to my car and installed it in about 5 minutes. I have a Saturn Aura, not a very big car, and it fit perfectly. My dog loves it. He paces a lot and this is perfect so he doesn't ruin the seats in our car!"
5,Works great!,"This cover works great - setup was quick and the material seems very durable. I'd been using old sheets and towels in my backseat, this works much better. The cover is well constructed and I anticipate that it will last for years."
4,Just what I expected,This fits very well in my 2008 Subaru Outback. Easy and fast to take out and put back. I would recommend it.
5,Awesome seat cover,"I wanted a seat cover that would stay in place and keep my Lab's fur and dirt off the seats after playing in the park. This seat cover really delivers. Before I used a sheet and it always fell off of the seat back. This seat cover stays in place due to the sturdy and adjustable straps that hook onto the headrests. My favorite feature is the plastic tubes that fit into the crevice in the seat and keeps it in place. The quilted material is very sturdy and puts up with the abuse from my Lab and Doberman. The only downfall is a slight chemical smell, but it seems to be wearing off. My dogs Red and Kasey thank you for making a great product!!!!"
4,Solves a Hairy Problem,"Our new car is not what we call ""dog friendly."" Black upholstery and a yellow lab are a problematic combination, but the Solvit bench seat cover keeps us sane. We like the neutral color and durable fabric which, by the way washes nicely. Our car is a little smaller than most, but the seat cover can be adjusted to fit snugly. Now if we only had a ""Solvit"" for the kitchen floor!"
5,Parker loves the cover!,"I bought two Deluxe Bench Covers, one for my Camry and one for my Pathfinder. My five and a half month standard poodle loves to jump into the car when we go out. Both cars have leather seats. I just inserted the tube holders and the elastic bands on the sides, along with the head rest bands. It took less than five minutes. The s hook fasteners were not needed. The covers don't slide or shift. He lays down on the cover and loves the softness. Thanks for a great product."
3,Too small,"It is everything it appears to be, but do not reccomend it for fold down back area in Dodge Ram pickups (extended cab). Too small, does not attach correctly."
5,Love it,"Took a 12 hour car ride for holiday, dog was comfortable and cover protected my car seats. Fits snug in my small SUV, not quite as snug in our smaller car--but still worked. Very happy, may purchase a 2nd one so we can have one in each car."
5,Love it!,Very easy to install. Stays in place when my boxer jumps in the back seat. Keeps the seat very clean.
4,Schnauzer,"The Solvit Bench Seat For Pets is doing the job for us. It is a nice fit to our rear bench seat and attaches fairly well. Our dog is a minature schnauzer so we don't experience any movement of the cover although he is tethered while in the seat and on the cover. The durability seems very good although it hasn't been used too much as of yet. The only recommendation for the manufacture would be to offer the cover in several colors to match the interior of newer automobile i.e gray. All in all, satisfied with our purchase and the job it is doing."
4,"So far, so good!","So far, the seat cover does not move, it's protecting the back seat in my car, and does cover the entire length of the seat bench. Plus it was easy to install! We are very pleased!"
4,ShiTzu in back seat,My purchase of the Solvit bench seat cover from Amazon was delv. promptly. This item was needed when I purchased a new car with leather seats. I have two ShiTzu's The cover's quality is fine but the bench seat of the car itself (Buick Regal) does not have the correct design to attach the under seat straps. I am using it and will try to make do.
2,No good for leather seats,"I bought this to replace a 'pet robe' cover that was worn out. It is a very well made cover and fits well on the seat. The problem is that it doesn't have any rubber backing and therefore, it slides all over leather seats. No matter how secure I thought it was, as soon as my dog walked on it, it slipped and exposed the leather seats. I gave it to my sister who has cloth seats and it works great in her car."
5,I would give this 6 stars if I could!,"After throwing away several over-priced, useless seat covers, I found this one from Solvit. Fantastic! It really stays put when a large dog jumps in and out. It's easy to install and clean. I like the neutral color, too. Don't consider any other brand -- we have them in all our cars, and recommend to all our dog-owner friends."
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"For many years I've used this product with satisfaction. HOWEVER, recently the manufacturer substituted a cheap polyester fabric for the 100% heavy duty cotton twill as pictured. The result is a seatcover that slips everytime the dog moves."
3,OK...,OK for the price I guess..fits pretty well (2008 Envoy) but found it cheaper at Petsmart 2 weeks later!
3,"Love my old one, won't buy the new one.","I bought one of these 4 years ago to protect the leather on the back seat of a F-150. The fabric has worn like iron -- no evidence at all that it's seen 4 years of dog abuse and about 10 washings. The only issue is with the elastic straps that hook under the seats, which have lost their elasticity and are now essentially useless. I need another one, but I'm very disappointed to read here that they changed the fabric and the backing. What was a good product may no longer be, so I'll look at something else."
1,Not Happy,I have a lab 1 and 1/2 years old. Does not work well for us at all. She is yellow and my car seat is black cloth. What was I thinking???? This is a new car for me. My lab is too frisky and just pushes it all up. Cheap canvas car cover actually worked a little better. Sorry! wish I could say good things.
1,Doesn't stay on the seat,"For my car, the seat cover does not have adequate fasteners/straps to keep it on the seat. I had to return it."
4,very good so far...,"have had this for about a month now... it stays in place even on my leather seats, but to make it extra secure, i put a yoga mat underneth, cause when my lab jumps in the car it tends to slide and her nails clamp on seat, so the yoga mat works as a good team with this cover... i also put a beach towel on top of this cover, so i dont have to wash it very often, she comes in the car with muddy paws sometimes, this way i will prolong the cover life not washing as often, just shake the beach towel dirt off... but it could benefit from beig a tid bit bigger, like 5 inchs , it kinda doesnt cover the whole bench.. but it still good...."
3,Dog Lover,"This is the second one we have purchased. Absolutely loved the first one. This one is not made as well and the fabric is much thinner and seems that it will be far less durable. I wish they would have left the design alone, it was great before."
4,Excellent,"Works for my leather seats. Because it isn't custom I did have to make adjustments on the elastic that goes under the seat, but is great for med- large SUV's."
4,"Not perfect, but still good","It does protect the seat, and it stays in place nicely if installed right. I just wish it did a little better job protecting the headrests of the back seats as well (though it has to go around them to stay in place so I assumed this was going to be the case upon purchase). I find that I still have to cover those up in order for no dog hair mess on them. My favorite part of the cover is if you have a large dog like I do, then there are slits to get a harness buckled into the seat belts or to seat a passenger in the back with the dog and still let them wear their seat belt. I have used it to take my dog to the beach and it protected my seats from my wet dog and the sand no problem. Just pulled it out, shook it out and washed it, and didn't have to vacuum any sand out of the car! That was nice. Seems sturdy and like it's going to last, so well worth the money."
3,beautiful seat cover,"I have been using 2 beach towels for years and finally decided to upgrade. This cover was the nicest I had seen anywhere. Received quickly and love the suede-like material and way it fits over back headrests and seatbelt openings. The elastice and hooks that are to secure the seat portion do not work for me; there is no extra space between my rear seat and the floor (would work very well for SUV back seats). The reason I gave it a 3 was the material on the underside...because it is a shiny, slippery fabric, it lifts up when the dogs move around. Suggestion: the bottom would stick better to the fabric seats if the material would have been a fleece-like cotton. I have an old single front seat cover that has a towel-like fabric on the underside and it never moves around."
2,wish there were more options for better fit,"(originally happy about the quick delivery and the look of this product... material much better than prior one i bought and gave away....)that being said... i plugged in my vehicle type '08 honda element... and product was supposed to fit. well, not so much. baggy by the sides. doesn't wrap around seat.. so seat gets hairy anyway.... and last week, stopped at stop sign, not too quickly i might add... and my very beloved dog who was asleep.... fell hard onto the floor. when i looked at the cover, it was barely hanging on by headrests. broke my heart for my dog, stopped in middle of road late at night to make sure he was ok.signed, frustrated"
5,We love this seat cover!,"I have 2 white haired dogs that shed- A lot! This seat cover is wonderful. I had a cheap seat cover from ebay that ripped, didn't stay put and wasn't as nice to sit on as this one. This one may be a bit big for my 2005 Chevy Malibu, but we make it work just fine. The spacing for the head rests isn't perfect for my car, but this isn't a show stopper. The straps for the bottom don't really anchor all that great on anything either, but I have found places to anchor them and this cover has stayed put with the dogs on it in the car. We haven't done any long road trips yet, so I can't comment on long term staying in place. I also haven't washed it yet. Out of the package, there were some long threads. Mine weren't attached to anything, so they got picked off and thrown in the trash no problem."
3,okay but not great,"I have a Nissan Murano and the cover does fit, somewhat. The part that I have an issue with is the straps on the back of the seat (around the headrests). The plastic connector on one side just broke. I'm guessing it's because the dog pulls on the cover when she's on it, but that should've been figured into the equation when it was made. A stronger connector would be a good idea. Overall, it's still okay, although I now have to keep it connected with a safety pin, which pops out often. I would probably not suggest this for anyone until they make the snaps more durable. Otherwise, the look is nice."
3,Nice product tho not recommended for leather seats,I was impressed with quality of cover. Unfortunately it does NOT work well with leather seats. I am very disappointed. If there was a way to keep cover firmly attached to seat i would be so happy. I have a four door honda accord. I would highly recommend it for any seat other than leather.
3,This product is functional but not great,"First let me say that this seat cover does the job, it is not as nice as I thought it would be though. Cover looks cheap- which goes to show that you get what you pay for. The cover slips on the leather seats so it must be adjusted often. I was also disappointed in the color, it appears to be gray in the picture but it is actually closer to a brown! As I said it serves the purpose."
4,Great purchase!,"I have an airedale terrier that is really anxious/excited during car rides, so I needed something to protect my leather seats for a long car trip. I drive a Toyota Land Cruiser and it fits well (isn't too short). I was hesitant to purchase this, but have been really pleased with it! I was afraid the cover would slide around, as my dog moves A LOT, but I haven't had a problem with the seats being exposed! This has been perfect for protecting the leather from nails/dirt, but he also had an abcess that opened on the way to the vet and nothing leaked through the cover. The cover is really easy to put in/take out and really stays in place. I would recommend this to any pet owner with cloth or leather seats. Also, it's really easy to wash. I put it in the washing machine and let it air dry (don't want it rattling around in the dryer) and it's as good as new!"
4,very nice,"Bought as a gift, They just love it. To small for full size pick-up ( rear seat,nowhere to hook it to), but great for mid nice car."
5,Solvit 62283 Deluxe Bench,"The best seat cover for my dogs that I have ever bought. It's durable, attractive, easy to install and holds its form without sliding around the seat."
5,Attractive and Very Nice,"The seat cover seems well made and is very simple to install or remove. The color is a perfect addition for covering the brown leather ""King Ranch"" back seat in my F350. MAX, my Red Lab, loves it and he doesn't have to sit on the previous old packing quilt anymore................"
5,5 Stars!,"This cover does exactly what is intended to do-protect the seat, and it is easy to use! Definitely the best cover out there!"
5,GOOD QUALITY!,"Very happy with the price and quality of the cover. It's thick, soft, and seems to me that my dog loves it!"
2,Solv-It did not solve a thing,"I bought this product based on the product description and reviews. However, it showed up with parts missing, so had to be returned. Also, the color is a pretty funky military brown, not an attractive or, as advertised, neutral solution to making it work in virtually any vehicle. Why in the world wouldn't someone get the bright idea to produce this in a middle toned, neutral gray? DUH!!!But I digress . . .My solution will be to go to Home Depot and find a simple tarp for a fraction of the cost and rig it to work with a couple of bungee cords. Problem? Solved it."
5,Great product,The Solvit bench seat cover works great to protect the seat of our new Ford Escape. It stays in place well and was easy to install.
4,Doggy Blanket,"Oh, Fido took to the blanket like a duck to water. It was easily installed and has cut down on the dog hair by about 87%"
5,love the cover,"this cover is fabulous and so easy to install.fit our lexus 350 suv like a glove, installed in 2 minutes and the lab loves it much better than the leather seat as she doesn't slide on this versus leather. we just bought another for the bmw 750 and can't say enough about how pleased we are with the quality, ease of installation and price. the best cover out there is this one!"
4,good for its value,"It works better for SUV's or trucks, for small cars you have to make minor adjustments to make it tight. Apart from that it's an excellent product that my dog is not interested in chewing on."
4,Perfect for my pick up truck!,"Extremely good fit especially for a ""universal style"" seat cover. Works very will in my F150; and has great wear and tear even with my high energy pitbull."
2,durable but impossible to install,"IF you have an Audi a4 or a BMW X3 or I'd imagine any kind of car with built-in seats, this is impossible to install (to bottom part, which is the actual part that secures the blanket). Bummer, as it is quite durable and good looking."
