2,Typical Jerry Bruckenheimer over-drama,"Again, Jerry Bruckenheimer makes the believable unbelievably over-dramatized, i.e. Con Air, Armageddon, etc. Why is this guy still making movies? Too many people with little intelligence think that his movies are good. Why?"
2,"No ""Conversation""","The filmmakers were unwise to make Hackman's character so similar to his earlier role in ""The Conversation"", as that film is superior to this one in every way. This one's a poor excuse for a thriller. The script's half as clever as it wants to be, and Will Smith's one-liners don't help any. The surveillance technology throughout is more or less magic, doing impossible things with lots of gee-whiz sound effects."
4,Excellent Movie,I watched this movie years ago and loved it. Story line is excellent and the actors are great. Unfortunately it is not available on Netflix or any rental place so I ended up buying a used copy from a seller on Amazon. I would highly recommend this movie.
4,Cool Flick,"Hey, it's no Scarface, but it got my attention. Tony Scott never ceases to entertain the hell out of me with his smokey, sharply-edited, fast-paced directing. Props for whoever wrote this movie too; it's pretty impressive how he managed to tie together all of Will Smith's problems and combine them in the end for one of the loudest mexican stand-offs ever seen on film. Not bad performances, especially by Smith who I feel is totally underrated to begin with. Great buy for action fans and movie buffs alike; just heed this warning: if you're a little paranoid about certain things and take movies way too seriously, DO NOT WATCH THIS. Smith's situation is a little unlikely, but anything's possible."
5,Pure Adrenaline!,"It's a Will Smith action movie. Need I say more? Tony Scott (Crimson Tide, The Fan) brilliantly directs this adrenaline ride featuring two legendary actors: Gene Hackman and Jon Voight. The action scenes are heart-stopping. They're just awesome. This movie is highly recommended. Those high tech devices are scary!"
3,Enemy of the State,"This movie has a good plot, good actors and overall is entertaining. The only thing in the form of a critique would be that the screenplay writers seemed to want the movie to run into tomorrow. It could have ended much sooner than it did by cutting out some of the scenes that contributed little-to-nothing to the movie. Because of that, when it gets close to the end, you might either already be bored, or on the other hand, happy that the movie is ending soon.As I said, good plot, good acting, and screenwriters with an ego."
4,A DVD review,An excellent techno-action adventure film. The featurettes are just extended trailers for the most part. No really interesting material on the making of the film is given. Very basic DVD for a techno-film. Reasonable DVD to have in the collection if you like the genre.
4,Enemy of the State is an intense thriller!,"This is a smart movie that lives on the premise Big Brother is Watching Us. This movie makes a statement about our society. That is the lack of privacy we have as Americans. I would hope all movies could make some sort of statement such as that. The plot is what makes this movie a winner. Except for an unsatisfying ending, I liked this film."
5,Great Movie in the Theater! DVD quality??,I saw this Movie in the Theater - twice - and was extremely impressed. I would like to know how this movie transferred to DVD? In particular Sound and Video quality. I was under the impression this was the place to review the quality of the DVD - since this is the place to buy it. Thanks
4,Wow! What a ride!,"This movie will keep your heart pounding, Just when you're not sure what is going to happen another twist comes along. Will Smith and Gene Hackman are cast very well. Tony Scott does a wonderful job - Again."
5,Enemy of the State,"This is one of the best movies I have seen. With Will Smith being a D.C. Lawyer running into a college friend who slips him an assasination tape of a congressman made via bird watching video equiptment near a lake. The NSA is hot on Smith's trail, with John Voight leading the pack. Will Smith takes the aid of Brill, played by Gene Hackman, who was recommended by an information dealer who ran jobs for Smith for his court cases. With a great cast, non-stop action, and a couple hoots and hollars, this movie should be the example to all the directors of all government-based action movies. I thank the director on his stunning work, the writers giving a complex story, and the scoring guy, who made an outstanding soundtrack."
5,A great move.,This is a great movie. I love collecting older movies and this is one that I will watch over and over again.
2,Nothing Special,"For a suspense movie, it isn't very suspensful. Will Smith plays a poor character, with a weak supporting cast. The plot is good, but poorly executed. Maybe worth a rental, but I wouldn't buy it."
2,another one?,"This was so boring. It was the same plot that we've seen a hundred times. Guy stumbles on to something he shouldn't have, government makes his life Hell. Running, running, running. Blah Blah Blah. You've seen it before with other titles, don't bother to see it again unless you just enjoy watching Will Smith."
5,It was a great movie. It was really wild....,"It was a stirring movie. All the technology they use in the movie was out of this world. Is our government really doing this, yes I believe so. But over all it was good."
5,THE BEST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MOVIE EVER!,This movie totally kicks! An excellent high tech movie for all viewers! Watch this movie! And remember! BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING!!!
5,Enemy of the State,"This movie is a kicky, knockout thriller. A solid two hours of pure entertainment. An all star cast list including Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Jack Black, Seth Green, Jamie Kennedy, Jason Lee and many more piece together a heart stopping action packed and original four star production."
5,"If You Are Paranoid for a Good Reason, You're not Really Paranoid","Just watched this again after over six years since my last viewing. This film was a bit ahead of its time, since today our society has a plethora of the personal media and wireless devices we all use daily; today the stage is better set for the paranoid to be right once in a while inasmuch as we have so many more communication gadgets.Smith was good, the action better than average, Hackman was excellent, and the spy-van guys were fun (Green, Jack Black, Jamie Kennedy, etc., -- not approaching the X-Files' crew, but still a entertaining garland).This movie may have its flaws, but for most it is a good show with lots of thrills and it will not leave you disapointed on a Movie night."
5,Blu ray movie,I love blu rays ever since I bought and you cant get any better picture or thrill in any other system like the blu ray. I fully recommend this movie for an action thriller.
2,"An unintresting,dull look on panoima","Enemy of the State is boring, and has an uninresting story and dialoge. Some good acting by Regina King. But the plots were over to long and there was no fun just watching the film, and plus the thrills were worthless, it was like going to a store and on to home. Thats what this movie shows. And I have to admit it there was some good things I liked, like when Will Smith runs off trying to get to his home to tell his wife that someone is after him,that was a good scene. But overall the movie isn't worth seeing, but that's my opinion. C- **"
1,BIG TIME BOMB,"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THRILLER WANNA BE. IT IS SLOW, BORING AND COMPLETLY UN REALISTIC. IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT PAYING MONEY FOR THSI BIG TIME BOMB THINK AGAIN."
3,Could have been better,"Tried to like this one without getting too annoyed at the gov't agency with the giant TV screen in the main office, the nerds, the simplified version of computers (does that button clacking get on your nerves too?). Punch a couple of said buttons and a satellite can locate and watch a person running through the streets of a major city? Although that camera in the lingerie shop was a nice touch..now THAT would be more plausible. Worked for the big bad NSA in my service days, and believe me, they could never be that efficient..it's a gov't beaucracy for crying out loud. On the plus side, you can't go wrong with Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight. Did have fun counting how many scenes had steam in them, not to mention the hazy indoor shots. I guess Tony Scott takes the word atmosphere literally. Loved that fire dept too. From alarm to transport of victims within 60 seconds usually. Just asking for a LITTLE common sense once in a while...jeeze..."
2,"Fair, but not good, actioner","I didn't like THE NET, nor do I like ENEMY OF THE STATE. Both have your typical hard-workin', tax-payin', common-sense citizen hunted mercilessly by wealthy white folk with far, FAR too many resources at their disposal.Plot holes are vast and plentiful here, such as ""If these guys are so good, why didn't anyone check out the conspicuous camera box right across the launching dock?"" and ""If these guys can do that much to one man already, do they really need a bill?"" Plus, you also get, ""With digital photography and editing, who needs two people in the same place at the same time anyway?""What makes this movie rise above the usual B-movie muck is...well, not much. Sheer budget size and star power manage to muscle this movie from the lowly one-star rating it deserves to the two-star rating that it doesn't."
4,great thriller for the 90's,"Action-wizard Tony Scott's latest is a technically brilliant, visually stunnung experience that is also very frightening. Let's all pray that this will remain fiction - always. Or is it already too late...?"
5,a surprising two thumbs up,"when i originally rented it i thought it would be okay to have on as background noise while i did other stuff around the house.nope. sat down and was glued to the screen from start to finish. i liked seeing the technology. lol.. unfortunately my perception of this movie and what i got from it was -reasons NOT to have this kind of invasive technology- i think osama bin laden would've gotten further along and even faster if this stuff was really around. (just my humble opinion).the two leading actors did fantastic. will smith's character, well i really liked him, and his attitude. and the same for gene hackman. i still pop it in once and a while and think.. i wonder if these ""i only think of what i need and want to"" people will ever realize how easily and swiftly we can lose our simplest rights. privacy is no big deal. until it's gone."
1,Extremely disappointed - I will never buy from MovieMars again!!!,"I ordered this movie on 11/28/12 and it took two weeks to get here. When I opened the package I heard a rattling sound. I opened up the case and the DVD was not in the protective circle in the middle, it was just flopping around and was very scratched. I mailed it back right away. After I ordered I noticed this on the page ""This DVD will not play on most DVD players sold in the US or Canada [Region 1]. This item requires a region specific or multi-region DVD player and compatible TV."" Why would a company sell a DVD in the US that wasn't for this region? I will never buy anything from MovieMars again!!!"
3,Gamma Ballhopper Nice Design but few design flaws,"The Rollerhopper 150 is probably the best ballhopper out there, with clever design and functionality, however some of the mechanisms do not work as smooth as a regular user would expect them:1. The pins that hold the basket in place in the standing position are not strong enough, so the basket tends to go lose constantly.2. The plastic leg holders are not designed well, as you need to apply a lot of pressure to lock and un-lock them, making them very hard for a kid to use or even adults.I will contact them to order longer pins for the basket holder.Overall good value but these little imperfections might cause some people to get frustrated and not enjoy it."
1,Save Your Money,"I would not spend my money on one of these again. One of the latches has already broken after about a month of use.It ""squirts"" the balls quite often instead of picking them up. I can pick up my balls with two baskets quicker than I can with this thing.Not worth what I paid for it."
1,Soundtrack to Hell,I had read some initial reviews and thought that this sounded like an interesting album...I am all about experimental music & free form Jazz. This is the soundtrack to hell. Others may dub this music for a really bad acid trip.
5,Great for any true White Sox fan,"Great detail about the team, its great history and the fans. A must for any true White Sox fan. Great size for a coffee table book to show everyone that you are a real Sox fan!"
3,Bang bang shoot 'em up,"Husband loves the genre. Jimmy Caan was good, but just not this woman's cut of tea. If you like the movie formula, you'll like this one."
2,Thriller Elite - NOT!!,"I remember The Killer Elite.It was touted as a martial arts extravaganza, with then-famous martial artists from the seventies filling several roles and appearing in an ultra-exciting climactic fight. It would surely go down in history as one of the best martial arts movies ever produced.Unfortunately, things did not work out that way.Poor editing left several exciting fight scenes on the cutting room floor. The then-famous martial artists wore ninja suits making them unrecognizable. The great fight scene turned into a comical joke with sword-wielding bad ninjas being mowed down by spies with submachine guns. It was the old ""karate against gun"" joke to the infinite power!!During the move, the bad guy says, ""I forgot the six ""Ps""...proper planning prevents piss-poor performance"".I think the producers of the Killer Elite forgot the same thing!!"

1,Worst Peckinpah Effort,"Wooden acting, confused plot, and a really stupid mix of guns and ninjas at the end make this Peckinpah's worst film. Caan doesn't seem interested in his character at all and Duvall gets cut out of the movie after 10 minutes. I liked the idea of the two friends and the betrayel but the whole philosophical angle at the end came out of nowhere and didn't make much sense. Don't waste your time on this dated action flick."
2,All Action But Not The Least Bit Memorable.,James Caan And Robert Duvall Star in This revenge thriller about two spies one betrays the other and the other plots to get even with him. Another peckinpah disater. No dialouge just dumb action sequences pretty lame i have ever seen. See Caan in Rollerball instead. As for duvall his talent is truly wasted here.
3,The Killer Elite Saved By Cast and Director,"The Killer Elite is a low key action movie with a little martial arts mixed in. Directed by Sam Pekinpah, it boasts a great cast including James Caan, Robert Duvall, Gig Young, Mako, Bo Hopkins, and Burt Young. There are a couple of hilarious moments, but the movie is a little dated compared to today's action movies. Meaning the action is far and few between. The story is about two CIA operatives (James Caan as Mike Locken and Robert Duvall as George Hansen) pitted against each other. Duvall's character betrays the CIA and at the same time cripples Caan's character. Caan fights his way back to a CIA position and is reassigned to protect an important foreign dignitary and recruits old pals for his task force. These characters provide somewhat of comic relief (Burt Young and Bo Hopkins). Pekinpah's direction is great despite the weak script and ample action, but somehow one feels that there should have been more to show with such a great cast."
3,"Not a complete waste of time , but do not expect too much","It is always sad when , for whatever reason , someone who has a strong reputation releases material with their name still attached , but without the former quality .That is the best description of this movie . It feels like scenes are missing .I encourage you to seek out and watch Sam Peckinpah's earlier , better films . The two lead actors are not shown to best advantage - I am a James Caan fan , but didn't feel much was asked of him in the film .Rent it if you want to see all of Sam's films .I have traded my copy . I won't miss it ."
3,Bungee Bird Rope Toy,The 96-inch size is too big for an African Grey. They can climb on it but the next size smaller would have been much better. This size is good for a Macaw or Cockatoo.
4,"Cool product, but our AG parrot doesn't seem to care for it.","Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty neat little product here, but our AG parrot is pretty shy when it comes to new things, and he has yet to take to this being anywhere near him for quite a while now. Oh well, maybe you'll have better luck."
4,Re-doing my file cabinet,This product is really great because you can remove a label that accidentally has a mispelled word or something else that might be wrong. I would recommend them.
4,Handsome heroes/hot romance,"I love Jennifer Blake's books. The heroes are great--handsome, brave, always great in bed. I like her settings of New Orleans and other areas of the South. I have just started buying and reading her books. I am really impressed, and I've read a bunch of historical romances. Her historical accuracy is exceptional, and the love scenes are frequent and fantastic. She has an understanding of the different cultural backgrounds of the Louisiana area--French, Spanish, American, and weaves this knowledge into great novels. I also enjoyed ""Perfume of Paradise,"" and ""Prisoner of Desire,"" both outstanding works."
1,Regurgitation Royale,"Same old plots! Change the characters names, change the city name, and put a picture of Fabio with a ripped shirt on the cover."
5,VERY GOOD,"This is just very good set. Richard Strauss is one of the best composers of the lieder. Probably, the third one after Schubert and Wolf. Trust me, you will enjoy this set very much."
1,A poor excuse for a learning tool.,"This book is touted as a beginners volume yet it fails to perform as specified. The contents are poorly written and few examples are given to help in the learning process. To further complicate the learning of a new language, Puntos de partida provides very little explanations and direction to ensure sufficient comprehension and understanding of the Spanish language. Unfortunantly, this review can speak for most Spanish text books on the market as my Universities Spanish program has realized. Puntos de partida will not help the beginner to learn Spanish. It will deter the beginner to seek further understanding and learning of the Spanish language. This is unfortunate."
2,wasnt useful,"Unless you buy the textbook, workbooks, and cds all together as a set, its very easy to mismatch cds to the editions."
2,Not the greatest teaching tool.,"I found this book to be very difficult to follow. As a student the book jumps from one subject to the next with not much emphasis on vocabulary as I feel should be. The excercises given are obscure, and some are down-right useless. However, this book does give some extensive explinations on gramatics and usage of words.This book is best for reviewing or referencing. Using this book as the only way to begin learning the spanish language not what it was made for."
1,Undelivered item!,"I have not received the item yet! I ordered it about a month ago, wrote to the seller a week ago, the date by which it was supposed to arrive, and have not yet heard back."
2,Eight and a half minutes of ads on the front of the video,"Blue's Clues is nice and all that. The episode is okay. But I am overwhelmed by disgust at the eight and a half minutes of commercials they saw fit to tack onto the front of a thirty-minute video.I would hope the producers of this video are trapped someday in a living room with five children all screaming at them ""I want to watch LITTLE BEAR / CHARLIE BROWN / DORA / WHATEVER"" while they try to fast-forward through commercial after commercial after commercial.Way to annoy the parents, guys. It's a nice show, but I see no reason to pay for the privilege of skipping nearly nine minutes of ads."
1,"the table is nice, but your description is WRONG","this table is mostly perfect. it went together easily and does everything it is said to do EXCEPT it does not vary in height from 25 to 40 inches. at it's lowest setting, this thing is about 35 inches high, which is WAY to high for the workspace we purchased it for. we bought this one SPECIFICALLY because it was said to go as low as 25 inches. the description should be corrected so more people don't waste time and money on getting a product they can't use."
1,Too high,This table is too high to sit in a chair in front of the TV and work on. I bought it assembled it and how it just sits in a corner with plants on it. Totally disappointed.
1,stay away,I bought this movie because I saw the awards it won on the back of the case and thought it would be good. I know it was low budget but the acting was horrible the plot was just stupid and a couple of the characters were just annoying. The character developement was very weak and the movie consisted of a few people who bought stolen drugs getting chased around empty warehouse and that was it. The villians were not very believable with the acception of one guy. Very overpriced also.
5,VERY COOL!!!,"Oh my god, this is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I thought the black face cover was cool and I loved RESEVOIR DOGS (there's a quote comparing it on the front) so I rented it. I popped in the cassette and couldn't stop watching. It's f**cking intense! I thought my head was going to explode.I just bought the DVD and it has alot of good stuff on it, especially deleted scenes with commentary. I definitely recommend it for any film enthusiasts."
4,The best IR thermometer for the money,"The Fluke model 561 infrared thermometer is an excellent buy. It is the only IR thermometer that I found under $250 that had an adjustable emissivity. Since not all surfaces radiate infrared equally, this can be a very important feature. The model 561 also can accept K type thermocouples for use in making contact temperature measurements. As an added feature, this model comes with a special K type theromocouple mounted in a velcro strap for wrapping around pipes for direct contact measurements. The plastic case is nice, too. I researched every model of IR thermometer under $500 for a month, and this was the best that I found. The only drawback is that the switch that changes between Celcius and Farenheit is inconveniently located inside the battery compartment."
4,Fluke 561IR,"Easy to read display, We will use it in the field, As all fluke's instruments, they are very reliable and accurate, my only observation is the K thermocouple reading does not have decimals, it give you full numbers, this feature would give a big plus for the instrument."
5,Very Satisfied,I use this product as a tool for sales. I visit many different manufacturing operations involving high temperature bearings. The customer usually does not the actual temperature of bearings in operation. This tool has enabled me to acquire live temperature reading to assist the customer in bearings selection. This is an easy to use tool that has saved our customers thousands of dollars.
2,"Yeah, well, consider the source... but it's got Krupa!","I agree with the other reviewers - hardy the best swing CD out there. But, it's LaserLight - what do you expect? Only 10 tracks, iffy mastering, nonexistent annotation. On the other hand: this is the easiest to find among very few CD's that capture Gene Krupa's spirited 1945 take on ""Jingle Bells."" It's a good performance of Krupa's Jazz Trio (with pianist Teddy Napoleon and saxophonist Charlie Ventura) and a decent recording taken from a radio transcription (that is, not an official release at the time). Again, not absolutely essential, but a delight for collectors."
3,"Doesn't ""Swing"" as much as it claims to","The main selling point for this disc has to be its bargain basement price. I would probably have called it 2 stars if I had paid regular CD prices. The simple fact is, it is not really as ""swinging"" as its title claims. Some of the tracks are downright dull. The best tracks are the three that are taken from ""The Nutcracker"" (""Dance of the Suger Plum Fairies"" by the Larry Clinton Orchestra, ""Parade of the Wooden Soldiers"" by Red Nichols & His Five Pennies, and ""The Nutcracker Suite"" by the Les Brown Orchestra. Another worthwhile track is ""He'll Be Coming Down the Chimney"" by the Guy Lombardo Trio. On the whole, it is about half a swinging big band Christmas."
5,More L'Amour,Great unabbridged wrk of living on the land. Can't wait to get more of his stuff on CD for my commute
5,Great clean adventure pre-western!,I read this to my son and he loved it. The whole Sacketts series is wonderful and a great series to read kids. The language is fairly clean and there is so much to learn about the early American settlements and discoveries. The is the first where he actually goes to the new land (America).
2,Not worth the price,"The book's content is good. It is, however, a very short book, and not worth the price of a new book. If you want to read it, buy it used or go to the library."
5,No better author has ever lived....,L'Amour tells a tale and teaches history at the same time . I have read his stories since I was a child and never get tired of them . These books will endure till the end of time ....
5,Great Easy Reads,"this series is excellent, especially if you are a fan of the frontier life and westerns. i would recommend these books to anyone."
5,no title,After having read all three books - Wow! She deserved the Nobel Prize. This last book is a great read - much exciting stuff. And how she understood what a mother feels about her sons - and their leaving her.
5,One of the best holistic health books out there,"I can't say enough good things about this book. It explains how all the body's systems work in laymen's terms and what to do to support and balance each one. It goes into different holistic therapies and how they might work or not work. Just the author's explanation of how cancer works is worth the price alone, not to mention the section on cholesterol. But, there's so much more. If you're trying to decide between this book and The Amazing Liver and Gallbladder Flush, this one also has the flush, just not as much detail on how the liver and gallbladder work."
5,Available Again !!,"For those seeking a copy of this classic reading on CD, long out of print, it is now available from CD Japan on 2 discs and on made-to-order CDRs from Arkivmusic."
2,Self-indulgent,"This book may be helpful if you are simply looking for a list of movie recommendations, but as a movie guide, it is a patchy collection. There doesn't appear to be any unifying theme or logic behind the films included in the book and the reader may suspect that the book is simply a list of every single foreign or cult film the author has seen. The whole project might be redeemed by some good writing, but even that is lacking, the capsule reviews mostly consisting of a synopsis and the author's opinions. The synopsis is redundant for those who have seen the movie and a spoiler for those who haven't. The author's opinions are occasionally provocative, but for the most part, uninspired. Without a distinct critical voice, the book is merely an exercise in self-indulgence. Having an opinion is not very hard."
5,An absolutely phenomenal talent,"Wow, this album blew me away. I am in awe of LeAnn's vocal talent. This girl has IT. This album is an unbelieveable work perfectly well-crafted to suit her voice.What she can do with her voice is amazing, as she proves in the title song ""Blue."" ""Hurt Me"" is a painful ballad, and LeAnn delivers all the emotion of that song with her voice; the drawl she sings with expresses the lyrics precisely. ""My Baby"" is a mature song far beyond her 13 years but she handles that song like an experienced adult. I'm also impressed by her ability to sing softly and be convincing at it, which she is in ""Honestly,"" ""I'll Get Even with You,"" and ""Fade to Blue.""No wonder LeAnn became a superstar with this album. This album is incredible. The songs are perfect for her voice and LeAnn's extraordinary talent gives her the uncanny ability to bring justice to each song."
3,She can't take the place of Legendary Patsy Cline,LeAnn has a beautiful voice but her age is the real issue in the music. How can a 13 year old convey the meaning of true love and the lose of love when she has not even lived life yet. Yes LeAnn is a beautiful girl with a beautiful voice but she needs the years of experience so that her music can really touch the hearts of people who have lived the pain and joys she sings about. A young lady like her needs to be more conscience about the songs that she sings so that her beautiful voice will not be lost in the mature topics she needs to wait to experience. Patsy Cline sang these types of songs but her live experiences were conveyed in her music. She lived through the lose of love and the feeling of true heartach. Patsy had the right to sing these songs because she was a survivor not a mere on-looker. Once LeAnn gets her badges of experience then she has every right to sing a Patsy Cline Song. Till then she needs to sit back and live life.
5,LeAnn is the best I love her music,I would give it a five because i have heard her and she has inspired me to want to sing and write songs
3,"Eh, not the best CD in the world.","I really like the song The light in your eyes, but other than that, I hated this album. It really was not worth your money."
3,i haven't heard this cd...but i bet it's really nice,i feel like this cd is intellectually fulfilling and satisfies the soul. like a summer breeze blowing through the pasteurs and filling your hair with the sweet smell of honey dews and lilys and other stuff that smells really nice. yes...it is a great albulm ladies and gentlemen...i bet...
2,hyped way too much,"when I first heard Blue, I thought, wow what a great song and I can't believe that it's sung by someone so young. So I went out and bought the CD. It starts out great. Hurt Me, One Way Ticket and The Light in your Eyes are really good songs, but the rest of the CD is terrible. Some songs, like my baby make me want to destroy the CD. They aren't even listenable."
5,This is a Great Debut,"This is a great album. The first time I heard the LeAnn Rimes commercial for ""Blue"" in Australia, ""One Way Ticket (Because I Can)"" was playing. I fell in love with it as soon as I heard the first ""...standin' on the corner, lookin' out into the great unknown..."". I had to get it. ""One Way Ticket"" is just one of the 11 gems on this masterpiece. The soulful rendition of ""Blue"" and ""Hurt Me"" capture the moment and ""Fade to Blue"" and ""Cattle Call"" totally immerse you in the situation all thanks to Ms. Rimes INCREDIBLE voice!"
1,Buy the single instead,"Don't get me wrong: LeAnn Rimes has the most gorgeous voice in country. In the title track, she really sounds like she's channeling Patsy Cline. It gives me shivers. The trouble is the rest of the songs are just not very well chosen at all. ""Hurt Me"" is the only other one that's bearable. I'm sorry, but a 13-year-old singing ""Good Lookin' Man"" makes me think of Jon Benet Ramsay. And the photos that come with the CD, where she's kind of tarted up, are creepy too. I almost kept this CD just for the first song, but in the end I got tired of jumping up to turn it off when that song was over, and sold it back. Save your money. Wait until LeAnn gains a little more emotional depth with experience, and some material that can do justice to her voice."
2,LeAnn Is a brat. She is so stuck up. Can you say SPOILED?,"In Case you are thinking that i am a stuck up brat, I am just opinionated. I am a firm believer that LeAnn Rimes is a stuck up brat. She had a Ford Expedition and a Dodge Viper and she couldn't even drive them. So if you think that she seems really nice don't read this.... LeAnn Rimes is a stuck up brat. Just a conclusion, Her music is okay but Shania is BETTER!!!"
3,Great title song,"The title song is great, & this album is worth buying just for that, but her singing on the rest of her songs has yet to mature & consequently, her music has been going downhill ever since...."
1,"oh, dear, put it out of it's misery......","What is up with her screchy voice. Patsy Cline is probably turining over in her grave from leanne singing her song. If I could give this cd no stars, I would."
2,BAD!,"COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER!THIS CD ALMOST SUCKS!BUT HOLD ON A MINUTE!I`M HER BIGGEST FAN,BUT THIS IS MY LEAST FAVORETE ALBUM BY HER!"
1,AWFUL,THIS BOOK HAD MANY ERRORS AND NOT WORTH THE MONEY I PAID FOR IT. ACTUALLY THREW IT AWAY! THERE ARE MANY OTHER BOOKS OUT THERE THAT ARE BETTER AND SOME EVEN LESS EXPENSIVE WITH ACCURATE INFO!
2,ok book,"This book was OK, although I wish the answers were explained for you. I used this and the book ""Registry Review in Computed Tomography"" by Daniel N. DeMaio to study and I passed my CT exam the first try after not having taken a test of that nature in 30 years!"
4,"And now, for something completely titanic...","Starship Titanic is not based on Hitchhiker's Guide, but is very similiar in style. The game is very good, but can be difficult at times. However, unlike most games where dialogue is just something to proceed the plot, in this game it is actually a funny and entertaining diversion thanks to the great dialogue engine and voice acting. Between the funny, but annoying parrot and the Elevator attendant who constantly talks about his wartime exploits (what war, we don't know). Buy this game if you want a funny and interesting ride. Also, buy the book to learn about the story."
4,I love this game,"I love this game! I had it when it was first released and played it many times. Then I loaned it to my son who spilled soda on it. Boo-hoo. Been without ever since.Now I am re-purchasing. I still have all my old accessories including my ""Don't Panic"" button and 3-D glasses. I can't wait to plug it into my Mac and play again. It's like an old friend.The only reason it didn't get 5 stars on the overall rating is because sometimes the bots can be a bit tedious while other bits are repetitious. I love it anyway. For me it is a relaxing change from everything else. Rather like slipping into your old comfy house slippers."
2,I expected a very complex and fun game,"That was what I expected. I feel that the game was a let down overall because I kept expecting something really cool to happen, but it pretty much never did. It was kind of interesting at best. I gave two stars because three would indicate that I found it worth while. Most of the puzzles where either easy, or lacking in the ability to be solved without hints. I don't think I could have done it without the strategy guide that came with it. Also, I found that one of the puzzles didn't work in the way the manufacturer probably intended. To be fair, the humor was funny and very PYTHON which I liked. Additionally, I thought the whole concept was very good and I kept expecting some cool things to happen, but ultimately it did not pan out. Good Try."
5,Superb Color!!,"Bought as a gift for my girlfriend last week. She loved the very bright color of the stone. She is a little short and this belly ring is a little on the long side so it does look big on her but she said she really liked it and the size didnt bother her. I received this in 3 days, I would definitely buy from Body Candy again with how fast they sent this ring."
1,"poorly written, don't spend a lot of money on this book!","I purchased this book for an upper level course at a private university and was astounded at how awkward the writing is! For example, ""Rural minority members experience considerable."" That's an actual sentence from the text, and it is not the only poorly written, horribly unclear sentences in the book. Reading the text was tedious because the grammar and syntax of the authors is messy and awkward. They should fire their editor. Don't spend more than $10 on this book, and buy it only if it is absolutely necessary."
5,Great shopping experience...definitely recommend this seller.,"This transaction was very easy. I ordered this book for a class I'm taking, and it arrived in time and as described."
1,Never Received it,"The book was apparently out of stock when I ordered it, so I ended up having to buy the book for nearly $40 more at the bookstore a week later than I needed it."
3,A quick guide,"I actually received this book as a gift upon my graduation. I would recommend it if you are looking for a book where you can quickly look up a word or phrase in which you had a dream about and quickly get an overview of what it might mean. If you are looking for something more detailed, I do not recommend this book. Otherwise, it is top quality if you are looking for something simple, and makes a great gift, in my case!"
5,Better the 2nd time,"The reason Good Will Hunting works so well, is, not because of its though-provoking ideas and questions, but because of the small things people (critics especially) usually do not recognise. Some might not realise, but the characters in this film is one of the most starkly realistic I've EVER seen. The way they talk, and the way they react emotionally are what everyone can relate to. Matt Damon should have won the Best Actor Oscar, but Nicholson won with a much simpler role than his and I'm sure the Academy wouldn't give a Best Actor oscar out to a young rookie like Damon. Damon must really be a genious for creating (along with Affleck) one of the tightest, realistic scripts of the alltime! Truly one of the best of this decade, one which you can see over and over again, learning more and enjoying more each time."
5,Overall excellent movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. Damon&Affleck were 95% accurate on the boston accent. What ticked me off was Robin Williams character was originally from South Boston ""Southie"" his accent was not even 50% accurate. The boston accent is very unique, most of you probably have never heard one in real life. I have seen this movie 4 times, and it is better every time!"
3,toshiba sd-3109 owners... try regular version,I tried 3 collector's edition dvd.. all of them had double layer gliches toward 2/3 of the movie.
5,In my top 10,"Another great film which is one my favorites. I've seen it many times already. It's a got a great cast. With a very inspiring story. A movie that's got a little bit of everything from comedy, romance, drama and action. Watch it if you haven't done so yet. Glad to see its availble on blu ray."
5,Great movi,"Good Will Hunting along with Shawshank Redemption are the best Guy movies ever. I think Shawshank was better, but not by much."
4,Very good movie,I would recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I think this is the best work for both Matt Damon and Ben Aflack.
4,Great Film. Dangerious Digital Copy for your Mac,"Film looks and sounds great when enjoyed via blu-ray media.If you use a Mac or iTunes to download the digital copy, DO NOT allow it to install a program called ""Rosetta"" when it prompts you to!All you need to do is redeem the code included with the package in the iTunes store and download the digital copy.I was in a hurry and wasn't paying attention to what I was clicking on and iTunes ""closes unexpectantly"" every single time I try to play any of my movies downloaded from iTunes after allowing the digital copy disc to infect my macbook.Oh, and iTunes takes mulitple attempts to open now, with the same ""iTunes closed unexpectantly"" messages."
1,I don't know why this movie was so liked.,"I saw the movie in a theatre with a friend because I liked Matt Damon in The Rainmaker. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I thought the movie was boring and that Damon's character was way too negative and hard to take.After hearing that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck wrote the screenplay, the only thing I can say is ""don't give up your day job"". I thought this was a terrible waste of Robin Williams talent because he has been in several good films.Anyway, I know a lot of people are going to disagree with me, but I thought this Movie was far overrated."
1,Essential hollywood product,"The most overrated movie in years. Contrived, shamelessly sentimental, and above all cliche-ridden. The perfect example as to why you should take Amazon.com's ""Essential"" label with a grain of salt. (Van Sant's ""Drugstore Cowboy"" is much better than this dreck.) If you think this has ""emotional depth,"" you probably find ""Hee-Haw"" enthralling."
1,Pee-yoo! A profane and obnoxious bore.,"This film was offensive from the beginning and only got worse. An interesting premise and some talented actors get lost in the morbid facination with cursing and shallowness of character. The accolades given this film are simply misplaced. Don't waste your time. Get a real film like Brother Sun, Sister Moon to be inspired."
1,Good will Hunting - Not so Good,"I was excited to see the movie based on the actors but the language was foul just to be foul. It completely ruined the movie for me because of it's constant use of the ""F"" word. Enough already. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,Self Congratulatory and Ridiculous,"Misunderstood, sexy young ""badboy"" genius with a heart of gold? Really knows how to fight, too? Gets the chick in the end?Ugghh...like a bad romance novel.VERY puzzling why people went ape over this flick.But I was NOT surprised when Van Sant's ""Psycho"" remake turned out to be as hideous as it is."
2,"Dullness, thy name is Good Will Hunting","Despite all the hype about Good Will Hunting, I was dissapointed. The movie dragged along and tried to be oh-so-deep-and-witty.The message seemed to be ""Don't worry about your own actions, society is at fault.""And am I the only one who did *not* think that the 'apples' scene was hilarius?"
4,From the mop to the top!,"This film shows one of the best reasons for a society - like ours - that has space for those who are in the bottom of society going to the top, or at leist those who want to. This has good acting and good producer realism. This struggle of a janitor to get out of his humble Boston circumstances to the top of the educationational centers of our nation by his supreme knowledge acquired at a library is astounding. It has excellent dialogue, is character driven and has realistic background. It's a bit too word raunchy for smaller kids, and is best for adult audiences."
4,Better Will Hunting than given credit.,"After reading numerous reviews, i failed to see what i found most important in matt damon's involvelment on the film. Everyone is raving about his performance, however most forget that the screenplay was adapted by damon and affleck. A fact that i am surprised the self claimed movie buffs forgot. Just thought it was worth a mention."
3,Whats with all the F-words?,"This movie is funny, creative, although a little unbeliavable. My only real complaint, however, is the swearing. A little swearing in a movie is almost...necessary, but come on, even if these guys are blue collar, all the f-this and f-that makes them sound like stupid little hoodlums with nothing to say, which clearly, they're not. I suppose I would have been inclined to rate it 4 or 5 stars had I not counted 253 incidences of the f-word in the 2 hour span."
1,Hideously juvenile silliness...,This movie grabs & assimilates every smug sentimental cliche ever to appear in film or print. The scenes between Damon & Driver are as artificial as could possibly be imagined. Williams heaving up massively shallow platitudes (one more time) is the crowning touch. How depressing that so many found in this film some form of significant human statement. It simply shows how deeply we continue to regress as a culture.
1,Am I the only person in the whole world who hates this film?,"THIS FILM IS SO BORING!!!While the acting performances are good, there is never even a hint of action in this self-smug piece of American junk. All that happens is some stupid cleaner gets good at maths, visits a therapist, and, erm, that's it really. Unless you're a greying 50 year old with an interest in people talking to each other for two hours, this film is NOT worth paying for."
1,Completely over-hyped,"While I think it's great that two young guys could win an Oscar for Best Screenplay, I was so disappointed in this movie. The only thing I enjoyed about it was Robin Williams. The rest of it was boring; I found myself reading a magazine and picking up a Sue Grafton novel while my boyfriend watched in earnest as Will kicked some guy's butt and smarted off to his court-appointed shrink."
1,It's not worth it,"After seeing reviews and the commercial on television, you would think this would be a good movie, especially with the great Robin Williams. But, after I rented this movie I find it filled with trash talk that takes away from what I thought the content would be, among other things. This is really, to me, not a must see."
3,A good movie but the same amount of slow parts as good parts,This movie is slow. But it only gose fast when the good scenes show up and in this movie it is hard to belive but it felt like this movie was going for 3 hours when it was going for almost two hours but trust me you can tell.
2,Very Dissapointed,"I avoided this movie because like most males i have an aversion to all things Ben Affleck, However after seeing him in Chasing Amy - i realized he had some talent and with the strength of a strong script and compelling storyline a good movie could be had. Well, this movie had neither - what is even worse is that there is a germ of an interesting story here but its so glossed over by cliches, a poor script and easy plot lines that you could turn off the volume and follow the story without missing a beat."
1,Juvenile nonsense,"This movie really deserves 0 stars. Whoever wrote the screenplay obviously knew nothing about mathematics and mathematicians. Damon's character is supposed to be a mathematical genius, yet it seems like he doesn't really know any mathematics and is just faking it. I doubt whether Hollywood filmmakers have the maturity to make a movie about a mathematical genius that is realistic and honest."
5,A great movie!!!!!!!!1,"What's not to like? Romance, action, and conflict... Much better than the movie that one best picture last year!"
1,NOT A GOOD MOVIE AT ALL!!,This movie did not appeal to me at all. I am not offended by the use of swear words in movies but there was so much in this movie that it just got annoying. Curse words just lose their impact when they make up three fourths of the script. I am a male and especially didn't like the scene where Matt Damon and Minnie Driver were in bed and all of a sudden you see Matt Damon's head slowly going down on her. The implication was really disgusting. I nearly threw up just thinking about what he was doing. Keep in mind that I am a perfectly straight guy. I didn't even care whether Matt Damon's character got a life or not.
1,YAWN!!!!,"Not that anyone cares, but I have never liked Robin Williams as an actor. This movie only proves my point. It was just, well, BORING!That's all I can say. See it for yourself!"
1,Boring!,This was the most over-rated movie. There was not one original thing about it. The moment when it was finally over was bliss.
1,Trash,"My sister rented this ""movie"" during Thanksgiving for the family to watch. We mostly talked over it. Then we took it out and watched something on TV. When is Hollywood ever going to learn to talk without gutter language. It's starting to get boring."
1,What a terrible movie,"This was the stupidest waste of time I have ever seen. Thank God I didn't go and pay $8.00 to see it in the theater. I nearly committed suicide after realizing that I spent $4.00 to rent it. This movie had no point. I highly reccomend that no one waste their time seeing this, but if you must why don't you pick up Howard the Duck, and maybe a couple foriegn films!! The only thing in this movie that kept me awake was Robin Williams. Thak God he was in there or else I might have put my foot through my T.V. This movie REALLY sucks!!!DON'T PAY MONEY FOR THIS GARBAGE!!!"
5,MATT DAMONS BEST!!,"Oh wow, this has gought to be Matt Damons best movie I have ever seen. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from begining to end. I have recently purchase it & viewed at least 6 times. I also enjoyed Robin Williams being a shrink in this movie. It has it's funny moments but, I would still classify it in the drama section. THIS IS DEFINENTLY A MUST SEE FILM!!!!"
2,It's not your fault,"Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who sess through things like this. This story was pretty good, about a genius who hides his talents under a tough guy exterior. And the one scene that I really liked was when Matt Damon has his breakthrough with the ""It's not your fault"" scene. The movie should've ended then and there.Perhaps I am a little prejudiced, I can admit it. I thought this movie was hyped up to be something it couldn't live up to, and it was to me. This was before Bennifer, the Academy Awards, and all the who-dumped-who gossip. All those things shaped my opinion at a later date. Matt Damon is clearly the brains behind the operation, and he got the recognition he deserves, but Ben Affleck is a dingbat who just likes to party.Still, the movie is long winded at times and left me feeling restless the one and only time I saw it in the theater."
2,I am just an old prude...,"but this movie was ruined for me due to the constant use of the ""F"" word and other crudities. I did not like any of the characters very much. Generally, I enjoy Matt Damon's acting a great deal, but ""Good Will Hunting"" in my view is one of the most overrated films of the past 20 years."
5,We should all search for the goodwill of our intellects.,"Searching for who we are and what we can achieve is the basic moral seen in Good Will Hunting. Not only does it portray a brilliant human being Matt Damon, but it teaches us that how we image our potential can help us not deny our true intellectual capabilities. Good Will Hunting is heartwarming tale of believing in ourselves and being independent. A definite must see!!!"
5,Astonishing,"This was one of the best films I have ever seen. All you people out there who are big on morals need to let loose and learn to have a good time. Since I live in Southy, (and frequent the L street Tavern) I feel that it was portrayed accuratley as life in Southy. Matt Damon truly deserved the Best Actor oscar. Yes, I do think that the F word was a bit too frequent, but hey, live with it. And for all of you that tink you are cool by using big words, you're not."
4,Hunting???,"I enjoyed this movie a great deal. I found the complex characters and story line to be most engaging and revealing of issues, we don't often choose to explore. The acting was exceptional. High recommendation."
5,Robin Williams is astonishing,This film is astounding. Robin Williams' performance as a world-weary academic and therapist is one of the most brilliant portrayals ever committed to film. Matt Damon is unbelievably effective as a math genius born to poverty in South Boston who is attempting to cope with his gift and maintain a normal life. Great script and great direction. I would put this film on a list of the 50 greatest films of all time. You must see Good Will Hunting.
5,Tortured Genius,"This is a wonderful film that very thoughtfully explores the life of a young genius who hides his light due to childhood abuse. The story develops gracefully and is never overly dramatic. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are especially good, but all the other actors come through exactly when needed. I plan on seeing this again."
4,"Alright, better most by a long way","At least people are trying in this film unlike most films. At least the fight, and subsequent winning of the fight, has a point to it. Good to see intellectualism winning...for once...It's good to see a suppressed genius angst, letting out his rage and flourishing as a result. Far too many films exist of those who cannot act with overrated, implausible and simply stupid plotlines coming out best in the spiritualist and 'real' world.4 out of 5 stars because Will would've worked out some other way. Other then that the best film I have seen in a long, long time."
4,One of the best,"This has to be one of the best movies of all time. I can't understand why many people diss this movie. They probably didn't understand it. Great acting, great script, but the directing is a little poor. There's a lot of goofs in this movie."
4,Very Good!,"Robin Williams and cast do a great job in this one!! The story is compelling and coherent, and the acting is wonderful. It's not one of those films which drags on. The characters are always interesting and you are always trying to guess what they will do next. I would agree with one review who said ""Ordinary People"" was a better film, but this is a keeper.Robin Williams is one of the most interesting actors and comedians in the world, and almost anything he is involved in is worth taking a serious look at."
3,service is gone,i ordered the wrong product type. i wanted a dvd of good will hunting and didn't realize i had ordered divx. the outside company would not fully refund or exchange for the right product. my advice is try to order directly from amazon.com otherwise they are completely removed from the transaction which i think is unfair. now i'm stuck with this product that i can't use. so much for service. by the way this is a great movie! had to put something in the stars part of the review
3,Middle of the road.,"Good Will Hunting doesn't seem as good as it used to be. The peformances are not that special either, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck still haven't proven they are great actors. Robin Williams steals the movie, he won an Oscar best supporting actor. Damon and Affleck's screenplay is pretty good but not spectacular. I can't really watch this movie anymore, seems shallow and pretentious now and I usually enjoy Gus Van Sant's films."
4,Robin Williams shines,I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be a very tender and wonderful film. Robin Williams and Matt Damon light up the screen. I really felt this was Williams break out role as a serious actor and he showed a lot of range (though he was also great in The World According to Garp early in his career). He totally broke away from the manic comedy routines that can exhaust you and become tiring. Ben Affleck was just poor and a piece of wood as usual but what are you going to do? I guess they were a package deal back then (he and Damon)Mini Driver was also very good. Also Stellan Skarsgard was good as Williams childhood schoolmate who made it good.
5,One of my favorites,I love this movie and have been meaning to buy it for years. It's one of those classics (and will maintain classic status) for years to come. I've seen it maybe 8 or 10 times and still love it every time-there is always a new line to pick out or character to identify with. Fantastico!
4,A movie that makes you think......,"A must have. Good Will Hunting takes you through Matt Damon's role as a headstrong, working-class genius who has run-ins with the law. Although this movie is recommended for everyone, people that use mathematics or psychology as part of their regular life will strongly benefit from the content of this movie. Also, those that live in the Boston area will really enjoy the movie."
5,Good Will Hunting - DVD,Arrived in the condition I had hoped it would. This movie is definitely among my favorites. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are great!
5,Good Will Hunting,"The public and the critics gave this film honors. What more can I add. It is one of my favorites. It shares the struggles of a mixed up, cocky, ""kid"" who has a gift -- mathematical genius - but wishes to throw away his whole life because of fear that has manifested because of his childhood upbringing. Robin William and Matt Damon star, showing the need to develop trust between therapist and client before any healing can happen."
1,Stupid and Unreal,"I swear I must've heard the word F-U-*-*. (You know what comes next) 20 times in ten minutes! Not only does this movie degrade itself with excessive strong language, but sorrily degrades mathematicians too! Those people work their whole lives at becoming what they are, then a non-educated little janitor comes and put them to shame!!! Yea, right!? How on earth could Damon and Afleck have possibly won an Academy award for bst Screenplay? IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!!! Don't even rent this to satisfy your curiosity. STAY AWAY FROM GOOD WILL HUNTING!! Or you won't be so GOOD!"
1,Yuck...,"Hollywood hype wins out again...somehow convincing millions that this is a great movie. Honestly, my husband and I sat there, astonished at how predictable this film was. Worthy of academy awards? My cats could roll better film in their litterbox! There's not much to say about it, as there's not much to it. A very basic story line that may seem compelling to a young child, but not suited for children as the language can be kind of harsh. This film is definately worthy of neither all the awards it received, nor of all the hype. Go outside and play a game of touch football, you'll have better spent your time."
4,This is a good movie - very entertaining,"I really liked Good Will Hunting. I think this movie's intention was not to create cinematic history or surprise the audience with plot twists and turns. I think perhaps it only meant to strike a chord with any viewer who has ever felt alone. Did it speak to me? YES. guilty as charged. It IS a feel good movie, but along the way you get treated to great acting from Robin Williams, good acting from Matt Damon, Minnie Driver and Ben Afflect, and a genuinely funny script. If there is a weakness in the plot it is that boy genius/floor scrubber is a little hard to swallow. But this is ,after all, the movies and I contend that a little artistic liscence should be granted in such matters. The relationship between Sean (Robin Williams character) and Will (Damon) is what this movie is about, and it unfolded with a grace that more experienced writers could not have managed. Kudos to Affleck and Damon for beating the odds."
2,Bad Choice to watch,"The movie did not appeal to me at all!!! There was just way too much cursing for me. Robin Williams is one of my favorite comedians, and that's why I gave it two stars. But I can't believe that he would star in a movie that is as filthly as this one!! I plan on never owning this movie."
1,"Terrible movie, no plot.","One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Boring, and every otherword is f- this and f- that. Extremly vulgar!"
1,Hideously pretentious & superficial...,This movie grabs & assimilates every smug sentimental cliche ever to appear in film or print. The scenes between Damon & Driver are as artificial as could possibly be imagined. Williams heaving up massively shallow platitudes (one more time) is the crowning touch. How depressing that so many found in this film some form of significant human statement. It simply shows how deeply we continue to regress as a culture.
5,Words can't do justice,"For me, this film was about Matt Damon, a brilliant newcomer who came out of (seemingly) nowhere. I was floored by his performance - one of the best of the 20th century. Of course he was supported by a fine cast - Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, and the loveable Minnie Driver, whose onscreen chemistry with Damon was sizzling. Matt is an emerald in a heap of cheap diamonds, and obviously a multi-talented guy - he co-wrote the screenplay as well as starred in it. Well worth seeing."
5,Overall good Dvd,"My Rating is based on video quality, sound, features, and the movie itself.Video quality: I thought it was excellent but what I liked most about this dvd was the anamorphic view. This means a wider than usual widescreen which means a bigger picture for most of us.Sound: Great, nothing to report.Features: I made the mistake in buying the regular version of this dvd. Features-wise it only has a music video as an added extra. A little poor on the features but thats why they have the collectors edition.Movie: The movie itself is a great movie. Set in Boston, the movie caught me by suprise because I usually like action movies and not drama.Overall, I think it is worth it to the COLLECTORS EDITION Dvd. Do not get the regular dvd because for a couple bucks more you can get a whole lot of features."
4,Great set,"Awesome to have a dig copy with Blu-ray for such a low price. One complaint: Digital noise/film grain present a bit. This film was made in the 90's but looks very poorly taken care of. Universal could have done more than simply upscale the DVD version of the film for this releaseBottom line: if you like the film, get this. Its a ridiculously cheap Blu-Ray and you get a dig copy with it."
5,Outstanding,The best seen along time. Other than some cursing and a little violence it can be watched with parental guidence. Recommend viewing for high school and older.
2,Product problem,"The fiilm is excellent. Unfortunately the BlueRay froze two-thirds of the way through the movie and would not progress, skip, return, etc. Repeated efforts were also unsuccessful. It seemed to only be effected/damaged on this product."
3,DVD buzz kill,"This DVD is loaded with features- too bad they're ALL MOVIE TRAILERS AND TV SPOTS! I swear, they put every permutation of the trailer on this DVD and it's a drag to watch them all. It does include commentary by director Guss Van Zant, and actors/writers Damon and Aflec, but it's not very engaging. Menus are not very well laid out either- I kept losing my way around. I give it 3 stars because the story is good, but not good enough to make up for this uninspired DVD presentation."
2,Overrated Movie,"Good Will Hunting received a lot of hype, but I just don't think it warrants it. Robin Williams is excellent and deserving of the Oscar he received for his roll in the movie, but the rest of the cast just had no appeal to me, even Minnie Driver, who I believe is one of the most stunningly beautiful and talented young actresses of our time. I'm not one to get offended at foul language in a movie, but this movie has a lot of it and I believe it is totally unnecessary. All in all, a disappointment."
1,This Movie is a Sure-Fire Cure for Insomnia!!,"This movie was widely applauded when it came out, replete with Oscar Nominations and awards as well. Perhaps I missed something because when I saw this I was expecting something that I did not get. It wasn't fifteen minutes before I was asleep!! This film is a real snoozer....but that's just my opinion. The only thing good about it is that it cures my insomnia when I have trouble falling asleep!"
4,Thought provoking movie,"This movie makes you think about how complex our lives are. The main character has a brilliant mind which allows him to solve math problems that very few are able to do. At the same time he is flawed and has a difficult time forming relationships due to early abuse and neglect. His mentors are also flawed in their own ways. It gives the viewer much to think about. I would recommend this to all mature audiences. The language is deplorable, but goes along with the essence of the character."
4,Numerous Bonus Materials make this a must-get,"Unlike most of my friends, I had never seen this movie in theaters. I saw it for the first time on DVD yesterday, and not a dry eye in the house. I thought the movie was great, but what fascinated me (and my friends) was the ELEVEN deleted scenes that were added as bonus materials. I personally think Affleck is a better actor than Damon, and Affleck had about twenty minutes of footage taken out. Luckily for his fans, you can see it all in this Collector's Version of the DVD. Enjoy!"
2,"Good Movie, bad DVD","No real issues with the film itself, but this disc is awful. Low bitrate (poor picture quality) and non-anamorphic widescreen transfer (so you get those black bars on all 4 sides on your widescreen HDTV). It has been 10 years, isn't it time this got a decent quality DVD release?"
3,The movie said its piece in the first 1/2 hour,"Everyone kept telling me how great this film was and that I HAD to see it. But after seeing it I walked away thinking was that it. There is nothing more. The film is very slow and drawn out, trying to make the small plot seem bigger. The script is so poor. The dialoge sounds written, it feels worked out. It rarely sounds natural. Which is a huge pity, because the idea is very interesting. A lower class boy genius and only one man that can really seem to help him. There was so much room to develope and expand the idea. Yet it never really does so. Robin Williams was brilliant, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck had moments of brilliance. Affleck moreso. There are some moments where real emotion is shown and it draws us in. But the movie always seem to lose that connection. Not all the characters were expanded like they could have been.This movie is good, but it could have been great. A rent rather than buy."
5,it was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life,Ben Affleck was awesome and so was Matt Damon. and I could not believe that Robin Williams made up alot of his speeches during the making of the video just right off hand. I loved it!
2,Please,"Now I saw this movie when I was pretty young, but Good Will Hunting was the most unrealistic drama I have ever seen. The dialog is ridiculous and the acting is terrible. Robin Williams saves this film from being 1 star. Has anyone ever met a genius janitor. I don't think so. The seen where Matt Damon and Ben Affleck get in a fight with two other college students at a bar is a joke. Ohhh let's have a fight and see who can say the most clever line. Give me a break. Spare yourself and rent something that could happen."
1,Cinematic equivalent of a gas station sandwich,"I watched this movie because Robin Williams played a role in it. I dislike both Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but I was willing to give it a shot regardless.It was horrific. It's like someone crashed together A Beautiful Mind with Finding Forrester but left out the heart of either. The protagonist was totally unlikeable, and the lines that were built up as revelatory, genuine, and inspiring were in fact cliched garbage. Robin did what he could with the lines they gave him, and I can't really say any of the leads performed poorly in the film, but what they delivered (however adroitly) was trash.If you want a totally mindless movie about someone smart winning some respect in spite of his ridiculously obnoxious personality, then go ahead and buy Good Will Hunting."
1,Good Golly Miss Mollie.,"I always thought I knew what the F-word meant until I saw this movie. It now has the meaning of a truly wasted 3 hours, maybe even more since I had to drive there and back. Both actors and writers have a great deal of talent, it was just wasted on the F-word movie."
1,Horrible,"Now I see why it took me 13 years to watch this movie, it's just as bad as I feared it might be! Slow and pointless. The boring story of an abused kid with a gift for math. None of the characters are likeable aside from Robin Williams, slow plot, boring soundtrack, just about the worst movie I've ever seen. Skip this one."
3,Good movie!,"After seeing this movie in the theater in 1997 I really liked it. I brought the movie when it came out and I enjoyed it enough but it gets really old and boring after seeing it a million times. However, Matt Damon and Robin Williams did an outstanding job in this movie. I think this would be great to own on DVD then video. If you hadn't seen it rent it or buy it you will love it!"
1,"Boring, Pointless, and Plotless","Would have been a much better movie if it had focused on the older characters, Robin Williams and the other older guy. Who cares about a gifted brat? There are plenty of disadvantaged gifted kids who would have jumped at the opportunity Will could only turn his nose down at. Maybe if he could act...When learning Damon was a co-writer, it was clear where the self-absorbance of the movie came from."
1,"A decent film, though definitely not great.","While there's much about this movie that I do like, I have to say that the swearing is such a distraction that it made it almost unwatchable for me. Personally, I have nothing against swearing in films, except when it becomes a distraction, as it does here. When I start thinking things like ""Can't these people say a single sentence without the F-word,"" or ""Who the heck wrote this stupid script,"" then the magic of the movie experience is lost on me. It's a decent story, though a bit contrived, but the swearing definitely ruins it for me."
1,Not what I thought it was.,"Thought I was purchasing a full screen dvd of the movie. Turned out to be a watch one time only download that appeared to require a special type of DVD player. However, all this was on the unopened package which directs the buyer to a web site for download. The web site explained about the special DVD player. The company took the unopened package back, no questions asked, and refunded my purchase. Good customer service even if I somehow didn't understand what I was buying."
5,Deeply intense and powerful,"I loved this movie. The acting, writing, directing - everything blended together superbly. Lots of intense emotion."
4,A great rock album,"This is my all-time favorite album from a German band, thoughtful working people's protest lyrics incorporated into nicely structured rock numbers -raw, energetic and melodic all at the same time."
1,Look around,"This article is also available on the magazine's website, along with other useful, free information."
4,It's fun to poke around the bridge,"Overall I agree with the other reviews. I purchased this ""game"" when it first came out. It's fun to poke around and play with each station (blow up Voyager? oh my!) The only problem I've had is the E conference lounge access - anybody know how to get in there? I haven't been able to find any hints! Arrgh"
4,Worth Getting,"Captain's Chair is a very interesting look at some of the ships that were on all of the TV series besides Enterprise. Now, I guess because it's called ""Captain's Chair"", it doesn't have DS9 but it does have the Defiant. Overall, I think that the TNG Interactive Techinal Manual is better when it comes to information and more detal. What this has that I didn't see in the TNG Manual was the interviews with the cast. That's right, when you explore the ships, you can find on the capain's chair a button that will have interviews with George Takei, Michael Dorn and so on. They talk about why they wanted to work on Trek and other things. Every ship has an option a tour that can be given by one of the crew voiced by the real actors, but it's only voice and you don't see them. This is a cool thing to have, just for the videos and tours, but I think the Technical Manual probably had a lot more info."
3,Interesting but nothing I would ever want to own.,I rented this knowing it was a low budget movie and accepting it on its own merits it was an interesting story with one really very well used twist occurring in it. I noted three different morals running throughout the story. This is not something I would ever care to own or see again.
2,GB 2525,"very sophisticated but pretty much negative. a lot of futuristic tools for both the criminals and the law. title is based on the song ""2525"". and cannot follow the plot. sort of corny. the acting is so-so."
1,Couldn't Watch it All,"I couldn't watch it past 20 minutes because it was not what it appeared to be. I love Armageddon movies, but It was too depressing and not as well done as I expected."
5,Fantastic,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Great radio, great sound. I have it in my office at work. It's not meant to be played at high volume, but gives tremendous sound across the audio spectum at low to middle volume. Bass is very rich at these lower levels. Radio station preset feature is simple to program and very convenient, as is the alarm. My only regret (my fault) is that I did not get the cd player version. A great product. Well done Boston Accoustics!"
5,Fantastic,"I love this alarm radio - got the platinum one - it is beautiful, simple, and the sound is wonderful. Now I really enjoy waking up to classical music. I also appreciate that it has two alarms. When I took it home from the office the day it was delivered, I forgot to bring the manual. Well, it is so easy, I could figure everything out w/o the manual - which cannot be said for many alarm radios. This one has form and function."
5,"A Great Clock Radio, Worth The Price!","I'm really enjoying my Boston Acoustics Clock Radio. Great sound from such a small unit. Bass and sound are very adequate. FM reception is fantastic with just the antenna wire that came with it, with a short wire hooked on to it. AM is good, but the Grundig g4000 does better on its internal antenna. I got me a Terk AM antenna that I use with the clock radio that really boasts reception. With the Terk it does slightly better than the Grundig. The display is just right in the dark in the dim mode. You can also set it to where it shows the clock even with the radio on.Just press the display till you hear a beep. Very easy to set too. I also like the 60 minute snooze. I'd highly recomend this radio to anyone."
1,NOT as advertised,"Be very wary. Amazon indexes this as an ""hd radio"" and if you search for ""hd radio"" it shows up. IT IS NOT AN HD RADIO. It's just a very expensive ordinary analog radio with a nice display."
1,A Piece of Junk!,"Before buying this radio I read the glowing reviews here and also a favorable comment in Consumer Reports, so I was surprised and disappointed that my experience was so different. It does not receive four of the five main AM stations here in Denver. One comes in very well, two with a lot of interferance and two not at all.I talked to BA's technical service and tried their two suggestions: rigging a wire antenna and moving the radio to different locations. It didn't help much. Their comment: ""Some radios just don't work well in some locations."" I have three other cheaper radios that do work in those locations. The easy controls, presets and rich tone are nice, but if a radio doesn't perform its basic function, for me it is a piece of junk!If you do decide to buy this radio, I recommend you get it from a local store and not on line. The BA reseller, Antonline, is not up to Amazon standards and has made returning it a difficult hassle."
3,Disappointing sound quality,"This is a solid product and has many fine qualities- not the least of which is its reception of weak signals. However when it comes to the most important quality of any radio, sound quality, the Boston Accoustics Receptor Radio is a disappointment. It's not that BA doesn't do an amazing job at producing rich and big tones from such a small product. It most assuredly does. However, it's the choice of tones and the lack of any tonal adjustment that is a disappointment. I've concluded that BA assumes everyone wants bass boost, shrill highs and very little mid-range.. (Different strokes for different folks, I guess). If you listen mostly to rockin' roll, then you might like the tonal range offered by this radio. However, if you are a jazz or classics fan and like flat, unmolested sound reproduction, then you will likely be disappointed with the lack of clear mid range and over boosted bass. On talk radio stations, the added bass tends to garble voices."
5,"Surprising sound for a ""clock radio""","If you are tired of being awakened, or failing to be awakened, by static instead of music this radio will really surprise you. This digital clock radio literally locks onto the station. Multiple stations can be preset for easy station changes. The beautiful deep rich bass that you have never heard on a clock radio really makes listening pleasureable. The unique styling takes a little getting used to, but the platinum color goes beautifully. Alarm functions are easy to use. Another unique function is that the alarm can be turned off from either a button on the front of the radio, or a button on the top. Though this is a little more expensive than most clock radios the sound is REALLY worth the difference. The unit does make a nice table radio as well!"
2,Needs Positive Relationship Building Questions,"I rated this product a 2 because this game is designed to be played be a husband and wife but the questions are questionable.If you are looking for a romantic evening you don't want questions like, ""have you ever had sex with a co-worker, at work?"" Many of the questions do nothing for building relationships. For some of you, it might lead to a fight.The folks who developed questions for this game seem like a bunch of juveniles who don't understand the context of the game. This game would be much better if it had positive relationship building questions instead of Beeves and Butt-head humor."
4,Cool gift,Got this as a gift for my sister and her husband. No idea if they ever used it but I found the game very creative
4,"Braun's Translation is good, but not as literal as others","Braun's translation does a good job of capturing the dramatic intensity of Sophocles' play, but his translation isn't as close to the original language as other translations available"
4,Great stuff,"Great drama. I'm not a huge ""classics"" fan and yet I enjoyed this. If you're into Greek mythology and like flowery language and prose (and lots of melodrama) you will enjoy this. HINT: don't read these plays line-by-line like a poem - I find that it's more difficult to follow them that way. Read this like you would a novel."
3,Mixed Up,"The condition of the book is good, the pages are like new, but the pages are out of order. The book is split up into chunks that are out of order, first there's part of the Introduction on pages 3-16, then it skips to the end of the story and the notes on what different lines mean(pages 49-80). Then it has the rest of the Introduction and the beginning of the story on pages 17-48 followed by the rest of the notes on the meaning of lines, the Appendix, and the Glossary. The pages of each individual chunk are in order, but the chunks are mixed up, so it isn't difficult to read it in the right order, but it's inconvenient."
3,Antigone,"In this part to the Oedipus trilogy; Antigone's brother dies and she has to fight to bury him. Her uncle disagrees with here and that's basically what this sequel is all about. This story is very easy reading. Recommended for ages 15 and olderThis is the second story in the trilogy, and in my opinion it is the best one out of the three. Although all of them are fairly easy to read this one was the easiest for me. For the most part it kept me occupied. Sophocles wrote this in such a way that I actually get into the story. How Sophocles writes this is what I like the most, it's not like a Shakespeare play where you have no clue what is going on because it's really old English. Although this is still an old play it pretty easy to figure out what is going on in it. I would highly recommend that you read the first one before you read this one because there is a lot of information that your need to know from the first one."
2,For those of you considering using Dover's Antigone in class,"Although the Dover Edition of Antigone is inexpensive, the translation is very archiac. I used this book last semester in the hopes of saving my students a few dollars, but we found the translation to be so difficult that the time spent in class ""translating the translation"" made the book less of a value than I had hoped. I recommend a more modern translation for those of you who are considering using this text in class."
1,Wrong Translation,"I found this edition (Dover Thrift) by following a link for paperback from the Braun translation. The publisher reviews on this page indicate it is the Braun.It isn't: it's the Young translation, which is not workable for my classroom because of it's difficult ""KJV"" English. Now I've wasted two weeks in planning my Greek unit, and any hope I had of using Antigone is shot.Teachers: avoid this translation unless your students are advanced. It's isn't worth the money you save."
4,Excellent story,"This book is an excellent show of the determination of a girl who will do whatever it takes to bury her brother, even if it means to defy the king. I loved the ending and the story was just excellent."
3,Good,"The book did not look like the one that is presented in the image, it has a completely different cover, which i didn't really like.however, the book was in great condition. shipped at a reasonable amount of time."
2,Where are the acts?,"Ordered this for my child for school assignment. Assignment was to answer a series of questions for each act. This translation does not identify where each act begins and ends. Does that mean it's a purer translation? If someone cares to enlighten me, I'll amend the review."
4,Soggy Paws,The items came quickly and were exactly what I wanted. They made great stocking stuffers for Christmas and were a big hit. Thank you.
4,A towel is a towel isn't it?,"I'm owned by my pets. It's just a fact. I have two dogs that love to party outside and I have a backyard with a lot of places to get dirty, so when I saw this towel, my first reaction was, I have towels, but I do like it.So I went ahead and bought this towel, even though it was a little pricey, I just had to try it. Well, as it turns out, it was a good purchase. The design of the towel with pockets for your hands is actually very helpful when cleaning off dirty paws and other bits. It's probably even big enough to dry off a whole big dog if they had short hair. But for a little clean-up it's excellent.It's a nice size and easy to store. If you are looking for a convenient way to keep dirty dog paws off your Berber carpet or Tibetan wool rug, you will probably like this towel a lot. You might even want two!"
5,very entertaining and educational,Well written for children but should be read with a parent to get the most out of this wonderfully written and illustrated book.
5,Phenomenal CD! Great Rockabilly!!,I picked up this CD recently together with Rockabilly Rumble Deuce. Golly Gee Records and Raucous Records have put together a winner here. Fantastic modern rockabilly music that has high quality production but with a vintage feel. 24 tracks and an hour's worth of great rockabilly music - this is a deal! There wasn't one bad cut on the record. Purchase with confidence and get ready to bop and jive!
2,I really wanted to like this cd but.........,"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this cd wanting to hear some new rockabilly bands I was not familiar with, but I was severly dissapointed. The quality of the tracks on this cd are mediocre at best and some are just downright bad, the two standout tracks are red hot and real gone by the spinouts(great tune, good hook, excellent slap bass, guitar interplay)The other standout is girl of my dreams,by peter and the wolves, very Elvis, Maries the Name era early sixties sounding. The majority of the other tunes are just dowright pitiful.If you are new to the rockabilly scene, a few helpful suggestions, The Stray Cats, The Blasters, Robert Gordon, The Planet Rockers, Sun era and 56-59 Elvis, Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran, the list goes on and on of better spent dollars on QUALITY rockabilly music, apologies to these artists, but if this is the current state of rockabilly, please somebody help us!!!!!!"
5,Magenta Comes Over,My daughter and all of her friends at our day care center love this video. All of the Blue's Clues videos are great. I love the fact that they are so interactive and upbeat.
4,"Blue Clues, magenta comes over","Received this item faster than expected. It was in good condition, playable too. Would purchase again from seller"
4,Just what I needed,"These are bamboo stakes... nothing fancy, and the green runs off... but I didn't buy them for the color. I think it is a good purchase and exactly what I needed."
1,EWWW,"Smells like a old woman's perfume! The worst Creed ever, too strong and repulsive. Three people told me they couldn't handle the smell of this!"
2,It is good for old people,"It is not bad the fragrance, but is very clear the niche where you can place this fragrance, so if you are 60 or so it is ok but if not, then try something different. Good luck."
1,half full,"Sample was half full, probably a few years old. Better to sample at store, or maybe have better luck off ebay."
3,Hollreiser conducts Rienzi,"Theo Adam, Peter Schreier, and René Kollo are outstanding. Women not so much. Orchestra and chorus are excellent. Fortunately, the conductor's evident (and justified) belief in the significance of the enterprise remains as persuasive as ever."
5,Bayonet Base 12 volt 5 watt Halogen bulb,"I was expecting an incadescent 12v 5 watt bulb and received a much brighter halogen type.I'm using it in a dash board rally light on my motorcycle. It gives off so much more light that I can see to walk around my bike. This helps in not overlooking something I've dropped and would normally drive off, losing it forever."
2,Stanley Socket set,"The tools look good and are organized well. The plastic kit however does not hold the tools very well, many of the sockets fall out and will not hold in place. This defeats the purpose of having the tools organized because you have to put tools back every time you open the kit. The kit is of poor quality."
4,Stanley 89-805 Mechanics Tool Set,"For the price, I was pleased with the quality of the tools. Although I saw that some reviewers did not like the tools that were made in China and preferred the tools made in Taiwan, I could find only one minor defect in the whole set and even that was a cosmetic defect on one socket.My set was made in China. I compared my tools with a Craftsman set (made in USA)that's 25 years old and they are not quite as heavy duty but for the price and for the amount of use they will get (typical homeowner) I think they are an unbelievable value. Plus the selection of sockets far surpasses what I had in my craftsman set. They are not in any way junky and they operate well and have a nice finish. Everything that was supposed to be in the set was, and although a few sockets were loose on delivery, the case seems able to hold them for the most part. My craftsman case broke a long time ago. PLus they have a lifetime warranty. I really don't think you can go wrong with this set."
4,A good selection and value for tools-the case could be improved,"As a household handy man, this set provides a good selection of tools, the quality looks good and the guarantee makes it a good value. The Stanley name has a good rep and I expect these to last a lifetime. On receipt, though, the contents were skewed throughout the case and, I suspect this will happen often as the case gets more use. I think this would be the most common complaint associated with this product. I'm happy with the tools, though."
4,Makes a great gift!,"I bought this tool set for my husband as a Christmas present. It arrived very quickly. It was rather heavy for me to carry in to the the house though, but what did I expect....it's supposed to be heavy duty. When my husband opened it, he was really excited and impressed. There is a huge variety of tools for every need, and they were arranged nicely in the case. One thing though, at times some of the tools slip out of their places when the case is closed or carried.It's a good product nonetheless!!"
4,An Excellent Story,It would be hard to come away from this book without your outlook in life being forever changed. I couldn't put it down.
5,Unforgettable,"I admit that I am a diehard Lisa Samson fan, but this is her best book yet. Pearly Laurel made me cry and made me laugh. I suffered with her when she lost her husband, and I rejoiced with her as she found both healing and a unique family. I was definitely surprised by the ending. This was an I-can't-put-the-book-down read that made me stay up way too late, into the wee hours of morning, just so I could see what happened next."
5,A Nice Reworking of Great Songs,"Snow Patrol says on this EP that they've never really had success playing their songs live acoustically. They're wrong. This is an excellent album, which could only have been made better by making it longer."
4,Mainly for fans,"I love the record because I'm a huge snow patrol fan. Don't expect anything out of the ordinary. The songs that they play here sound pretty much the same acoustically as they do electric. If you want a variety of snow patrol music (no covers, disappointingly), this is a good purchase."
3,Psychologists need this book!,"This is an excellent book of MMPI profiles. It is organized according to profile types and has documentation of many actual cases to show characteristics of people with particular profiles. The book is valuable to the psychological profession but not to the layman. If you use MMPIs for testing, this book is great."
5,Essential Psychopharmacology: the Prescriber's Guide,"Great book! I went to a training by the author on polypharmacy in the treatment of individuals with mental illnesses. I then bought his general ""Essential Psychopharmacology"" book that was fairly complex, but the cartoons made the information fairly understandable for a non medical person like myself. The ""Prescriber's Guide"" is much more understandable and very useful in it's discussion of augmentation medications and ways to combat side-effects. It's presentations of how various medications work is very clear and gives one a good understanding about why one would use one medication verses another given how the illness presents in a person. If I were a general practitioner and certainly a psychiatrist, I would want to own this book."
5,Love This Book,"As usuall Dr Stahl did it again, with beutiful graphics and clear Text, as Psychiatry resident, Dr Stahl is no doubt my Guru, I can not describe, how much his educational material help me understand this complex topic, Psychopharmacology, Highly recomended, i just love it.Dr Johnatan Davidor, ISRAEL."
5,Essential Stahl,Worth every penny--a truly essential addition to the nothing if not essential Stahl library. It includes EVERYTHING on all major (and minor) medications. No prescriber should be without this book.
1,essential of psychotropic,"I feel that I have wasted my money on this book. The book contains only a minimal amount of info regarding psychtropic. In addition, I was looking for a more complete list that what ws provided in this book.I have plans to resale this book back on amazaon]Thanks"
2,easy money maker for author!!,"since their are not many digital photography books for instructors,they pick what they think will fit the bill-it's irritating when they don't even look at the book before requiring it. the book is o.k., butshould not be used for a textbook! it's insulting. to anyone interested inphotography keep this in mind-photography books, especiallythe old and true, and info. on the internet will teach you the basics. because photography is mainly digital, it is very well suited for self-study. don't waste your time buying required marginal books and paying for photography classes. your money will be better spend on good glass(lenses) and a tripod, and of course learn photoshop--just my opinionon a friday night."
2,This book is O.K. I have seen better Rivchin,I found this book to be basic. I recommend a book a fantastic chicago studio photographer lent meChristopher Grey's Studio Lighting Techniques for Photography: Tricks of the Trade for Professional Digital Photographersrivchin
1,Tedious,"What a horrid book. Full of ugly example images, it fails to cover what is really needed in a studio book. The practice quiz after each chapter are a joke, with no answer key given. Some of the questions are over things that the author did not even discuss. Don't waste your time and money."
1,"i agree, just HORRIBLE PHOTOS",LIKE REPULSION when you see all bw photo books. complete UGH! The title and expections from the Title of what it proposes to deliver in terms of Studio photography sure insults you with all those lame photos.
3,"Fun, But Deceptive","My daughter got this for her birthday and loves it, but she and myself are very frustrated by it because she wants me to help her make the bugs on the box, however, the bugs on the box cannot be made with the pieces that come with the set because the pieces described and pictured on the box have holes in different places than the actual pieces so what we make doesn't even come close. Also, first time playing with it one of joints broke in two and could not even be repaired with super glue. It's a shame because this seems like a good toy."
2,Elmo's World anytime you want,"I bought this video hoping it would inspire me with some ideas for my child's birthday party. It didn't help me for that but it is a cute video and my 21 month old likes it. It is 3 Elmo World segments from the Sesame Street tv show (birthdays, games & pets). It is not a separately made movie just copies from the show."
2,Disappointing!,"Although launched as a sensational photo account of the Kursk battle, I must say I'm disappointed. Not nearly all photos are new, the quality isn't impressive and the text accompanying the photos are superficial and very short. I'm glad I bought this book at Amazon.com for a reduced price and not for the full price some other book sellers charge. Definitely not as promised! I have the feeling that all 5 or 6 parts of this series should have been concentrated in one book. Perhaps then it might have been worth the money..."
4,A bit pricey but well worth it.,"I bought this book based on the reviews and was not disappointed. The fact that most of the photographic history of the Waffen SS on the eastern front has been lost makes this series of books a great find indeed. The quality is certainly top notch.The only thing that bugged me was the fact that the captions at the photos were very basic. You have to go to the end of the book to read a more detailed description. I understand that this was necessary to preserve the format of the book but it took some getting used to. Overall, i was very impressed with the amount of research and attention to detail the author showed and will most likely end up buying the whole series; albeit over a period of time my budget can allow!"
4,Good Series,"I purchased all 6 books in the series, the photos are all in black and white none of which I had seen before, quality is good with a basic caption under each photo and a more detail information regarding the photo and what stage of the battle is at the rear."
2,Interesting but not worth the price!,After seeing the clarity of the photos online at the publishers site I was very impressed. When I purchased Volume 1 I was very disappointed in the quality of the photos in the book. I emailed the company and was informed they were disappointed as well and Volume 2 would be a great improvement.Well guess what! Volume 2 and the remaining volumes photo quality is poor and not as clear as those on the companies RZM Web Site. I admire the concept but what were they thinking! Perhaps printing on a higher quality paper might have helped.Do not waste your money is my recommendation.
2,A lot of money for a few pictures.,"Don't bother with this one, it's a thin, overpriced volume with only moderately interesting photographs and uninformative captions. Apparently, the publisher intends this as volume one of several, which, given the qualities of this text, sounds like shameless profiteering. The entire catalog of photos, including those yet to be published should have been offered together in a single volume for this price."
5,A baseball book that is very different...,"This is a unique and wonderfull look at baseball at the end of the century. It's funny, on the mark and the most educational sports book I've ever read. The book truly teaches the fan (experienced or novice) so much about the inner game - not talking stats here - that one feels that you've earned a Phd in baseball when you complete the book. Tim McCarver is not only baseball's best brain, he's its best teacher as well. If you think you know baseball - read this book - you'll learn a hell of a lot more. And most of all - it's fun!"
2,Who edited this thing?,"This book needs an editor. Did they just let McCarver ramble on and type what he said word for word? You literally drown in McCarver's stream of consciousness. There is no organization of thought. Ideas do not flow from one topic to the next. I gave it two stars because I feel there is information to be found in this book if you are willing to wade through the rest of the mess. It's not McCarver's fault, he's a baseball guy, not a writer or publisher. Check it out from your local library and save yourself the money. I'm returning my copy."
1,Worthless ..............,"Wish that I could buy this bird for what I think he is worth and sell him for he thinks he is worth,Total drivel."
1,Does Tim know enough to write this book?,"Anyone who has listened to his broadcasts, or read Durwood Merril's book realizes that Brain Surgery is way out of Tim's league. I would hate for anyone else to waste $$ on this book. Please try Durwood Merrils ""Your out and your ugly too!"" or a classic like ""The Thinking Fans Guide to Baseball."" I also recommend both George Will books over this."
1,"Wow, what a blowhard!","Tim McCarver, you were a good to mediocre player. You're a smart man. Please, please stop writing down lists of observations to insert into your broadcasts. And please, please, please stop writing books. This was given to me as a gift. I use it to hold up up the broken end of a bookcase."
4,Valuable insights from someone who really knows the game,"I learned a lot from this book. McCarver is at his best when describing the little things that go into making strategic decisions, like when to steal, when to hit and run, when to try for an extra base and so on. His insights into baserunning are particularly good. I found some of his descriptions of different types of pitches to be perplexing - what does it mean that a certain pitch ""topples"" (a tree can topple, but how does a round object flying through the air do that?). Overall, this is a very good book, and even long-time fans can get a lot out of it."
3,"Decent; not great, but decent","In the end, basically a decent quality set of tools. They are certainly not mechanic quality (I'm not a pro and I've still handled better), but they'll get the job done as long as you are willing to use a little extra elbow grease and some patience. The rachet mechanism has slipped on me before, when trying to unscrew some particularly evil bolts, resulting in a nice little hand-smashing-into-metal-making-little-cuts-hopping-around-bleeding sort of moment. But considering the abuse I put them through, and for the price, I'm still giving these a decent rating; an occassional mishap is not so bad compared to the utilty of actually having a good, complete set that works 99% of the time."
5,Great Product!!!,"All the tools were of very high quality. Very low price for a set of tools worth much, much more. The only problem was that there were 2- 1/2"" sockets, with out a 9/16"" in this set that was sent me. I'm very satisfied with the product."
4,Good creation explanation for kids,"This is a good intro to why creationism is valid. The case for a creator for kids is for 8-12 year olds, so if you have a mature child I'd suggest the teen edition rather than criticizing a book that is VERY clearly meant for beginner creationists. The simple terms helped my 8 year old grasp the concepts; and in our opinion, this is an EXCELLENT foundation for understanding the logic & importance of a world made by a creator."
2,The Case for a Mature Argument,I read this book and I guess you could say I feel slightly offended. I wish that I could find a book that on Intelligent Design that speaks to people my age without assuming they have no prior knowledge of the topic: this suggests that we live out our childhood with our ears blocked and eyes closed. Any child raised in a Christian family will be somewhat aware of what going on. We don't need to hear about Mrs. Homily and Mr. Axiom; rather we need a bible in our hand and a mature argument in our minds. I have often been called upon to defend the account laid out in Genesis against adults who were far better informed. I would like a way to defend myself.No offense meant. I realize I'm pretty mature for my age and not everyone in my age group can be expected to share these sentiments.
1,A truley sad book.,"I read some of this at a book store, and started to get physically ill from its nonsense. It moved me enough to actually write this.Teaching children this is equivalent to child abuse. This is not educational.Please do not ruin your child's young mind with this.Just because evolution and the big bang are true doesn't mean there is no God. Christians can embrace reality :)"
2,Ingrown hair,This product claims to get rid of ingrown hair and razor bumps. I've been using this product and have seen little to no improvement. I had my hopes set really high based on the previous reviews. So I spent the $ to buy it. I'd have better results out of beauty supply products. I have dark marks from picking at hair. it doesnt lighten those like it says either. I'm a African American female is your wondering.
1,doesnt work.,after hearing all the great reviews about this product i decided to try it. it didn't work i got ingrown hair by waxing for the 1st time.. ( i will never wax again) i tried this it didnt work.. i try tend skin and it worked.. the bumps appear once in awhile dark spots are the only problem now.. so dont buy this product go with tendskin.
2,"Good, but not great","I bought this product after reading all the awesome reviews on Amazon. Although I think it's good, its not great. I realize everyone has different skin types and that's probably it wasn't so great for me. I'm just waiting to finish it so I can buy something else."
3,"Yes it works, but not the miracle I was hoping for","I epilate and razor bumps and ingrown hairs in the bikini issue are an issue for me. I having been using this product twice daily for about 3 weeks now. I think this product has definitely helped bring ingrown hairs to the surface where they become tweezable. Based on the glowing reviews, I was hoping the bumps would reduce more, but do think this product is helping. It is the best I have found to date and will keep using it but I will continue to try other products."
4,not bad,it didn't get rid of all of my ingrown hairs but has definitely helped!i will definitely keep using this as it doesn't dry out my skin like some other products do. it's all natural!
2,Not good.,Ive been try all the after shaves i could get my hands on to try and remove razor bumps and none of them work including this one. This one works the best out of all that ive tried but it doesnt remove all the razor bumps and the redness comes back after 4 hours. I had high hopes seeing as there are so many positive reviews.
3,Did alright,"It seemed to help relieve some of the bumps, but not all of them. I was skeptical about the size, but it lasted a long time, which is a plus. I probably won't buy it again, but overall not a bad product. Might work for others."
2,Another Strike Out,"I picked up this product at a store that I work at and was pretty excited to try something that might actually work. See, I have razor and ingrown hairs all over my legs and being a girl.... well lets just say it not nice to the touch. I've just used up my first bottle. I still have dark spots, none of that improved (perhaps it would work better on the face?). It helped my ingrown hairs some, however I still had a significant amount. I've so far tried everything from AHA to glycolic on my legs after I've shaved and so far no luck. I've just ordered tend skin... so I have my fingers crossed."
2,Not a solution,"I purchased this product months ago and still have ingrown hairs. Yes, it does soften the skin, but the problem still exists. This is not a solution to the problem."
5,Good stuff,"Pricey, shipped quick but well worth the dough.It worked for me and my face was jacked up plus i had bumps on my neck which wasnt cool. I cant say enough about this stuff its good stuff."
4,"Not perfect, but pretty damn good","I've held back on reviewing this for a while because I wanted to make sure it worked over the long term. As it turns out, it does-- to an extent. I like the fact it is natural and doesn't leave a burning sensation, but it does tingle (it might in fact burn if you have sensitive skin). It works like it claims and teases out a lot of ingrown hairs, and tones down the red spots, but it does not entirely remove blemishes and dark spots from previous cases of ingrown hairs. Since removing the hair depends on how fast your hair grows, it's effectiveness as a ""remover"" can vary.It's helped me a lot, but it's not a cure-all for ingrown hair and bumps. While expensive, I find that I don't use that much (but I don't use it for legs), so one bottle will last me a long time. The gel is surprisingly thick and spreads very well. If you need something for a very large surface area, you might want to try something more economical."
1,Contains only all natural ingredients? I guess it depends on how you define natural,"If you don't care what ingredients are in your cosmetics and what you put on your skin, then this review is not relevant for you. For those of you who do care, beware that the ""only all natural ingredients"" advertised on the Prince Reigns website aren't that natural at all. Here is the list of INGREDIENTS:Deionized waterPropylene GlycolGlycerinPolysorbate-20HydroxyethylcelluloseDMDM HydantoinGlycolic AcidFragranceMethyl ParabenPropyl ParabenFD&C; Green#5Tocopheryl AcetateLavanderSageCamomilleQuite a few of these ingredients are highly toxic according to the Skin Deep Safe Cosmetics database. I wish I would have known the list of ingredients prior to purchasing this product, but I couldn't find one anywhere. Hopefully this review will help out those of you who would like to know what's in your cosmetics so that you can make an informed decision if this product is for you or not."
1,This product is not worth the money!,I brought this product and to be honest it did nothing it says!...I actually went out and brought a cheaper product that did work for me. Not only that I tried getting my money back from the company. And someone (I guess CSR) was very nasty told me I had to send back what ever I had to get my money back and when I was still asking questions they hung up the phone before I could finish...I wouldn't recommend to a dog! I don't even want to give a rating they don't even deserve a star at all!
2,No miracle product,This product didn't do much for me. I still have bumps and ingrown hairs and the tiny bottle cost $25 and took forever to receive. Not worth it.
2,I did not see any improvement,After a couple weeks of steady use I failed to see an improvement on a chronic ingrown hair. Maybe is works for those lil annoyances that go away on their own anyway but it was not a help for me.
5,Awesome stuff,"I tried it and it works great, within 4 days. Shipping was quick and though its a bit on the expensive side its worth it.Plus my legs a smooth and silky"
1,Doesn't work and at only 2 oz per container its very expensive!!!,"This has to be one of the biggest disappointments in health and beauty products that I have come across. This serum didn't work for me since I still continued to see razor bumps and ingrown hairs even after 2 weeks of trying it on I am very disappointed. Not only that, but this product is very expensive starting at $20 and more online and only get 2 oz or what appears to be nothing more that sugar, water and food coloring mixed together. I have tried other products which work much better like Tend Skin and Min New York Solution two, both just as pricy as this product, but the other ones at least do what they say. Don't spend your time and money on this lame product do your research first on something else."
2,I did't notice a difference,"I had ingrown hairs (from epilation) and tried this product. I decided to put it on one leg only, to see if I could notice a difference. I applied it once or twice a day for about 2 weeks without noticing any difference between the treated leg and the untreated one. There was some minor improvement, but I concluded that it was due to the body's natural healing process, as the same amount of healing was visible in the leg where no solution was used."
2,not that great,"my skin gets pretty bad razor bumps and ingrowns right along my jawbone. I have tried many products, and this one that i dont use anymore. It worked okay, didn't get rid of 100% of the ingrown hairs, maybe 60%, but it made my skin very oily. I would not recommend"
1,crap,"thick, sticky and useless. I used this product exactly how i should and it did nothing to improve the situation. DO NOT GET IT!"
1,waste of money,I've been using this product for 3 weeks and I didn't see any results I don't recommend it at all.
4,It works,I've tried Tend Skin and a bunch of others but I've been using this for about a month and it really works better than anything I've ever tried. Recommended.
2,Not sure what was suppose to happen,"i did not his this worked at all for ingrown hairs. It felt good after shaving, but did not do waht it was supposed to do."
2,No miracles for me...,After having read all of the fantastic reviews on this product I decided to try it after having tried a few other products specifically aimed at combating ingrown hairs (including Tend Skin which I found pretty useless). I've now used all of my bottle of 'Princereigns' and I'm afraid my ingrown hairs haven't improved much at all. It's a nice product to apply just after shaving as it soothes the area but if you have serious ingrown hair issues like me then save your money!
2,blah,"I was really looking forward to using this stuff and really had faith in it but, nope. I have been using it for a good month or 2 and there are barely any results. I'm not sure if i'm just convincing myself there are slight results or there really just aren't any. It was a disappointment and a waste of money, totally not worth $20-$35. I also read some reviews of people saying it smelt good. It doesn't even really have a noticeable smell i'm not sure if that is a pro or a con I guess that depends on the person. All in all I wouldn't recommend anyone to get this unless it was like $10."
3,Didn't do much,"I've used Tend Skin for years, and decided to try a bottle of this to see how they compared. I do prefer that this is a gel rather than a liquid, but it just didn't seem to work as well. I'm back with Tend Skin."
2,Hmm....,"I used this product every time I shaved for two months. Barely any improvement. Not sure if it's just me, but I won't be purchasing this again. I prefer PFB Vanish, maybe because it's a little harsher. I used it for one week and it was worked much better. Less red bumps and hair that comes in is sticking out straighter so it's easier to shave/pluck."
1,Did not work for me at all,"I had high hopes based on other reviews. But it has not made my ingrown hairs better at all, and actually makes me break out. I've been trying this for 2 months now but I give up. This is going in the garbage."
2,so over-rated!!,"this works ok, but doesn't do all it promises, tend skin works way better but stings, whereas princereigns does not sting. in general, this product is no where near 5 stars."
4,This curler makes nice bouncy curls out of stick straight hair,"I'm Asian and my hair will only hold a curl for a little while. After using this curler my curls were bouncy and lasted for a very long time. The curls looked very cute and peicey even after I ran my fingers through my hair. I didn't use any styling products to preserve my curls, just some biosilk. At first I didn't like that it didn't have a clip to hold the hair but this makes it so you don't get any kinks in your ends. This also means you will be using two hands to curl your hair. My arms were killing me when I used it. I accidently placed mine on a plastic bag and it melted onto the curler. When it cooled the plastic peeled off completely. The curler also has no on/off light which puzzled me because it is a basic feature on most curlers. I really do like this curler and wish I bought mine on Amazon for this price. I paid 117 for mine, grrr! So, if you've got hard to curl hair this curler is for you."
1,Total Garbage!,"Plan an simply, Amazon should not sell this product. It is obviously a very poor quality transfer from a TV broadcast. Dead Heads know how to do bootlegs, the chumps who did this do not! The picture quality is so bad that I only watched the first 5 minutes. I have never seen a DVD with this bad of picture quality before and, hopefully, never will again.I really want to see these flicks. Where can I get a version that is watchable?"
4,Highly Recommended!,This book can save you thousands of dollars in car reapairs!! It really can. I have no idea why it's being backordered. I think everyone should have a copy of this book as a reference material. (Gosh I sound like a cheesy commercial!)
5,Must see Blast from the Past.,"The Rat Pack made this movie worth owning. It's a fun film, if you like singing, dancing, and the rat pack you will like this movie. I don't like when people tell me all about what happens in a review, so I am trying to give you the basics and then you can make up your mind. I am very happy to add this to my collection."
4,Classic,"Peter Falk as ""Robbo"" Frank Sinatra as a Hood, throw in Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Bing Crosby and many Character actors that you love to see on your screen; what a wonderful mix for entertainment! I remember watching this in my youth and didn't want those memories to fade. Now they never will, it was just as enjoyable in 2009 as it was back in the 60's!"
5,Enjoyable,"I've always loved this movie - how can you miss when it's cast with the Rat Pack? Bing Crosby is hilarious as the snooty member of the crew; Peter Falk does a pre-Colombo, unsubtle gangster; and Frank, Dean and Sammy are their usual cool selves. It's a bit of fun, light entertainment and a funny take on the Robin Hood legend."
3,a good film done wrong on dvd,another warner brothers boo boo...a excellent movie musical with the rack pack...funny and memeorable songs...except the audio on the dvd is one channel...this is terrible...a movie musical in one channel...where is the surround or 5.1...warner bros is doing injustice to a good film...please all fans let warner know...also anyone knows what happend to a rat pack movie named sergeants three...made in the sixties...i cannot locate anywhere...
3,Rat Pack Finale,"Frank, Dean and Sammy go gangster in the Rat Pack's most satisfying film. Breezily directed by Gordon Douglas, ""Robin and the 7 Hoods"" (1964) features a colorful supporting cast and the Sinatra standard ""My Kind of Town."" The musical-comedy is notable for the only cinematic collaboration between Sinatra, Martin and Bing Crosby - who memorably croon their way through ""Style."" Meanwhile, Davis gets to strut his stuff with the incredible ""Bang! Bang!"" number. Despite its overlength and disappointingly abrupt conclusion, the Rat Pack's final big-screen epic remains preferable to the self-indulgence of ""Ocean's 11"" and ""Sergeants 3."""
2,DON'T LET THIS UNMEMORABLE MUSICAL HOOD WINK YOU,"This musical mix of murder and misadventures between rival crime gangs is agreeable and serviceable. And not very memorable. Frankie isn't acting (give Peter Falk that credit), andit's nice to see the Rat Pack teeming (or is that ""teaming""?) again. Even Der Bingle makes a welcome appearance. The highlight is as vulgar as it is mind-numbing: Sammy Davis Jr.'s rat-a-tat-tatting number in which he dances with various guns, blowing away this and that and offering Sammy Cahn-Jimmy Van Heusen's genius as proof that musical numbers can sometimes silence an audience, if only until their jaws lock back in place. There's a different Chicago that's my kind of town .. and all that jazz!"
1,It must be me.,"I finally watched this movie over a friends house. He loved it. I thought it was trast. Plain and simple.I have never liked Frank Sinatra for personal reasons. (if i put them in my review, i'm sure this won't be printed) Dean Martin and Sammy Davis i never really thought as movie stars but more like nightclub entertainers. I respect their work but like all the other Rat Pack movies, this one sucks also.To me, it was just a stupid movie that made no sense, has no value and doesn't contribute anything to the movie musical. So i'm sure i am the minority on this and i better not say anything except that if your looking for one of those block-buster musicals, this is NOT the film for you."
1,Too Much Smoking and Drinking!,"It's a dumb movie, dumb story and I didn't think it was funny! What's going on with Sammy Davis's eye?"
4,Robin and the Seven Hoods,These actors must have had a great time making this movie. They all work so well together. Love listening to the old songs my dad enjoyed so much. Surely brings back a lot of memories.
3,My kind of town,"If you are a fan of the ""rat pack"" you will find some enjoyment. The story line isn't fantastic, but listening to Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. and Bing Crosby is fantastic. Peter Falk made a good pre-Columbo opponent as well. Enjoy..."
3,Off to a very slow start... but improves,"Not long before this started shooting, there was a major rift in the rat pack, and because of that, only three members (Martin, Davis, and Sinatra, of course) show up here. The other two roles were filled in, and quite ably, by Peter Falk and Bing Crosby. And if you like rat pack-style music, having ensemble numbers with Frank, Dean, and Bing is something you're gonna love.The last half of this movie is good. It ain't Oceans Eleven, but it's good. Too bad the first half moves slower than a snail on ludes. Crosby doesn't show up until an hour into the film, and the action starts right there; before that, what the movie needs most is an editor who isn't afraid of Sinatra. It does, however, have some fine music (Sinatra debuted ""My Kind of Town"" here), and once it picks up, it's a lot of fun. Watch it when it comes on AMC, but spend the first half hour or so going to the store to get munchies."
5,Robin and the Seven Hoods,Great movie for those who like to watch the old flicks!!! Very enjoyable. I would recommend everybody purchase this product.
2,Dated and Dull,"The central idea of this movie is the activities a 1920's Robin Hood and his band of gangsters. Unfortunately, even the Rat Pack cannot save this movie. The script is slow, dated,and dull. Barbara Rush's scenes are especially confusing. Her scenes almost seem to be part of a different movie. Nothing comes of her apparent interest in Sinatra or Martin which makes me wonder why they made the final cut. The main actors seemed to be bored, and with the exceptions of Bing Crosby and Peter Falk, walked through their performances. (Maybe they were hung over most of the time?)Save your money and borrow it from your local library."
3,The Rat Pack's best,"Since the most important members of the Rat Pack were, first and foremost, singers, it's not surprising that their best film (and final one, as well) is this musical. Frank, Dean, and Sammy all get their turns in the spotlight, and even Der Bingle has a piece of the action. Throw in an amusing pre-Columbo Peter Falk, and even an appearance by Edward G. Robinson, and you have a lively and very entertaining spoof of gangster films."
2,A few excellent cuts but mostly boring,"I collect instrumental surf CDs and have a very broad context within which to place the songs on this disk. The two songs by the Coffin Daggers are expressive, energetic, ironically humorous, beautifully played, and lovely sounding. They are thick with gorgeous guitar distortion. The rest of the songs are not in the same league, and sound like simplistic garage rock. It makes more sense to get a Coffin Daggers CD. Even the Volcanos (whose own two CDs are sparkling and exciting) sound boring here in a rip-off of the old standard ""Church Key"" they call ""Bad News."" I have listened to this CD several dozen times and the bad vibes have grown strong. Several collections that are much better and I still enjoy after many many hearings are ""Bikini World,"" ""Swivelin' Wahini"" ""Surfs Up"" and ""Beyond the Beach."""
5,Durable and entertaining,"I've had this bell toy for about 4 years. My parakeet loved to pull the beads and ring the bell with his beak and feet. My three cockatiels also quite enjoy it. One of them plays with it quite aggressively,but it's still in great shape. It's not a particularly complex toy, but it's been lots of fun for my little flock."
4,Vaughan Williams,Vaughan Williams: Serenade to Music; The Lark Ascending; Fantasia on Greensleeves; English Folk Song Suite; In the Fen Country; Norfolk Rhapsody No. 1While this is a re-issue of a 1969 recording it is an excellent presentation by conductor Sir. Adrian Boult.
2,VAUGHAM WILLIAMS--VARIOS,"LAMENTABLEMENTE, YO COMPRE ESTE DISCO COMO USADO, NO COMO RAYADO. MI PRINCIPAL INTERESERA LA ""ENGLISH FOLK SONG"". ALLI ESTA EL PRINCIPAL DEFECTO. SI ES QUE ESTA REVISADO, COMO DICEN, NO DEBERIAN VENDER MATERIAL EN TAL MAL ESTADO."
3,Voughn Williams Lark Acending,Not quite what I expected and not as good as I had hopped for.My Fault - not theirs
1,Be careful,"After riding about 15 miles, on the Inline Thorn Resistant 26"" x 1.75/2.0 tube, on dry pavement, climbing a hil, the valve separated from the tube. I emailed Niagra Bikes about the problem, and received no response from them. I have decided to take my business elsewhere."
2,"Good ending, but not a good story.","This book was just boreing and did not catch my attention for the first 21 chapters, so I thought I would never finish it. Then when I got to chapter 22, my attention was finally caught and I finished it a week later.I do agree that there was way too much rambeling throughout the book. Also it seemed like the aurther was trying to rush the last pages and then there was not enough description. I didn't enjoy the last 5 pages because of that and I felt the story should have ended just a little bit differently.The ending over all was good, but the rest of the story just ruined that."
2,Rambling Alice,"I found the book interesting..but weak in content. I can't compare Alice to Ann (whom I've never read) so have an unbiased outlook. I enjoyed most of the historical material; but didn't appreciate how they were all put together. The thing I found most disturbing was the page stretching...there was so much rambling I'm afraid I had to skip a lot of it from boredom. Sometimes I even had to reread a page to figure out where the subjects were. I'm sorry...I loved the idea and the subject matter, but this was not the enjoyable read I had hoped for."
2,"The book, though interesting, was not very well written.","The Silver Wolf was not as good as I thought it was going to be. The beginning seemed to be very dragged out, and because of this the end appeared to be somewhat rushed. None of Alice Borchardt's characters were very well developed at all, and the some of the grammar was very poor. I would not recommend this book;although it was interesting and had a great story line, it was poorly developed. However this is just my opinion."
1,The Silver Wolf,"DREADFUL, DREADFUL, DREADFUL. I have never seen such a badly-written load of pap in my entire life. This reads like the worst of amateur fiction. The author has no regard or talent for the art of writing whatsoever. If I had not been on holiday in a non-English-speaking country, and unable to find a single other book at all, I would not even have bothered to finish. I do not recommend this ""story"" to anyone with any regard at all for quality literature. Anne Rice's gushing comments on the cover can be, I think, disregarded."
2,"Good story, often clumsy writing","""Captain Exposition!!!"" works overtime in this historical romance/fantasy from Anne Rice's older sister, with characters endlessly rattling on about the back story and history of the characters. Honestly, I've never seen back story so ineptly handled. That Borchardt's editor let it slip past only shows how helpful it is to have a powerful relative in the publishing world.But once the establishing chapters end, the books winds up as a pretty fair piece of historical fantasy. The premise drew my attention to it in the first place: a female werewolf in eighth century Rome caught in the political struggle between the Pope, Charlemagne, and the Lombards. Borchardt writes the werewolf action and expeditions into the spirit world with flair, but often dwells on historical digressions for too long, losing the plot momentum. The story moves in fitful spurts of action and historical scene setting, and would have been a far better work at half the length."
4,History & the Supernatural -- A Good Combination,"I recently came across the third book in this series and decided to start with this one, the first. It's a great read for those who enjoy history, romance, and intrigue. I especially enjoyed the strong female characters and the supernatural twists. The herione of the novel becomes more and more interesting with each turn of the page. And, the ultimate hero has some surprises of his own! I can hardly wait to start the second book and pick up where I left off."
2,Still looking for a good werewolf novel,"I didn't buy this book because of the author or who she was related to, but because I resently bought another werewolf book, Moon Dance, and it was a bummer. I was hopeing this would be good, since I am really into werewolves, but at last I found it wasn't. I don't which was worse, Moon Dance or The Silver Wolf. I just hope someone writes a great werewolf book someday."
4,"Good story, grammatical fail.","I enjoyed the story; the descriptions are thick and rich, the plot amuses me, and it's just a good view of werewolves. That being said, there are enough hanging dependent clauses to lynch a small country. I wish Borchardt had had a better editor, because this book would have been FANTASTIC if it weren't for the poor grammar."
3,It was alright,"I expected more when I picked it up, but it wasn't too bad. Some scenes I didn't think were very necessary because they caused the book to be more in the adult category. If not for those scenes, I may have given the book 4 stars.Overall, it's interesting and more original that the usual werewolf books, but no big loss if you don't read it.ShatteredCrystalChalice"
1,ZERO STARS!!,"It's a shame that you can't pick zero stars from the menu -- one was the lowest I could give. This book was terrible -- the plot was weak, the history shoddily researched, and the characters were cardboard and completely unappealing. Even the author's attempt at homo-erotica in the book fell flat -- apparently she was trying to cash in on her sister's writing style. Not a very good book -- and it's a little sleazy to have Anne Rice give a wonderful review of the book (she's the author's sister!) -- apparently Anne never actually read Silver Wolf. Just terrible!!"
1,I felt like I was watching a bad movie,"really uneven. basically a bodice-ripper romance novel trying to pass itself off as fine literature (I guess being pretentious runs in the family) -- sorry to be so harsh, the author must havwe put a lot of work into it, because the book weighs like 5 pounds.There were a couple of things I liked about Silver Wolf, but they were pretty well outweighed by the author going on ad nauseum about the heroine's pert breasts and magical silver hair.It is just not my cup of tea, personally. Give me Marion Zimmer Bradley or even Stephen King over this."
3,Not What I Expected...,"The Silver Wolf wasn't at all what I had hoped. While I give it 3-stars, that's only because it was a good read. If I had it to do over I wouldn't have read it at all. Nothing in the story really *grips* you and, though the description is wonderful. I suppose there's a plot under there somewhere, but it's never really brought to light and the whole book seems to roll along, slowly and dragging in many places, then the end isn't really worth the read. If you happen to see it at the library and have nothing better to do then I'd say pick it up for something to pass time, but I wouldn't go out and spend money on this book, it's simply not worth it."
4,A Cute Little Book,"A friend who gave me this book called it ""a cute little book,"" and while he wasn't trying to stop me from reading it, he almost did. And he was right, but in the best way he could be. This is indeed a ""cute, little"" book, being both short (just over 100 pages) and cute (meaning light-hearted and funny). It's a sweet urban love story that is both surprisingly clever and unexpectedly poignant. More than anything else, though, this is a wildly funny and inventive little book that you'll want to recommend to both your friends and enemies, superheroes or not."
1,Disappointing,"Badfinger was never a group that could coast on their talent. While Ham and Molland could pen some great songs, they were few and far between, and some of the recording techniques were what made some marginal songs great. This CD is evidence that not all songs that Ham wrote were gems. The result here is very uneven and the sound quality is poor. Yes, we know it was recorded on a a reel-to-reel as demos, but with the technology available today, much more could have been done to make update the quality. Sorry, it wasn't up to standards, and I'm sure Pete would have been embarrassed by its release."
2,Does NOT work with compact fluorescent lights!,"Anything that uses an electronic ballast (light the compact fluorescent lights - CFLs) will not work with this device. That's because the device looks at the peak current to figure out the watts. For example, a CFL that actually uses 13 or 14 watts will erroneously show up as using 65 watts. That's because the crappy meter sees a maximum of 0.5 amps of current, but most of the time the CFL is drawing much less current. This device only refreshes about twice a second and cannot see a current that is pulsed faster than that. It will work fine for anything that uses a constant level of current, like a fan, toaster, etc. Also keep in mind that the packaging itself says it is only accurate from 125 - 1875 watts. That means anything using less that 125 watts might not show up very accurate. There are much better devices out there, like the Kill-a-Watt."
5,DON'T LET MY HOUSE BURN,"My house almost caught fire while I was on vacation.I had too many electrical appliances on one circuit . luckily, my best bud stopped over to feed my cats & saw the house was full of smoke.He carefully looked for the source & saw a plug smoking which burst into flame as he watched.He unplugged the source cord, opened the windows and saved my home from burning down.I thought the fuse on the power cord would protect me....WRONG !With this tester I have kept the amps down to a safe level on each of my outlets.....This tester should be in everyone's home...IT REALLY WORKS !Very simple to use.I give it 5 stars !"
2,Not recommended.,"I have two problems with this tool:1. When I have the selector on ""Amps"" the last digit is supposed to be a decimal. So where is the dot then?! E.g. the display shows 37 instead of 3.7 (you wouldn't want to have 37A running through your circuits at home, trust me). Perhaps I just have a bad one, but I doubt it because LCD segments don't normally burn like LED segments.2. The display is updated too often jumping from one value to the other all the time. It's really annoying. The refresh rate should be longer, e.g. every 2-4 seconds. This is a design flaw done by people who probably did not understand well what AC is.I was going to buy a Reliance transfer switch for my generator but in view of the poor quality of their tools I'll buy another brand."
3,Reliance THP103 AmWatt Load Tester,Seems to be close in watts (60w light bulb shows 59w) but shows 330 Amps on a 550 Amp blender.
4,good tool,Very handy to have when checking/testing load on individual components. Works well for testing capability of portable generators. Very easy to use.
5,Great Item,The item works as described and was/is very helpful for testing the drain on my motor home generator!
1,151 piece tool set,"These tools are made in China. I also ordered a 246 piece tool set, which is made in Taiwan. The Taiwan tools are ok, the Chinese tools are defective. The 1/4 ratchet did not work at all. I sent them back. I also have 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2 inch Proto socket sets made by Stanley in the USA. They are great, and well worth the extra money. You will not be happy with the Chinese junk!!!!!!!"
4,"Soulful, Spirited, & Energizing!","I heard one track and was hooked. This album/CD is loaded with entrancing blends of beats, chants / raps (English and non-English), grooves that will make you want to move your body -- whether you choose to or not. The track ""Get Up"" makes you do just that. It is a great example of the many energetic compositions. This volume definitely has heavy Indian influences - the traditional instruments blend perfectly with modern electric dance beats. Get this album if you enjoy an exotic blend of the mid-Eastern tradition with European club grooves. You will not regret this purchase."
2,Meh.,"Not as good as the first Indestructible Beats, but then again, that's just wishful thinking. I find the tunes a bit derivative, and a little too ""poppy"" for me."
3,RCBS POWDER TRICKLER REVIEW,"I would of liked it better if it had a cheap plastic cover AT BOTH ENDS. One would keep the powder from spilling(if knocked over) and the other would ALLOW sand or some type of weights to be added for more stability. For the price you would of thought they could go a couple of asprin bottle caps, Perhaps next year, when the economy is better."
4,beautiful playing,"Karl Leister delivers a great performance of the clarinet concerto. His dark sound and amazing intonation and his ability to play with such easy is remarkable.The oboeist was not near the same level as Mr. Leister. Though he did have a good enterpretation I couldn't get past how unoboe like his sound is. I guess it's hard to find anyone nearly as good as alex klein.The bassoonist is a delight to listen to. This has to be one of the most relaxed entrepations of the concerto I have heard yet. Everything came out so naturally as if the concert were in the heart of the performer,I give this recording a 4 star rating, if the oboist had better tone I would have given it a 5 star."
3,Sobering instead of uplifting.,"As other reviewers mention, this book is a refreshing change from many self-help books on depression. The perspective is totally different, as the author is a sociologist instead of a health care professional. It reads more like a scholarly study than a self-help book.The book's realistic approach can be a little harsh for the unsuspecting reader. The author helped me to come to terms with the fact that depression is a long term condition, however, he did not give me much hope for living a better life. This book may help you find self-acceptance but it definitely won't cheer you up."
2,Depression,"This book contains a clinical look at depression. This book defines depression, symptoms, medications, etc. During the author's research, clinical trials were performed and the subject's responses are included in the reading. This book was a slow read and it was hard to identify with it."
2,Meisner is not for everyone,"I read this book in anticipation, hoping that he would inspire his actors. I found Meisner to be condescending and quite negative. Like another reader's review, I just couldn't finish the book. The impression I got from the book, is that Meisner is an emotionally, psychologically unstable person. He seemed to be a person who had serious problems and taking it out on his students. His technique may work for some. Personally, I have found ""other techniques"" more useful and helpful. I suggest ""The Chubbuck Technique"" by Ivana Chubbuck or ""How to Stop Acting"" by Harold Guskin."
1,Horrible,"Thank God that I bought this book at a very low price through one of the retailers. Because it was horrible. I only read about half-way through the book because it was very painful. I felt a lot of the infomation he taught was very repetitive. It all depends on what you want, I just didn't like his whole process and learning techniques, they were driving me nuts. But I never took a meisner-technique class. But I wonder, the only way this technique works if you have a partner. What if you're doing a one-man show, or practicing a monologue. I just know that I never got an emotional connection with this book. It was very painful as I said."
1,A Guide to the technique of acting,"Sanford Meisner's ""On Acting"" is an excellent book for the actor. This book can benefit someone new to acting as well as a individuals with acting experience. The book goes through each lesson from the beginning of his course and gives instructions for exercises to guide the actor toward a progression of more and more complex acting problems. Ultimately the goal here is to have his students understand how a sound technique can help them to experience a deeper level of expression. His method also guides the student work toward a more truthful and meaningful development of character ."
1,Awful,"I couldn't even finish this book. Meisner makes acting (acting school in this case) sound like an absolute nightmare!The book's setting is an acting school, where he is (supposedly) training students to be actors. Instead, he keeps letting students go despite their dedication to their craft, and deciding for them they just ""aren't cut out to be actors"".While I thought some of his insight on acting was helpful (living truthfully under given imaginary circumstances); I found the book negative, condescending, and discouraging. Awful, actually. There are much better books about acting."
2,Meisner's technique is not right for everyone.,"Of course, no single acting technique can be right for every aspiring performer, but I must say that I personally found Meisner's book to be condescending and ineffective. The author seems to subtract the most essential aspects of art from the process of creating a character: imagination, creativity, and humanity. These are the trademarks of my ""technique."" Like any art, performing is 2% inspiration and 98% perspiration. I am a good actor, but not because of this book. Hard work, dedication, practice, and sheer will power make an actor believable."
2,a sadist teaching people how to not live,"i couldn't finish this book. meisner's negative energy just got to me. now, i'll grant you, he's probably a great acting teacher, perhaps the best, but what is he really teaching people how to do? he says it's how to become deeply vulnerable, to really get to their core emotional stuff...but for what purpose? i just got a really bad feeling about this guy's energy, the feeling that he's a disturbed person acting out his own childhood traumas on his pupils, over whom he wields a huge amount of power through his authority.i thought to myself while reading this that if meisner is the best (and i wouldn't doubt that he is), i never want to become an actor.i'd rather just live my life...and when i do get to my emotional core issues, it's not to exploit them for better acting, but for my own personal growth...as a person."
5,Review - Sanford Meisner on Acting,"I had signed up for a short series of classes and completed the series utterly befuddled. It was not until I read this book that I realized that the instructor had been attempting to teach based on the principles of Meisner. This book is easy to read and flows logically from one concept to the next. The narrator takes you through a series of classes with Sanford Meisner - describing how he presented various exercises, his students' questions, their responses to the exercises and, finally, what Mr. Meisner was attempting to achieve through these exercises. The book provides you with an excellent overview of both the Meisner principles of acting, as well as an insight into the character of Mr. Meisner and what it would have been like to take a class with him. This book was not only informative; it was also...dare I say it..entertaining!"
5,Hey. It's better than Uta Hagen.,"i've been studying the Meisner Technique for two years now, and without this book I would be lost. Sandford Meisner's appraoch to acting has taken the craft in an entirely new and powerful direction. I recommend that every acting student get a hold of this book. It will change the way you look at acting forever."
4,Excellent introduction,"I am working with an acting coach who uses the Meisner method. She suggested I read this book as a primer and it is outstanding. Of course, you can't get the method simply by reading a book, but it is a wonderful basic introduction."
5,This is a must-have book for anyone serious about acting,"You will NOT read this book and come away a brilliant actor. Then again, no book can do that for you. You can only learn by doing, either in class or in a performance. With that in mind, this book is packed with incredible insights, some that are basic tips for the beginner, and others that will only be appreciated after years of performing and multiple readings. Sanford Meisner, one of the members of the famed Group Theatre in the 1920's, was one of American theatre's gems, and sitting in on a course of his, through this book, is the only way to capture some of that magic. A ""must-have"" for any serious actor's library."
4,Great reading for the actor,"Sandford Meisner on Acting is an intriguing book for the actor whether you are currently enrolled in class or if you just want to be inspired. The book is mostly compiled of verbatim notes from Sandy's class, so reading it you feel like you are auditing an acting class. Your craft is not necessarily going to improve just by reading, but I found his teachings and philosophy inspiring for sure. So it's worth the read. It's like the old saying (I think Jack Nicholson said), ""If it works, do it."" Good luck!"
5,meisner on acting,"this is an extremely helpful and insightful book, especially if you've already been exposed to meisner's technique. I don't know how helpful it would be if you haven't been in some meisner technique classes. But, as acting books go, this is one of the best I've ever read. It has detailed examinations of scene work by Meisner himself and includes some telling conversations with his assistant. If you want to see Meisner act you can rent the movie ""Mikey and Nicky"" starring John Cassavetes and Peter Falk. Meisner has a couple of scenes and, although he doesn't have much to do in the picture, it's fun to see these legendary teachers on film. If you read this and want some more exposure to this technique, Larry Silverberg has a series of books on the Meisner Technique. They're extremely in depth and informative with lots of exercises."
4,Hershey's Chocolate,"This is a great product; always has been and hopefully, always will be. It was delivered on time and fresh."
2,No puedo,La movie me llego broken por lo tanto no pude mirarla entonces no puedo opinar hacerca de la movie. tuve que regresar la movie. Para la siguiente mejor compro una nueva. Esque la anterior la compre usada.
3,Jury still out on this product,"Purchased it 3 weeks ago and have been using it ever since. Honestly, I don't see any improvements yet but it may be too soon."
4,Earthly Body Miracle Oil.,This was recommended to me to aid me in getting rid of a fungus on my toes. I think it really helped.
4,really miracle,"Nice oil, works well. It really moisturize the area that you would like to work on. I would definatley order it again."
4,Funny and thoughtful,"Gore Vidal is one of my favourite USA writers, because we share some ideas, which is logical and it explains why he lives in Europe, USA is very rightish this years...But it is a country where critics to the system could be thought and published (think of Chomsky, for instance), and that's good, although I'm not sure if Gore Vidal has got many readers in his own country. Anyway, he talks about sexuallity in USA, specially homosexuality, with a high sense of humour -very entertaining, indeed. And listen, the idea that there're not ""gays"" and ""straights"" is not his, you can also read it in Marvin Harris books: our Western society is the only one that qualifies somebody because of his/her sexual tendencies."
2,PBS presents a one dimensional portrayal,Pbs provides a very one dimensional view of a complex man to say the least. Without Lee's leadership and calming actions after his surrender the country would have experienced a continueing cival war for decades. Nothing was mentioned of his refusal of financial gain or his constant calming effects on his former officers and troops. I would expect a more balanced portrayal from PBS.....but I guess they have lost their perspective.
1,Disillussioned PBS Viewer,"From the opening words of this biography, as the reader in solemn tones recited Lee's Oath of Allegiance upon accepting his military commission, it was transparent that the film sought to besmirch the man. I by no means am an expert on the Civil War, but I have read a few serious books on the subject. Those accounts bear no resemblance to the tripe presented in this biased, politicized ""documentary."" Ironically, PBS has inspired me to read definitive biographies on Lee written by true historians interested in truth rather than their own political views."
1,Extreme negative bias,"There was a lot of revisionist ""history"" here. The picture painted of Lee is very unfair.Lee was forced to choose whether to remain loyal to his state or his country. He chose his state. This does not make him a traitor.Lee faced insurmountable odds, yet nearly overcame them.I think that it is a travesty that some people will form an opinion of Lee based on this ""biography""."
1,A Biased Negative Biography,"The makers of this historical documentary clearly set out to discredit the life of Robert E. Lee due to the fact that he sided with the South. Every discussion and interpretation of the events in his life were given a negative slant. Clearly the editors carefully picked and chose only those comments the several historians gave in their interveiws that would shine a negative light on Lee. I was truly amazed at the never ending ""punches and blows"" to his reputation that continued non-stop throughout the film. As a long time student of the Civil War, and as a 36 year History teacher, I know that Lee was not a perfect ""marble man."" But, this ""hatchet job"" on Lee can easily be seen as nothing more than a revisionist PBS attempt to take Lee down as a great American historical figure. Although the film's presentation style, and early photographs are well done, I cannot recommend this film to anyone interested in the life of Robert E. Lee."
5,Dictionary of AK Place Names,The book arrived well packed and in beautiful condition - totally happy with all aspects of this order
1,Very disappointed,"Just received my package of 2 Alfred Sung Men's EDT 3.4 ounce. One was Okay... and the other was empty, no cap, and the box was damaged. How do I return this very disappointing shipment?"
5,My Favorite Cologne Ever,This is my go to men's fragrance. It is the perfect combination of cool fresh scent and warm scent. It is very refreshing but not too dull and forgettable. Plus it's not overly used like Coolwater or Aqua di Gio so you won't run into anyone else wearing it too often. I get people asking me what cologne I'm wearing from time to time because they love it and have never smelled anything like it.
1,POS. Don't buy it.,"The synthetic smell gives me nothing but headaches. Not only that, it does not last. I am only keeping the bottle because it is so unique looking. Never again."
4,truly...paradise,"Nice, fresh, clean scent that's perfect for any occasion. Good price; excellent value for money...this means I'll be coming back!"
4,Easy install and looks good,"I received the grips when expected, everything was in good shape. The install was easy, I decided to use different glue based on what I had read as to how fast the glue that comes with it dries. I used gorilla glue, just be careful and don’t use too much on the throttle side as the glue does expand. I would purchase from this seller again."
4,THIS CD MAKES ME LAUGH,"THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CDS I OWN! IT'S NOT QUITE LUST OR OUR LITTLE SECRET BUT IT IS STILL GOOD. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE ""AM I SEXY?"" ""LOVER (CAKE MIX)"" ""ROUGH SEX (ALL NIGHT GRINDER MIX)"" ""CRABLOUSE (SUPER SCRATCHER WITH A GOLDEN SHOWER RAINBOW MIX) BOTH ""I SIT ON ACIDS"" ""SPANK MY BOOTIE (PADDLES AND WHIPPED CREAM MIX)"" AND ""RUBBER DOLL (PUKER UP SWEETIE AND BLOW ME UP GENTLY MIX)"""
3,"Get ""Voodoo-U"" instead","I was really expecting for this to be a good CD, but....it wasn't. It's got a few good tracks on it, but overall, find one of your sucker friends who bought it already and copy the good tracks."
2,Lords of dissapointment???????,"I bought this c.d not knowing it was mainly remixes. I gave it a try though. The further into it I got the more disappointed I got. I felt the new songs lacked the lords of acid energy. As for the remixes out of the bunch there where only a couple that stood out, and even these were no wear near as good as the originals. If you like remixes then this is the album for you. If your looking for the signature lords of acid sound I suggest you listen to their old albums until they release their next full length album"
4,Decent Remix album,"As far as remix albums go, this one is decent. I love the Lords of Acid, and was a little disappointed to find out that this was not all original music. But these days, you get what you can get. If you haven't listened to LOA before, go get Lust and get hooked by that. Then you'll be able to appreciate this more."
3,remixing the mixed up,"This is a decent remix album, not the greatest but O.K. Some of the mixes you can find on the singles, but all in all it's good. Try not to pay more than $10 for it though. It's a nice little dance album but nothing too special. The bonus track at the end though( a cover of ""Lady Marmalade"") is pretty cool."
3,Blah.. nothing new really...,"The new tracks are pretty good, and a few of the remixes are cool, but it seems they just keep remixing the same old songs, which gets old. I like the orginals better, to be honest. But a few of the remixes are quite amusing, but don't expect anything to make u go: HELL YEAH!"
5,A great winter movie,We have this movie in tape -I purchased from video store closing. I wanted it in DVD for better viewing. This is one of our favorites and a watch every winter when the snow is falling and cold outside. A wonderful family movie Kurt Russell's best movie. If you have not seen - you need to!
4,Do you love mountains in the fall?,I really enjoyed this movie. Its setting in the mountains during the early 30's was quite entertaining. It's sort of like a 20th century version of red badge of courage. I would recommend it.
3,It's Okay!,Great part of the country to see!Great cast!One of my favorite time periods!But the movie seemed to move soooooo slow!I never finished it!After reading the reviews maybe I'll try to hang in past the first 40 minutes and it'll get better?
5,Kings of Progressive Electronica,"Just when I was getting used to how good the Inferno album was, I found a copy of View From a Throne. The title track pretty much blew me away. I actually can't find a bad track on it. I really like the way they released Inferno as an album but with the singles being their own mini-albums. All together it is like one big double album. I have noticed that they have been doing more German-sung tracks than in the past. The cool thing is, you are so wrapped up in the depth of the music that sometimes you don't even really notice. If you like Inferno, than I would very strongly recommend that you pick up both this and the other single, Trialog. Between the three releases, I think that this is easily some of the best material the band has ever written. It takes all the strengths from past albums and pushes it to a new level. This fan is impressed."
4,I'll never look at a strand of pearls the same way again!,"All stories were interesting in their own way-each author with their own style of erotic romance. Though very little about each story was realistic, you won't be dissapointed if you want a little tantalizing easy reading."
3,Disapointed,"Only the third story is other than almost pure pornography, the caracters have no life and the relationship stinks between them, the end - mariage - does not justify to put anything in a romantic erotism book. I did not even find it erotic, the tension is not there, I did not root for any of the caracters at almost any time. I do like - a lot - romantic erotism when it is well done, this was not the case with this book, and I think the first story was already published."
3,"Sorry, McKenna!","Foster and Denison stories were great and expected, but McKenna? Ugh. It was one of the worst I have ever read and it didn't belong with the other two. I don't think I'll ever read anything from her again."
3,I wanted it for kitchen use,"I was kinda of disappointed, the hook was way to big, for in the kitchen, I will give one to my son-in-law and the other to my son for xmas.. wish I could find on with a smaller hook."
3,turning fork,"we bought 2 of these for our grills.they are a great idea, but we were surpised at how large they are. we thought they would be smaller & sharper.they do make turning ribs,steak & chicken very easy."
3,2 stars or 5 stars (3 1/2 stars),"As a lacquer, varnish remover I used it on some wood from the '20s. It worked fairly well but not as advertised. I also used it on some japanning (on a old plane), its the only thing I have found that will remove it, although it didn't work as described but still 5 stars.The good:Will work but needs to be 70F+.Needs a couple hours.The Bad:Can't be brushed on.Dissolves many plastics including foam brushes.Difficult to clean up although MS helps.Gets thicker and can dry on exposure to air.Pretty much need to immerse the object.Some work with a wire brush is necessary.The ugly:Appearance and consistency out of the can are like snot (that's why it can't be brushed on).When it is exposed to air it starts bubbling, when that slows it's spent and needs to be removed and fresh applied.Will generally ruin any brush it is used with.Generally a very messy product that IMHO is pretty specialized. BTW does not work on shellac or two part epoxy paint."
1,Worthless. Didn't budge paint,"I bought this. not form Amazon but from one of those well known big box Home repair stores. if i could give it zero stars i would. I was using it to strip guitar paint. This was not up to the job. i made two attemps. followed the instructions. it says it will work in 15 minutes. put a thick layer on and after 35 minutes nothing budged. And i've already sanded layers off. On the second attempt i put a massively thick layer on and left it for two hours. Not even a single spec of paint came off when scraping. it didn't bubble, or curl one drop. my saliva would have done more damage. I'd wouldn't get close to this stuff."
5,Excellent on Buttermilk Cornbread!,"The Lavender taste is not over whelming. I went to a restaurant in Portland a number of years ago and we had cornbread in a skillet and what made it outstanding was the Lavender Honey... now of course this particular honey was from the local growers but I purchased this one when I returned made a batch of Buttermilk Rosemary cornbread and poured this on it just before taking it out of the oven it was DIVINE. It does crystallize so be aware of this, easy remedy is to place on top of stove near the heat and it will return to it's regular consistency.Respectfully Reviewed"
2,Um....It's OK.,"I mean,It's OK.Becuz I used to like her.But now,I think she's ok.Not as good as I thought."
5,perfect!,Great! Exactly the book i have been looking for and it came in a timely manner. thanks so much!
4,"Good book with a predictable, yet happy ending","This book is about a boy who lives at a children's home. He's been there the longest, and he thinks that he's homely, and he doesn't think he'll ever get out of there. He finds a dog one day, and attempts to keep him, but the man who painted the house took him home so that eddie wouldn't get in trouble, because one of the people who takes care of the children is allergic to dogs. If you want to find out more, you have to read the book, and the ending is awesome."
2,"If you like Karajan, this is for you. If not...","Karajan has a tendency to conduct every symphony as if it were Beethoven's 9th -- the music must start almost inaudibly like a faint hum and (very) gradually take shape and emerge. While this approach is effective for, say, Bruckner symphonies, it does not work very well for the New World Symphony. This particular recording of the piece takes an extremely long time to get off the ground -- when the low strings make their entrance, going back and forth between the brasses, the orchestra sounds like it's swimming in molasses.The Eighth Symphony is done better, though almost by necessity; the music just happens to be bouncier than the Ninth, so there's less room for excessive rubato."
1,Dissappointing Dvorak,"Unfortunately, all of Karajan's efforts have failed to bring out the best in two of Dvorak's most beautiful compositions. The poor orchestral balance (or was it the poor recording process in this case) made for a totally un-enjoyable listening session. One star is too generous."
3,More about the researchers,Was a little disappointing but still entertaining. More about the researchers than about the wolverine. I just hope the guy in Alaska shows as much time and dedication to his son as he does the wolverines.
3,Good Beginning!,"This book is good for a class warmup. It probably could benefit from more indepth questions or more complex examples built on thebasic ones in the book, but it is very easy for the students tocomprehend. It might be a bit too basic for anything more thangrade level classes. The questions and answers are very obviousfor my Pre Ap students. I think it is a very good start!"
5,A marvellous little book,"This is a terrific story of courage and hope. Of endurance and determination. It's the story of the Jews who arrived in what is now Israel during the period of the British Mandate. The book continues through the end of the Israeli War of Independence at the start of 1949. There are numerous substantial quotes from many of those who reached the Promised Land, as well as several pages of photographs. For anyone interested in the history of Israel, this is simply a superb work, and Ben Wicks is to be congratulated for writing it."
5,Amazing.,I'm a book work but only for teen books with some type of romance in it. This book was captivating and I could not put it down. I cried and the main character was so unfortunate. It made me want to reach into the book and hug her for being so unlucky...
1,easily destructible,My small amazon parrot bit through the plastic (rubber) string that holds the whole thing together in less than 1 minute!!!! Not recommended unless you want only toy parts.
1,wrong product sent,I order for t-520 printor cartridge and receive t-630 cartridge.I sent request to send back and nothing heard from anybody.bad service and bad products .
3,dual caller ID,"Good value for the money. You need to be within 10 feet to hear. It has a weak microphone and weak speaker. I have a Mainstreet Messenger phone that is way better can hear and speak 20'away, but cost much more. This one works fine but you have to be close. You get what you pay for. If you have a large house I would recommend getting two."
4,Great psuedo history lesson,The book is psuedo history on events based on the roman invasion of Ireland. In usual Llywelyn style we follow one character from early childhood to death - which brings satifaction to the reader.This is one of those rare books that is a page turner.
2,exciting?????,"i'm dissapointed! i was looking for a book like tolkien's, were magic flows at every page. it was very hard for me to finish the book, because i knew how it would end. and that's because i've read 'asterix and the chieftain's shield' and other asterix adventures, and, believe me, it was funnier."
1,Disappointed,I read the reviews about this book and was excited to receive my book and start the read. I enjoy the history and myths of Ireland and Scotland and thought this would be right up my alley. I found the book to be very average.
5,Truly magical and memorable,"Easily the best work of Morgan Llywelyn's so far. I am studying the history of this novel and it is strikingly accurate and well-researched; however, Llywelyn still brings out the passion and imagination of the ancient Celts. It's certainly one of my favorite books of all time."
3,"Not terrible, not wonderful","I picked this book up because I had enjoyed some of her other books. However, this book was a struggle. I ended up skipping over a lot of the battle scenes just so that I could get through it.Ainvar is an orphan who is taken in by the chief Druid and instructed in their ways. His friend, Rix, is a warrior. Throughout their lives, they are the opposite sides of the same coin. Ainvar comes to give Rix advice throughout the book.This is a story of the conquering of Gaul by Caesar, and the decline of the Druids. I like Ainvar for the most part, but there were times where he was just a little too whiny. The women's roles in this book are varied. Some of them seem strong to begin with, but then they change. By the end of the book, you are just hoping that things don't end too depressingly.I am glad I didn't buy this book & only got it from the library. It was good, but probably not worth the money."
5,Great historical fiction,"This is the only book I have ever read from the perspective of the defeated Gauls. The clash of cultures is vividly portrayed by contrasting the mechanical Romans, with their square camps and uniformity, to the nature loving Druids and semi-disorganized warriors.The book was thrilling and brought alive the events from history. It is one of the best historical novels I have ever read!"
4,excellent couldn't put down,"I haven't read a book i guess in 20+ years (that is for enjoyment) I read this cover to cover in a few days last book i did that with was the Firestarter of Stephen King this is good the only reason i gave it a 4 star was the ending is a bit sad but it is history if it was about the Romans it would have been happy. But that is History and it history is cruel I hope we learn from it. Morgan Llywleyn has an easy clear way of writing that keeps the story flowing and moving. The story is very believable and I learned alot about the era, the phylosophy and the people. I felt I had lived and experienced their time. I've purchase a couple more of her books"
5,Fantastic!!,"I really enjoyed everything this book has to offer. The only fault I find is that it is quite long in getting to the inevitable downfall of the druidical society of Gauls and says very little about how they end up escaping. Other than that, this is a wonderful novel!"
3,Oster Blade size 1.5,"The quality of the Blade was great but it is definitely on the expensive side and unfortunately for me I needed to get a size between a #1 and #2 so I purchased this one thinking it would be the right size, however; it was not and I ended up having to purchase the size 1A which was perfect."
2,"Entertaining as Fiction, repulsive as nonfiction.","If one takes this work as fictional approach to secret societies and intrigue therein, then the book is entertaining. BUT this individual wants us to take his work as a piece of non-fiction. Luckily (if this is truly non-fiction) I read this so that I now I know for sure than no woman of any intelligence would want to follow this man. I give two stars just for the look into his belief of secret society workings."
1,Been there. Done that. Read with caution.,"I read the book in 1969 and became involved with the Stelle Group for the next five years--until the author/leader was exposed as a regular human of questionable integrity; was expelled; and went off to start his Adelphi project in Texas. The Great White Brotherhood stories presented in the book were allegedly learned by the author during his involvement with the same organization in Southern California that Elizabeth Clair Prophet sprang from. None of this material is new to anyone who has studied the esoteric traditions. Standard Masonic, Illuminati Grand Plan drama reading. Helpful, insightful, but of questionable relevance to the author and his projects. The author does a good job of casting himself as a significant player."
3,Second Pair Received Was Good,"The first paid of earrings I received were quite visibly blemished. The American Pearl website says ""American Pearl does not deal with blemished, marked pearls. Blemished pearls whose surfaces show imperfections or spots are worth half the value of perfectly clean pearls."" I find it unacceptable that they did not bother to inspect the pearls they sent to make sure they matched this standard.I had to pay to send the earrings back, and they returned to me a pair of good quality earrings. The customer service was good. But overall, it left me frustrated."
3,Kind of a clunky ghost story,"The scene where the guy is sitting inside a circle of turnips shaped like sculls with candles in them in a Halloween mask is worth the watching of this one ( supposed Druid ritual?). The ""crazy"" brother is almost over the top enough. The costuming of the lead leaves something to be desired.For me the romance between the lead and the younger brother should have had more tension or pathos ( something more?)? The spirit villain isn't really scary enough and the sleep walking lady isn't very convincing as a threat?For me this looks like a lot of first timer errorsin casting and costumes. For instance if the ghost had blood coming out his ears or something, it would have upped the tension level?The location was pretty good and the old houses were nice:actually more realistic than a lot of Hollywood products."
3,E book,This was a free e book. i used this as a source for a college paper. It was insightful and informative. I obtained several quotable pieces of data from this source. the searchable format makes evaluating a source so much easier than going to the library and digging through physical copies of books.
2,an oxymoron,"After reading Don's book ""Is There Life After HOusework?"" I was very excited to read more of his books. But to me this one was an oxymoron. The book seemed cluttered with reviewes. The reviewes may make one feel like they are not alone in the state of clutter that they live, but it was hard to find the tips on how to remove the clutter. Maybe check some of his other books on clutter first, then you might enjoy this one after you are clutter free."
5,Trying to find or buy a copy!,"I've been trying to find or buy a copy of this book for quite some time. If anyone has any info, please leave an email address on a review. Thanks."
4,CAR CLOTHES BAR,"STURDY BUT CLOTHES HAVE TO BE BALANCED ON EITHER SIDE EVENLY. HANGS ON THE TWO SINGLE CLOTHES CARRIER HOOKS ON BOTH SIDES IN BACK SEATOF THE CAR. IF YOU HAVE A CONVERTIBLE FORGET IT...THERE'S NO WHERE TO ATTACH IT. RUBBER SLEEVE KEEPS HANGERS FROM SLIDING. SO IF YOU WANT THEM TO SLIDE, IT'S NOT GOOD. ALL IN ALL FOR MY NEEDS IT WAS FINE."
4,Very good clothes bar,"well made with smart features (2 ways of hooking, rubber to stop hangars from sliding...) that make it effective"
3,Purchased for month long road trip,During our trip it fell off several times. A real pain to put it back up when we had clothes hanging on it.
5,reliable,I loaded this thing down with clothes moving from state to state and it is still very sturdy. Seems like it will last awhile...
5,Well Worth The Price,Totally happy with my clothes bar. It fit well in my vehicle and held more then enough clothes to make my trip.
3,Bell automotive clothes bar,works well only problem that the plastic ends break of very easily metal part is good it does what it is supposed do
4,Exactly what I wanted,"We travel alot and this is a study, attractive clothes bar. I am thinking about buying one for our second car."
2,not very heavy duty,"You could only put a few hangers on the bar before it would fall because of two much weight. The plastic ends are a bad design. If they were metal it could hold the weight. I decided to use rope to hold the bar up, it worked well for my cross country trip. The bar itself is extremely heavy duty, it's ashame the attachment ends are not."
1,Junk,The plastic clips hangers on the ends will not hold ten pounds of clothing. The clips bend straight when very little pressure is applied. Extremely poor design.
2,"Thorough book, but not enough practice on it","Although this book was very complete in its coverage of the program's features, it SERIOUSLY lacked many practical examples, tutorials, etc. It's one thing to read about the various features of Lotus Notes in this book, but it's much better in my opinion to actually practice them."
2,Not so great,"Burns just about everything. I had others in the family try it too, to make sure it wasn't just me, same results. As a toaster it's poor too, may return it."
2,items gets burnt,"I wanted a toaster oven to toast waffles, bread, etc. but this is more of an oven not a toaster. You have to guess on time for toasting most of my items gets burnt. I'm just disappointed in this product."
5,Classy,It's something I have not seen before and gives all the information people need to keep track of special days.
3,Birthday/Anniversary Book,"I""m disappointed with the book. It's not what I thought it would be. I'm keeping the book since I cannot find another."
2,Boring Bananas,"I bought this video for my 2 year old after recalling this popular series from the 90s. I didn't think this video held up with time at all; the show isn't educational and seems a bit empty (in content and set design) compared to today's children's programming. My son chuckled a few times at the bananas' silliness, but I am really glad we paid very little for this used video. I would recommend not bothering with this series."
5,The Lady Bird you thought you knew,"I thought I knew Lady Bird Johnson -- sweet, flat, uninteresting, dominated by her powerful husband -- until I read this outstandingly revelatory book. Bird is every bit as strong as Hillary, and probably even LBJ himself. Author Russell makes a convincing case that Bird is a force to be reckoned with, and I'm not talking about her party-planning skills. Superior biography that brings it subject to life."
3,"Nice Effort, but.....","As pertains to Lady Bird, the book is alright. Early in the book, however, the author makes a statement that in my mind caused me to wonder just a little if the rest of the book would be on target, that statement being as to Lyndon Johnson having ""given us Vietnam"". Unfortunate statement, as Vietnam was well underway before LBJ took the helm, even before Kennedy. If the author can't get THIS glaring fact straight, then how can I really trust the rest of the book? A better read, for those who care to dig deep and get facts, ""Flawed Giant: Lyndon Johnson and His TImes 1961 - 1973"" by Robert Dallek is a better picture, giving us the real Lady Bird, much better than Ms. Russell's work. Ms. Russell's book gives a good detail of Lady Bird's early life, but the Dallek book gives us the Lady Bird that means the most - what a great woman!"
1,Won't Work on Intel Mac,"Feral Interactive does list that Bionicle will not work on the Core Duo / Core 2 Duo. It was a little harder to ""find"" than I had hoped. But even with 2gb Ram and 256mb Video Ram, the game is unplayable.I am sure it's fun and works well on Power PC Mac's."
3,Beware Intel-Mac Users!,"It turns out this game does not play well on Intel-based Macs. We've got a 24"" iMac and it's a total wash out. It's a great game. But you'd better have a G5 to play it on."
1,"""The Movie Nobody Wanted,"" or ""They Made a Sequel to WHAT?!""","The only reason I gave this movie even ONE star is because there was no option for zero, or even better, ""negative stars."" (a little help here, Amazon?) Anyone who thinks ""The Whole Nine Yards"" deserved a sequel needs to seriously reconsider their taste in movies. No offense, but the original was a crapfest with the only redeeming quality being able to see what Bruce Willis looks like when he acts while asleep. And in both movies, Matthew Perry's spastic re-hashing of REALLY bad Jerry Lewis only highlights why the ""Luckiest L'il Hack"" should count his blessings that he was allowed to ham it up on ""Friends"" for the whole ten years. (...)""You might remember me as Matthew ""Chandler"" Perry... and could this mop BE any more absorbent...?"" (...) Buy ""Die Hard"" instead."
3,Falls short of the first,"I highly anticipated this sequel after laughing continually through The Whole Nine Yards. And while this movie does have some good chuckles (due to the neurotic comedic performance by Matthew Perry), the rest of the movie lacks the punch of the first. The scripting seems a bit shallow at times, and aside from Perry's performance, the other actors don't seem to be putting out the effort. Amanda Peet's character shines at points, but at other times seems lackluster. Since we've already been introduced to the characters in the first movie, the director attempts to throw off the viewer by introducing a plot twist - one which backfires by coming off as chaotic and cliche. I would recommend the movie for any die-hard The Whole Nine Yards fans, but unfortunately this isn't one for the collection."
2,"ten yards, but no first down...","I really enjoyed The Whole Nine Yards, but this sequel was a letdown, not to mention unnecessary in the first place. There's a few worthwhile moments, but overall the movie screams ""money grab"". The various head games Bruce Willis plays was funny in the original, but feels sorta recycled here. It might be worth checking out if you come across it while channel surfing, but otherwise you should probably save your cash for something else..."
5,A great movie,This movie was really good. The Whole Nine yards was an instant classic and now that i waited soo long fot this one. I'm glad it was good. Just as good as the first. I highly recomend that you buy it.
1,This movie was busted,"I am one to watch alot of movies and to be sort of pleased with all, but this movie was completely rediculous. i mean why would they make the movie this stupid. Granted the first one wasnt all that but this one was just thrown right into the theatres and no one was even thinkin bout the public's reaction to this movie. in all i dont recommend this movie to anyone. if it's on tv then im sure there is something else better on. dont waste your time like i did. tell everyone..this movie is Bulls***."
1,skb,Material in book is outdated. The ARRT has a registery for cardiac and one for vascular. This book contains both resulting in not many questions for the cardiac registery (or the vascular registery either).
3,Too much Hollywood gossip!,"All the information about origins and histories of names is wonderful-- both interesting and helpful. But the authors are too obsessed with what Hollywood celebrities are naming their kids, and all that gossipy fluff gets rather tiresome after awhile. Please-- take out the fluff, and use that space to give us a concise meaning for each name. THEN this book will truly be the only naming guide a prospective parent needs. And by the way, anyone who thinks Catherine Earnshaw was SAINTLY has obviously never read ""Wuthering Heights"" for herself."
1,Too judgmental,"For all of the intelligence the authors seem to have, it is a shame that their book is so incredibly biased about names. For instance: "" KERRY, a county in Ireland, but more importantly, a name for girls and sometimes for boys, though it shouldn't be. "" I want to know why this is so? Of course, it is based solely on the authors' opinions and as far as I'm concerned this book is far too judgmental. Find a nice open-minded book that will give you the background on names without throwing in personal feelings!"
1,The Last Word on First Names,"The authors possess a modicum of knowledge relative to the meaning of some names, but their presumption that they are in some ways arbiters of what qualifies as an ""attractive"" name is laughable. They authors judge that there are many ""far more attractive"" names than Vance for a boy, but Fred, Caleb, Barney, Moe, Angus, Mack and Tully fared just fine as reasonable choices.With all due respect to the Barneys, Moes and Freds of this world, I'm glad, as a Vance, that my parents did not read Satran's and Rosenkrantz's book. If it came down to these other choices or Vance, I'm happy to have settled for such an unattractive name."
1,"highly opinionated, subjective and invidious.","This is a supremely subjective, opinionated, gossip-driven mish mash on what the authors consider ""stylish"" ( to use their term)."
5,"havent read the book,only try to find out something.","i gess i try to make some fotstepps, dont kwow how to find a way to tell that i know now. gess i have to try more. Dont want to but, someone want's it. you can take this note away?"
4,Durable,"This toy is obviously very durable, compared to the cardboard items that come in many food sets. The orange juice is my kids favorite. Some of the other items are a little confusing for them - they are not really sure what to make with it (especially the waffle package)."
2,Too heavy for little hands,"My three year old enjoyed playing building blocks with these but they weren't practical for her kitchen. The articles were somewhat heavy with sharp corners. When they fell off her kitchen while she was playing, they became a problem when my baby was next to her."
5,"""Wood"" you find this food fun?","We LOVE Melissa & Doug products and this one in-particular has been our daughter's favorite! She's had this wooden food set for over a year and each one is in excellent condition. The wood and paint takes a beating, since she loves to put them in and out of her grocery basket, stack em', knock em' and re-stack em' over and over. They'll last forever and she knows each peice by heart. I hope to keep these for years, so her children can play with them as well. So much better than plastic!!"
5,A Lasting Set,"Thank you, Melissa and Doug! I am so tired of finding chewed up, crumpled, stepped on, paper, play food boxes. You spend $ on set of play food containers, only to see them destructed in no time at all. It's nice to finally have a quality product that will serve well as a dramatic play prop for young children. ""Melissa and Doug"" is quickly becoming my favorite, most-trusted brand of children's play items."
3,Good Food But Large Items,"My children enjoy this food set, as they are durable and realistic looking. However they also have the Melissa and Doug play food groups which I prefer, because the food items are a more manageable size for all ages. Some of the food items in this set (especially the cereal and pretzel box) are very large and heavy and I worry of children dropping them on their toes, etc. The age guide is 3 - 6 years which is a good guide, as they are fine for my 4 year old, but more of a concern with my 18 month old (who of course wants to play with everything the older one has)."
4,What creates success?,"It's a short and to the point book. A great read for those wanting to better define success for themselves.Mr. Bhatt takes a look at motivated people and helps us find our definition of success and how to achieve it. He focuses on several different levels of what we find successful about certain influential and/or inspirational people. Pros and Cons are described in detail about each group. In fact, he had me answering questions about my true beliefs of what success is. Attempting to achieve success without clearly knowing what it is you want is like running blindfolded. This book helps you take off the blindfold.Nirav creates an open door to positive, successful thoughts and questions that all people need to answer for themselves in order to find ""their success""."
4,Very well written and organized,"The content, and the organization of the content, of the book is good. I highly recommend this book to all who dream of being successful in anything and everything they do."
4,It's good,"This is a good book. The author avoids the self-indulgent aspects of most memoirs and has a great sense of humor. I think this is just as much a book about living in the south as it is about her grandmother. If you like pot liquor, you'll like this book."
4,Should be read by those with an interest in the Hmong,"Like all the books about the Hmong, there will be at times glaring inaccuracies and mistakes in the material, and Quincy has taken a lot of heat over the years for his attempts to help the Hmong reconstruct their history, most of which was lost during the 4,000 years between their roots in ancient China and the 20th century.Considered by most to be one of the less reliable texts to work from, I nevertheless found many interesting elements within it, that, when combined with additional research, yields some fine and fun reading.It should definitely not be taken on its own- one should try and double check statements by using other materials, but most people who read this will feel inspired to study and learn more about the Hmong and their true histories, and that's not such a bad thing."
1,"doesn't work well on Kindle, especially Kindle 2","On my Kindle, I don't know how to get beyond the introduction and to the poems. I do next page after next page and just get introduction. Pressing the joy stick right does nothing. There is a brief table of contents at the beginning, but Early Poems and Poems are not selectable. Of course, I can go to a high-numbered location, but I have no sensible way to choose the number. In addition, since the introduction was formatted for the Kindle DX, the lines run over on the Kindle 2.Of course if you know Hopkins, you can do a search on a word or two. The only word I knew to search for was ""dappled"". This led me to the poem I was looking for, and I enjoyed it and the next few poems. The poems fit on the page quite well.On reconsideration, I wanted to change my rating from one to three stars, but Amazon wouldn't let me."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the ugliest editions of any book I could imagine. It's laid out in bland, boring type. The paper and cover seem cheap, like it was made by the local print shop. Worst of all, the lay out of te poems is a disaster. Titles appear at the bottom of one page with the actual poem on the next. The last couple lines of a poem often dangle at the top of the next page - sometimes even requiring a turn of the page! - when there is plenty of open space all around, enough for the whole poem to sit in one place. It looks simple amateur. Like the format on Word isn't translate to the printers. Simple terrible. I'm returning my copy immediately.If this were the only copy of Hopkins poems, it'd be better still not to get it, since you couldn't help but think his poems as ugly as their dressing."
3,Why not in Stereo?,"I suppose I ought to have remembered what that saying that says, you get what you pay for.. this being a reasonabble price for a performance that's very good.. Well, playing it, it's been downgraded to Mono..that's unfortunate.. I k now for a factr it was recorded in stereo. By a stereo version if you encounter it."
4,One-Night Wife by Day Leclaire,"Description from the book back cover:Forgive and forget? Anna Kane wakes up in a hospital bed to find she can't even remember her own name. Luckily for her, her husband is there to remind her. The only problem is she can't remember him, either. Sebastian Kane is not a man who any woman could forget in a hurry. Anna soon comes to suspect Sebastian's description of their idyllic marriage is far from true. Why, for instance, has Sebastian hired a private detective to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding her car crash? For a 'happily married couple', there seems to be precious little trust in their relationship ..."
1,"terrible writing, appears there was no editor!","This book consists of so many run-on sentences I have to believe it was not reviewed by an editor. It seems as though the author was trying to be poetic but instead there were just many sentences that didn't make any literary sense. For example:""You've learned to love and work well enough without a guidebook, and since I'm supposed to have one for you, I can tell you the next chapter's on rest though if you need a higher authority, I understand that citizens of Spain and France and I don't know where else are expected to rest, more than a little siesta.""That is word for word what is written in the book, I have not altered or miss-copied anything. I'm only on chapter three but I doubt I will read the rest. This book is a disappointment and makes me feel as though anyone can get published!"
2,chaotic,"Like others, I was disappointed in a chaotic narrative. Also, in the mp3 download, I discovered (once again) that authors very rarely read their own work well."
3,LIFE ALL AROUND ME,"This book was good, not VERY good, but good. I enjoyed the original Ellen Foster better than I enjoyed this sequel. As usual Ellen's insight is hilarious and the ending brought me to tears. I just couldn't give the book better than a 3 star rating."
2,I'm being generous,"I'm happy I borrowed this book from the library and didn't actually spend any hard earned money. I enjoyed Ellen Foster and Virtuous Woman, although I found the author's voice dull. I feel like I'm inside the head of Ellen Foster and I'm privy to any single thought, no matter how mundane, that runs through her head. I feel like it's a book about nothing!"
2,Okay,"A bit too wordy,seemed she was ADHD .Ellen just went on and on. A disapointment when compaired to the first book Ellen Foster."
3,Life All Around Me difficult to follow the voice,"This book has a unique voice that is supposed to be Ellen Foster as she has gotten older. It is definitely a unique voice, however, it was diffucult to follow at times and did not lend itself to the empathy created in the first book when Ellen was a younger child. I sailed through the first book but struggled to finish this one."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"I loved ""Ellen Foster,"" and eagerly awaited this book, but I just could not get into it. I found Ellen's quirky writing style to be nearly indecipherable and quit trying to figure it out after reading half the book.Disappointing."
1,Highly disappointing,"I have treasured Kaye Gibbon's previous books and have always recommended her to my friends. I won't even pass this one along to anyone. The style, with Ellen's quirky syntax was not only difficult to read, but the plot (what there was of it) was terribly tedious and I simply could not relate to any of thecharacters. I finally gave up after reading half way through. Come on, Kaye, write us another wonderful book!Penelope Langan"
1,disappointment,"Gibbons missed the mark this time. I was so excited to read this, Ellen Foster is one of my ""keeper"" books, I read it over and over, share it, discuss it, and rewatch the movie. I felt like Gibbons lost her touch with Ellen in this book, lost the characters voice. I am just glad I didn't purchase this one, I didn't finish it, returned it to the library and won't be looking at it again."
5,Angst: not just for teens,"If you think that Kaye Gibbons' THE LIFE ALL AROUND ME BY ELLEN FOSTER is a novel for teens, you're sadly mistaken: Ellen Foster, the narrator and heroine in this novel, may be a teen but she's precocious and her witty and pointed observations of life and how to live it offer fresh, rewarding observations. Her movement from a difficult childhood in foster homes to an adulthood facing college and change continues to promise engrossing action in this unabridged presentation."
2,Ellen Foster is a hard act to follow...,"Kaye Gibbons is one of my favorite authors. I have worn out three copies of Ellen Foster and given several other copies as gifts so I was VERY excited to see that Ms. Gibbons was writing a follow up.But.I found this book not at all up to her standards. It rambles and the voice isn't as clear and as perfect as it was in the original. Instead of having a plot, Life All Around Me is more of a collection of Ellen's random thoughts and it was hard for me to get interested, possibly because I have such high expectations for this author's work. All in all, it was sadly disappointing."
2,"Disappointed, what happened??","This book was so disappointing to me because I read Ellen Foster and loved it. The style of this book is what killed it for me. The sentences, told in the first person, are excessively complicated and convoluted. I found myself not being able to follow what was going on and having to re-read sentences or paragraphs over. I just finished this book about a week ago and can't really remember much of the detail. I stuck with this book because I kept hoping it would come around and everything would fall into place. Didn't happen for me. I don't recommend it."
1,What Happened With Kay Gibbons Writing?,"I guess most every good writer has at least one that misses. This book missed with me. I can't even tell you what I didn't like about the plot because I didn't understand or couldn't find any real story line. Ellen Foster was a delightfully written book, easy to follow with right-on descriptions, but this sequel is so strange. Much of the writing seems like free-form associating rather than coherent writing. Not enjoyable for the reader to try to make heads or tails out of. I cannot recommend this book. I, too, hope Ms Gibbons goes back to her old writing style for her next book."
5,Stars,"These stars are very small, no larger than the diameter of a large playing marble, I'd say. I'd never trust the tack they come with, I'm easily excitable and so a star falling on me from the ceiling could easily cause my heart to stop I think so I just buy the tacky stuff separately (any brand, really) and I apply it to all 5 points. I like the brightly colored tack so I can see it when I remove the stars or rearrange them. All of the other characteristics are up to par with every other glow in the dark star on the market. Baby loves looking at the ""tars"" morning, noon, and night. And I especially love putting them up for her. It's never too early (or too late!) to learn your constellations! fun + cheap = winner!"
4,"Covers my cieling, can cut stars to make diff shapes, works alright","I miss the stickers version with the smaller stars that i got before. this is reusable though with the little putty, although it was a pain to put a piece of putty on 125 stars and then try to make them fit on the cieling correctly. tedious but worthwhile for anyones room, looks good at night and helps relax me when i go to sleep. i needed to have this"
2,"Not enough ""tacky"" substance for the number of stars","Bought this for my daughter for Christmas, when we opened it to hang the stars up, I was VERY DISSAPOINTED to see how much of the ""tacky"" substance came with the stars. I made the little balls as small as I possibly could, and still only had enough to hang 1/2 of the stars in the package. Had to go out and buy more tacky myself to finish the project. Would NOT buy this again!!"
5,Glow stars,LOVE these... I've put them on my bedroom ceiling along with several other 'kits' of varying sizes creating a 'milky way' affect. Lovely when the lights go out!! I should mention I'm a woman in my late 50's!
2,not enough putty,These are great little stars but the tacky putty stuff they give you as adhesive does not stick to the ceiling particularly well and there is certainly not enough of it in the package to apply to all the stars. Wish there were more of it
3,my opinion,"In this record, unfortunately we can't get the ""burning"" and ""inspired"" interpretation of the Teatro alla Scala of Milano directed bySchippers. Maybe because this recording was made too late. in addition, the voice of sills is very metallic and without the emotion or the art of the live."
1,Dunbar's not-so-positive techniques,"I was very interested in Ian Dunbar's ""positive reinforcement techniques"" as an alternative to more confrontational methods. I was very shocked to find out that he recommends booby-traps for effective punishent of dogs on page 72 on his book. He suggests creating a trap that drops twenty pebble-filled beer cans on your dog after the dog triggers it by taking a bacon-fat soaked bait e.g. from the trash can.Dunbar finds this kind of ""effective punishment"" very clever because it doesn't affect the dog-human relationship. I find suggestions like this completely inhumane. Traps like that will scare a dog out of his mind and you risk coming home to a traumatized and maybe even injured dog. Please do not fall for such outdated punishment-based training methods. The re-labeling of these methods as ""reward-based"" or ""positive reinforcement"" doesn't make them any less abusive."
5,Dr. Ian Dunbar Makes Training a Dog Easy & Fun....and it Works!,"I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad I did. Prior to bringing my first Black Labrador puppy home I read the entire book in one sitting. Its an easy, informative, and enjoyable read. This book does a great job of explaining how all of the things you do to train your dog are interpreted from his or her perspective. This is really an important thing for a human being to understand because it will make the relationship between you, your family, your friends, and your dog countless hours of enjoyment. Once you understand what makes a dog tick there's no limit to the things you can do and you can do a lot of it without the aid of a book.In the early going of raising your puppy you'll find yourself going back to this book often -- and the good news? It will work!Be persistent. Be Positive. You'll have a great dog that you can be very proud of, and he'll be proud of his or herself, too!"
4,a good starter book for those new to dogs,"Ian Dunbar is one of the founders of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers and was one of the leaders in promoting positive reinforcement in dog training. He has lots of great information in this book. If you want something more in-depth, this is a very good book. The only drawback is you need to have some time to read! A good choice for those new to dogs."
5,Fantastic Book,"Easily read, this book goes through basic and intermediate training that easily applied to puppies and adult dogs alike. Reviewing common commands (and the steps to take so your dog understands them) as well more advanced issues, I consider this book a ""must have"" for every dog-lovin' household. I could go on (and on) gushing about how awesome Dr. Dunbar is, but, you should read the book and decide for yourself. Having grown up with dogs I feel confident with my experience in addressing a lot of pooch-related issues on my own, and still refer to this book for a ""refresher."" More in-depth than your average ""puppy basics,"" I feel the majority of readers would find novel information and easily applied (with patience) techniques for creating household harmony and happy tails!"
4,Wonderful book on an interesting topic,"The Pioneer missions were important milestones in the exploration of space. The book is a nice, concise and well-written history of the Pioneer program, from the early and unsuccessful probes flown by the military in the immediate post-Sputnik era to the trail-blazing missions to Jupiter, Saturn and Venus. All of the book was interesting, but I thought that the story of how Ames Research Center got involved in deep space exploration, the maneuvering to get access to the Deep Space Network, and the continued gathering of data from Pioneers 10 and 11 long after their primary missions ended to be particularly interesting and never before told. I wish that the book had been a little longer, with some more detail about the spacecraft and their scientific findings. Also the meager selection of small black and white photos is inadequate. But those are minor points and this book is a must-have if the subject interests you."
1,Junque,"This thing has NO rigidity or stiffness. As you bring the unit up to your eye and press it against the eye orbit it collapses, and the tip of the eye drop bottle can make contact with the surface of the eye. How this ever got into production is a mystery."
1,NOT ALL THAT GREAT,"YES, I HAVE USED THESE AND OTHER PERSONAL WARMING PRODUCTS BY GERBER. WHILE THEY SEEM LIKE LIFE SAVERS, THEY ARE UNCOMFORTABLE TO USE. THEY DON'T WARM A LARGE AREA, IE THE WHOLE FOOT, ONLY SMALL PORTION OF THE TOP OF THE FOOT. ALSO YOU ALMOST HALF THE TIME GET NON WORKING WARMERS, I HAVE BOUGHT MANY GERBER WARMERS AS WELL AS OTHER BRANDS, AND I FIND THAT THEY WORK ALMOST ONLY 50% OF THE TIME. I DON'T KNOW WHY MAYBE BECAUSE THE BATCH IS OLD OR THEY SHIFT TO MUCH IN SHIPPING. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY ON THESE PRODUCTS. I HAVE FOUND WHILE IN EXTREME COLD WEATHER THICK WOOL SOCKS OR EVEN PRICEY BATTERY POWERED HEATED SOCKS WORK BEST. JUST REMEMBER TO CHANGE SOCKS CONSTANTLY TO AVOID TRENCH FOOT, AND FROST-BITE. ALWAYS KEEP YOUR BOOTS DRY, AND HAVE A SECOND PAIR."
2,the best songs ever ruined by uneven performing,This is a warning for all Poulenc fans NOT to take the bargain route and purchase this immense collection -- you might think you're getting a great deal but: the singing and pianism is substandard and doesn't do the music justice (remotely). Songs like Bonne Journe'e or Ho^tel are all but ruined... Here's what to buy: Bernard Kruysen's CD of selected Poulenc masterpieces (favoring the Elouard settings)... nobody will ever come close to Kruysen in interpreting Poulenc. Avoid THIS CD. They still get 2 stars for (1) being encyclical and (2) delivering clear and even sound quality.
4,An Impossible Mission for the Commandos,"The excitement in this story rocks. The Black Eagles, a CIA backed commando unit in Vietnam is sent on a POW rescue mission. That's the easy part. They're also given the job of bringing back the prison commander and the Korean brainwashing expert working on the POWs. Throw in a battalion of Vietnamese soldiers and various VietCong guerillas hunting them and you have a mission from hell. The Black Eagles blast their way through the jungles to accomplish their mission. This series in one of the best in the action/adventure genre."
5,A wonderful tale for children of all ages.,"My 4 year old nephew and I sat together and watched Capt. Blarney's adventure 3 times and I think I enjoyed it just as much as he did. The story is great fun and Capt. Blarney a loveable character. The music throughout is catchy. Enjoyable, entertaining and educational. A must have for the home video library for anyone with children."
5,Video reminds us of our great Baltimore visit!,"We discovered the terrific ""RoundAbout Tales"" video during a visit to Baltimore. We happened to have toured some of the same ships and boats that are included in this video. The kids love boats! The RoundAbout Tales story is good all by itself - fun, imaginative and even encourages storytelling. But, even better, this video is such a treat because we remember all the fun we had discovering the sub and sailing ship! Thanks!"
4,Excellent sing-along-music; great maritime fun for kids!,"As someone who writes professionally on maritime issues for business, this clever video is a great introduction to young children about ships, boats and submarines. And it's fun, too! The music on this video is very contagious - and perfect for the happy, upbeat tone of the entire video. Captain Blarney is a kick - a very likable and enjoyable character. Landlocked kids and coastal families alike will enjoy the scenery, the story of the lost ship and the on-board shennanigans. Great fun! (Good price,too)."
5,Everyone should see this film.,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. Emotionally charged and terrifyingly true, BALLOT MEASURE 9's greatest achievement is that Heather McDonald deftly connects other marginalized groups to the anti-gay initiative in Oregon, showing how all people are oppressed when one group is singled out for discrimination, no matter what the rationale. I would recommend this film especially to straight people who don't understand what gay men and lesbians are going through all over the country -- quite literally, a fight for our lives. My (straight) parents' attitudes were forever changed by this film and so will you be. BALLOT MEASURE 9 will make you scream with anger in a world full of fear and ignorance, but it will also shout for joy at the hope and love and possibilities revealed in this incredible fight for a real democracy."
5,love,My 6 year old loves this movie! Downloaded on kindel fire!! The playback is really nice with no streaming issues!
4,Really great movie,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this movie. My 7 year old really liked it and it kept me engaged as well. Nice storyline and good acting too. Nice to watch a kids movie that does not make you cringe.
4,My grand-daughters really liked this movie.,My grand-daughters really liked this movie. It has a good story told in a nice way.I would recommend it for your girls.
5,Quality AG,My 7yo Mckenna fan just lived this movie. Great message and age appropriate. Just what you can always expect from AG.
3,Disappointed,"Well i didn't look too closely at the dimensions of the stars or planets when buying, just kind of looked at the picture and thought it looked good. The stars and planets are all very small. I thought it was in a box with a good amount of material packaged but actually what you see is a piece of cardboard with all the stars and planets right there under plastic. So just was not what i was hoping for but i guess i should have studied it a little more :)"
3,It's okay but...,"I bought this for my 5 year old son who's very into planets right now. We already had some glow in the dark stars and wanted to add the planets. This kit included both, which seemed great. Now here' s the disappointing part. While the stars are a sturdy plastic and glow for a reasonable amount of time, the planets are a very thin cardboard that doesn't glow well. The planets have a fuzzy kind of coating which has the faintest glow, but really not enough to be seen well. They are detailed enough to look good when the lights are on, but to not glow in the dark is very disappointing, especially for an excited kid. If the planets were made out of the same plastic as the stars, this would probably be a great product."
3,Cool. :),"Sooo.. I used to have these as a kid. I had handfuls of stars and planets. So it's a little pricey for what they have. Still, it's an awesome little kit. The planets have names on the back, but once it's stuck on the wall, it's covered. It glows in the dark pretty awesome, though it lasts for a couple of minutes. My only set back in this was that the planets are thin cardboard. Like paper, really. They should have been plastic like the stars."
3,A Little Disappointed.....,"These Planets & Stars were bought to entice my preschooler into his room at night.There were 9 planets and 21 stars, both in different sizes. I thought that the planets would be plastic like the stars, but they were not - they were cardboard with the colored planet coated in areas with the glow in the dark substance. This was not what I was looking for. Also, the kit came with adhesive putty to stick the planets and stars to the wall - not what I was expecting, I was anticipating more of a plastic, stick on star/planet. The positives of this product is that it is cheap for the number of pieces you receive. This kit wasn't bad (especially for the price) but just was not what I was looking for."
1,Oh My Stars - What Junk!,"This was a huge disappointment. The planets are just pieces of cardboard that do not glow at all. The stars are OK but the material they give you to stick them on the ceiling or wall is useless. I went to craft store to find something better to hold them on the ceiling and found a better set with better material for sticking them on the ceiling and the set was only $1 compared to the $8 I spent on this.I do not blame this on Amazon and out of the 100+ items I have bought from Amazon, this is the only one that I was unhappy with.Tom"
3,stars glow but planets not so much,"The planets are colorful but don't really glow much. The stars work better for that purpose. The planets are ""pretty"" but it's thin cardboard material and they aren't really big (think softball size down to golf ball). The sticky stuff that comes w/ it is in short supply but I found that you can use a teeny amount and it sticks well enough."
5,My favorite kids author.,"I love Babette Cole books. She writes irreverent poetry and has it beautifully illustrated in a scatty sketchy way that is just right. There are moral lessons in here for children, but they are presented with energy, passion, fun and verve. Fun for adults to read and for children to listen.For kids, there is a reading age here of around 7."
4,its so good for beginners and intermediate,i really liked this book when i was looking for a book in this category i saw this book and i really liked it..
4,A frienjd of many years,"I've loved the Sargent G&S series on EMI for years and owned them all on lp. It was in this one that I first encountered the singing of the great Welsh tenor, Richard Lewis. I recently found his recordings of Handel Arias--the best I've ever heard--on Dutton CD's and urge fans to get it. George Baker, the Joseph Porter in this recording is ideal for G&S comic roles--funny without being silly or effete."
1,Read reviews from other sites!!!,I ordered this product and after I fought with it for a while found out it was make about 3 inches too long!!! I got online and started reading reviews on motion pro clutch cables and a lot of people have complained there cables where 1-4 inches to long also! I will not be ordering from motion pro again! It was a useless part after it wouldnt fit... kinda need to be to specification!
1,This is why I only buy books and CDs from amazon,Nothern Hydraulics has rude and incompetent customer service. I ordered the sod buster and it never came. I got billed and customer service insisted there was no order. I had to resolve it with a master card dispute.I did eventually buy a subsoiler/middle buster at my local tractor store and I love it.
2,Not Worth It!,"Nice, well made product, but super heavy. Haven't used them but can't imagine using them for anything but serving. ""Handles"" are actually the ""Lip"" of the bowls. Not bowls you would grab for everyday uses like mixing or storing things."
2,Bad...,It works but their are dead and flashing pixels.Get this instead: http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-Meters/dp/B003L1ZYYM/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1327276755&sr;=8-1-spellOfficial by Amazon so you know it's good.
5,hdmi cable,Great hdmi cable for a cheap price i have hooked to my xbox 360 and my palsma tv and recieve great 1080p picture. Would by again dont waste you time on expensive cables these work great.
1,"Defective, Twice!","I ordered one of these 10 foot HDMI to HDMI Sony Ps3 cables from and the item did not carry any signal. I tested the same connection with an HDMI cable that I already had and it worked fine, so it was certainly the new cable that was defective. Requested a replacement and it also did not work on the same connection. Retested with a cable known to work and confirmed that the replacement cable was also defective (I tried it several times).Defective consecutive products in separate shipments, at least that was my experience."
1,"ORDERED 3 CABLES, ALL DOES NOT WORK","I ordered 3 HDMI cables and they arrived on time. Problem is, and its a BIG PROBLEM, they simply do not work. These are crap!! Do yourself a favor and stay away from these. Crap, I tell you, it's crap."
1,Bad,"It did not work it just showed a blank screen, so maybe I thought I was doing something wrong. So I went to Wal-Mart and got some, and they work just fine, so now i know it wasn't me, it was the cords. Would not recommend to anyone."
4,Great Item!,Love these HDMI cables... Using them for my ps3 blueray movies and it looks great! I would definately recommend these to anyone in need a HDMI cables!
3,doesn't work for my blu-ray player,"I bought this so that I could hook my lap top up to my tv, and use my blu ray player in the HD form it's suppose to be viewed in. It works great for laptop-tv connection, but the blu ray player does not recognize it."
1,Defective Product,This cable came quickly and seemed like good quality but didn't work at all. I also had a terrible time trying to return it when I contacted the seller. Don't waste your time and money with this inferior product.For a few more bucks I got this one sold by Amazon:OSD-HDMI-15ft-Value-V14 High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet V1.4 (15-Feet)Works like a dream and came the very next day.
1,Terrible,"At first, when i hooked up my ps3 to this HDMI, I was astonished (probably cause It was my first HDTV). I thought it was good for what i paid for. Then, i went to go change the video settings to set 1080p; however, it couldn't do anything higher than 720p. I was disappointed, but, it was what i paid for so i didn't too big a deal.A weak passes, and i turn on my ps3 to play, and the video was all grainy and the sound was nonexistent. A few mins later, the picture completely vanished.Don't buy this product. It's not worth the $2 because it'll last less than 2 weeks."
1,Doesn't Work,"It worked for one day (with a fuzzy picture), then stopped working. Still haven't heard back from the seller. You're better off paying a few extra dollars for a better product."
5,Great Cable for a Cheap Price!!!,This cable is great. It only took 3 days to ship and doesn't look cheap at all. It gives the picture 1080p quality for only $1! Don't buy those expensive cables because this one works just as good for way less money.
2,Not full HD,"Be aware that the highest setting you will get with this cable is 1080i, not 1080p. Also, the description does not state it is HDMI 1.3 compliant. This is all fine if you have a 720p or 1080i set."
4,Perfect,"I had to replace my previous HDMI cable because my previous one was damaged while moving.Anyway, I was a little dubious about this item since the price was so low, but for ~$3-4 (including shipping), it was worth the risk. I have to say, this cable performs perfectly. The picture quality is just as good (if not better) as when I had my older HDMI cable (which was about 10 times the cost of this one).I've read other reviews that say this cable isn't shielded, so interference might be an issue, but to be honest, I haven't noticed any problems at all. If problems do arise, I suppose I could always wrap them in aluminum foil or aluminum tape to reduce interference."
1,Waste of money.,"The product I received looked perfect at a glance, but upon using the HDMI cable, I noticed immediately poor quality and the screen cracks out frequently. I purchased another cable locally to check if that was the problem, but the new cable works perfectly! Therefore, this company sells poorly made cables that aren't even worth the cheap prices."
4,Excellent beginner's book!,"Just getting into bird-watching? Know a youngster who is getting interested? Stan Tekiela (pronouced like the Mexican tequila) makes it easy, and he does it so practically by color-coding the identifications! ""What is that yellow bird?"" Look in the section devoted to yellow birds. Red? Look in the Red section.Pictures are sharp and clear, and his brief discussions enlightening.Strongly recommended; a great gift."
4,Very good introductory book.,"I think that both Molly and the author are both at fault for the bad review. The title is misleading if you were expecting this to be a thorough field guide of all birds in Minnesota. A quick page through (hard to do on-line) in the bookstore would have avoided this problem.I strongly disagree that this is a bad book for the beginner. In case Molly has forgotten, the biggest problem when starting out is finding the bird you see in the book. This book presents the birds in a way that you can actually find them - I realize this is a novel idea but it really works when starting out. Just my opinion."
1,Birds of Minnesota Field Guide,"This is a terrible field guide. It certainly doesn't include all the birds of Minnesota. The photographs are beautiful, but how often do you see a bird in perfect light? A better choice for the beginning birder would be The Golden Book of North American Birds. This field guide doesn't deserve one star."
2,Not to my tastes,Not what I expected. Did not like plot. Multiple intirgue was going towards too much conflict between characters. I was not in the mood to watch this.
3,The Grans,"The time period and some of the caricatures in this drama were good. Yet, not as good as others I have rented and seen. I would not buy this DVD, but for lack of a good TV show, I did rent it."
2,Fantastic plot with lots going on but takes it too far,This is a fantastic plot that could have left imagery of the mind at bay; we don't need to see nasty details that become a distraction to the entire plot. i would have bought both seasons if it weren't for the sordid details (unnecessary).
3,good and bad,"An interesting attempt at a 'politically correct' history of art, with dutiful articles on gender, otherness etc. The book is interesting partly because some of the essays at the beginning transcend the limitations of their brief, and also because they demonstrate some of the tensions and debates evident in the discipline at this time.The dictionary section is generally good on artists - but far to many minor Brits get entries. Despite the gestures towards multi-cultural values, this remains an utterly Eurocentric account of art. Some entries on 'trendy' French thinkers are really irrelevant in a book about art history, and are often laughable trivialisations of their thought (see the entry on Foucault, for example). These should have been excluded."
4,introduction for students,This book is perfect for first year audiology students as it gives a basic introduction to most audiological concepts and ideas.
3,"good glowing, not enough sticky stuff",There are tons of stars on this pack but only enough sticky tack to put up half of them. But the stars glow brightly for a while and still are glowing after a month of them on the walk. Just know you have to use very little sticky our buy some extra from the store before you get these.
3,Wimpy in the glow department,"These stars are ruggedly built and easily attached to a wall or ceiling. However their glow is disappointingly short lived. I used to have some tape based stars that glowed through the night. These plastic stars only glow well for about five minutes, disappearing completely after a half hour. I got that performance after using a high intensity flashlight to ""charge"" them from an inch away Regular room lighting produced a similar effect, but with a lot less intensity. They're okay, but I have owned much better. I wish they'd made them less rugged and given them longer luminosity."
3,would not buy again,"Too few big stars, too many tiny stars. When you hang tiny stars they do not look like stars anymore in the dark."
2,Great stars -- but they stop glowing in the dark well after a week,"As the title says -- I liked these stars. They are exactly what I was looking for and what you'd expect. The only problem is that -- while they glow really well the first day -- after a very short time, they stop glowing. Within a week, I really couldn't see them at night at all any more. Now, sometimes I can see them a little, and sometimes not at all."
1,not impressed,"I bought these for my sons bedroom, to entice him to stay in bed at night. We stuck them on the ceiling and i put a flashlight to them, they were bright stars but only lasted a few min then they started to fade. Now they do not glow at all. I have seen good ones that have a strong glow to them, and get a good charge from the natural light in the room. I know they are out there but this is not the product."
1,Very disappointed,"They tell you are buying 150 stars, BUT What they never tell you is most of them are extremely small!!! you can even hold the 150 of them with one hand! (not kidding) Only few big stars. If you look at the picture they show, it's a lie!! Besides, it doesn't have any kind of glue!!! how i'm I supposed to put then on the ceiling? somebody please explain!!! The quality of this product has definately deteriorated from the original production years ago. Don't buy it!"
3,Glow in the Dark Stars,"I like the amount of stars that come in this package and there are several different sizes but they don't give you nearly enough of the rubber stuff that you use to tack them to the wall, but toothpaste works :0)"
3,So-so --- good for the price though,"The stars glow dimly (very dim) in pitch dark room. And night lamp or a street light from the window makes these star disappears. If you are a teenager or buying for a teenage girl, then go for it. But if you are planning to use it on kids (babies, toddler, etc) where you will switch on a night lamp, then don't buy it"
5,Still glowing strongly,"We've had these stars up for almost a year now. They glow great and fade in about the time that the kiddo should be sleeping. The only suggestion is making sure to put enough of the putty that comes with it on the stars. There are A LOT of stars in the package and I was concerned about the putty making it to all of them so I was a little skimpy. Turned out there was no need for me to be as I had leftover and now, after all this time, the ones that really could have used more putty are starting to fall. I just need to find where I put it..."
4,Great Stars,Great little stars. I put them up in my sons room and he loves looking at them at bedtime. They went quite well with a Moon in My Room. My only con is it came with just a small amount of sticky tack. Considering how many stars are included it could have been more. Other than that it is a good buy.
2,Not enough tacky glue,"I was very conservative with the tack provided, also knowing from previous experience a minimum is needed or they'll fall down. I was only able to put up 1/2 the stars, and now have to buy more tack to do the rest."
5,Fun for kids!,"My kids (2 and 4 years) both love having these on their ceiling at night! It's true that they don't glow for long (maybe 45 minutes), but to be honest, they're usually not awake that long once the lights go out."
5,Great glow stars,"This product glowed great, could of had more large stars, but definitely better then the other brand of stars I purchased. Glowed really bright with only a few minutes of light on them. My 3 year old loves them, I made all sorts of swirls and stuff, she loves showing them to everyone that comes over."
2,Peeled paint off ceiling.,"Bought these at my four year old's request to decorate her big girl room. She loves them. However, we went to relocate a few of them and they peeled the pain off the ceiling in one spot and in another spot you can see where they had been peeled off. VERY disappointing. Maybe next time I will get a better quality putty. I think 3M makes some that does not peel paint. UGH."
2,Disappointed,"I have purchased Great Explorations glow in the dark stars before, quite a few years ago. I was much more satisfied with the quality of the stars then. This order of stars bragged about the amount of stars in the package. What they don't tell you is most of them are extremely small. The few big stars they give you don't seem to absorb the light as well as the small ones. The quality of this product has definately deteriorated from the orignal production. Other than that, the order came quickly and I had no other problems. The little stars do hold the light well, but they are small."
3,meh,"I was expecting way more decently sized stars, but there were only 5 big ones and maybe 20 medium. All of the rest were tiny. I still love them though. I just want more..."
3,Too many tiny stars.,"Wish there were more medium/large sized stars. Way too many of the little teeny tiny stars, my daughter loves them though."
4,"These are great, but see below","These were great. They do well by taking their charge from whatever light is available. They do fade, but work really well for 3+ hours. This was great because they look cool and have a definite consistent glow, but fade when trying to sleep.Only reason for 4/5 is because there needs to be enough putty for all the stars, but there is a generous amount."
2,It did not last very long.,The stars and pieces have stored in the stock for too long. They lost brightness and not work well. I don't recommend it. You can see it for yourself. But it's not a toy and it's not a product.
3,"Item was as expected, celestial stars for the ceiling. :)","All was good, arrived quickly and in great shape, I would happily order through this vendor again. 5 Stars for them! :)"
1,Didn't even last 24 hours!,"My 4 year old hates sleeping in the dark, but her 16 month old brother prefers sleeping without any lights, so I thought putting these stars on the ceiling of their room would be a nice compromise. My daughter was so excited when we put them up, and they shined so brightly. By the next night, she was crying again b/c they didn't light up anymore. Don't waste your money on this!"
1,Boo!,"Go on easy enough, although time consuming, but glow for less than two minutes and then fade to nothing. Totally disappointed because I wanted to teach my son about the stars not crap products."
4,Not just for kids! =),"Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who had painted his apt black and wanted to decorate it with stars. Although a lot of the stars are stickers, there was still a lot of plastic stars to put on the walls. They are super-bright, even if you just flick the lights on and off. I can't tell how long they last if you leave the lights on for a while but the effect really is beautiful. He recreated some of the constellations using the star maps enclosed. I would definitely buy this product again; might take another 3 packs to decorate his whole place."
3,Just Okay,"I bought these hoping that they would last most of the night in my son's room. We leave his window open all day, and close the blinds while reading to him before bedtime. The first 20-25 minutes they glow GREAT and look amazing, but then you can hardly see them - and about the time they are petering out, we are shutting off his lamp for him to go to bed.. Lame. The amount of stars was perfect for his 10x11 room, but we did run out of the putty. I think if you have smooth ceilings, there will be enough putty, but we have popcorn ceilings and needed more to get the stars to stick."
2,Do not charge or stick well,These stars only hold their charge for about 1 minute and they've started falling off the ceiling & wall. I don't recommend
4,glowing,These stars are perfect for a kids bedroom they glow great but after a while they lose their glow they charge on light/daylight so when you turn the light on the stars are brighter than usual.
5,Looks great! Good price!,I bought these for my daughters room and she LOVES them! When the lights go out it looks like a planetarium in there! Very cool! Also the adhesive is a light gum-like blob that doesn't destroy the walls and makes it easy for moving the stars if necessary.
5,bright stars!,the stars have worked very well for the last few months and like up bright at night. My 3yo son loves them. We use them for rewards over here. ;-)
3,"great stars, way too little adhesive","There are a lot of stars in this packet but not nearly enough adhesive. I realized there wasn't a lot in the package so I used it sparingly when I put it on the stars. We only had enough for less than half of the stars. A few fell because there wasn't enough sticky stuff on the back. BUT, they are fun and our daughter really loves them."
5,C++ Builder Starter Kit,"This product is okay but not the C++ Builder I expected with a true visual C++ development environment. As far as I can see you must know code to use this product. My desire was to find a visual component pallet that writes the code for me by dragging visual symbols onto the unit and then compiles the unit into an executable program. My older program C++ Builder 3 does this and I was looking for an upgrade. Maybe, I just need to work with product longer."
3,great book,"This is a very good book. It is amazing the way all the characters and story line comes together in the end. It is easily a book you can fall into and read in one night. Tiffany is an amazing little girl. Even though no one pays a single mind to her, she holds the key to all the secrets. There are a lot of things in this book that are on the sad side. Such as the Terry and Eddie incident. It just shows how powerful evil really can be."
4,Great for showing what goes on it prison,Interesting how the film crew got into prisons to film this show. It displays all of what happens during prison life.
3,A Fun Adventure,This review concerns the original 1942 edition and the revised 1969 edition which is an edited version of the original. Nancy becomes involved in the search for the missing half of a treasure map and investigates the mysterious happenings at a cottage on an estate just outside of River Heights. This is a pretty good book; more deserving of 3 1/2 stars. The story is intriguing and well-written. One thing that I like about this story is that there are numerous dishonest people also searching for the missing half of the map and you don't know if they are working together against Nancy or if they are working seperately. This is an enjoyable adventure and is highly recommended.
4,A fun book to read - a review by OF,"I like this book a lot. I like it because of the people in the book and because of what happens in the book. Lots of people in this book are very nice, they try to help each other as much as possible. People that I like in this book are : Nancy , Hanna Gruen , Ellen ,Mrs Chatham , Mr Smith , Mrs Smith and Ned. This book is fun.This book is about is about a treasure. Nancy and Mr and Mrs Smith want to find a treasure. They had two maps of the treasure. One day, a man stole one of the maps at Mr and Mrs Smith's house. Nancy and Ellen were trying to stop the man and they couldn't. Nancy had the other map, and one day someone stole the other one from Nancy when she was walking.One day, they tried to make a map with their imaginations because they had to find the treasure. It took them a little while to make a map. But they found the treasure later."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!,"My friend bought this and she let me listen to it on the bus, it ruined my CD. My CD was perfectly fine until I put it in the player. My CD became scratched and wouldn't play many songs. I do not reccommend this CD player. It's very cheap and is a very poor imitation of a CD player!!!I'm 13 and i know the difference between a good and bad player!"
3,Natasha,"This is the story of a Russian stripper who witnesses a murder, and assumes the identity of her cousin, who was killed in an attempt to kill Natasha,she travels to England and moves in with a British minister's family (her cousin was a foreign exchange student, meanwhile the Russian mob as well a Russian detective are trying to track her down. While the is plenty of topless nudity in this picture, it rises above the average ""stripper"" movie, the story is well written and fairly well acted, but rest assured their is plenty of sex to go around.razorback fan"
4,A surprise,This actually has a nice heart to it! I smiled a lot while watching. Some interesting side stories intertwined. There's nudity but it's not about nudity. Lead actress has a presence that's hard to ignore. Good character development and acting too. Also very scenic.
4,"Very, very good","First of all this movie is NOT ""unrated"" (at least my copy wasn't, and I doubt that an unrated cut really exists). It's R-rated and pretty standard fare for sexy R-rated films...in fact considerably tamer than some.That's the only reason that I gave it four stars and not five. Not even any full-frontal shots. Big disappointment.However, everything else about this movie is a grand-slam. Great story. Nice nudity and sexiness. Funny. Touching even, at moments. Thrilling and suspenseful. Well-written for the most part and very well-acted.And you, as I, will fall in love with the adorable lead, Algina Lipskis. Absolutely gorgeous, killer body that she doesn't at all mind showing off. And a really good little actress with good comedic timing. I'm going to try to find more films with her in them.Not truly an example of soft-core fare--a half-step backwards from true erotic thriller territory--but worth viewing and even, I dare say, worth buying."
4,Sexy movie,"I've seen this movie, and I would recomend it for people that likes action. It is a thriller movie that involve sex, sensuality and exotic dancers.*Sponsored Post"
4,natasha,not bad...i actually enjoyed it. yea the acting was not the best...but if you like seeing naked women than you should check this out.i know the trailer they show you is really pathetic...but in this movie it shows that some families and people aren't who they present themselves to be.
1,Duran Duran,"why dosent anyone give Duran Duran credit for their song ""Ordinary Wold""? screw Aurora and Naimee Coleman! the song gets 5 stars but -4 because of stupid people!"
5,This is great stuff,"This piece of work rocks, and Naimee's voice is just fantastic mixed beautifully by Aurora, making this an absolute buy. The radio edit version simply impresses you with a club kind of atmosphere... even Duran Duran would be impressed. Anyone wanting to buy this, there is not a moment to lose. P"
3,alright,this is an alright product nothing to write home about when you compare it to what else is out there. i bought it bc my sons school used it. otherwise i would not have purchased.
4,It's OK,"This software has some fun games, but it didn't keep my kindergarten student engaged for more than one session of learning. He played on all of the games and was ready to move on to something else. I felt that with most kindergarten children however, that it would hold their attention and could be used over and over. It's educational value is not as good as it could be (instead of using art/painting and music, they could substitute for other academic areas), but it's engaging and fun. It has other activities (reading/math) that are very educational."
2,Requires Quicktime,Since I don't want Quicktime on my computer this was a waste of money. Quicktime has a habit of taking over your computer whether you want it to or not. Last JumpStart game I buy. Wish Amazon had listed Quicktime in the spec requirements.
4,How to run on 64-bit Windows-7,"When I tried to install on our Windows-7 PC I got an error message saying it was not compatible with 64-bit Windows.Doing some research it seams that this is truly ""classic"" software designed for old 16-bit systems. Windows is only backward-compatible one generation... so 16-bit software will work on 32-bit windows (usually) and 32-bit software will work on 64-bit windows (usually), but 16-bit will NOT work on 64-bit.The good news is that if you have Windows-7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate you can install ""XP-Mode"" which will let you run windows-xp as a virtual machine. You can then install this in XP and run the program that way. The really nice thing is that you can make a shortcut from the program inside the virtural-XP and place it on your Windows-7 desktop and it will appear to run like any other normal program. Setting this up took about a half-hour (after 15 min or so to download the installer).Here is the link to download XP-Mode: [...]"
2,Couldn't get it to run,"My new laptop wouldn't run this program. I think it is my fault for buying it without checking the details, but before you look at this before ordering it."
5,Chllds learning,"It was a good program, but even though she is only 4, it was all too easy for her. She likes familiar things."
4,Great Read,Useful information and definitely not for beginners. Great for handicappers trying to take the next step. It is probably ready for another revision as new aspects of horse racing have come into play over the last 5 years.
4,Buy this if you are already skilled and want an edge,"I bought this book as a novice thoroughbred better, and no one in my casual group of horserace friends has been able to glean much useful information from it. I should have been warned--the title clearly states that it is for professionals. While this book didn't help me personally, it is probably an excellent resource for someone already in the field looking for the next step in their edge over the house.I'm posting this review as a caution to other people who might be looking for a good introduction to horse racing. This isn't it. Leave this one for the professionals."
1,Horseracing,I never received this book nor did the seller reply to my e-mail. I was ready to blame the post office but now I'm not so sure.
2,does this book help you make money...no,"i have read just about every popular book on horserace betting and the acid test is: does it help beat the races?the name of the game in betting thorougbreds is data mining and processing, which can only be done with software on a computer.i have software that allowed me to test some of the factors cited in this and other popular books. the bottom line... yes you get a high percentage of winners but unfortunately these horses are overbet, indicating that the info in this and other popular books is well known and used by the betting public. to beat the horses you have to think outside the box.so in conclusion don't waste your time reading this book."
5,To The Stars And Back!,"I bought these for my son's room to go with a mobile of the Solar System to hang in his room. He loved being able to put together his ""own"" constellations. They glow pretty brightly as well and with the Solar System, they just look fantastic.He has plans to go to Pluto one day - maybe this will help keep him on the right track. ;)"
4,The best glow in the dark stars I've had!,"I bought the stars to decorate my dorm room! I really like the life time warranty; it makes the stars worth the money! It was nice because you only need a little bit of putty for each star, and sticks just fine! I like how there are four different sizes of stars, and it charges really fast! right now, it stops glowing fast too, but I'm satisfied enough. :)"
3,Only stays bright for 10 minutes,"Unless you shine a high powered flashlight at each star they do not get very bright. And then they only stay bright for about 10 minutes, then they are dim for about 20, and then you can't see them at all."
3,They're alright but a lot of work,The small stars are really small so we really only use the large few on the walls. So there really wasn't 50 stars as far as we were concerned. A much better option would be to get one of those toys that project stars onto the walls and ceiling. My girls aged 3 and 5 loved that and we never really got to pasting the stars on the wall
1,Horrible Toy,This is a horrible glowing stars toy. The putty that comes with this that you have to apply to the stars is very minimal and you don't have enough to apply to all the stars that come with it. You maybe get to put the putty on 20 out of the 50 stars max. You can put less putty on the stars to try and get more stars on the wall but they eventually fall off. I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone.
4,Glow In The Dark Stars,"I thought there were more of them, but they worked out just fine. You may need to purchase more putty as I did. Put them up on Sunday and as of today, there are no problems."
4,"Nice, but....","I really like the stars as they bring a little something extra to my ceiling. But, there is no where NEAR enough puddy included to put all the stars up on the ceiling. This company was way to cheap with the puddy and nothing else really works well to keep the stars up. Now I have way less stars up than I wanted. Bummer! :("
3,OK,"My daughter got this in her Christmas stocking. I wasn't impressed with the price of shipping. She really liked it though and said she'd like more of it. I wouldn't buy it again, just because it cost more to ship than to buy. Companies would do allot more business I think if they'd charge a reasonable price for shipping. Handling fees have gotten way out of hand."
3,Not enough sticky stuff,Just not enough of the sticky putty included to stick them all up. Very nice stars but needs more sticky!
2,No twinkle... just glitter glued to the star.,These stars just have glitter glued on them and don't give the illusion of twinkling at all. Glitter is easily rubbed off.
1,deluxe face shield,"I would like to review this piece of safety equipment, unfortunately the seller has neglected to send it to me. It's been over two weeks. No contact from the seller. I cancelled the order. Next time a seller profile is consistantly in the 70% rating, I will not order from them. Lesson learned."
3,Introduction to Geocaching,"As someone just starting geocaching, I found Erik Sherman's book to be a fair introduction. The meat of the book is found in chapters 6 and 7, ""On the Hunt"" and ""In Hiding"". The tips and tricks discussed show the thoughts of an experienced geocacher. The specifics in earlier chapters such as how to fold a map are simple and very useful. The instructions on how to use a compass were limited and could use some specific examples. Chapter 5, ""A Good Walk"", could be useful for someone with no experience with the outdoors, but are of limited value for someone with experience. The photos that are included may date the book quickly."
3,A new field of study,"For those of us that wish to look at the foundations of the case study, Banfield's book is a good start. The only problem is his definition of what constitutes a backwards scoiety. His work was new and intruiging, but it explains the human nature without addressing human nature. By nature, humans are selfish. In the case of an isolated village, the people of Montegrano were not backwards. Instead they were doing what was necessary to survive. They did not organize for the greater good of society because they were too busy searching for food for that day and the next. That does not seem backwards. That seems like survival of the fittest,to use a tired cliche. Whenever examining a case study, we need to be sure that we do not generalize the subject."
2,You dropped a bomb on me,I was disappointed in this version of the song It didn't have the same arrangement and didn't sound as good as it usually does.I haven't even listened to the others on the album I bought it for that particular song
3,Not the best choice available,"I own a few Bollywood Dvds and I have also taken some workshops in Bollywood and India dances. The instruction is good but the music choice is really boring. If there is something I like about Bollywood is the energy of the dance. This cannot be appreciated in the Dvd. The music does not seem to fit the moves...Also, if you are looking to get a basic insight in mudras, I would not recommend this Dvd. The mudras showed are the very basic ones without any explanation on the meaning of them (only 5 gestures and the chapter lasts for 5 min.). For anyone that has been previously exposed to Indian culture (even in the most basic way) this Dvd will not reveal any new aspects.I will not encourage anybody to buy this dvd. Better options can easily be found."
3,great book despite a few annoying factors...,"Fantastic book - i've stayed on Lago de Atitlan and can testify, the place is touched. the magic is thick there (as is the sadness of seeing, firsthand, Mayan culture getting wiped off the face of the earth as they succumb to things like pentacostalism)...my only nitpicks about this book are minor and have nothing to do with the subject matter - where's the editor? Martin Prechtel's writing is over-colorful and could stand some fine-tuning. a few less adjectives, adverbs, and godawful similes would have made me love this book twice as much."
2,it's ok,i lost interest in the book by chapter 3 so that was nit good. others may enjoy iy though i just did not
4,More Than a Memoir,"Prechtel's journey into the heart of the Mayan culture makes for an interesting and informative read, though it would be a mistake to think (as one reviewer did) that this is the equivelant of a shamanic studies course. It is one man's experience of one aspect of an ancient shamanic culture (the Mayan culture) that has and continues to be diluted (one might even say poisoned) by the unconscious expansion of other cultures. But it is more than a memoir, as the author offers some important observations about the state of our planet and the nature of humanity. I would not get hung up on the idea of magic, gods, or Martin as a shaman, but rather enjoy beauty of the writing and the gift of the tale."
3,ambivalent and holding,"doris lessing is my favorite author, i turn to her shikasta series when things get really tough and i need to have a long term view. it is my understanding that ""memoirs"" was written in response to her editors request for an autobiography. i have read the book a number of times and still have to think about the ending. this is why a rating of three stars, i suppose for some people that would be reason for a five star (at least it makes her think)this film is perfect for the time we live in as her time could become our time, after september 11, ase as we say. in this film there is no sense of safety, there is no sense of continuity, there is no sense. it is the ""end of time"" for what may be civil society in a small area of england.i intend to have ""viewing parties"" for my friends. bleak views can be mitigated in unexpected ways...and, there is re assurance in numbers.thanks"
3,Decent Enough Lessing Adaptation,"Not many Lessing novels make it to the screen, and David Gladwell adpated this one back in 1981. While no one could be better cast than Julie Christie, the film suffers from Gladwell's lacklustre but competent direction and realization. It's one of those novels that is very personal, and plays better in the imagination than on the screen, especially when it comes to depicting the feral children. The electronic score seems misplaced until the last strains, and film remains as oblique as the book, which is good. Watch it for Christie - luminous as always - but read the novel beforehand."
2,Not true to Abercrombie sizing,"I doubt the authenticity of this denim jean. Not only are they way too small (I always wear a size 2 Abercrombie pant and these won't even button closed), but the size on the tag looks as though it was modified somewhat. The measurements given in the description are inaccurate- I recommend ordering a size up or purchasing directly through Abercrombie to guarantee authentic items."
5,The Mansion by Henry Van Dyke,"Few books have left such a lasting impression on me. I red it last Christmas, and many times reflected on it's principles. I will read it every year at Christmas time along with the Christmas story from Luke."
5,Great book,"I believe this is one of the best books I've ever read, Irecommend to anyone. Its got a good message."
3,The Mansion,A gentle reminder of those things that are truly important as you review your life. Much like the Christmas carol and Scrooges' review of life.
4,Well told; will probably grow on me.,"Short enough to read in one sitting; worthy of reading again and again. One of those ""good, moral stories."" Well written; concise, poignant, uplifting.Makes you (re)evaluate your life and want to be a better person, without being preachy. This is one that will probably grown on me in years to come."
5,Great story for Christmas Time,"I enjoyed this short story, it was a very quick read and it gives me a lot to think about as the Christmas season is upon us."
4,From self-righteous irritating pomp...,"...to enforced humility.John Weightman is Scrooge taken to the next level. He is the kind of charitable soul who gives 'to be seen of men' and considers doing good a solid investment if done prudently. Anonymous service is certainly not on his agenda.Of course that all changes when Weightman has his own epiphany, opening his eyes to the reality and consequences of his choices.This is a lovely story. Quick and easy to read, but its impact will stay longer. It puts worldly achievements and possessions into proper perspective and reminds us all of the true spirit in which we should live our lives, at Christmas and all other times."
1,The cover is the book I ordered. The inside book is NOT!,"The book cover says ""The Mansion"" just as in the picture. However the book inside is ""Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) Explained"". I bought this book at the beginning of the year for my book club's December read. Today when I opened it, that's what I discovered.Seller, I can't find any way to contact you. I'm pretty bummed about this. Can you help a girl out or not?"
4,The Mansion makes you think...,I liked the book. I thought that the author did a good job with the story. I loved the message of the book. Are we loving and serving our neighbors?
5,The Mansion,"""The Mansion"" is a good book and certainly reminds us what is important in life. I would recommend everyone read it."
1,I changed this rating from 5 stars to 1 star!,They modified the scent of this. It used to be the best. It is horrible now. What were they thinking?
1,New Car Scent - No Longer True,"Originally, the Auto Expressions ""New Car"" scent was the best new car air freshener scent on the market. It had just the right freshening quantities, however that has changed. It appears that AE has monkeyed with formula and changed it to something that no longer represents anything remotely like a new car smell. I know that I am not being fair to ""monkeys"" here, but even they would not create a scent like this one....or maybe they would!"
1,WHAT WERE THEY STINKING!?!?!,"Have you ever heard the saying if it aint broke dont try to fix it!?!? I also bought the rest of the bottles at AutoZone when I started finding the orginal spray hard to find. The dude at the counter looked at me a little funny but as soon as I misted this stuff in the air he understood why I was buying all of them. Maybe we can figure out the formula and create it ourselves!!! Just went to Auto Exspressions Website and contacted them about this ""new formula"" and how it smells bad. I also mentioned how the orginal spray was not only auto exspressions best scent but the best scent on the market! I will update this review when I get a response as to what they are going to do to bring back our orginal scent. And NO I HAVENT FOUND ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THE ORGINAL SCENT... A BIG FAT BOOOOOOOOOO TOOO AUTO EXSPRESIONS ""NEW"" CAR SCENT!!!!!!"
4,So Many Myths so Little Time!,"This book cleared up many misconceptions about buying properties in Mexico. I feel that with a U.S. Tile Company and a lawyer, I can move ahead buying property with less fear. I also liked the analysis of each potential investment location i.e. what to do, crime stats, hotels, and were to look on-line. I couldn't put the book down!"
3,Giving it a 3 because it did contain some useful information,"It deserves 3 stars because it did contain some useful information which was unknown to me, however it wasn't that great of a read. There are not a whole lot of books on buying a home in Mexico so this one will have to do for now."
2,Very Poorly Written,"I found this book very poorly written, incredibly boring, and repetitive to the point that the eyes glaze over after a while. I think one of the writers must be a lawyer whose intention is to make things obscure rather than clear. It needs a thorough editing, but I think the person would be ""mad as a hatter"" before s/he finished the task. As another reviewer observed, the book should be greatly reduced in size, and Stewart Title Company should pay for advertisement -- if it had not already done so. Appendix B ""Getting Into Mexico"" is totally out of date."
5,The MJ of Freestyle!,What an amazing voice this artist has from above! She is truly blessed with the gift of song. The lyrics are heartfelt and the beats are catchy.You go girl! Wop-Wop!I encourage everyone to buy it!
3,A New Enriquez with a Somewhat Borrowed Style,I have listened to about every album she has produced in the early 90s and this album sounds kind of like a labored effort. Maybe it's because the melodies don't really stand out and nothing sticks at the end. I can't help to think that her voice now is somewhat reminiscent of Jennifer Lopez. Just glad I still have some past memories of Jocelyn's style and vibrance. Still it's good to see her still making music. :)
2,Phone OK - LCD Display Not,"I bought this product based on other reviews (which were positive).The phone itself, and the features, are as advertised and it performed as expected (OK). However, I had a problem with the LCD Display.After just a few months of use, the LCD Display began breaking up. Since the phone is not plugged in to a power outlet (the LCD is run from batteries), I thought replacing the batteries would solve the problem. Not so.Eventually, the LCD display became unreadable (not something you want for CallerID). Maybe I got a lemon, but I did not seek to exchange it for the same model based on this problem and I would not recommend it to anyone else."
4,LCD works fine on 2 phones,"I have had my two AT&T; 959 phones for years, and never had a problem with the LCD displays.If the microphone for the speaker feature was able to pick up my voice better, I would give it 5 stars. Even the handset volume seems to be a bit low because I am often asked to speak up."
4,Three problems here,"There are three problems with this MIKADO. (1)The Ko-Ko is very well sung but badly miscast in that the voice is far too heavy and serious for the role. (2) The Pooh-Bah is far too light-voiced for a role that calls for a basso-profundo. (3) The relatively short score is spread across 2 CDs with nary a filler to make it more attractive economically. Telarc fits the entire score (minus the overture and a stanza of the Little List Song) onto a single CD, while another EMI version gives a generous helping of IOLANTHE to fill up the second disc. A very fine cast otherwise with operatic voices that do not at all hurt Sullivan's music. Sound is of course state of art for back then, not now."
3,Does not fit Vanagon,"Its a great idea but the part Amazon sent me does not fit my 1988 Vanagon, I mean it could fit but you'd see 1/2 inch of the old mirror on the sides. I received a part number 09127 and this says part number 99127"
3,Not as expected,"I expected a better quality and that it supported better to the heat. It showed some damage when I was preparing some pancakes. It was never exposed directly to the heat, but it showed some damage."
3,Adequate,"Pros:The tongs are very useful. They work well and the fact that they close up for storage is helpful.The spatula scrapes well and is appropriately flexible.Cons:The flipper is VERY floppy. This is fine for something light, such as a cookie, but is horrible if you are trying to flip something like a grilled cheese sandwich. It will just bend and you risk your sandwich falling off.It's a good value for what you receive, but make sure you don't expect really even average work out of the flipper. Use it maybe for a pancake or a cookie but use a stronger flipper for making your sandwiches or dishing up chicken or lasagna."
3,Average cooking set,"The spatula is nice and works as expected. The tongs have plastic tips, which should resist most heat. Still, I was going to use these to turn items while frying….now, I guess I shouldn’t. The ‘flipper’ is thin, which is mixed blessing. I like the ability to get under a pancake, but find the thin flipper a bit weak for some cooking tasks. Overall, a nice addition to the kitchen."
3,"Pretty good set, but spatula end started melting","This is a pretty good set overall, but the end of the spatula started to melt quite a bit which is disappointing. We had to throw it out because we were worried about the plastic getting in the food."
4,Just Plain Funny,"Say what you will about Jay Ward's cartoons, but it's all been said before. Yes, the animation wasn't the greatest, but to me they were just plain funny. I appreciate them more as an adult than I did as a child because I understand the jokes which makes them funnier. I loved them as a child and I still love them. So go ahead and just laugh, laugh, laugh. You'll feel so much better."
1,Why has this taken so long just to get it out the door and ship it?,Why has this taken so long just to get it out the door and ship it?Why has this taken so long just to get it out the door and ship it?
1,Gave me a headache,"Everything is distastefully insane. Not funny, illogical, and no point at all. Just stupid. I don't think Forrest Gump would like it either."
3,Good videos -- lousy DVD,"The material is great, but I can't recommend this DVD because its programming is so irritating. The viewer is forced to sit through several tedious previews for some truly unimpressive children's videos. Attempting to fast forward or skip to the next item is produces the message ""Operation Prohibited By Disc."" This is unforgivable."
3,"Fairy tales 10/10, marketing rubbish at the beginning 0/10",These fantastic tales would have been given a five star rating except that all I can say is SHAME ON the distributors who repackaged this collection. How can any marketing guru think that by continually punishing us by forcing us to endure the non related promotional tripe that they attach like a virus in the form of unrelated promos will sell more dvds? Happy? NO. Ready to lynch the people who did this? YES.I can only assume that these people weren't even born when we first viewed these timeless masterpieces as children and somehow feel threatened by the competition.It's enough to make you hunt down a dvd pirate who could make a copy with just the fractured fairy tales only. That's the only way I can think we will be able to repeatedly watch this dvd minus the opening advertising epics that we certainly didn't pay for.
3,Fun... But more in a retrospective way,"I actually downloaded this video for my children. I remember the whole Bullwinkle series fondly, and I remembered the Fractured Fairy Tales as being clever and funny... BUT on viewing it again, I must say that the Tales don't hold up as well as I would have thought.My children -- who are currently 9 and 11 yo -- were immediately drawn to the voices and images, however they didn't want to view it again. Bad sign.I watched them and my response was 'meh'. The stories were interesting. I still liked the narrator and idea of the stories but they were not as clever as I remembered. The plot twists, weren't that twisty.THE SKINNY:::Worth watching. I loved the trip down memory lane and can't wait to watch some of the old Rocky and Bullwinkle shows.I'm thinking that for today's TV savvy kids, that the Fractured Tales might be more suitable for younger viewers -- 5 to 9 years perhaps."
3,Memories,A cool little trip down memory lane. I remember seeing these during the Rocky n Bullwinkle show as a kid so bought them for nostalgic reasons. They are not as funny or entertaining as I remember... but still a cool little piece for my cartoon collection. If you have little ones... they would probably get a kick out of them too.
4,Good Addition to Your DVD Collection,"When I was little, one of the most watched things in the house was an old tape of Fractured Fairytales. When I found out there was a DVD for the shorts, I bought this volume 1 addition. It wasn't all the ones I remembered, though. It sort of disappointed me there were more volumes you had to but to find the ones you remember NOT on the disc. So if you're a fan of the ""Elves and the Shoemaker"" or ""Snow White and Rose Red"" this isn't one you should consider. But if you like say ""Sleeping Beauty"" or ""The Magic Fish"" this isn't a bad buy."
5,Great,"I love the old comics. Looney tunes, Rocky and Bullwinkle. This is a great addition to anyones collect of old comics. I used to wake up at 5 AM every Saturday morning when I was a kid to watch these old comics. I am glad now I can watch them when I want and relive my childhood!!"
2,Not as Funny as I remember,When I was young I thought this show was really funny but now it just seems silly. The plots make no sense even for spoofs. Example: One story is about A commoner who becomes a war hero because he carries around a rotten fish that causes the enemy to surrender just to be rid of him. Some may find it funny but it's not for me.
3,"Ehhhhh ... if you are not an avid poker player, this might be fun.","The game play is just much too slow and repetitive, and really there is no inclination to play if it is not for real money. There is not much replay appeal, and the story mode is weak. The AI is alright, but if you like playing poker, don't play this game, since it will only cause you to hate the game."
5,Terrific! Only the sounds of nature.,"All these CDs have only nature sounds -- no human-generated music. I think it is the same with all the CDs in the Echoes of Nature (Laserlight Series). Or at least of the ten or so that I have from this series, none of them have any added music. The five CDs in this boxed set are:Tropical Lagoon,Echoes of Nature: Tropical LagoonBeluga Whales,Echoes of Nature: Beluga WhalesKiller Whales,Echoes of Nature: Killer WhalesHumpback Whales,Echoes of Nature: Humpback WhalesThe North Coast,The North Coast"
5,Breath of fresh air,"I hope that Ricky realizes that he has finally found his true voice with the release of his Unplugged album. By the way, many kudos to the musicians in this album, each song was superbly executed, which at the same time allowed Ricky to find an ideal platform for his break-through performance. He should continue on this path not only for his fans, but for himself, because it is very obvious that his soul is closer to home in this creation.Congratulations to all who were part of this. Simply outstanding, a breath of fresh air. This is a must-have CD+DVD"
4,like all unplugged sometimes better than the originals,"If you like this type of sound, also check out the Alanis Morissette unplugged CD. Not all songs are outstanding, but enough are to make the CD worth spinning from time to time."
5,Wonderfully Surprised,"Despite the fact that he is a fellow Puerto Rican, I was never drawn to Ricky Martin nor his music. In fact, I've never listened to any of his songs besides the obvious Livin' La Vida Loca. A friend who is a musician recommended that I purchase it and did without regrets. The musical arrangements are superb as well as the instrumentation. Martin's voice is in good shape too. I think it was about time he did something like this so people will start taking his artistry more seriously.VIVAN TODOS LOS LATINOAMERICANOS !"
5,Increible Disco de Ricky Martin,"Realmente estoy sorprendido con el crecimiento de este artista latino, yo como latino (argentino), recomiendo este gran disco, una buena seleccion de temas y version increilbes.PAra el que no entiende la lengua castellana, solamente imagine como sonaria en otro idioma.Ya era hora un MTV Unplugged para Ricky Martin.Super recomendable este disco, y muy buena las tres canciones nuevas.Saludos desde Argentina!!"
3,this is not an unplugged...,it sounds just like a normal cd...the point is that almost every songs seems to be just recorded in a studio.3 stars for the songs selection.0 stars for the unplugged...just 3 songs seems to be unplugged
2,Not as good as the rest of the series,"I had purchased the entire collection of ""Beats"", World Beats, Karmha Beats etc. I was excited to receive this but find it to be much less interesting that the rest of the collection. CD one is comprised of very static Dance mixes with wailling female vocalists layered on top. CD two is closer to the level of previous compilations.If you like the other ones, I would avoid this compilation. It will not add anything worthwhile to your collection"
4,zootzilla is here,straighht up p funk clone from the school of p university this mug took serious notes from george this cd is a good addition and features serious guitar work from michael hampton.
4,Nice tester,I use this tester every day for my job and it has done no wrong. I have many hours on this unit and I haven't had to replace the battery. It doe's have a fuse protected amp meter.
2,Item received is different than ordered,The item that you receive is Huracan energy drink. It seems to be the same contents but a different packaging. It looks like Iron Energy is going after the mexican market.
3,Sound advice for a conservative investor,This very short book can be read in a single sitting. It gives 17 pieces of sound advice for the conservative investor. Much of the advice is fairly obvious to anyone with more than six months of investing experience. Not a book for the daytrader or the system trader.
3,Cinderella,"Bought the DVD for my granddaughter and gave it to her last weekend. When they opened it to watch they noticed that it was different from my original copy. It seems it is a homemade copy. DVD worked ok and my granddaughter doesn't know the difference, but I am disappointed. I don't believe it said anywhere that it wasn't an original copy. If it did, I sure missed it."
2,excited then disappointed,"Received Cinderella and was delighted and after it played 3 times, it now has stops in it and there is no apparent scratch to make this happen. Not sure why, but disappointed for my grand daughter."
3,Too Much Cat and Mice...,"The Story of Cinderella is a simple one. But Disney complicated it with peripheral characters who were made primary characters. I'm talking about ""Lucifer"", the cat and the other two mice. The story focuses more on them then on Cinderella. The antagonists in Cinderella are the Stepmother and the stepsisters. There was no pay off for them in the end....no comeuppance. Disappointing. The prince was also incidental. This is one of Disney's mediocre efforts because of the poor writing. The animation and songs are lovely. But if you want to watch Cinderella, watch Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1965 version starring Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon. Skip this one unless you like the animals to take center stage."
2,Cinderella DVD,"I ordered this movie for my child for Easter. It plays just fine on our new DVD player, but our older DVD player won't recognize it at all and neither will our computer."
2,IRKED!,"I don't get paid for my reviews. When I write one I am moved to do so. In this case, I support James Aux.. Product details: C-3, Animated, Closed-captioned, Color, DTS Surround Sound, Dubbed, NTSC, Subtitled, Widescreen. That is WRONG. Misrepresented. It is not Wide Screen. And I don't know anything about ""Disneyview"" but I will look into that and see how that affects the experience. When it's not something, it should not state otherwise. Just keep your OLD copies and forget this new package!!!"
1,Never received!,I ordered this for my great grandaughters Birthday. After several weeks I contacted shipper. First he said it had been mailed. Then he said thay had no more to ship!! VERY DISAPOINTING!
1,Delivery stinks,After ordering on 11/19 I am still waiting for it to be delivered!!In the future and item should not be sold if it can't be delivered in a timely fashion!!
1,Cinderella DVD,"My order was sent as a gift to my great-granddaughter, it arrived and the feature DVD of Cinderella was defective and unable to play. My grandson has written you about this and we have not received any satisfaction as of today. The extra video played just fine but the main gift item was the DVD of Cinderella. We are hoping for a refund from your company as Soffo is not responding. Betty Shaw"
1,Not happy.,"The delivery was VERY fast. We got the DVD about a week before they expected. However, it was NOT ""new"". There were no security sealings on the case which leads me to assume that it was opened. The wrapping on the case was not the original wrapping that comes on DVDs. It was a shrink wrap just like the kind we use at our college bookstore to wrap bundled textbooks. THEN, when we watched the movie, it was scratched. This was NOT a satisfying purchase. Be VERY careful when ordering this DVD."
2,Cinderella,"Was dissappointed with the condition of the Dvd, there are scratches on both Dvds and the spindle is broke on one side of the case, therefore the Dvd was loose in the case."
2,Difficulty with the display,"Not the best DVD (difficulty with formatting, and subtitles displaying). Also, has some skipping. I will keep shopping for a better version of this DVD."
5,Cinderella - Review,"Cinderella is a classic tale that will, and has, stood the test of time. You don't have to be a princess to enjoy this movie. My son gets a real kick out of watching the mice. As an adult, I appreciate the amount of time and effort (actual drawing) that it took to make this film (6 years!)."
5,Cinderella,"You can't go wrong with this classic! I got this for my grandkids and they love it. I loved it as a child and now as a grandma. This is my granddaughters favorite. I had to return this VHS for a DVD, it was a smooth transaction."
5,"Great film, great presentation","Cinderella is one of the classics, and it's great that it's finally available on Blu-ray.Ignore the reviews of those whining that this is not presented in 16 x 9. That's because it wasn't made that way! Go back to a ton of other moves of the era - they were also made in 1.33Disney has been doing a GREAT job with restoring and presenting their classics on Blu-ray, and I for one am THRILLED that they preserve the original aspect ratio. If I want to watch something in 16 x 9, I'll watch a current movie. If I want to watch a beloved classic, I want to see it the way I remember it, and the way it was originally presented.Very happy to have this in my collection alongside other great Disney classics on Blu-ray."
3,INSTANT VIDEO VERSION IS NOT WIDESCREEN,"GET THE BLU RAY DVD, THE INSTANT VIDEO VERSION IS NOT WIDESCREEN, IT HAS BLACK BARS ON THE SIDES, THE BLU RAY DVD IS AVAILABLE ON WIDE SCREEN FORMAT"
5,It is a classic!,It is just a classic. I appreciate what Walt Disney was able to do over and over again!! Will watch again!
5,Magicdal,"I really enjoy Disney movies, the animated ones the best. If you like animated movies, especially the hand drawn ones, this is the movie for you. It has more charm because it is all done by hand instead of on a computer.Cinderella was created a long time, the 1950's, a long time before there was computer assisted animation. It is still a magical movie. This is a great movie that follows the fairy tale exactly with some extras, e.g. the dialog scenes of her fairy godmother which adds to the charm of the movie that isn't included in the fairy tale.This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It is a movie that charms you & you are drawn into it because of its charm. You can tell right away who the good characters are & who the bad characters are.I would recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys movies that bring a smile to your face."
5,A stunning edition...,"Hi I am only a dad with four children, one being a 9 year old daughter. I only watched part of the movie, but the restoration is beautiful. The second disc has tons of extras this is a steal at the price. Also I highly recommend becoming a amazon prime member there is nothing like buying something and having it in 2 days. Many times they get it to me in ONE day. Amazon is a great place to buy and sell! But to the subject at hand, this item is highly recommended. Buy it for the kids and enjoy it yourself!That's it disney fans...enjoy!"
5,CINDERELLA,"Everything we expected in the movie. Great quality! If your daughter loves princesses, she will also enjoy the Tangled ever after short movie at the end as well."
5,Absolute fan favorite,This is one of the great Disney classics and was an excellent first Christmas dvd gift for my daughter. She is a big fan of the princesses and this is a must have for young toddler girls.
4,Great for the girls,"This is a great movie to have especially with a little girl growing up idolizing cinderella.The quality is good, and digital copy is just you need to load this to your Ipad"
5,Just another great Disney movie,"What else can I say? The title says it all. DVD works great, movie quality is wonderful. Great movie to watch with friends & family."
3,Cinderella DVD,I was disappointed in the presentation of the purchase. It came in a plain DVD holder with very small labeling. It is a gift so it will look shabby in presentation. I have yet to preview to be sure the condition is as stated.
5,Excellent!,It was unbelieveable how FAST I received this item after ordering it! I am very impressed with this product and the timeliness of its arrival. My grand daugther was here for a short visit and I am glad we could enjoy the video immediately! Thank you!
5,dvd,Can't say anything about Cinderella ... marvelous story that keeps my daughter watching for as long as you can imagine.
4,One of the best movies,I bought this for my daughter because Cinderella is her favorite princess. She loves this movie. She's watch it several times.
2,Disappointed,we had borrowed my sister's Cinderella for a road trip. My daughter fell in love with the movie. So I bought it only to have it not work. It keeps skipping or freezing. Because it's a dvd I can't take it back and am out the money. Now I have to buy another one. So what was $20 is now going to cost me $40
2,Not new,I ordered this DVD thinking it was new. It is not. Disc 1 is completely scratched all over. The movie skips periodically throughout the movie. Will not purchase from this seller again!
3,"Not ""like new""","I am glad to have this movie finally back in my collection, but it didn't arrive as it was described. It was supposed to be a ""like new"" product but the case was broken and missing pieces and the discs were pretty scuffed up. The description should be more accurate, so that people who may be looking for gifts know what they are getting. I was going to give this to my daughter as a gift, but due to it's condition I opted to just let her watch it now."
1,Strange aspect Ratio?,"Ok what is this it is not fullscreen or widescreen? I really hate this I have loved this movie since my VHS copy and this edition is aweful. First the disks are very cheeply made not like the previous versions with a nice label of the movie with a character and the aspect ratio is very confusing. I want to watch this movie in either wide screen or full and not in a box. It looks like the movie is being seen through a computer monitor. Why did Disney do this, If they continue to do this to classic movies I am not going to buy anymore DVD's from them not for $20 they are not worth it if I cannot see the whole screen or even wide screen."
4,approval,"I was satisfied with the product, however I never rate anything perfect because there is always room for improvement. The price was better than I had found in stores, even though I didn't need both Blu-ray and DVD. Thank you. It will be put to good use."
1,"Horrible customer service, and three weeks later, no movie","I ordered a movie from this company and it has been almost a month, and I have yet to receive it. I emailed them with an inquiry ten days ago, and never got a response. There is no way to track my order, and I cannot reach anyone by phone! I would not do business with these people!"
4,Cinderella,"A great story. Never happens in real life though. Great images, everything is very pretty. It's just one of those stories that we remember from our childhood. It's great to watch over and over again."
3,Cinderella dvd,I have not yet sent it to my grandchildren so I do not know how they like it. Will find out.
2,This is blu-ray?,4x3 format just didn't deliver movie experience. Very disappointing considering the premium paid for blu-ray. DVD would do just fine in this remaster.
3,Nothing special,"First of all, I don't know why people pay so much attention to the ""prejudices"" in the movie. This movie was made in the 50s, before the civil rights movement, so OF COURSE all of the characters would be white, that was the morality of the time, nothing surprising about it. A minority Cinderella wouldn't make much sense. The only downfall of the film is the cat and mouse game that takes up the good portion of the film and diverts its attention from Cinderella. THe prince's character is completele undeveloped, he has like 2 lines in it. The oscar winning song is rediculous. Overall, the movie does not go into the depth of the Cinderella story. But then again, it was made in the 50s in a G rating so that's as much as you can expect from a movie of the time. You want real deapth and character development and real problems, watch Beauty and the Beast. Now THAT's a masterpiece."
2,Go watch Shrek Instead,"I remember watching this as a child in the 70's and feeling a bit board...now as an adult I don't think the message is very healthy! Cinderella gives children the harmful impression that ""it pays to be pretty."" I don't think there are any positive messages in this film for young girls. I would recommend that you go out and rent Shrek instead."
1,It was Broken,"I haven't seen the movie in a long time, and i was excited to watch the movie, so i put it in the VHS player, and it wouldn't play, i tried putting in a different movie to see if it was the player but it was perfectly fine, so i hated this and i was mad and almost cried."
1,=(,"Cinderella is not one Disney's top best. Cinderella is also not a good princess she just and hopes things happen.She gives the message ""as long as youre pretty you don't have to be independent"".Totally different from Ariel who was the first indepent princess, she didn't wait for things to come to her, she acted on them & made them happen. Another example would be Belle. Get The Little Mermaid & Beauty & Beast they are far superior then Cinderella , they are ACADAMY award winners and Cinderella isnt ."
5,Classic!,How could you not love Cinderella? We have watched it over and over again. A classic that will always be treasured.
4,"Cinderelli, Cinderelli Night and day its Cinderelli.","This completes my families top 10 ranking of animated Disney movies. This movie was no ones favorite, but it scared no one and was liked by all 5 children. As the classic evil step-mother movie we see Cinderelli keep her good nature amidst adversity, and keep her humanity and love for the animals that befriend her.We had a lot of fun by gathering the family together to rank the 41 Disney movies we have that include some cartoon work. All the kids, ages 6 to 27, participated along with mother and dad. Peter Pan is no Codfish, we rank it #2. Lion King was selected number 1 of the 41 as the family favorite, but narrowly. Peter Pan was 2. Pete's Dragon 3, Beauty & the beast 4, Sleeping Beauty 5, Snow White 6, Robin Hood 7, 101 Dalmatians 8 and Fox and the hound 9."
3,Disapointed by the ending,"I know that this review will be considered sacrilige by some, but even as a little girl I was disapointed by this movie. Why? Because the film spends most of its length making you hate the wicked stepmother and stepsisters with a passion, and what happens to them in the end? Nothing! Not so much as a slap on the wrist! Now, I don't expect a children's cartoon to follow the Grimm's fairytale version (where the stepmother and sisters are blinded by doves,) but to just let the bad guys off the hook does not make a very satisfying story. In other classics like Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and Sleeping Beauty, the final battle with the antagonist is the most exciting part. No such excitement here. Sorry."
5,Princess,"Purchased for my 3 1/2 year old granddaughter, a Princess herself. I had taught her some of the songs myself so when they come on she sings right along with them. We will get years of enjoyment out of this gift."
5,Met expectations,"Bought this for a great granddaughter knowing she would love the animations as well as the wonderful colors, and I was so right on!"
5,"Wonderful, Slower-paced Classic",Our preschoolers love this show. The slower-pacing of the story line and conversation is great. The scenes with just music and the mice are favorites!
3,Kind of disappointed,"The slip cover was missing, and the disks were very dirty ): I was kind of disappointed with this purchase."
3,BLUE RAY,"HE REGULAR DISC WORKS FINE THE BLUE RAY DOES NOT, WHAT TO DO?????????????AT LEAST GOT TO WATCH IT. I CAN NOT FINE MY RECEIPT IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO?"
5,One of my favorites!,No one will go wrong purchasing this! The quality is excellent.It's wonderful to see favorite Disney movies restored and improved!
5,Love It!,"I originally went to Disneyland to buy this DVD but it was in ""the vault"" (what a load of crap). So I bought it here, and I couldn't be happier with my decision!"
5,Good,This is a fun movie that both my son and daughter enjoy. It's nice to have the classics available. It is not my favorite Disney movie but it's a nice one to own with some loveable animal characters. The quality of the film was good. I was surprised the movie was a smaller square visually when watching but it did not take away from the experience of the film. It was definitely worth the price we got it for.
3,For my daughter,It's just ok. I wasn't crazy about it but wanted my 3 year old daughter to see and she really likes it so that makes me happy.
3,only 3 stars,It's strange that CD was open and I didn't like it! It's present to my daughter hope it will work!
5,Great classic,My 3 yo loves this - it is wonderfully done - an excellent classic. Wouldn't change a thing about it except maybe make it a bit longer (somehow).
5,Walt Disney's Cinderella DVD,The DVD (Walt Disney's Cinderella Two Disc Special Edition) is the perfect adition to my classic Disney movie collection! I've always loved the story of Cinderella! This DVD will make any classic Disney Fan happy!
4,Cinderella Two - Disc Special Edition DVD,"This movie has brought great joy to my 3 year old ""Princess"". The case was broken when we received it but I had another one that worked just fine and we are glad to have this movie, in good condition, for our little granddaughter. She thanks you and we thank you."
5,Cinderella - Used Disc,"Bought it used - very good. When it came, I opened the box and thought I received a brand new disc. Beautiful animation and sound. Daughters loved it."
3,Blu-ray Glitch,"The quality is great once we get it to play. Most of the time we have to restart the blu-ray player several times before it reads it. Not sure if this is the player fault or the Blu-ray disk, but we do not have problems with other disks."
5,Cinderella Review,I loved this movie and the quality of the movie was great. I only saw the DVD portion but it came quickly and in great condition.
3,Cinderella,I think I was expecting a more up-to-date version of Cinderella. The old movie is great but wasn't as captivating as the more updated animated movies.
2,Disappointed,"Seller had DVD listed as ""mint condition"", this was not the case. I was embarrassed giving this scratched up disc as a gift!!!!"
4,A great movie for little kids!!!!!,"This is a great movie for little kids. There are plenty of songs, and leaves the child with great memories. Although its not the kind of movie you would want to watch over and over again, it is wonderful for watching with your family."
1,Blu ray,For some strange reason the Blu Ray disc does not work. It only appears the Disney castle at the beginning and never reads the play menu.The DVD though works just fine.Could it be that I live in Mexico?
1,NEVER GOT ITEM! NO CONTACT HORRIBLE SELLER!,Movie never came. Tried to contact seller twice! No response...Never recieved item...Never will buy from again!
1,Ruined a little girl's Christmas By Heather Landis,I ordered and paid for this in November and never received it. I contacted the seller who said to give him 48 hours to find a solution. That was the last I heard for him because he never responded to my numerous emails. Now a little girl did not get her special present and I have to dispute this purchase with my credit card.
1,Bad bootleg movie,"Whom ever copied this movie did a terrible job. This movie is not an original copy from Disney. When I took this dvd and compared it to all of my other Disney movies there are some distinct differences. The worst part of it is that all the movie does is skip from the beginning to the end. So I paid for a movie that cannot even be viewed, it stops throughout the entire movie, no matter the dvd player."
1,misled,"Unfortunatly, I placed this order with Amazon in the hopes I would receive 2 copies of Cinderella. I ordered and was charged for 2 movies, but so far I have only received 1. I am highly unlikely to ever do this again and I am very sad because so far, I have been cheated out of 23.90."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"The seller never sent this product nor did they ever try and respond to any of my numerous emails. I am extremely disappointed and my daughter was heartbroken because this was suppose to be her 3rd birthday present. I then had to purchase from another seller who was able to deliver the movie in Fantastic condition and within a week. I connacted Amazon to let them know of my situation and they made sure to return my purchase amount very quickly and said that that were very sorry for my interaction--or there lack of-- with this seller. I also found out that they, the seller, had numerous unhappy buyers after I made my purchase who were also requesting refunds and were very disappointed with their interaction with this seller. I have been and will continue to buy from Amazon in the future but not from anyone with less then 3000 sales and not less then 98% rating."
1,Damaged Disk,Disc was delivered to me with a defect. It skips when we get to the same spot everytime. Very disappointed.
5,VHS Dead long live the DVD,Purchased this for my grown daughter - VHS just doesn't cut it - by the time a new format comes out - she'll have to buy her own
3,Timeless Tale,"Given as a gift to a three year old granddaughter. Timeless theme of good versus ""evil"" in a great story."
5,Cinderella Special Edition DVD,"This is a magnificent movie and it really captures one's heart its a movie that really grabs and immerses you. I loved this movie, it was awesome. The one thing that I would have liked to know before I purchased it, though is why would you sell it at $24.99 for a used DVD? That was one thing I would have liked to known. I would have sold it for like $9.99. Oh well worth the money."
4,Satisfied with order,The movie did not play well in my regular dvd player; however it played excellent in my blue ray player. For this reason the seller was willing to return my payment and not charge me for the DVD and allowed me to replace it or not. I appreciate his willingness to make this transaction good.
5,Cinderella DVD,I purchased this DVD for my granddaughter's birthday and she loved it! The vendor shipped it promptly upon receipt of the order and it was received on time.
2,Can't get the blu ray disc to play in my blu ray player,I have had other blu ray discs. I don't know why this one doesn't work and truly don't have time to contact technical support. I shouldn't have. I play the regular disc instead. I will not buy another combo pack as I see no reason if one of the discs does not function properly. I am disappointed in the product and do not feel like I want ot consume my energy figuring out why it doesn't work or sending it back. Lesson learned. At least in store I could just return it.
5,Classic,I love Cinderella. It is a great Disney classic and the quality of this Blu-ray DVD is superb. A wonderful addition to my collection.
3,Childhood Memories!,"I still catch myself waking up with the infamous ""a dream is a wish your heart makes"" in my head. I've watched Cinder Ella for years now and it never ceases to make me smile! =)"
5,The best cartoon ever!!!!!!!,This is my favorite cartoon of all time. I especially liked the mice....a classic tale told in an exquisite manner.
3,Classic,"Disney promises to give you a crisp remastering of these classic movies. The sound is the best it's ever been and there are always behind the scenes extras with animators or producers. I'd like to see the Disney Dali movie out on Blu-Ray as part of an Extra or something phenomenal, ty"
4,Classic,Had to have it; 1)It's one of my wife's favorite; 2)can't go wrong with Disney and 3) i have a neice that is a princess.
4,"Great original, building collection for daughters",Not sure I needed the blu ray. Not much different than DVD for obvious reasons. Great sound and love having the digital copy for them for long trips. I make sure to always buy the movies with digital copy for that reason.
3,Freezing Screen,I chose this rating -- not for the movie it is marvelous but the streaming -- the movie kept freezing and my 4 year old niece was most upset!
5,Boys will like it too!!!!,"I got this from the library, just to see if my son would like it. We haven't even watched the extras, but my 3 year old boy just loved it. He has watched it 6 times and we can only have it for a week before it has to go back. It is a timeless tale with many pop. culture references. He loved it because of all the animals Cinderella befriended. It is well restored and a great entertaining G rated story. Good for boys and girls!"
5,loved it,"my daughter wanted a bunch of Disney movies for her college dorm, this was one on her list she enjoyed the movie"
3,Disappointing,"I wasn't really interested in Cinderella, I only bought this for Tangled Ever After. Both were disappointing. I remember seeing Cinderella as a child and thought it was OK but really preferred Sleeping Beauty and Beauty & The Beast. Seeing it again now as an adult, compared to those 2 movies this looks more like a cartoon for little girls. Simplified and cutesy. And the Tangled short was way too short with almost no Flynn in it at all. So, also a big disappointment. I hope they make a Tangled 2."
2,yawn,"typically, whether i like to admit it or not, i enjoy the older disney animated features. this film is definitely an exception to the rule. the first 15-20 minutes are primarily devoted to the mice. 5 minutes of this would've been more than enough. in fact, the mice pretty much dominated most of the action in this cartoon. cinderella is an absolute pushover, her character is silly and flat.the film does however follow the story closely: the fairy godmother, the wicked stepmother, the glass slipper. this does not save the film, and halfway through i found myself enduring it just to see it through."
1,Cinderella,Was told by Disney this is NOT an authorized product of Disney!Main DVD will NOT play on my DVD player (only on my PC).Received NO response from distributor for refund & return policy after two e-mail requests.BAD PURCHASE!
1,Item does not come as advertised,"If you are looking for cinderella with the slip cover limited case it will not come with it. it is only the dvd case, the slip cover and everything in the pictures is NOT included. Don't be fooled by this FALSE ADVERTISING."
1,Not original,I purchased this DVD because the info said it was like a brand new copy. When I gave it to my girldfriend for her birthday I was mortified to discover that the first disc was not the original but a copy of the original. Even though the disc had a printed image on the disc I can tell it's a copy because on the back side you can see where the movie didn't use the disc space. When played the movie was good quality but there wasnt a menu screen like on original DVDs it had a homemade menu track 1 screen. Will never buy from this seller again.
1,Cinderella,This was a rip-off! It came in a square plastic DVD sleeve with no printed cover...not in the rectangle case that they come in it they come from a store.
1,ripped off,"I am frustrated and extremely angry with this dealer, I placed this order Dec.31 2008. Please understand my bank account was debited on Jan 5th. After ample time elapsed I inquired..Where is my merchandise? A few more weeks...again an inquiry..where is my merchandise? And yet no merchandise and NO reply after polite inquiries. Fine, if its held up just keep me in the loop but nothing. So here we are in Feb and again I put out a request to cancel the order but have no reply. And being such a sucker and using an outside vendor Amazon cannot help me recoup my loss. By now it's more than the money it's the principle of it. So if you are considering using this vendor DON'T!! I suppose this is the best recourse I have. At least it may help someone else. (Actually is 0 stars but the system wouldn't take it.)"
1,what movie?,I wish I had gotten the movie. I received an email on the day that the package was due that it has been refunded...no other explaination.
1,Cinderella Dvd,"Cinderella Dvd does not work,I am very unhappy with the DVD & I would like to return it.Please give me an address where I can mail it.Thank You,"
1,Don't throw your VHS copy away just yet!!!,"Why did Disney decide to change Cinderella's dress color from silver to blue? The answer is $MARKETING$!! They market Cinderella in a blue dress when the original color was a silver. I turned back and forth from the VHS and the DVD. Disney not only lost the original color of the dress during the ball and the escape from the ball scenes, but also lost the quality! Her dress was more detailed and sparkled more in the original silver color. The DVD makes her dress look like they painted by number!!! I am very upset!!!!"
3,Not worth getting on BD,"It might say WIDESCREEN, but it isn't. After awhile it didn't bother me as much, but I wasn't happy at all when I popped it in the first time. Also, Disney is trying to pass off a commercial for Disneyworld as a ""bonus feature"". There was some Louboutin short with him designing a shoe... Uhm, I guess that is relevant? If you already have this movie, there is no reason to upgrade to Blu-ray. If you don't, save the money and get it on standard def."
4,Little girls love princess stories.,"Evil Stepmother, Fairy Godmother, Shoes, Prince, Dance etc... There is something in here for just about any little girl to relate to."
4,Satisfied with customer service,The DVD was a dud. HOWEVER...I emailed providers and a response was given the very same day with their apologies and would refund money. The very next day money was issued to my account for a refund! There was no hassle. So will look to buy from these providers again they were true to their word and It is very much appreciated! Thank you!
3,So So,I bought a used Cinderella DVD. It worked fine. The cover seemed like copy paper. It did not have a barcode. Decent Shipping.
4,Great,"I thought I had posted a review already but will be glad to do it again. I bought a 2 part DVD but only received one from TMI, but they made the problem right by giving me half off. So thought was fair. the product is ver good and so isn't the service. Would be business with you again. Thanks. BJV"
5,Cinderella,"This item (requested by my granddaughter for Christmas) was out of stock at the Disney Store (apparently they call it ""in the Vault"") and was not available at Target or any of the major stores. I found it at Amazon and it arrived in good time and perfect condition.Very pleased with the product and service."
4,Better than expected,This item ordered was for my mother-in-law. I didn't expect the item to come so neatly packaged and ready for a present. Very classy and surprising.
4,Kid favorite,We bought this for my 4 year old daughter that loves Cinderella.It is the same Disney classic that we are all familiar with and is exactly what we expected.
5,Classic memories now in 1080p !,A Classic Disney movie now in beautiful 1080p display. Can't get better than this. Also includes a never before opening sequence scene. Uploaded the digital copy on to my computer and transferd it on to my iPod so I can have it with me everywhere I go =)
3,Xmas Gift,It a Xmas gift and not sure if they will like it or not. have to wait and see if they like it.
5,christmas gift,very niceQuick shippingthis is a christmas gift for my daughter and she will absolutely love it. She loves all of the princesses.
5,An excellent release of an old favorite,"One of Disney's crown achievements. This version is greatly enhanced. It is a pleasure to watch, and the special features, including live interviews of the stars, make this a must have for any collection."
3,Cinderella Diamond Edition DVD/BluRay,"The quality of the set is very good, but if you don't have a BluRay player you get penalized by not being able to view extras, which is very disappointing"
5,Classic!,We're happy to have this as part of our Disney collection. It's a fun family movie that we've had on VHS and enjoy being able to watch on DVD.
5,Exactly as Presented!,Great product! Brand new and just as I remembered it as a child. Perfect to pass on to new generation!
5,Finally!,"I think Disney is ridiculous for only releasing their hits every 5-7 years, but I'm glad to finally have Cinderella. We bought the stand alone DVD and an electronic copy on iTunes."
5,Great classic,My kids love it and so does my wife. It is a classic. A nice basic disc for those wanting to enjoy this movie on DVD.
3,No French Soundtrack on the Kindle Version,I had this on DVD and decided to buy the Kindle version as well. Unfortunately the Kindle version doesn't have the French soundtrack that I enjoyed and continue to enjoy on the DVD. Amazon should let buyer's know that what they're getting for the kindle will be missing features available on the DVD version.
3,NOT AN ORGININAL....,I WANTED TO CHECK WITH ANOTHER FRIEND WHOM HAS THE ORRIGINAL CINDERELLAAND THE COLOR IS DIFFERENT ...ALSO A SCRATCH ON THE CD.COULDNT CONTACT THESELLER..WAS SENT NO PAPERS WITH THE CD..SO ALITTLE UNSETING
3,Be careful who you order from!!,I will never buy a movie from Amazon sellers after receiving a black market copy... I will only buy from Amazon itself!
5,Brings back great memories,"My boyfriend gave me this movie as a gift, I loved it so much I had to get one for my daughter. I just had to have one for myself. It brings back great memories.The color and sound are wonderful."
5,"Arrived in great condition, ahead of schedule","The product arrived in original packaging, as advertised, and a couple weeks ahead of schedule (although since I ordered it to Canada there was always the chance it could get held up at the border). Overall a very good shopping experience."
5,Perfect seller.,"Excellent. DVD was wrapped like new, Fast delivery, great product, would ABSOLUTELY recommend this seller and will buy from them again in a heart beat should the need arise!"
5,Enhanced Version is AMAZING! Walt would be proud!,"Very beautiful enhancement of this timeless classic! I loved every minute of it. The colors are sharp and the sound like crystal! I bought this for my 3-year-old granddaughter for Christmas. I watched it first to make sure the DVD was in excellent condition (and wanted a sneak preview!) ha-ha! My little Heidi will be enamored with it! I can see her baby blue's lit up now. Don't be afraid to purchase this enhanced DVD. I don't care what another reviewer had to say about this versus the original - this is fabulous! They worked with what they had back in the day, and they would have loved to have had the ability to produce a Cinderella as marvelous as this. Enjoy!"
2,Movie ok,"Ok, so this item was rated ""very good,"" and that was not necessarily the case. So far, the video itself has played ok, but the VHS cartridge was in poor shape, and the box was cracked and in quite poor shape. Not quite ""very good"" if you ask me, as the product that is shipped is more than just the VHS, it is the whole presentation."
3,Good,I received my DVD quickly but it was loose in the case and was somewhat scratched. If there is a way to secure the DVD inside the case please attempt in the future
2,Honest--yes. Painful--YES,"In concluding her introduction, Ms. Zeidenstein says this about her anthology: ""I am struck by the fact that these are all primarily love poems. There is little despair here"" and adds, ""...these poems are comforting."" This seems ironic to my narrow mind since she opens her introduction despondent over her daughter's separation which leaves her ""feeling paralysed in despair"" and, ""Nothing ripens. I am a wasp sucked dry."" The large majority of the collected poems conveyed to me this same sense of remorse, guilt and anguish, perhaps ""comforting"" to some who share similar trials. My fault, I couldn't relate. I was seeking to add to the inspiration, beauty and celebration that had just come from our family reunion. I found it in two other books from Amazon: Good Poems--Garrison Keilor and Wedding Blessings--June Cotner"
2,I Truly Gave It A Fair Shake,"Dreadful! And not in a good way! I tend not to like latter-day Holmesian stories of this stripe, but I truly read this one with an open heart and again and again I cringed and shook my head at one mistake after another. How anyone can claim to be an authority on the Holmes canon---and what's worse, be called an authority---and commit all the blatant errors in fact and principle this author does is stunning. For every mildly interesting bit presented in this hackish abomination, there were untold aggravations and blasphemies. Plus, balls, it's not even that good of a book. Don't waste your time here. Read or re-read one of the originals!After a baby ""spilt"" juice all over it, hopelessly ruining it, I had my friend shoot The Seven-Per-Cent Solution with my grandpa's WWII-era M1. An execution it richly deserved. May it rest in pieces!"
2,"Weak plot, a travesty to the canon","This book betrays the Sherlock Holmes people know and respect. In this tale, Holmes is reduced to a semi-deranged cocaine addict in desperate need of mental help.The amount of plot in this book is about the same as one of Doyle's short stories. A tacked-on chase sequence at the end seems out of place, but since the author is a screenwriter, it is perhaps not surprising.But the worst of all is this, revealed right at the start of the book: Professor Moriarty, Holmes' most dangerous enemy in the real stories, is reduced here to a meek, ordinary schoolteacher. What a ridiculous and depressing idea! I kept waiting for the real Moriarty to show up, but no. Meyer's Holmes has no brilliant enemy to challenge him, just a boring cocaine addiction. I am surprised the owners of the Sherlock Holmes trademark approved this book."
4,Pretty good.,"The mystery was kind of sparse, sort of tacked on at the end. The story was more about hanging around and worrying over Holmes' cocaine habit, interspersed with some ""look, it's Sigmund Freud, isn't he cool?"" for a change of pace. Well, yes, he is cool, but as much as I like Holmes and Watson, and as well-written as they are here, the story was a touch uneventful. Still, if anyone could make boring fun, it's these two.The West End Horror is a better book by the same author, but I don't regret paying $5 for this one. It was rather quiet, but it was also an interesting character study of Holmes."
4,The Game 's Afoot,"I was quite pleased with the book, being an actual reprint of the original one published in the 70's, which I had read before purchasing this copy. However, my feelings are kind of mixed, because Meyer 'edited' Watson's original work of the ending, matching it up to one of the plot devices that was used in the movie of the same name. I don't really know what to think of it, as it makes it clearer than the original version, but still - why make it coincide with the movie?Besides that, I love the journey of Sherlock Holmes through his rehab period, and the interaction between Freud and Holmes is entertaining and, despite Holmes's behavior in the original canon, quite human. Even if you have never read any Sherlock Holmes, here is a good springboard to get you started into the adventures of the world's greatest consulting detective."
3,Elementary?,"This novel wasn't quite the knockout its cover blurbs promised, but it remains a fairly entertaining bit of literary ledgerdemain.Dr. John Watson, now established and married, is visited by his erstwhile companion in crime-solving, Sherlock Holmes, who rants and raves about being stalked by his old math teacher. Moriarity. Watson soon discovers that Holmes is delusional due to his cocaine addiction. Eventually he enlists the aid of famed psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. However, Holmes's addiction is the least of their problems. The trio fall into a mystery whose ramifications could mean the very destruction of the world itself.I think it is the artificially antique prose style that prevented me from falling in love with this novel. It sounds too much like one author aping the voice of another, and the result is a little less than convincing. It is all too earnest. Had Meyer taken Watson's voice in a slightly different direction, then this might truly have been special and memorable."
5,The best of the pseudo-Holmeses,"What I truly admire in this book is how it deftly explains the improbable Moriarty of the original tales with an unexpected yet plausible twist - the sort of twist that every mystery story should have, though set at the beginning of the book rather than the more traditional end. The plot is more compelling than the later 'Canary Trainer' and the characters more believable within the context of Doyle's world."
4,Highly Recommended,"I enjoyed this more than I expected: the entire premise of Freud vs Holmes seemed ridiculous, but the author makes it work fantastically. It's fascinating to imagine an alternate reality on Moriarty, and I was provoked with real sympathy for Holmes' unhealthy addiction. If you've read the canons & have a craving for more Holmes, this is HIGHLY recommended over any other Holmes ""fan-written"" books."
4,Longman Pronunciation Dictionary,"This book is a must for everyone seriously interested in English pronunciation. This book shows the pronunciation of what might be typically used by newscasters. However, the idea that a person can learn to speak 'good English' is insulting to millions of people who are very proud of their own regional dialects, which may be considered by non-native speakers of English as 'bad'. If you want to learn to speak 'good' English, hop in a time machine and go back to a time when 'standards' were more severely enforced. (Say, Axis countries in the late thirties.)"
5,"Great gun, it's almost too good...","[Penny's son...]This gun is fantastic for the price, it looks and feels great, and comes with everything you need to play with it right out of the box. It doesn't have any of the fancy accesories, but those are pretty much useless unless you want a heavier, more visible gun.The rate of fire is very high, but spare magazines are very hard to find(and then expensive), I'm actually buying another gun to use it for spare mag/ parts.BUY MORE SPEED LOADERS. It's not really a choice if you want to use it in a war of any kind, you NEED speed loaders. It comes with one, but it's fragile, I had to tape the end to keep it from splitting in two while loading the magazine."
5,nice looking gun,"I don't play airsoft game. I just need a nice toy gun to goof around. When I got this, I was pleasantly surprised. For $20, I thought it would be made of cheap plastic and would not weigh much. On the opposite, the plastic does not look cheap at all. There is decent weight to this thing when fully assembled. The workmanship is not flawless, but for $20, I am more than happy.There is one difference from the photo posted here : the fire suppresser or the tip is orange, not black as in the photo."
4,This g36 is pretty good,"Alright so this gun is pretty good. I bought this gun for my bunker I built (yah I'm crazy)and when I got it, I charged up the battery, loaded it and went outside to shoot it.I was AMAZED at the rpm (round per minute). I have almost a $100 airsoft gun, and yet this gun has better rpm. But if you don't want to use up the mag so quickly, don't but this gun, or buy this gun and use semi so it takes longer to use the bb's. I would recommend buying extra mags for this gun, just don't buy the mags that say they are from DE, they don't fit (don't ask me how I know that.) Also the range was pretty good for a cheap gun goes 10ft. farther than my $40 gun. (it goes about 30ft w/ .12g 6mm bb)"
1,did not come with anything,this is a good lookin gun but with out a battry come on know this is bull
5,Prepare to dominate with this!,"This is an entry level gun, but worth the money. It looks just like the real one, is very sturdy, and easy to shoot. The range is pretty good for the price, and it hurts even on a low battery."
3,Recomendation,"I got this for my son, and he complained about the short battery life. So we would recommend that you buy another battery"
5,Cool gun!! recomended for all!,"well i got this gun and tested it out, right off the bat. Awesome fire rate and doesnt do to much damage but is good for fun, thats how my soni playoverall awesome but could do with a better mag"
2,What a pain,Good looking rifle but it only holds 30 pellets. You go through that in a couple seconds on full-auto then have to reload and it's a big pain to reload all the time. My son doesn't even use in now because of that.
3,Not the best,"I ordered the gun on november 30th with ONE DAY SHIPPING. I got it december 4th. the shipping is horrible. So i was dissapointed... Then i got the gun. Overall, the gun is great."
3,"[Three-and-a-half stars] Could have been better without all the gossip...ET, anyone?","Author Kriegel does a very average jobof stretching this overrated book out.Sure I like the greatest player in AFLhistory. [I highly recommend getting'History of the AFL' video (sorry, VHSonly) from here at amazon.com as well...]But this book is like watching paint dryto get through. Next time I'll read anArthur Butz or Walt Sanning book insteadfor more light-hearted reading. Seriously,I did learn a lot from it, but....DO YOUthink you can be more vulgar next time, K?"
3,For the Serious Namath Fan,"It was OK - the Super Bowl season and the seasons leading up to it were well written and really kept you interested. The years afterwards, there was too much unrelated material making it difficult to stay foucsed on the real story. Namath was an incredibly, lucky guy who seemed to always be in the right place at the right time and the story paints this picture. A bit too long though."
3,Big Book About a Big Star,"Kriegel does a masterful job at covering Namath for the reader. That said, I found the book way too long for the subject matter. Definitely mainline skimming after Namath retires from the Jets. The author really covers Namath's flaws. He appears to have always been an industrial strength drinker with little regard for most of his teammates and others. Not an easy person to like. Consequently, I found myself asking why am I reading all of these words about such a person. The football parts are really good, especially I would think for old line Jets fans. However, other parts are less intriguing. I've noticed that authors who are also journalists tend to think we care as much about all the details as do they. I found Kriegel's book, Pistol, about Pete Maravich is a better read."
2,Poorly written tome,"Unlike some of the other reviews, I will be brief. This is a very poorly written book, subjecting the reader to superfluous information about irrelevant people. I love a good biography about those people who have had a significant impact on our culture, and Joe Namath certainly fills that slot. He was the manifestation of the '60s for many of us, taking chances to express himself without apology and, often, without an audience. However, this book is about all of the other people who crossed through his life, many peripherals who simply do not matter, and who fill space without adding to the story. Why should we be subjected to the life histories of people on the fringes, and why can we not simply focus on the true impact of this man? Do not buy this book - there are better bios to read that will not bore you to tears."
5,Namath-A Biography by Kriegel,"Joe Namath is an Hungarian born athlete. He was raised from modest beginnings. As an athlete, he was talented from the outset. His school grades did not reflect his full potential and he scared off college scouts initially.Ultimately, the Jets drafted him and he performedspectacularly in the 1969 Superbowl of Champions. The lateHoward Cosell was a frequent house guest. In the early 1980s,Joe took singing lessons and continued his rise in both sports and the media. The book is a treasure for sports enthusiastseverywhere. It does justice to Joe's continued rise in footballand the entertainment world. The volume is written in theeasygoing belles lettres literary style. It is an importantacquisition for anyone interested in the meteoric rise of thesuperstar- Joe Namath."
1,Needs editing,"I thought this book was going to be all about Namath, but there is way too much football history.Wished the history would have been edited and and the book had stuck to Namath."
4,"Brilliant melding of psychology, family, culture","I couldn't put this book down until I finished it. The author brilliantly weaves together Joe Namath's family background, socioeconomic circumstances, culture and football to clearly and movingly explain this complex hero and possibly unwitting revolutionary. I am thrilled that there is a biography that does justice to the great Joe Namath."
4,Cheers for # 12,"I enjoy biographies, not just sports but any lively individual. Joe Namath was a gifted athlete and an American phenomonon. The author has captured Mr. Namaths glory days and then some. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Chances are you would too."
3,Not what I wanted to hear about Broadway Joe.,"I grew up in California with Joe Namath as my idol. I read ""I can't wait until tomorrow...."" dozens of times. I still have his poster that hung on my bedroom wall from high school through college.This is not a book for fans (like me) of the Broadway Joe of our memories. It inconveniently/disappointingly describes the selfish, inconsiderate, flawed Namath which is natural for a human being but undesirable in idol worship. While I am glad I read the book, I will not read it again. The book is great if you want to know the real person of Joe Namath but not enjoyable for hardcore fans."
5,"Outstanding biography on Namath, the man","Lots of pertinent insight on his early life and how it formed him as a young adult.I actually felt sorry for him, as the author revealed the hurts, fears, and sorrows that affected him in his life."
2,Dog Still Chewing Carpet!,"After using the bitter apple on the oriental area rug in our bedroom and spraying the carpet twice, our dog was caught still chewing on the carpet. Unfortunately, this product did not work for us at all."
3,Not long lasting,I was amazed at first with this product. My dog hated the stuff I sprayed with it. Although it fades quickly apparently because soon after she went right back to chewing it. I guess you have to keep spraying it over and over again.
3,Works when it's wet,"This works right after you spray it but once it's dried it pretty much loses all effectiveness. My dog will taste it and realizes that it's bitter, walks away but he'll come back to bite later once it's already dried."
3,Does what it's supposed to,"I bought this for my German Shepherd who couldn't seem to keep his mouth off of things. When I first sprayed it on an object my dog wanted to chew, he tried licking it, confused at the taste. He eventually left it alone. However, he came back around 10 minutes later and decided that he could tolerate the taste. I simply sprayed on more, and he finally left it alone. If you don't mind having to spray this on more than once, it can definitely help."
3,Its OK,"It works for a couple of days but you have to constantly re-apply otherwise they will begin biting again. I have two dachshunds and they love the baseboards, they stop as soon as I spray it but after a couple of days they go at it again."
4,chew remedy,"Grannicks Bitter Apple spray works. I spray it on my couch, chairs, wooden furniture, etc. My pitbull loves to chew everything when we're not home. We tried other products like this one but it didn't work. I remembered this one working for my other dog so we tried it and it's great. She doesn't chew anything we spray it on. The only down-side to this product is that it wears off pretty fast so every time we leave the house, we have to spray it again. I guess that's how they get you to keep buying more. Hopefully she grows out of this chewing stage but until then, I guess we'll be using this Bitter Apple spray!"
1,Did not work to stop chewing,"This stuff did not stop my pet from chewing. I actually tasted it to see how bitter it is -- alas, it's relatively mild. Methinks a more concentrated bitter apple might work -- less fillers like alcohol and more of the essential bitter apple flavor. Perhaps I'll try cooking it to reduce the volume and intensify the flavor . . . . Meanwhile I'll continue the search. If anyone finds something more effective please post a reply."
3,"Works sometimes, but not when the puppy is determined...","It works in cases where my lab puppy casually chews on things, but if he's really interested in something (like his leash) it doesn't make much of a difference."
4,works but may not work,My dog has a problem chewing on easily accessible items when he is bored. I spray some of the apple deterrent on the items and i haven't seen him go back to chump some more. However it may just be cause i cant catch him. Also i drenched one of his toys in the product to see if he wouldnt chew it. he chewed it but he did not look like he was enjoying it though. good but not that strong. a very mildly sour taste.
2,Didn't Work for My Puppy,"This wasn't a deterrent for my pit bull puppy, who chewed on everything in sight in spite of my using Bitter Apple. I think the biggest drawback is that it dries out too fast, thus quickly losing any effectiveness. Once she moved past the crazy puppy stage into reward- and praise-based obedience training, the command ""leave it"" gives me the positive result I was looking for."
2,Did not make any difference.,"My dog does not care if this stuff smells bad to humans, apparently it is not offensive enough to deter his behavior."
2,Not Bitter Enough,"This product didn't seem to work for me. I have two 1 year old Siamese Cats, sprayed my rugs completely, and they still continue to chew, tear, and lift my rugs just as they did before I sprayed them. Possibly there is a better product that is specific for cats out there, haven't found it yet."
4,I think it worked,"I have to honestly say, I am not really sure if this works. When our dog was a puppy he really did not chew on anything except what we gave him. We were very lucky! The only thing that he put his teeth on were my sandals, and it drove me nuts! Every time I would turn around, he would be carrying my shoe in his mouth. At first it was cute, but I gradually grew to dislike it. So, I decided to give this a shot. It was cheap, and it got great reviews from people. I put some this on my sandal, and guess what. He stopped picking up my sandal! I have not had to use this on anything else though, so I can not say if it works on other objects. As to my sandal, he no longer even thinks of taking it."
4,Works well,"I have used Grannicks Bitter Apple spray since my two miniature schnauzers were little guys that chewed on anything and everything. I still use Grannicks even though my guys are now approaching adulthood. They associate the smell with ""no."" A spray or two will get the job done and is not an unpleasant smell to humans."
3,"It Works, with Reservations","I used to use this product many years ago on my dog who had lick granuloma, and it didn't work at all, but in desperation I bought some more for my cat who has a terrible chewing problem.This product does seem to work but you must be sure to shake it well and pretty heavily coat the item that the animal likes to chew. This can be a major problem when the animal (like mine) likes to chew things like paper, cardboard, books and photos. On top of that, the effect wears off fairly quickly and you have to re-apply it every 3-4 hours, otherwise it's back to business with the chewing.It has no smell at all and at first I thought it didn't work, until I figured out that you really have to get the surface wet and shake it quite a bit before spraying. So it's not the perfect solution, but until I can convince this cat with something else, I guess I'll be re-ordering this."
4,Works best when freshly applied,"I actually got this to train our new kittens to not chew electrical cables. They liked to chew on my laptop power cord, and my cellphone charging cord.Its pretty effective when recently applied, but doesn't seem to work as well after it's dried. Either way, after tasting it once, neither cat will chew on the cords any more. We're also applying it to the AV cables that lead to/from our TV and cable box. Thus far, no chew marks."
3,"Works when wet and with a stern ""No""","Our puppy seems to strongly dislike the flavor of this stuff, but only while damp. Once it dries, it might as well not be there. We have had pretty good success pairing a spritz of this stuff with a strong ""no."" With so many other things to chew on, it's just enough discouragement to keep him from going back to the curtains."
2,This didn't work for my dog,I was hoping to use this as a deterrent for my puppy chewing on inappropriate things but it doesn't seem to work. The label on the bottle is different than some of the descriptions I read before purchasing this item.
1,Doesn't work,Maybe I have a bad bottle or something but I can't tell that my dogs mind it all. I tasted it myself and didn't find it very objectionable. I do not recommend this product at all.
3,don't know if it has worked,"I only rate it a 3 cause I'm not sure it has worked to it's full potential.I bought so my rat would stop chewing on the things that aren't hers, I think it may have worked but I'm just not sure."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T BUY THE PRODUCT FROM AMAZON, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD DEED TO PROVIDE A REVIEW. THIS PRODUCT IS WORTHLESS. OUR 16 WEEK OLD YORKIEPOO IS NOT THE LEAST BIT TURNED OFF BY IT. SHE MUST THINK IT'S WATER OR SOMETHING. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT, AND OVER THE YEARS, NATURE'S MIRACLE PRODUCTS, HAS BEEN THAT THEY ARE ALL A RIP OFF, AND FAIL TO PERFORM AS ADVERTISED. JUST ANOTHER PRODUCT FOR SALE TO SEPARATE PET OWNERS FROM THEIR MONEY. SO SAVE YOUR MONEY; STAY AWAY FROM THESE PRODUCTS AND THEIR OUTRAGEOUS CLAIMS."
4,The only way it consistently works...,Our dog trainer recommends using Grannick's but you must put a spray inside the dog's lip when you spray it on furniture. Then the dog remembers the intensity of that experience next time he even faintly tastes it. It works much longer that way. The real fix is to always crate your puppy when out of your view.
4,Very Good Product Offered for a Good Price on Amazon,"Grannick's Bitter Apple was designed to stop puppies from chewing things that you don't want them to chew (electrical cords, sneakers, the carpet etc.) It worked pretty well with my puppy and was not harmful to the dog in any way. It does wear off most surfaces after a couple of hours so you will need to re-spray some of your dog's favorite targets. But I found that when I kept spraying certain items the dog would eventually remember that these items didn't taste very good and leave them alone. The price that it is offered for here on Amazon is more than a 50% discount over the price I got it for at PetSmart. It's really a great deal. On the whole, the product isn't perfect but it is an invaluable aid in training your puppy. If your bringing a puupy home soon I would recommend that you buy a bottle of this here on Amazon."
1,"Dog liked it, it made her sick","I tried this yesterday because it was cheap and recommended to me by many. Unfortunately my dog happily licked it up as soon as I sprayed it on anything. I hid her and sprayed it while she wasn't looking and then she licked it all off everything I didn't want her to chew. About an hour later, she threw up everything in her stomach. Another hour after that she was retching again because this stuff made her sick. I returned it to the store I got it from. It may work for some people, so take my review with a grain of salt, but it did not work for our German Shepherd puppy."
2,Free if you want it-you pay the postage!,I got this in today's deliveries. Applied to my lickie lickie dog.....yup it's VERY bitter...I got some (unbeknownst to me)on my hand and ultimately in my OWN mouth!! It's awful!!!6 hours later---the dog has sopping wet feet as she licks them to DEATH. This stuff didn't even work for one day--not at all...she was so intent on licking she didn't even see me approaching!Back to the drawing board!
3,"Works, but can spread very easily","This works to keep a pet off of things, but it very easily transfers to your fingers from the pet, and/or furniture. So it's good for table legs, and things you are not likely to touch, but not as good for the arms of a couch. If you put your hand on it, you will very likely taste it at some point later in the day.That said, the dog seems to tolerate it well. It deters him, but does not seem to irritate him or make him avoid things other than chewing."
3,Works... sometimes,"This product seems to only work when it's still wet. After it has dried, it has no effect. I own a pitbull pup and she will avoid it like the plague until it dries, and then it's like it's not even there. Regardless, it's worth the price."
2,very slow,"This printer is horrifically slow on all but the basic setting. Click on ""better"", or heaven forbid ""best"" quality (which still isn't so fantastic) and you will be waiting, and waiting, and waiting for you paper--try printing a 50 page document and you may as well go out for coffee. By the way, I'm talking Black and White, not color, in which case you may as well go to bed and get your document in the morning. It is small, which is a plus (and hey, for us it came free with another computer). I keep mine in the kitchen for laptop use. But for any serious printing, I have to use my HP."
3,not a happy camper,"upon receiving the book, knew it would not be perfect. im o.k. with that. the thing i wasnt o.k. about was the small little red bugs inside the book when you opened it started crawling. didnt like that. other than that its o.k. i havent open it anymore."
3,Very Best of D O'Donnell,"This was a gift for my husband who enjoys the Irish music, but was disappointed in this cd because most of it is country music. It definitely was NOT his very best!"
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Though a brief description of the plot (a desperate scheme to assassinate Churchill) might make the Eagle Has Landed seem silly or obvious, the movie is in fact a skillful and fast-moving thriller that is well-worth watching."
2,more of a love story than a war film,"Apart from one decent battle scene at the conclusion of the film, 'The eagle has landed'really does not make the cut in my oppinon. For starters, the storyline is pointless and the majority of acting is not much better. If not for Michael Caine the movie wouldnt have had half the success it did .. Perhaps i am picky but this is only second rate film (at best) in all areas and does not exist in my video collection."
1,THE EAGEL HAS LANDED[SECOND COPY],"THIS COPY IS DAMAGED AS WELL THE FIRST ONE WE RETURNED.IT SKIPS,MY HUSBAND WAS SO UPSET HE JUST TRASHED IT."
4,Above average adaptation of Jack Higgins's book,"This version of the Jack Higgins book isn't bad. Fine performances by a varied cast: including, a steely-eyed Michael Caine; a cocky Donald Sutherland; a mysterious Robert Duvall, and the alway eerie Donald Pleasance, as well as a ""nasty"" turn by Jean Marsh, as a sympathetic villager. Judy Geeson and Jenny Agutter provide a little beauty amongst the ""beasts"", i.e., the Germans. The ""American style"" salutes seem out of place, by those playing Germans, e.g., Caine, as opposed to the ""heil"" salutes. [My tape was marred a little by some ""garbled"" sound at the end, I'll have to see if there is a DVD version.] I would say that it wasn't bad. There's also an interesting turn by Larry Hagman, of all people, as a ""gung ho"" American who's attempt to ""see action"" before he goes home to a ""desk job"" only gets him killed."
3,Decent,"Very unlikely story, but still enjoyable.By far not on the same league as Band Of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, which are real war stories, but still nice to watch.The reason why it gets three stars is because of how unlikely it would be for germans to parachute undisturbed and walk around England during WW2, without being identified because of their accent; even after telling them they were Polish soldiers, still very unlilely, as Polish people at the time were either volunteers in the German army or they fought against the germans as partisans, and were not enlisted with American uniforms.Not very believeable story at all.Lacks credibility."
4,Don't read the back cover!,"I can't answer for the quality of the DVD but whoever is responsible for the case should, in the spirit of the film, be taken out at dawn and shot. The blurb on the back cover takes you through pretty much everything that happens in the film, leaving out literally the last few minutes. No iron cross with oak leaves for that, though the film of course is very good."
3,Say what?,"The elements are all there--a film based on a famous novel, great cast, good direction, good production values, nice location shooting. Then, smack dab in the middle of an espionage/adventure story is what was probably an unintentionally-comic performance by Larry Hagman. This dvd has been bubbling to the top of many sale bins. It's worth watching and it does hold your attention, even though the story is a tad preposterous and there are too many genre twists and turns. At several points you will ask yourself, ""What is this movie trying to be?"" For those seeking Larry Hagman's most over-the-top, wiggy performance, this is a don't miss."
2,Disappointed Because Missing Scenes,I really LOVE this movie and had seen it on Netflix streaming. Missing from the DVD were the two scenes I most liked. The first was when Mrs. Gray explains why she became a saboteur and the 2nd was the beautiful organ piece the young German soldier plays when they have the final shootout with the Americans. I'm sending it back and would like to know if anyone knows of a copy which contains these two scenes. The movie is good anyway; but I really thought the missing scenes added much to the film. I checked run times and all say 134 minutes (except BluRay-does anyone know if it has the 2 scenes?) Sooooo disappointed.
4,I laughed out Loud,"I must admit when I read Marty Billsaerie review I laugh to myself about how many times he would watch it in a year, But hey I do remember this being quite an good WWII yarn and since it was only $12 down at Big W I figured a Blu ray movie couldn't be that bad well was I in for a shock, it was even better than I remember an it is quite a good transfer, sorry no 5.1 sound but this is an old movie, if you love or even like this movie for the price you will be very happy not sure what other people watched it on but it was a pretty crisp and clean transfer I have a 58"" Samsung Plasma and a Oppo Player and this movie looked very good to me so I hope you enjoy this also"
3,"Good Movie, Not So Good Copy","First of all I really like this movie, but if you buy this verison don't expect a good copy quality. The images are pretty dirty with occasional distracting blips. I suspect it was a direct analog to digital transfer with minimal, if any, clean up or restoration, but I've seen a lot worse.Nonetheless, I'd say it is watchable for the most part, especially if you are already a fan of the movie. I had actually considered purchasing the Blu-ray version but after reading the reviews it does not sound much better and is still pricey."
4,The Eagle Has Landed,"A fine adventure movie, stayed very close to the plot of the book by the same name by Jack Higgins, Recommended for all Higgins fans. Michael Caine was excellent as the German paratrooper. This is one of those stories where the heroes are the bad guys and everybody dies."
4,"Once you have read the book, see the movie....","Definitely a good movie. However, I think that if you go into it blind (without having read the book), it will be a little confusing for the first 20 minutes or so. However, once the characters and plot are introduced, the movie can stand on it's own.Michael Caine is very believable as a German officer. Donald Sutherland is a natural for an Irish Rogue.The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is bacause of the first 15 - 20 minutes."
4,A top-notch actioner!,"This terrific wartime thriller gets better with every viewing. A big plus for prospective UK buyers is the widescreen aspect, as the only DVD available over here is a crummy full-screen transfer."
5,Masterfully written and thoroughly engaging novel.,"Wow! This book turned out to be quite a surprise. I generally don't like ""child-themed"" science fiction so had left this one on my reading stack for a while. When I finally did get into the first few chapters, I found out how my preconceptions from the book's title, and the blurb on the back cover were totally off base.The very depth of mathematics and biology that are explored, within the context of a most fascinating story, are both mind expanding and enlightening. There is quite a bit more here than first meets the eye. The plotting and storyline combined with the hard science make this a most memorable and worth while novel. Highly Recommended."
5,Superb sequel to The Door into Ocean and Daughter of Elysium,"The Children Star is an example of thoughtful, hard SF at its very best. Full of wonderful scientific ideas, particularly in the areas of genetics and bacteriology; well-developed, engaging characters; interesting events; and a serious concern for such important issues as environmental and personal responsibility, it is one of my favorite SF novels of the last few years. Slonczewski writes science fiction for grown ups."
5,Fire Truck,"My kids love anything with fire trucks or firefighters, so when my 2-year old got this Pop & Go Fire Truck for his birthday, he wouldn't let go of it for anyone else to play with! The firefighters come out so there's lots of play value besides the fire truck itself. I signed on to buy the School Bus as a gift, and recommend these to anyone."
4,Nice Truck...But Be Carefull...,"My 18 month old loves trucks and cars and this was a great addition to his collection. The chunky pieces are a great size for his hands and there are enough pieces to keep him entertained. Just be careful as the ladder piece comes out of the truck and has a 5-6 inch, 1/2 inch diameter wooden dowel that can be hurtful if fallen on. Otherwise...it was a good buy for us."
2,Kind of dangerous!,"okay, i'm not the type of mom who adheres strictly to the ""must be over 3 yrs old"" rule for most toys, i figure if its not small enough for them to swallow or pointy enough for them to jab each other, they can handle it. but this is a little much, the edges of the truck are sharp (duh i could see that before i bought it but i thought it'd still be ok!) and the yellow thing comes off, and the people/dog are very sharp also! my two yr old was very excited for about 15 minutes, since she loves firetrucks and the one yr old didnt even look at it. now its sitting on a dresser literally gathering dust. (i just cleaned it off) also we only have one guy left, its impossible to keep things together isnt it? the guys dont really ""pop"" up, they just go up/down. kind of boring, dont ask me what made me think it would be fun! prob cuz i like the brand, but i'll stick to their puzzles."
4,Helped me with my fantasy idea,"If you're a fantasy fan like me, you probably have a novel or story idea you want to write. This book will help.The book is written by several fantasy authors, and they devote chapters to different aspects of fantasy: plot, characters, medieval medicine, medieval food, humor, marketing, etc.I found the chapter on Magic to be worth the price of the whole book, as it sent my idea in a whole new direction. Great book."
1,self-congratulatory and silly,"How do you get published in Fantasy Fiction? One way is to start your own company and write books about writing. I can only think that is what must have happened here. Most of the articles are empty and self-indulgent. Certainly, there's little new here. If you already have any books on writing, you probably don't need these. All three volumes lack substance, and some of the writing is downright silly. For example, the bio for Tina Morgan in the back of Volume II starts with the line ""At the age of four Tina Morgan's mother recorded her telling a story of an unfortunate princess."" So, if Tina was talking when her mother was four, just how old was Tina's mother when she had Tina? Two? Has anyone reported this miracle to science? Or was there a timewarp so that Tina could go back in time in order to teach her four-year-old mom to run a recorder? Where were the editors? I was seriously disappointed."
1,established writers? gimme a break!,"The editorial claims the contributing authors are ""new and established voices in Science Fiction and Fantasy."" Many of the contributors have never even been published for their fiction work. What expertise can they have to offer others when they can't get published themselves? Gimme a break!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Only gave it 1 star because I couldn't give it less."
4,"Good starting point, but there are better books","This book is hit and miss. It is a good starting point if you want a few of facts about weaponry or combat, but not much detail. However, there are a excellent sections on food and medicine. I guess this is to be expected from a book written by a multitude of authors.I recommend purchasing ""The Writer's Complete Fantasy Reference"" instead."
3,Good Refresher,"I enjoyed this book, but I also thought that this was review for the experienced actor. Though it does have some new ideas, anyone who has had experince in movement or advanced acting will understand and recognize these techniques. I think it's hard to write an acting text without sounding a bit superior. She kept referring to her schooling as ""drama school"". I think it's good for people to read as a refresher course"
4,Funny,"Was not sure how to rate this funny movie, but it made me laugh. Price was a little high, but anyway, this movie made me laugh. Thanks Amazon"
2,what the.....,"I tried to think of many ways to approach this film and describe it. It was just so bizarre that it left me wondering whether the makers of this film were being serious or wether the whole thing was just supposed to be comically bizarre yet entertaining. It seemed like some mexican soap opera makers decided to make a bad pseudo comedy movie version of Saving Private Ryan, HOWEVER, the film kept me strangely entertained. I won't rush out and tell people to flock to see this film but some people might love the comedic approach. Not the worst, but it won't make anybody's top list."
1,Awful movie.,"I really wanted to like this movie but it's just not a good movie. The story is great but the screenplay is too B-movie for my liking. The dialogue is full of telenovela cliches and the pacing is terrible. I was expecting a Mexican satire of action films, instead it feels like a bad rip off. The only thing that I can say was quality was the sets. They do a better job of portraying the character of the story better than the director. A lot of the actors seem talented but you'd never know it by this film."
1,30 years later ...,"Thirty years later, so much of what Hal Lindsey predicted hasn't come close to coming true.What's equally sad is that he has divorced his first three wives, and is on ""number four."" This from a man who studies and teaches the Bible?"
1,"The author claims to be a prophet, but he is a stooge","I'll be sincere.I tried to read this trash-book, on an internet site.This book writen by a protestant draws a 1980s decade and a future absurd and senseless.Please, don't waste your time reading this garbage.I read just 10 pages of this garbage and was too much."
5,I'm Glad All Over,"The CD was in perfect condition, brand new. I liked that it came quickly. The music was great, it brought back lots of great memories. I love it."
5,One of my favorite bands ever,"I first heard of them when I read that Escape the Fate's new singer Craig Mabbitt was originally in it. I'm a huge fan of his vocals and lyrics, along with Escape the Fate and the Word Alive so I was excited to hear more of his work. Of course, I was impressed with Mabbitt's work and Higinia is one of my personal favorites of the album. It's beautiful and has the perfect balance of screaming and singing, along with the rest of the album. And as the other reviews said, it puts out Christian messages without overpowering the music with it. Well done to the entire band. This, along with their new stuff with Beau, is some of my favorite of all time. Live long, blessthefall."
2,A bit stagnant in the diversity department,"The Good""A Message to the Unknown"" is an in-your-face assault of fury with shades of melody thrown it for good measure. ""Higinia"" focuses more on vocal harmony, but still tosses in plenty of blood-thirsty howls. The rapid-fire drum work is simply devastating. ""Rise Up"" displays some heavy riffs, as well as ear-piercing vocals. ""Pray"" is a dark horse track, due to its soothing acoustic rhythms and tuneful vocals. Don't be fooled into thinking the group is going soft, because half-way through, they bring the thunder. ""With Eyes Wide Shut"" sets a haunting tone.The Bad""Guys Like You Make Us Look Bad"" sounds just like the song that preceded it (""A Message to the Unknown""). As the album plays on, you'll swear that Bless The Fall's guitar player only knows one guitar lick.The VerdictA decent mix of hardcore and melody, but it's a bit stagnant in the diversity department."
5,Zeus+Apollo = Schnabel's Schubert!,"This EMI Rerferences set is amazing! The sound quality is excellent for the late 1930's, loud and clear!It is the best Schubert I've ever heard! And one could easily think that Schnabel is playing late Beethoven!"
4,Classic Schnabel,Schnabel at his best -no technical problems here! Articulates the substance of the music perfectly. B.H. Haggin was right about his playing.
1,What a waste of time!,"This book was very general. All the author did was write a general book about ""business"" and then inserted different titles to match the type of business you are putting together. Basically he could have written one book and titled it How to Start & Manage a Business. I wanted specifics about the trucking industry. I know the basics, that is not what I needed. It bothers me because I find it to be misleading. There were no exact references about the trucking industry. It was not worth the cost, maybe $5.00 would have been sufficient!"
2,Non receipt is the reason I don't like it,"I ordered this book on Nov 20. Today is Dec 23, and I have not yet received the book. Please remedy thesituation by sending the book or giving me a refund.I would prefer the book. Thank you.Anna Thomas"
2,any title that has the word inspiration in it. . .,"should set off warning lights in your head. This book is not terrible but my advise is to pass on it. You see, this book was terribly boring. I found it neither timeless or inspirational. I find it pathetic when a book has to feed the reader the review in it's title. This book revels in own mediocrity. She is nothing more than a pleasant mormon writer."
5,The Port Chicago Munity,I talked with the author many years ago and received an autograph copy of the original book when it was published before it became a movie
1,Traitors looking for redemption!,"Although this event itself was quite tragic, these men were traitors and they were by definition mutinous. Pardoning them befouls the good names of the men that died there and the other 200+ men who went back to work. This whole movement is simply an NAACP backed propaganda story to later recover some monitary value from the Navy and the government. It's ridiculous! Don't waste your money on this book."
3,EHHH?!?..,"The graphics are decentThe combat/shooting isn't as good as a GTA game, but it's much, much better than the 1st Mafia game.It's linear, so there isn't much to do, well, there isn't anything to do besides the missions.It's worth a buy if you get it cheap."
3,sopranos road to respect,if you are a sopranos fan you will like it. it takes to long to load plus it takes you back to places that you are only there for a couple seconds and then.you have to go somewhere else . the real vocies are cool. but there is no free roam. and there is no .comparing it to the god father .that is a far better mafia game
3,A road to short......,"The Sopranos game was very surprising with its graphics and storytelling. I thought that it would suck like most video game tie-ins to popular media. However, I liked being ""Little Pussy"" and exploring Sopranos New Jersey. It was just too short for my taste which include GTA and RPG titles. I am spoiled for the open environments that those games provide. The fighting system is way too easy and it is absurd that a game with such realism would have a mafia thug fighting like Batman or Daredevil. The graphics are impressive and their is even some nudity if you like that, but the replay value comes from the poker game. I unlocked all the money making options solely to have poker money. If you like the series this is a good episode to play. If you are a gamer, you will hate the potential wasted in this game."
3,It Is Alright,"This is an alright game, but in reality it is real easy to beat. So if you have the money or gift cards to waste, and want an easy game to beat then this is your game."
2,Sucks,"This games sucks. Don't waste your money on it, the game is only 5 hours long tops. If you want to play a great mob game play The Godfather."
1,No fun.,"I was hoping for a free-roaming world type of game where you can rank up to be a memeber of Tony's crew, but instead you are stuck within an extremely small an limited environment which feels constricting. It's lame. I feel bad the guys lent their voices to this crummy game. It's not that fun - yah you can fight guys and there's some kind of special moves but it was all so boring that I couldn't tell you how to even execute some of these moves - it's a little complicated and not worth your time learning cause you get no special reward for executing them. Money is a complete waste in the game. Don't bother collecting it for yourself as it serves no purpose whatsoever for the game itself. It's weak. I rented it and won it in maybe 4-5 hours gametime. It's not challenging in the least. I never died or lost a fight. I wasn't even trying - just playing to see if it got good. Don't waste your time. Go watch Season 1 again."
1,What a Disappointment!,"The graphics are amazing, the voice-overs are from the real characters, and the play, although not allowing free roam, tells a very fun story.....That being said, I have never been more disappointed with a game in my life!!!!!! I played the game sparingly over the course of about 2-3 days, and would say that it only took me 5-6 hours of gameplay before beating it and getting made. Further, I only died twice, and used my gun no more than 2 or 3 times (most of the time you can just punch and grapple strategically, and win). I think that had they taken more time and actually COMPLETED this game, it would have been one of my all-time favorites, but as it is, I am shocked that the best show ever made feels it appropriate to put their name on such an underachiever!"
1,Another 40 bucks down the drain...,"When I bought this game, like most other people, I expected a free-roam, mission-based, ""Godfather"" or ""GTA"" style game. Unfortunately, six hours after peeling back the cellophane, I was left feeling unsatisfied. It felt rushed, like the game designers just got bored with the project. But that's the problem with buying before renting."
1,"Jesus, Can't I Give It Negative Stars?","Man, I love the Sopranos more than anything. Been a huge fan ever since the beginning, but damit, what is with this pile of smoked trash? I rented this sucker since it's been blasted by reviews on Amazon, and I beat it in three and a half hours! Plus, this isn't anything like the Mob. If there was any game that was absolutely more insulting and lame than the attempt at the Godfather, it's the Sopranos. When are game developers going to wake up? You all need two shots to the back of the head."
1,Complete Letdown,"Thank goodness like other reviewers I only rented this game. I beat it in less than four hours. The gameplay was unimaginative, the graphics sluggish, and the environments - while accurately rendered - were completely sterile. You're basically told what to do through the whole game. On your way to complete pointless missions, you just beat a lot of people up. I finished this game feeling cheated. If I had actually paid $40 for it, I would have been furious because there's absolutely no replay value here. The design of this game was completely rushed, and the makers were counting on the participation of the real actors to convince people that this thing was worth buying. If you're interested in this game, just rent it. But be warned - you can never have that four hours of your life back. DO NOT BUY!"
2,dissapointing,i thought the game would be harder than it was. I thouht the game would be much longer and more interesting but really it was a big dissapointment. Dont waste your money
1,The Sopranos: Road to Respect,"Intially when I heard that this game was coming out, I was excited, big fan of the series, but after playing the game I was upset. The storyline is the best thing about the game. Most of the game play is crap the only good part is the enviroment interaction when killing somebody. The game is way too short. Overall, this game is not even worth renting."
2,Very disappointed,"Game starts off great. The sound and the graphics look great but it's a total flop. How can they even pawn this off for $40 when GTA, Scarface, and Godfather actually are semi-difficult to complete? All-in-all, this is 1/3 of what a complete game should be."
1,Buyer Beware!!! - Madon!!! this game SUCKS,"Like most people that will purchase this title , I'm a huge fan of the series and while I wasn't expecting to be blown away, this game is an utter dissapointment. THQ really phoned this one in, and are out to make a quick and dirty buck off the show's loyal fans.I'm not much of a gamer, and I finished this piece of crap in under 4 hours. No strategy is required at all.. You beat thugs up, then you beat more of them up, then you beat up a bunch of them and you get made. The end. I was seriously pissed when I realized I had finished the game.I wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not. To make matters worse, the graphics are some of the worst I've seen on the Ps2. Do NOT buy this game, you will be sorry."
1,Horrable,I think this game should be taken off the market because of the language and nudety. The makers of this game should be ashamed of themselves. I saw the series on HBO and this game is way more raunchier. i am just shocked that there are people who find this game fun and entertaining!
5,The Sopranos: Road to Respect,We enjoyed this game very much as we are Sopranos fans. The graphics are great and the story line is fantastic.
2,Little Game,"I am a huge fan of the television show, but this game really disappointed me. I really don't think that this game should have been released yet. I finished the game in less than 3 hours. I thought I was about to level up and the game was over. I died a total of 3 times, and I suck at video games. Way too short. This seemed like a demo rather than a full legnth game. I don't the fact that I spent 39 dollars, and got so little for my money. Do not buy this game. Rent it if you want, but do not buy."
1,Weak....,I'm sorry to say that this game is Weak. I was looking forward to some real Mafia gameplay. There is no free roam - you just follow the story line. I did more fighting than shooting. I finished it in 4 hours and only died 4 times. It kind of plays through like a movie you're a part of b/c there aren't any options. The graphics are cool and the fact they did their own characters is cool - but it's just not what I expected. Weak.....
4,entertaining and fun,This game was fun but missed a few things for me to keep from giving it 5 stars. It wouldn't let you play some mini games that looked like it should have been built in. Also some weapons were not available when you really needed it them.All in all was fun and graphics were good but the play time was short and didn't have any additional levels. Character voices and faces were true to their tv characters.
3,A Mixed Review,"The author's scientific credentials are impeccable, but his knowledge of Christianity is pretty dismal. For example, he writes that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute. I'm no Biblical scholar, but I know that, not only is there no Scriptural authority for that claim; there is no evidence whatsoever. If a ""creation scientist"" claimed that the dinosaurs were animals that Noah forgot to put on the Ark, he would be ridiculed as an illiterate Bible pounder. When a man of learning chooses to write about religion and science, he owes it to his audience to be as careful about his religious data as he is about his scientific data. The author accepts the Resurrection on faith, although he says that if it turned out that Jesus didn't rise from the dead, he (Stannard) would still be a Christian. The truth is, if Jesus didn't die and rise again, his whole mission is pointless.I was disappointed, but others might enjoy this book. It's not the worst book in the world; I may have set my hopes too high."
2,Shouldn't Quit His Day Job1.,"To flesh out what one previous reviewer hinted at, this book attempts what several philanthropic organizations are paying good money for: To meld religion (Faith/Un-reason) and Science (Reason / Unbelief). It is a mildly interesting read, yet Stannard ends up doing a dis-service to both particle/ Astro-physics, and Christian Apologetics. There is a sound thinking behind epistmilogically seperating physics and meta-physics: one is academic, one is artistic. The last culture to wed them with success was the Greek, and we are long past Athenian philosophical treatises on objectivity and subjectivity. Try reading Stephen Hawking, and Debates between Dan Barker and William Craig on The Secular Web. At least it was short, though."
1,book review,"I dont recommend you waste your money on this book. Rather than accept the biblical accounts of Jesus life as written, the author modifies them (adopting the theories of the most liberal scholars, and manufacturing some strange theories of his own) to fit his ideas of what is possible.He allegorizes everything from the virgin birth to the resurrection, discounting the disciples eye witness accounts as mere story telling."
4,A must for legal libraries,"Skadden is an excellent history of both the rise of the modern law firms as well as one of those firms which epitomized that movement. Lincoln Caplan uses an indepth analysis of the practice, politics and people of Skadden Arps to analyze how and why law firms, which had traditionally been small parterships have since grown into businesses as large and competitive as many of the corporations they represent. The story is very well written and insightful and it is obvious that Caplan did extensive research both inside the firm and in legal libraries. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in legal history and it is a good insider's guide to people who do not have experience in a law firm, but are considering working in one or are simply curious what goes in them."
2,Boring,"It is one of the eternal mysteries to me that D'Oyly Carte managed to gain a reputation for being stodgy and conservative; compared with Sargent's EMI recordings they are liveliness itself.The cast is at best fair in this very dull recording. None of them seem to have the faintest idea of what they are singing about, but at least they make some nice sounds. Sargent though is much, much too slow and drags everything down to an oratorio like solemnity.Its recordings like this that give G&S a bad name."
5,No Sweat,"This is my second review for this product. There were one small pouch of O-rings missing for the fuel injectors. Tiny mess us, contacted friendly, awesome customer service and had them in hand in a couple days. I recommend this company to everyone."
4,Inspiration from a Christian Leader,"In places, J. C. Penney is a powerful advocate of applying the teachings of Jesus Christ to his life. For example, he writes, ""I believe wholeheartedly that, without God in our hearts, we have nothing, and can achieve nothing of true value."" He talks about going from obscurity to prominence. Writing of such a personal nature perserves the intimate thoughts of individuals in a generation. Penney captures the mindset of a progressive era in American history, a time of growth and transition to urban living.One thing that bothered me was the way he lumped Christianity with other religions in some sections. The teachings of Jesus Christ are unique and have no parallels. Read them from the primary document, the Bible. Penney was wrong to try to superficially tie all religions into one lump."
5,"Lovely, sweet and catchy.","I heard this CD a couple of weeks ago at a release party at a bar in Cambridge. Usually the music in a noisy bar just blends into the din, but this music captured my attention.""28 Plastic Blue Versions of Ending Without You"" is the fourth release for Boston-based band Francine. It's a dreamy, sweet album, full of catchy intros, addictive choruses and weird sounds. The lyrics are lovely and the band is ridiculously talented. It has an Elliott Smith/Yo La Tengo feel to it. It can serve as that album you have on in the background while you're puttering around the house, or the one that keeps you rapt at attention in front of your stereo.Pay particular attention to ""Fake Fireplace Things"", ""This Sunday's Revival"", ""13 Years"" and ""NASCAR""."
5,Favorite livingroom toy,"I bought the bean bag toss as a Christmas gift for my 22 month old son. He had played the Bean Bag Toss the first time at the Halloween carnival at the church. It was all he wanted to play that night. I wanted something that would be easy to pick up at the end of the day. At just three pieces,it is simple to put together and take apart. Although it says it is for 5 and older, it would probably get old fast for a child that age."
1,bean bag toss,"I purchased bean bag toss for my four year old grandson, it was his birthday, it was absolutely no challenge - no fun and required absolutely no dexterity. very very disappointed, if it was possible to return it I would"
4,Great quality but too heavy,I love the style of this boot so much~~ Everything is perfect expect its weight. Next time I think I will buy a less heavier danner boot.
5,13 years later,"These were a gift for my husband. He had his last pair of Danner boots for 13 years, and wore them daily through harsh winters, hiking trips, all over Europe, had them resoled at least two times. Finally, this year, he was ready for a new pair. He insisted on getting exactly the same kind, and even waited several months after Christmas, for his size to come in. He is thrilled with his new pair, and hasn't even needed a breaking-in period. These are high quality, waterproof boots--built to last!"
1,Danner Boots Very Disappointing,"Having owned multiple Danner boot products over the last thirty years and having been 100% satisfied with previous purchases, I was very surprised at the poor quality of construction of these Mountain Light Hikers. The front eyelets on the right boot were not installed symetrically and the gussetted tongue on the left boot was installed incorrectly. Can't understand how this pair slipped past quality control inspection. I am returning them to Amazon."
2,Too Low,"I ordered these to compare with a pair of Alico Summit boots. A stitched on sole was the one thing I really wanted. These absolutely do not support your ankles whatsoever and I personally think it could actually contribute to turning your ankle. Also the leather seemd more like leatherette or vinyl to me. I asked my wife's opinion as well and she said, ""Are these leather?"" The only saving grace for these was that they are made in the USA. If you are looking for a well made quality boot with a sewn on sole you should seriously conider looking at Alico. Danner has goretex and Alico doesn't but there is more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to keeping water out. This is just my opinion and I would go with Danner since it is a sewn on sole only if there were no other options. Overall very disappointed because I was really really wanting to purchase a boot made in America with sewn on soles but I guess I'll just have to wait."
4,good good good,"2010'''''''''danner'''''''''''''''''''''''''''2E' ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''The size problem is commensurate to the nike sport footwear , brief greater part stack. Hope that the energy is resolved the actual problem because size problem is difficult to choose, the size that the amazon provides standard , not want to assume a reference with that size. If you like to have towel socks on ,my personal meaning is that big half yards alternative shoes , this way can make foot more spacious being well more."
5,great buy,"These boots are kicking ass so far. been wearing them everyday around campus, haven't taken them on a hike yet. Two weeks has gone by and they are finally starting to break in and become comfortable consistently. The leather is getting soft and is forming to my foot. The quality of these boots seems pretty superior to a merrell boot made overseas. I own a pair of 240 dollar Chippewa work boots, more time is needed to compare my new Danners to those. Def buy the brown boot dressing off of Danners website."
5,Classic & handsome Made in USA Boots,"These are just the best hiking boots out there in my opinion. Extremely well made in the USA, short break-in period and last for years. Sure, they're a bit more expensive than the Chinese sweatshop boots, but they are bombproof & supremely comfortable. I think they have made this style for many years as they are a classic that never goes out of style!"
2,Smokey Quartz ring,"Pretty Smokey Quartz Gemstone Band .925 Sterling Silver RingThe setting prongs are high and catch on loose material. The sterling silver looks like it is sterling silver coated. Very high gloss, shallow depth. I know this is an inexpensive ring, but in person it looks even cheaper than that."
2,Too big and horsey looking,"I purchased this ring along with the same vendor's 'adorable garnet' ring. Both had to go back. The garnet ring was nice but the large stone was damaged in multiple spots. This ring was in excellent condition but it was just ridiculously big. The photo looks like a ring that could make a statement but not one that would be an anchor! It wasn't heavy, just cheap looking. You half expect to see mold lines up the sides of it. The prongs were also huge and unshapely. It's a shame because it could have been really lovely had the maker simply reduced the size and taken a little more time with the details.I am hesitant to buy from this vendor again."
4,Purchased for a 2005 Scion xB.,"Material is of an apparently decent quality, stitching is good, instructions are easy, and it shipped pretty fast for a custom item. There is a little extra material and it does not fit quite like I would want but it does fit very well and it looks great and feels great. Definitely worth the up charge over universal leatherette seat covers (usually $50-$60/ seat in an auto store).A note though, these smell very strongly of vinyl when they come out of the box. It goes away in a day or two but it would be worth letting them sit out unpacked for a day or two so you do not have to drive in the strong vinyl fumes for that same period.All in all, I am happy with them and am going to order the rear seat set as well."
1,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"I thought this product was made for someone with big arms..I have 20 inch biceps. I can barely fit it around my forearm---much less bicep...Total waste of money...Also, my MP3 Bible will not even fit this piece of junk..."
1,Deceiving Product Image,I would rather see the product itself rather than the body it is attached to. As if you'll ever have that kind of body anyway. That's why I'm searching elsewhere.
4,A few errors,Interesting - The book is copyright 2004 by the Metropolitan Transit Authority. The legal name for the parent agency is Metropolitan TRANSPORTATION Authority. So is this book legal?
2,Sturdy but defective,I wanted a metal hook for a few doors. I ordered 3 in white. Two of the three had paint bubbles on the front of the hook that make it look cheap (which they aren't).
4,"Beware of iTunes ""Gianni Schicchi""","For anyone thinking about downloading the Tito Gobbi ""Gianni Schicchi,"" beware of the version being sold by iTunes. The iTunes version is actually a monaural file. Perhaps this is because for many years the EMI/Gobbi recording was in commercial LP release as monaural, like the rest of that EMI ""Il Trittico"" set, though in fact the ""Gianni Schicchi"" (unlike the other two operas in the set) was originally recorded by EMI in true stereo. For some reason (maybe they got mixed up?), iTunes is selling the horrible old mono edition instead of the wonderfully remastered stereo edition. Believe me, I know -- I bought that crappy iTunes mono download. Let the buyer beware!"
3,be careful,"I purchased two of these toys and only one of them works - the other mouse is silent. I'm not sure yet if the cats will play with it anyway, but I'm letting you know that this is another cheap rip-off item from China - I should have known better"
3,Not the best but worth a one time listen,"This American Life is my favorite show of all time. I listen to it religiously. I didn't like this one. It's kind of depressing, whereas I have listened to the other CD's over and over again."
4,Another good collection,"This is the third ""best of"" collection from ""This American Life"", and it's the collection that I find I listen to the least. The quality of storytelling is still there, but there's something that's slightly off about these. While there are great moments of humor and thoughtfulness. I particularly love the story of Julie Snyder attempting to get her phone bill corrected.Perhaps it's just a reflection of the mood the country was in during the time these stories were produced and first broadcast. If you are a fan of TAL, this will be an enjoyable listen. Will you return to it? You might go back a couple times, but I find that this collection doesn't require repeated listens unlike the first two collections.Still, this is a good collection of ""This American Life"" stories, and even some of their weaker material is better than a lot of other radio broadcasts."
3,Hit and Miss,"I bought this for my husband, because I thought the subject matter would really suit him. He listened to it and said that a lot of the stories did not really seem to fit the topic or were just not that interesting. This is disappointing, because to me, This American Life has sooooo many driveway moment stories that I figured this was a sure bet. I look forward to TAL putting out more CDs, though."
2,Missed the mark.,"I am a big fan of This American Life and look forward to listening to it every week. With so many stories to choose from I'm afraid they simply missed the mark with this collection. The title was misleading, ""Hope"" was absent. Some stories were actually disturbing. I'd skip this one. Instead I highly recommend: Lies, Sissies, and Fiascoes: The Best of This American Life."
2,avoid,"OK this is really bad. Here again Twice a Man do what they probably think they do the best, some crappy concept album that is filled with ambient soundscape music like the type that Coil did when they were at their most boring. really I lovvve electrtonic music in general and ambient sutt especially but not this kind."
3,Pretty Good Anime...,"Pretty good anime overall. The movie didn't go in-depth with the characters too much, but the plot was good."
2,Not worth the time and money to collect.,"This is one of the worst anime I've seen so far.Although I like the anime drawing style... very similar to that of Blue Seed, characters and storyline are rather on the weak side. I really got the impression this OVA is somewhat a rush job and a bit amateurish. Voice actings are somewhat tolerable.The captions are somewhat less than desirable. Sometimes sentences appears before it is being spoken. The name of character in front of spoken lines are really not necessary if they had done the caption right.Frankly I would rather watch Pokemon again and again than this."
3,"Decent movie, decent animation, GOOD price","A complete set for a cheap price is the largest bait this has to offer. The animation is decent, but not top notch. The story could also use a lot of work. If your a teen looking for a laugh or just a silly few hours, I suggest this to any of you (even girls). This is totally NOT a fanboy/serv. video, just good clean silliness."
3,Compact but shoddy craftsmanship,This bible is really handy and compact. The cover is designed to look like it has a flap that closes around the edge but that is just the stitching. The printing is crisp and sharp and so far I have not seen any smudging. The one thing that was bad was the overglue of the front cover's vinyl edge making the first blank leaf stick by about an inch. Forcing it off ruins the paper and leaves some on the vinyl edging. Other than that it does the job of providing a basic KJV bible with a very spartan concordance.
2,I can't believe this doesn't come with what you need!,"The printer is fine, but Lexmark is horrible with not including the parts necessary to make the printer functional. You have to buy an additional $20.00 part just to get the printer to work in the form of an overpriced USB cable. - This cable is impossible to find as well. Our local Staples didn't have it and I had to research the web for a while to figure out where to get it!"
3,NOT MAC COMPATIBLE,"Plainly put: This camera will not work with a Mac unless you jump through loops, buying extra software and wasting a lot of time -- besides the conversion process to make your movies editable in iMovie is excruciatingly slow.This should be explicit in the amazon advertisement. It is now."
2,"Nice idea, Poor Low Light Performance","Despite what the other reviewer say the low light performance of this camera is very poor. All the colors are washed out, and inaccurate! Red show up as some kind of orange, when shooting indoor.The 1MP camera is worthless, indoors or outdoors.The only thing that this camera has going for it is its 60MB Hard Disc recording medium, and even that Sony puts a NICE disclaimer on. Backup your content often; we are not responsible for data loss. Make one wonder if it's worth the risk.I do not know about you, for $$$ I expect a camera to record my memories as I remember them. My $$ digital camera take better move clips than this camcorder, under same lighting condition."
3,Every thing is good except low light performance,"I agree with the previous reviewer. The low light performance of this camera is pretty bad. Deeps reds are more like deep pinks...but other colors are quite natural, though a bit flat.It is a nice camera otherwise: very compact, HDD makes a world of differenc in ease of use. Handgrip takes some getty used to.Stills are useless. No built-in flash makes situation even worse.Would have liked to have component video out so that we can get widescreen output diretly from the camcorder to TV.I may end up trading this for the big-brother DCR-SR100...."
3,Great buy,The only pseudo complaint is that the quality of the picture is grainy. The size and convenience make up for any deficiency in the quality of picture.
4,it was great but a little confusing at the end,the end really confused me i thought liz would end up with sean and maggie would end up with dennis
4,First book I ever read and I'm 41 now!,"I was mentioning to my husband that ""My darling my hamburger"" was the 1st book I had ever read, I think I was 15. My daughter now is 16 and I was telling her that she needs to read it because it really was an awesome book. So, today I'm ordering it for her. It leaves quite an impression in ones mind! Order & Enjoy@!My Darling My Hamburger"
2,Points.....,"This book has loads of detail and is not that short. It's not a sort of book for a reluctant reader, or someone under the age of 12. It wasn't really my type anyway.I wouldn't lend it to someone in need of a good book."
2,Disoriented,"This book was a delight at first to read, then it started to use issues that I think were very disgusting and since I am in 8th grade I refused to write my book report on this subject and discuss it in front of my piers. But if you're looking for a book about abortion and sex, this is the book for you."
1,Horrible,"If there is any tool of education which highlights our depraved society, it is this book. I am sure Paul Zindel means well, but his outlook on human life is simplistic at best and cynical at worst. The man clearly believes humanity is a small step above animals, and that our children should be raised to accept their fate in this Ricki Lake world in which we live.This is the sort of book that turns children into sex and relationship obsessed creatures, consumed with nothing but the desire to eat and procreate. It is for those who desire nothing more than to live like cattle, with some improved diversion courtesy other human inventors (ie television).What is even worse is reading the reviews of this book... Wow."
4,Great Book!,This is an execellent book about teenagers and all the usual problems teens go through. One of those problems is dating and sex. A girl and her boyfriend decide to take that step but they don't think of the consequences. Read the book to find out what happens!! I liked the book because it was about teenagers so I felt I could relate to the story. I give this book 4 stars.
3,Not my fave Paul Zindel book,"I expected better from him. I enjoyed the warm silliness of his other books,like The Pigman. This one was dramatic and true-to-life. However,it bungled in many places. Some characters were hypocritical and detestable. Maggie and Dennis weren't all that romantic and close,but they were the strongest characters. They provided relief from Liz's ridiculousness. I will give kudos for a poignant,thought-provoking ending. I use such strong language because I knew Mr. Zindel could've done better. It was overall an OK book,but don't read it if you're anticipating more great literature from him. Try The Pigman and its sequel or The Undertaker's Gone Bananas instead."
4,Teen troubles,"This book is based mainly for teens having troubles. It shows friendship, love, and dealing with your problems"
3,1 week and already falling apart.,"I really like the colors in this belly button ring, but the top jewel fell out within a few days of putting it in. I also had to get pliers to unscrew the two pieces. I really like it, but unfortunately, it fell apart."
3,"Terrific performances, distorted sound quality","I recommend this CD, but be aware that loud passages are distorted.Alicia de Larrocha performs some well-known, and some lesser known works sensitively, but it is a great pity that loud passages are distorted throughout this recording.The very first track, Asturias, is one of Albeniz' best known works. There is quite a bit of hiss here. When you realise that it was recorded in 1959 [the year I began piano lessons], you understand why there is a bit of noise.But the distortion is intrusive and will spoil your enjoyment of the terrific performances.I love Cordoba, and the performance on this CD is sensitive and inspiring.I also have De Larrocha's Favourite Spanish Encores CD, recorded in 1975, which contains no distortion, and is highly and unreservedly recommended. But, if you want a recording of Albeniz, I also recommend this one, but with the qualifications I have given."
4,Nick Carter in trouble in Greece,"Interesting Nick Carter tale, plenty of drama and slinky babes ready to shed their garments, some 'they need to be killed' baddies, good plotline and good supporting characters make this Carter AXE story entertaining. Four Lugers for this Grecian formula."
4,Very nice.,I purchased this along with another Steve Canyon dvd set for my Dad. He enjoyed this program growing up and I am glad to help him relive those times. It is a good show.
3,steve canyon cigarette ads,I enjoyed the quality of the Steve Canyon video vol 2 but was kinda taken back because they contained the original ads for cigarettes. A product like this should never be featured in anything. Did enjoy the old videos since this a program that I never had seen during its original run on tv. I will buy the vol 3 if they ever get it released. Always can depend on Amazon.com to get the orders delivered quickly.
3,unconvincing,"The book pushes what the author calls the Oxford Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, i.e. the many-worlds interpretation, as the ""correct"" interpretation of quantum mechanics. However, the argument in favor for it is only supported by a cavalier and arbitrary application of Occam's Razor, and dismissive (and sometimes ridiculing) statements against all alternative interpretations. I couldn't really find any strong argument supporting the Oxford Interpretation at all. I enjoyed the author's other books very much but this one was a bit of a disappointment. The author must be spending too much time in Oxford and allowed himself to be brain-washed by the many-worlders."
1,"Not a Barbie doll, if that's what you're looking for..","That's not Barbie - see Mattel - The Munsters Barbie & Ken Giftset. Same dress, but totally different doll. Of course, it's much more expensive.."
2,Not very pretty!,This doll is ugly. Lilly munster was beautiful and this doll has manly features. I was disappointed but love the munsters so I kept it. But I do agree with another review about how the packaging is better than the doll. Disappointed with doll but not enough to return it.
3,Does this person write erotica?,"Aside from the fact that this book is four years old and completely outdated as a market resource, the author's work hasn't appeared anywhere for at least as many years. Look to other ""experts"" before you invest in this no-longer-viable resource."
5,Above average serial killer flick,"This is quite a keeper. Erik Stern's performance as Caleb/Lester is mesmerizing. The story is about a split personality gardener whose alter personality is that of a sexist pig named Lester.Lester's primary targets all seem to be loose women who are more than willing to break their wedding vows with a quick roll in the Hay. The acting in this is passable considering this was during the 70's. As stated Stern's performance is the best here especially his vocal confrontations with his evil self (including a memorable mirror scene where we see the guy totally lose it).The cops in this move have depth but unfortunately like other serial killer movies are made to look dumb. Still Donald M. Jones who did the popular ""Schoolgirls in Chains"" knows how to deliver quite an entertaining movie."
3,Poorly mastered but still great,"The Love Butcher is a truly remarkable film. It has the ugliest sets I have ever seen - and as a bonus, they are all real places. This movie is a fabulous showcase of everything that was wrong with interior design in the early 1970s. Unfortunately it has never had an official DVD release, so the only way to see it is on poorly mastered discs like this one. The copy of the movie that I got was dubbed from the VHS, and as a result the awfulness of the sets (especially the wallpaper) is somewhat diffused. Other than the poor image quality this was a good deal - and frankly, you probably aren't going to find this available any other way. So if you are a fan of bad cinema, you should definitely buy this film, it is fantastic! Hopefully it will one day get the DVD release it deserves!"
3,Needs special screws to work with 1402-VLZ3,"The Mackie 1402-VLZ3 mixer is a workhorse that sounds great, but it is not easily rack mountable with this rack ear kit. The rack ear instructions say to simply remove the mixer screws and put them back in. However, over the rack ears the screws in the mixer are too short to even reach the threads. So I called Mackie parts, but they don't sell the screws. And initially, they didn't know what the threads are either...it's not in their parts list. Later, they were able to find out what screws are needed and sent some to me. They are a metric zinc pan head Phillips machine screw, M3.5-0.6 x 8. I found them online for five cents each, plus shipping. You'll need four of them. Here is the link to these screws at Fastenal.com: [...]"
2,"Heavy construction, no screws!","These rack ears by Raxxess are extremely heavy duty. That's not all good news if you have to carry your rack around, because you'll be cursing the extra weight. If you buy these for a Mackie 1402VLZ3, as I did, you better plan to spend some extra time and money finding and purchasing at least four screws and/or hardware to replace the chassis screws on the VLZ3 for mounting these brackets, as the existing screws won't even reach the threads through the thick metal of these rack ears. To me, the failure of Raxxess to provide necessary hardware to make the ears work out of the box is horrible customer service and support for the product. It appears when I'm done, the system will work in a standard 19"" rack (unlike the other reviewer's comment), but I'm off to find the hardware, cuz' I can't install the VLZ3 in my rack until I do."
1,Mackie mixer rack mounts,"Good quality construction, but don't exactly fit the mackie vlz pro 1402 as advertised. The hole configuration left only one possible way to attach and mount the mixer. To do so, I had to obtain washers and longer screws than the ones on the side of the mixer, and when attached, made the entire setup (nmixer plus rack ears) 21 inches wide, 2 inches wider than a standard audio rack. Needless to say, aftefr drilling 8 holes I am using them in a manner which works, but is not exactly the most efficient and aesthetic use of this product"
2,Not Really Their Best,"I'm sorry, but after searching for years for a greatest hits collection by the Happenings, I was so disappointed when I finally received this one! I know these guys recorded more than the hits on this cd, some songs here are downright painful and embarrassing to hear. Did they really need to do a version of the old Teresa Brewer schmaltzy tune ""Music Music Music""?! And ""My Mammy""?! GIVE ME A BREAK! I wish there was a collection out there with one of my favorite songs by these guys, the B side of ""Breaking Up Is Hard To Do""-a song called ""Anyway"". Does anyone out there know of another, better collection? If so, feel free to email me about it! ...Kim in NJ"
4,Powerfull harmony but album half empty,"One of my favorite 60's groups has long last come available on CD. NO-ONE has done ""Why Do Fools Fall in Love"" as well as The Happenings. The hits are all there, but there are better songs on the I've got Rhythmn album than the ""non-hits"" posted here. How about releasing some of the old albums boys ?"
1,Didn't Sound That Bad To Me,"Just received a copy of this CD. Don't think the re-mastering is all that bad. As I recall the originals that were played on the radio weren't all that great either. This CD probably does not contain all of the filler that was on the vinyl album, however; all of the top hits are here. Glad I own one."
5,I want to buy it!,I want to buy the Greenfield's Neuropathology. Please let me know when it is avairable.
2,It is tiny book for a teen!,"It is a 2"" x 1"" book with minimum concept of the Rich-Dad-Poor-Dad theory. It is helpful still. Maybe it is good for the teens who can't read through a normal big book."
2,Just Buy Rich Dad Poor Dad,I'm 16 and I've read many books about finance and investing including Rich Dad Poor Dad but this book is just to simple it's just a cut down version from the original book if you want to read a Kiyosaki book just get Rich Dad Poor Dad
1,It is the size of a cigarette box!,It is a tiny miniature book. Not worth it at all. Deceptive advertising in my opinion.
3,Could Be Better,I am a teenager who had previously heard of his book for adults under the same name. I bought the teen one because it looked like it would be simpler and I felt I would learn better with the exercises. But I feel it was too simplistic and I wonder if I would have been better off getting the book for adults.It is still useful but maybe what I was looking for was more information. This stuff felt too general talking about assets versus liabilities or good debt versus bad debt. Since I am still interested in the subject matter I will not give up.I might try one of his adult books before I give up completely.
1,A Rip Off,"Robert Kiyosaki has been milking this ""franchise"" dry. The idea was interesting and novel at first, but lately it's been ghost-written junk.The ""Teens"" book is a total waste: I thought I'd give it a chance because it was affordable and I thought the gearing towards teens might make it useful for my kids; it arrived today and I was shocked -- the book is literally about 3 inches wide by 3 inches tall (less than the size of two Tic Tac boxes put together). In total, there must be about 10 ""real"" pages within its miniature 124 pages. What a rip off.I'm getting sick of seeing this guy in newspaper ads, magazines (he used to ""write"" a monthly for Entrepreneur Magazine, but his columns soon deteriorated to a few inches of writing, next to a giant picture of himself, so they cut him out.Robert Kiyosaki has become lazy and derivative. He needs to give it a break and come back with something new in a couple of years."
5,Just as advertized!,The book arrived in excellent shape and in a timly manner. I was able to give it to a teen that I trust benefited greatly. Many thanks.
2,Size of a deck of cards,"I was surprised by the size of the book...it looks like a large book in the photo, but is actually about the size of a deck of playing cards.I was unpleasantly surprised to have been ""played"" by Amazon, as I would have made another purchase if I had known it was not a normal sized book."
1,Ridiculous,I saw nothing that stated this book I purchased was the size of a match book!!! I would not think that they even published books in such a manner. What a joke!! I guess you learn something new every day. Erik in NJ
5,GREAT READING!!,I bought this book for my son and he surprised me by reading through it soo fast! He loved it and I can tell he retained a lot of what he learned. He constantly talks about it in our everyday life. His philosophy has changed regarding so many things. I cant tell you how much this has done for him! Robert K... thank you for writing this!!
3,Could Be Better,"I'm fourteen and I've read four of Kiyosaki's books. I liked all of them, except for this one. He doesn't get into the facts about investing. Pretty much, all he says is get a job, control your spending, and invest. Save yourself $15 and buy Rich Dad Poor Dad instead."
4,This book is ABRIDGED!,"With all of the 1 star reviews saying this book is a tiny piece of fluff, I thought I would point out a couple facts. There are two versions of this book. One is a miniature version and is ABRIDGED. The other is a full size book with all of the benefits of an UNABRIDGED book. The bad reviews obviously didn't realize they bought the former, and not the full version.This book is great, but spend your money on the full variety. Teens will find this book worth it's weight in gold."
1,TINY PIECE OF FLUFF,"I found the original Rich Dad Poor Dad book interesting, but,...THIS ""book"" is 3 inches by 3 inches by 1/4 inch.It is a little piece of fluff, not a serious book.And it uses large print!I kid you not.It has 5 or ten pages of material in it.I returned it.Sheesh."
4,Nothing too heavy,"Clearly a very introductory work for a teen. Maybe a 12 year old or something. I'm 17 and I've been reading a lot about the stock market, studying individuals like Warren Buffett. If you have No Idea about money, read this one. It has some interesting things to say, like all books do."
1,Too small for the price and eyes,"It is too tiny, it is hard to read and it does not say much. I will return this book."
4,Brief and to the point.,This miniature edition is very brief and to the point. But the complete edition is much better. You do not have to wait for somebody to help you financially. Educate yourself and learn by doin it.
1,"A Toy Book, Not a Real Book","Although in the illustration it looks like a full-sized Rich Dad advice book, it is actually a miniature. I have no idea why Robert Kiyosaki chose to produce a product like this instead of publishing a real book for teens."
3,encouraging,This book is encouraging yet it does little to advice people on what to actually do. Most people do not have the advantage the writer had of havin good contacts.I left reading this book feeling worse than when I started becasue I had no one to help me do anything or explain things to me. it may be encouraging but does little to guide anyone.Dont waste your money
3,A little watered down......,"I felt this could have been a little more in depth for teens. This book maybe even seemed to have a patronizing tone to it, mild turn-off.Good solid concepts though.TV"
3,A Disappointment.,"My chief problem with this book is how the author seems obsessed with protecting the child's self-esteem from failure and ""peer review."" Self-esteem is her destination, not literacy. Roller, if youre reading this, the kid already knows he's a loser-frog, and his peers merely confirm his beliefs. As if the need for a tutor doesnt get the idea across with a bull-horn and searchlights. Competence takes care of self-esteem. Teach a kid how to spell the 50 most common words, and his problem is half-whupped. Increase his vocabulary to the 3000 most common words, and he's good to go 98 to 99 percent of the time....for life. It's that simple."
5,A good rousing rendition,"When I found that my favorite version of The Planets was not available on CD, I turned to this version. Boult supposedly conducted the world premier of The Planets and he seems to know what he's doing. A good all-around tradional interpretation, which is what you want with a work like this. Driving and powerful when it needs to be, subtle and delicate elsewhere (such as the Venus movement.) The Enigma Variations are a nice extra that I didn't have before. A worthwhile package."
1,poor oppressed women in the US,"this is NOT a novel about poor oppressed women in Saudi Arabia, but the very antithesis.Funny how we get these ideas."
1,Not again...,"The author shows little understanding of Saudi women and culture, relying on Orientalist stereotypes for his story. This book is based solely on the author's imagination - after all, as a man it would have been impossible for him to gain access to women's social circles. We don't need yet another fantasy about the plight of 'poor, oppressed, invisible' Saudi women."
5,"Worlds/words of shadow, worlds/words of light","A fresh voice full of hypnotic charm: you are almost instantly pulled into this strange-yet-somehow-familiar world that shimmers both on the page and in your mind. The book's motion, its play of words and strange deeds, bears digging into, focused exploration. The rewards are well worth the price of admission."
4,A Final Testament for Two...,"For those looking for the ""Last Word"" in solo piano repertoire: LvB's final half-dozen sonatas on his favorite instrument, recorded by British pianist Solomon (nee Cutner) between 1951-1956, just before his own career-ending stroke. To those who think Sviatoslav Richter's ""TEMPEST"" and Rudolf Serkin's ""MOONLIGHT"" and ""PATHETIQUE"" are definitive: so too are these. With only minor sound issues (a small edit blip towards the end of Sonata No.31 and Mono sound in general) these performances transfix more than all the others (Brendel, Kempff, Pollini, Hess) I have experienced. Listen to No.32 and... The End."
4,Recommended read!!,"I didn't really expect to like this book as much as my other paranormal books. It's a quick read, but it pulls you in the entire time. Christine Warren puts a new twist on the paranormal genre. The characters are likeable and plot is even better. If you are a newcomer to the paranormal romance genre I highly recommend this book as well as Patricia Briggs, Laurell K. Hamilton, and J.R. Ward, to name a few. I can't wait to read the next book ""She's no fairie princess""."
2,meh,I got bored right away. I guess I was expecting something different. I bought this series as a recommendation of a friend but I just cant get into it. I actually didnt even finish the book which for me is unheard of even if it sucks. I may go back and try again just because they are there but that is doubtful. The whole lot will probably end up at the book exchange.
3,"Like It, Don't Like It, Like It...","As a whole, I like this book. The characters could have used some more development to bring about more depth. They were what I would call sufficient, but they would have been stunning had they been better developed. The plot was predictable. The theme of supernatural beings on the verge of being discovered by humans is quite popular in this genre at the moment. If you're looking for a book with some intense ""romantic moments"" between total strangers who are in touch with their inner beasts this may be the book for you. There is a rush and lack of details about this book that make it seem more like an expanded short story than an actual novel. I pre-ordered the next novel in the series."
4,One of the sexiest Heros I've read in quite a while!,"I really enjoyed Christine's book. It ranks quite high in the slew of paranormals out there. The one thing I thought that made it stand out for me was the hero, Sullivan Quinn. I'm not usually a sucker for a paranormal hero, but prefer to read about kick-ass heroines, but Quinn did it for me. Sexy and Irish, need I say more. He was just alpha enough to stir my loins and sensitive man to stir my heart. Great characterization Ms. Warren! Bravo!"
4,Good Entertainment,I really enjoyed this book - more than I thought I would given many of the reviews I read. The romance was good with a few steamy scenes to spice up the intrigue. The plot involved some mystery adding to the book's entertainment value. Christine Warren casts wit to her story which makes the tale even more enjoyable. I recommend this romantic read without hesitation.Happy Reading from Bona Fide Reflections!
3,Just an ok story.,This was ok but not great. The characters seemed to be generic. Not a lot of friction just seemed to be an ok storyline. Predictable.
1,"Horrible... Well, maybe I'm a little heavy on it...","... But I didn't like it.Maybe it wasn't the time for me to read this book, but... bufff... I dind't like it.I don't like explaying about things that I don't like because I know how much effort the writter put in this book, as any other writter, so I only say that I dind0t like the way it was written, the characters looked as typical, and in some way I think the plot did, too, but I can say so for certain as I wasn't paying enough attention and was flipping pages so I could end it.Anyway, I have the other 2 books that follow this one, and I think those too look better to me.We'll see."
2,.,"Warren writes well in the light-hearted scenes but when it comes to anything plot driven it's tedius. She does make use of great myths that most paranormal writers over-look and so I'd be interested in books where those entities are the lead characters. Without that edge, this isn't anything special."
3,Fun but predictable,"I enjoyed this book, but it is not one that will end up on the keeper shelf. The series has a lot of promise and I will check out her next book, if just to watch her grow as an author. Here is what I liked...the lead protagonist were witty, lighthearted and fun. I wish that there was more plot development and tension built between the protagonists. Yes I get that it is hard to resist the built in ease of 'mating heat' so to speak, but really the story is so much better when the tension builds over the length of the novel. Other than that, the love scenes were hot, the banter witty. It is worth a read just for kicks and I think this author has potential."
2,Very Very Ehh...,"As another reviewer said, there is definately nothing new here. What's worse is that Warren may actually turn some people off to the genre with the disappearing/reappearing accents, the errors (at one point in the beginning of the book the heroine's parents are describe as both being shifters, later she goes on and on about her human father), the lackluster characters and the skimpy world building. I've read a couple of Warren's e-books and they weren't much better but at least they were cheaper!"
2,"A great, story if you skip the sex","I liked the cover, had a gift certificate and bought this book. I started it Saturday night, finished it Sunday; for this type of book that's a SLOW read for me. I realized about 1/2 way through that if I skipped any of the obviously broadcast extremely long and detailed sex scenes I missed NONE of the story. When the romance could've been wrapped up in less than 3 pages but the author devotes over 1/2 the book to it, kinda slows a book down.The story, characters and world-building were excellent, but the book could've done with less sex and more plot and actual interaction between the characters. Felt like she was just creating a rather intersting world so the reader would be trapped into reading about 100 pages of sex."
3,Expensive for an ebook,"I bought the ebook, which was $7.99. Kind of expensive, most of the time the ebook is a little cheaper than the paperback. I've read most of this series now and while I've enjoyed the stories they are a little inconsistent from book to book and in most of the books the subplots are left unresolved. That said, I love the creativity behind the story and they are a quick read."
2,original but not much mystery,"I enjoyed the half of the book I read which features wit and zany sex, and will probably read another of this author's mysteries. Still, one shouldn't know the solution to a 371 page mystery by page 195. The author might consider eliminating the innumerable redundancies--how he does go on."
2,Ben Elton's worst book,"I have read all of Ben Elton's previous books, have enjoyed his stand-up comedy, his play Pop Corn and his musical We will Rock You. All that stuff was great and tremendously funny! When I read this, his latest work I was really disappointed. It was truly his worst, and would recommend to anyone who has not read any of his works: Do not start with this one!Although it was witty, it was generally too far-fetched and simply very predictable. I knew how the murder mystery would evolve one third into the book.. Please Ben, stick to funny, stick to temporal fiction and your hilarious vocabulary, but stay away from murder mystery, as the genre clearly does not become you."
2,I liked it but I didn't love it. A little disappointing.,"The book starts off well with highly descriptive (though a little gruesome) scenes of murder, it has some great comedy moments and a lead character that pretty much everyone can relate to... there is a 'BUT' though - I just don't think the mix works well, the genre is confused and a little inconsistent, there are a couple of golden scenes which are fantastic to read though there aren't enough of them to make it a great book. I liked it but I didn't love it!"
3,Predictable but entertaining,"I've read several Ben Elton books, and found this one to be a bit lackluster compared to his other works. The killer's identity is blindingly obvious from about the middle of the book, which makes it even more annoying when Elton continues to trot out characters and make some reference to them being shady, which is clearly supposed to make us think ""Oh, SURELY this guy must be the killer!"" Despite this, it is a quick and entertaining read."
4,Os Mutantes reunion concert album - the full version,"This is an expanded (or rather, complete) version of the Os Mutantes reunion gig, held in 2006 in London's Barbican Theatre. Released in the US and UK as a 2-CD set, this features original Mutantes members Sergio Dias and Arnaldo Baptista, joined by 1990s pop singer Zelia Duncan (as a replacement for Rita Lee, who didn't want to participate in the show). It's a surprisingly strong performance for these old-timers with good sound quality and a lot of emotion put into the show. This 3-CD set might be for hardcore fans only, but it's still pretty cool. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Brazilian Music)"
5,Colorful fun!,"I absolutely love Chelsea's winter outfit because it's so fun and colorful! I love the puffy blue jacket because it looks like a coat a real person would wear. The matching scarf and hat are just adorable. The white muffs on the bottom of her pants are removable and I love how they look. Chelsea has a cute, elbow-length shirt under the jacket. She also comes with skis, ski boots, ski poles, and a helmet. I gave this doll 4 stars for educational value because of the helmet, which someone should wear if they go skiing. I'm impressed that Mattel would include it with the doll, it sends a great message about safety. Yet another beautiful, eye-catching doll from My Scene!"
2,A CHEWED BAR?,"I was excited when i first opened the package. However, one of the bar was opened, and it was torn and eaten by something or someone. The expiration date was in 2 months."
1,South Park.,"You have to be slightly eccentric to watch this film, it is no where near as good as the programs on channel 4.it may appear funny when youve watched it once after that it is annoying. the songs are absolute trash.it is amazingly immature racist and homophobic.this film is discusting.i do not recommend this to anyone anywhere. the language is unneccisary. if i was you i would look up another film with taste, like kevin and perry go large. south park is the most rubbish film ever.it could have been written by six year olds, thats how sophisticated it is.NOT a good buy at all.it makes me mentally and physically sick with disgust.I promise you you will hate it as much as i do and throw it into the sea."
1,This movie is just plain AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!,I CAN'T STAND THIS MOVIE! THIS FILM IS INSENSITIVE TO THE DIVERSE SOCIETY OF AMERICA! IF YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN KEEP THIS MOVIE OUT OF YOUR HOME. THEY SPEAK OBSCENELY ABOUT GOD! THE MOVIE MAKES OFFENSIVE KNOCKS IN PROFANITY AND SEXUALITY!! THIS MOVIE SHOULD ROTT IN STORAGE! THIS FILM IS DEMONIC IN NATURE AND INTENT!
2,South park uncut,If you are a died in the wool S.P lover...buy this...If you are not familiar with S.P....watch the T.V shows instead....NOT the greatest and at times very long and drawn out/campy......
2,"You want to see it, go to the video store...","Funny? Yes. But it is not funny enough. There are too many songs. It's practically a musical. Most of the songs are funny, and some are not. They say f#&k way too many times. And I could not believe they have nudity in this film. This movie is for adults and adults only. If you want to laugh to death watching South Park, get the episodes. They are much funnier. You will want to see this film once for yourself and not see it again."
2,Funny but disrespectful,It's a funny movie... but I don't agree to the way that the producers are making fun of other races/ethnics and other actors and actresses . BEING RACIST is simply NOT FUNNY !
2,"A few bright moments, but mostly just sucked compared to the TV show!","There were some excellent, hilarious moments in this film. But as a whole, it was not good. The profaneness was ""forced"" and it was obvious. At times, it added humor, but most of the time it made it stupid. The whole Saddam and Satan thing was just stupid and more geared towards a 14 year old than the usual, ironic adult humor this show is good for. Save this 81 minutes of your life. OR, better yet, watch some of the former TV episodes. Many of those are great!"
2,Disappointed,"I have watched South Park for several years now and maybe I expected too much of the movie. I found it a waste of my money and had I the choice on whether to buy it again, I definantly would not have wasted my money on buying it and would have just rented the movie. There were parts that were funny, but for the most part, I found it just stupid."
3,Dump the songs....PLEASE!,"This flicks been getting some very good reviews in the UK so I was looking forward to it alot,and yes it is funny..but. THOSE SONGS! the first couple were funny but then you get another,and another.....it slowed the whole film down SO much.So 3 stars,could have and should been 4."
2,"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.",I am a HUGE SOUTH PARK FAN but this thing STUNK. They hurried up and cashed in on the popularity of the series. Even my two kids wanted to leave the theatre because they were bored with it.
5,Hilarious and intelligent,"Apart from being one of the most hilarious films of the last ten years, ""South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"" neatly heads-off the complaints of its critics with a plot that savagely lampoons their misguided quest to protect the ears of our children from the satanic influence of foul language. While fearlessly advocating free speech and lambasting parental censorship groups such as the MPAA, this movie also manages to be a musical which satirizes the genre with some surprisingly good songs. Trey Parker is one talented musician (see ""Cannibal!: The Musical"" for his early foray into the genre). If he wasn't working in film and television, he could easily be writing songs for Celine Dion or Michael Bolton - and thank God he isn't. If I were a Hollywood mogul, he and Matt Stone would have an annual no-strings-attached $50 million allowance to do with what they will."
5,So very funny!!!!!!,"Even if you've never seen the show, this movie puts it all together. I didn't even mind it being a musical. Very explicit, not for the little ones."
5,Great movie,"Lots of people have been saying that this offensive to Christians, and that South Park is the anti-Christ. Lighten up, enjoy the movie for what it is, a comedy. Besides, the things that have been done in the name of religion are so much worse than anything in this movie!"
4,WOW,"This is a movie I can watch over and over again (not in the presence of children, of course). The more I watch it, the funnier it gets. Cartman is hilarious. If you're a South Park fan, buy it...MMMMM-kay?"
4,A FAN REDISCOVERS WHY HE LIKED SOUTH PARK,"I was leery of a south park movie....I expected to see an episode with the swear words were instead of a bleep. Instead, Matt and Trey did what the ysaid they would do; try to offend everyone. I thought they did a great job at it, everyone is so overly sensitive about everything that South Park is a refreshing drink in a desert of whiny people. Fabulous. I even found myself taken aback by a few things in it. THey calculated it perfectly."
5,The best movie of the 90's,"What other movie insults everyone (of course all in fun) has excellent songs an irresistably beautiful plot and best of all satires our own sue happy, too easily offended and over censored world? Unforetunatly, most of its fans have abandoned the show. I have heard that there are already plans for a sequal. Unforetunately most Americans aren't ready to see the truth that the show and this movie displays."
3,"I was really waiting for this one, and it didn't really work","I waited for months to get ""South Park"" on video herein Europe, and I ended up more disappointed than satisfied. Yes, themovie is full of hilarious moments. But I personally got tired of the swearing after about the first 10 minutes and thought that the point had been made. I am not a prude. This was baseball-bat-over-the-head satire about America's infatuation with morality. There is nothing whatsoever sly or suggestive about ""South Park"", and I know that's the point, but still. There are a few great things in the movie, though -- the way it deals with poor Kenny is brilliant, and the deal with Satan and Sadam Hussein is good for a bunch of chuckles, too. Overall, though, I really was expecting more."
4,Really rather good.,"Not only is this highly amusing but I have met some Canadians and they really do speak like that. Sorry, chaps."
3,a lie,"this is a cut version of the movie. the title says uncut, but alot of the best parts were cut. maybe in a year the nc-17 directors cut will be released. that will be funny to watch.they had to cut it, since alot of kids watch south park, and a nc-17 rating would mean lots of lost money.this is the light version. an R rating was necessary to keep the movie profitable, a nc-17 or X rating scares away adults and keeps kids out altogether."
5,One of the funniest (and smartest) satires you can buy!,"The title says it all. It is definitely not for the faint of heart! But if you like intelligent satire, I recommend it. One reviewer posted a comment that this movie is ""un-Godly"", I am a Christian, and I believe that God has a sense of humor (just look at the platypus) and won't mind if you laugh at something that is funny."
4,"Crude and Childish...It's awsome, it's South Park!!","As a true lover of South Park, I thought this was one of the best movies of 1999!The first 3/4 of the film was childish and hilarious, just as I would expect South Park to be. The last 1/4 of the movie seemed deep and mildly depressing. However, once you look past the swearing and the childish humor, the movie actually contained bits and pieces of many different musicals. Stone and Parker did an excellent job of incorporating fascinating mucial scenes into the movie while still keeping in the tradition of the crude South Park style humor people know and love. On the lighter side, the movie had lots of obscenities and just plain hilarious scenes such as Terrance and Phillips ""Uncle F---er"" song, Saddam sexual conquest with Satan, Cartman electrocuting Saddam, Bill Gates and Windows 98, and many many more.If you love South Park, this is a must own video.Also, this movie shouldn't be viewed by young children. Take it seriously when it says rated ""R"""
5,Hilarious and brilliant!,"I never caught it in theaters and begrudingly watched the DVD and found it surprisingly, terribly funny. The songs are brilliant! Raunchy beyond belief and charming and witty. See it... with your uncle!"
3,Goes too Far....but is hilarious,"The tv show has me in stitches, but this movie absolutely repulses me. The language just isn't as funny when its allowed to flow freely, and the creative obscenities aren't funny for very long. Still, Saddam Hussein is the most hilarious effect that you'll ever see, and most of the humor is funny, but this just isn't as good as the show. Please God, let there be no more South Park movies. The song, ""Blame Canada"" was nominated for best song at the Academy Awards. You can watch this movie once, but that's it."
5,"Good God, Someone is havin' fun makin' this!","Good! Turn the tables and aggitate the sensitive whiners of America blaming this movie for all the worlds problems. This is what we need for entertainment to watch a few foul-mouth third graders save the world from evil rulings of Saddam Hussein with Satan. Or was the evil rulings of Kyle's mom starting a war with Canada all because of a toilet humor TV show. Either way, the movie goes on with insult, blaming Canada for everything and insulting many Canadians (I myself am Canadian, took no offense from this flick). In the movie, ""what would Brian Boytoano do? For you Canadians, ""what would Joe Sakic do?"
5,Not for the easily offended!,This movie is awful...and I love it so! I am a big fan of the tv series so how could I not like this movie. It's really not a childrens flick but for all you adults out there... One of the many hilarious things about this movie is that they got George Clooney to do the voice of Dr. Gouache. This movie is a laugh out loud riot.
3,"I liked the movie, but the DVD is lacking","I enjoyed this movie. I found it funnier, yet it still made valid points about parenting and the rating of movies. That said, this DVD is very disappointing. Though the video and sound quality are excellent, almost no extras were included. All there is are some trailers for the movie. Where's a commentary track? A special on the art creation? This DVD would have been a perfect place to have both of this things. So in the end, you choice on whether to buy this DVD comes down to what you want. If you just want the movie, here it is. If your looking for a definitive edition with lots of extras...sorry, but you won't find it here."
4,AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR ALL FANS AND POLITICALLY INCORRECT,"INAGINE ONE OF THE BEST SOUTH PARK EPISODES STRETCHED TO AN HOUR AND A HALF. THE SHOW MAY BE LACKING A LITTLE LATELY BUT THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY PICKS UP WHERE THE BEST EPISODES WERE GOING. THE FIRST HALF HOUR RATES WITH THE BEST COMEDIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. I LAUGHED SO HARD FOR SO LONG THAT MY FACE STARTED TO GET SORE. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FIVE STARS BUT THE PLOT INVOLVING SATAN AND SADAM HUSSEIN IN A RELATIONSHIP DRAGS A LITTLE BIT. THE MUSIC ALONE IS ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU FORGIVE ANY PROBLEMS THE FILM HAS AND THE SOUNTRACK IS A MUST IF YOU BUY THIS FILM, ""WHAT WOULD BRIAN BOITANO DO"" AND ""UNCLE F*****"" RATES WITH ANY SONG FROM ANY MOVIE MUSICAL EVER MADE. START WRITTING LETTERS TO THE ACADAMY FOR BEST SCORE CONSIDERATION!!!"
5,"Loud, obscene and crude...And I loved it","While some people have written off South Park as a low(er) brow Beavis And Butthead, I tell them this. This is not Beavis and Butthead Do America people. This is the way South Park was meant to be, totally uncensored. If you are turned off by swearing in some movies(watch any Quentin Tarintino movie and you'll see), I still recommend this movie. While it does have the aura of um...dirty language(and this surprising fact, there is a swear word in this movie every 2 minutes or so), it is hilarious take on modern society. It pokes fun at almost everything we hold sacred, and well, everything we don't. It ribs God, Satan, Saddam Hussein, Jewish people, and even our Canadian friends to the north. Despite its shoddy animation, it really makes up for that with its very sharp writing and dialouge. I highly recommend this to anybody who likes the show and even people who don't watch the show. But watch it cautiously, YOU WILL BE OFFENDED in one way or another."
2,"Adjectives, I need adjectives... someone get me a thesaurus!","Apart from being a vehicle to bring the South Park kids to the big screen, the creaters of this film wanted to make a statement about free speech and censorship; thus, they intentionally attempted to make the film disgusting, perverted, obscene, profane, blasphemous, offensive, crude, and naughty. They succeeded.It is also, at times, very, very funny. But consider yourself warned."
2,Too much singing... not enough Cartman,"The only reason to watch South Park is to see Cartman get ... off. He does so in ""Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" but not enough for my taste. Too much time is spent on stupid muscial numbers and a hopelessly unfunny plot. Sadaam Hussein and Satan are lovers? Oooohh... tee-hee!! Big Gay Al is big and ... and does a Broadway number at the end? What a kneeslapper! Gimme a break. It's humor for twelve-year olds.Aside from Cartman getting zapped everytime he swears, there's nothing funny here (well, I admit.... making fun of how Canadians talk is pretty funny). Nothing satirical (unless Parker and Stone are satirizing how South Park pushed the limits of animated foul-mouthed kids... If so... whatever guys. Nice waste of celluloid). Don't bother with this one."
2,This movie stunk m'kay................,"Being an avid fan of the weekly Comedy Central show, I found this movie from the gross out kings Parker and Stone to be a major disappointment. The constant profanity and singing was so annoying I lost interest in the movie. The movie had some moments such as Cartman's theme about Kyle's mom and the farting duo Terrence and Phillip. If you hate profanity, sexism, and political incorrectness stay away from this movie m'kay......"
2,"Bigger, Longer & Even less talent","Don't get me wrong; I have enjoyed watching the show on more than one occasion. However, this movie is just not theatre material. Its just one long drawn out episode with none of the magnificence a television to theatre film should include! trey parker & matt stone totally take advantage of the viewer (in my respective opinion) by constantly indulging in their ability to 'do movie stuff' i.e. language.. Totally an immature comedy. If that's your bag, then by all means."
2,Keep the kids away,"Crude ,rude, socially unacceptable.Somewhat funny if bathroom humor is your thing. Foul language and flatulance for all. As the title says KEEP THE KIDS AWAY!"
2,Overdone and silly.,"Definitely over the top...too much so. Watching this silly movie feels more like watching a couple of immature kids wreaking an equally immature form of vengeance once given the smallest ability to do so. The swearing and off-color humor is so overdone that it borders on ridiculous, and it doesn't have to offend your sensibilities for you to think so. I agree with an earlier review; I think the twins have run out of steam, and more specifically, out of things to say. This movie seemed to be an hour-and-a-half snub at the ratings boards.And I have to say that the music is nothing special either, unless you're into novelty/off-color songs.This is a pretty silly movie that, while it does still display some of the subtle, witty social commentary I used to enjoy in the tv show, still buries itself with its own attempts at shock value. Disappointing overall."
2,funny for about ten minutes...,then it gets old fast. Hearing these kids swear for 90 minutes isn't all that entertaining. I am a big fan and this movie should have come out a year earlier when it was on everyone's mind.
5,One of the best movies ever,"I think this movie is great. Its definetly better then the TV show, which is saying a lot because the TV show is genius. I would really recommend at least seeing this movie, if not buying it."
