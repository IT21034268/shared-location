1,"Way too complicated of a game, takes the fun out of it","There is way to many dice, and may options on which dice to use and what it does for each turn, way to complicated even for adults"
2,Not worth it!,"Cute concept, bad design! This was one of my sons top picks for Christmas 2006. Were sorry we purchased it! The cans balance on top of a poorly made piece of plastic. If you breath wrong they are falling off! So, I got the job of holding them so my son could shoot them off. Yeah fun!!! If they had designed it a bit better it would be a great toy!"
2,Too real?,My husband watched this thinking it was free which it wasn't. I asked him if he wanted to watch more in this series and he said definitely not because it was much too gory........whatever he meant by that.
5,skill saw battery,"Excellant service, Just there part that I needed to make the cordless saw like new again.It was a factory replacement"
3,Hope it lasts better than original one,Just got this one. Debated to get new battery or drill. Decided to get new battery for about the same price as drill hoping it is better than orginal one which was junk . lasted about 6 months. Will see what happens
3,Skil 14.4 Battery,"What can I state - it's a rechargeable battery, and it works.It would be nice if there was a standard type that was used for all tools, e,g., I can use a D cell in a flashlight or radio, but I can't use a Skil battery with a DeWalt."
4,Rubber Knife from Amazon,"This makes a good kids knife. We give these to kids that want a knife. We try to give them a little information on knives, How they should be respected and the dangers of a knife. Try to educate them a little before they get old enough to own a real one. We do understand that some kids will be able to have a knife before others, but we work with all of them to get them to respect a piece of metal that can hurt them or others. We have had good response from parents and others."
1,missing target deklivey date,disapointing no response to myemail request so I have left the Hotel and shipment were rejected as targetted day missed
2,Not good enough for a stage prop,"I bought this knife after reading the reviews and thinking that I was getting a good stage prop. The reality is that it is NOT good for anything but a toy. The rubber is to weak and the blade flops around with even the slightest movement. The tip even bends and curls.We had to tape a stick to the blade to make it more stable and then wrap it with grey duct tape.if you are looking for a toy this is great - if you want to use it in a play, be prepared to adapt it or keep looking..."
2,flimsy blade; ok as toy,"It looks great but the blade is too flimsy. In my opinion, it is great for prop use only. I will not be buying this again"
3,myspace.com/barropanama,"i use it for training, specially krav maga, with this one you wont poke your eyes out. and itd be good for kids for the same reason."
2,Not what I expected.,"Flimsy blade and cheap plastic handle, I wouldn't buy again. The blade would be good, but when it bends it holds the shape and doesn't go back straight. They are bigger than I expected too."
3,Can't put my finger on it,"The film needed to be grimmer or even sordid, but was constrained by its time. I'm not sure Steve wasn't a little old for the part. He didn't look as if he was taking care of himself, anyway. Strong cast, good cinematography, adequate direction, ok script. Not crazy bout' some of the editing. Also, where are the Big Easy drawls? Worth watching, if only to marvel at the great Robinson. He was a New Yorker when it was New York."
3,This Book Takes Work,"To set your expectation, this is not a novel. Its a yearbook. If you are a fan of thesmokinggun.com and prefer to read 10 pages of telephone transcripts, rather than having a writer recreate the story for you, then you'll love this book. This is clip art and color copying at its best -- she includes copies of her own notes and address books, questionnaires from her girls and logs and logs of court documents and phone taps.I would have preferred to hear the story as told to an author, rather than this peek into her photo album."
4,A Creative Diary,"Thoughtfully and meticulously composed by Heidi, but with a definite absence of remorse or apology for manipulating and enabling addictive behaviors in her clients.Greed and flagrant disregard for the feelings of affected wives and families who are the innocent victims are conveniently omitted and ignored by the author who's sole objective was wealth at any cost.Pandering appeals to Heidi's I.D. that other persons are doing worse things, so whatever she does is irrelevant in comparison.Still,Heidi has a genuine passion for life and living that leaves me spellbound and breathless...sex not withstanding. She has inspired and moved me.I can truly feel my own addictive traits come alive while in her company and grasp."
4,Good for a visual reader,"This book is good for someone who likes lots of pictures. The information was not as a expected and I did not find the book interesting. But my colleges were ripping it from my hands, they loved it and that is why I give it such a high rating. I prefer detailed writing, so I would not open the book again. Great coffee table book!"
2,All over the Place,"This is not a book to me, its a scrapbook. Very hard to get into reading it because like Heidi it is all over the place. I would recommend watching the DVD featured on HBO."
1,Would not buy,I bought this item and was expecting it to be in new shape ... They are all sratched up and look like they are USED.
4,very creeeppy.....,I would recommend watching this if you're into sordid and creepy docs. This guy definitely takes the gold in the creeper olympics and the doc is fairly interesting.
1,Dispicable Poorley Made Film On Serial Killer John Gacey,"There is no shortage of excellent, dark and dsturbing fils and books about this personification of evil. However this isn't one of them. The film is rushed, predicatable and shed no new light on Gacey whatsoever. One of the most horrific stories of our time this film uses poorly acted re-enactments, poor production value and at the end of the day - nothing new."
2,Unlicensed Cementary: The John Wayne Gacy Murders,"An average video treatment of a dark and godless pervert. The video is an attempt by the director/producer to""cash in"" on the sickos that worship pure evil. And it's a safe bet that there are many of those out there."
4,EXCELLENT REAGAN BOOK,"I've read many book on Reagan and this is one of the best in showing the man. The author had a jumpseat view of history, and you'll finish the book being slightly envious of him for having one of the coolest possible jobs!It's clear that Mr. Kuhn has a deep admiration for the Reagans but the book comes off as objective."
5,Great read,"This is an interesting personal perspective of the presidency of Ronald Reagan. What a great read! Love the ""Coats on, coats off"" story."
5,"More ""Lush Landscapes"" Than Many Hawaii Videos","I bought this video to use as background while I'm reading, studying, or working. The scenery is gorgeous if you enjoy scenes of lush landscapes, and other scenes not normally found on videos of Hawaii. I tried it both with the music and with nature sounds only. I found myself wishing it had bee longer because it had some exceptional scenes in it. It is a little like a moving screensaver, but a very relaxing experience."
2,Lots of good advices but...,"Don't get me wrong, this is a nice book with lots of advices. The reason it scored lower is because I already read almost everything that was in it on ihaveanidea.org, in the 'Ask Jancy' section by Janet Kestin and Nancy Vonk. So you can imagine my disappointment when I started reading it!"
5,Great insights,"As a college advertising student, I found this book tremendously useful. It answered tons of my questions about the advertising world and agency life (even questions I didn't know I had), and it offers a ton of tips to stand out in the crowd and get your foot in the door. Bottom line: Don't buy this book, because it'll keep me ahead of you."
1,egotistical for sure,"Luckily, I was given this CD free. It reeks of egocentricity. Hey man, don't waste your hard earned bucks. Buy a national act and you will get your moneys worth. Typical of unknowns who dream but never achieve. Yes, I have no patience for mediocrity. Heard it all before. Ingmire should listen to himself for once."
3,As advertised.,"I bought this album as a gift, never did hear if she liked it or not. probably not, so who knows?"
4,music,Music is a very personal choice - I liked this alot - but we all have very different music choices - don't we !?! Expolre music !
5,Polaroids: A Greatest Hits Collection,FABULOUS! Love Shawn Colvin's music and this is a great collection of her hits. A Must for any music library.
4,Great Technical manual on how to do Import/Export,"Found this one to be well done, but a little more technical than I prefer. This book does include just about every bit of info you will need, from forms to products to making the right overseas and domestic connections. Also look at Import/Export: How to Get Started in International Trade."
3,Baby steps,"This book is fine for the very early entrepreneur. There is an entire chapter on choosing between forms of organization, buying office supplies and creating a logo. It's a good birds-eye-view of the import/export process, however, if you are a professional seeking insights and business solutions, you will not find many new ideas here."
4,A great primer...and that's about it: a primer,"This book is a good way to start learning about international trade. The information you read in this book will help you throughout your venture. Keep in mind, however, that this book is only a beginer's book. You will need to aquire a lot more knowledge before you will be ready to dive into the international trade pool."
3,CD not bad. note: possible track listing error above!,"Traveling without any music, I grabbed this at Virgin, not knowing anything about it other than that the cover was a pretty color - what can I say - I love orange!Normally I wouldn't review such a casually used product, but after dropping in to see if had been reviewed, I noticed that Amazon's track listing skips Track 4 - L'amour à la franaise, which in my opinion was the best song on this CD and thus worth mentioning (La sécurité de l'emploi and Mon père etait tellement de gauche are also not bad). I'm not really into reggae, which dominates the rest of the album, so at the point when some of you get excited and take out your bud, I lose interest and take out my [ear]buds.It's remotely possible that this is a different version of the CD, but if you are looking for that song, I'd bet you'd find it on this album."
5,Pemplemousse Mecanique,"My son found this on the French iTunes site and loved it. Fun music, all in French."
4,The Greatest!!!!!,"This is like a dream come true.I bought this just yesterday and I soon loved it. My cousin bought this called ""video now"" and it totally stunk.Imean it was in black and white. but this is in full color and it is also the best thing that nintendo did ever!"
4,"Good, as a video.","This video is cool. Much better than Video Now. You don't have to get a player and it's in color. Yes, the episodes are mixed up. That dosen't really matter does it? The only bad thing is the graphics/picture is a little bad. If you like the TV show, get this. Do NOT get the game based on the TV show. They usually aren't that fun."
5,Great for when there is no electricity!,I got this last year in the Bahamas. Somedays when there was nothing to do my brother and I watched the Spongebob episodes. I am not a big 1st season fan but how can you hate Spongebob? I noticed that while I was watching it that the graphics would mess up a little. But you should buy it. Because on days when we lose electricity I just turn it on and watch it till it comes back on. Do not think that it will last for hours. There are only 4 episodes. That means it only lasts an hour.But still it is a good price and a entertaining thing.Hope this helps!
4,45 mins of Spongebob fun,"Quick and simple, same short clips you see on tv. Graphics aren't bad but could use some improvement. If they could put more episodes in the cartridges it would be great. Seems to go by really quick before you have to change the cartridge again. If you can, buy used. Paying full price is not worth it."
4,"Easy, quick, read not requiring much thought","Blood and Memory is a quick, uncomplicated read. Although it is predicable and the characters are often derivative, there are some cute/interesting parts, and it is well written. I got my copy used and was happy with it compared to what I paid for it. I'm not sure it is worth $7.99 and the trade price is to high."
2,"decent ideas, bad writing","My history teacher in high school had a word she wrote in red ink on my essays when she knew I wasn't writing to the best of my ability: trite!The author needs a ""trite"" in red ink on every page. Maybe it was testament to McIntosh's storyline that I finished the book (as well as book 1--although I won't be continuing on to book 3). The premise (a murder victim cursed to possess the body of his killer) is interesting. Ultimately, the trite (I'll use it again) writing style completely hampers any development of this idea whatsoever. I could say that this should be filed under Young Adult, but young adults are going to English class every day and would also be writing in red ink in the margins. It was a sad (but easy) decision to abandon the characters in this series and forego reading the third book. If book 3 is anything like the first two, I'm sure I won't be missing much character development."
2,Promise of book 1 dies horrible agonizing death.,"The first book in this trilogy started well with interesting charecters, new ideas for motivating the protagonist, and at least a semi-original plot tool. Every ounce of potential is ruined by this second book. Both the hero and villain become as one dimensional as the paper they are printed on. All characters in the book become both blindingly intuitive and amazingly dense depending on what the author needed for an outcome in a given scene. Someone who can spot a certain trap from miles off in one scene mindlessly falls victim to a second trap in another. The unique plot tool is used once to achieve something that could have been profound or at least interesting but the way the scene is contrived to use it is so ludicrous that it spoils the effect. One can hope that her next book will avoid these pitfalls but this one is doomed to garage sales and remainder piles."
2,just okay..,"Picked up this book for it's potential from the first book. I finished it, but definately lets say it was a struggle. The main characters seems to fall into the same mistakes that failed them in the first book. Do they ever learn from their mistakes? None of the characters seems to really do anything (besides celimus) other than just talk about their problems and after they talk about it the baddie just comes along knowing everything and makes them have more things to talk about. As I've said earlier, Celimus is sooo annoying in his 1 dimensionality that it makes me sick. I wanted to really like this book for what it could had been!!! Really!! I tried!!2 1/2 stars"
4,"Informative, but author wears heart on sleeve","This is a fascinating look at papal elections.Hebblewaithe regales us with wonderful historicaland behind-the-scenes details which alonemake the book worthwhile. His descriptions of thelikely candidates, though likely to be outdatedwhen the actual event arrives, are informative.Hebblewaithe's own agenda tends topermeate the book; he seems intent to replace the""intricate and highly politicized process"" withan intriccate and highly politicized process ofhis own, to ensure the election of what he hopeswill be a more ""liberal"" Pope. Fortunately,this partisanship doesn't spoil an otherwiseengaging work."
3,Sound psychology,"The book consists of seven sessions designed to liberate the natural joy and happiness within the individual. It is meant to be used as a 7-week course. Each session consists of practical exercises plus inspirational messages and blank pages for making notes. The text is based on Lester Levenson's words, sometimes as replies to a series of questions, while comments and exercises have been added by Dwoskin. The technique is based on polarities, with the reader or student exploring two sides of the problem to reach a solution and to subordinate the ego to the higher mind. Not having done the exercises I cannot vouch for their efficacy, but the book has enough of value for the casual reader too and is a source of sound psychology."
3,Nice overview,"This book is a nice overview of the Sedona Method. I think the book reads a little more like a transcription of a seminar that was given. Most of what I took away from the Sedona Method is that you should ""Release"" and it seems to be completely based on asking if you ""Could let it go"".... There is obviously more to this method that just letting go -- however throughout their tape set this is the dominant theme. I applaud the organization for being able to create a whole tape and seminar series around this concept. Probably not an idea for everyone, however I must admit to enjoying listening to the entire Sedona Method seminar on disk - although it seems to work best as a meditation series versus something you can listen to while driving in the car."
1,What a twit!,"Oh, I felt embarrassed just flipping through this nonsense. It's hard to believe anyone working for a major network could be so vacuous.One word of advice. Check out a copy first (or a sample passage, if the publisher has the guts to preview it), then if you really like what you see come back here and buy it with the Amazon discount."
1,waste of money,"OMG !!! UGLY, UGLY people in this video...and some of the video looks like its from the 70's and 80's. what a waste of money and time....DO NOT EVEN THINK of buying this DVD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,I Can't Watch,"Coming from someone who loves Hendrix and owns nearly all of his releases, this really is terrible. the technical difficulties are real, the performances are uninspired and forced, nothing seems to go right at this show. I give it three stars because after all it is hendrix, but it is still hard to watch given how much i love him. the technical difficulties really seem to take him out of the show, which is a big deal for someone who is able to channel so much otherworldy grace on releases such as band of gypsys. i found the albeit inferior video and sound quality of live at berkeley to reveal a much better performance. For those who truly love hendrix, avoid watching him in such a painful performance."
4,Jimi Is God of the Guitar,"I bought this about a year ago when it first came out. I had never bought a DVD of Jimi before. I was blown away. The sound, the footage, Jimi's interaction with the band, was just awesome. This is a must for a Jimi fan. My only dissapointments were that (and to no one to blame) there are minor film blots on one song (can't remember which one) because of the improper care of this precious footage, there are a few sour moments and Jimi does have a few tuning problems that he takes up a little time for, and that Hey Baby (new rising sun) was not on the DVD but is on the cd (probably due to the footage quality.) None of this overshadows the incredibilty of this Hendrix performance. Don't take my critiscms to heart. This is one hell of a DVD."
3,Lack of focus,"I've watched some of Hendrix¡s best performances before. This is by far the least inspiring. He's chewing a gum, skipping lyrics and guitar notes. I have always thought Hendrix was the most expressive guitarist of all time, and I still do believe so. This concert is just a bad occasion."
2,poor,"I would reccommend any other live performances by Jimi, this is near his death and was not enjoying himself, he was not comfortable. Townshend has said that Jimi was a wreck. I enjoyed most all the live work by Jimi, the best performance is the full Woodstock set. Unlike the Isle show, at Woodstock he do no wrong. He's like the dove rising above the flames. WHen was the last time you heard, from the heart""Peace, love and happiness, happiness ya happiness""get it, play it loud, ya"
1,Frustrating!!,"This is the most frustrating video of Jimi Hendrix I've ever seen. What was the cameraman thinking? I expected to see Hendrix playing his guitar, seeing the man in action. Instead this is a lame collection of Jimi butt shots and facial expressions. This camera crew obviously had no interest in guitar playing. It's almost as if they were trying to hide the actual playing. Whenever I go to a concert, I'm fixated on the lead guitar. If that sounds like you, you'll hate this DVD. I give it one star, not for Jimi, but for the product."
4,The Real Jimi,I love this DVD; it's a really honest picture of what a Jimi Hendrix concert was. The backstage banter before the show is especially enlightening and it shows that Jimi was really sober and alert when playing a show; he was talking to a staff member and was worried about legal issues with the record company when he found out the show was going to be recorded. This is all music and all heart; it's not about technical proficiency but about vibe and feel and at that the man excelled and was a total genius. The interaction of all three band members is also brought to the fore as well as the loose interplay and improvisation. This is a must have for any serious Rock fan.
1,What was the editor thinking?,"What a waste! Great show and great sound, but unfortunately, 95% of the visual is of the back of Jimi's head. If you are seeking a film of Jimi actually playing a guitar, don't by this frustrating montage. Seriously, entire songs pass by without the viewer able to see one glimpse of Jimi's left hand. I haven't the vocabulary to explain how painful it is to watch this film. If you are some sort of fan of Mitch Mitchell, fire in on this one. There's plenty of footage of him. But the editing, for some reason, prefers Jimi's head and back before his hands. Horrible."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Dear hendrix fans,I will not argue that hendrix was a great guitarist, and a huge inovator, but as a live guitarist, he was out of control, and not in a good way. I am a guitarist, bassist, drummer, singer, and song-writer, and as an experienced musician I was terribly disapointed in the bands performance. Mitch Mitchel(drums) made a mockery of himself as he played like a five-year-old holding his first pair of drumsticks. And jimi's guitar playing was nowhere near the quality of his album work. The only song worth seeing on this whole DVD is red house. If you are a skilled musician who likes watching skilled players, don't buy this DVD!"
3,The Last of the Best,"Jimi was a gift for all of us to enjoy. Too bad there is not a great legacy that is worthy of DVD viewing. This is one of the few that gives us fans a look at the genius of the man with the guitar. One just has to overlook the lack of audio and video quality and appreciate it for what it really is. It's pure Jimi, to be cherished by his true fans. To the casual fan, you may want to pass on this one."
1,problems with dvd software that comes with film,"this is the only dvd i have in my entire collection that forces the viewer to download software.if you dont have an internet connection, you cant watch it. if you do have a connection, well...the add on software never worked. it makes you register and go to a web site, which then just says error.needless to say, ive never been able to watch this dvd. nowhere on the packaging does it say that the dvd cannot be watched on a computer without the crappy software.in my opinion this is a major mistake on the part of the distributor.im assuming if you watch it on a tv with a dvd player it will prob. work, but if u only have a computer you may have problems."
3,Rerelease or one more time,"Enough of the Re-releases already. Any reason why this wasn't done with the first release? Of course,MONEY. Newly discovered footage of Hey Joe. Where was it hiding? Any reason why it wasn't put into the concert footage? When the footage (newly discovered?) of Midnight Lightning and Hey Baby are found we can expect yet another re-release along with the two songs missing from Woodstock for yet another re-release. Come on Sony give us Royal Albert Hall, Miami Pop, Atlanta Pop or even Stockholm would be a welcome surprise."
4,Live at the Isle of Wight,"While there were not many videos from this era in rock music, this is a good one. Jimi's performance was actually too good for this particular crowd. They're level of appreciation was deplorable. Maybe they were expecting folk music?"
5,Missing songs,"the songs HEY BABY, HEY JOE & MIDNIGHT LIGHTNING are rocking on the CD. an absolute dissappointment that footage for the same on the DVD is missing. would have loved to see those performances"
1,Collar battery don't last,"The battery in the collar only last for few days, if you forget to recharge your dogs will run away. It's a shame because the fence was ok but this battery problem just make everything very inconvenient."
2,Ultra Smart system good collar BAD,"The system itself is great, however how the company is continuing to sell this system with the collar technology and stay in business is beyond me. I have sent one back and have another on in the waiting to send back. Because of that fact other collars are not interexchangeable with this system your sol. If I did not have so much money invested in the ""system"" I would just get something else."
3,Tchaikovsky maravillosamente ruso,"En el mundo de las obras sinfónicas es la primera vez que se tiene en un solo disco tres obras de la magnitud de las que contiene este BD, lo cual es excelente y apropiado.La calidad de la filmación de la cuarta es defectuosa en los primeros planos, en la velocidad en el cambio de imágenes y en el enfoque del director. Estos defectos se corrigen en las otras dos sinfonías aunque se mantiene algunas veces la imagen fija, especialmente del director, para pasar de una escena a otra.Sin duda las obras de compositores rusos con directores rusos y orquestas rusas produce efectos sonoros magníficos que no se encuentran en otras grabaciones. En esta grabación prima lo emotivo nacional y el detalle de sonidos instrumentales que no se escuchan en otras versiones.No se entiende muy bien las razones por las que los subtítulos del bono no están en español y ni que decir de folleto que acompaña el disco."
4,Sweet blues,"A great guitar player with beautiful tone. Not a bad voice either. I'd give the album five stars, except that there are a few songs that don't really do it for me. On the whole though, great stuff"
4,"Good, basic, easy to prepare recipes","This is a good cookbook for people with limited time. The recipes are easy to follow, and I have not had one turn out wrong yet. The dishes are not fancy and not always low fat, but they are tasty and appealing. Directions are well written. Each recipe has its own photograph, and, contrary to other cookbooks, the finished dish actually LOOKS like the photo. The authors also include some general pasta cooking hints and ideas for making ingredient substitutions. A good choice for a basic pasta cookbook."
5,Their debut album is solid.,"this album not only celebrates the art of turntablism but also black music in a positive light. They perform beat juggling and lots of unexpected delights. Check out Musica Negra which is one of their highlights and you will see what I mean. Of course, one looks forward to their next album and hope that they produce a solid album with unique beats as before..."
4,Excellent,"I would give this 4.5 stars if I could-----this album is excellent----The production is top-notch----and Swift, Roc, Eclipse and Sin are incredible on the wheels of steels------ the samples used on this album are diverse---and amazing----from tv shows to rock breaks----anything and everything----basically---The vocals on he albums are also solid----But this is a must for any true Hip-Hop head-----"
3,lacking performance,"I couldn't agree more with Santa Fe Listener. The sonics are poor, and the interpretation, no matter how good could be, can never overcome that. If you measure this Third against, for instance, Chailly/COAmsterdam, anyone can realise what I mean."
1,Repackaged and damaged,Maybe it's just my luck but I got a damaged product. One of the red plug has been scrapped to the wire. At $2.50 it's not work me sending it back. I uploaded a snapshot of the damage to the product picture thing.Be careful when buying this.
3,Cable does what its supposed to do. A bit flimsy.,"[...]It is exactly what you expect for the price. Cable a bit thin for hi-fi applications, but otherwise it does exactly what you want it to do. A long RCA cable."
5,"Thorough, Meticulous and fascinating!",The author - a former Special Forces Soldier and combat veteran himself has done a fine job in presenting the Special Forces of the world in an interest and informative manner. A must read for anyone researching the Special Forces of the world - their missions and capabilities.The book is written with an understanding that comes from being an insider to the SF community as well as a long time soldier. It is not only a fascinating read - it is also a valuable research tool. Highly recommended!
2,"a few new songs, but mostly a re-hash","Not what the other two reviews would have you believe. Most of it is remakes of old (and by remake I mean recycled from another DJ/remixer) songs and tired horns. Not worth the money, folks."
1,"Insipid songs + Bad accompanying music + No words on screen + No subttiles. So, very difficult to sing along.","The disc's title says ""Sing-a-long Baby Boost"" but it does not have subtitles or words displayed on screen. That makes it very difficult for the teachers of parents who want to sing along to encourage the kids to sing.The songs are not interesting. The accompanying music is very poor. It sounds like something played by a beginner.In short, this DVD is not worth it compared to others of the same genre, i.e. VeggieTales Live! Sing Yourself Silly"
1,Et in Arcadia ergo....,"...but only if you watch the TV version. This is a pathetic remake. The acting is lousy, the script a 'Reader's Digest' version of the epic novel, and the cinematography abominable. The sets are nice...except they, too are borrowed from the Granada version. It's the same house, same everything. Waugh's book deserves a long, detailed version, and 1981 masterpiece was as nearly perfect as one can possibly expect. So the question is begged, as other reviewers have posed: Why? What was the point of remaking a classic? I don't get it. Somethings are best just left alone. We are not amused."
2,Depressive and ugly tone,"It is probably about 15 years since I read the book so I can't really say with any degree of accuracy whether this adaption is faithful to the book but I think I would have remembered some elements which take the epicentre of this adaption. I don't at all recall homosexuality being such a grand theme in the piece - am I misremembering? Further, Catholicism is depicted as the religion for those who suffer from a massive and morbid guilt complex - surely this was not the main theme of the book? In all, whilst some of the scences are beautifully done cinematatographically speaking, I would say the undercurrent if not overcurrent is one of supreme ugliness and depression."
2,Remakes are seldom better than the original ...,"This version of Brideshead Revisited is a pale shadow of the original, which was aired on the BBC in the early 1980's. The original was longer, allowing more depth to the story. It also starred top talent actors, such as Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, Sir John Gielgud and Sir Laurence Olivier. It is hard to compete with this group. By comparison, the leads in this new version deliver wooden and shallow performances. If you want to try an interesting comparison, view a scene featuring Sebastian from the original, and view the same scene in the new version. Anthony Andrew's facial expressions, voice and demeanor are levels above what Ben Whishaw is able to portray. If you are interested in period English pieces, watch the best and buy the original."
3,English classics,This is re-make of English classic that is not as good as the original one even though Emma Thompson's performance is outstanding.
2,Not the Brideshead I Expected !!,"I have to agree with Martin from the Netherlands, this is not a Brideshead I want to re-visit. I would never have finished watching it if not for the locations/scenes, costumes. I decided on the two stars for those things alone. I greatly admire Emma Thompson, but she was not given great writing here. In fact, I think it was the writing for all the characters that simply wasn't there....They all come off as boring and uninteresting. Spend your money on something else. If the jacket photo appeals to you, try buying Gosford Park."
2,Middlebrow Telanovela,"Evelyn Waugh's ""Brideshead Revisited"" is one of the great English novels of the Twentieth Century. The novel follows the fortunes of an aristocratic family in the years between the two world wars. Brideshead Revisited has powerful things to say about the intersection of love and religious faith. The first film adaption of the novel aired on PBS' Masterpiece Theater in the early 1980's. Many long time fans of Masterpiece Theater consider the eleven hour series to be the finest one that has ever aired on the program.The screenwriter of this current version faced a very difficult task in reducing a complex novel of ideas into a two hour film. Unfortunately, the screenwriter was not up to the task. At its core, Brideshead Revisited is about religious faith. This current version reduces the story to a middlebrow telanovela. Waugh's Brideshead Revisited is a great story and I would recommend investing the time to read the novel or watch the Masterpiece Theater adaption."
2,What a mess. Sorry Evelyn; they missed the point.,"If you have not recently read the book or seen the 1981 TV production, do not watch this movie. I had just listened to an audio version of the book before watching this, and it was difficult to watch this.This adaptation is an atrocity. Evelyn Waugh's great masterpiece of coming of age and discovery of faith, a poetic and religious book, is transformed into a anti-religious/homosexual tract. It is made to be contrary to the theme of the book.The actors are professional and credible, but I thought they were miscast with the exception of Julia. (She was cute in her bobbed hair and a unattractive when appropriate.) Even Emma Thompson is inappropriate in her role.The visuals are good, and some individual scenes are admirable. However, the liberties that are taken with the plot details and language are offensive to the senses and dishonor a beautiful book. Dreadful production, it was a overlong propaganda piece for 21st Century Political Correctness."
2,"Skip this version, go for the original!","The original story, and the very long BBC adaptation, are worth your time and effort. While this version of the story makes use of a stunning estate, has a gorgeous scene of the entry into Venice, and incorporates more of the ""catholic"" trappings (the singing in the chapel) - overall - the book falls flat. The strongest character is Lady Marchmain - Emma Thompson alone makes this worth watching. All the other characters get short-changed - Sebastian doesn't come across as a ""man boy"" - just a whiny, petulant boy. We don't really see the magnetism between Charles & Julia - and certainly, the fabulous Antony Blanche gets very little time at all - in the other version, we get to see much more of his character who plays a role weaving in and out over time. I was also disappointed in the Morocco scene & Sebastian's demise - what a let down! Skip this and go right to the BBC version. Jeremy Irons is really a much better actor than Matthew Goode, hands down."
1,Cringe-inducing Melodrama,"IMHO, Howard Holley's review ""Brideshead Disfigured"" is the best of the many very fine reviews accurately rating the 2008 remake as abysmal. With great terseness and clarity he lists most of the faults that turn the remake into a cringe-inducing melodrama. The only further criticism of the 2008 film I would add is the brainless, ham-fisted elimination and/or mangling of Waugh's dialog and narration. I waited in vain for even one of Waugh's inimitable lines. All gone. Want an excellent read? Read the book. Want an excellent film? Watch the 1981 mini-series."
2,What a travesty!,"Yes, I am a huge fan of Evelyn Waugh's novel and the 11-hour mini-series. But knowing the marvelous cast (well, at least the older ones -- Gambon, Thompson) -- OK, I'll watch it. What a waste of time! Why did they bother using the book? Names and places are about the only similarities. With apologies to, I believe Dorothy Parker, Matthew Goode as Charles Ryder runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. And the actors playing Sebastian and Julia are -- well, let's hope they do better next time. Truly appalling if you love the book and/or the ORIGINAL. And in truth, even if you just take it as a film on its own, not based on some ""original story,"" it's still pretty much a waste of time."
2,Watch the miniseries instead,"Unlike ""Pride and Prejudice,"" Evelyn Waugh's novel did not shorten well into film. Instead, ""Brideshead Revisited"" is too heavy-handed and overt, losing the lovely shades of meaning that the series possessed. The scenery is lovely and the cast attractive, but if you want the full effect of the novel as this reader thinks the author intended, try the mini-series in the link below instead.Brideshead Revisited (25th Anniversary Collector's Edition)Rebecca Kyle, May 2009"
1,Loathsome. Abysmal. A bastardization of the original book and PBS Series,"Where to start?Emma Thompson was completely miscast as Lady Marchmain. Frankly, the actress looks uncouth and blowzy. The real LM is too controlling a person to let her body go to pot like that. (Sorry, Emma). ALso the screenwriter took way too many liberties that completely changed Waugh's plot and intention. No, LM was NOT snobbish about Charle's class and home. No, Charles did not live near the train tracks. Don't get me started. just don't see this movie if you want an entree to Brideshead and Waugh. Loathsome. Abysmal. A bastardization of the original book and PBS Series"
2,Second rate,"This condensed version of the novel can't stand comparison to the BBC series with Irons and Andrews. Sebastian here is too obviously gay and skinny and unattractive to rival Andrews in the other version. And Ryder's father here is completely uninteresting in contrast to the hilarious and marvelous performance of Gielgud in the first version. Lacking Gielgud is a big negative. The sound, at least what I heard on TV, is also muddy and muffled. Don't bother to waste your money on this."
3,Just OK,"Prefer the series on PBS, but having visited Castle Howard it was nice to see this magnificent house and grounds once more."
2,So So film but not Brideshead,"The film was lavishly shot and very nice to look at. The problems come with the story it is like a cliffs notes version of BR and an altered one at that. In this film Catholicism is made out to be the boogey man which is not at all how the book is. The film makers tried to emmulate Broke Back Mountain by making the Homosexuality very in your face and not just implied like the book. The actors all did a fine job with the little they were given to work with. The Book and mini series are far better they rate five stars easy, this can only get a two at best."
1,Won't revisit again,"Although the scenery, the mansion and the costumes were excellent I hated the story and was sickened by the main characters and their story line. Perhaps I'm not sophisticated enough to enjoy this kind of erotica."
2,Wait to see it on cable,It was not a film I will look at again. So I suggest you see it on cable for free when it comes out.
1,Dementia,Amazon: how do you discontinue something that was never released? When was a Blu-Ray version of this film available?
1,Brideshead disfigured,"Take a beautiful work of art, the original mini-series, based upon a profound story, Waugh's novel, and subtract beauty, memorable music, character complexity, subtlety, and deep meaning. Add modern sexual preoccupations, hostility to religion, gross stereotyping and a cast who have no idea of the characters they are asked to portray. Mix throughly and you have this awful movie. Anyone who has any affection for either the mini-series or the novel is advised to guard their memories by avoiding this perversion of the originals."
1,Not in the least true to the novel,"I have read the book and seen the monumental miniseries. This film has a not-so-hidden agenda that is anti-Catholic. In both the book and the miniseries Charles becomes a Catholic and understands. It was not that he wanted too much. He was in love with Sebastian. Sebastian drank, not because Charles loved Julia, but because he was lost as many were in his generation which was just coming out of the Victorian era. Emma Thompson plays Lady Marchmain as a gorgon. In both the other versions, Lady Marchmain is a suffering saint.The rest of the film's cast, except for Michael Gambon and Greta Schachi, are terribly miscast. The Julia looks like a drag-queen. Sebastian is supposed to be a beauty and that cannot be said for the film's actor.""Brideshead Revisited"" is a marvelous novel about redemption in a tumultuous time of upheaval. Give it and the miniseries a chance. You will be inspired."
2,Not very sudsy,"I normally am a big fan of desert essence products, but I did not care for this one! First, it did not suds up very well and secondly, it is really harsh. It seems to strip every bit of oil and moisture right out of your skin and hair. I tried using it a couple of times and couldn't stand the way it felt on my hands and just couldn't seem to get enough of it to wash my hair. I would skip this one..."
1,Lousy Toilet,We have had this toilet for many years and it has never worked correctly.it constantly runs. You see these little trickles. Our Plumber tried with out success to get American Standard to make good on this to no avail. Now the leaking is much more and we now have no choice but to replace it. It has been very costly in water bills. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it.
5,it's a homerun hit!,"Wow! How refreshing to hear 12 solid cuts on an album! There are no dissapointments here. Strong songwriting with depth, great vocals, tight harmonies. This duo is impressive. Many, many hours of enjoyment listening to this one."
4,Blue County are as country as it gets!!,Great debut by new duo Blue County. I thought Scott Reeves (Ryan)of The Young and The Restless was a good actor but he is a great singer. Who would have thought that. I love the first single the Top 20 Hit - Good Little Girls and I predit at least 3 more from the CD.
2,Not well designed or practical,This device operates on batteries that are not rechargeable and very difficult to find so it's not practical on a regular basis. The battery compartment kept coming apart on mine and it wouldn't work half the time because the batteries would fall out....The device appears to provide accupressure for the male G-spot but it doesn't extend properly so it doesn't do that. Forget it! Go with an Aneros or one of the motorized prostate massagers like the Generator which are designed very well.
1,Never worked,After a few tries this item never worked. Neither did the replacement sent. Refund was issued
5,Real Music!!,"K. Willis is a multitalented, singer/songwriter/musician. She showcases all of her talents on this debut album without overkill. She takes you back to when songs were powerful and had meaning. I have several favorites on this album: ""Hear It Straight from You"", ""Life-Time Notice"", ""Happy"", and ""What Can I Do"". I've also had the opportunity to see this woman and her band perform live! It was a truly awesome experience. She is a true vocal stylist who knows how to portray the character of each song in a profound way."
4,5 lovely lads from Cork that Rock!,"I recently saw Rubyhorse at a festival show and did those boys rock! Not only did they rock but, having met the band afterward, they're a bunch of right good blokes too! Their music? Synths and guitar riffs like everything from the Cure to Oasis to a dreamy New Order, the vocals floating amongst Bono, the Gallagher bros, and more American influences. And a drummer thats just so enthusiastic that you can't help but move to the beat. Sometimes hard rocking like ""Happy in the Sunshine"", sometimes creamy new wave of ""Teenage Distraction"", Rubyhorse not only puts on a great live show (see 'em if you can!) but has a killer album that will have you playing it over and over and singing like a pub boy with the Irish flu."
5,"Finally, a band worth throwing yourself into!","I have recently found myself completely sucked into 'Smallville' on WB. At the end of the show, they display the names of the artists showcased in that episode. Well, from an incredible tv program comes music just as good! I caught 'Sparkle' on the show one night, and was intstantly mesmerized. After listening to the complete album, I can't seem to put it away. On rare occasions, one finds an album where every song is good, not just one or two megahits accompanied by garbage, but a complete work of art. THIS is one such album. Almost every song is one I loved immediately, none really had to grow on me, and the entire cd is uplifting and thought provoking. The only disappointing thing is that there aren't 100 more songs. I and other new Rubyhorse fans (whom I feel I can speak for) can hardly wait for their next cd."
2,"Really not into it, songwriting weak","IMHO, just disappointed by the obvious lyrics and boring, heard it a million times melodies. I guess I should have bought the more depressing one. Oh well."
3,Not bad,"I was surprised when I read all the positive reviews for this CD. Yeah, there are a couple songs that are good, but I wouldn't exactly describe the whole CD as ""amazing"" or ""wonderful."" Most of the music is fairly ordinary or sometimes a little grating. I'd listen to it before I'd listen to Britney Spears/NSync/pop crap... but that doesn't mean I really like it.There are a couple exceptions. I really liked ""Sparkle,"" ""Evergreen,"" and ""Horseless."" They're just hidden in the mush that is the rest of Rubyhorse's CD. I guess I don't regret buying this CD - I bought it used - but if I lost this CD I wouldn't be completely upset.Just don't expect this CD to be something it's not."
5,Best Album of the Year!,This album is just brilliant. Soaring rock guitars. Driving bassand drums. Jangly keyboards and great vocals. This band have puttogether a debut album that stands out as one of the strongestcollections of mainstream rock songs in the last few years.There's not one sacrificial track on this. No fillers.Just 11 superbly crafted songs. A must have. Enjoy!
2,Did not like them,"I did not like the Icicle Ornaments at all! Thought they were made of glass like the ones I all ready have and turned out they were plastic with glitter all over them that just got all over the place. Looked fake on the tree, no where near as nice as the glass icicles."
2,disappointing:,Hard to mount on tree and shed glitter tremendously.Would be great if it did not shed.
1,Very Disappointed,These ornaments are NOT made from glass as the description indicates. They are plastic and covered in mostly pink glitter. They certainly do not weigh 1 pound either.
2,Glittered Icicle Ornaments,"I did not care for them, they looked fake looking. Nothing like the glass ones that I found and reordered. The glass ones look muh nicer on the tree."
2,Disappointing:,"I ordered these because the product was said to be made of glass, which they are not!Look pretty enough, but glass would have been much nicer.They also shed too much glitter."
4,icicles,I bought these with the smaller set of 32. Lots of glitter & very attractive. The only downside is the very small hooks that come with them to hang on the tree.Wish I had bought more
2,MESSY!!,"Although these look fantastic once they are on your tree, they are an absolute MESS!! The glitter is all over the container they come in, spilling out the sides, and all over everything inside the shipping box...Then, all over your hands, the floor (even if you are very careful) and impossible to get rid of. Have fun. Storing these again for the year should prove interesting."
2,"Strong, but small...too small.","These are mighty magnets, but 3/16 of an inch is too small for easy removal. Unless you have strong, small fingers consider some alternatives."
4,Double Cube Mighties Magnets = awesome!,"I wanted a small, unobtrusive magnet for organizing things at work. These were perfect! Very small, super strong, and I've re-ordered two more times since the first order. A little on the expensive side but worth it."
2,Poor DVD Quality,"I purchase this video new on a Platinum label. It is of poor quality and appears as if it was videotaped, slightly out of focus, from a movie screen through a hazy window. It is not widescreen and, in fact, the conversion to full screen is done poorly. There is also an annoying hiss on the audio track. The film would normally be four or five stars but, due to the poor quality, I give it no more than two stars, and that is probably being generous."
5,Lots Of Action,"The Story is about two families from different waring tribes. Each represents their Country's King, with winner take all as the prize. Three brothers from each side must fight to the death. Throw in one sides beautiful sister, who falls in love with one of the brothers from the other side and you have a story within a story. If you like stories about the beginnings of Ancient Rome, then this is the movie for you. Alan Ladd plays his usual smiling laid back self and is almost believable as a Roman and the eldest of the three brothers.Duel of Champions - Gladiator"
4,Perfect size for my outdoor garbage can.,"Perfect size, minimal junk. The opening of the bag is shaped so that you have four ""handles"" you can use to tie the bags up nice and easy. Buying in bulk beats spades any day."
4,a feast for the brain,"Based on the technique alone, this novel is a feast for the brain. Most if not all of the text was appropriated from various sources and is seemlessly woven together in bizarre patterns. The narrator is pulled along, forced to discover and re-discover him/herself and the family background as s/he continually switches from male to female and back again. It is disturbing, funny and touching, and often all at the same time. I read this over a month ago and I still find myself asking questions and re-investigating this work. A must-read for anyone interested in the avant garde side of contemporary american fiction."
3,Just how it is...,"This author came into my english class and talked about the books he has and will write. The books are an exact replication of himself. He is just as weird and strange and creative and confused as his texts. He is not trying to BE anything through his writing, that just how he is, he told us he doesn't even realize what he is writing until he is finnished he just starts typing and this whole load of (...) goes pouring across the page. He may be strange, and write strange warped things, but that is just how he really is. It's not his fault... :)"
4,cute watch,I bought this watch for my second grade daughter. She likes it a lot! The wrist band stretches and is easy to get on and off and is easy to clean. I do not recommend the velcro wrist band on other watches.This one works great for her and the price is reasonable as well.
4,Kids Timex Watch,This watch is great. It's fairly durable and it's very cute. The only thing that I don't like about it is that the band can be kind of itchy.
3,Not water resistant,Got this thinking it would be water resistant enough for a shower. Not so. Otherwise seems great. My daughter loves the design.
5,This book is great!,"If you like short stories, and down-home stories, this is a must read! Ms. Cooper takes you back with her stories and it's easy to place yourself in the characters she writes about. Very short book, you'll finish it in no time!"
5,Ms. J. C. Cooper NEVER DISAPPOINTS,"I have just about every book she's ever written and I am never disappointed. I had the EXTREME pleasure of meeting her during my sophomore year of high school - I'm 36 years old now. I was smittened from the first moment she read the first sentence of the excerpt from her book: ""Homemade Love"". I have been a fan ever since. She is truly gifted with the ability to convey profound awareness in such a simplistic and honest way - she completely enthralls the reader with every turn of the page. BEAUTIFUL WORK!!!You will not be disappointed. Buy it now - HURRY UP! :O)))"
4,A Piece of Mine,A great author. Introduced to me by a friend years ago...once you start reading you will want to finish.
3,Good Pan,I already have this pan in a differnt size. I wanted more of these pans because they work so well! The price for this product is the cheapest I could find with the free shipping. It works great! The only thing I didn't like was that it had a few small scratches on it when I received it. It was also very dusty like it had sat around for awhile.
2,kahuna3 chef,"Sent it back out of the box as it was damaged. But I did observe that the bottom of the pan was not thick enough for even heat distribution. Surface looked ok ,but never cooked on it . A bit pricey ."
1,Doesn't make any sense,"C'mon....what goes on here. Barney Miller was popular enough to have lasted EIGHT seasons. There's got to be enough fans that want to see the remaining 5 seasons. This is a waste. Any fan of the series has these episodes.No wonder people bootleg movies & TV shows, it's not right but Quit the marketing gimmicks & get those other seasons released."
1,Double dipping.,Get on with releasing the final season sets and stop double dipping. Better yet... figure out a way to sell DVD on demand... or just release episodes digitally.
2,Waste of Time,I agree with the other reviewers. Why re-hash old dvd releases where there are almost 100 episodes of Barney Miller that have never been released on DVD? Bring on season 4 and stop double dipping.
2,Not for a True Fan,"As others have pointed out, true fans of the show have no use for this release. But the casual fans might. I give the studio credit for not releasing this DVD before the complete season. That would be ""double-dipping""; this isn't."
4,Their Best Is Their First,I would say nine times out of ten any band or solo artists debut album seems to be their strongest. This is the case for Wet Willie most of their best songs come from this album. Wet Willie were a Southern Rock band but not in The Allman Brothers or Lynyrd Skynyrd vein Wet Willie had their own sound. Jimmy Hall the vocalist had more of a fuller soulful smoother tone. The music wasnt heavy on the guitar nor did it rock hard. The beauty of all the early Southern Rock bands was that they had their own distinct sound. The Marshall Tucker band had Toy Caldwell on guitar and used the flute very often. The best tunes on Wet Willie's first album are 1. Pieces 2. Dirty Leg 3. Beggar Song and last but not least the seven minute Fool On You. Recomended!!!(Pardon the poor grammer)
4,stormy dialogue and verbal swordplay,I thought this was a cute story. I love the simplicity of Heyer's works. And of course it's kind of predictable. It has a few twists and turns I didn't expect. I love the stormy dialogue. It's verbal swordplay.
1,snowglobe,I sent the item to my mom thinking it was a full size item... the picture wasn't the actually size of the item ....But she loved it anyway!!!!
1,"Wu Ma had better not ever be the star of an action movie again, or I swear that i will kill him","Wu Ma, what the hell are you thinking, you couldn't just pick out one of Woo-ping's brothers to replace you as the lead role. ANYONE OF THEM could have done a better job, you may think I'm kidding, but I wanna know this. Woo-ping was the MA choreographer in this, and I have officially seen the worst of Woo-ping. Wu Ma, you are alright in movies, but I'm gonna freakin fastforward Prodigal Son and every other small appearence you have ever made. I am gonna try and find a way to burn you out of all my DVD's, so I only have to ruin about 120 dvd's, GREAT"
1,Disappointing,"It worked well for 3-weeks before it died. Replaced it with a $6 Lysol automatic soap dispenser. Drilled a 1/4 inch hole in the top of the soap cartrage, refill with softsoap, and use a $.50 rubber stopper to close the hole. Still running strong for the past 2+ years. Don't waste your money on this soap dispenser."
4,Works well with Mac OS X,"This unit has excellent audio quality. I am an audiophile and the quality of sound is very important to me. For the price, I'm amazed at the output quality. I have had no problems with audio delay as some other reviewers have had. The only negative I have for this product is that the headphone output volume is a little lower than I would like. Otherwise, an excellent product for the price."
2,EMU 0202 USB 2.0 Audio Interface and Windows7,I bought a brandnew Laptop (Acer Aspire)and wanted to use this interface for some homerecording. I could not get it to work with Windows 7. There are no drivers available. I finally had to return it. Instead I bought Presonus Audiobox. Drivers are offered on the supprt page Windows 7 64 bit. It works fine. I had no trouble at all!
1,"Good sound, headaches with drivers, connections","I've had this unit for over a year. On my Windows Professional box, I had repeated dropped connections, shutdown and startup freezes that would only resolve when I unplugged the usb connection to the 0202, then having to plug and unplug several times upon restart to get the computer to recognise the unit. I moved it to my Mac iBook using OS 10.4, and it just froze up the computer completely each time I tried to use it. I'm having ethical issues with even considering reselling it on ebay, it's been such a problem for me."
2,"Good hardware, poor drivers","The hardware is decent: useful to have a card with a microphone in, line and headphone outs, and decent quality converters for a reasonable price. Note that if you need phantom power you should get the 0404 USB instead.Software is poor however. The driver is basic with a single sample rate choice that is reset to 44.1khz on system restart. The sample rate does not obey Vista's sample rate setting so this needs to be set to 44.1khz.More significantly, in the words of E-MU support:""The 0202USB was not designed to ""survive"" through sleep, hibernate, or stand-by modes. It will need to be restarted any time these modes are used.""These modes are standard and important features of a modern computer and you should realize that the 0202 USB is incompatible with them before buying."
2,Not what I thought.,+Works good on guitar with high impedance plug-in.-Noisy on both mic plug-ins. If I yell into the mic it will spontaneously cut noise out and randomly come back (faintly). Happened with different mics. I can't really troubleshoot if it's noise from the PSU or my USB 2.0 card.-USB chord was DOA. Had to use a spare. Tested with spares. Some chords created more pops than others but noise was the same for all. Get a high quality chord.
2,Not the best...,"I just purchased this unit and am disappointed with the features (my own fault for not looking into it enough) and the performance. As far as performance, the unit's Direct Monitor output distorts now and then for no reason (strange pixelized digital distortion, not because of a signal that's too large). As far as features, the unit has a headphone out, but no main output volume control. When I use it to send my Mac's audio out to powered monitors there's no way to turn down the monitors when the headphones are used."
3,"No windows 7 drivers as of Oct, 10",Looked like it was well built but no way was it going to work with W7.
2,Reconsider your purchase,"I made the mistake of buying one of these. Somehow the name fooled me and I didn't realize it was made by Creative as I've sworn never to buy another device from them. In this case my resolution was right. I made the mistake of downloading and installing the new drivers and firmware and the unit immediately quit working, now neither Windows or Mac will recognize it. Guess I'll try to get them to RMA the unit, wish I could get my cash back. Also, it took them 3 years to write a driver for this unit that would work under Vista/Win7 and after 4 years they now have a ""beta"" driver for Macs, so don't expect any continued support for the unit."
2,Not worth it.,"I bought this for playback, rather than recording. E-MU (a subsidiary of Creative) hasn't bothered to update the drivers for the 0202 USB in nearly three years. Needless to say, the drivers haven't been updated for Windows 7, and are around 60mb. They take forever to download because the E-MU website crawls. On my laptop (a Sony Vaio), I experienced the DPC latency issue others have described below: no matter how much I twiddled with the configuration, I kept getting pops and crackles. I also had to turn the device on, off, and back on after plugging it in for it to work. Maybe it works wonderfully on Macs and older versions of Windows, but I doubt it. If you're looking for a good USB DAC at this prince range, consider the Nuforce uDAC."
3,Less plug and play than it should be.,"This device is great if it is working 100% correctly. Even with the latest driver this thing will switch bit rates, or even block out bitrates. We can unplug it, plug it back in and the driver will only allow it to run at 16bit 44.1khz, you then have to unplug again and replug to get it to accept other bit rate/depth settings. Also, the lack of Linux support really was a killer. Initially we really wanted something to dedicate to an Ubuntu Studio box, but in the end it gets plugged in part time to a Windows 7 machine."
1,Problems when connetcted to a laptop (DELL M4400),"Consistently with some other reviews, my EMU 0202 does not work properly with a laptop (DELL M4400). I get crackles every second or 2 regardless of the source of sound (CD playing, audio files, playing videos while browsing internet).To make things even worse, I did not get any reply from EMU for my email reporting the problem. (Calling them is not use either, you get a message informing you that you should send email, which I already did).(Yet, the same card works fine on DELLs workstation.)"
5,Don't Get Much Better!,artists?!...writers?! ...doing what they love to do and a guy named jason and a gal named leanne deciding that it should be in a book?!JandL publishing is one of the most important publishers around because they are fostering creativity when most others are trying to cram some junk into a spiffy package. JandL delicately places beautiful work into a glorious vessel with white-cotton-gloved hands.thank you.
2,How many units does one get?,"The product may very well be excellent / 5-star --- but NOT indsicating / knowing how many ""units"" one gets for $ 8 is a NO SALE!!! Indicating UNITS for each item being sold should be MANDATORY --- A NO/NO/NO BRAINER!!!"
2,Disco Ball,"Very Small, would be good for very small room. The ball does not always move, you have to give it a push. I would spend a few more dollars and get a larger disco ball, this isnt what I thought it would be."
3,"okay, but","Jon is a good speaker and he does awaken certain areas that all pople should be aware of, but for the layman who may never get a handle on what holistic health is all about, the book is too hard to read or understand. He should take some pointers from the true ""Guru"" of holistic health who's books and podcasts have been educating people for years. Forget the Cures, Find the Cause is still the most readable and appropriate book for covering the true holistic approach to health. Books I and II should be the first read, and then you can add Jon's book for further reading."
5,Relaxing and Calming,"When a person needs a bit of mental and physical time out, and a relief from the stress of life sit take a deep breath and put on theDeep Still Blue cd and relax and listen......very calming and very easy to get lost in the melody and ride with the ocean waves at least mentally and in spirit!"
5,Brim Full of Information,"Tired of getting your supplement information from the vitamin shop clerk? This is state of the art stuff. Finally here is a book that both the lay person and the physician can safely turn to. The author has no axe to grind. He neither overstates nor understates, but is carefully objective in his presentation and allows the evidence to speak for itself. Dr. Hendler brings to his subject an open mind, wide ranging intelligence, and a rigorous training in all of the relevant disciplines. He refuses to be a shill either for entrenched medical orthodoxy or starry eyed alternative approaches. The result is a cornucopia of information."
4,PDR for Nutritional Supplements,"Very comprehensive, but omits some commonly used products, also lack of some detail pertaining to preparation and administration."
4,Out of Date?,"This five year old PDR Family Guide to Nutritional Supplements, first edition, Dec. 2001, is an excellent consise book and easy to read. However it is out of date when compared with PDR Health on-line. To get started this book is good. To get the latest information from PDR one has to go on-line and combining the two can be confusing. I'll not order until the second edition is released."
3,makeup case,"Im having problems with it. The back is not holding tight its very loose. When I pull it, it shakes. I only used it twice and my things are not heavy."
5,I am beyond satisfied,I am an MUA in the NYC area and i ordered this case...love it so far. It arrived on time and in great condition. It holds up very well with my hectic schedule and I would recommend it to any of my fellow artists. Bless!
3,"A verbose, drawn-out Updike","Having read many other rave reviews, I feel bothered by the fact that I found this book so shallow in character(s) and lengthy in descriptions. Seemingly endless meanderings about what took place on the TV some night, what was on the menu at a restaurant he visited, banal chitchat with the waitress, what stores and street names he passed while driving, etc. in lieu of plot movement or character development. I'd read two short story books by Updike before, finding them so brilliantly written, with subtly crafted plots and complex characters......but Rabbit at Rest seemed a padded,superficial story, with too little action or plot, and a host of characters (other than Nelson) that seem, well, boring. I finished it - an easy, fast read - but I found myself hardly caring about anyone. Did anyone else find this so mediocre??"
5,Life catches up with him,"Rabbit at Rest is a wonderful book, what more can I say?During the reading of it, I continually wanted to pass judgment against Rabbit and characterize him as a ""bad"" person, but I couldn't. Rabbit at 55 years old isn't ""bad"" - he is a product of 55 years of life and sadly, he cannot seem to figure out how to change himself and get on a smoother road to peace & happiness, even though he wants to, he should, and knows he should.Rabbit is a man stuck in routine. He talks down to Nelson, obsesses about infidelity, disregards his health, and sees Janice as a ""dumb mutt"" because he always has and doesn't know how to live his life any other way.This book makes you think about how many of us there are who just can't figure out how to break out of our routines, even when those routines are unhealthy and killing us. We're all scared of change, just like Rabbit."
3,Beware pages missing from book published by Fawcett / Random House,"My son has been reading the Rabbit books by John Updike for his 10th grade English class. Much to our surprise and dismay, the brand new copy of ""Rabbit at Rest"" which we purchased on Amazon in early December is missing 32 pages! It appears that we are outside the window for returning or exchanging a new book, so I guess we have little choice but to run out to the local bookstore to get a new copy.Even though I'll pay a little more, at least I'll be able to flip through the pages to make sure the book is intact esp. when it will have been published by the same publisher, i.e., Fawcett Books of the Random House Publishing Group. This has never happened to me before, so hopefully it is just an anomaly. Meanwhile, just thought I should forewarn others in case other copies of the book printed around the same time are also defective."
3,Not enough,"My commentary will be totally unoriginal; I'll just paraphrase Forster's words on a Bennet's novel which seem a fitting postlude. ""Our daily life in time is exactly this business of getting old which clogs the arteries of Rabbit Angstrom, and the story that sounded so healthy and stood no nonsense cannot lead to any conclusion but the grave. It is an unsatisfactory conclusion. Of course we grow old. But a great book must rest on something more than an ""of course"", and though ""Rabbit at Rest"" is strong, sincere, sad, it misses greatness."
4,Finally cooked in his own juices,"Another decade on and Harry `Rabbit' Angstrom is well into his middle-age. He's 56, overweight, and still living the American dream. He splits his time between the old home town in Pennsylvania and his condo in Florida. All should be well, but his cokehead son is running the family business into the ground and Harry is eating himself to death. As flawed and human as ever Harry is still struggling to balance his conflicting impulses. He's the product of an excessive USA, and consumes with gusto. His opinions are still modelled by the media and corporate American mores. Selfishness and lechery are still getting the better of him. And his health is suffering badly from his indulgences. But Harry is incapable of moderating his behaviour. He can't even resist his own uncertain daughter-in-law; with predictable consequences. And Rabbit is tired. He's swiftly wearing out. Finally he decides that maybe enough is enough. So long, Rabbit. I, for one, shall miss you."
5,great,"Highly recommended. Even has suggestions for pre-ceremony, processional, ceremony, and recessional inside. 2 different versions of Midsummer Night's Dream march included - one with trumpet and organ and one with a full orchestra. Lots of great selections, well recorded."
5,excellent selections of beautiful music,Some of the most beautiful music. Too bad we don't hear it more often than at weddings.
3,Okay but not the best wedding CD out there,"I bought this as well as Classical Wedding. I thought I would find a lot more songs on this CD since it was a double but I was really disapointed with the quality. Some songs are an ochestra, some are a harp, others a guitar. It doesn't make for a very coherent collection."
5,A treat for birders and lovers of folktales in the natural history vein.,"I purchased this book as a gift for my Aunt Jen, to whom I am deeply grateful for instilling in me a love of the outdoors in general and a love of birds in particular. She is now mostly confined to a bed and I wanted to get her a book on an outdoor subject she loves which she can enjoy while indoors. Before sending her the book I was able to get a good look at it and I feel confident she will enjoy it. The book is beautifully illustrated and the stories are well-written. All of them are interesting, some are humorous. I highly recommend this book."
1,Standard at Best for Stainless Steel sets,"I bought this set ($79) because it was apparently marked down from $299. Quite frankly, you get what you pay for. I was not impressed with the quality of the cookware. The two frying pans felt very cheap and the non-stick surface seemed old when put against the quality of non-stick out there today.With the above reasons I decided to return the set.Head Springs Depot, who is the distributor of this MIU product, wanted me to pay an 18% restocking as well as the return shipping cost! I had to haggle for a pre-paid shipping label, at the expense of an 18% restocking fee.so buyer beware.Stay away from all these products on the off chance they are not up to your standards, but my best advice is to stay away and look for products that are sold by manufacturers and distributors that understand that customer comes first!"
2,Wait to buy,"I went out as soon as I heard Fall Into Me and bought this CD. I loved I Should Be Sleeping. But I think there's only one more good song on this disc: I See Heaven. The other songs sound a lot like each other, and it gets old when you leave it in your car for more than a day. I would reccommend that you wait for at least one or two more songs to be released before you buy. I wish I would have just bought a single for Fall Into Me."
4,Emerson CD,"I believe I saw them on a morning show also. Which is why I ordered their CD, I loved them. Very nice listening and highly recommend."
5,Em. Drive touring with Shania - Great cd!,"This is a great album. I saw these guys in concert in Nov 2003 in Dallas, and man do they rock--and play great country! With their song ""Only God"" being written by Shania's husband, Mutt Lange, you know it's a great one...as are all the songs. They opened for Shania last year and will continue to do so this year when the UP! tour continues in America. Get the cd--you'll love it. Brad has such a powerful voice....you'll be dreamin'. :)"
2,Too pop for me. Where's the twang?,"When people say that Nashville has ""lost its roots,"" and that country ain't country anymore, they are talking about bands like Emerson Drive, a would-be N'Sync-style hick music boy band, whose look is almost as preposterous as their sound. ED's thematic range runs from chubby-cheeked, boyish enthusiasm to cheesy, overblown romantic sappiness -- nothing rugged or off-color, nor overly macho, and the music is equally neutered and unexciting. Productionwise, they thrown in everything they can think of, and see what sticks -- musically, they opt for a group harmony sound, but they do it rather poorly... Their high notes are excruciatingly shrill, a liability that is underscored by the weakness and unoriginality of their lyrics. Give me George Jones or Dale Watson... heck, even Blaine Larsen or Dierks Bentley... anyday over these monotonous teen-pop poseurs. (Axton)"
3,The Ideal One For 1 Person,"This microwave looks to be the Ideal one to have if you are on a budget,and it is small enough that you would be able to put it on your counter top.Wishing I had the money right now because it would be here instead of a picture on my computer.Thank YouVICTORIA SPENCER"
4,Very helpful for students,"I am an undergraduate writing a thesis on Vonnegut, specifically focusing on his moral stance in regards to Mother Night. I found this book very helpful, particularly the first chapter. You can download the e-book for less than $20, so I found it to be an affordable and helpful resource for my paper and would recommend it to other students studying and writing about Vonnegut."
5,A/B usb cable fits fine and works great.,I needed a longer cable to printer and this one works just fine. Cables To Go always has the cables you need.
5,Great cable!,I needed a long cable so that my printer could sit some distance from my desktop. This cable was just what I needed at a great price. It was shipped out promptly and arrived ahead of schedule. I'd gladly order it again.
5,Just right - if this is what you need,"Please be VERY careful and look at the picture before ordering this cable. This is NOT what we normally view as the 'generic' USB cable. For that, look for a ""USB-A to MINI-B male"" cable.The full USB-B connector (this one) is needed for some USB-connected disk drives, printers or speakers. A cable such as this may be needed because some vendors choose to save a few pennies and do not to provide a cable with the device they sell or one may need a cord longer than the standard 6 ft. or 2 meter usually supplied by the manufacturer.I am awarding this item 5 stars for price and quality - it's a good, normal USB cable and there's nothing to complain."
1,junk,"ya get what ya pay for! just received it today and every time i plug it in i get the ""USB Device not recognized"" message. tried it in a different computer just to check and got the same error message. pay the extra money so that you get one that works."
5,It does what it says,"There's a few different long USB cables. This is one of the ""non-powered"" versions. It seems to deliver as advertised. I've had no troubles with it."
1,"Cable doesn't work, waste of time","The cable simply didn't work for me: I got ""USB device not recognized ... some of USB devices has malfunctioned"" error whenever I tried to connect a printer. Since it was a new printer as well, I wasted a huge amount of time ruling out a problem with the printer or drivers, until I finally suspected and confirmed that the culprit is the cable. The replacement cable sent by the seller didn't work either, so I switched the brand, and will stay away from Cables To Go in the future."
5,Simply Satisafactory,"A simple product that does just whats necessary, it connected to my computer and printer and transfers data perfectly. Its quick and needs nothing special."
1,Not at advertised,As a USB cable I'm sure this is fine. But it's not white. Not even close to white. It's grey / cream / almond. I purchased this specifically because it was advertised as white.
2,Did not need this,"Came free with huge hard drive. Don't feel I should have to waste fourteen more words, handicapped as I am satisfying your review parameters."
2,Wrong item sent / ordered?,"Cables To Go - 13400 - 3M (9.8ft) USB 2.0 A/B Cable (White) (Purchased on 03/19/2008)by Cables To GoThe pictured used to promote the product (and even the one in the e-mail from Amazon) was incorrect, therefore I either ordered or they sent me the wrong tool for the job.The item you see to the right was the one promoted and the one I wanted. I got one with two flat connectors instead. It was totally wrong! Be careful when ordering from picture representations from this company."
1,Would have been great if the US Postal service didn't lose it.,"I'd love to leave a review but it was never delivered to me, it was delivered to the wrong address. I still haven't figured out where it went. I'm just glad i only lost $5 and not more."
2,usb extension,"WARNING: If you need to run a usb cable over 15', I'd recommend to NOT purchase a standard cable like this. I used this cable to connect to a remote powered hub, and had nothing but continuous problems with all my USB devices, which even interfered with my Vista OS such that the PC wouldn't even boot up until I disconnected all the USB peripherals, presumably due to signal loss over that distance. All my USB peripherals performed erraticaly with this cable. The product should include this warning. So, I have just purchased a USB Active Extension Booster cable which I hope will resolve the problem of signal attenuation. The cable may be adequate for a single remote USB device like a printer, but you'd be safer to get the booster cable to avoid the hassle."
1,USB Cable Would Not Work,"""Ordered a printer USB 2.0 cable from Cmple and it did not work, my printer would not print. I kept getting a pop up on my computer saying it did not recognize the USB connection from this cable. Put my old cable cable back and the printer worked just fine. Contacted Cmple and they said they would refund my money. It also took a long time to receive this cable after I ordered it. Be careful when ordering these low priced cables."
5,Does What It's Supposed To,I relocated my HP Photosmart 7200 series printer and needed a longer cable to connect it to my PC. Turned the printer on and printed a perfect test page. This cable works as it's supposed to. Highly recommend it.
1,My Computer Did Not Recognize the USB Cable,"This item simply did NOT work with my printer. Title says it all: ""My Computer Did Not Recognize the USB Cable""."
2,Didn't work for me,"First cable sent didn't work at all. The computer wouldn't connect to the printer. Replacement one has frequent connection drops, disturbing printing and is more or less unusable."
2,Disappointing,Not nearly as nice or as sturdy as the previous I'd owned. It lasted for 10+years. This one will barely grind the peppercorns. Not the William Bounds quality I expected.
4,A very mysterious and adventureous book,"The Quest for Tanelorn one of te most adventurous stories I ever read. This book was filled with worriors, giant energy-sucking monsters, mystery and adventure. Sailing on a death-ship to a place no one ever seen except in dreams. On a journy to find his long lost children, Hawkmoon found himself sailing on this death-ship. Another destiny-driven quest he'll have to conqure..."
1,Only last one season,"I have now gone through two of these units thinking that when the first one conked out after one season it was just a fluke. I liked them when the worked...the size was right for me and the noise was a pretty loud white noise which helps cover up the sound of my snoring dog. Due to the fact that they are not built to last, I am now looking for something different."
2,"worked, then died",Had it almost 2 years but then just one night it died. I agree with previous posters. It doesn't cover the space it says. About one room. Very loud too.Not worth it.
1,"Not ""care free"" or well made.","Not sure what to say about Hunter's ads for this humidifier.I do not want to call them liars, but they are stretching the truth a few miles.~This humidifier is certainly is -not- ""care free.""~The ""Permawick"" needs replacing at lease once on month. (I am on municipal water, but it still gets slimy and crusty)~It is not quiet.~The water tank is a pain in the neck to fill. (don't know what their engineers were thinking placing the handle on top and the refill cap on the bottom of the tank!!!)I ordered two of these in Dec. '04. Was very disappointed with the performance over the winter months. Just got them out today,Nov. '05, to fire them up for the season....the fans on both units are seized!Surely Hunter can do better .....I know I could."
2,Not care free,still have to replace filter and unit only made it 11/2 years just past warranty period won't buy this product again
4,Good value and quality,"I purchased one for my daugters college dorm rooom and she loves it. It is easy to operate, clean and is relatively small. I would recommend to anyone who wants a simple easy to use humidifier."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"We bought 3 of these last winter and put one into operation. Within 2 months, the motor died. We called Hunter who sent us a brand new machine. I was encouraged by the good service, but in retrospect, they probably knew they had a product quality issue. This winter we've put the other 2 + the replacement into operation. 2 have died after less than 2 month's usage. I'm expecting the last one to die any minute now. Don't waste your money on Hunter!!"
1,Save your money,"Bought this humidifier last year, what a waste! It worked well for the first month, then got really loud, a lot of gurgling noise coming from it. I kept it in the living room, and could hear it from the bedroom! Such a big disappointment! Now looking for a much better product."
2,'tis a piece of..... junk,"Mine lasted about 6 months. Put out about 5 gallons/day in winter. Loud, loud, loud, but beared it since I had already paid for it. I had to snap together the water pump assembly (a fan blade in a housing that pushed the water though a tube) on many occasions. Could not truly fix it since it is made completely of cheap plastic. In the end, the motor burned up and left the house smelling like burnt varnish for 2 days."
2,What a shame!,"I have two of these models. I purchased both December 2004, and one has just died. After checking it with a meter, my husband says it has an open contact somewhere. I am getting another Hunter, but they surely need to direct more attention to the life of the motor and have a better warranty."
1,customer service...a joke,"Last year I got this humidifier because I was tired of paying for a new filter every month or two. It seemed to work fine for that season. This fall I set it up, turned it on, and nothing happened. After going through troubleshooting with Hunter they determined that the motor burned out (apparently a common problem with these if you read over the rest of the reviews). Since it was still under warranty they said they would send another one out free of charge and it should arrive in 7-14 days.That was 2 months ago and still no unit!!!!I have called them back several times and each time they look it up, say ""oh, it must have gotten lost,"" and enter a new replacement order. I now have three different reference numbers, and neither of them has resulted in the replacement unit they promised. Stay away!!!!"
1,Runs for 1 minute then shuts off????,"I first purchased this humifider in 2009. Had to return it because the first one didn't work. The second one worked fine for the 2009 season. This year, set it up and it only runs about 1 minute then shuts down. I followed all of the proper instuctions for maintenance and cleaning. I will be looking for different brand!"
3,It's average...,"I'm happy this humidifier has lasted me more than two years now. I generally don't use it during the summer, but it running pretty continuously through the winter. I have to clean it fairly regularly and it doesn't really get ""clean"" anymore. It has certainly gotten louder after the first season of use, but I keep it in a different room from where I sleep and turn it to low at night. On last thing, it's just barely powerful enough for one large room, but not the three rooms I try to humidify with it."
2,"Ok, but lacking some features at this price. Durability questions.","I purchased this humidifier as a replacement for a similar model I had been given as a gift. That unit failed after two seasons. First the night light stopped working and then about six months later the fan started cutting in and out then finally stopped. When I opened it up I noticed the night light failed due to the wire simply rusting away. A manufacturing defect with not enough sealant around the wire.Anyhow, new unit seems to be running ok with main complaint being that the cap on the water tank is hard to seat properly. First few times it leaked a stream of water on to the floor.My old Hunter version had a sensor that would turn off the fan when the water ran low. This one just keeps running and the fan gets noisier. At this price I think that sensor should still be there."
5,Great humidifier,This humidifier is awesome. So awesome we bought two. I do not understand the negative reviews. We have had our first one for 5 years and our second for 4 since our first son was born. They work wonderfully and are so easy to clean and refill. Neither of ours is noisy- it is almost like a white noise and it puts us and our son right to sleep. The price seems to have gone up not sure why but it is worth it since you never have to change the filter.
1,Nasty,"We bought this humidifier thinking it would help with the dry house caused by gas heat. It worked fine for a while, no motor problems like the other reviews here. One day it started making a ""tinkling"" noise. Customer service helped us clean the little part inside that was causing it. Unfortunately, after a few more weeks, the mist started smelling really bad. This time customer service instructed us to clean the filter with vinegar water. We did a complete cleaning, running all available parts through the dishwasher as well. Never made any difference. The thing still stinks and makes me sick to my stomach."
1,What a waste of money,"Bought one for our newborn son's room about a year ago (just now got around to writing about how horrible it is). We thought we had picked out a decent model, especially since it wasn't bargain basement priced. From day 1, it put out almost no moisture whatsoever. Had it on high and still lots of static and dry noses in the house. And just like everyone else's review, the motor crapped out very shortly. After reading and experiencing how horrible this product is, we don't even want a new one from Hunter. Don't make the same mistake we did. We didn't do a review search to see it was horrible. If you're reading this, you are lucky enough to be doing a product review so take everyone's advice...DO NOT BUY THIS HUMIDIFIER. You will be disappointed."
4,Works well,"I bought this after trying four other humidifiers - all of them soaked the walls or the floor. This one works very well, and the large tank only needs refilling every few nights (I only turn it on at night). I use the low setting as the high setting is a bit loud, but the low setting is as quiet as any other humidifier I tried (I keep it in the hallway outside of the bedroom). Tank is very easy to refill - I like the handle on top to pull tank off, carry it to the sink, then flip it over, fill it, put top back on, flip it back over and carry it to the base and set it in (someone else didn't like this set up, but I don't get why you'd want it any other way). I have an electronic thermostat in the house that also measures humidity and the humidifier definitely raises humidity. Pretty easy to clean - I've had it for three years and it still works great - I bleach vinegar it maybe twice a winter."
2,Not happy,"I have had several Hunter products and they lasted pretty good.BUT,this one didn't made it for more then FIVE (5) Months.After checking into repairing it,it would of cost more shipping back in forth..I don't know what Hunter has done but not the same!I guess cut back on quality and charge more like MANY companies these days."
2,"ok, but not great!","It doesn't seem to cover as large an area as stated to start, but was ok. I had it up high on our large mini fridge so the noise wasn't too bad. The ""perma wick"" or whatever they call it collects calcium or gunk on it easily and is not easy to clean. I used vinegar as the instructions suggested and made it stronger and stronger until it was full strength, soaking it. I tried brushing it and it stuck like glue. We don't have hard water either. I only use it in the winter so it sat during the summer fine. Then when it was time to be used in the fall, it worked for one cycle, filled it again, and when I turned it on the motor wouldn't start. I heard a buzzing like it wanted to start but couldn't and then the buzzing wound down to nothing in a matter of seconds. Doh! It was only used a hand full of months! I used to have the standing credenza by another brand and I'm going back to that, triplets or no triplets in the house! LOL"
2,Unbelievable,I purchased this product hoping it would resolve my low humidity in my office. I filled the tank at 6AM this morning before starting work from my home office. At that point in time the humidity in my office was 22%. I checked the humidity at 5PM and it had gone up to 27% and used 95% of the water. I then put a call into the Hunter Service and support to find out how long it should take in a 300 foot office for the humidity to reach 45%. I was amazed when I was told that it would take 2 to 3 weeks to get the humidity to 45%. It goes back tomorrow.
1,JUNK,"Bought the unit Oct. 2004 and use it only during the heating season. It needs monthly cleaning with a gallon of vinegar and a soak time of approx. 3 hours. The unit is very noisy and gets noisier by the day. It now makes a ticking noise, which is becoming very loud. It seems as if the unit will self-destruct any day. I called customer svc. and as soon as I mentioned the ticking noise they told me a new humidifier will be sent to me. I need to send the old one back prepaid after receipt of the new one. When I receive the new unit (7 to 10 days) we will see if it is better. Kudos to Hunter for honoring the warranty 2 mos. out of date."
1,TOO LOUD!,"I agree with the previous review, that this humidifier was fine at first but grew louder by the second week of use. The fan rattles like a garbage disposal. I tried running it only in the daytime but that defeated the purpose since I need it while sleeping.Went and purchased the Hamilton Beach 05519 from J&R Music World and it is quieter but still also loud. But I'll take a loud HUM over a loud RATTLE any day!I'm mad that I have to change filters now, but supposedly only every 2 mos. with the Hamilton Beach. I will stay away from all Hunter products in the future because now I've done some research on the Web and it seems that quite a few people are having the same noise problem. There is a defect. Not only that, one model of Hunter's was recalled due to a fire hazard!"
2,sad really,"the story was ok, but the animation was seriously lacking. shapes of blank people and scenery and picture panning used way too much as animation short cuts. I found it very distracting. would have been better left on the pages of manga"
4,One of My Favorite Anime Series!,"I couldn't believe I got it at the price I did!! It's really a series you should watch and if you love it buy to own. The box set art is lovely and they're slim cases so it won't take up too much room. I only wish it had more extras, but still it's a keeper! It also makes a good gift to any fan of the series."
2,Visually good but sound quality very poor,Received in good time. Had to play dvd on computer as region was not set up for uk. Quality of dvd for visual was good but sound very poor. All I can hear is the music and the speaking too low. Needs addressing for next purchaser in the UK. Difficult to watch as it is.
2,Disappointed,"I was eagerly looking forward to the 2nd season of this tv series but was utterly disappointed with the series' development. I expected more ""action"" but the series, half way thru, went out of steam. It looked more and more like a family drama series than a sci-fi, suspense sort of drama. It lacked momentum like its first season."
4,This is not just for Teenagers,"I began watching this series with my kids and grandkids on family night. I'm hooked.The character development is excellent if sometimes slightly stilted. I can't help investing time and caring in them even with that. The parents in the series are just as caring and exasperated as most parents are, while the kids are just as smart and just as dumb acting as normal kids.It has not taken on that soap opera-esque way about it that most television shows start to develop. This one is a keeper so far. Hopefully this is a trend that continues and the characters will continue to grow, both as actors and as characters."
5,Kyle XY: Season 2,"Love watching this series! Always keeps you on your toes, and wondering ""Who is Kyle XY?"" and what powers does he possess?"
5,Whole Series,"This product is as described unlike many of the Region 2 versions out there. Purchased ""Series 2"" region 2 DVD in France & discovered it is only the first 13 episodes of series 2. In France series 2 has been split into two ""Series"" so other people buying R2 version probably need to watch out for this. This R1 version is full 23 episodes as expected."
1,don't buy it,This GPS does not have a USB cord. It is totally obsolete and can not work with anything but an old PC. I would give it half a star if I could.
5,Heartwarming,"I was first interested in this book by the title and the other reviews I read here on Amazon.Music has always had meaning, for me, and I thought it was really cool that someone wrote a book about how songs may affect people.What I liked most about this book is the strength of the characters. The relationship between the two sisters is unshakable, even during the most trying times.This book is about love and the ways it changes us or makes us look at things differently. Even about the seemingly stupid and regretful things we will do in the name of love. It also explores family dynamics and how any member(s) of the family unit can affect the entire system with even a simple decision.I recommend this book to anyone."
4,Well Done,"Lisa Tucker's The Song Reader is a very well done novel about two sisters, Leeann, the teenage narrator and her older sister Mary Beth, the song reader of the title. The sisters live on their own--their father left years ago and then their mom died tragically in a car accident. Mary Beth seeks to supplement their income using her talents as a song reader--sort of like a psychic, but instead of reading palms, she reads the songs people have in their heads. This story isn't so much about Mary Beth as it is about Leeann and her growing up. You will root for the sisters to succeed in both life and love in this enjoyable and engaging novel."
3,Quirky family drama,"Mary Beth raises her little sister Leeann after their mother dies in a car crash (their father ran away years ago). Mary Beth has a talent for reading the songs that are important to people and how they manifest into their own life.I fully enjoyed the family drama. How Leeann grew up sane in a slightly strange family. How we're all just finding our way, struggling to make sense of the chaos of life.Tucker's descriptive writing of the character of Ben was so good that I had a crush on him.The characters seemed very real.A good read."
4,Almost loved it to a 5,"I really loved this book and the author's insights into everyone's feelings until the last quarter of the book. The way it was tied up at the end, I thought was not in keeping with the progress the ""song reader"" was making in her life. Plus, it then ended really ubruptly. But, I loved the rest of the book so much I was still glad I read it and will look for more from this author."
3,A Promising First Novel,"Lisa Tucker's creative spin on finding love shows promise for her future writing. Unlike many novels that focus on disfunctional families, Tucker manages to weave hope into her pages. The creative plot makes for a quick read, but does not fail to still impress a meaningful message upon the reader."
4,"A young woman's voice, and lots of 80's music","Lisa Tucker has a gift - the narrator of her first book, Leeann Norris, has as distinctive and resonant a voice as Huck Finn, and as much of a journey of discovery ahead of her. My only quibble, and the reason I give 4 stars, is that occasionally Leeann is allowed to get ahead of her story, saying something like ""I assumed X, but I was so wrong..."" Better to let us discover that on our own as we read.Leeann's sister, Mary Beth, is also beautifully written. She is the quintessential older sister, protector, and empathetic giver who is unable to receive let alone take, and who nearly destroys herself in the process.The idea of songreading is both clever and plausible, especially when placed in the hands of a gifted, if untrained, therapist like Mary Beth. And Leeann's using popular music to indicate the passage of time (""Endless Love"" had given way to ""Tainted Love"")keeps music constantly in the reader's head."
2,NOT a 5-star book by any means!!!!!,"i ordered this book based on its 5star rating...it most certainly is NOT a 5-star book. the plot, if that's what it could be called, is silly, contrived and pointless. i expected much more focus on the actual songs and their lyrics; instead, we get a rambling, whining diatribe on depression. if the townsfolk loved mary beth so much, why would they be so quick to turn on her? and if everyone knows holly's dad is a total creep, why would everyone be so quick to jump on his side. this novel, while readable, is total mush best suited for a day on the beach. it has zero literary merit and will get under your skin solely because it is annoying."
1,A disappointment,"Who wrote all the reviews posted here -- the author's family and friends? If this book was specifically for young readers, I would have given it three stars, but as a book for adults it deserves only one. It was simplistic, overly dramatic, and the characters weren't believable. Even though I grew up in the 80s, and loved many of the songs mentioned, I did not connect with this book at all. There are so many other good reads out there (The Time Travelers' Wife, Life of Pi, Three Junes, The Kite Runner, etc.) -- don't waste your time on this one."
2,The Song Reader Skips a Groove,"The premise of the book is engaging, and the inner emotional frustration of the songreader's sister/main character Leeann is nicely drawn. But in the middle of the book, the author chooses an unbelievable, cliched crisis which makes the reader lose affinity for the songreader herself. In turn, the storyline bogs down, supporting characters become uninteresting and one-dimensional, and the reader continues the story in hopes that the writer will regain the reader's initial interest."
5,Disney Fairytale Princess Cups,"These are good quality paper cups. The princesses are very colorful and well printed onto the cups. As with all paper cups they begin to weaken when left with liquid for an extended period of time, but these cups held up well for the entire 2 hour birthday party. They were used early on and several sat with vary levels of coke or lemonade for quite some time with weakness, but no leak through. They matched perfectly the Disney princess table cloth, plates and napkins and I am very pleased with them. You can also find these exact same cups in discount stores."
2,Fabric color fades fast!,"I wasn't aware the cushions were made from fabric cloth when I purchased this chair, so I was surprised when I uncrated the box, but I hoped it was at least weather-resistant, something akin to the 'Sunbrella' fabrics. Not so. After only two weeks in the southern California sun, it's starting to look gray and blotchy. It's certainly very comfortable, so it depends if you care about appearance, but as far as we're concerned, bad purchase."
2,Not a Zero Gravity chair,This is not a zero gravity chair. I did a search for zero gravity chairs and this one came up. I must not have been paying attention so be careful. The position lock sort of works in one position. One arm rest cushion is coming off right out of the box. There are less expensive chairs that may better.
4,Couldn't love it more!,"This is a wonderful chair. First off, it is incredibly comfortable. I've sat in it for hours at a time and it provides the perfect chair to read or nap in. Oddly the material does not seem to get that hot, even in the sun, and dries very quickly afer a rainstorm. It is also pretty sturdy. I keep it outside 24/7 and although we've had some strong thunderstorms this season with strong winds I always find it standing upright. I also haven't had any problems with rusting. Overall I love, love, love this chair. I did a lot of research before buying it because I wanted something that would be comfortable, but not overpriced and I think I got the perfect marriage of affordability (especially compared to similar versions) and comfort."
3,watch the screws and bolts!,"Received 2 of these chairs for our deck. Very comfy- however- one of our first guests- heavy but under the weight limit- snapped the clamp. Called Faulkner and they sent a new one which we put on with difficulty. The biggest surprize was the guarantee not including rust. Well, guess what! The first shower we had, ALL the metal screws turned orange and dripped oraage on the deck!! Company stated they should be taken in before rain- UNREALISTC?! I have never had this happen to any pieces I have or had in the past 30 years. This includes four folding chairs - black frames with metal bolts and no rust- for little money at Stop and Shop!! Not worth sending back- disappointed!"
5,Life goes on,"I was given this book after my 19 yr old cat passed away, and I wasn't sureif I could bear to ever get another pet again. I cried while reading this, butthe lesson was a strong and special one, and helped me to make the decision toget another cat. I love that Cynthia Rylant has elder people in her stories-people who have lived a long time, and can pass on life's lessons in an honest,heartfelt way. This is a very touching story."
5,Who is Lucky's Friend?,"This is a funny story of an old woman who has outlived all her friends. She has big hair, cowboy boots and crazy clothes like Ms. Frizzle. The only thing she gives a name are objects like her car Betsey because they won't get old and die. She looks like she would be a fun friend and doesn't act old at all. She finally finds a shy brown pup to be her friend and must name him or leave him at the pound. I wish the old woman had a name. Read this book if you love Grandma stories or dogs.PS It's not sad!"
4,The woman who took a risk,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to lose every one you know? Read and find out how life is like without any friends in this book called the Old Woman Who Named Things by Cynthia Rylant.In this book there is an old woman who has outlived every one of her friends. She decides to name her car,her bed, and her chair. One day a small brown dog comes to her house.The dog has no name. He comes regularly. One day the dog stopped coming back. Will she find the dog and keep it as her own? Read and find out!I like this book because it shows that people should take risks and try new things. I recommend this book to people who have a hard time making friends."
5,Excellent,"This book is the one that I never tire of reading to my four year old son. He would have me read it over and over again, all day if I would. The book makes us smile every time we read it."
3,Would have rated higher ... BUT,"Received this amp very quickly. Great packaging.Unpacked it. Looks sweet.Hook it up, plug it in. No left channel.Rechecked everything. Switched all the cables. Still nothing.So I'm about to package it back up and send it back. Then I remembered reading a review that someone had opened it up, and there was a wire that wasn't connected.So I opened it up, and sure enough there was a very obvious wire that wasn't connected. Connected it, closed it back up. Plugged everything in .. and it worked. Awesome.Overall the amp is sweet. Sounds great for my guitar rig. So if you have the same problem.. open it up and check it first. Wasn't too hard, only about 8 screws, and the wire was very obvious and it was very easy to plug in."
2,No sound coming out to speakers,"I rated two stars because I am very disappointed after doing a lot of research before buying this amp ,I just received at home in two days shipping was awesome but after setting everything for a home party the amp was not working correctly music was not coming out to speakers ,we had to go in a rush to music store and buy another amp to keep the party going,so we decided to returned back to amazon."
3,Fey returns with a renewed energy,"Well for all of us old school Fey fans this won't really give us what we have been waiting for which is an album with a lot of upbeat dance tracks. But this album is a great improvement over ""el color de los suenos"". In her latest album Fey returns with an electronic sound but its not dance, its more like electro-pop. Given that females havn't really done well in this genre, this is Fey so new ground might be broken. Although the songs are in spanish it seems that they were written to be sung in english and it makes some of the songs sound a bit akward. A few songs even include the original english vocals. Some of the better songs are loca por amarte and bailando toda la noche. The production is pretty good so that means that a lot of people will love it. If your a fey fan you'll like it too. Just don't go here if you are looking for the latest representation of the modern spanish dance sound."
5,Trapped in the rythm of life!...,"Fey is back, and she is dressed to kill. After almost five years of long waiting, mexican artist Fey reappears with a double CD in English and Spanish giving the audience her best work (she wrote all the songs) and not only that, but a reflection of her life in 11 amazing songs. Melodies like Sé lo que vendra, and Siento Caer mark the new artist who has, indeed, experienced a great metamorphosis.You will love this album."
3,BUENO PERO NO TANTO,UNA FEY DIFERENTE A LA DE SIEMPRE QUE MADURO DE GOLPE PERO QUE PARECE NO ENONTRAR SU CAMINO ENTRE LA NIÑA Y LA MUJER... ALGUNOS TEMAS MUY BUENOS Y OTROS QUE CASI NI SE LE ENTIENDE LO QUE DICE NI LO QUE QUIERE DECIR... UNA LASTIMA
3,Very interesting but a hard read,I found this to be a dry read but very interesting nonetheless. A great insight into theories reasoning why we are sexually oriented the way we are. Id recommend this to people that are good at staying focused. It took me a while!!
5,Very good,"Contemporary, non-traditional bellydance music. Excellent songs I use to choreograph numbers to for class or performance. One of my fav cds right now."
2,informative,"This book begins with a timed self-scoring IQ test up to 165. Then follows an explanation of what IQ is, and what it means. Finally, it discusses giftedness, aptitude, and intelligence.The book is easy to read, informative, and contemporary. However, the test is perhaps too easy for adult readers, as scores are only adjusted for ages up to 16. Therefore, if you are older than 16, perhaps the test will not be particularily challenging. So if you want to boost your ego, then buy this book. But I suggest that if you want to challenge your intellect, then save your money for another book of puzzles."
4,Good IQ starter,"This book is good if you want to have a quick and accurate test of your IQ according to standard tests. There is only one test in the book and it is of the classical type. The test is very similar to the 'self-scoring IQ test' that can be purchased separately. Apart from the test with answers, scoring charts and explanations the book contains some basic information about how the brain works in left and right hemisphere divisions as well as some suggestions as how to train your IQ. The book makes a good point out of stating that our society is left-hemisphere oriented and most of the exercises - that are standard/non-original - aim at stimulating the right-hemisphere."
5,"I.Q., A Parent's Guide","I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and taking its included I.Q. test. Not only do I now know what my I.Q. currently is, I also know that one test does not indicate intelligence. Munzert is excellent in explaining what the test attempts to measure and gives insight into the development of one's intelligence starting at birth.Being a father of two young children myself, I found the text very enlightening and look forward to enhancing my children's awareness of their environment as well as working on their standard 'academic studies'.As an educator, I also enjoyed Munzerts assertions about right-brained individuals being 'judged' less intelligent because they do not think in a way that matches the standard educational system (mostly structured, analytical, and serial as opposed to unstructured and creative.)"
1,I'm sorry but the contents of this DVD is ridiculous...,"Don't get me wrong I adore Diff'rent Strokes, but I cannnot tell you how long I have been waiting on a release of Season Three onto DVD and instead die-hard fans such as myself are treated to this ridiculous release of episodes you can find on the Season 1 and 2 discs. Absolutely, completely and utterly criminal!Get your act together Sony and release the following Seasons 3-8 of Diff'rent Strokes and stop fanny-annying about with utter rubbish releases like this one!!! Grrrr!Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend buying this to anyone. Buy the full seasons. You get better value for your money for one thing."
5,Bewiitched - Fan Favorites,"I have loved this series since it came out in 1964. For the money, this was a great buy with some of the best shows. Recommend to any fan!"
3,excessive s&h,"I bought a number of similar type gag stuff to bring to the family Christmas dinner to make the kids laugh! Evidently these 10 different items came from 6 different stores. SO, the shipping and handling came to more than the total cost of the gag/joke items!!!!!!! I ordered from one place, but they were shipped from 6 different places!!! I didn't have the time to shop elsewhere, so I bit it!!! I won't do this again!"
3,A Few Misfires,"Bought this mini set at BAM and am happy enough. Has a rope included for two of the stretches. The minibook has the exact same descriptions as the cards, but I suppose if you don't want a deck of cards while simply reviewing the stretches, this could be useful. I guess orange cards are pretty easy to spot if they get lost (orange is nice enough I suppose lol).Out of twenty-five cards, three (Neck Stretch, Overhead Arm Stretch, and Forearm & Hand Stretch) were thoroughly confusing--description and illustration both--and one (Spinal Twist) was misunderstood as a fault of my own. If you buy this set (or start out in anything, really), please don't depend entirely on that first book. Review it, make sure you understand it, do some quick Google searches if need be. Then you can start using this portable little deck! ^_^"
4,Former waterborne,"Being a former waterborne soldier, I ordered both books by Bauman. Bauman definitely has related the experiences of a waterborne soldier and the experiences of a soldier transitioning into the civilian world. I was amazed at his accurate portrayal of reasons why soldiers enlist, why they risk their lives defending what others think is important, and the difficulty of transitioning into the civilian world. Memories came flooding back when he mentioned the Gasthaus and experiences in the barracks.. Experiences mentioned are very truthful. Although fictional, Bauman has captured the essence of the waterborne soldier."
5,Good stuff!,"Got this case to replace one that was ""accidentally"" taken when I got offloaded.I drive a small truck for a living and use this case to store my ratchet straps and my gloves. Amazing design, tight seal, rugged as can be. Just throw it in the bed and it holds up back there. A bunch of my oilfield customers use these to transport small items too!Mine was in pretty impeccable condition, though it did appear to have been freshly painted and not prepped the greatest before they did, so it shows a bit of what may be dust, rust, or sanding texture. (I got mine from 'Field Gear & Protection') No big deal though, wasn't even expecting the finish to have been all that great on it anyway-- and if you're looking for something like this, I doubt you are either, just worth noting."
4,Maybe they really were painted by a grunt?,Wish I'd had a 5 star rating like almost everyone else but these cases have a little rust & a bad paint job. Maybe that means they really were painted by a grunt?Won't keep me from buying more though. As long as they keep the ammo dry. Wonder if the product quality differs between sellers?
4,Great,"These ammo cans are great condition. They look brand new. Very useful, will definitely buy more. They are great for almost everything"
5,Ammo Box,This was a gift for my husband! It was what he was looking for! Good QUALITY! Just what he wanted!
4,cool,nice product and it works like you would expect it to. works fine and cool product. cool cool cool cool
5,Great,This Ammo Box is awesome the one bad thing was the words on the side looked liked they were sprayed painted over but all in all This is a great collecters item
3,Good Shape but Overpriced,"The ammo box was received quickly and is in good condition. However, shame on me, I looked at the local Army and Navy store and found dozens of similar boxes, most in as good or better shape, for literally 1/3 what I paid for this one. Buyer beware. Not the seller's fault. They offered the product and the price, and I bought it thinking that Amazon prices are usually good or excellent. Opps!"
1,"nice product, check the listing","This would have been a 5 star rating if they would have sent the proper number of ammo cans. The picture clearly shows 3 cans and the price reflects 3 cans, but if you look at the verbiage it states the products are sold individually. I ordered 2 sets of these thinking I would receive a total of six cans. 2 days later two cans show up in the mail. I figured the rest would come the next day. When they did not show up I checked my account and it said all items have been delivered. I contacted the seller and they said it was an issue on Amazon's end. So I contact Amazon and was told it was an issue on the sellers end. I will be returning the items due to this discrepancy because $85 dollars for only 2 cans is WAY too much. The cans themselves were in very good condition, and I do feel the sellers intent was to sell 3 cans. I am only giving 1 star at this time until the pricing issue is resolved."
1,.50 Cal Ammo Can?,"They are not .50 cal ammo cans. They are 30 cal or 5.56 ammo cans. Buyer beware. Too small for my needs as a container for truck emergency can(flairs, tow strap, jumper cables, etc)."
3,For Blenheim buffs only,"I would only recommend this book to those readers who are really, really interested in the battle of Blenheim. All others will probably lose interest in the run-up to the battle, which is in the form of several chapters detailing the fiendishly complicated political intrigues of the day. I did find some bright spots in this book: the correspondence between John Churchill and his wife is fascinating, as are the descriptions of the ghastly medical care of the day and the poor Carlos II of Spain, a freakish product of royal inbreeding. By the time I got to the battle, though, my interest had waned."
3,Average Read,"I was able to finish this book over the course of a weekend and was a bit disappointed with it overall. Several reviewers have already done a great job of summarizing all three stories included, so I'll just give brief opinions on the three:I thought the first story was really strange - similar to any movie you've seen where the character gets stuck in another realm and realizes what life is all about. The second story started out great but I was annoyed by the ending. This might have something to do with the fact that I haven't yet read Carrie Pilby? The third story was the best by far, unrealistic at times, of course, but funny as several parts made me chuckle. I will definitely be checking out more stuff by the third author.I read this book at the beginning of December and it helped to kick off the holiday season. I would recommend purchasing it used or borrowing it from a library, but I don't think I would recommend purchasing it new for yourself or a gift."
1,Do yourself a favor: do not read this book.,"All three of the stories were very stereotypical. You have all three types of stereotypical women in the stories:1. The overly independent type who allows herself to settle down in the end.2. The really smart but socially clueless type who is much overused.3. The rich and sophisticated but from a small, embarrassing town type, who is also much overused.I found this book to be way too typical to be enjoyable. I found the first story the most ridiculous, it sounded like something my younger sister would make up. It was like one of those airplane movies that you want to end but it never does."
4,Not too shabby,"This Joystick, although I am fairly new to it has shown to be a pretty well designed pc attachment. With 4 buttons, it combines the right amount of function and are apropriatly places on the unit. All good joysticks must have the given throttle, and This one definately does not fall short. It's USB port allows access for most universal PC's. Pretty nice peice of equipment for any small time flight sim. enthusiast."
1,Disappointing NON COLOR transfer of this holiday oddity.,"This DVD of Dangerous Christmas is NOT in COLOR as all the listings for it indicate. It is not even a digital transfer. The source material is the old VHS master from the budget VHS tapes of this title that were released for several years. This is a grainy, dirty image that contains numerous film breaks and splices. The bonus inclusion of the original soundtrack that was originally released on ABC Paramount records is a clumsy transfer that contains skips in several of the cuts.This is a DVD to avoid if you have this material in any other format. This DVD is not an upgrade in any way from the old VHS tape or the old LP recording."
2,BEWARE: LAMP BURNS OUT QUICKLY!!,I love everything about this TV - EXCEPT the bulb doesn't last nearly as long as JVC will lead you to believe. We got about 600 hours out of ours vs. the 6000 JVC claims. There are blogs about lamp life and there are people trying to build a class action suit.
2,Great TV - Terrible Lamp life,"The TV picture is great but my lamp blew out in 5 months and about 500 hours of use. The lamp is rated to run for 6000 hours according to JVC.I have also found out online that many people have had the same problem and JVC is failing to acknowledge this problem.I would caution the buyers that this is potential problem for JVC D-ILA sets in general, not just this model."
1,"Extremely costly to fix ""common"" problem","Our HD-52Z575 was only 18 months old when the DMD malfunctioned (resulting in a split picture w/half of image reversed and color bizarre). It would cost $1000 to fix a $2500 TV--no longer under the one year warranty. The tech says this a ""common problem"" w/JVC widescreens, and the JVC customer service rep says these TV's were ""not designed to withstand being moved from the factory to the retail stores--can't take the 'abuse.'"" Buy another brand, and/or buy a very extended warranty. We are throwing a $2500 TV in the trash."
4,Generally Excellent - but Sony was better.,"Excellent television with one exception. Seemingly unresolved compatibility issue with the HDMI cable. I couldn't get a Toshiba DVD to operate on this TV through the HDMI cable, even though it worked on the 61 inch JVC and on other brand television sets such as Sony and Toshiba. The problem was replicated on other 52 inch JVC sets. However an LG DVD with HDMI worked fine on the JVC 52 inch.This is a great performer. Worked very nicely on DVDs and surprisingly well on standard Dish Sattelite channels -- which is important because there are very few HD channels. I ended up returnming my set and getting a Sony 55 inch (the KDF-55WF655). After viewing the Sony for a couple of days, I think the Sony is a better performer. Sony has more clarity, and less digital artifacts. The Sony performed better on DVDs and on Dish digital channels.Bottom line, the JVC is a great TV - the Sony 55"" is better."
4,"Amazing concerts, but where is ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine?","I love these concerts, and to have them all in one package is great. But I found that the only performance missing is that of Celine Dion singing the song of Titanic. I saw it on Youtube and it is amazing.WHY THE HELL DID THEY OMIT THIS SONG?!!!!!! That's one star less in my rating... ."
4,A classic set of unique concerts,This set contains a comprehensive set of the concerts organized by Pavarotti in his home town Modena.The level of musicians and their enthousiasm in working with Pavarotti truly make these concerts memorable.A must for classic and light music lovers.
1,Pitiful,"I feel sorry for Cesar Franck when I hear Dolores O'Riordan sining ""Panis angelicus"".I suggest anybody who loved this performance to listen to anaverage classical singer, male or female, interpreting this samePanis angelicus. Then you probably discover what music is. For this contribution, I give this DVD one star."
3,WHERE'S PAVAROTTI?,THE TITLE SHOULD BE FRIEND'S OF PAVAROTTI BECAUSE HE'S ONLY IN ONE OF THE SELECTIONS! BUYER BEWARE!
4,"Nice set, but not for playing","I love this set, although is not designed to play. Having the pieces so different between them makes difficult to concetrate on the game. But is very nice to show. I bought a very thick glass chess board and set it up over a table in the living room and looks fantastic.The plastic is not very good; Yoda and Griveus tend to bend a lot. But the details are very good."
4,Star Wars Chess Set,"I purchased this set for my seven year old son. We both really enjoy the pieces and they just make playing chess a little more interesitng (for his age). I sometimes get wrapped up in animating the pieces during play that I get distracted...thus he has beaten me half a dozen times. Except for the fact that the pieces don't return easily to the plastic sheet they came it, it is a good looking game. What I am going to do is get two sacks (0ne black, one white-of course) and place the pieces in there."
5,Beautiful CD,"Very soothing and beautiful music! I am a massage therapist and love this CD, so do my clients."
5,Excellent Compilation,"I really enjoy 2002. Daily, I listen to four of their CD's in my car. I love their early compilation, ""The Sacred Wall."" This is also an excellent compilation of their work. I find ""Timeless"" meditative, relaxing and peaceful. It is the best of 2002 since ""The Sacred Wall."""
3,Legends Series: Timeless,The Legends Series: Timeless CD is a good relaxation music CD. The collection of songs is good and was well thought out. I categorize the music as soothing and peaceful. It could be deemed massage music or new age music.
4,A little large,"I've tried medium and they were just too tight. This was just a bit too large. It doesn't hold in as much as I'd like it to. However, I had a nice looking waist while wearing it. Can they make a medium and a 1/2? :)Not incredibly uncomfortable. I wore it to work yesterday. Nine hours may be a little too long to wear for the first time out. It started getting uncomfortable at about hour six. I've never worn a girdle before. I will wear it again. I really liked the way my waist looked."
4,"Works great, but a bit uncomfy","For the price this shaper is unbeatable. It slims the waistline and makes the ""muffin top"" invisible. It is a bit uncomfortable, but most shapers are. I recommend this product."
3,Not for petite women,"I ordered the small, and the corset was too long pinching my breast....but otherwise it was a well made corset.....to keep in the pooch.....I just wish it came in x-small for petite build....."
4,works good,"I am 5'1 with a big belly so I got it in xxl. Fits perfect and doesn't move around or roll down. Doesn't suck in my belly as much as I had hoped, but it does somewhat. Very comfortable though."
1,Returned,I returned this after receiving it and trying it on. It was so noticeable under clothing and the top and bottom constantly were rolling up and it was just a hassle. I would not recommend this.
2,not so good,it did not hug me as i expected it to. so i gave it away. i am golng to try the Ardyss. end result i will not recommend for anyone who wants a noticeable difference. it is better if u exercise and eat healthy. i have been eating what we in Trinidad call grass (salad) for 7 days and lost 3 lbs
2,Bad sizing,I went by the sizing chart provided by the company and it didn't fit at all. Their sizing was at least an entire size too small. I had to return the product.
5,Use Daily!,"I love this shaper! I am actually wearing it right now... I have fairly wide love handles (which is why I use shapers to begin with) and the boning doesn't give too much so it keeps a flattering shape. I wear it with the clasps in the back and just step in and pull it up. I'm 5'4"" and it is a little bit long -- after wearing for extended periods of time the boning digs a little big either in my lower stomach or under my breasts, depending on if its riding a higher or lower at the time. Overall, I absolutley love this and will be ordering more in the near future!"
2,Yet Another Disappointment,"I purchased this at a local store. I am 67"" and approx 165 lbs. My waist is approx 33-35 in. Well, I wanted something to slim my tummy whenever I feel ""puffy"". I have tried soo many other products, and this too will end up at the top of my closet.So, here's the thing: I cannot wear it under a form fitting shirt, all the hooks, rods, etc, show thru. It holds tight to the top and bottom, but that mid (most important) section, bulges right thru. And to add a reason that makes most shapewear suck, is the fact that I am STUCK with it. You cannot (and should not) return under garments. So, for anyone who is undecided, I realize the 5-Star ratings seem promising, but I strongly suggest you try something else. If nothing else, go to a local store because it would REALLY suck if you pay S&H; to have this disappointment DELIVERED!"
2,puckers when you sit,"while this slimmer was not horribly uncomfortable, it puckered when i sat and created a deformed and unflattering form, thereby defeating its whole purpose. it would stick out at the wiring / seaming and was visible through my clothes. needless to say, i returned it."
2,Sizing is way off.,"I ordered the waistnipper in extra large because the other reviewers mentioned that it ran small. I usually wear medium tops with an occasional large depending on the style. This slimmer was so small that it came nowhere near meeting on me (and I do understand it is supposed to be quite snug, given the purpose). Unfortunately, I missed the return window so I'm stuck with it now. I gave it two stars because the workmanship appears to be of high quality. I just can't recommend the product because the sizing was too far off the mark."
2,Eh...,"I bought this to go with my Halloween costume. At first, I thought it was awesome. It sucked it all in, and I felt like I'd like lost 15lbs around my midsection. However, after an hour of wearing it, I was so uncomfortable I wanted to take it off. I had to keep readjusting, and it was painful to sit down in due to the wires pushing into my body. I'll probably never wear it again, and feel like I've wasted my money. :("
4,Easier to get on than most shape wear,"Works pretty well and is not as uncomfortable as many shape wear garments. I washed it in a mesh bag in cold water on delicate,then let it air dry-- it was like new. This line is not as pricey as Spanx. I would definitely recommend it."
3,firm control waistnipper,"The service was great, received in a very timely manner. The only problem I have with it is for me I would have liked more support. It is bad to roll. As long as your standing, it works really well, but when you sit down, it rolls."
3,"works, but...","the waist nipper is great, it works, but i am a very active person with three kids, and as i moved around throughout the day the waist nipper would ride up and get under my bra, leaving my abdomen ( a trouble area ) uncovered. i found my self constantly having to pull it down"
4,a bit too long for me...,"I am 5'2'' and 121 lbs. Measured my waist and ordered Medium according to the size chart.It does what it's supposed to: it shapes my waist smooth and nice. It's not too tight and it does make me feel I'm standing tall, correcting my posture.However, it is a little too long for me. If I pull it up too high, it digs into my bust, and if I pull down a little, it digs into my behind, which creates a line noticeable from outside the clothes... If it was 1 inch shorter, it would have been perfect..."
2,Wendy,"I was not very happy with the product. It rubbed against the small of my back and the rods that are in it, poked and rubbed under my breasts. I will not buy this or any product close to it again. I bought something similar product at the Wal-Mart for $10 less and It doesn't hurt as much but still rubs when you bend.Flexees Women's Instant Slimmer Firm Control Waistnipper #6868"
5,It will squeeze ya!,"5'8"" 200lbs 42dd and the xl fits the way it's supposed to. You have to adjust your undies and bra over it and then you're good to go make sure to pull it up back under the shoulder blades so you don't spill over."
1,Too long,"I ordered this and the Rago cincher. Both were too long and added extra ""curves"" at the bottom when it ended. I didn't look like a better me at all. If you're short (I'm 5'3"") I don't recommend either of these products. I was trying to avoid getting the shorts because that seemed like it was going to be a big pain if I ever needed to go to the bathroom, but I should have probably gotten those instead. Other shorties, stay clear!"
3,I like the material,"I tried many waistrippers before, but this is the best one because of the material it's made out of, which is the only one that doesn't make me feel suffocated. It would be perfect if it wasn't for the two long front wires that hurt a lot when I am sitting in my job or school. If they were two inches shorter it would be great."
2,makes my tummy bump more noticeable,"The material is good but does not work wonders on my tummy. I am petite and just had a baby. Got the smallest size and when I put it on, my baby belly looks more noticeable. Either I got too small of sizes or it's just the way it's supposed to."
3,runs small,"Ordered my size, far from fitting, also did not like all the hooks, seemed like it might be uncomfortable and tedious to put on because there were so many."
3,Ehhhh :-/,"It was ok . . . to say the least this was my first time having to buy anything like this, but unfortunatly after my fourth baby I gained 40 extra lbs that wouldn't drop off as fast as it did with my last kids. I wanted to feel good again and feel attractive. This ( and all shapeware) made me feel worse then before I put any of it on! I felt like it made it worse. It seems to me that all of it is stretchy fabric that you squish into and it doesn't really keep anything in, more just adds an extra layer of yuck! In my case just made me look like I had a firm pregnant belly. So I give up on shapeware, I will just go back to excercise and be patient until the weight falls off again. The reason I went with 3 stars is because I can't say if its no good for someone else, just that it was no good for me!"
5,Great!,"Great price, great delivery time, and great performance. Fits as expected and does the job. I am 11 weeks out from abdominal surgery and still have swelling so I needed a compression garment. I've tried Spanx and the surgical binders. I still love the binders but I developed a rash from wearing them all the time, even with a long tank top underneath. I found this and thought I would give it a try. I love it! I work 12 hours in a hospital and was worried it would get too hot or ride up or poke me. None of that has happened. Feels very comforta!ble and even forgot I had it on. Have just ordered another one"
3,Not good for petite,"I bought this for my postpartum and I ended up having an emergency C-section so I couldn't wear it because it's a long girdle AkA Waistnipper and it would squeeze my surgery so I wear it now after my surgery healed and it's not as tight as it should be and I have a size Small I'm 4'11 and 123 Lbs. when I put it on, the front hooks don't look like the picture you can see my skin in between from the hooks because of the stretch but it doesn't tuck my postpartum belly in. When I put my shirt on It does not look any different as it would with out it. I guess I just gotta start exercising to get back to my regular weight."
1,Comfort of Flexees,Flexees was very uncomfortable especially when sitting. It would ride up and cause pain on my sternum. Would not purchase again.
4,Flexees Women's Instant Slimmer Firm Control Waistnipper,"I haven't worn it yet other than to try it on. It fit well even though I am long-waisted. I wouldn't wear it with anything slinky because it did leave a bit of a muffin below it around my hips, however, this is a typical problem area for me. So far I am rating it pretty high because it does fit and appears to be of good quality. I especially like that it has row of hooks for adjusting for weight gain/loss. BTW, this is by Kent's wife, Kim."
4,Great and effective,"I just had a baby about 7 weeks ago and I needed something to hide the baby fat around my waist. This girdle/waist sincher in nude is pretty with the floral design. It's very effective because it gets rid of any ""rolls"" that hang over my pants. The only reason it only gets a 4 star rating is because it doesn't get rid of the pooch ""bulge"" from my belly and it's pretty noticeable when wearing tight clingy tops. I think that maybe if it was tighter in that area, it would get rid of the problem (I wear a size 8 pant and comfortably fit into medium tops and I wear the small size in this product because Im petite). But other than that, I love it."
1,Stupid,Uh Hello ! Would be nice to see the product actually work! Something tells me ghe super skinny model looks the same with or without it! Duh!
5,Can't Go Wrong!,"This book was truly unbelievable! This one was even better then his first! Mr. Shannon truly captures the game at it's best and worst. If you're familiar with the grim streets of Baltimore with it's high drug addiction rate as well as it's astounding murder rate, this book takes you on a walk down these cold streets. It's like one of those virtual reality rides where it puts you in the midst of the action. If you understand the streets, this book will really hit home. The biggest surprise was the ending. It was totally unexpected!Even if you haven't read ""For The Love Of Fast Money"", make sure you read this book!"
1,"good pan, just hope you don't need the lifetime warranty","good pan, just hope you don't need the lifetime warranty. they do not honor it. the BBB is look into it."
4,Excellent,"I actually bought this for my mother for Christmas, but found myself in the need of a larger skillet or food would have spilled all over. So now I have to get her another one. This thing is huge! I don't know why I ever used smaller pans in the past. Great price as well. It heats up super fast, and very even. I haven't used it much, so I only gave it 4 stars, probably deserves 5!"
5,Best non stick we have ever used,This is the fourth size we have purchased. Anolon is by far the best non stick cookware we have ever used. It is lower priced than Berdes and much better. We also have a Anolon wok which we really like. This is tru no stick with very even heating. If you want a great pan for everyday use this is it.
2,Pass on this if you want a Pan that lasts more than a year and a half!,"I purchased this pan on Feb 18, 2008 after reading all of the positive reviews...dont fall the positives like I did. I have been using the pan for about a year and 7 mo. and it has lost most of its non stick coating allowing the food to stick worse than a metal pan! Not to mention the fact of where that non- stick coating goes...hmmm. I was pretty happy with the pan at the beginning, having good even heat dispersion. But the fact that it has such a limited life span makes it a loser.I must say that I will never be looking at another Anolon product again. After many months of having to work at scrubbing this ""non-stick"" pan, i am on the hunt for another pan."
5,Geat pan - needs a cover.,"Huge...HUGE...pan (channeling The Donald), but it could use a cover. As long as you don't use very high heat settings, it will last for a very long time (mine still hasn't lost its non-stick capabilities). It washes out clean with a sponge. Anolon makes great non-stick pots and pans at a fraction of the price of other brands and it outperforms them all. Why doesn't Anolon sell seperate covers in the standard sizes???"
5,Fantastic!,"When I ordered this, I actually made a mistake. I wanted a 12-inch skillet. So when the product was delivered, I was overwhelmed by the size, as it was much bigger than I was expecting. I'm not a very good cook, so I thought I would never use this professional size pan. But I decided to keep it anyway as the price was good. Let me tell you, I'm so GLAD I did not return it. Recently I made quick pasta sauce with shrimps and pesto in this skillet, and oh my goodness, I was amazed at this pan! The 14-inch skillet not only cooked the sauce well but also it was big enough to mix the whole cooked 1-pound pasta in it easily! I also made a chicken dish, and this big skillet was big enough to saute several large cut chicken breasts all at once. The quality is excellent - heavy and heated evenly. I am extremely happy with this product. Now I'm motivated to cook more than before. One of the best buy I made recently. Highly recommended!"
3,bottom is way toonundersized,"I purchased this pan to use as any ""everday fry pan"". The top is 14"" as stated. The useable portion, the bottom, is only 9 1/2"". I have 10"" frying pans that have the same sized bottom. I really don't understand why a frying pan would have such deep sloped sides unless it is made just for a 12 egg omlette. I cannot even make 3 pancakes or grill cheese sandwiches at once. I guess maybe that I just didn't know what a french skillet was used for."
4,One huge skillet!,"This thing is big and that is what I wanted. I am a widower, live alone and don't cook much so have used it only a few times so far. It heats and cooks evenly on my glass topped Kenmore range. Cleanup is a snap and AMAZON""S price was the best I could find. I just wish I could find a lid and splash screen for it. Anolon products work great."
3,Did she ever find the block?,When I read Sins of the Father I couldn't wait until the next book by Ms. Madlock came out. I was truly disappointed. This book started out good but it started putting me to sleep. The only reason I finished the book was because I had spent my hard earned money on it. I wished I had purchased another book instead.
2,Try Again,"I finished ""Back on the Block"" and it was an okay read. I gave it two stars simply because I was able to complete it.I enjoyed Felicia's ""Sins of My Father"" far better."
1,WHAT THE HELL!?!@,"What the hell was this, this book was trash! Ms. Madlock you have to do better! This was one of the worst books I read this year! The back cover didn't describe what was in the book, it mentioned characters that were never introduced in the book! This book should have been draft one, go back to the drawing board with this one! I wanted to give this book zero stars, but that wasn't an option!"
1,Okay....,"This book wasn't THAT bad. Granted that the back cover synopsis did not match what was contained in the story AT ALL, I was able to get through the book. There are a multitude of wonderful urban books out there that truly surpass this book. This book was o-kay. I wouldn't run out to read it or buy it at all.The author just needs to step her game up and pay attention to the competition out there that's in the urban book world. This was my first book by this author, she didn't make me a fan at all. But I wouldn't run away from reading anymore of her books. I would just be sure to get them from the library only."
1,Come Harder This Won't Be Easy!!!,"I swear I am abou to STOP spending my money on any old books!! I have read like 3 terrible books in a row!!!I really enjoyed ""Sins Of The Father"" and have looked forward to this book ""Back On The Block"", but I wish I had ordered something else instead.This book was all over the place and the storyline does not match the description on the back of the book. I gave up after like 6 or 7 chapters....AWFUL!!!!"
4,Useful!,"Great for wood floors if your main purpose is dust. It's true that Robo Maid can't handle more than mere dust, but I didn't realize how much dust accumulates in less than a week. If you like ""spotless"" Robo Maid is Very useful."
4,too bad it doesn't mop!,"When my friend bought this little guy for me as a gift, I had to laugh, and was certainly skeptical. I have a large area of wood flooring, and two dogs, so dust and dog hair are a constant battle. The robomaid saves me from doing the floors daily, though doesn't replace a regular mop job or thorough cleaning. Considering that I don't mop or thoroughly clean nearly often enough, this guy has definitely made for a cleaner house. It has far exceeded my expectations, particularly for the price. Additionally, we've found a source for the replacement pads on ebay priced relatively reasonably, and also have found them on robomaid.com."
2,"Wow, this is really good!","And I support PETA. In all seriousness, this is just a bunch of structurally imcompetent metalcore tripe. If you like Killswitch Engage and Demon Hunter, you'll love this compilation. If you know what good music is, you won't. That simple.I gave this two stars because of one good song: ""The Final"" by Dir En Grey, which happens to be one of Diru's softest songs. (On ""Taste of Chaos?..."")- Thus says the Pellington (And remember, just say ""NO"" to metalcore!)"
5,does anyone know???,"i saw cd at target like last week and i was like wtf i didnt know they released another taste of chaos cd and i saw that it had like 30 tracks. i just didnt know if the tracks were live or not? if anyone knows, please tell me cause if they are live ill prob buy it."
2,Hampton Forge San Remo 20 Piece Flatware set with Black Handles,"I was very disappointed with the quality of the silverware. After seeing this in a dining setting the set from Amazon did not appear to be of the same quality, and the trim was very dull."
5,AS Great set of flatware,I am very pleased with not only the style but also the weight ad quality. The pieces just feel great in your hand. I Have not put them in the dishwasher because I do not feel that the resin handles will hold up
5,Flatware,This flatware set is top quality and well balanced. It makes an elegant statement on your table. Dishwasher friendly too! I have received many compliments during parties I've hosted - it's just not your 'every day' flatware.
5,Great value on everyday flatware with a touch of class,Nice everyday flatware with a touch of class. The silver detailing is complementary to the black handles. The flatware has not turned color anywhere or has had parts come loose since its purchase approximately seven months ago. This was a satisfactory purchase and a great value.
2,"OK, but they don't last","They are cheap looking, and quite light in weight. As well, the plastic handles can separate from the metal tangs. This is due to the two piece construction that is not watertight: the water gradually leaks into the handle and softens the epoxy that holds the flatware's tang, causing a wobble over time. FYI: This set is less than a year old, and is washed by hand in a household of two adults."
3,So So,"Kinda cheap looking, longer than normal, doesn't fit in my silverware holder....decent size handles to hold onto is the best plus;)"
5,Delightful,"These videos are amazing. Ode to my family and let it linger are some of the most touching videos I've ever seen. Watching this dvd reminds me of how videos and music is today! Ahh, bring the cranberries back!"
5,Great collection !,"A great mix of Live performances & original clips. Now I can watch their best songs anytime I want. Nice picture on 4:3 format. The Dolby digital 2.0 sounds good in my headphones...A very surprising Live concert in Ireland, when Dolores was pregnant !!!Few weeks ago, I got the ""Live in Paris 2"" DVD and despite the fact that 4 videoclips are on the 2 DVDs, you must have both if you're a fan."
5,"uncomfortable, but amazing!","A look at deploying soldiers through the eyes of a tattoo parlor?This fresh yet intimate documentary is a must-see. Edgy, uncomfortable and completely mesmerizing.I work in film and television and know I'm seeing something good when I forget about lighting, editing, pacing, writing, camera angles - and just give myself up to the story.Regardless of your perspective on any war the US is involved with, please watch this and get to know our soldiers. Whether or not I could relate to the personal circumstances that brought them into the service (or the tattoo parlor), I was riveted by their stories. I came away in awe of their sacrifices and in most cases, their ability to find something positive even in the absolute worst experiences.This film should be mandatory viewing for everyone on Capitol Hill.In fact, it should be mandatory viewing for everyone.Tattooed Under Fire"
5,Maravilloso,This is a fabulous film. It has some humor but is mostly a serious film. It's a great film to use with students to learn something about Puerto Rico. The only problem is that it's pretty long so you certainly cannot see it all in class. There is very little that is not appropriate for classroom use. Mostly I believe profanity is the issue. Also good film for recent history of Puerto Rico. Subtitles seem to be accurate.
1,Unbreakable lens is broken,"I recently purchased a twintask 3AAA to use at work and just noticed that the lens is busted...how can this be from a supposedly ""unbreakable lens"" Also the xenon light is a joke and can only be used with the laser. the LED mode is okay but the pushbutton setup is annoying as you must push it three times to cycle through the different modes. I was looking for a good quality and bright light as i work as an electrician in a industrial setting. this light does not fit the bill!!"
5,good quality expected from streamlight,"I didn't read the description closely and did not realize this had a laser. My husband asked for this for Christmas. He was surprised in a good way by the laser, I guess it was an upgrade. He says: good led output, halogen bulb gives increased lumens. He knows a lot about equipment and gear, and is a police officer and would use this on the job."
2,a List view on lighting,"I admire Ross Lowell's inventions enormously. His lights, while not as robust as others and so not so well suited to rental houses, are a great tool for the beginning owner-operator. I began with his Lowel Lights and moved up to his D-heads. I remember them all fondly, even though I no longer use them.After many years as a director of photography, I've begun to teach lighting and have been looking at book options for my students. So far the best book I've found on this topic is Blain Brown's ""Motion Picture and Video Lighting"". While the layout of Lowell's book is stunning, as are many of the images, Lowell approaches each section with long lists which to my mind do nothing to inspire the thinking eye. With great respect for Lowell, I regretfully report that for me his book is for the encyclopediast, not for the emerging eye."
5,Simply Awesome,"This is an art book, not just some book on specs, and lighting selection. It's simple, yet to the point... Perfect book if you want to shoot your own movie, and need to learn the basics (and there's also many advanced topics) to start shooting with decent lighting. The author is very down to earth, and offers great advice. The illustrations and format of the book are amazing. Just buy it!"
5,Get it!,Jack Dykinga together with David Muench is today's top shot of large-format-colour photograpers out in the landscape. It's quite a fortune that he shares his best advice and some of his wonderful pictures with us in that book. This is not dry physics about tilt and shift. This is pure practice and it explains why many serious landscape photographers switch to large format and it makes you want to go out into the wilds and capture your own picture in 4x5.
3,Not what I had hoped for - but OK,This book is light on technical information unless you happen to use the exact same equipment as the author. This is primarily a personal journal and not really an instructional volume. Pictures are OK.
2,Far from Instructional,"If you're looking for an instruction book on LF Photography, then this is NOT the book.Jack Dykinga's highly acclaimed talent as a photographer does not translate into this book. As other reviewers have commented, the book falls far short on technical merit."
2,"Lots of fluff, little good stuff.","Having read a few books on LF photog, I was expecting more of the same in quality of instruction and information, and was sorely disappointed. I don't understand why some photographers writing LF books feel they need to discuss very basic photo framing techniques and beginner concepts, other than to fill enough pages to make a book. Way too much unnecessary info (like botanical names of every plant, or the fully qualified name of every lens and every piece of gear for every photo for every demo in the book) made for painful reading. And where more info was needed, none was there. Statements like ""I used back tilt"", without any indication of which direction, or approximations as to the degree of tilt provides little usable data. If you want to wade through all this useless data, and lots of personal comments on the beauty of his subjects to glean a few morsels of actual operational instruction, then this book is for you."
1,Large Format Nature Photography,This book is poorly written and edited. The reader is short-changed by the lack of information presented in the book. Some of Dykinga's better known images are published in the book but without any descriptive information of trials and tribulations encountered in the making of the images. Those descriptions would have made the book more interesting and helped to balance the paltry technical information.
2,Lesbian story hijacked by added Gay plot,"If you think marriage is the end-all-be-all, this brief adventure in amateur filmmaking does not provide enough reasons to explain its obsession with it. Being together as a couple for a long time and formally proving one's commitment to the other is the only argument given for wanting a contractual legal bonding. Any other pros, and absolutely no cons, of matrimony are considered. The story of a lesbian relationship, however, is soon hijacked by the coming-out saga of a teenage male and his relationship with his stepfather and visiting Gay biological father. For whatever reason, making a 50 minute movie about two Asian lesbians, their families and mixed cultures (one is Chinese, the other Japanese) was not good enough for the filmmaker."
3,Fairly funny,"Floored by LoveBoth ladies very attractive subtle humour from the mothers involved, story seemed rushed towards the end of the film and definatly not enough loving!"
1,BECAUSE I COULDN'T GIVE ZERO STARS,"This is just a feel good book for the people who do not pursue any worthwhile intellectual pursuits. Arguments are weak, and to even suggest that reality shows show a rise in culture is ludicrous, in my opinion. Those who watch reality shows basically are sitting around, watching strangers on television, and in the process not doing anything with their own lives.My theory and my opinion is that this author may know his arguments are invalid, but he knows that so many people want justification for their inactive lifestyles that they will buy this book.Save your money on this one and read any fine piece of literature..or if not that, then go outside and do something...do not let your life be controlled by screens (tv, computer, cell phone, etc...)"
2,A Rant,"Stephen Johnson is a master of language, no doubt about that. But the book is monotonous, it blatantly rejects all of the well established norms and practices. It becomes almost impossible to read towards the end, when even Johnson says he is arguing for the sake of arguing. Yes, Johnson expresses his unique point of view and has mastered the art of arguing and rhetoric, he simply does not say anything useful or important."
4,Everything Bad is Good for You,"This text made several valid points regarding recent research on the effects of formerly-labeled unproductive behaviors, such as television viewing for children. The book is an easy read and would make a decent book club read."
4,something for parents to think about,"Every parent should wonder what is best for their child. There are no easy answers. This book gives some good arguements to allowing your children to have a wide range of experiences, yes, including video games and television.Children are smart and learn fast. I have an advanced engineering degree, but my 5 and 9 year old can figure out the rules of video games faster than I can. They have great problem solving abilities, and yes they also like to read. Books are very important in our house.Saying popular culture is all bad is close minded. Read with your childen, but also don't be afraid to play video games and watch challenging television with them as well.The book is a little dry, but worth the effort."
4,good book but lay off the fps!,"Its a good book with many good points. my one gripe is how he characterizes first person shooters as brainless twitch games. thats a bit like saying tetris is a brainless twitch game. both require quick thinking as well as quick reflexes. both punish the gamer if they are lacking in either department. the best fps gamer play with others in online servers and they will out think you as well as out maneuver you. this is especially true in team based first person shooter games like counterstrike, the team that doesn't work together or has no strategy is easy to beat. my guess is the author just played by himself in single player which is a bit brainless."
4,Robert Kalinowski's Review of Steven Johnson's Everything Bad Is Good for You,"Length:: 7:31 MinsRobert Kalinowski's review was made as part of a critical review assignment for the Spring 2009 Economics of Technology seminar at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, taught by Art Diamond. (The course syllabus stated that part of the critical review assignment consisted of the making of a video recording of the review, and the posting of the review to Amazon.)"
4,It is an interesting read,"As a media psychologist, I'm intrigued with Steven Johnson's suppositions of the positive influence and increased cognitive demands of our current media (television, electronic games, and the Internet). It is an interesting read."
3,Bad is better but still bad,"It is an interesting argument and easy to see why it could be popular--it gives us an excuse to indulge in things we know are not really good for us. He make a convincing case that our most mindless activities have become more complex and cognitively engaging, but forgets this is time not spent on other kinds of fun, relaxing and enjoyable activities.A video game can have a small positive influence on a child but not in the complex and multifaceted way that playing a social sport like baseball or basketball can. Watching 'reality TV' can train people about social behavior but not in the far more meaningful way that merely having a conversation with a real person can. Listening to pop music cannot engage a person the same way as singing or playing an instrument. The list goes on and on.The lowest common denominator may, as Johnson argues, be higher--but that really should not be what we aspire to."
3,Mainly Preaching to the Choir,"A fan of Neil Postman's critiques of pop culture, I was hoping for Johnson to make a more convincing case that video games and television are building critical thinking skills. The chapters on television will try the patience of anybody who has already dismissed that medium as a frivolous time waster. Johnson builds his argument through lengthy references to current prime time shows, the plots of which he asserts would stupefy earlier generations of viewers. So what? Maybe the content is more sophisticated now, but it's still TV. His discussion of video gaming's connection to critical thinking is a bit more convincing, but not by much. At least he never suggests that people should stop reading. After all, that's the medium he chose to reach his audience."
2,VERY Redundant,"While the book is full of solid arguments on why ""the bad"" is really good for you, it gets very redundant at times. It almost seems as if the author is trying to spread his argument over as many pages as possible in order to meet a quota."
3,took forever to get,Usually with routine shipping it only takes a few days but this took a LOOOONG time.
3,XBOX 360 is also good for you.,"Johnson's arguments are compelling at times and presented in a way that someone who rarely reads could follow. The idea that the more computer games you play the better you will be at problem solving has some merit, but the book falls far short of giving overwhelming evidence it is good for you.Some of the arguments are like some diets, it is hard to believe that you are actually going to lose weight by eating eggs and bacon all day. There is no doubt that playing computer games will enhance some skills, but not to the extent that Johnson is proposing. Overall it is an interesting read."
2,Doesn't back ideas up with evidence,"You may agree or disagree with the argument presented by the author, it doesn't matter. I for one disagreed.The main reason I disliked this book is not his thesis, it's the fact that he does not back up his points. For example, a quarter of the book is about why TV is actually good for you, but when he moves onto his discussion of the internet, his first arguments are that at least it's ""better to have minds actively composing the soap opera of their own lives than zoning out in front of someone else's."" (comparing blogging to tv) He contradicts his own argument at multiple points.The problem is that the author seems to have started with a controversial idea, then grabbed for examples to back it up, rather than coming to a conclusion based upon the evidence. As other reviews stated, the examples are carefully chosen...Not to mention the fact that he has no real scientific evidence presented in the book..."
2,"Define ""good""","The author made a pretty good case that some pop culture is not bad, but he does not make a strong argument it is good. I didn't read the notes section but I felt that there was a lack of supporting data in the main text for many of his statements and arguments (though he mentions a few times that ""studies should be done""). He dismisses counter arguments with a few sentences: Yes, test scores in academic subjects are down, but problem solving ability is up! Yes, the content may be violent, but problem solving ability is up! I wonder just how this problem solving ability is being applied to non-entertainment situations, if at all. Does it translate into anything that leads to ""good""? The book is really about video games - the other topics, TV, movies, etc. seem like padding."
3,"""Everything Bad..."" is mostly good.","Pop culture has found its champion in Steven Johnson. Johnson appears to be a man obsessed with easing his own guilt in being entertained and mesmerized by the manifestations of today's pop culture (e.g., video games and reality tv). His arguments at times are straightforward and at others quite complex. However, all points are well thought out and, unfortunately, often pain-stakingly discussed. In fact, ""beating a dead horse"" comes to mind when I think of some of the more drawn out arguments. My brain reverberates with the sounds of my conscious screaming, ""I get it already.""However, for those, like myself, who find themselves perversely attracted to the violence of Grand Theft Auto or Half Life and voyeuristically satisfied by reality TV, this book will arm you with weapons for your own defense against linear-thinking traditionalists. If you can make it through what amounts to a 200-page undergraduate research paper, albeit one that got an 'A'."
3,NOT QUITE,"Johnson is spot on about computer and video games and how they are fundamentally changing the way an entire generation thinks, learns, works, shares, etc. and raising IQ scores and cognitive abilities in the bargain. But he should have left well enough alone by sticking with exploring the gaming phenomenon. Instead, he throws gaming in the same grab bag as other ""entertainment,"" notably television. Once he wrote about The Sopranos and inane shows like Survivor and The Apprentice in the same sentence, he lost me. ""Reality television provides the ultimate testimony to the cultural dominance of games in this moment of pop culture history..."" Give me a break. This is yet another example of a potentially great full-length magazine article that never should have been turned into a book. A well-edited 5,000 words max would have covered it all."
5,Austin's greatest explodes on the scene with Boom Boom Baby,"The uglies are in finest form with their newest Capricorn release. These guys are the absolute quintessential Austin rock/funk/blues/power lounge band and Boom Boom Baby captures Bob, Bruce and team at the top of their game. Perhaps Austin's best live band, The Ugly Americans sport a rich lineage ranging from Poi Dog Pondering to Joe Rockhead. That said, if you don't live in Austin and can't get to Antone's on Tuesday nights to catch the uglies or their alter ego The Scabs live, Boom Boom Baby is the next best thing."
5,"Love, love, love the UA!","I have been a Bob Schneider fan for years! Love the Ugly Americans, Joe Rockhead, the Scabs and every other BS invention that has graced a stage. You can beat Boom Boom Baby as it's not just a guy singing, a guitar and bass player and a drummer. The various instruments used along with different genres make this former band a continuous classic. I will never get tired of listening to this album and seeing what Bob comes up with next!"
2,Clean It Up,"While the musical talent of this band is evident, from the first note, the lyric writing has something to strive for. While not every line has a 4 letter word in it, the Ugly Americans (aka Scabs) make up for it by degrading women, talking about rape (how it is okay) and the like. If you have a mixer that can eliminate the voice track, buy this album, otherwise it would be wise to avoid it."
2,Uh um..,"Well this is stupid. They double the amount of money for twister and just add ""glam"". But twister is awesome. Just a rip off of the original. ;-)"
2,Buyer beware!!,"If you're looking for George R.R. Martin's ""The Hedge Knight"" story, DO NOT buy the paperback version of this book. As one other reviewer noted, the paperback only includes 4 out of the 11 stories. Very disappointing."
4,More from the best,"^Legends^ presents original stories from the best writers of fantasy literature. George R.R. Martin's ""A Hedge Knight"" is a must read for anyone who enjoys his ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series (which should be everyone). Orson Scott Card's ""A Grinning Man"" is a gem that surely will put a smile on your face. It should be a law: Writers this gifted need to publish a new novella every year."
4,GRRM. What else?,"4 of 5 stars because I really don't care for the stories outside of aSoIaF by GRRM. If you're a fan of him and his work, and you've read all 5 volumes thus far of aSoIaF, then you're itching for more. So naturally, you're going to want to read the Dunk & Egg stories which would be the prequel. Duncan the Tall is a hedge night and Egg becomes his squire. I'm delighted with these stories and for that alone, I give 4 stars."
3,Legends,I didnt read all of the books it was for my son he read them.what more do you want me to say .
4,Some great authors,Wonderful stories to fill in on most of my fave authors and introduce me to some great new ones.
1,Buy a Starbucks Instead!!!!,"This article (barely long enough to even fall into that category) has LESS CONTENT than other articles you can find for FREE if you search on ""HUMOR IN THE WORKPLACE"" in your search engine! I feel like I've just been robbed! BTW - Amazon forces you to give at least one star - but this is really a ZERO!!!!!"
1,Confusing!,"We found this game to be very confusing as to where the ""vacuum"" robot goes & which direction he's in on each turn. But I have to say that my son has REALLY enjoyed playing with the characters & robot SEPARATE from the board. They're bathtub safe & he's been able to enjoy them there. He also likes to use them on the board, but he makes up his own rules -- so, of course, he always wins!Bottom line, not worth the $$ unless you need tub toys or have a very imaginative child who likes to ""think out of the box""."
4,Inexpensive Repair,"The video card on our Dell went bad. Was able to buy a replacement from these guys for a very small amount. Opened the case, popped the old one out, installed the new one. Up in running in a matter of minutes. Product was exactly as described, like new. Very happy with purchase. Quick shipment."
1,Blue Screen of Death on Windows 7,"I got a new computer at the office and put the video card into the new computer so that I could have a dual-monitor setup. It worked perfectly on my old XP box, but it has a lot of problems on my Windows 7 machine. Tried updates, tried ""hacking"" the drivers, used different versions of catalyst, and nothing helped. If I'm using both monitors with an extended desktop, after a certain period of time, I get a blue screen and the ""atikmdag.sys"" error; then, computer reboots. Sometimes it happens a dozen times in a day, while other times it freezes only once or twice. I'm currently shopping around for a similar, cheap video card that'll be compatible with Windows 7."
4,Good video card replacement for the money,Bought this card as a replacement for mine in a Dell Optiplex SFF GX620 and it works perfectly!Pros: Fits perfectly in the sff case (small form factor)PriceCons: Only comes with DVI-I and S-Video outputs **but this is a direct replacement so I already had the cable (DVI-D)
1,Different card than pictured,"Card is not what is pictured. Received the card shipped in an envelope, no box. Card pictured is a full height card for a regular PC. Product shipped is low profile card that will not fit in a regular PC."
5,My New Best Friend,I am a seven year old boy and I really like this robot. He is great. He is my best friend. I love when he sings and dances to music. I really think that everyone in this whole entire world should buy one!
2,Flimsy,Nice size but the stuffing was not secure. My niece was not impressed with the face details either.
5,"the next move of God ,F. Pickett","I have been trying to get some one from amazon.com to send these books to my home. there was a mix up at ups and they only gave the person that went to pock them up one box for some reason they thought they only had one box . when I got back home from out ot town. I found that there was only part of and order pick up. plese can some on assist me in this situation! We did not get the ten books that we bought, they where sent back!"
5,getting to know the characters,"I couldn't put the book down, I was really drawn to the characters and didn't want the story to end. I laughed a little and cried a little. Loved it."
5,Thanku,I am very happy to write my review about your magazinesit has a lot of subject and more fun it's my pluture toexeplore new life in your magazines thanks.
5,Hero On Three Continents,"This is a great novel, readable, moving, informative and certainly it is a major work. It demonstrates the author's great attention to historical accuracy. The mixing of historical facts and personalities with fiction makes for one of the best books I've read in years. This would make a great movie. I cannot wait for the author's next book!"
3,"Simple, but worthwhile","This is one of those typical fast-reading business books that crams a little bit of information in more than the minimally necessary pages, but bulks itself up by using large fonts, one sentence paragraphs, and lots of sermon illustrations. Not a criticsm as much as a description. The general message of this book is that your employees (and you) can be motivated by objectively scoring performance in a manner that motivates rather than discourages. Think of scoring in sports: in basketball, both teams are encouraged to keep playing by the incentive to drive up a positive score, and even though there are some negative measures (like fouls) the players remain focused on adding to the most important number - the score that determines the winning team. This book's purpose is to motivate the reader to use this ""positive feedback"" philosophy to guide and direct employees. This is light but useful reading that could be covered entirely on a long airplane ride."
2,Didn't work for me,"I purchased this hoping it would help with mood swings and give me more energy. When I take it, though, it doesn't seem to work. In fact, it makes me feel sluggish and tired, which totally doesn't make sense to me. I may try using it again, but right now I am not pleased with it."
3,Deceptive Plot,"This is typical Nora Roberts. Great, quirky characters. A good, light read even if a bit predictable. Those who like the romantic fiction format will like this one as well."
2,cute,"Simple and cute. Predictable but enjoyable, had a couple of plot surprises. Obviously written for the Harlequin brand of books."
4,Always a quick read,This is a stand alone book which keeps with the Nora Roberts standard of great reading. Cute and almost fantastical but not quite.
4,always a good one,You can never go wrong with Nora Roberts. All her books are great. I have never read one I didn't like.
3,No de mis favoritos,Definitivamente hay otras novelas de NR que me han gustado más. Buen servicio y el libro en muy buenas condiciones.
3,a bit deceptive,"I enjoyed the book, it had a pace and story. It was a bit dated, or maybe it's just that I have become dated."
2,The Art of Deception,This is not one of Nora Roberts better books. The plot and the characters were not all that interesting. I've read worse is why I gave it 2 stars.
3,The Art of Deception,I liked the book ok. It didn't seem to quite the same depth of other books I've read by her.
3,2 episodes already on Volume 1,"If I had remembered what episodes were on Volume one, I would NOT have ordered this. Two of the same episodes are on volume one and they had the nerve to put them on volume two??? WTF? The kids don't care but my older one is just like me and wonders why they put the same episodes on this volume. waste of money."
1,This is not funny,The gameboy video is a good idea but only four episodes? why majesco why i can buy a DVD and of spongebob cost 15 bucks and have nine episodes.
1,WHY WASENT THERE A SAGWA GBA VIDEO?,"I HATE THIS SHOW. SPONGEBOB IS ONE OF THE WEIRDEST CARTOONS I KNOW. I ALWAYS REALIESED HOW WORST NICKELODEON GOT. ONE TIME I WAS WANTING YOU CANT DO THAT ON TELEVISION TO BE ON. INSTEDT THERE WAS SOME DISAPOINTING SHOW CALLED DANNY PHANTOM. IF YOU WANT GOOD TV YOU WONT FIND IT HERE. BECAUSE OF DANNY PHANTOM BEING ON AT THE SAME TIME THE GREAT OLD SCHOOL U-PICKS WERE OFF-THE-AIR FOR GOOD. THIS LOOKED LIKE A GOOD IDEA BUT I PROBABLY SHOULDNT BUY THIS SINCE THIS DOESENT HAVE ANYTHING THAT I REALLY LIKE INCLUDEING REN & STIMPY, 3 STOOGES, CAILLOU, SAGWA, COUNT DUCKULA, OR YOU CANT DO THAT ON TELEVISION EVEN."
5,safari green dragon,"There is a whole collection of dragons and everyone of them is unique on its own. These are durable and hold up. Any kid would love this, boy or girl."
1,garlic uncle bens rice,I usually love garlic but this was too much. I love Uncle Bens regular Wild Rice and would continue to buy it but not the garlic.
3,Barry Farm,The Barley Flakes were fine. The product was sent very delayed. I am having better luck ordering from Eden Farms.
4,good documentary,"if you ever wondered why we couldn't prevail in vietnam, you should watch this. it places blame where it should be placed."
5,No Subsitute for Victory,"I must confess, I have not seen this DVD start to finish, but it is a fantastic film for all Duke Wayne fans. John Wayne talks about the war in Vietnam and why American's should support it. John Wayne was proud supporter of World War II and Vietnam. It is interesting to note his political side, which can be guessed by watching many of his films, if you want more further depth on the Duke's politics, then I suggest you read, ""My Life With The Duke"" by Pillar Wayne and ""John Wayne: My Father"" by Aissa Wayne, fantastic in-sites."
4,great job,This was a great cd. Just wish there were more songs to listen to. I pray they have some more out pretty soon.
5,Good Riddim,"This is one of the wickedest Riddims to come out of JA for the culture scene in a while. Of course the risins superstar ""I-Wayne"" Kills the track. You also have some good songs by Richie Spice, Chuck Fender and Anthony Cruz. I advise everyone to cop this one"
4,great optics but bad eye cups,"I use them for bird watching and hunting a few times a week and think they are pretty good. The optics are great and I have no complaines about anything but the eye cups. They are a pain to adjust. I leave mine in one position and they are fine, but if you like to fiddle with them and move them up and down, get a different pair. I also have Zeiss Conquest and Nikon Monarch and would put the Predator C5 right between the two. Better than the Monarchs, but not quite as good as the Conquest."
5,NICE CHILDREN'S BOOK,"A CLASSIC TALE OF RAGGEDY ANN AND OF COURSE THE NICE POLICE OFFICER. ONE OF THE VERY FIRST BOOKS THAT I HAD PURCHASED FOR MY DAUGHTER, IT WAS A GREAT ADDITION TO HER COLLECTION."
4,Ghost Canoe,"The book I read was Ghost Canoe written by Will Hobbs. This book is great for anyone who wants a great mystery,action packed book. Or anyone who just simply wants to kill some time. This is honestly one of the best books I have ever read. I would surely recommend this book to any one. This book takes place on a small island just off of Canada. And it starts out with a boy Nathan MacAllister who is the son of a light house keeper. Any way a ship crashes on the rocks not to far away from where Nathan lives. The local authorites say there are no survivors. But things don't add up. To make things even stranger there is a set of foot prints in the sand off shore. Reading that short description how can you not want to read this book I mean come on. Plus it's a easy book to read. I would say it's at about a six grade level with normal modern voice that speaks to you."
5,Kashmir simply rock my world!,"This cd is truly a master piece! I could recommend it to anyone who enjoys Limp Bizkit, Korn or alike..... It conatins heavy, funk, and a spice of punk....... Best track on it is ""king prawn blues"" Quick order NOW!"
4,hath the lion prevailed,"""Hath The Lion Prevailed"" is an interesting book to read about the heart of one ""SOUL."" It puts one in touch with an understanding of one self, and through ""Rastalogy."" It is a primier that give one a true understanding of Rasta. Using the bible you can see where the author proves why Haile Selassie is Jesus returned in his Kingly and conquering form. I think that ""Hath The Lion Prevailed"" is an execellent book and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about Rastafarian truth."
4,One of Horenstein's best,"This is one of Horenstein's best Mahler recordings. The interpretation, orchestral playing, and recording quality form a musical unity that is memorable and musically convincing as well. But due to Horenstein's subjective choices, the interpretation is not, in my view, as consistent as Kubelik's (DG or Audite), Walter's (SONY) or Barbirolli's (Dutton), which I consider to be the first choices. For example, the broad tempo choice at the very end is hardly what Mahler indicates in the score.Buyers should beware of amazon second hand conmen that try to sell this disc for absurd prices. It is better to visit amazon.co.uk and buy this disc for less than $15, brand new."
5,Definitive.,"A very few recordings of symphonic repertoire are definitive. Any others will be inferior overall, even if they have their positive aspects. Carlos Kleiber's rendition of Beethoven's fifth symphony is one such example. Fritz Reiner's 1954 performance of Strauss' ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" is another. And this recording of Mahler's first symphony is another. Yes, many other versions exist. Some of them are very good. But for the sweeping totality of interpretation, for the sheer power in the orchestral playing brought forth, and for the depth of understanding of every nuance of the score, Horenstein stands alone. This is the only performance you will ever need. Save your money and buy this."
4,"Wonderful, but why aren't the movies in the original order?","The customer reviewers who rated this product highly based on its contents are right; those who gave it a poor rating based on the fact that Amazon listed it before being able to provide complete information on it may well have had a point to raise with Amazon, but hardly a reason to give the product itself a bad rating. What would have raised my own rating from four to five stars would have been to present the movies IN THEIR CORRECT CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER instead of the pretty much random order they appear in here. Would it really have been that much more troublesome or expensive to do that?"
4,bu bu bub bayaaad,"The Thorogood cover had me fooled. I confess my source was a pirated file. Ask a Thorogood fan to listen to it, while making up a story that it's a bootleg of GT playing on X and acting funnier than usual in a Delaware joint, and see if they ask for a copy. Tell them that would be illegal and see if they'll squabble over it."
1,Don't buy this!,"This collection is terrible. These songs were not done by the original artist. Instead this rogue group known as The Countdown Singers are responsible for the performances on this disc. It's a shame that they don't have enough integrity to make their name more easily detected. Of course, if we saw an 80s cd by the countdown singers in big bold letters nobody would probably want to buy it. Stay away! If you come across a similar cd at a store just make sure you read the fine print and be suspicious of the low price."
3,Pretty Good,"I thought this was a good tribute to the original singers. The song, ""Heaven"" sounds just like the original that it's kinda scary.Anyway, this is not a mix of 80s songs, this is a collection of 80s songs sung by a group called, The Countdown Singers."
1,Awsome Blunder,"This is not what you are thinking. If you like 80's music like me, don't be fooled. When I started to play the cd, I noticed the music didn't sound right. Once I heard the sining part, I thought someone pulled a fast one on me. Then I reexamined my order and saw I could only blame myself.This should be more clear about who is singing. The Countdown Singers are a group. I would have neve suspected it wasn't the original artist. There was a 80's collection called Awsome 80's. I had remembered it from the 90's. The Countdown Singers have just got their last bit of money from me. You can bet I will avoid their work from now on. If you think I'm being too harsh, just listen to them. The only thing I'll be diong with these cd's is using them for dog chew toys."
5,"This is an excellent live concert of the fifties pop.vol. one of two,originally shown on pbs.","This is an excellent live concert,volume one of two,originally aired on pbs...This concert contains 24 plus hits,and many musical clips of your favorite stars from the fifties era...It was very important,to get these great artists,on stage to help keep the music alive...Many of the artists are slowly passing in time...It is very important for people from future generations,be,able to hear this wonderful music...From any generation,whatever music you like today may sound weird or dated to future generations....Everything played today will be tomorows oldies...I love and own both albums from pbs..This set makes an excellent gift. 5 star rated...I thank you stewart L."
1,Really Bad DVD,"Poor quality DVD. Wait until you see the McGuire sisters. Big time ""duck lips"" from too many face lifts. Do yourself a favor and skip this DVD."
2,Magic Moments,It was OK but not the quality or content I had expected. I think there may be better films of the 50's out there or at least I hope so as it was a very fun time.
5,"great item, great price",I bought these food saver bags to replace my food saver bags i had used up. I love these bags that u can cut to any size. they are great for freezing meats and vegtables
4,Good.,"Like others said, no box. Feels very unprofessional of FoodSaver.$.057 an inch, not too expensive.I love these things though.I have tripled my freezer space, freezing duration, and time use.It's nice being able to make large batches of stuff like ravioli and TAMALES!!!! on the weekend and keep them. Making hugely complex meals is a pita.Almost forgot sous vide. Google it."
1,WASTE OF HARD EARNED $!,"Definitely a waste of money because they are not reliable. A product that cannot be relied on to function and perform as advertised is not worth the Chinese junk it is made of. Works pretty well for the first few months then the trouble begins. Even after double sealing both ends you will find that the air has leaked in and you food is freezer burned. Plus the bags and jars are EXPENSIVE! My Mom used to stick a straw into a ziplock bag and suck out the air. That works MUCH better than these pieces of junk do. Their vacuum jars are the same way. They cannot be relied on- so DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON FOODSAVER PRODUCTS! Think about it. $28.00 bucks for 18 ft, That's like 18 bags at best but you will find that when you figure in the extra needed for the seal its about a dozen bags! FOR 28 BUCKS?! AND they don't work well at all! Save your $!"
5,Foodsaver bag multi-pack-great buy!,"This is my second order of the Foodsaver multi-roll (3) set of bags (11""x18')--as before, the item received is the ""real"" Foodsaver product (not a knockoff). I love the rolls of bags since it allows me to create custom sized bags with my Foodsaver. I use the bags for everything from freezing chicken breasts in meal-size portions from the large family packs to vacuum sealing coffee beans until I'm ready to use them to vacuum sealing my passport and other important documents so they won't be affected by exposure to air and moisture. Love them and love the service I've gotten from YardDeals--the item is always as described and I receive the items ordered quickly."
2,"FoodSaver T010-00150-001 3 pack 11"" x 18' Roll",I had a very hard time getting these to seal. I like the bags better
3,"Too short, lacks more material","Yeah, its 'Short, Informative, Useful and Clear' (like someone already said) but... it's not enough. It seems like introductory chapters for a excelent book, but the really important chapters do not exist.Too expensive for 176 pages with tips of XML, regexes, DB and some unix commands."
4,An overview of parsing and mining data with python.,"The book presents the topics in conjunction with showing some practical data mining examples that any person might encounter. This book is recommended to people who are interested in basic parsing of data (text, XML, binary, etc) using python.I got the impression that the author was trying to cover too much in too little space. The title, for example, mentions Java, Python, and more. This is deceiving since the book uses python for about 99% of its examples. And while the book does present Java, it only does so to show that it would be easier to use python. Almost no other languages are covered, although there are some examples in Ruby and Bash."
4,An Old Comfortable Favorite,"A well done film that refreshingly is not the stereo-typical gay eroticism, AIDS, forbidden love or coming out story, although one character is handling the last issue. Characters are likable yet flawed, but not overly melodramatic. The writing is witty and grounded and the acting and production values are quite good. This is a very enjoyable film that tells it's story as if gay life were the mainstream. If quality lighthearted fare with some impact is in your taste, see it. When I first saw it when it was originally released, I thought it would have made a top notch television series, still do. Perhaps the characters were too controversial for broadcast television but not enough so for cable. In league with, but more cohesive than ""Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss"" and ""Kiss me Guido."""
3,An Okay Revolutionary War Book,I'm not to fond of violence and wars but I found this book okay. It covers many details of the war and allowed me to a get a feel of what the war was like for colored people. I think it portrayed the war in a just fashion and I would recogmend this book to teachers who are teaching about the Revolutionary War.
5,War Comes To Willy Freeman,"War Comes to willy freeman is a very good adventure book. Willy is a girl who disguises as a boy. A good part in the book is when Willy finds her mom, because her mom has been gone for a long time. Willy's mother has been gone for a long time because her mom got tooken by the British. Her father also got killed in form of Willy by the brithish. The main thing in the book is that Willy is trying to tell every one that she is free. But the people that she tells do not believe her, because she does not have her papers to prove it."
5,war comes to willy freeman is an awesome book!,"War Comes To Willy Freeman is a good book because it informs you on the history of the US without boring you to death. It is a good book to read for people who like adventures and mysteries. It is one of the most interesting history books i have ever read. If you are in need of a book for school, War Comes To Willy Freeman is the right choice for you!"
3,A little rapperish,i think its cute if you want to be rapper other than that it is a nice piece to have for thise strapless dresses so 50/50 on this piece
4,It's NOT New Guinea! This is African music,"This product's French title is mistakenly translated as ""Children's Songs from . . . New Guinea and Senegal."" In fact the cover art makes clear that it is ""les Chants des Enfants du Monde: Guinée and Sénégal.""There is no material on this collection from the Pacific Island culture of New Guinea, located north of Australia.Guinea in West Africa is a former French colony, the capital is Conakry. Unfortunately this error is replicated in on-line listing by other sellers."
4,Great memories,"Even 30 years later this is still one of my favorite B-movies. It doesn'tpretend to be anything other than what it is. It's a reminder of summers pastwhen your biggest worry was where to have a good time. Hanging out at arcades,drive-ins and the beach. The soundtrack has just been re-issued by originalcomposers Jay Boivin and Germain Gauthier at[...] which alsohas a blog for fans to connect."
5,good buy,wife got these for bride's maids gifts and her friends really enjoyed these and still use them years after our wedding. we got their names embroidered on them and filled them with other cheap stuff and nick nacks.
5,Great overview of his work,An excellent book outlining about 50 of Weegee's photographs currently on display at the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. I saw the exhibit today and was so impressed I picked up the book at the museum bookstore. The book organizes the pictures by subject matter rather than chronological order. He covered the harsh reality of life in New York City from the 1930's through the 1960's. Following the photographs is a short colloquium on Weegee's life.
2,Very Disappointed!,I already had a hardcover Weegee book entitled WEEGEE Naked New York when I purchased Weegee In Focus. I was very surprised that at least half of Naked New York photos were in the In Focus book. That was bad enough but then the photos in the In Focus book measured only 3 3/4 x 4 3/4 inches or smaller. You could not see any detail whatsoever. Each page had a 3 to 4 inch white border with these small b&w photos in the center. This book was certainly not worth the $23.00 (including postage) that I paid. The Photo on the front cover of the man and woman kissing is the size or smaller of the photos inside. Such a waste. I would not recommend this cheap ripoff. I can accept paperback but the small photos I cannot accept.
3,it could use a little help,"the idea is great, you get to play a dragon, I'm sure every Dragon lover nearly wet themselves over the whole ordeal, But look at it closly, the boxed set really isn't all that special, the only thing it had that was not included or hinted at in another TSR product was the listings of Dragon proficiancies, I dont think that was to much to get excited over , I actually feel that I got ripped of by buying it."
2,Samsung products have quirks and kinks.,"After having to replace to other existing Samsung mp3 players, both the YP-F1 XB, I decided to upgrade and pleased that I did. However, the massive storage device is not user friendly at the least, and that's because it wasn't designed to store your homework or Word documents though it does have the capability. The only way you'll be able to save things to it (again and again) is to save it to your desktop and drag it over once you're done with it. Talk about a pain in the bum.Overall I am pleased with this device, though mainly because it comes in a pretty color."
4,Good little MP3 player,The Samsung YP-T7JX is a nice little MP3 player. Obviously a half GB of memory is not going to give you a very extensive playlist. The display is in color and quite nice. The navigation through the menus a piece of cake. FM tuner picks up fairly well. All in all a pretty good bargain.
5,Light Speed Jazz,"I saw Miles play at least 10 times but sadly, not on the night of February 12, 1964 at Lincoln Center, the night his group created light speed jazz at tempos bordering on the unconscious. Tony Williams, the 18 year old prodigy, just took over and made these guys move in a way that simply is astonishing given just how experienced and talented a group this truly was. Every time I listen to this, I am struck by the spacing and openness of the sound and the power this group had in playing tunes they know by heart. It is a masterpiece that, in a round about way, is an up tempo salute to Kind of Blue, the greatest jazz album of all time as many of the compositions here are the same ones that Miles and Bill Evans penned for the earlier work. Absolutely one of the best jazz albums Davis ever did in this humble reviewer's opinion."
4,excellent and a half,"This is Miles breaking in his classic 1960s quartet, minus Wayne Shorter, who did not join until 1965.Most of this is his 1950s material, but played at much faster tempos. I guess Miles wanted to see what his new band could do, and this proves they could not only run, but sprint.This album may not be the casefile of the invention about to come, but Williams and Carter sure had arrived with the goods.Excellent"
5,Stockpot,"I love this! I have wanted one of these for a long time. It is so handy and easy to use and matches the rest of my Faberware. It is a bit larger than I wanted, so I will have to get accustomed to using the larger size."
4,Wendsday is Prince Spaghetti Day,"I cook a lot of pasta, and I really like the convenience of a strainer lid.Most folks say ""use a colander"", but I like to be able to put things in the sink while I am cooking.Doesn't make much sense to stop and do the dishes, in the middle of preparation.I had a crummy Chinese pot, that served its purpose, but the Farberware one is great.No trouble at all to boil a pound and a half of spaghetti."
2,Not worth buying,"Several things are wrong with this pot:1) the lid does not close snugly and there is no cover for the holes so you can't use the pot for anything that requires a tight cover2) the instructions say not to tilt the pot more than 45 degrees, but it is impossible to empty the water at that angle. yet turning the pot further means you get burned by the steam.After being disappointed by this pot, I bought a Calphalon pot with spaghetti and steamer inserts. It is more sturdy and has a better cover so the pot can be used for many tasks. It is more expensive, tho, and costs more."
3,Not impressed,"Good stockpot, but takes too long to strain water. Quicker to use a regular strainer. Also, you can't close whenboiling water, so I felt it took longer to for water to boil."
2,Less than I expected,"I ordered this as a present for my husband, a salesman who tends to get lost but loves gadgets. He was appropriately delighted when he opened it but spent all day (in Los Angeles!) hoping it would find satellites to no avail. Technical support was not helpful. The killing blow was finding out that it does not support an exact street address--it only finds streets. That, and the fact that he would need to download maps before he got in the car each time generated a return slip. Either spend more to get a robust, stand-alone GPS or wait a year or so for the price/performance to improve."
5,A great addition to your Palm,"We have really enjoyed this GPS for our palm; it works well overall, although the size of the maps takes some getting used to (the Palm does not hold many), and the segmenting of maps means you sometimes don't get everything you expect. Works well when loaded however!"
2,Not a very good GPS,"I own a Garmin ETrex and bought one of these Magellans for my PalmVx because of the great form factor and software.In a side-by-side comparison, the Magellan GPS performance was really terrible compared to the Etrex. Often times, the Magellan could not find enough satellites to lock on where the Etrex would be fine. I live in a hilly area, so this really puts the receiver to the test. It seemed to take forever to acquire the satellites.The magellan website said that 20-30 minutes was not uncommon the first time out of the box (since the unit was tested in China). But it never came up very quickly (> 10 minutes), even in subsequent uses.I ended up taking the Magellan back. I guess either I had a faulty unit or the other reviewers that like it so much never used a better GPS.Too bad, because it has a great form factor"
2,Could not get a FIX at all,"I bought it about a week ago. The first fix took about 30mins and since then, I have been unable to get a fix. I called customer service and they were unable to help me either. There are too many bugs with the MAP software and it created some sort of fatal error on my Palm V. Overall, based on my 1 week experience, I would not recommend it."
2,Good hardware but software is very poor,"The actual receiver seems to work just fine, although the clip holding it to the Palm is not exactly secure. I was able to get it up and running in under 10 minutes. My first fix came in about 30 sec. The software is another story. The two programs are terribly designed. It you wish to use this GPS for its mapping capabilities, you will need other software. I wanted to use it in may car for navigation. Although it can always tell me what my lat/long are, it is not very helpful in placing it on a map. The documentation is non existant. It is hard to believe that there is no ability to enter an address and have it give you directions like MapQuest does. You also have to sync every individual map you will want from the CD-ROM. The problem is that they are all organized by COUNTY! (Each county map is about 100k.) If someone designed some good software for this it would be a great 5 star product."
4,US or International location streetmaps,"This is one of the only products I know that have street maps available of the US (Magellan-supplied software) and many countries in Europe (web software Route). I use it to navigate around Europe when there on vacation or on business trips, especially helpful when you don't know your way around. It makes it easy in helping to locate highway turnoffs as you drive, and helps you find and get you to your destination much more easily than not having a street mapping GPS. I have used it with map chart program in 5 countries in Europe plus in the US!"
3,GPS. Global or Not?,"The word is that the GPS Companion for Palm is not accurate when used outside the origin country. To quote the manufacturer, ""The US product will not work accurately in Australia due to different geodetic parameters used to relate positions on the earth"""
3,Too limited and with some problems,"I buyed it from here, first it is very limited, you cannot transfer the data to a pc, to process it or print. The softwares are not very good.And theres is a problem, it hangs and dont recognizes the gps, like is not attached to the palm, and you have to reinstall the software in the palm to use it. I dont like it, is not very usefull."
1,Buy something else,"I'm a computer engineer and work building fiber-optic transports for computer networks, and I have yet to get this thing to work in any appreciable or useful way. It looks neat, and the idea behind it, obviously, is way cool. However, it just plain doesn't work. I've stood for 15 minutes in a wide-open section of Golden Gate park trying to get it to find a signal -- no luck."
2,This one is not so good,The help file is too simple and ambiguous. The system can't receive the GPS signal correct and I just can't get my own position at all. I just had navcomp correctly worked for once and the other one(map compa) won't work at all. Overall this product is very poor
4,Yummy...,"This is one of my favorite candy. It's perfect for my sweet craving, fruity, soft, really yummy.The only negative part is that it's expensive with the shipping..."
5,"Good candy, but look for the 12 pack from amazon","This candy was excellent, very soft and fresh still. Tastes almost like strawberry marshmallows more than a gummy. However it was 6 dollars for one pretty small bag, because it is an import.http://www.amazon.com/Haribo-Gummi-Candy-Strawberries-5-Ounce/dp/B000EVQWKW/ref=pd_sbs_gro_12 Amazon has almost the exact same thing, 12 packs for $14 so closer to 1 dollar per pack instead of 6. If you love this candy, that's the way to go."
2,Product is not fresh,"Purchased these for my wife as a gift. She grew up eating these candies and many other Haribo candies. While she likes the Primavera Strawberries, she was disappointed to find out that the bag she received was stale tasting. This did not prevent her from eating the bag in one setting. I recommend that the vendor turn the inventory more quickly."
3,"Only 70+ minutes, Stereo 2 channel","I pre-ordered this DVD before it is released, and did not have any information i.e. length of concert, audio format (dts, Dolby 5.1 or Dolby 2 ch) when I ordered it. When I received it, I played it at once with great expectation. However, I was somewhat disappointed to note that only about 16 songs were included in the DVD (as compared with 24 songs in the CD set). Moreover, the aduio is only 2 channel that sounds a bit inferior with my 5.1 channel AV system. The most valuable part of this DVD, indeed, is the footages of 3 previous concerts with Don at his peak. But one of them is of rather poor sound & picture quality. Neverthless, this DVD is worth buying for Don's friend as it is the only Don's DVD available in market."
4,Tuned in,"I saw this video on PBS 2 years ago, but all that was available was the VHS. I'm a child of the 60's and a mother of the 70's and my kids grew up knowing that ""American Pie"" was their Dad's and my song. They think we're weird. Perhaps we are. Who cares?They know all the lyrics to many of Don's songs by heart, so I guess we did something right. I have looked everywhere for a DVD of this concert and the only place I could find it was Amazon! Thank you!"
3,"Don McLean: Starry, Starry Night","There were some songs from the concert I was expecting to see on the DVD and they were not presented. It almost appeared that the DVD may not have been professionally produced, but I am not a production expert so I could be incorrect with that impression. It was okay, but it did not blow me away."
1,Informative but low quality,"The information presented on the Bennett DVDs is good. Unfortunately the quality is terrible. Basically it looks like someone simple dubbed their VHS versions of these onto DVDs. They didn't even do a decent job of setting up the DVD menus. I would not recommend these to others. I picked up mine cheap off of eBay, but there's no way I'd pay retail for material of such low presentation quality."
5,Good video,I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and hope that Lewis will become a new series. Good entertainment. JFC
3,Why only 1 episode?,"I would like to give this series a chance before I decide what I think of it. I was never that impressed with Inspector Morris (sorry!) but I kinda got into this. Here's my problem: There were 4 episodes in the 1st season and only the 1st episode was released in the U.S. which hardly gives it a fair chance. Release the full season, or, really go out on a limb and release the 2nd season too. ""Inspector Morris"" had 33 episodes is it asking too much to see a meager 4 of ""Inspector Lewis""?"
3,Likeable Lewis,The second banana takes center stage in this agreeable return to Oxford. He's by no means as compelling a character as Morse (nor is the actor in John Thaw's league) but most anyone will end up rooting for both.
5,Our own Robbie makes good...,"Kevin Whately fills our hearts with the welcome renewed pleasure of a Morse mystery--post Morse. It is fitting that Inspector Morse's long shadow haunt this first case in which Inspector Lewis returns to Oxford. I can only hope that the great writing and enthusiastic acting that characterised the original series will give new and legitimate life to this new one. I never tired of Morse's stories and if subsequent episodes continue in the searching and clever twists and turns of the original ones, I will become an undying fan to the point of creating Lewis' own website ([...]).I unreservedly recommend this Hamlet-esque episode to all Morse fans. To those lovers of mystery and police thrillers who haven't discovered the ecstasy of a Morse adventure, I recommend acquainting yourselves with the excellent 33 episodes of Inspector Morse plus this new one."
4,Not quite Morse,"Although this is not quite Inspector Morse, it did a good job of handling the memory of Morse by including a few references to him. References were made to his puzzle solving etc.Lewis was his usual self and did a good job as the leading character. I don't know if this is a one off or the start of a new series.Recommended for fans of British mysteries."
4,GOOD MYSTERIES,"WE LIKE INSPECTOR MORRIS, SO DEFINITELY ENJOY INSPECTOR LEWIS SOLVING MYSTERIES TOO. GOOD STORIES, AND DEFINITELY WANT TO WATCH MORE OF THIS SERIES."
1,Save Your Money,"The 58 minute video has some captain sitting at a desk, holding his coffee cup and reading off a teleprompter. He rattles off rules of the road, lights, day flags and chart info with very little graphics or video of boats performing the functions. I couldn't keep up with the difference between inland/coastal/international horn or bell sounds.I've seen better productions on local cable access channels.If I had found this DVD in the $4.99 rack at Walmart, I still would have felt I paid too much."
1,Not a very good vidio/DVD.,This is not what it's presented to be to me. It's a fast talking lecture with a few flash-in pictures. Some of it is not even in color as you would expect for what it cost.
1,Worst money I ever spent...,"I should have read the reviews. This video is the equivalent of trying to cram 4 years of higher education into 58 minutes. The ""Reader"" (instructor) blows through topics so quickly that you're still mentally on the first topic when the end credits are rolling. Only the Micro-Machine commercial guy could have blown through this faster. It should be illegal to sell something this bad.If you're trying to take a short cut to your captain's license, don't do it. Sign up for a REAL USCG class. They're expensive, but only about 10 times the cost of this over-priced steaming pile. I wouldn't even check this out for free from the local library. I have wasted 58 minutes of my life. Is there a rating less than one star?"
1,Do not buy this video!,From the very start the boats used in diagrams to teach rules of the Road are BACKWARDS! I tried to contact the compnay and all they did was offer another video. This is from 2007 and should have been fixed! There are some good online sites to learn and practise for the license exam.
3,Don't try this at home.,"Good stunts, decent production value. Prefer Road Rage II DVD, which has best scenes from C and I and alot more."
4,"Great, but deja vu...","This DVD is pretty well produced with a great soundtrack and great footage, and there's only one reason it's not getting 5 stars...because there's only so many times I can watch wheelies without getting bored...Sure, there's lots of other tricks, but the majority of the footage is long wheelies on the highway. More footage of the smaller tricks, or even more crashes instead would have been much better.Overall, a great DVD - enough that I'm going to consider buying their 2 other ones they have out!"
3,Diamond band,"I thought the ring matched a wrap very well that I had bought, but when compared to the clarity of my diamond it was not a match and without the wrap that didn't fit my setting it was not flush so I returned it."
4,Good first effort,"While I don't think that Brooke Valentine's album will make as much noise as a much bigger artist, this is a good first effort. She patterns the songs like a chain letter or writing in a diary. She chews up the men on a few songs. She might have been inspired by Alanis Morissette a little bit with I Want You Dead. Girlfight shows her more defensive side. But I like the many street driven songs in the album's middle. On some songs she sounds a little bit like Beyonce, but that ends after three songs and it's more of Brooke herself. For a singer that went through 200 songs (sorry, too pop, sorry, too bland, okay I'll take song #54, that one has hot beats, that one has a good live band, that one is nice, and so forth) just to choose the 15 tracks for this album, these songs fit her style very well. I wish her the best in her music career."
2,Okay!!!,"I'm listening to this album as well speak and I don't like it at all only one song that is Cover Girl other then that I will bot be Buying this...that song blah,blah, blah makes the whole album look bad...It's not a good listen..."
5,No ordinary chain letter....,"Don't let the opener, ""Girlfight"", sway you. This album is not another one of those ""let's rehash the same beat with different lyrics (like Ciara did)"" albums. Brooke Valentine does an excellent job of mixing up the club-anthem hits and slow ballads, with all of them sounding strong and very soulful. ""Ghetto Superstarz"" has to be one of the highlights on this superior effort. Another great tune is ""Tell Me Why You Don't Love Me"". ""Taste of Dis"" finds Brooke shakin' her thing on the dancefloor, and there are several hot dance numbers on this CD. This girl has a really great voice and can really go places. Please stop comparing her to Ciara, because there is really no comparison there! Take a listen to this chain letter....you won't be disappointed in what you hear."
4,brooke...a good start off...,"I loved the album, it had its downs though, im pretty sure her taste in music ranges from pop to r&b;, to a lil bit of rock. Although the album shines the most in tracks like girlfight, I want you dead, Long as you come home, cover girl, and dying of a broken heart, it couldve left out some of the tracks...the album would have been much better if the track listing were this:1.girlfight2.taste of dis3.long as you come home4.blah blah blah5.covergirl6.playa7.ghetto superstarz8.tell me why? (you dont love me)9.million bucks10.I want you dead11.dying from a broken heartand thats it ,i think laugh ""till i cry"" isnt a strong ballad like dying from a broken heart, ""american girl"" doesnt belong here, ""pass us by"" is a hard attempt at making a record, and ""whatcha looking at"" is forgettable, i love the album minus a few songs...all in all its a great album must buy!!!!"
5,"Love It! Bangin beats, energy, attitude!","Released in 2005: chicago radio played only Girlfight, & did not promote Brooke V after that, those bums. Here it is 2011 & om jus writing a review. A Great variety, well produced, full of passion, attitude, energy. Another album perfect for jammin in da car or scaring the stuffy neighbors. Several other reviewers do an excellent job describing the individual tracks, I refer you to them.I wish Brooke would collaborate and drop another bangin album. She da bomb!I love this set so much I just ordered my 2nd copy."
1,Total Fluff,"Honestly, i'm gonna keep this review short and simple. Cause it doesn't require very much explanation. Brooke Valentine is your typical R&B; cookie cutter, manufactured ""talent"". A dolled up little girl with a decent voice, and loosely penned mediocre material. This girls not a talent that'll be around for ages, she'll be here today and gone tomorrow. Just like me, you may be tempted by the fact that it's under $10 bucks, but I can name about 10 albums off the top of my head that you'd be better of getting. For instance, this years most slepped on diamond in the ruff...Concrete Rose by Ashanti. Fantasia Borrino, or Mariah's latest release.""Girlfight"" is totally a guilty pleasure, and laughable. Yet if the entire album would've followed this formula, It would've been half decent. I find it hilarious people are selling off 'I Want You Dead' as this years 'I Hate You So Much Right Now'. That's laughable, this song is corny and not ballsy in the least. Skip this stale effort at all cost."
2,Save Your Money!,"When Girlfight came out, it was the bomb. The first single just misleads you into buying this CD though. I only like Girlfight and Ghetto Superstarz and at the end of that it has an annoying interlude you wish you could just cut off the song. And I Wish You Were Dead. Who wrote that s**t? It is stupid as h**l. Brooke here's some advice. Before wishing someone was dead listen to your voice. It sounds dead on this CD."
3,Some pleasant surprises under the mainstream stuff.,"She was introduced to the world by her first, hardcore single, ""Girlfight."" Including the producer of the moment (Lil' Jon) and the rapper of the moment.(Big Boi of Outkast)It was sure to be a big hit, which it was. But with such a silly song, she became considered a novelty act. (""Girlfight"" was a completely misleading single to release as a debut.)But actually this CD has some unique material on here. ""American Girl"" has some clever lyrics and a nice beat in the backround. ""I Want You Dead"" is such an eclectic song. It's so unique and very catchy. But other, more mainstream material, like the poorly produced Jermaine Dupri ""Playa"", bring this album down."

But other, more mainstream material, like the poorly produced Jermaine Dupri ""Playa"", bring this album down."
3,I give this album 3 1/2 stars...,"This album is indeed original. But there is a difference between being original and being absolutely ridiculous! Now Brooke does have talent, and she can sing, but a lot of the songs on this album are just stupid. Plain & Simple...like ""I want you Dead""-what the fu**!!!!""Million Bucks""-this song is kinda dumb...But there are highlights in the album...like ""Long as you come home"",""Blah, Blah, Blah"", ""Cover Girl"", ""Playa"", and even ""Ghetto Super starz"" but the rest this album can do without.But the album is growing on me.Peace"
3,It's Okay,"I didn't feel that good feeling of music when I was listening to this record there were a few good jams Cover Girl and laugh til I cry...but there were a couple I pasted up... Taste This, Blah, Blah, Blah, Ghetto Superstaz...there were more...it's okay...but not there yet!"
1,This Album SUCKS!,"I don't have much to say about the album except that it SUCKS! It's not what I expected. Her single ""Girl Fight"" was a cover up. Had she stuck to this style of music she might have been alright. Don't get me wrong, the girl can sing but she needs to make wiser decisions as far as the compostion of her CD."
2,"14"" J&J Barrell","it works ok improved my accuracy but still has a problem after about 15 feet then the balls go everywhere.. im gonna try the 16"" and see if it does any better. but overall its a good barrel your not wasting your money for the price."
4,Pictures From Another Time,"Upon its publication, this was the most complete volume on Kara Walker that I had come across. The essays are well written and informative, and delve deeper into various aspects of the artist's work than had previous reviews which often focus solely on the racial controversy of Walker's work. The interview with Thelma Golden provides some insight into possible future directions that Walker contemplates with her work. The images and color plates included in the book are of high quality and are representative of much of Walker's work, not only her installation at the University of Michigan."
2,Overcharged!,"When I received this book I found that the seller was charging almost 3 times the retail price, for a recent book that was not a special edition. I consider this price gouging."
1,Way over priced!!!,"Every time I go to my local Walmart they have tons of these stocked and they sell for less than $4, I don't know why people would pay this much!"
4,My son LOVES these cars.,"We have been lucky enough to have a store nearby (and grandparents who spoil rotten) that carried all of the cars from Lightning even to Lizzie and Sarge. My 2 year old carries these cars around in a little pouch everywhere. We let him take one to bed and every night he says, ""Hmmm...what cars you want today?"" They are so sturdy and I feel comfortable with these cars because the only small parts are the wheels which are pretty hard to pull off (I tried). The only bad thing I would have to say is that the paint comes off - not easily, but easier than the Matchbox cars, probably because there is more detail. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend these hands down. They keep us busy at church and restaurants, and cure when we have severe melt downs."
5,an awesome toy!,"I LOVED this ball when I was a kid. I was so glad my parents got me the big blue one, because my little sister grew out of her red one (the medium size, I believe) pretty quickly, but the big one is big enough even for adults when freshly inflated.I give it 5 stars for what it is, but I have one warning: After many years the rubber still looked fine, but one day my then-teenage sister was using it as a computer chair and it spontaneously burst beneath her. (No she wasn't hurt and yes it was hilarious.)So if you manage not to pop this thing prematurely, it's probably a good idea to replace it after a few years anyway."
1,hop 66,bought two each popped with about 5 minutes of use. The older model with the valve stem in the handle rather than in the bottom of the ball would last for years. they cheapened a great product.
5,My Son Loves It,I got this for my son. He wanted one after his sister got one as a present. I can't get him off of it. He loves it and he is 12.
5,EXCELLENT,This is a great toy for kids AND adults!!! This will hold up to 300 lbs. so not only is my son having a blast but I'm getting a great workout!!!
4,Just what we wanted,My 9 yr. old daughter has been asking for this for so long. I didn't think they made them for older kids. When we found this she was so excited!! It is made so well and will last for a long time.
4,Hippity Hoppity Fun,"I'm 5'4"" and it fits me fine. However, my friend who is 5'2"" and almost 200 pounds felt that this ball was too small for him. I think it was his weight. He said when he bounced on it, his knees when up to high so it kind of hurt. Other than that, it's very durable and it has remained fully inflated since Christmas time! One note, it's not as easy to use as you think! Well, maybe it's just that we're not kids anymore!"
2,"More for looking at, then playing with",The figures are very pretty and very beautiful. My daughter is not rough with her toys at all and these have all broken off from the base. They are not attached very well or they seem to flex to much and then snap off. We have filed off the broken plastic and now they can't stand alone but my daughter still plays with them frequently. We have many other disney sets like this and never had the breaking problem.
5,Comfortable Hammock,I bought this Hatteras hammock to replace a Pawley's Island hammock whose support bar broke after a few years. I wanted a hammock that was truly comfortable to lie in for a nap or to read a book and this one is perfect. It looks good and is restful and very soft to lie in. A perfect hammock for summertime snoozing.Hatteras SQ-WEAVE-GR Soft Weave Forest Green Woven - Large Quilted Hammock
5,Soft enough for you face!,I love this hammock and its accessories. What a high quality product! Would not change a thing. And I bought pillow and stand as well.
1,weave does not stay put and stitching frayed,"I bought this hammock last year and found that the weave moves apart in some areas and bunches up in others when you lay on in. The user has to get off the hammock to redistribute the fabric with their hands. Also the hammock becomes a sail if left out in any sort of breeze which made the stand and hammock tip over with a child in it! The stitching that holds the weave together broke and now there are tears near the grommets. I bought this after reading the other reviews. It is comfortable (until the weave moves, or the hammock is blown over by the wind, or the stitching is frayed) it does not wear well, but it does dry quicker than a cotton hammock however, I suggest you use you money for something else."
5,Pretty solid,If you're looking for something original and something to rock your sox off; you've found it. Pivot is one of those great up and coming bands that mixes great hard rock with amazing lyrics. With songs like Precious Words and Killing Himself this is one band to look out for. They're currently working on their next album and from what I hear its going to be way better than the first two. Look out for them all www.pivotrocks.com
1,Simply Terrible!!!,"This is the the worst DVD I have bought relative to Boating/Boat Handling.The Video quality that of a poor home made video, and the Audio is overshadowed with constant and very loud wind noise that not only makes what is being said hard to hear but extremly annoying.Now onto the video contents. First off, for the two narrators who are supposed to have 25 yrs of boating experience each, I ask -- Did anyone ever tell you that you are instructing how to tie a line onto a dock cleat incorrectly?This DVD is complete trash. I realize that I only paid $19 for it (ie. suggested retail is around $34 or $39) but it is worthless. I just threw it into the garbage, and believe me I'm not in the habit of throwing my money away.Don't get ripped off. Stay away from this product as it is worthless."
1,"Low quality, but informative","The information presented on the Bennett DVDs is good. Unfortunately the quality is terrible. Basically it looks like someone simple dubbed their VHS versions of these onto DVDs. They didn't even do a decent job of setting up the DVD menus. I would not recommend these to others. I picked up mine cheap off of eBay, but there's no way I'd pay retail for material of such low presentation quality."
2,works - but was not clean,"Juicer was in working condition, but had not been cleaned properly. There were food particles in the strainer/filter and the pieces had to be soaked and scrubbed to get them off. The spout was dirty and the key has a deep gouge in it. After we spent time throughly cleaning all the pieces, it seems to work as expected."
4,"I like it, but the screen is hard to clean...","...the screen is the only thing I would like to see changed on this machine. It is built well, it is quiet, it is fast. Disassembly and reassembly is fast and easy, but that screen almost always has to be put in the dishwasher to get it clean."
2,About twenty years out of date. Save your money!,"Dear Friends:I can't even remember how long ago this was compiled, but it must be at least twenty years ago! I've had the pleasure to have written, edited, or co-authored about about forty books since then. For some more recent data, see[...] With warmest wishes -- Richard N. (""Dick"") Cté, December 8, 2008."
4,Evil has a Temple,I'm looking forward to continuing the saga of Village of Hommlet. This looks promising and I'm very excited about running it.
4,dc ep review,This is an amazing ep with 4 perfectly crafted pop songs. John's singing is really good here and the backing vocals are really ethereal sounding. The guitar playing is really good and the songwriting is some of the best that he has done ever. This is pretty much what i have been waiting for him to do since niandra. Buy it if you like ANY of his music at all. Beautiful.
2,Worst of them all,"i dont like this much. the first song is good. not worth buying. so many better frusciante cds ie, Niandra laDes! To record onlt water for ten days"
1,I would recommend you consider other options,"The ""over the ear"" rubber arm attaches to the main body via a swivel mechanism. That mechanism does NOT allow the rubber arm to swing out, but rather, it allows it to only rotate (like a ferris wheel). Because of that limited range of motion, the hinge can easily break (which it did in my case). Too bad, because the sound and range were great."
4,Sony ericsson Bluetooth,I got this item for my boyfriend for his birthday & he loves it. It's got great sound quality and good reception.
4,Works the Best. Hurts my ear.,"This is my 4th bluetooth headset, and it is by far the best working headset. It is clear. I can hear while driving, people can hear me like I am talking into the phone.My one complaint is that it doesn't fit well on my ear. If they had made the ear loop another 1/4"" I would be giving this 5 stars. Instead it never feels exactly right, and ends up hurting my ear if I wear it for extended periods.I'm keeping it, but I am looking for a different way to attach it to my ear."
4,Nice headset,"The fit takes some adjusting and getting used to. But once you swivel the ear loop to your ear sizing, then it sits ok - not as snug as other headsets, but light and comfortable.The battery is the best part of this set - all headset descriptions seem to exagerate battery life, and this one is no exception. So given it claims 12 hour talk time, I'd have settled for half that, compared to just barely two hours on other sets. This one lasts two good days with talking several hours each day. Simple to use. I like it."
4,Seems to be a good little headset...,"Neat little headset, light in weight, decent sound and fits well around the ear. You won't even know that you have it on. The on/off & volume buttons can easily found when worn and the sound is very clear.I purchased this headset because both Sony Ericsson & Cingular told me that this headset would be compatible with my Sony Ericsson Z525A. It worked just like any other headset except that it was not fully compatible as they had stated. I was able to pick-up and release calls but could not voice dial or answer. Although a very nice headset, I would up returning it."
2,"Sony Ericsson Bluetooth Headset HBH-PV705, Silver",Does not wrong with all models. This unit kept disconnecting from my LG cell phone.
1,poor,I was very upset when we opened the bluetooth and the box and contents were scattered in the shipping box. Right now we cannot get the bluetooth to work properly. At this time we are contacting Sony.I would not buy electronics again on Amazon.
4,"Good Earpiece, but has drawbacks","The Sony Ericsson Bluetooth HBH-PV705 Headset is a good earpiece for the value.Positives: Light, comfortable, and has great talk time (battery life).Negatives: Short range from phone, weak voice recognition, and can echo speech to the other party on occasion."
3,Review of HBH-PV705 Headset,"I have had Motorola, Plantronic, and Jabra headset and this one is the best for connection and use. The headset picks up surrounding sound and this causes the sending side of the audio to clip and you miss a lot of the conversation. This occurs in the car with the air conditioning running so it is not the best. The Motorola and Jabra headset do the same thing so there is no improvement with this headset. The Plantronic is a little better, but it is an old Voyager 510 so the technology is not very good. If you don't mind keeping your environment noise free then this headset will work fine and the reception and audio is good."
3,Product is Good but hurts your Ear,"Hi,I've been using Sony Ericsson HBH PV705 bluetooth for almost 3 weeks. signal strength is good. covers almost 30 ft. Excellent battery life.The only drawback is, it hurts your ear if you wear it for long times especially if you wear glasses. may be after using it for a while, get accustomed to it.Thanks"
2,Cheap Hard Plastic,"This headset is constructed of cheap, hard plastic. The ear loop is uncomfortable, especially when worn with glasses. The ear loop's bulk is the main culprit."
3,"Good sound quality, but a bad fit.","I love Sony Ericsson products, so I bought this with their reputation in mind. The sound quality and ease of use was great, but it was a very awkward fit for my ear. The ear peace broke off eventually from the awkward fit and strain. I can still superglue it back on and use it because I really liked the sound quality, but they could have designed it better."
2,I hoped for better!,"I purchased the HBH-PV 705 after trying a recently purchased a stripped down replacement model of the 608, which I returned. I was initally replacing the Sprint version of the 608 which I really enjoyed, but I misplaced. I liked the Sprint version the best. With the HBH-PV 705, I experience scratchy sound as close as 2 to 3 feet of the cell phone...much worse if it further away. I can't comment on use time since I can't wear this model for any extended period of time. It is much more uncomfortable for me than the Sprint version of the 608 even though they are very similar in style. Even the lanyard attachment method is extremely cumbersome, especially for good size male fingers to manipulate, and is certainly a last minute afterthought at best."
2,Craptastic Lanyard,"I won't get into whether or not it works on a technical level or not, as I haven't had this for more than a day. But it's an awful lanyard design, if you're the type that doesn't feel like wearing it in your ear all day. really no way to clip this to something, instead you've got to have a 3"" string hanging from it that then has a loop on it, so you look like you're wearing some kind of idiot pirate earring or something. And that ring and the necklace that ship with the earpiece are such that you can't quickly or easily detach the headset from said necklace.Anybody want to buy a new (packaging opened but device not used for more than 5 minutes) HBH-PV705 cheap?"
4,"Wonderful, but pretty squeaky clean","This Texas Trilogy came highly recommended from many sources and they were beautiful love stories, but too clean for me. I need my spice not necessarily full on erotica, but more sexual play than this. Texas Destiny wasn't my favorite of series just because it took to long for the H/h to get together, someone needed to step up. Although the get-together did choke me up a bit because you didn't want anyone to get hurt. Great for someone who likes good wholesome romances."
4,Very good but...,I won't go over the plot as most reviewers already have. I really enjoyed this book and I would actually say it's the best of the trilogy but I wasn't happy at all that Austin so easily forgave his best friend and his ex-girlfriend. I'm not happy that they got off that easily. They're people with no loyalty and the author should have made those characters pay for what they did to poor Austin. But the love story between Austin and Loree was well done and this book is a wonderful ending to the Leigh brothers trilogy.
2,A big disappointment,"This book had very little conflict and plot. The first couple of chapters delivered a terrific story premise. I thought Austin would find the killer and clear his name. That appeared to be his goal. A hundred pages later he's married the pregnant heroine and taken her home to his family Next is bunch of sweet romantic incidents and big family moments. The only thing of interest was the heroine's big secret, which after a while, got old and evident and it led to one of the most contrived endings I've read in ages."
2,A good book that became obsolete since November CTP,I'm reading this book in my workplace.The book is giving a good coverage of the framework and the ways one can use it.The problem is the book relies heavily on examples and the code for these examples is obsolete.It seems Microsoft has drawn back some of the generic classes that appear in this book.I'm currently using the Microsoft examples supplied with the SDK documentation. But theses examples relies on onfiguration files which is quite different than the DIY approach the book has taken. So it's really hard combining this with reading the book.My suggestion is:Wait for a release of the book that is updated for the current WCF / Indigo version.
3,What Some Will Do When Provoked!,"He was the best Confederate general of the entire Civil War, according to his superior. Born in Chapel Hill, Tennessee, into a well-to-do family, he was a Southerner born and bred for greatness. After the war, he had ties in Memphis, (a world away from the values and customs of Middle Tennessee) where a park including a statue of him is in existence. There is an unusual statue of him outside Nashville on I65; look for the Confederates flags and you'll marvel at this site created and paid for by a prominent lawyer. This slanderous book (all Myths) was devised by two UTK English professors with false information from Memphis sources."
2,Book review,"I read the book, ""Kinship: It's all Relative"", but was not impressed with it. The author seemed to be ""looking down her nose"" at the reader. Her explanations for kinship were not truly clear, at least to me."
3,Misled...,"I also thought this was all three movies on one DVD. Not until I actually read the back of the DVD flip-case did I realize it's a ""best of"" compilation. It's 65 minutes long compared to almost 180 minutes of the three movies combined."
3,Dont Be Fooled,"This Slednecks Vid is awsome, its just that the review made it seem like i was going to get all of the vidio's in whole, and it is just a mix of some of the best clips of all three of the slednecks vidios. In my opinion, i would just by maybe slednecks three or get two if you are going to by any of them. It is nice to be able to see all of the whole movie instead of clips from all three mixed around."
2,Dalla Piazza Drizzler,"Ordered two, one was broken upon arrival. Packaging was less than required to prevent breakage. Drizzler works great!"
1,CRAP,this is the biggest piece of crap i have ever had. no wait that is too much of a compliment. a rock will fly better. you might as well wrap a ton of rocks in lead and throw it . in the first ten seconds it broke. i want refund . no wait this deserves 10 refunds. they should pay you to get it in the first place.
1,Piece of junk,"How did anyone give this thing a five star review?! It's a piece of round plastic. You could get about four of them out of a 2-liter soda bottle. I gave it five stars for educational value because I learned that I can be suckered by good reviews of a really cheap piece of stuff. Needless to say, I'm not happy with this type of education at my age! I now will be paying shipping to send it back, which means I may get a credit of a buck or two when all is said and done. Where else can you get educated for nine dollars?!"
4,Legit but hard,"This is certainly the real deal. But like any other flying toy, it takes a lot of practice. I keep throwing it such that it bends left a lot when it slows down."
3,Work just like it says but ouch.,"Some will argue with me about this, but,I had one of these when I was younger about 10 years ago and I liked it. It's work just fine. Even for a young kid like I was at the time I could make it fly really far.HOWEVER, It's waited at the front so catching it is tricky and sometimes painful.Still, I think it's pretty cool"
4,Fun and Easy,This is great fun for kids and adults alike. My 8yr old learned to throw it long distances in under 1hr of practicing.
1,Did not get the right product,"I did not receive the right product and had to return it, was not very happy when it was the wrong item, oh well."
4,Fun Outdoor Toy,"We had so much fun playing with these with our grandson that we bought more Gyro Tosses for other ""kids"" we know."
3,Marketing hype doubtful,"While this ""toy"" is a novelty, we couldn't get the Gyro Toss to fly the distances, claimed on the youtube clip or in the advertising material.Doesn't quite have the same sense of enjoyment as a frisbee.The Gyro Toss is fun to play with but after 45 minutes, the novelty factor has disappeared."
4,Nice guitar sound!,"Steven's songs are intricately woven, providing an entertaining listening experience. Every song has a melody that plays into itself, so every listening session is a new one. I enjoy playing this CD in the background while I work at my computer. It helps me to relax and also to bring fresh ideas into mind. I like the acoustic guitar sound as it is very tangible, especially on track 10 ""If Only"", where you can hear the guitar strings reverberate. You can hear his fingers working the strings...I look forward to his next CD!"
1,FUBAR,"wrong gauge, wrong words and or wrong photo?the photo shows white face.looking on equus site the photo here is correct and the words are wrong.way to go amozoned."
1,very disappointed,"I was very upset when I received this product. The bottom on the mold was cracked and the face on the groom is to ""cartoony"" looking. Tried to use it for a wedding and the brides head broke off leaving us with no decorative ice."
2,See him live instead,"You will hate yourself for buying this, depending on how you feel about blending the line between male and female in various situations, namely while listening to a bald white guy try to sound like Prince. But Har Mar still rocks, and unfortunately this is the best album he has made to prove it."
4,pretty good music,"I would recommend listening to Har Mar Superstar if you like some upbeat music with some catchy tunes.However, If you are at all uncomfortable with middle-aged balding men with beer-guts stripping on stage and humping walls, I would not recommend seeing him live. It was quite the...interesting experience, but it was worth it to see the amazing Ben Lee."
3,"Carnation: The first 75 years, 1899-1974",A good reference book to help me with the genealogy of my grandfather who worked for the Carnation Company for 45 years.
3,Fascinating history but less than expected,"When I read about this book, I was fascinated and very intrigued. I just finished the book and I have to say that I just wasn't impressed. The ending is a bit of a surprise, but getting there is much too long and drawn out, almost as if the author needed to add details to try to show you as much of the atmosphere, history, and people as he could. At times this really bogs down the story, too much attention to detail. And at times I didn't always feel I was there. Some parts seemed anachronistic and at one point the author points out when fingerprinting is first introduced, but this is later than the 1899 of the book, too jarring. It is definitely a good read for a trip, which is when I read it, but I was left with a feeling of ""the book is OK""."
4,Another good book by this author.,"They Jekyl Island Club was the first book I read by this author. I thoroughly enjoyed it so my husband, who is very particular about what he reads as he is very careful how he spends his time, also decided to read it and he too thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, we both have now read all his other books about famous men's clubs and we are sorry that he seems to not be writing any more. It is an interesting work of fiction, based on fact, with a mystery entwined. It is well written, keeps your attention, and you learn something about a period in our history with the real individuals as characters situated in a real place that still exists. But Jekyll Island now is no longer the private club of the extremely rich but a state park. Worth your time."
5,A Readie Read,"This vovel took a while to read. It was very wordy, but I still enjoyed it. I was amazed to think that higher class people thought they could get away with devious plots. The location was meaningful to me since I vacationed in the club house in May. When you stay at the location of the story, I think it is easy to picture scenes in your mind. This novel is a mix of fiction with history."
5,Another great vacation read!,"Monahan has written another, but quite unique, piece of atmosphere and plot that I could not put down. I just wish I had saved it for my vacation in Maui. Perfect for the beach. Best read in broad daylight!"
3,Mesh Bands,"Mesh Band is not pliable and I sometimes run into problems fastening and unfastening the buckle. Also the stem almost came off , when I went to reset the hands. Fortunately I was able to push it back into place. I like the big face which is easy to read."
5,A Delightful Gift Book,"I recieved this precious book upon the birth of my son. Not only was it a special way to celebrate the unknown (there were no boys born into my family prior to my son) but it filled me with excitement and hope for the future. It was fun reading about famous men becoming fathers, little boys before they were famous, and boys in literature. Also, I am an avid scrapbooker and this book provided me with many wonderful poems and quotes. After integrating them into the pages of my son's scrapbooks, I found that they add a special dimension to his photographs. I heartily recommend this book as a lovely shower gift to any friend expecting a son. I guarantee any Mommy or Daddy will treasure it as I have."
5,Jericho DVD,Brilliant. We also have the second series and are hoping for more to be produced. Low key but gritty. Love the cars shown in the series. I am old enough to identify every single one shown.Buy and enjoy.
1,Dreadful,"This could be the worst British mystery series I've ever seen. The period setting basically involves a few costumes and extras milling around on dimly lit streets. Jericho is an interesting character but his haunting visions of his father's death just drag the story down. His team of detectives come out of some stockpot of stereotypes; the crusty but trusted older inspecter and the eager, but clumsy constable. The plots are filled with endless cliches and overheated acting that would make East Enders look like Shakespear. Awful, awful, awful."
5,Excellent Book for every developer,This book is a great introduction to the Agile Development process. This is one of those books that should be read by any developer.
4,Movie,Love this movie. I am planning to use it of my Spanish class. I cannot wait to show it to them.
3,"Beautifully filmed Colombian ""Crossroads"" tale.","Beautifully filmed Colombian ""Crossroads"" tale. Despite the stunning location filming the movie drags out a familiar story. There are a few original contributions to the tale but the star of the movie really is the countryside."
1,way too slow some vague axiom blowing in the wind,I did not watch it all the way through and even if it picked up later on it did not entertain me enough to stay on board.There is some kind of axiom about profundity and silent greatness going on. As if the tip of the ice-berg of this great accordion player is somehow self- explanatory but it is not. A few flash-backs on this man's life would have abetted this film enormously.Never mind tip of the berg it would have given it a point.
5,"Beautiful scenery, an even more beautiful story.","This film was beautiful! It highlights the lives of Ignacio, an older man who formerly played an accordion and Fermin, an aspiring musician. A tale of love, loss, friendship and hope, the film highlights a number of deep emotions that leaves the viewer wanting more.Taking place in South America, the film offers amazing views in every scene along with a very detailed storyline. The score to the film is beautifully done as well! If you love foreign films, you definitely need to check this out."
5,A breathtaking story of friendship between two musicians,"""The Wind Journeys"" takes the audience on a beautiful ride through the budding relationship between Ignacio, a former-accordion player, and Fermin, an aspiring musician.With breathtaking views of South America, a dramatic and suspenseful storyline, and a beautifully crafted score by Ivan ""Tito"" Ocampo, this film is a definite must-see for the foreign film lover."
2,WHERE is the FLAVOR ????,Rice noodles have OODLES of flavor when cooked(steamed). Absolutely no flavor at all. Indian grocery stores carry better noodles that soak in boiled water for 10 minutes. Or you can make FRESH ones if you have rice grains.
1,FALSE advertising!,"The description for this product on Amazon website states:""They're made right here in the U.S. from American white rice flour"" but when I got them today it said ""MADE IN THAILAND"" Are you kidding me?"
1,Beyond Taste,"All-natural, no MSG, no preservatives, wheat-free, gluten-free, fat-free which means not muchSo I fired them an email and asked if that product was GMO.I let you guess absolutely no response...that says a lot to me!If you have any ties with that company abstain to post comments as it becomes routinethat employees are sent to post idiotic comments.Maybe the company PR would like to make a statement here?I'll be more than glad to hear that this product has absolutely no genetically modified organismsFor the ones who do not know what GMO ishere is a quick definitionGMO stands for Genetically Modified Organisms, which refers to any food product that has been altered at the gene level (also described as ""genetically engineered"" GE or ""genetically manipulated"" (GM))."
5,Canciones Elegidas lo mejor de Cerati...,"Gustavo Cerati has had one of the most succesful solo careers in the Latin Rock/Pop world. One of the greatest musicians out of Argentina, always innovative with his unique voice and guitar style and eager to explore the world of electronica and mix it beautifully with everything from Pop to Classical music (Buy Bocanada, a masterpiece)... He was the leader of SODA STEREO, an amazing band that surfaced in the early 80's in South America. This compilation is a must have for all of those fans and music lovers all around."
5,A Cerati Fan's MUST HAVE,"This CD and DVD combo is a fabulous collection of Cerati's best solo pieces plus a few great new cuts as well. Beautiful, unique and perfect. What more can I say?"
2,Esperaba mas de un maestro!,"siempre he sido un gran fan de GUSTAVO CERATI lo he visto tocar en vivo y no le pide nada a los mejores djs del mundo sin embargo ahora que compre esta coleccion de sus CANCIONES ELEJIDAS pienso que relamente no eligio bien ya que nisiquiera puso en el cd mi cancion favorita TE LLEVO PARA QUE ME LLEVES,lo unico que salva a esta coleccion es el DVD que este si contiene toda su corta videografia en solitario y es excelente !"
3,hmmmmmmmm,"por ser cerati le doy 3, pero mala seleccionseleccion erronea pero el contenido en cuanto a calidad es bueno"
1,ABSOLUTELY AWFUL,"DONT UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THESE CRAPPY ""FAN FAVORITES"", COMING OUT. WHOEVER CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA IS A COMPLETE IDIOT. AND I HOPE SONY HASN'T MADE MANY COPIES OF THESE, BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SELL. IF THEY WERE SMART, THEY'D CONTINUE SELLING THE SEASON SETS."
1,where are the rest,forget this crap where are the rest of the series. by the time they release them ill have a beard down to the floor. we all been waiting a long time and now its time to release them. all we have is three more to go so whats the problem. every series that i buy is always complete so far except this one. so get on the ball and lets do it. thank you
2,"COPIES OF 7,8 & 9 AVAIL AT IOFFER.COM","I HAVE PURCHASED COPIES OF SEASONS 7,8 & 9 ON [...] FOR $24.99THEY COME IN BOX WITH ARTWORK WITH EACH DISK IN PLASTIC SLEEVE.QUALITY IF EXCELLENT, NO COMMERICAL INTERRUPTIONS. SELLER IS PRIORITY1964"
1,"What is this Bologna! WE WANT SEASONS 7, 8 & 9","Die hard fans of All In The Family don't want a Fan Favorites collection of episodes that are already out. We want to have Seasons 7 - 9 released, PLEASE! NOW! GET THE PICTURE SONY?I say if someone wants AITF, they should buy all 6 seasons that are available right now instead of buying this stupid, pointless release.Are you All In The Family fans with me on this? I'm just absolutely tired of TV shows that have some or most of its season releases put out on DVD only to have the rest of it's season releases put on hiatus leaving the die hards fans hanging and wondering if there ever going to be released. REMEMBER, it's been since February 2007 since Season #6 was released. That a little over 2 1/2 years.If want to know more about what I have to say about All In The Family, I wrote a review for Season 7 titled, ""MY FAVORITE HALF HOUR SHOW, WHAT'S THE HOLDUP?"" Check it out!"
1,Fan Favorites are a Joke,"I love the Jeffesons, All in the Family, Maude, the Facts of Life, etc. I am so disappointed that they just stop. To insult us and take aim at our wallets they come out with fan favorites. Release the rest already. It seems like they are trying to pull our strings. Notice how the things people really want seem like they take forever, but then you have these newer shows like Charmed, House,etc. that drop one after another. Put the good stuff out from the 70's and 80's. No matter how old or young you are, it seems like everyone loves the 80's. I have seen clubs with nothing but 21-24 year olds loving the 80's music. Saturday nights in some cities have radio stations that play nothing but 80's. These studios can't make me believe that shows from those eras are not selling. Come on. Give me a break, speaking of which, drop some more seasons of those too. I really liked the show as the girls got older."
1,Jeffersons retread,It's been 2 years since season 6 release and what do we get? Favorite episodes from season 2!!!C'mon release the seasons 7 thru 11 and stop stalling.
1,WHERE ARE SEASON'S 7 - 11?,"We waited over 2 years for Season 7 of The Jeffersons to come out on DVD and now this favorites release is just a reminder of how long us fans have waited and are going to continue to wait. How much longer is the wait going to be? I'm getting sick of this.SONY, Please get your act together and start putting out the season sets again instead of a FAN FAVORITES DVD.I like all the characters on the show, but my favorites are George, Florence the maid, and Mother Jefferson in the early episodes.If I find Season 7 is ever in the works with a release date in the future, I'd even be willing to pre-order it, that's how bad I want it."
1,Shame on them!,I haven't bought this 'Fan Favorites' set and of course I won't! I just felt I couldn't help joining the many previous reviewers and fans of this unforgettable show who cried out shame on Sony Pictures for issuing this instead of releasing the 5 seasons left of it already! That's unbelievable. In the past months I even got to believe that the very sad news of Sherman Hemsley's untimely passing away could bring us something and this is what we get?!?
1,BEWARE - - - NOT AS DESCRIBED,"On the front of the case it says: ""Contains the episode that introduces Maude."" it doesn't.On the back of the case it says: Includes these eight hilarious episodes:"" nope, only four.For the same price you can buy the complete second season, 24 episodes, on three discs."
3,Provocative questions left unanswered in Seymore's book.,"Those interested in the subject of Morrison's death owe a great deal of gratitude to Seymore, whose dogged perseverence resulted in the release of several major documents held by Paris police, including the report of Alain Ronay, the full police report of Pam Courson, et cetera. Nevertheless, Seymore fails to follow up on some fascinating issues, and largely believes the Courson /Ronay story without questioning the underlying validity of those testimonies or looking very deeply into the situation. Much of the book could be subtitled, ""Bob's Irritations With Parisian Bureaucracy,"" and it often seems as if Seymore is desperately trying to pad what is already a short book. He fails to read his own material very closely for places where witness testimony is provocatively contradictory, primarily (I believe) because his main thrust in doing research into Morrison's death was to discover that he was still alive. Sorry, Mr. Seymore..."
1,not good,"did'n like it at all. i read the book and is extremely good, but its the worst movie ever. just read the book even other characters appear"
5,Best shorts I've had in LONG time!,"I purchased these shorts locally (and later through Amazon) because of the fit. I'm petite and usually the rise is too high--these sit below the waist, have a little stretch, they're modest (middle of the knee for me) and crisp. They wash well and dry quickly. I wear these 6 days a week (uniform), and these are wonderfully comfortable. The price is great too. I ordered a similar pair from another company (signature brand) and when I got them they were too small, but made almost identical to the Dickies. They were $48, so I returned them and bought 2 more pairs of Dickies. The Dickies are definitely worth every bit of their price."
2,Shorter than expected,"The images show this short hitting just above the knee, the product that arrived was significantly shorter however, and needed to be returned."
3,An excellent primer,"This video, while not as flashy as some of the others out there, contains excellent information and actually *teaches* something. I have gotten a great deal out of this video and plan to purchase another for a gift."
1,The quality of tape is poor--tracking is not correctable,"Lilias presents a very basic yoga workout (1/2 hour) for beginners, which has an easy to follow format and is understandable. The tape quality makes it difficult to ""enjoy"" the exercises. (I cannot tolerate silver lines anywhere on the screen). I am sorry I purchased this tape."
5,Oustanding for the Baby Boomers,"This is the Baby Boomers version of Bolles What Color is my Parachutte. A must read for all career changers, those downsized and all others interested in career progression and growth. Kudos to the authors on this timely and fabulous book for the Boomers.Jim Link"
5,very cool,"Easily tossed around the house, into bowls or to each other. Very fun and inspiring patterns...Not sure about 'stacking' them, (not sure if the 3 yr old i have in the house will do that with these & maybe I'm not creative but I couldnt stack 'em to make characters) but who cares. they are really unique and so far the kiddos Ive had in my home are drawn to 'em. My 10 mo. old likes to touch them too. They are a little pricey, but when I looked at Etsy for bean bags they were a greater value. Plus, Im banking on the longevity of this item. They can be used for anything with a little imagination! They can be easily stored & grab one or two to make a great travel toy."
3,Fun to Look at and Hold!,"These little guys rate five stars for being adorable. But I'm not sure how much they retain the interest for kids. I gave a set to my grandkids - almost 2yo, and 5yo. The 5yo stacked them for a few minutes, then went off to play with other things (puzzles, etc.). The 2yo played with them for a few minutes, and also went off to do other things. I am not with my grandkids alot, so they may have found other things to do with the Beanstax since I saw them. Maybe the adults can help them find other things to do with them. I wouldn't buy them again. Pretty expensive, and I would rather spend the money on books for the kids."
2,Disappointing,"Not sure how this one ended up on my gotta-read-it list. I only made it halfway through before realizing I was avoiding picking up where I left off in this book. While the author did create some interesting characters, oftentimes their actions or thoughts or dialogue were implausible and hard to swallow that someone would actually do or think or say such a thing. Also, there were many times I had to re-read a paragraph again to to glean ""WHO said this?"" or ""WHAT is s/he talking about?"" From an English perspective, misplaced modifiers and shifting POV made for choppy reading experience. Glimpses of a good author here, though sometimes waaay off the mark. The characters themselves, the story (what there is of it), and the writing were all too off-putting for me to finish this book."
1,The Worst Southern Novel Award,"Since this was McCorkle's fifth (long-awaited) novel, I was anticipating it greatly. But I found the plot too much like Lee Smith's FAMILY LINEN. Surely after five or six novels an author gets better, right? There's more to fiction than characters talking non-stop. There's got to be more than slapstick comedy. Like many North Carolina authors, Jill is the darling. Can't do any wrong. But readers will be the final judge.And she is NOT the ""new"" Eudora Welty. If anyone in the south deserves that title, it's Lee Smith, the grand dame of literature."
1,Waste of Time,I love Myrtle Beach and all of the South and was very excited to read a Southern author. What a huge disappointment! I'm curious how this is a National Bestseller as advertised.
1,PetShield Bucket Seat - Horrible Item,"The travel barrier is cheap and does not cover the area between the bucket seats as indicated in the description. The distance between the unit and the headrest leaves a gap and my dog can get through it (60 pound lab). The screw that is used to tighten the unit when expanded is worthless, when lightly tightened - it stripped out. Also when tightened between the floor and the roof, my dog can lightly tap it and move it out of the way."
1,Extremely disappointing,"I found this book to be very short on any kind of meat or details. I'm very tempted to ask for my money back. There is no insight here - the book could have been compiled from a series of press releases. I think the standard of the book is typified by the 'bibliography' which seems to list every single article the author has ever written, including in magazines like Computer Shopper a decade ago. How that is supposed to be any help to anybody I cannot see. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,To each his own,"Like Linthicums previous books, this is surely not for someone who wants to get technical folks, its for the business people. As such, if you are a technical person and occasionally need to advice the management or help them understand technical issues, this book might help to understand their framework.If you see it on your bosses or customers bookshelf, at least skim through it in the local bookstore. Otherwise, if unlucky, you might be forced to look at the pictures anyhow in the next management meeting shown in power point titled ""Road Map"" without a good counter-argument prepared."
3,Good book needs better editor..,"I've read this book making notes. I was new to Application Integration but now have a firm grip on the subject. I did need to put my notes in a more comprehensive order though, the book is jumping back and forth and doesn't have a coherend style of comparing(for instance Synchronous versus asynchronous is compared, Direct communication is separated from Queued communication though etc.) maybe there wasn't an editor firmiliar with the subject.This book definitaly needs an update, it looks like it's predictions are coming true at last. Now there's a chance for re-editing at the same time, this book deserves it!"
1,A very bad book,"This is an entirely useless book. If you think you will understand what Web Services are from reading this book, I can assure you that you will not.On the other hand if you ""think"" that you have understood Web Services or Application Integration for that matter, from reading this book, I can assure you that you have no idea what you are talking about because neither does the Author.Everything that this book wants to convey, it can be put in no more than 10 pages of a white paper."
5,EAI+Web Services = This Book,"I've read the author's other books and found them very valuable, and this book is no different. This book does a great job in explaining how Web services fits into the world of EAI. I really liked the way the author approaches the topic, using practical applications and examples, where to use Web services, and where not to use Web services. Good information beyond the hype.However, this is not just a Web services book. You'll find most of the information you'll need to run an EAI project (don?t ask me how I know that). The book does not dictate a static solutions, as do other Web service books, but allows you to find the right technology for the needs of your project."
1,Terrible like his other books,"Someone please tell Linthicum that he cannot write. Repetitive, vague, did I say repetitive. The figures are terrible.Very simle and elementary. A waste of money"
4,Works well,My daughter has been using this for about a month now to lug her high school textbooks back and forth. She mostly rolls it behind her with the long handle.This is another high quality Jansport backpack and it is standing up to daily abuse very well.I cannot judge how comfortable it is to wear since that is not how we use it.
2,disappointed with Jansport,"We purchased this Jansport wheeled backpack for our daughter to sue for school and travel, choosing Jansport because of its reputation for good products. However, we immediately noticed that there was some difficulty with the handle, specifically that it was difficult to make it go all the way back down, requiring seveal attempts each time with a force that could damage it. The second problem is that on the first trip, essentially the first time it was used, we noticed a tear in the material along the bottom of the pack. The material should be stronger, especially with the abuse such a product will get through use by kids."
2,"Beautiful bag, but the wheels stick","These bags are great. Their only problem is that the wheels get slightly bent and then they don't role well. It is incredibly annoying. The first bag this happened to I returned. The second I just kept it. It drags and the wheels turn a little, but it's not smooth and it's not easy.The fabric is beautiful and the choices are overwhelming -- please, please UPGRADE THE WHEELS!!!!"
3,color misleading,"I was expecting a lavender/fuschia/black plaid fabric, instead it was gray and black plaid with pink highlights. I would also classify this as a wheeled carry on piece of luggage, instead of a daypack, even though the straps can be fastened into place so you can carry it like a backpack. It's a bit cumbersome for everday use, but my elementary school student is using it with no complaints so far. One teacher commented that my student user looks like she's ready to board a plane."
3,Sent it back,"I liked the backpack overall, but it had handle issues and had to go back. No problem returning for refund."
4,expensive but good,"expensive but good as expected,durable,bought it for my 6 grader so she does not break her back no problems, amazon was cheepest , 2 thumbs 4 star$$$$"
3,a little disappointed in an otherwise very nice backpack,"I ordered this backpack per my daughter's request. The backpack is roomy and durable looking and the handle does extend to a plenty long enough length for an adult, however, customers need to be aware that THE HANDLE WILL NOT COLLAPSE COMPLETELY INTO THE BAG when the release button is pushed. The photo is a true representation when it shows the handle extending above the backpack. If you unzip the interior wall zipper you will find two release buttons on the handle slides inside the wall of the pack that will allow the handle to be completely stored inside the pack. I thought there was a defect in the product when we received it and so reported it and sent it back for an exchange. The replacement arrived in @ two days but it opperates exactly the same way, so I suppose it is a glitch in the design. Other than that little drawback, the back pack seems to be well made and attractive."
3,needs water bottle pocket on side,I was so focused on looking for something on wheels with plenty of room for text books that I forgot to pay attention to other features. I really wish this had a water bottle pocket on the side. Otherwise it looks roomy enough for a heavy load of text books.
3,NOT WEIGHT AS ADVERTISED,"Well, the issue here, is that, according to this site, the shipping weigth is 2.2 pounds...IT IS NOT!!..The actual shipping weigth is 8 pounds. What a LITTLE MISTAKE!"
3,Purchased but had to return,"I think the biggest problem here is that the item has a very poor description which cause me to buy wrong product. Also, it seems product might have changed as other people's reviews stating to place at least 14"" from tree are incorrect. My product stated to place at least 24"" so these spikes are for rather large palms as their roots dont really spread far as it is. I also believe the spikes did arrive broken as there was a lot of rattling in the package."
3,Manganese/Magnesium???,"I was going to buy these but I see no fertilizer analysis shown. I've been told that soluable Manganese is a critical micronutrient for all palms, especially in sandy, coastal soils."
3,Arrived in Poor condition,"I have used plant stakes in the past for my fruit trees and they work great overall. However when they arrive in pieces as mine did they do not work at all. Whoever packed it, had to have heard the pieces rattle in the box! Yes I could have returned them but that is the problem with buying on line. The other problem with buying online is just after buying them I found them at Lowe's for 5.98. Less than I paid for them. There is nothing wrong with the product just the condition it arrived in."
1,four out of five spikes isn't acceptable,Inner sealed package contained only 4 spikes not the five it listed on the outside. I have ordered this product before and not had this issue.
2,"great piece, but hard to tell from this recording","Eight Songs for a Mad King is a fantastic piece of music theater, but it's not the sort of classical music most people would put on for recreational listening. The piece is probably best appreciated in a live performance.The performance on this recording is spirited, but unfortunately Eastman sings a great many incorrect pitches, rhythms, dynamics, often gets out of sync with the ensemble, and adds lots of silly character voices and random effects where none are called for in the score. A pity."
2,Sellouts,"If you would respond to the fans that made you , then you wouldn't get this bad review . I've seen this band several times , hung out , and even partied with . They sold out , and now only concern themselves with money and fame . What a shame , this used to be a great band ."
3,Interesting but I'd want the Pardey's Storm Tactics DVD too,I found the information on sailing a boat in heavier winds worth seeing. Info on sail construction and choice was good. But when it came to actual handling of the boat when winds were over gale force it seems this video was a bit wishy washy. I think the Storm Tactics DVD the Pardeys put together is much more confidence building. I may be prejudiced because I attended some of their seminars and they understand the problems that face those of us who sail short handed.
3,Worth a look,"This is more or less a technical video and worth a look on that premise. Some of the footage is interesting and the instruction seems solid. The quality is not the best - hard to hear the speaker at times.For what it is, I think it's worth having in your sailing video collection."
1,Another christian book good only for berning,"Normally i'd say don't do it, don't pollute the poor planet's atmosphere with all the smoke this stupid book would make, but Dobson's book is so dumb, i'm thinking it might be woth making the exeption. The constellations are part of the natural world, the way it was laid down the ancients long before these silly tribe of jesus people started staking their claims and mucking it up. The stars are the only thing can help guide us in keeping harmony with all on the planet, the moon and the sun and the natural cycles and all the people to make peace with one another rather than fighting that goes on and on because of greed and these silly ideas. To have these people try to scratch their stupid notions across the sacred skies is about all i can stomach. It's an insult to any one with any insight into the deeper workings of the world and harmony of the planets. May the gods give you a tummy ache, Mr. Dobson."
4,A helpful learning experience,"These ""World of"" albums from Zyx are normally very good. They deliver a lot of good music for the money, and they make wise choices about dance tempos and orchestras. This collection is NOT as good as most of ""World of"" discs.There are some great orchestras here, and this gives the collection its 4 star value. The less than great orchestras will be easily identified, and you can avoid them in the future.Every track on the first disc deserves 3.5-4 stars. Several of the tracks on the second disc rate only three stars or less (5-12, 13). Too bad I can't rate this 3.5 stars. . ."
4,Tough as nails,"I was surprised to read Mickey Spillane's obituary in The Economist recently because I had thought that he must have died years ago. I had seen the Mike Hammer TV series, but had never read any of Spillane's books. I decided to dive in by reading the three novels in this collection. I was glad I did. Although the writing is hardly great literature, and Hammer is more a juvenile comic book fantasy than a well-developed sympathetic character, I could barely put the book down until I had finished all three of the novels. Quite simply, Spillane is a hell of a story teller. If you are also unacquainted with Mickey Spillane, reading this book will be well worth your time."
5,3 OF MICKEY SPILLIANE'S BEST NOVELS,"These 3 books are just awsome! , I'D Pick Up Each One And Just Could Not Put It Down! , If Your A Mike Hammer Fan , You Don't Want To Miss This Collection ! . I Highly Recommend This Download ! William Croce"
5,WOW,"This is so freakin' good. Spillaine is the Master at crime-fiction. And controlling your fingers to turn page after page. Even if you're not so much a fan of reading books, just pick this up.It is great."
3,tiny print,"Like Spillane, although some of his expressions, words are now dated. Most disappointed in the size of print. Way too small."
4,Very Laid Back,Jim Morris is and exceptional singer/writer. He takes you to a place where you just want to relax. I have five of his cd's and have not been dissapointed yet. Freaky Tiki Faces is very original and humorous.
2,Too brief to be very useful,"This video has some useful information, but it's so short for the amount of material attempted to be covered that the amount of useful information is very limited. It's approximately like trying to give a day-long boating safety class in one hour. Most of information needs to be left out and only a few highlights can be presented. The highlights may almost be enough to get by, but they're definitely very far from a complete education.I find the Coast Guard Auxillary'sBoating Skills and Seamanship, 13th Editionbook to be vastly superior, and at a significantly lower cost.On the other hand, simple advice which is mentioned in the video such as not anchoring at the transom could have saved the lives of those football players in Florida, so even the basic information in this video could be useful if widely disseminated and heeded."
4,Too big to put in a purse,"It is a nice looking leather wallet but too big to hold it in a small purse that I usually carry.Since I can put my passport in it, this wallet will be used when I travel overseas."
5,READ BLACK PEOPLE,Very interesting book = the author kept my attention throughout the whole book I even had to laugh at the way he writes to his audience. This book is a must read for African Americans you will look at things differently and learn alot about this world that we live in. Don't be blind make sure you add this to your book list.
4,Another Bitter Pill To Swallow Toward Healing Us!,"Brother Akil posits what those who have some semblance of a clue in the BLAK nation know, as to who is responsible for the BLAK nation's condition. Using the theology of Master Fard Muhammad(GOD in person), and his messenger, Elijah Muhammad, Akil codifies the healing message that BLAK peole need. To those persons who attempt to discredit this work as racists, blaming white peole for the BLAK nation's condition, and or trying to belittle Akil's work, I ask you the question; Is what Akil says true or not? If it isn't true, then disprove what he says scientifically or be quiet in your rage and hypocrisy; it's gotten very old. To WE the original people of the earth, this is good medicine in helping to facilitate our healing and repairing the damage that our 6,000 year old enemy has done to us."
1,Derogatory word,"Well the book is alright I guess since it is trying to inspire confidence in oneself(that's why I gave it the one star), but there's one problem with it, he's trying to build are confidence while at the same time calling us ignorant by using the n-word, which whites use to call us beast, ugly and dumb."
4,This book is a good read if you don't take all of it seriously,"First let me say I'm not black. Just one of the whitest Puerto Ricans around. At first I thought Akil's in your face, blunt style of writing was funny and entertaining. Then as I got to reading the book more I found that he had some good points intellectualization instead of memorization. What I didn't like about the book was when he said you don't need college. You can just open up a book and read it and study and you'll understand it. Well this man has obviously never tried to that with a Calculus book. Also I did not like the end where he confirms my suspicions and starts touting the Nation of Islam and praising Elijah Muhammad. He didn't need to do that. He was doing just fine on his own. Still I would recommend this book if you have a thick skin and racist statements don't bother you."
4,"Healing , Meditative Sounds","Good relaxing music. Excellent in the chapel, workplace and while driving to soothe the soul"
2,Look elsewhere,"Each chapter of this book clearly and simply introduces one aspect of middle school mathematics. Following each introduction are a set of problems aimed at three progressively difficult skill levels. There is an answer sheet at the back of the book.Unfortunately, what's missing from this book is the essence of any math course: showing your work. Consequently, you will find no guidance or strategy(ies) for solving the problems. Moreover, if you have the wherewithall to solve the more difficult problems, you probably aren't going to find very useful the abecedarian introductions the author provides.These points, taken in conjuction with the amateurish, mouse-drawn computer graphics, make this one disappointing book."
2,Challenge math?,"I don't think it should be called challenge math. Many of the problems can be found in the text book. There are many cartoon pictures that are intended to make the book more interesting, but I don't personally like them - others may like it. I have already returned it."
4,Cute Toy,"The product is pretty cool, its hard to open the back to replace batteries though. I thought that the batteries ran out very quickly, esp. since I haven't even had it turned on that often. Now I just take the back part out when I am not using it so I know for sure the batteries aren't being used up."
4,Very Good,My daughter loved this toy and I was happy to see her have so much fun with it. It even hisses at you which I thought was very funny and inventive.
3,Cute,I thought this item was very cute for what it was and it operated as described. Grandson loved it.
2,Didn't work that well,"Although my son enjoyed this toy in the hour after he opened it, he has hardly played with it since. Plugged into the MP3 player, it wasn't loud enough to hear. With a CD player, we could hear it, but the sound was terrible. It is a cute idea, but not well executed."
2,Yucky!,"Yes, unlike I dog this is still working but doesn't do much, sound is too soft to hear as speaker but does purr so we know its working!"
4,GREAT!,"So CUTE!! It works great. The speakers are a bit low, but it still works for work and for my younger siblings."
4,Lovely New Lehar Piece,"What a lovely surprise for Christmas time -- a newly recorded opera by Lehar, full of lush orchestrations, melodies and a strong cast of artists. Listeners are probably not familiar with this opera, very early in Lehar's career. It is serious -- set in Russia with a finale in the Siberian snow where the lovers perish in the snow (yes, a bit like the finale of Puccini's Manon Lescaut). I recommend this well-done recording for Lehar fans -- it is enchanting."
2,Not Worth A Pluck,"Bought this to help a home made chicken plucker which had a slipping V belt. Sprayed it on, fired up the plucker and dropped in a chicken. The plucker spun, shuddered, pulled off a few feathers, and then stalled, almost as quickly as before. Had to repeat the process too many times before the bird was free of feathers.Perhaps Permatex makes an industrial strength version of their belt dressing that would work. This product does not!Easy John"
1,This article is a joke,"This article is a joke.It provides common sense suggestions and is totally not worth the $10 Amazon charges. Just four pages of waste. I am very upset I bought it.Whach out and avoid my same mistake, don't buy it."
4,Lovely Purple Color,"Soft, easy to install and the color is a rich purple. I bought these from Amazon with free shipping for $6 a piece. Now, I see they no longer carry them. Amazon often has seatcovers on sale from $5 to $8 each. It depends on how much you want to spend. I have these less than a year and there are already holes in them. I average a pair every year."
1,Not really a cover up,"These ""cover ups"" are very thin, a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun. The colors are pretty, but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps. They are cheap, good thing because I can't imagine what to use them for. I'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item."
5,Talk about fun!,"This is a grat game to add that extra something to your sex life! I bought this a few years ago & have had a great time trying the creative ""cards"" included. We've never been able to get passed the 2nd level because it's just that seductive! My girlfriend has been looking for it for a while, but I surprised her on her birthday with this game. When her husband got back from the war, was he in for a surprise! I haven't heard from her in a couple of days..."
1,0 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If there were an option for o stars i would choose it. Firstof all why is a grown-up giving reviews on Pokemon videos? Second of all im a kid. i had to watch this crap for three hours with my cousin justin. i nearly went over and smashed the movie. Ash has lightning bolts under his eyes. MIsty is messed up to put it nicely and can Brock even see? over all this is probably the worst dvd on the planet, if you like this you need to spend a little ime in your local asylum, never watch this, i would pay some one to keep this DVD at least 10, 000 miles away from me at all times, never even think about buying this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Cool!,"Dude this kicks! Really fast and loud, dissonant. I've never heard piano sound like this. And its really cheap too. WOW!BUT THERE IS NO UNDERSTANDING OF THE MUSIC. THESE WERE ALL GREAT COMPOSERS, AND THIS PIANIST TREATS THEM LIKE PEOPLE WHO JUST WROTE LOTS OF NOTES THAT WERE HARD TO PLAY. BUY POLLINI OR ASHKENAZY INSTEAD. THIS IS COOL BUT NOT WORTH TEH $7!"
4,Costuming ideas,"I got this while on a committee for costuming a production of ""A Christmas Carol"". While not showing enough variety and detail to be a huge amount of help, it was useful as one piece of our research in the ""feel"" we wanted to create for our production. Since we were on a very tight budget and were trying to use borrowed, found, and second-hand resources, this was an important part of our research."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Do not buy this game!!!! All that is contained is a regular deck of cards, instructions, and 4 very, very lame ""bidding"" wheels. The bidding wheels do not even assemble correctly. This is an expensive deck of cards folks. Just use a regular set of cards and look up the instructions online. Lame-O. I only gave this 1 star because there was not a 0 star rating."
3,"Like it, but...","This faucet looks beautiful in our remodeled kitchen, but I likely wouldn't buy it again - here's why:1) Because of the way our pipes are aligned under the sink, the pull-out hose weight needs to be in a position which makes the hose rather short or else the weight will get hung up on the pipes and not allow the faucet head to fully retract.2) Regular use and movement of the pull out faucet causes the faucet head to loosen over time, and has to be re-tightened by occasionally - not a big deal, but have had a few little water unwanted water sprays from the loose connection.I have seen an ad (Delta, maybe?) for a similar-looking faucet that that has a magnetized faucet head to make sure the pull-out faucet retracts securely back in place. I would look for that feature if I had to buy a faucet all over again."
4,Looks good,"It's my second faucet for project because the new all-in- one kind lever didn't clear my back wall, (Moen Brantford) so I had to find one with a separate lever like this one. Had to have another hole drilled at more cost. So plan ahead. Can't comment on function. Hope it doesn't leak and spray snuggly retracts"
1,Sorry Tony,Standup ain't your forte.Maybe if you'd done more stories & outtakes from 'Blackadder' this vid would be worth it but 80% of what you do is cuss & you just ain't funny.Stick to comedic roles.Save your money for the Blackadder collection.
2,Stewart Copeland wipes out with Rapa Nui,"Stewart Copeland is indeed involved with this release. In the CD liner notes it lists: Music composed by Stewart Copeland. Music performed by Stewart Copeland, Judd Miller, Ron Aston and Jonathon Sheffer. Unfortunately, this is definately not Stewart's best work- far from it. The album is filled with native instruments and vocals galore. Sounds exciting, but detached from the film, the music is noisy and boring. Stewart can and has done much better. Check out ""The Leapord Son"" for Stewart at his best."
1,Where is Stewart Copeland?,"Stewart Copeland was listed as being associated with this CD. From what I can tell by listening, the only association is what Amazon.com has listed. There is no reference made on the information provided and no influence in the music. The music is a repetative theme of Island songs, and I mean repetative."
4,Gillian Welch Fan,"If you are a fan of Gillian Welch,you will enjoy this dvd,it is folk music at its best."
2,Would not buy again.,This video is bla. I think they are great performers but nothing exciting here. I skipped many of the songs and only ended up watch 2 that i knew well. Would not buy this video again.
5,beyond my expectations,I first became aware of Gillian and David on the DVD'DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAIN'. The REVELATOR COLLECTION is a must have if you like these two great musicians. I only wish they would do more in DVD.
5,another excellent revival,"Blessings on Rue Morgue for their revival of Dorothy Bowers! This is another fine story, beautifully written, atmospheric and neatly puzzling. It's a great pity that Bowers died so young, but at least we have these few treats from her pen now available again."
5,Wish I Had It When We Bought Our House,"I have been scanning it and love the print size and short, concise and easy to understand definitions. This is a perfect tool for anyone buying a house. I wish I would have had it when we bought our house and when we refinanced."
3,Not what I expected.,"I was hoping that I could add life to my ever tightening jeans with these but, they aren't made to hold up unbuttoned pants. They do cover up the unbuttoned and unzipped stuff but, I had to jerryrig a way to still hold them up. I would say, save your money and just buy maternity pants.If you just bought them to cover your belly when your shirts get a bit short then get them but, they are not what I was looking for.Good quality though."
5,Great Product,"This product is great when you are not showing yet, but your jeans and pants are getting tight. It looks like a tanktop hanging out and it is very comfortable! Would reccommend to any pregnant lady!"
5,Belly Band,"I have found that the baby be mine maternity belly bands are very handy to have. I was getting to the point where I needed maternity pants, unfortunately money was tight and I could not afford any. I seen these tried them and they saved me time and money! I really recommend!"
3,Not as secure as i'd have liked,"I picked the smallest size and since i was a size 6 before my pregnancy (the higher end of the size 1), i expected it to be nice and snug. It really wasnt. I tried folding in half and using the folded edge at the bottom and that helped a little but it just didnt work for me for what i had intended for it."
4,Just as described,The items were just as described. I received them quickly. I use them daily so I made a great purchase at a great price.
2,all right,"Does not adequately cover the unbuttoned pants. When you wear this with your unbuttoned pants, you can see through it. It does not work. However, the length is nice and long, so that you could wear other tops that are too short, but don't leave pants undone."
3,Not great for plus-sizes,"I purchased these when I was pregnant- in a size 4 (my pre-preg size was 20). I didn't use them very often, because they were constantly riding up or down, and didn't do a very good job of keeping my pants up. Every time I got up from a seated position I had to readjust everything. I don't know if it's because I'm plus-sized or what, but I didn't get very much use out of them."
2,Great Product but Bad Seller,"I bought the 3 pack back in January 2010 and originally did not receive it. I emailed the seller and they stated that they would ship it out again. When I finally received the product I only received 2 out of the 3 for this order. I received the black and white belly bands. They work very well.However, I contacted the seller numerous times for either getting a credit for the difference between the 2 pack and 3 pack or for them to send me the nude one. I never received any replies or credit back from them. They do not have very good customer service and I will not purchase anything else from them in the future."
5,Perfect baby patterns,I had a copy of this book years ago when my children were babies and I lost it. So I had to have another copy for the grands! The patterns are all simple and practical. Directions are very clear and easy to follow. Patterns are included but you will need tracing paper to copy them as they are printed front and back of the paper so you can't cut them out. They are multi sized for babies.
3,What is that smell?,I bought this book in the first trimester and the adhesives and inks used to put it together are overwhelmingly stinky. I haven't been able to look at the book w/out a headache within about 10 minutes. I am reading the great reviews but very put off by the noxious smell (even now in 3rd trimester). Any ideas on airing out this smelly book? Or am I the only person who noticed it?
3,"Good, but not as good as other brands","I got this one for first time as an alternative to other brands the same juice. Watered down per my estimation, not as XanGo Mangosteen Juice I used to buy. Sorry, I am not switching to this one. On positive side I tied other products of the same company - Acai Juice Blend Dynamic Health, at it was outstanding, will buy again."
1,Mangosteen,They send me produt mangosteen gold was expire date 5-01-0-2012 lot #686377 so i did a claim they not care about people
1,mangosteen juice,I tried 3 differant brands of this juice because they imply that you would get relief from arthritis pain. Save your money and buy tylenol. all of these brands are at best bland tasting and did nothing at all for pain.
2,Running Slow,"There is always a delay by 20-30 minutes per day, starting from the day I received this watch. It did not appear as good as it looked in the image."
5,Cool watch for a cool price,"Its amazing to have a tommy watch for such a cheaper price.The watch looks grt,has very nice looks and is good as a gift for someone whom you love......one must be lucky enough to have this watch gifted"
5,What a gift!,"This CD evoked many emotions with me due to Robert's intriguing voice and intersting lyrics. I've experienced some challenges in my lifetime and I found this CD very thought provoking and of course, VERY ENJOYABLE! I wish you much happiness and joy in your life, Robert!"
5,Moving...Captivating,"I've had this cd for a couple of years, and I never get tired of it. I love RDJ's voice. I first took notice when he sang on Ally McBeal, and I bought a soundtrack for that show just to hear more of him.I love the song ""Broken."" I find that I can get lost in his music. If you love poetry, you'll love his lyrics because that's what they are. I hope he has another cd soon."
2,"Its OK, I Suppose","I can't fault Robert Downey Jr.'s talent, but what I can't understand is why he continually uses what seem to be unusual gifts to create such mediocre products. And now he has expanded into the recording arena, with an album of songs too maudlin for Sting (middle-aged Sting, that is).This album is truly mediocre. Nobody would listen to it if he wasn't already famous.But all the middle-aged, co-dependent women who go goo-goo for everything Robert Downey does will undoubtedly be completely satisfied with this product. Go for it, ladies!"
1,"Oh, dear","I, too, cannot imagine who would give this weird effort 5 stars (or 4, 3, 2 or 1); I gave it one star because zero is not an option, but also because I'm sympathetic toward the actor/vocalist. Maybe another half-star would be in order because of its laugh-inducing, anti-depressant effect. Robert's ""singing"" is so self-conscious, mannered, and just plain awful, it's hard to believe the whole project isn't a joke. What was Sony Classical thinking? Did they just sign Robert Downey Jr. based on his notoriety? What did the people in the studio think when they witnessed this recording in-process? What does Robert's wife and friends tell him about his ""music""???There is a heartfelt, poetic core to Robert's lyrics. However any potential toward acceptablity is obliterated by the train-wreck musical arrangements, and by Robert's agonizing, cartoonish voice technique.Buy this CD only as a gag gift, or if you sometimes think you're a terrible singer/musician and want to hear someone who's worse."
1,never enough...,"before you ask why i rated this album so low, being that robert downey jr. is the most handsome man alive as well as a musical genuis, he could quite possibly be the Mozart or Bach of his time...with that said i feel like there just isn't enough RDJ on this album...why only 12 songs, he should make a double cd, or maybe a triple cd set...i would pay good money for that, with an extra cd for special interviews into the life of times of R. Downey jr...but i love him, he's the man, i wish music these days was more like his, refreshing, stimulating, innovative and just damn sexy...i know one anniversaries me and my lady will get some champagne, light the fireplace, lay on the bear skin rug and listen to RDJ by candle light...he's the best and in my heart a 5 star person/actor/musician...perfect stocking stuffer for the upcoming holidays...i know i'm buying a few for all of my family and loved ones...keep up the good work futurist...you are definetly ahead of ur time...."
1,Dont waste your money,"The other day I was in my girlfriends moms car, when her mom put in the new robert downey jr cd. It was a very ackward ride none the less. After about 10 minutes I couldnt take it anymore, I told her mom to drop me off at the corner and I would take the bus. Dont waste your money on this cd unless you live in a retirement community in florida, or your friends with my girlfriends mom."
2,Eh...,"Not the worst attempted crossover I've ever heard, but not worth paying for. Buy Ironman instead. It sounds like all the worst parts of Paul Simon's recent work, which is actually a bit of a compliment. Downey can clearly sing, and he doesn't suck at piano and keyboards. The problem is: he can't write music, or whoever wrote the songs for him can't. I dig the album art though, maybe he should get into graphic design if he needs a job."
2,Wow,"Horrible. He did a good rendition of ""River"" at some point in his life that I loved, but, this... this is just rubbish. He sounds like he's trying to do some country twang in some of these songs... why?? Uggh."
4,"New, Refreshing","As soon as I heard him sing ""Man Like Me"" on Jay Leno, I put the CD on my Christmas list. I had no idea he could sing! I love him as an actor too so I figured I would support him on his CD too, glad I did it is differnet and refreshing.I am glad I got this CD-"
5,OMG Just Incredible,"I have always love Robert Downey Jr., he is talented, funny, handsome, etc. But I never new he could sing and play piano. I found this CD by chance and I listened to some of the songs and figured I would try it. Well my husband and I cannot stop listening to it, and now everyone loves it. Robert Downey Jr. wrote all of the songs expect Your Move (written and sung by Yes) and Smile (written by Charles Chaplin). Just Incredible. ""Your Move"" is just wonderful. But my favorite song is Man Like Me. Just awesome."
5,The Futurist is refreshing and personal . . .,"Robert Downey Jr. has somethng to be proud of here. Rather than disect the man's music and emotion carried bare and honest but with rich musicianship on these tracks - listen with an open mind. His simple lyrics and strong and gravel sprinkled vocals are refreshingly original. I love this CD and will recommend it to friends. I understand this guy through his music now more than through his acting - maybe relating on a personal level with a son of my own, who is now clean and sober 7 years. I celebrate Mr. Downey's triumph and a fine collection of music - and the cover tunes fitly chosen. ""Broken"" and ""Details"" are intimate and musicially excellent. His cover of ""Smile"" was deliciously raspy and emotive - a good finish to a fine work.Give this to a friend who feels things deeply or needs to."
4,Robert DJ - The Futurist,"I was particularly surprised when I listened to this album. Robert DJ has established himself as a great jazz/soul singer with some very laid back rhythms and ballads. A real surprise package. This is quite good for chilling out, relaxing after work or just to have some music playing while you're working. My favourite song is 5:30, it really strikes a chord with me. Perhaps the offbeat style and clever harmony is intoxicating and makes for a great signature tune. I look forward to hearing more from Robert DJ and if the songs are as good as this album, the next album will be great success.I've also seen quite a few of Robert DJ's clips singing songs from this album and he obviously has a lot of fun recording in the studio!Record some more Robert!"
3,"Good, but not the best.","I bought this album with high expectations but alas, it did not meet them. It's not bad, but not what I expected. RDJ is still the man though!"
2,i really wanted to like this CD,"its just not good. i applaud the effort but we'll be pawning this off on someone else. i find it to me a cheap half Corey Hart, half Eddie Veder imitation. the music is nice, too bad robbie keeps interrupting it with his singing."
2,RDJ takes my breath away,"OK I am a HUGE fan of RDJ, he is so handsome, brooding and sexy but I honestly was shocked to hear him sing. It sucked the breath from me as I gasped for air, thinking, ""Babe! Stop! Please don't sing!"" OK sing in the shower, sing at home or privately, but stick with acting. Seriously that's his best creative output!"
2,"Love the man, tolerate the music","Robert Downey Jr is one of the most interesting and creative actors of our day. His music reflects his angst but is repetitive and utlimately dreary. Perhaps if he had released any one of these songs, he would be heard, but the bunch doesn't keep your attention. I hope to see him acting again, not singing."
2,Average....maybe,I was thrilled to find out that he had a cd coming out because I just loved his singing on Alley McBeal. But when I got in the car and popped it in I was disappointed. All the songs sound the same and not in a good way. If you want this cd wait until its in the 99 cent bin at Walmart.
5,Very Good,"Yes, I succumbed to the prejudice concerning actors who record albums and assumed that Downey's album would be mediocre at best and pretentious in general (sample Jeff Bridges' album for evidence to back up my prejudice), and for that I apologize to Mr. Downey. After hearing him on Letterman, however, I decided to listen to the samples, which led me to buy the album. It's a wonderful work.And yes, I hear the Dave Matthews and the Billy Joel and the Sting and all the other musical references others have mentioned. But there is, in fact, plenty of his soul and his personality and his passion on display here. I've enjoyed this album very much and hope he continues to record."
3,Uneven,"I love how other posters have tried to describe RDJ's voice. I will not. It's unique and what first drew me when I sampled this CD.The music itself is a mixed bag. The standout is Your Move, a must-hear. The first 3 songs on the CD are also quite good - you really feel RDJ's tortured soul and his anguished effort to exorcise his demons through music. I also loved Smile. Beyond that, the music and lyrics meander all over the place, not particularly tuneful or interesting, sometimes downright annoying.I am impressed that such a talented actor put the time and effort into this well-produced CD. Personally, I don't care if he ever makes another one."
5,Beautiful music to daydream or drive to,"I have never seen a RDJ movie, and have only seen him in numerous tv talk show appearences. I saw him play the piano and sing on a couple while promoting this album. I was impressed. Yes, his dreamy looks help get the initial attention, but the music draws you in further. I love the jazzy sound of the bass, guitars, and piano. This CD takes you to another place, I sit back and relax while listening to this. I love to pop this baby into the car's cd player--great to drive to. An interesting addition to anyone's collection--no matter the type of music fan you are."
5,Don't Let the Title Fool You,"This is a very well researched work on a very plausable scenario in which OUR Government could have engineered the assassination of John Lennon.I never was a big Lennon or Beatle fan, however the author here looks into all the devious underhanded surveillance that was conducted by the CIA, FBI and other agencies, not only against Lennon, but other notables that spoke against war, poverty, the establishment.Those of you that will write this off as ""conspiracy bunk"" just keep sleep walking. You'll wake up some day.A good read."
2,"A jumbled look at the killer, not much more","This book purports to prove or at least suggest that Lennon's murder was the result of a conspiracy. Somehow, MDC was under ""mind control"" when he shot the ex-Beatle.The author starts off by telling us he ""has no personal axe to grind""; yet, throughout the book he criticizes Reagan and Nixon every chance he gets while making it sound as if everyone in the U.S. carries a gun. No axe to grind indeed.The anti-American attitude gets a bit tiring after a while. For example: ""Lennon's body, wrapped incongruously in a black bag on a stretcher like a dead US Vietnam soldier..."". What are we to infer from that analogy? What purpose does it serve?As for the story itself, the book presents some interesting points but nothing concrete that can prove Lennon was murdered by the CIA or some other arm of the government. It's all conjecture. Interesting, like I said, but not much beyond that."
2,Bunch of baloney...,"Chock full of suppositions as to how Mark David Chapman was a mind-controlled assassin programmed by the CIA to kill John Lennon, since Lennon was coming out of retirement and was apparently going to speak at an anti-nuke rally (thus inspiring everyone around the world to abandon nuclear weapons and putting the military-industrial complex out of business). In the end, it's a bunch of mildly interesting bunk that lacks only the merit of being true...and if it IS true, one certainly wouldn't know it from the lack of evidence presented here (unless conjecture and innuendo count as evidence)."
2,With Violets,"I was disappointed that the writing and story was so 'fluff'. I was hoping for an in depth book of the life of Berthe Morisot and it seemed more like a light weight romance novel, using her as the main character."
1,Really this is the type of imagining that killed fiction,I am appalled by the banality of all the hyperbole in the way the author overdoes the emotional aspect of the story. Another thrill rippling through the heroine and I was ready to cast the book awayNot even Juliet was this tremulousOr at least that is what Will Shakepeare told me
2,A poor start.,"I read the first chapter of this book and was very disappointed by it. It did not seem to have enough art history in it, for a work of historical fiction, but had more of a 'romance' feel to it. That is certainly fine if that is the type of book you enjoy, but I prefer more history in my historical fiction."
2,Book needs editing! Did anyone proofread it?,"As I read With Violets, I felt as though I were reading an early version, only partially edited. Some chapters were fine, but in others, the grammar was so bad that it interfered with the story. I actually wrote to the author and publisher asking if I got a defective copy. This might have been a good book if they waited until it was ready to be published. You'll be tempted to take a red pen to it and send it back. I can't understand why Harper Collins would have released it like this."
4,With Violets,This was a beautiful story of forbidden love. Berthe was an amazing woman. She was so brave to follow her own dreams and set a new ideal for women in society and arts. In a profesion that started being only a career for men she made people take notice of her serious devotion to her work. I'm so glad that Berthe did not give in to the expections of society. We have a lot to learn from her.
5,masterful painting of what might've really happened...,"An incredible book. Beautiful wordsmithing that immerses you more fully into the characters' painterly world. Love how the author takes real-life letters of the female French Impressionist painter--and the other tidbits of info available and paints in the missing parts to create a truly engrossing story. You've got shades of AS Byatt's Possession, with a relationship between two (now) well-known Impressionist painters, and a story in the vein of Girl with a Pearl Earring, with a softer side to it. Strong heroine, intriguing relationship. Fun to see how the author imagines the story and how much you learn about the two painters along the way. If you like to learn about history while you get a great story, this book's for you. I knew nothing about Berthe Morisot before reading this, and it intrigued me to read more. I hope this author writes more stories like this!"
5,A heart's souffle,"Renoir subtitled this film ""a musical fantasy"", and it does have a Mozartian briskness, putting one in mind of Le Nozzi di Figaro, with its various romantic complications. Bergman, radiant, plays a Polish princess who is able to direct the destinies of various men through a talisman. She remains romantically detached, however, until she meets the dashing General Rollen (Jean Marais). The problem is Rollen's longtime friend Henri (Mel Ferrer)also loves the princess; thus ensues a romantic triangle.The movie has the airiness of a well-choreographed light operetta and is greatly abetted by Claude Renoir's superb color photography. There are occasional lapses in taste with the comic relief, but this is a lovely film worthy of repeated viewings."
4,Nice,"Marc Et Claude have yet made a great track.my favourites is the remix by cj stone and the ""love trance mix"".the others is good toexept the cheese radio versions"
1,Don't waste your money on this!!!!,"I don't understand why Amazon puts this under e-Books since all it is is a ""review"" of online courses NOT an e-Book.Additionally, the reviews are short and without supporting materials or examples. The same information can be obtain free of charge by searching the Internet."
2,"Just received it, tried it, not too impressed, yet","I just received, tried it, and I am not too impressed. For this amount of money I expected at least a more effective graphic user interface (anyone can do that now). But this CD performs slow, and it does not seem to have an effective search capability, so, I think it can't compete with the hard-copy."
5,I'm hooked on cast iron now!,"I am big into cooking, and have always wanted to add cast iron to my kitchen tools. I researched and found out that Lodge's pro-line was highly recommended by chefs and experienced home-cooks alike. Amazon had a great price, so I went for it. Well, now I'm hooked! This pan never leaves my stovetop (I'm glad it's so pretty to look at) because I use it multiple times a week. Keeping it seasoned is imperative (as for any cast iron pan) and the maintenance is high...but it is SO worth it.My food actually tastes better using this pan. The way it sears the outside of the meat while cooking the inside slowly...wow. I usually just use this one pan--I cook up my fish, and when it's nearly done, I throw in fresh veggies (like asparagus, mushrooms, broccoli--whatever) and cook it there in the pan for just a few minutes. Easy cooking, easy cleanup."
2,Biased and incomplete.,"As a relatively young American, with little knowledge of the conflict in the Balkans, I decided to pick up a book that would give me an unbiased opinion on the conflict, so that I could form my own opinion. I thought that a book with the title, ""Serbs and Croats: The Struggle in Yugoslavia"" would be such a book. I was wrong. While informative, the information does have a very strong slant. This is probably due to the heavy influence the Serbs have on the media. It is the same influence that led to our nation's ignorance of the Concentration camps set up in Serbia and Croatia during the war. So, if you are looking for an interesting and quick read on the topic, this is a book to read, however, if you want an unbiased book, this is NOT the book to read. I have also picked up Croatia: A History, which is surprisingly much less biased, and much more thorough. I would recommend that book over Serbs and Croats, if you want something more substantial, and less biased."
1,Greater Serbian Garbage!,"Plain & simple, this book is garbage! However, this is a great example of how Serbs try to manipulate historical facts for their own good. Mr. Dragnich is also a good example of the type of hatred and show of disrespect Serbian extremists have for their fellow neighbours, whether it be Croats, Bosnians, Albanians, Macedonians, etc. It is hard to believe that this man actually taught at Vanderbilt University. To think his students learned nothing! What a waste of tuition! Save yourself some money and get this one at the library like I did if you are interested in how Serbian extremists think. One star is two stars too much for this book!"
3,Into the Tangle of Friendship,"I couldn't really get into this book enough to finish reading it. But you may love it. We are all different in our taste, right?"
2,Not that Good. Sorry,"First, let me get on my soapbox once more to decry the 'star inflation' that is found on this website. I mean, get real, are all the books out there really deserving of 5 stars! This book is a case in point. Don't get me wrong, memoirs are my favorite genre. But this book is tedious. Beth is a very likable person, only it seemed like she couldn't make up her mind. Did she want to write a memoir, or a book of essays on friendship? Instead of choosing one, she decided to do both; without pulling it off. I also did not find her prose to be luminous or poetic, but overwraught. Sorry. Finally, at several points in the book I got the feeling that Beth was searching out friendship opportunities with an eye that they could be included in the book she was working on. Beth, if you ever read this, please don't be discouraged by this review. You do have talent. Just don't try so hard."
2,Who Will Love Her Now?,"First of all I would like to say if this is what she has to offer than I don't think she will ever live up to her hot single ""I Do Both Jay & Jane"". Really the beats to these remixes are enoying and you can't even make out the song (If There is one)because every time you put a different remix on it is so mixed up that you don't even know what going on. What up with the Spanish Version? (Just Horrible) The only reason I'm giving her a 2 is because after the first 5 remixes I gave up meaning that there might be some actually good scrubble on here. It's sad to see such talent go to waste like this. She leaves us with this song and I leave you with this question, Who Will Love Her Now?"
3,Bach well tempered clavier book 1 by Parmentier,"This account of Bach's well tempered clavier book 1 by Edward Parmentier is by no means bad but is no match for the superior performanceof those players listed below.Parmentier's recording benefits from outstanding sound quality and a magnificent harpsichord but his choice of tempi in some places coupled with quite frequent hesitations which hinder the flow of the music just didn't work for me.Really good harpsichord performances of book 1 are pretty hard to come by but Bob Van Asperen,Glen Wilson,Pieter Jan Belder,Luc Beausejour and Gary Cooper remain the finest available."
4,It's all in the delivery.,"I enjoyed all three books, i.e. Da Vinci, Angels..., and Deception Point. I read the unabridged Da Vinci, and enjoyed it more than the abridged ""audio"" Da Vinci. The man who read Da Vinci, was very monotone, and detracted from the plot. However, the persons who did Angels and Deception Point were excellent, and definitely added to the final product. I highly recommend all three. Dan Brown is extremely talented, and knows how to grab the reader and immerse them into the plot."
5,great books,these are two great books. yeah dan brown write smart books but they are fun. dont listen to that other guy these books are fun.
3,needs tweaking,I am hard on cell phones and this was a good buy. Dropped the case several times and phone survived. Plastic on the on the door cracked when hitting the arm of an office chair. It did save the screen.
1,Poor Design is Sure to Disappoint,"I am deeply disappointed with this ""Hard Case"". First, the belt clip had no locking mechanism so everytime I sat down the case would disconnect from the belt clip and fall to the floor. I went to Radio Shack the day after I received this item in the mail and bought a locking type belt clip. That wouldn't have been so bad if that was the only problem. The second problem I encountered was the case clasp. This poorly designed clasp failed to keep the lid of the case closed. Consequently, my phone fell out of the case to the floor. I am only fortunate that it fell on carpeting rather than some hard concrete floor or sidewalk. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this item. You will be disappointed and you could end up having to spend a great deal more money fixing or replacing your phone."
1,Not a Good Case for Your Phone,"I purchased this case to protect my Cingular 8925. Seemed like a good case at first, but two days into it the belt clip fell apart. I put another clip on it, and while taking my kids out of the car the door to the case opened up and my phone fell out (it needs a lock). Finally, a small piece of sharp metal on the case came off and punctured my finger.On a positive note, the company I purchased it from was responsive and offered a replacement or different item. Unfortunately my phone was damaged and I had to replace it with a different model and the company does not have cases for my new phone. I have not yet completely resolved the issue."
3,Works good but could be better,"The case fits nice and works great, but the removeable post that clips onto the belt is too tall causing the unit to catch on things and the post to break.At least I don't have to worry about hitting the hangup key while removing the unit from the holster like I did with the stock holster.A shorter screw in post for the belt clip would get this closer to a 5 star item."
2,Just ok,"I found it to add too much weight when trying to use it as a belt clip and it was too cumbersome trying to get it out of the holder. I'm actually using this as a car holder instead of a belt clip. I just attached it to my dash, and set the phone inside while I'm driving so I can easily see who's calling. Works well in that function."
5,Great,"I think the new music is great! They have grown so much as a band. My favorite song is ""Over Easy"". However, there is not a bad song. Seeing them live was a wonderful."
3,"A good theatrical experience, but no singer is outstanding","To me, this sounds like a good ensemble performance mounted in a third-tier German opera house, which is exactly what this Das Rheingold from Stuttgart is. None of the singers stand out in an exciting way, nor is the conducting either intense or dramatic. But you get the palpable feeling of a live performance, and the opera itself never fails to make an impression.As often hapens when house singers fill out a big cast, you never know who's going to shine. In this case ERda has a wonderful voice, while Mime and Loge both have impact. It's too bad that the Wotan sounds a bit old and wobbly, and that Alberich is nowhere near being bitter and fierce enough.Even so, there aren't many budget Rheingolds out there in good modern sound, and Naxis's enitre produciton is respectable on all counts. Look elsewhere for depth and thrills, however."
2,Wrong about paganism in the United States,"As a general overview of (neo) pagan beliefs, the book is basically accurate. However, the author clearly has no understanding of American religious beliefs, history, or American culture in general. Conceptually, the book is often astoundingly wrong--see the other Amazon reviews--and the book lacks even the basic facts about paganism or any religion in the United States. The author has not consulted the readily available scholarly work on neopaganism in the United States, and he seems unfamiliar with pagan authors as well."
1,Not funny.,"This is considered something of a classic, but it beats me why. A pseudo-history, full of lame attempts at humor. To call it sophomoric is an insult to sophomores."
3,It is a cute book,"I bought it because I thought it was cute. It is. A little instructional, but mostly cute for people who like Yoga and Babar."
4,Introduce yoga to the little ones,This is a very good book. The illustrations are fun and playful. It was helpful introducing yoga to the kids.
1,Came twice w/out poster.,"I ordered this book for the poster that comes with it (in description: ""The book includes a large, removable poster."" My friend has it and it does come with a great poster. I came w/out the poster, I contacted Amazon who promised that if returned and re-ordered, it would come w/the poster. The 2nd time I got a smaller book, again without the poster. I called Amazon who told me to return again and that the product would be placed under investigation and not available during that time. They said after about 10 days, check the item, if it's avail then you can reorder. I'm surprised to see it is still available, though, it's been a few days only and it was always available. I'd love to get it with the poster but won't risk a 3rd order!"
5,what a smashing success,"I very much enjoyed the adventures of Babar when I was younger. This book has just tickled my fancy and I am ordering one for my yoga teacher and partner. It is well done, entertaining, extremely accurate (how do elephants get into those poses when I can't?) and a great treasure for someone into the practice of yoga. This will be on my list of Eastern-themed gift books to give this Holiday season, along with my other favorite gift book Open Your Mind, Open Your Life by Taro Gold."
3,Not the best of Erma,"This a cute coffee table book, but I didn't realize that it was just a few words per page."
4,Great medallion,"I bought this as I was in need of a new Baphomet medallion. This is a well crafted piece of jewelry. The actual medallion is a bit on the heavy side. The chain that came with it actually looks good and is not undersized. Be warned though, the clasp sucks. Mine broke after wearing the necklace twice. The only fix was to completely remove the clasp ends and put the ends of the chain together by opening them up. This ended up looking better anyways."
4,Awesome evil necklace!,"As I play guitar in a Death Metal band, these types of accessories are required. This one however, kicks it up a notch in the evil department. At our last gig, I unveiled this for the first time. It allowed us to play our title song ""Unholy Blasphemous Church Ripper"" at least twice as evil as before! Before you knew it, the unholy one himself appeared and caused a catastrophic disaster, enveloping the entire crowd. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent quality.,"A lot of the problems I've had buying jewelry online is that you never know how sturdy the item is, or how big. This product is by far the best pentacle necklace I've purchased online (and I've bought a few). It is fairly large, with a good heavy chain, and the actual pendant is made of thick pewter and well detailed. This is a good quality product."
3,Looks cool...,"Unfortunately it's kept more as a decoration in my house because I don't like the black marks it leaves around my neck. I don't want to look like an unbathed demon. And what if my girlfriend decides to start biting on my neck? Then she may get led poisoning. Hopefully I haven't already. But hey, it looks awesome..."
5,Star Wars Monopoly ROCKS!,"This game is a terrific new version of the classic. All the same rules apply of course, but if you choose, the game comes with instructions for a Star Wars twist! I won't tell you what it is, but I will tell you it has something to do with the dice. The game comes with eight character tokens (four are good guys, four are bad guys) and a blue die and a red die. The colors come in handy when playing the star Wars version. You buy and trade for planets. You buy settlements and citys instead of houses and hotels. I think it's great fun! Although I've lost every game to my little brothers! Oh, and for all you big Star wars fans out there, the instructions come with a translation guide for the Star wars galaxy Aurebush language. It helps you to read the words on the ""Republic credits"". All in all it's a great game, so get out there and play! May the Force be with you!"
4,"Same rules, different look","I was surprised at how nice the game looked when we took it out! The pieces are lovely and my son displays the tiny figures on his desk. I was disappointed in the characters they choice for the game. Also, it is just a ""pretty"" Monopoly game. The cards are still worded the same, just with different art work. If you like Monopoly and you enjoy Star Wars - this is a great blend....I am just not sure why they made it?? Cashing in?"
2,A good album for Valassko enthusiasts.,"This recording, produced in France, is a ""just ok"" representation of the folk music of Valassko, E. Moravia. The band is average, and the female vocalist tends to sing ""in the back of the throat""; however, there are some rockin' tunes. One of the best is the first one, Pod kopcem Hostynem. For REALLY great music from Valassko, look for Cimbalova muzika TECHNIK and the vocalists Jarmila Sulakova or Josef Laza. If you can find them."
3,Overrated or impossible to translate?,"Having spent some time working for a political organization in Turkey and traveling on buses through Anatolia (Pamuk captures this experience perfectly), I had a small advantage over the average non-Turkish reader. But only a small one. Does the fact that the book sold faster than any other in the history of Turkish literature but to me remains nearly impenetrable mean that I'm missing something? I'm sure that I am missing a great deal. Give it a chance, but don't expect a great deal of satisfaction."
4,an orientalist point of wiew,"Pamuk-extraordinaryly- is a well known Turkish novelist in west.What makes him so?For me his ""orientalism""!He is a Turkish but he has a western point of wiew,that's why he's called orientalist.But i must confess ""the new life"" is a masterpiece..."
2,Started well but then got very dull,"As a voracious reader of literature myself, I could initially identify with the idea that reading a book could change your life. But the main character in this book just seemed so overwhelmingly lost and in general, the book felt like the author was on pot or something when he wrote it. I held out, however, (it was a birthday gift from my little sister after all) and I finished the book so I have to say that after pages and pages of dull narrative the ending was relatively interesting and almost cool. But still, I wouldn't have missed anything if I hadn't read this book and I don't know if I want to give this author another chance. I'm all for searching for the things that will give one's life a deeper and truer meaning, but this book is just boring, even if it is set in one of my most favourite countries in the world."
1,bizarre waste of paper,My first feeling after reading this book was that I would have been better off watching tv. Then I felt the need for a nice long shower. The author attempts to show some greater meaning in life but just gets lost in trying to be overly clever.
5,"Remarkable novel which opens your eyes to a ""new"" world!","This is one of the most well written, dramatic, engrossing and indispensable books I have ever stumbled upon. Beautiful and thought-provoking language makes this novel of a young man's search for love and the meaning of life absolutely irresistable. It was such a long time ago that I read something of the same intensity that I had to hold myself back in order to gain some time to ponder over the things I read, that it took me 2 weeks to read this book, even though normally it would have taken me a day and a night. Also, I tried to slow down because I did not want the reading experience to end. The New Life opened my eyes to THIS LIFE and I will be forever in awe of Orhan Pamuk, the author of this powerful creation, for making me feel this way."
1,"An empty, repetitive, dark, miserable book","A New Life might have made an okay short story, but the three hundred dreary pages are without any richness or depth. Read a synopis and save a lot of time and weariness!"
1,black narcissus,The book arrived in a timely fashion and was as described. I am very happy with the service and am looking forward to reading this 70 year old novel.
1,Don't bother,"On new high/low, move position stop to most recent reaction low/high; there is no simpler stop method. Ignore title: almost entirely about stock selection rather than stops."
3,nice.....but,"The first one I had lasted a year and a half and then started having problems - I had to replace the main gear ($45.) but after another couple of months it died. I ordered a new one through Amazon and it came in an undamaged factory sealed box inoperable: the bowl holder would not move up and down at all. It was frozen in one spot. When I called Kitchen aid and told them what was wrong they seemed to know about that fault and shipped me another one immediately no question. Maybe some got through the system without being inspected, who knows.We use these units every day. The factory description says 'professional' grade. I sure hope the new one lasts longer than a year and a half!"
1,Iron filings falling into bowl,"We bought this mixer new to prepare bread and other items, as arthritis has prevented kneading by hand. We got the professional version, thinking it would be stronger and more durable than other models. It worked well for a while. Shortly after 1 year, we noticed considerable iron filings falling into the bowl from the the mixer. As this was beyond the warranty, we were unable to return the item. We tried to use a plastic lid to catch the filings, but this was really not a good solution.I would have to give this a very poor rating and people should be aware of this problem (and look for it) when using this machine. At the price paid for this, I would have expected much better."
5,brute force available,"I've owned this machine for years, using mostly for kneading bread. Since most of my breads are stiff sourdoughs weighing 40 to 70 ounces, every batch is a strain on this mixer. Being in a wheelchair, I don't have much choice.A few years ago it ground to a halt - back for service. Again yesterday. Sigh."
5,5 Plus 5 Mixer,"Well, we were excited to find this product at a reduced price. We have had another KitchenAid for over 15 years and it works just fine still. So we decided to pack it up to our mountain cabin so the grandkids and Grama can learn some new things during the summer with new recipes. They are taking a lot of interest in learning to cook and baking is an easy way to learn about cooking together. (I can see I will need to walk an extra mile/day to get through the summer!)It has more power and bigger bowl than our old model, so look out counters here comes the flour!We are very happy with our purchase and have usually found that Amazon has the best prices and in-stock items, so when I went to register our purchase at KitchenAid I was connected to ""everythingkitchens.com"" and found a price ($296.10) about $23 lower than Amazon and Free Shipping, too. Might be worth a look when you are pricing and buying appliances for your kitchen. I know we will!"
1,Junk.,"DO NOT BUY. Kitchen Aid mixers do not hold up, nor are they of the quality they used to be. The old stories of these mixers lasting for 25 years or more are history. I was mixing bread dough with mine and the gears just stripped. My local appliance repair man told me these are now made in China with plastic parts and don't hold up at all. He repaired it but the KitchenAid replacement parts have broken again. Time for a new mixer."
5,Great Product,"I absolutely love this mixer! So far we've only made bread, pizza dough and cookies but it's so easy to use and cleans up quick (that's the important part). Very professional."
1,Kitchen Aid Mixer Stand Mixer,"My mixer is used a few times a year, so imagine my surprise when I had a puddle of oil underneath it the other day. I called Kitchen Aid and they want $32 to ship it to a repair facility, $25 for a diagnosis fee that will be applied to repairs, but if not reparable I am just out the money, no offers on a new machine or anything. They actually said that I hadn't used it enough, therefore a seal broke. So much for the Kitchen Aid Warranty.KitchenAid KSM75WH Classic Plus Tilt-Head 4-1/2-Quart Stand Mixer, WhiteThey do sell refurbished machines; I have to question where they get the ones to refurbish. I am trying to find a local repair service, but no luck so far. I doubt that I will ever invest in Kitchen Aid again, I don't think they are worth the additional price, and the customer service is deplorable."
5,just what I wanted,"this colour was hard to find in the bigger mixer, I was told to spend a little more, but i almost didn't because I could not find this colour and model in Canada."
5,"Love it, love it, love it",Have never regretted buying htis beautiful machine. I use it all the time and am SO happy with it!! WOuld recommend it to anybody who likes to bake or make bread. Makes it easy!!
4,great mixer - sturdy and tall,"The kitchenaid Mixer I received as a wedding gift along time ago sufferred a recent demise. I cconsidered replacing it with the Bosch Universal Plus but instead went with this KitchenAid Pro 5Plus. It has a hefty motor and pretty appearance. It is very capable. It is a little tall and will not fit under my cabinet nor allow the kitchen cabinetry to open so It needs to be set somewhere that doesn't happen. I am most excited about the price and Black Friday starting early this year. I got this $429 mixer for under $200. Macy's was having a 40% off sale, plus if you open a Macy's card, you get an extra 20% off plus they had a 10% off coupon as you walk in the door plus a $30 mail-in rebate. SCORE! I filled out the little let Amazon know about a better price at the competition, but I didn't see the price change on Amazon, so I got stuck with paying California Sales tax but still netted a fantastic price! : )"
3,professional kitchenaid mixer,"I thought it would be a good idea to have a larger kitchenaid mixer as I already have the smaller one, and have probably had it 15 to 20 years.While making large batches of cookies, the old mixer had a tendency to jump around and it seemed to almost take more power than it had.However, the new one takes up too much room on my kitchen counter, is very heavy, and only has one bowl that fits. The old one had a smaller size bowl also which was good for cake frostings.I'm thinking of trying to sell the new one and start using my old one again as it's really not convenient."
2,Another Waste of Money,"This purported heavy-duty mixer died after less than a year. Kitchen-Aid used to make excellent products, but I'm not buying them anymore."
2,Good Mixer for about a Year...,"Buy this mixer if you don't mind fixing it every 1-2 years. We had the Pro 5 mixer for just over a year and loved it. Just after the warranty expired the mixer started making loud grinding sounds in the gear box area. We had the mixer repaired and it was not cheap compared to the price we paid for it. It may have the word ""pro"" in its model name but it's a consumer quality mixer. It's probably worth spending double the price for a real pro grade mixer that will last 10+ years."
5,"Used my mixer for the first time, and it delivered","I just made my popular khachapuri modification using my mixer, and I have to say it delivered well. I am a one man show in our kitchen as my wife doesn't cook, so when I make khachapuri it can get overwhelming. There are times during the recipe where things have to be done at one time, and there are parts of the recipe that used to wear my arm out (like folding cold butter into the flour). With the mixer, I just set about its way as I complete other tasks. The best part is the easy and convenient cleanup. I had my khachapuri done and all utensils cleaned from start to finish in 2 hours (including 1 hour of refigeration on the dough and 50 minutes cooking). No way I could do that when I was using my elbow grease for everything. Adding the shredder attachment worked very well for the cheeses. I can definitely see that I will be using my mixer on a regular basis going forward, and I already plan to experiment with new recipes."
2,Not what I expected,"I wish I had kept my old mixer, especially since it was working well after many years of use. This mixer is not worth the price and the hype."
1,This is NOT your momma's KitchenAid,"The original KitchenAid mixers were manufactured by the consumer division of Hobart.In 1986, Hobart decided to concentrate on the professional market, and sold off their consumer division, KitchenAid, to Whirlpool. Since then it has been one problem after another with several of the models.They maintain the visual appearance because of the reputation,but cheapen the insides with plastic gears that fail regularly.If you can find one, buy a used KitchenAid/Hobart machine.On the nameplate it will say ""KitchenAid by Hobart"".Those are the machines that last forever. If it doesn't say HOBART,don't spend your $$$."
5,Perfect!,I owned the Artisan head-tilt stand mixer for about 8 years and loved it! I recently upgraded for more stability when I make breads and pastas... it's amazing. KitchenAid stand mixers make life much simpler. Just buy it!
4,Mostly Great,"My husband and I got this as a gift from my inlaws. For the most part it's absolutely wonderful, I use it all the time. The only down side is that the whisk doesn't quite make it to the bottom of the bowl so I have to stop everything and scrape it with a spatula halfway through. We were told the Viking mixer doesn't have that problem and if we had to start all over again we'd probably spend the extra money on that instead. Still, it is absolutely worth having, we havent had any ther problems with it."
5,Best workhorse of the kitchen,"KitchenAid KV25GOXGR Professional 5 Plus 5-Quart Stand Mixer, Imperial GreyBought this mixer back in 2006 because I had heard and, subsequent research showed, that it was a very sturdy mixer. I use it for everything and am contemplating buying the grinder attachment. I bake a lot of bread in the fall, winter & spring, so this mixer has gotten a workout and I can't imagine doing all that kneading anymore (I do finish kneading by hand, but this has taken all the initial mixing and kneading off my hands (pun intended). The mixer is large and will take up room on your counter. I tried storing it in the pantry but it is very heavy to lift.I would recommend this mixer to everyone."
1,Enjoyed it while it lasted...,"I liked this mixer a lot - while it lasted.Unfortunately, like a lot of other reviewers have noted on the web, the 500 Pro series tends to simply quit without a whimper.And a call to Kitchenaid on 1-30-2012 confirms that KA no longer repairs these unless it is less than a year old.They will replace them if they are within the one-year warranty, and you are willing to pay the shipping.It was a wonderful mixer, but it just died with no warning; all the legendary Kitchenaid Service and warranty information is long gone.These are surely cheap enough, but not when you have to consider them disposable.Now I need to find a brand that will stand behind its product.I liked the product, but the company has lost a 3rd generation customer."
3,Not As Good As They Used To Be,"Although it is generally a good (not great), mixer, the gears are poorly machined and/or of poor quality, so it is loud and mine has needed quite a few repairs because the gears break easily. My repairman mentioned that KitchenAid has switched to nylon (basically plastic) gears, so their longevity has gone down the chute. I am disappointed that I spent so much money on an appliance that probably won't give me even 5 years of use. I will be looking for a different brand when it is time to replace this."
4,Great Machine!!!,"(I waited to write this review to be sure of my purchase)...After reading many reviews, both negative and positive I took the plunge and bought my Kitchen Aid and I am very happy with it. It came in a sturdy package with not bumps or bruises to the box. I unpacked it and made bread the very same day, it handled the kneeding the dough with out complaint. I only make one loaf at a time (it does take 8 cups of flour though.) So far I've made probably 20 loaves of various types, several cakes and multiple batches of cookies all without issue. I absolutley love it. Time will tell if there are longevity issues but I took an extended warantee just in case."
5,Great addition to the kitchen,"Powerful, versatile, and looks good sitting on the counter. Easy to use and easy to change attachments. The gold standard for stand mixers."
2,THE NEW CHANGES,"I BOUGHT THE KITCHENAID PROFESSIONAL 5 PLUS, 5 QUART STAND MIXER FOR MYSELF, IN DECEMBER, 2011. IT IS O.K., WITH THE EXCEPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE OVER ALL DESIGN. I REALLY DO NOT THINK THAT CHANGING THE BOWL FROM THE NARROW ONE, TO THIS WIDE ONE IS FOR THE BEST. I DO NOT SEE THAT IT HAS ACCOMPLISHED ANY THING. MY OLD KITCHENAID MIXER HAD THE NARROW BOWL AND IT WORKED WITH EVERYTHING JUST FINE. THIS NEW DESIGN IS WORTHLESS, AND MORE BULKY TO HANDLE. I WISH I HAD KNOWN IN ADVANCE, THAT IT WOULD NOT COME WITH THE NARROW BOWL. I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT SOME OTHER MODEL WITH A NARROW BOWL. I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO CHANGE IT. I HAVE ONLY USED IT ONE TIME, BECAUSE I REALLY DO NOT LIKE IT.ARE YOU LISTENING KITCHENAID???"
5,Blue Monster,Love it and don't know how I baked without it. Shipped fast and is all I expected plus some.
5,Great purchase,"Great product, great price. Thanks to Amazon Prime had to pay no shipment fee for such a heavy article. I can't wait to purchase all the gadgets that can be added to the mixer."
2,Very different and disappointed,"After 10CC GC made 2 very interesting albums, L and Freeze Frame. This one from 1981 was full of 80's ambience which completely destroyed their somewhat avant-garde style from the post 10CC period prior. The songs are repetitive to the point of being annoying and the singing and lyrics are inane. There is no trademark thick harmonies, no Gizmo, no spectacular production that one would expect from GC. Boring and forgettable. What happened? They went into video. The best album in Freeze Frame by far."
4,Never received!,"These are lovely champagne flutes, but I know that ONLY because I already own them. Needing to add to my collection, I ordered this set through Amazon from Wine Enthusiasts. Glasses did not arrive and no communication with seller until I contacted him. Glasses are back ordered. I canceled the order.The original glasses are tall, slender, and classically lovely. They are delicate and require handwashing and careful storage.When I reorder, I'll use a different seller."
1,Rip off on shipping,"You've got to be kidding - the shipping is almost as much as the TV!!! You can get Large 60"" + CRT big screens shipped for less than this!!!!! AVOID RIP-OFF'S LIKE THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
3,Classic bubble gum,"If you like english bubblegum this is you're disc! It is groovy in the truest sense however, if you are looking for 60's hard rock/ protopunk or the caveman whollop of wild thing it represents less than a quarter of the album. most of the hard hitting fuzzbox stuff is in the bonus tracks and it is tasty! I'm still looking for there super tough fuzzbox stuff..."
3,good package but old translation,"I really like all of the extras included in this Bible. After a lot of shopping that's why I chose this NLT, but I was very disappointed to find that it is the pre-2004 version of the NLT. I didn't think they would still be selling the first version, but alas, they are. If you want the newest NLT, this one's not for you. If you don't care, this has a great set of extras."
5,And the Tracks Are:,Tracks:1. Jerry Rivera - Quiero (Original Version)2. Patricia Manterola - Que El Ritmo No Pare3. Luis Enrique - Alma Rosa (Ballad Version)4. Donato Poveda - Bohemio Enamorado5. So Pra Contrariar - Cuando Acaba El Placer6. Cristian - Azul7. Los Ilegales - Una Copa De Licor8. Pablo Montero - Gata Salvaje9. Gisselle - Voy a Quitarme el Anillo (Version Balada)10. Frankie Negron - Comerte a Besos
4,Good Read,Good Read. Alot on history. Great for my studying toward Architectural Licensure. I recommend to anyone in architecture or Engineering field.
4,Why Buildings Standup,The condition of the book was like new.I learned a great deel about the engineering andconstruction of man-made structures. It includesthe everyday structures as well as internationallyknown structures.
2,"Interesting, but outdated","The contents of the book are interesting; alas, and probably because it was written over 30 years ago, the author has stuck to the exclusive use of the now outdated Imperial units, making the book almost useless for readers educated outside Burma, Liberia and the US of A.Which is a pity."
4,"Parts you slog through, parts you gobble","Salvadori clearly explains, with the invaluable aid of lots of little pictures, how and why buildings stand up. There are chapters on cathedrals, the Eiffel Tower, the Hagia Sophia, bridges, domes, and so forth. The chapter on wind is particularly fascinating--I found out a lot of things I'd had no idea of. Other chapters, like ""Form-Resistant Structures,"" were pretty deadly dull. Overall, though, the book was well worth reading. It's not always entertaining, but it's always informative, and sometimes tremendously interesting."
5,Delightfully droll! We enjoyed every minute of it!!,"The fresh, unusual and highly amusing account of two young teachers who spend the summer of 1943 working the swing shift on the production line of a San Diego bomber plant. A hit when it first appeared in 1944, the book has now been reissued by the Smithsonian. Just as much fun to read today as it was then, the book, with its light hearted text and illustrations, will surely be a hit again!"
1,A valiant attempt to use sociobiology to analyze business,The author has attempted to use concepts from sociobiology to provide a way to evaluate business ethics and practice. It is badly flawed because he does not understand some of the basic sociobiological principles he needs to accomplish his goal.
4,Cars Cupcake Toppers,"Amazon did not provide a good picture but I took the risk and ordered these anyway, and they turned out to be pretty cute. I took product pictures and uploaded them to the item description. I'll also add a pic of the cupcakes we made. I thought the price was high for the number of toppers you get, which is why I only gave 4 stars."
4,decent cake toppers,"I used these, just one McQueen and one Mater, as cake toppers. I made a road out of crushed oreos and placed them on the road. They were perfect for this because I still had plenty of room on my 9x13 cake to write with icing. They aren't super high quality...the paint job isn't perfect, but they were great for a 4 year old's birthday cake. Just as a note, they are kind of small because they are intended to top cupcakes, but it worked fine on the cake too."
2,Careful!,"These were cute, but the wheels come off very easily. Since this goes on a young child's cake, they could eat, and choke, on the little wheels. I ended up not using them."
4,great pizza peel,"Excellent design with a perfect taper. It is unfinished, which is a good thing. As advertised at at a great price."
4,Tropical Nudes,"Working out of Paris, France, Bruno Poinsard is a rising star in the world of fashion photography. Tropical Blend is his first book. And it's a fantastic introduction to his work, especially his beauty photography and nudes. It features a wide and breathtaking variety of models from the fashion world, generally set about in lush, tropical settings. If lovely, lithesome, naked beauties, taken from the pages of magazines such as Vogue, Harpers, and Glamour are your thing, then this is your book. And together with Poinsard's superb photography and creative composition, this is one fantastic publication for lovers of the female form."
3,"Some Excellent Portrait Shots, But Not The Book It's Made Out To Be","The location shots are fair at best and in most cases not anywhere you would long to see in person. This is disappointing since after several trips to the Hawaiian Islands and the US Virgin Island I know first hand there is much more dramatic scenery readily available. The subject matter as reveiwed earlier seems to focus on young girls which is both positive and negative. The portraits are very sensuous and I found myself wishing the entire book was filled with portrait images alone. On the other hand the full and partial body shots seemed like a waste due to the skinny models and ho-hum scenery. The photographer does have talent and I would really look forward to seeing more of his portrait work in the future. All in all though if you are looking for a book featuring fully grown women in lush tropical settings, you should keep on looking."
1,Lousy service,I have not received this product I can not review the product but the service is terrible. How about finding me a book.Scott Reynolds DVM
4,The Kaufmann translation is better,"While Beyond Good and Evil is probably the quintessial Nitzschean piece, I would have to say Zimmern's translation lags behind Kaufmann's. Although her use of quaint Elizabethan English is charming, and her edition has a beautifully personal touch to it (Zimmern was Nietzsche's dinner companion and erstwhile friend), the mistakes in her translation, while subtle, detract from it, especially when precision of language is so important for reading this book. Go with Kaufmann."
2,"Great book, horrible edition","This book is one of Nietzsche's classics, but I am not rating the content of this book rather this unfortunate edition. Amazon has recently gotten into a bad habit of selling cheap reprints of classic works, I had a similar problem with a copy of Ulysses I purchaced a few months back. This book is poorly bound, has a horrible cover design, has no notes or annotations (which are almost a necessity for a book like this), and it opens with a disclaimer so politically correct it would make poor Friedrich roll over in his grave. The bottom line? Don't buy this version."
2,Beyond Good and Evil,It was very hard to buy online when you can read about the product as there where many similar editions to this book. I am not satisfied with this purchase.
3,Great method to learn how to make donuts,"I had been looking for ways to make donuts in larger batches, this dvd set was very helpful for that. Clear easy to follow video, and lots of tips and hints."
1,Waste of Money,Bought the battery. Charged for two days. Zero power. Charged for a week. Still not working. Charged for two weeks. Clearly this is a bad battery or my charger is broken. Did a search for a new charger for this battery but the original charger (No. 92990 18V Charger) sold with the drill and battery does not appear to be available anymore. Frankly I am disappointed that I even bothered to buy this new battery in the first place because the original drill and battery had very little use and there is no reason for the original battery to have last for such a short time. I'd return this battery but I have now had it for two months and don't have the original packaging. Have decided to completely avoid all SKIL products
2,battery doesn't hold charge,this is the second battery i have purchased and neither one holds a charge very long . i will not buy any more batterys from amozon. skil 180bat 18-volt NiCad Pod Style battery Pack.
5,Perfect,The battery I got from Amazon (Skil B180) is perfect! And the price was the best I could find anywhere.Don Z.
2,Buy a DeWalt,The Skil batteries are junk. They run down very quickly. Can't get even the smallest job done without recharging. After several recharges it goes completely dead. Don't waste your money.
1,"No, no, no. You don't want to visit this Cedar Rapids.","Every one of the actors in this film was believable. The script was just poorly written. Not funny, stupidly vulgar, and often cringe inducing. Trust me, you have better things to do with your two hours."
2,not funny...,I thought this was boring and predictable. A couple parts were funny but overall not worth renting. Much prefered Bridesmaids or Our Idiot Brother.
1,Not Good,"After looking at all the positive reviews, I am wondering if they watched the same film as me. I gave it 30 minutes and then had to turn it off, I couldn't stand any more. It just came over as bad direction and not very good script. All the characters did not seem to be comfortable with their roles. Nothing was funny about it, waste of time.."
3,Not that funny,"This movie was not nearly as good as I thought it was going to be. There were definitely funny parts, but overall a big letdown."
1,Seriously? Funny?,"Apparently I'm in the minority again because I'm seeing praise for this movie, but I was bored to death watching the first 1/2 hour. Not one, mind you, one funny moment. Watching some small town guy go to THE big city... Cedar Rapids... ugh.ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz"
2,Where Do They Come Up With This Stuff?,"Tim Lippe (Ed Helms - should have stuck to 'The Office') is a diligent insurance salesman in a small time. His boss, and the office's top salesguy, dies early in the film. Tim is then ordered to attend a conference in Cedar Rapids to win an industry honor. Ed has never left town and fluster about leaving his lover and former grade school teacher (Sigourney Weaver) who he doesn't realize is just using him as a 'boy toy.'Tim loses himself in drinking, drugs, and sex. Then he finds his roots again, casts off the pretentiousness of applying for the award, and also acquires a new, true love (Anne Heche).Not funny or interesting; doesn't even have a plot of any substance."
2,Another Failure,"Between Ed Helms and John C. Reilly one would figure this would be classic. It was not the worst movie I have ever seen but certainly not the funniest. There were not many laughs at all and stuck in between was this very awkward storyline that attempted to be a well rounded script, but just failed on every level. It was very uncomfortable at times when it seemed sometimes was meant to be funny, but I was not sure what to do because it wasn't. It is not one of those movies that you can watch over and over, still laugh and have fun. Its more like a movie you can watch when you have extra money to waste, see it at a garage sale or something, or if you can borrow it off the schmuck that actually bought it. Not really worth it at all. I sat through it constantly waiting for a good laugh that never really came. The black guy was definetly funnier than anyone else."
4,Good Movie,"The guy from the office delivers in this movie. I enjoy story line, and it is kind of funny. Definitely worth a rental!!"
3,"Ok, But Not Great","This was worth a watch, and maybe another watch sometime down the road a ways, but definitely not one I would own. It was an alright comedy, but a lot of the comedies anymore these days just aren't living up to a lot of the classic ones from the 80s and 90s I would have to say. Only a select few comedies have really been great since the early 2000s, such as Wedding Crashers and Hangover and Due Date & such. A lot of the ones I'm seeing anymore these days just aren't all that impressive. Still, if you're into comedy, this is worth a watch, but not much more than that I'm afraid."
1,Just not funny,"Wanted it to be funny, I like all the actors, but there was only one brief laugh toward the end of the movie. I repeat, one laugh. This is not a funny movie, not silly, not good."
1,crappy rapids,"This movie was not funny. i watched the whole thing waiting, praying even for one laugh that never came! I'm not mad about the money I spent to rent this movie, but I am pissed at the hour and a half of my life i lost watching this horrible movie. Just light your money on fire and save yourself the time!"
3,silly,"...i like the entire cast, and the fact that it was a 99cent special rental, reason i watched the movie. it was silly, had some funny moments...it was ok. wouldn't buy it, worth renting for 99cents tho! :)"
4,Funny movie,"This movie is really growing on me. A funny, well-made comedy. John C Reilly is hysterical. The movie gets better each time I watch it."
3,Good gaming material,"Actually addresses real-world religion, respectfully. Unlike ""Charlemagne's Paladins"", however, it oddly provides no guidance with reguards to alignment or other requirements for Cleric characters (they exist, but it doesn't give any concrete rules as how to play, say, a Christian priest.) Has a lot of information on the areas and castles where the Crusaders fought, but nothing on the Europe where the Crusaders came from."
3,Brainy jam session produces few long lasting sensations,"The legendary Jazz bassist got to work with an outstanding supporting cast here, a roster offering almost intimidating expectations. Certainly those expectations do not feel reached with this mostly technically accomplished though melodically fleeting piece of work. Oozing with individual talent, Universal Syncopations is one of those sporadically brilliant, idea-driven sessions which finds these powerhouse players struggling to mesh into one cohesive union. Instead we are offered a wealth of soloing, off-kilter experimentation, and indulgent instrumental interplay, which produces mostly intriguing but incomplete compositions. When passages in certain tracks and maybe one or two whole songs themselves indicate a greater cohesion then the majority of this educated noodling suggests, we are reminded the true potency one such lineup is capable of producing."
3,It doesn't stink!,I saw the reviews for this book and decided to get it. I wasn't completely disappointed but it does lack some in depth info about networking particularly with WinNT. I took the test and almost passed the first time but didn't. The book overall is not bad but you should have other study materials as well. He does a good job of helping you understand the concepts.
5,Dependable and excellent writing in all his books,"I just finished Mr. Neals' ""Liberalism and its Discontents"" and I enjoyed it so much I thought I'd see if he could write about technical stuff as well as he writes commentary. I'm not disappointed. Although a little bit of the technical stuff was over my head, I was able to work through most of it by sitting down at the computer and following the instructions in the book. I think this one is definitely worth purchasing, especially if you want to understand Windows 98, networking and get a little commentary on the future of computers."
5,Still the best,"I've read a lot of WIndows 98 books as well as NT, TCP/IP, and other computer books. AFter reading one of the reviews here, I went back and re-read parts of this one and it still tops my list as one of the best Windows 98 books and computer books. Period. I've never seen such a clear explanation of networking in such a short space. And I've given his explanation of file systems, protocols, services and other concepts to serveral people to help them understand what I couldn't explain in my own words. I guess if you look hard enough you'll find stuff that's wrong with it, but as computer books go, this is one of the best."
5,This book helped me pass the Windows 98 exam,This book is excellent. It's accurate and well-written. I'd recommend it to anyone preparing for the MCSE. I'm sure it's the reason I passed the exam.
1,What a DISAPPOINTMENT,"I bought this book and was extremely disappointed. It missed several key points that I saw on the exam. I wouldn't have passed by using this book alone despite what the description says. It doesn't even meet all of the exam guidlines that Microsoft states. Maybe that's why it isn't Microsoft Approved. Dont' waste your time with this one, find one that is Microsoft Approved."
2,Missed Important exam info,I bought this book based upon the good reviews here and was disappointed. It lacked important exam info such as implicit and explicit permissions. Go for Microsoft Approved Study Guides. It is the only way you can be sure all exam info is covered.
5,Hands down one of the best computer books I've read....,"This author has a talent for telling it like it is, which seems to be pretty original for this genre. Reading as many books as I have about Windows, Java, HTML, etc., I have never enjoyed reading a book as much as I enjoyed reading this one. I will be first in line for Windows 2000."
5,Technical subject handled in easy to understand manner,"This book is written for those computer professionals seeking to become MCSE certified, or at least take the tests. I'm not one of those. However, I found this book to be written in such an easy-to-understand, engaging manner that this book can easily serve the needs of beginners and home users that want to know more than the superficial ""how to"" books. A great resouce."
5,A must have PMD......,"I HATE CONTEMPORARY MUSIC.....EXCEPT for this disc which is spectacular in its scope. Yep, it was my discovery of Sir Peter and I will most certainly buy more. Don't miss the 2nd review as it quite extensive, authoritative and worthy of a careful read. This disc has been out of print for MANY MANY years....and sit back and enjoy. The stereo soundstage and prodution is extremely good...no actually superlative.Paul Houston"
3,great but unreasonable price,"I think it's cool that it is only in one case,but I would recommend buying them seperate. Those two dvds together is about 37 dollars,and this one is like 87 dollars! Probably higher. Could it be because of the case? Well that case won't even fit in my dvd drawer. Very unreasonable of a price. If you like the case and are willing to pay that much money for it I'm fine with it,but I'm sticking with seasons 1&2 and season 3 seperate."
4,Great gift for any Scooby Doo fan,"We bought this product as a gift for our daughter's birthday. We've enjoyed watching all of the Scooby Doo series, and the packaging is clever. A must have for any Scooby Doo fan!"
3,Really Awesome! Except the second disc was all scratched up.....,"I love Scooby-Doo and when I saw the complete series, I had to have it. I love it! The episodes are just as awesome as when I first saw them! I would give it 5 stars if the second disc wasn't scratched.... I was so sad when my computer screen said ""skipping over damaged area"". I immediately stopped to checked the disc, and I was horrified to find it completely scratched up. I am extremely upset about this because now I can't use it! I would really like an explanation or a replacement. I don't want to send them all back, because I'm afraid it'll happen again. So sad"
2,still missing 8 episodes,"Disc 5-7 are actually from the 1976-77 scooby doo show. for some reason once again 8 episodes are missingSeason 2 (1977)17 The Curse of the Viking Lake18 Vampire Bats and Scaredy Cats19 Hang in There, Scooby-Doo20 The Chiller Diller Movie Theater21 The Spooky Case of the Grand Prix Race22 The Ozark Witch Switch23 The Creepy Cruise24 The Creepy Heap from the DeepI just dont get why Warners skipped these once again?"
3,still need season 4,"If you're a true fan of Scooby Doo then you will notice that this is not the entire series. There are 18 episodes missing from this series.Episodes:The Harum-Scarum SanitariumThe Ozark Witch SwitchSpooky Case of the Grand PrixChiller Diller Movie ThrillerThe Creepy Heap From The DeepCreepy CruiseVampires,Bats and ScaredycatsThe Curse of Viking LakeGruesome Game of the Gator GhostThe Fiesta Host is an Aztec GhostHang in There, Scooby DooHigh Rise Hair RaiserHeadless Horseman of HalloweenWatt a Shocking GhostThe Spirits of '76'Scared a Lot in CamelotThe Ghosts of the Bad Humor ManThe Ghost That Sacked the QuarterbackThese episodes are essential because they introduced us to Scooby's cousins Scooby Dum and Scooby Dee. Warner needs to do a Season 4 and add these great episodes to it. Only then will we have the entire series. I have them recorded on my DVR, but I would love to have them on DVD. Please Warner Brothers, we're waiting."
5,GREAT!,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND AND TWINS FOR CHRISTMAS. MY SON LOVES SCOOBY DOO AND WANTS TO WATCH HIM ALL THE TIME. THE MOVIES ARE GREAT AND THE MYSTERY MACHINE MAKES IT A GREAT GIFT. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THE RAILS ON TOP OF THE MYSTERY MACHINE POP OF EASILY. OTHER THAN THAT GREAT!
2,Lousy Transfer,"We LOVE these old episodes, but the transfer quality is terrible. In fact, our Scooby VHS tapes look better on our high-def system than these DVDs! It seems as though tapes were played on a standard-def TV and recorded onto the DVDs with a camcorder aimed at the monitor. Motion gives legs a ""looking-through-a-screen-door"" appearance; this loses the charm of, what had been, smooth hand-drawn images. What a shame."
1,Maybe 1 day...,"This release has been anticipated by Camel fans for quite awhile...Unfortunately, I ordered this directly thru 3ears, and even though my credit has been charged in August 2005, the people there have been consistently ignoring all requests for information.As of this writing, the item has yet to see the light of day.Truly disappointing, and simply an un-ethical business practice to take advantage of consumers."
1,Truly terrible!,"I have this book in the ""California Edition"" for a class I am taking online. It is a truly terrible book. I have even written the publisher to complain about it. It is infuriating that I had to spend about $100 on this piece of garbage. Several of the Glossaries are printed pages from websites, why would I pay for that? The chapters are mislabeled (for example Chapter 6 is incorrectly headed on each page in the chapter as Chapter 8, but the whole book is out of order like that). Misspellings and grammatical errors abound. It is poorly written and confusing. There are too many sidebars, journal prompts, reviews, figures, etc. You can't finish what you are reading without some new distraction popping up on the page. If you are a professor considering using this text for your class, PLEASE DON'T!! If I could give it no stars I would!"
1,Now you're losing your mind in no time!!!!!,"This set is absolutely horrible. I have used several different language tapes for brushing up on my Spanish. This one is not only bad, it's extremely irritating!Problem 1: The cover says that there are 2 tracks, 1 for Spanish and 1 for English. So, You choose to listen to 1, or both tracks. Wrong! No matter how I turned the dials on my stereo, I heard both tracks.Problem 2: The tracks are so rapid that it is difficult to tell what is being said.Problem 3: Each of the 4 speakers talks at a different volume level. One moment you can't hear, and the next moment your'e being screached at.Problem 4: (Last and certainly not least) An annoying high-pitched set of tones is played between EVERY section. This repeated shrill sound is enough to give you a headache! Sometimes the sections are short so you get to hear this sound after only a few phrases!Avoid this package at all costs!!!"
2,"A Review of ""Cold Dark Matter"" by Alex Brett","This novel was a disappointment; it received rave reviews from The Global And Mail and mystery-related publications, so I had high hopes, and with its science theme (astronomy) I had to give it a try. It's about the mystery behind the death of a Canadian astronomer in Hawaii. The protagonist is sent from Canada to investigate it, and she discovers there are a lot of politics and intrigue behind why he died.I stopped reading it about half the way through; it bored me. I didn't care about the mystery. The characters seemed superficial and contrived, and the story was getting silly, with too much spy-like events occuring to be credible.The Canadian author received rave reviews for their first book, Dead Water Creek, but I have my doubts about it now if it's anything like this one."
2,Disappointing,"I love Putney's historical novels, but this book fell flat. Like other reviewers, I was turned off by the constant preachy tone in regards to capital punishment. The dialogue also felt contrived and stilted. This book was lacking in humor and warmth, and I never felt an emotional connection to the main characters. In regards to the romance department, there was very little to recommend it. When I finish a romance, I like to feel as if the characters have a binding love that will stand the test of time. However, I wouldn't have been surprised if this couple broke up a month later. All around disappointing."
3,Disappointing continuation of a great universe,"After reading the past two books in this universe (Burning Point and The Spiral Path), I was thrilled to see yet another continuation. Spiral Path especially was so beautifully crafted and richly emotional; it seemed Putney was just getting better and better! But this novel disappointingly fell very flat. It was completely predictable from start to finish. At the first mention of each plot point, I knew immediately what the end result would be -- hardly the most fun way to read a mystery! I enjoyed the character of Val at first, but her emotional revelations seemed very forced.Overall, the book read like a very good sermon against the death penalty, with some romance and mystery elements thrown in as an afterthought. Not a bad read, but not at all what we've come to expect from the very talented Putney."
2,rather boring,"I snap up all of Mary Jo Putney's books, but I have to admit this might be changing in regards to her contemporary novels. This most recent one was a good example of the problems I have with her contemporary efforts. I never felt a connection to the main characters - they were rather boring and flat. There is value in reading about the love of two ordinary people, but these people were not just ordinary; they were boring. I felt that the romantic situations were a little contrived, too. I read romance novels primarily for the character development, this definitely took a backseat to the plot in this novel. Unfortunately, I didn't have much interest in the plot, either. It, too, was sort of dull and flat. In the end, I was much more interested in the story of the secondary characters than the two protagonists. I gave the book two stars, mostly because I like Mary Jo Putney in general, but I do not recommend this book to other readers."
3,A fine effort-,"If anyone other than Mary Jo Putney had written this book I would have given it more stars. After the emotional brilliance of The Spiral Path however, it seems to pale in comparison. I still give her amazing credit for dealing with harsh subjects like the death penalty, and in that respect cannot find fault with this novel. All in all there was nothing in this that would haunt me afterwards like I find in the majority of her works. The Bride series is one of the most troubling series found in historical fiction today, and this book just didn't stay with me after the first reading. I am the first to admit that I am on my second copies of many of her works, but Twist of Fate is probably my least favorite out of all of her writings."
2,Too many characters from previous books...,"I read pretty much all of Mary Jo Putney books, but I am a little disapointed in this one. This book has way too many referenced characters on her previous books that makes it a bit awkward to read. These characters just conviniencely drop into the plot and make this book very boring.I like Mary Jo Putney best when she writes Historical romances."
2,Save your dollars,"this mystery book got 2 stars because it had a decent ending, but it was so slow and painful, I'm surprised I even made it to the end. i didnt like the characters and i was especially unconvinced with their no chemistry romance. save your money, buy something else."
2,Nope.,"I thought this and the spiral bound book were the same, but they weren't. There were differences. >.> , ,"
2,WHAT HAPPENED???,Pharcyde's first two CD's are nice. This one isn't. Send FatLip to rehab and bring him back fast. Without him the group is sub-par.
1,Sad effort from what was a group with promise,"Pharcyde has been going downhill ever since their first album and it appears they have hit rock bottom with this effort. The title pretty much says it all. The raps are boring and for the most part uncreative. Very few acts have been able to do the R&B tie in with their tracks and 'Plain Rap' is certainly not one of them. They should of learned from LabCabin that their R&B ...... The beats, with exception to the remix track, sound like something a 9 year old could make with their computer. If you are looking for a great rap album go buy Bizarre Ride II. Avoid this one at all costs. Hopefuly the group will learn from their mistakes or go their seperate ways. This fan can't stand to see what they have become."
2,No life without FatLip,"I bought this being the Pharcyde-fo-life fan that I am even though my favorite member (FatLip) is no more. FatLip must have been THE Pharcyde because the lyrical content the remaining members brought...well...I mean...what lyrical content? Imani...""you can count on Pharcyde to bust"". Not exactly. Simple, meaningless rhymes. Reminds me of Phife's lackluster performance on Beats, Rhymes & Life. SlimKidTre is NOT an R&B singer, so he needs to stop. And Bootie Brown...not even memorable enough to comment on.Basically, there aren't any shining moments on this CD for me...only tracks that don't suck AS bad as some of the others. The beats were tired and even Black Thought couldn't help ""Network"".So, it would appear I'll just have to keep the Pharcyde alive in my heart with ""Labcabin..."" and ""Bizarre Ride II""."
4,it's a good kind of different,"The Pharcyde is obviously a solid group when listened to. Their lyrics are the best part of their music. But, when you listen to them you know that something different is going on, it's not just hip-hop, it's something higher. One of the things that contributes to this is thier beats: the beats are played loudly, thier original, and spliced strangely. There is a definite level of originality to this album, but it doesn't quite reach a level of greatness. It is good, very good, and very enjoyable, but not great. Still, I would buy it again if I had to."
1,I just can't bear it...,"'Network' (feat. Black Thought) is somewhat ok.With that said, the rest of this album is a heaping pile of rancid trash.These cats really need some help. With Fatlip out of the picture, there is no charisma left in the group. As for the production... *eerp*... *blurp*... ...sorry... I almost threw up..."
3,Nice,"I'm a big fan of Donna Kooler, and this one wasn't too much of a disappointment. A lot of the patterns call for quarter stitches. Since I usually stitch on vinyl weave, there are several patterns I cannot create because there's too many quarter stitches. With that being said, the patterns are very cute and not too complicated. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
4,Perfect for 1 year old,"Bought this watering can after my 13 month old was imitating his Daddy by using anything he could find to ""water"" the plants. This is a great, durable watering can that is the perfect size for a one year old to hold and manipulate. My son tends to dump all the water out at once so we tend to use imaginary water unless we're in the pool. He's 18 months now and still loves his watering can."
2,"small, junky, expensive","i bought this for my little girls birthday. it is small, junky and expensive. not quite sure why i ordered this one as i found a ton of cuter ones in stores after getting this one for a fraction of the cost. i should have just returned it if it wouldn't have ended up in the bottom of the sandbox. the kids use the cheap little dollar watering cans before this one. wouldn't recommend spending this much on this can."
3,Poor design but we still love it,About the last third of the pail will not flow out the spout even for mama and ends up being dumped out everywhere. But we still use it daily.
5,The power of simple things,"The best toys are the simplest ones. Drawing from this premise, this product is a great purchase. I bought it for my toddler who is eager to help everytime I am watering plants in the garden. It was an instant hit! It is made of durable plastic, though not rigid, does not have sharp or hard edges. The handle is very well designed for small hands, allowing for my 14 month-old daughter to have a lot of control when pouring water from it. The fact that it is not too big is also an advantage, because kids tend to fill it up completely and were it larger, my daughter wouldn't be able to carry it around when full. I suspect this watering can will be used for a long time to come."
2,Strangely Flat,"I love the rest of the books of this series, but this one falls flat and basicaly makes little sense. I had to ploww my way through it hoping for something better. Some good fight scenes at end. But Whew! the rest!"
2,Dull,This story was dull and hard to follow. I like cross time fantasy and this kind of story. Nothing made sence. There was no value added from the characters from the present.I did finish the book but it dragged and I didn't really like or care about the characters. It seemed like just some historical novle about some obscure time period. I didn't get the fell of the times the changes in culture and values. I just simply didn't get it.
4,Good Book in the series,"If you're a fan of the 163X series started by Eric Flint; several of the books have other co-authors; then you'll like the book. If you're looking for a good alternate history book, then start with the first book of the series; 1632.For fans, this is another book in Italy, and is okay. I enjoyed it, but I'm still waiting for the Baltic War book due out later this year. Grr for making us wait for that."
3,Cannon has damp powder this time,"This one telegraphs its sluggish route thru various Olde Historical Names one can cheerfully Google, to produce the slowest read in the 1632 Miniverse. I'm a pleased owner/re-reader of all other books & Gazettes, up to this one. Euterpe or the Essen Steel series would make better reads. Here's hoping The First Team does better on The Next Great '32 Novel!!"
4,A little old fashioned,The book did what i wanted it to do. I told me what temperatures to set the skillet to to cook various items. The recipes are a little old fashioned.
1,Useless,Did not even work or give any useful information. Waste of time and money. Do not buy this product at all STAY AWAY!!!!!
2,Nothing Special,"Sure, this is definitely Goa from some of the bigger names in the field such as X-Dream and Colorbox, and a lot of it, but the fact is, its still a mediocre album.The pieces played on this two-disc album present a rather similar selection of works, with the heavy influence of flangers on practically every track. Sometimes the songs were just downright obnoxious, but the album didn't appear to show many surprises or changes of importance.The mixing was done relatively well on this album by a mysterious DJ, and I'd say its good if you need deep thumping music for a background to studying, reading, etc., but is not for paying a lot of attention to."
3,"Some good, but could be better","Well, one thing's for sure: the price is right. Less than $10 for two CDs is a pretty good deal, but I still don't care for this, and I haven't listened to it since I gave it my initial listening.The main reason I don't like this collection is because the songs that are on here are also on a lot of other collections. I bought it only because it was cheap, not because I liked the tracklisting. The songs that I recognised were generally pretty good, but a lot of the lesser-known stuff wasn't.I would recommend against buying this CD. It doesn't offer enough that other compilations don't already have."
2,Very disappointed...,The songs are very redundant and sound the same after a short while. Even the tracks that hold themselves above the rest are nothing short of boring. I found myself wanting to fall asleep rather than dance.
4,ANALOG PUSSY IS ON THIS CD !,"This cd is pretty good. At times alot of the songs sound just like the other ones,but it has ANALOG PUSSY on this cd,so it can't be that bad."
3,GOOD GOA BUT NOT GOOD TRANCE,"This album is alright, it has a change in goa jungle beats to goa trance. But you should get a compilation called ""dance party"" like its 2001 instead. It has this song called ""sandstorm"" which is awesome!"
4,Plastic butt!,"What's more fun then a plastic butt at Halloween? Not much! This thing was very realistic. It's made out of hard plastic, but if you were to sit on it, you would probably crush it. There are two small strings that you tie around your waste for the butt to sit properly. I wouldn't say this product is very comfortable. I love the fact that the butt crack is deep. It definitely looks like a female buttocks, but isn't all that small. Worth the purchase."
2,Insufficient evidence,"Too much verbiage, speculation, and surmise. Too little solid evidence. The foundation for the authors' conclusions is lacking. This book has earmarks I often see in conspiracy books - multiple repetitions of certain ""facts,"" obvious objections ignored or dismissed out of hand, jumping to a conclusion when there is information to support an opposing or differing conclusion, and holding back significant information on one questionable theory or another. (Here in the interests of ""national security."") This book likely made money and may have added something to the ongoing seach for truth about the Kennedy assassination, but it isn't the final answer. I don't know when, if ever, a solid, comprehensive, determination will be made. On Nov. 22, 2010, 47 years will have elapsed since the assassination. Maybe that's long enough that all files can be opened to public scrutiny without the danger of involving well-connected living persons who had something to fear. We'll see."
2,The Mafia Killed Kennedy,"This book presents the case that Mafia Kingpins like Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante masterminded and conspired alongside ""rogue"" elements of the C.I.A to kill Pres. Kennedy. Since the Mafia and the U.S. Govt had previously worked in unison to oust or assassinate Castro, the Mafia used this sordid alliance as cover to go after the president knowing the Government would use all of its power to cover up the symbiotic relationship formed with organized crime."
2,Ultimately Bad Editing,"Too many facts, too loosely provided and a theory that just doesn't make sense. I can buy that the Mafia wanted JFK dead, and even set up Oswald for the fall, but this book doesn't present a cogent narrative to prove that point, just alot of seemingly disconnected and aimless wandering of facts. And there was really nothing new about the assassination itself that was interesting. Perhaps with some editing and streamlining, this book could have something to the overwhelming number of books and theories about the Kennedy assassination."
4,Very Interesting,"I have read alot of books regarding JFK, and I have to say that this one was very interesting."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This long-winded book contains so much unreliable information and mere speculation that it will mislead anyone but a JFK scholar. Bar none, it is the worst book I have ever read. If you want a short book with lots of discredited information, just go with Sy Hersh's The Dark Side Of Camelot. I can't believe Thom Hartmann put his name on this dreck."
2,Very detailed,I found this book to be very difficult to read due to all of the detail and repeated comments and side issues that I'm sure were important to the authors but I don't need. I can't question the accuracy of the information as there are a host of references but I would have preferred it to be condensed from the 800 pages to half that.
5,Deja Vu all over again....,"Why is it that, every time a great Kennedy assassination book comes out, the Posner people have to come out and trash them [without reading them , of course]?? Instead of Orwell's 1984, it feels like 1993 all over again....Hartman and Waldron have come up with a brilliant tome in 'Ultimate Sacrifice-John and Robert Kennedy, the Plan for a Coup in Cuba, and the Murder of JFK' While I hesitate to say that it is the very best book on this complicated subject, I will go so far to say that it is already in my top 5 of all time ('Bloody Treason' by Twyman is a very hard act to follow)Do yourselves a favor-actually buy and ***read**** the book. Like someone else said below, ignore all of those that would dismiss this book out of hand. That should tell you something; namely, the authors are very much on the right track.Zane Hallena very impressed reader:)"
3,Tons of research...lots of information regarding the influencers and events contributing to JFK's murder,"This is a tough slog, I actually had to draw out 5 different charts to keep me straight on which group was which, inside the different government agencies who consipired against JFK. The authors did lots of research over the years but the writing style is heavy reading and not for anyone looking for an easy book to sail through catching yet another facet in the grand puzzle. Three recent books that are a great read are: ""Dr. Mary's Monkey"" and ""Me and Lee"" and ""Mary's Mosaic"". Anyone interested in JFK would enjoy these, and I suggest you read the first two in that order, as they are closely related stories."
1,Don't Bite,"Complete and total disinformation. 17 years spent on this book? Why, because so many CIA Department Heads changed during that time?If you wish to remain a laughable dunce who never gets any dates -- then please stay in Posner-land. If you wish to rejoin reality, spend your next 1,000 pages of JFK reading on Joan Mellen's ""Farewell to Justice"" and Gerald McKnight's ""Breach of Trust"".Shame on Thom Hartmann. No more of his radio show for me, the liberal geek."
1,Don't buy this disinformation,This book is disinformation. It is an attempt to discredit serious critics of the Warren Commission and confuse everyone else. DON'T BUY THIS TRASH. This is your tax dollars at work.
4,Drum N' Bass no more ...,"John Coxon and Ashley Wales gradual nine year transformation from electronic duo to electro-acoustic improvisational unit finds it's apotheosis in this album. Featuring legendary guest trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith and saxophonist Evan Parker, Spring Heel Jack have created a sound environment both subtly dissonant yet achingly beautiful.While the guest improvisors are old school free jazzers, the leaders of this session come from a background more firmly rooted in contemporary pop music. The resulting combination yields an album rich in horn-based interplay, with a melodic and structural foundation that is as richly textural as it is nostalgically bittersweet. There is a sense of buried musical traditions in the organ chords, samples and feedback that add a level of emotional depth rarely heard in modern improvisational meetings like this. A summit meeting for the times, perhaps their most mature and impressive album to date."
3,video quality poor,"I assume if you're buying this, you know what you're getting. What the other reviews don't mention is that this is a poor quality video. Granted, you don't expect a silent film to look like last week's Tom Hanks favorite, but my copy of this product looked like it had been through an x-ray machine.No subtitles on Un Chien (though you don't really need them).Hope this helps you make you're purchase decision."
3,Fun but hardly a masterpiece,"Un Chien Andalou has a number of startling images - which amount to nothing as they do not mean a thing and were not meant to. It would be a mere curiousity from 1928 except that Bunuel discovered that you could provoke hilarity by editing two images together which were not related. The resulting lack of linearity is the basis for much of Monty Python's humor. It is an anarchic sense of humor - daring to challenge the need for a punchline. In order for it to work, you need some unusual situations and images. This film has them in abundance. A creative little film. Clever, but hardly anything that could be called a masterpiece. Note that it is only a few minutes long."
3,surrealism at the expense of...,"un chien andalou is a brilliant surreal piece of work by bunuel and the great dali. the part i have a problem with however is the second film on this tape, ""land without bread"". i don't buy into the idea that bunuel actually gave a rip about these people in spain but merely used and exploited them in probably the most warped faux documentary i have ever seen. if his supposed genius was in some way going to make me say, ""wow, that was a brilliant piece of surreal work and caught in a documentary style that made me feel empathy for these poor destitude people"". that isn't what i got out of it. complete trash. and for those of you that look at ""land without bread"" as a masterpiece of cinematic surrealism, go get your 8mm video cam and take a trip to some third world country and film them in all their poverty and disease and come back tell me that was a moving and artistic moment for you. no redeeming social value what so ever... death to bourgeoisie!"
4,Great and inventive way of using magic,"This book as a great book when it concerns a creative and new way of using magic. Instead of the not too much used or ""basic"" wizards, a game master can do a lot of new ideas from this book. Also the story line is not hard to get into. Lots of times you come to points that you don't want to go to sleep but want to read on to see what will happen next. I don't want to spoil a lot of the book, but to my opinion the maze chapters where the best."
3,....another average Thieves' World adventure....,"I love swords & sorcery. I love thieves & assassins. But, as usual, i'm let down. As a novel, it's just average. The thievery and the swords are barely in here. The dungeon crawl parts are pretty bland. I can't really recommend this unless you really liked the Thieves' World series."
4,Scottish history at its best.,This is a wonderful historical novel of The Scottish Nation and I loved the way the historical facts blended in a wonderful and easily read storie line. Not to be missed by anyone who loves to read about Scottish history. A+
2,Not what I thought it would be,"As a musician, I have gotten a lot of musical related things for my nearly 8 month old son. When I saw Baby Einstein, World Music, and it had a 3+ months in the bottom corner, I bought it right away. I was excited to watch this with my son. I think I sat there for the first 10 minutes, trying to get my sons attention, waiting for the fun music to start, before I realized that it had actually started 10 minutes ago. The music is so mellow, that it might be the perfect music to have in the back ground for my son to fall asleep to.This DVD is not what to get, if you are looking for something fun, with good beats, to dance and play with your baby.If you are looking to show your baby animals from different countries, and some people, and some mellow music to try to calm them down before they go to bed, then maybe this product is for you.I gave it two stars, because in between the little segments, he did like the little puppet shows."
1,wow this is terrible,"Watered-down, dumbed-down, sanitized music. I know that's Baby E's m.o. for the most part but come on. Not only is the music bad, the choice of images is also boring. I will not subject my toddler to this again. Yikes."
5,baby einstein,"This was given as a gift, the parents totally enjoyed watching with the little one. :-)They said it was a great addition to the others they have.Baby Einstein dvd's and cd's are perfect for babies and older children. The music and the colors really hold their attention."
1,Boooring,"I purchased this video hoping to find joyful music from the world: polkas, tango, mariachis, african music.But you can't find any of those.The dvd is a collage of images with music composed by the baby einstein musicians, which doesn't represent the Music of the world.It is very boring. My children, who are the Baby Einstein biggest fans hardly look at it.Dissapointing."
2,Blah,I thought this video was going to be great since my son loved the world of rythem so much but after two mintues in his attention was else were. Real Let down.
1,Misbehaving and Mean Puppets,"This video has some beautiful cinematography. The music is pretty, but sometimes doesn't match the country that is being shown. My biggest problem with this video involves the misbehaving puppets. In one segment, one puppet steals the other puppet's hat and runs away. In another segment, one puppet has more fruit on its head so the other puppet pushes her. I think these puppets are modeling bullying behavior."
4,very comfortable chair,"This is wonderful chair. There is nothing more comfortable than the zero gravity design. My husband is 6'-3"" so I bought the XL model with him in mind but my daughter (4'-11"") and I find it comfy and easy to operate, too. Beware though, the ""white"" is definitely beige, more like the color of a manila file folder."
1,ehhh?,"Im super small so I got this thinking it will make my life soooo MUCH easier learning how to just make my own stuff.. uh yeah, I was sad once I seen all the options of bras and panties in this thing.. SOOOOO old fashion would be a nice way to put it..If your younger and wanting to make something cute dont get it."
5,a good read and good instructions,"This book was very well priced, and easy to understand. I love that it comes with all the patterns in there, while some of the underwear is a bit dated its still something that you can wear today. the pictures are great. all in all a great book"
3,Kwik sew beautiful lingerie,"Thank you. I thought there would be an opportunity to be able to draft a step by step instruction for a basic pattern for your own shape, giving you the challenge to make your own fitted lingerie and follow the make up instructions therein in the book. This would have been a gem. Cheers!"
3,Buying used,This book was in fine shape but I did not realize it should of had patterns included in it for lingerie. I should of had the patterns for the class I took. These patterns were missing because this was a used item. So if you need the patterns either make sure the used book has them or buy a new book. This was probably not apparent to the dealer as it was to me.
3,Not a dull moment!,"Chris Brenner and company's latest release, ""The Promise of an Uncertain Future"", is overflowed with enough harmonies, playful lyrics, humor, and punked-out guitar riffs that leaves not a dull moment behind. With a sound reminiscent of bands like Blink-182, MxPx, Samiam, and Descendents, this band can stir up any audience with a delightful sing-a-long to it's catchy trend. Tracks to check out most definitely are ""Picture Perfect"", ""Pieces"", ""Day Off"", ""Board Games"" and ""Living on a Couch""."
5,Perfect Timing!,"Exactly what was ordered. And the item arrived before the date it was supposed to arrive, which was great!! Thanks!"
2,REPRINT of Play Poker Like the Pros. Don't buy both.,I foolishly bought both these books seeing I could get a discount if I bought both. I got them separately in the mail and thought they accidentally sent me two of the same book. Yes they are that similar. I will in the long haul probably benefit from the material in both but think that it should be boldly advertised that most of the material is directly copied from the original book.
1,WORTHLESS,Being a good poker player does not make you a good author. If you know anything at all about texas holdem you will be disappointed with this book. Nothing but cookie cutter advice and bragging about being the best poker player in the world.
1,Phil is just being Phil,"Phil obviously knows a lot about Texas Hold'em, he just doesn't share much if it in this book. If you think Phil is the smartest man on earth and devour anything he touches, then you'll love this book. He does a great job of pointing out situations where his brilliant intellect helped him win past tournaments. Unfortunately, he fails to deliver on the purpose of the book, helping US play better. It appears to me that he wrote it while on a long flight, the morning before his publisher's deadline. Don't bother with this one."
1,This is a REPRINT,This is a good book IF you don't own the book it is a condensed version of. This is NOT a new book.
2,Brat,"I found this to be somewhat useful, poorly written however and the book measures about 6 inches tall by 4 inches wide. Very small print, very small package. You have to respect Phil, but you find your own poker opinions quickly at odds with that of the poker brat."
4,"A very good, but uneven book","I first considered giving this book 5 stars, but then decided 4 would be more appropriate. The book is written in a clear and easy to read style, with some drawings and photographs. The first half of the book covers low/unknown risk stops, and the second half focuses on high risk stops.The first half is exellent, and contains a lot of very useful information (several ways to overcome the problem of tinted windows, for example). The second half is not so good, and the book gets a bit repetitive towards the end. However, the tactics in this book are realistic and simple enough to remember even in a high stress situation. And there is a lot more information you would expect to find in a book of a little over 100 pages."
4,Advanced Vehicle Stop!,"This is a good book. It clearly tells you how to do a safe vehicle stop and the different approaches/sides you can do it and also how to do it safly. You have some good tips. It covers approaching an SUV, car, Trucks and Busses. The tactics are good. The book also cover high risk stops which cover Verbal commands, Moving occupants from Vehicle, Clearing the vehicle (not SWAT style), Clearing the trunk. Like someone elses was saying it get littlebit repetely against the end but a clearly 4 star it is."
4,From a True Beginner,"My husband and I have both used and enjoyed this video even though neither of us has ever tried yoga before. We're both in our fifties, and we found all of the stretches and exercises very possible to do. The stress relief is immediate, and the feeling of calm well-being after finishing it is very nice."
3,Great For Beginners,Informative and excellent video for the yoga beginner. My only complaint is that the quality of the video is quite poor. Even with the advanced tracking systems in most vcr's this one is still very grainy.
3,Same tape as Lilias Alive with Yoga,"This tape is actually quite a good beginner's yoga tape. Lilias is a calm, assured, knowledgeable instructor.However, I gave this product only 3 stars because this tape has exactly the same content as this one:Lilias! Alive with Yoga: BeginnerIt has a different title and different packaging, but is exactly the same tape.I already had Alive with Yoga, and am very disappointed that I purchased a duplicate copy that was packaged as if it were completely different material. I'll be giving this tape away as a gift."
5,Schwartz's favorite!,"Chilren of Eden is a beautiful retelling of the story of creation, and also of the story of the demolition of creation through Noah's flood.The music is not necessarily easy to listen to, it's not catchy, it's not fun. But it is intellegent, it is honest and beautiful. I think this is some of Stephen Schwartz's best work.The cast is composed of an inter-racial group of people who's voices blend together and are very charming.I didn't expect to like Stephanie Mills much in a Broadway type setting, but she really is very good.I reccomend this CD if you like to think. If you are intellegent, or if you are looking for a different perspective on Genises, listen to this soundtrack!"
4,Raybestos makes pretty good stuff,I have been using this brake pad set for several weeks and so far there is no noise from the brakes. I'm satisfied.
2,Out of date - misleading information (2001 version),"While this travel guide is quite valueable for some content, it is sufficiently out of date as to be questionable for many items. My wife and I just returned from Paris. We used this guide successfully for some items, but the version we have --- 2001 --- has misleading information about musuem times. We actually got kicked out of our tour of the Louvre (and did not get to see the Mona Lisa) because the tour book said that the Louvre was open late on Mondays and Wednesays - NOT TRUE anymore.If you use this book, verify the information BEFORE you make your plans (sort of makes the book worthless in this sense as a trip builder)."
5,good variety,This DVD provides a good variety of workouts. I love the upper body workout and the cardios.
3,Should have rented it first!,"I absolutely love Karen Voight's style and I own several of her exercise videos/DVDs. When I first read about this DVD, I thought it would be great...a chance to work out with Karen every day! I typically have only half an hour to work out each day, and it's challenging to find a KV workout that isn't 45 minutes to an hour long. While this DVD isn't terrible, I don't reach for it much. The cover description leads you to think you will be doing a different 30 minute workout every day, that is not the case. Most of the segments are repeated each day, and that got old fast. I also didn't care for the yoga segments, I'd much rather do Karen's Yogasculpt video. So, if you think you might be interested in this DVD...take my advice and RENT IT FIRST."
4,"good work outs, but there could be more to it","The daily workouts a good. It is great to have them in bite-sized pieces so that you can add or subtract from any given day. The yoga is challenging. The cardio is not exactly over-the-top, and the strength training loses its challenge after a while. Oevrall, however, I'd say it is an excellent tool to have around. Each 30-minute session will leave you feeling as though you've done something for the day, and because they only take 30 minutes, they are relatively easy to fit into a busy day."
2,Repeat product!,"If you have the Karen Voight video titled ""Burn and Firm"" Circuit Training - don't bother with this product. It is the same thing!!! Burn & Firm is a great work out and what Slim Physique does is breaks down Burn & Firm by taking different segments of it and having you do part of it each day for 30 minutes. For example - on Monday you will do the lower body workout - on Tuesday you may do the upper body workout. Both of these are directly from Burn & Firm which you can break down by yourself. The only new thing on this DVD is the yoga - which I'm guessing is from one of her other DVDs. I was greatly disappointed with this purchase. If you don't have Burn & Firm, this tape will give you a good workout - just don't buy both."
4,A Good Workout - But Not Karen's Best!,"I bought this video with the impression that there were varying workouts. I was disappointed that there is really only 1 cardio section that is repeated throughout. Also the workouts are not for the more advanced exerciser...more beginner to intermediate. Nevertheless, as always, Karen Voight is a great instructor...she is articulate and precise. The workout is good for variation but, being more advanced, these workouts would not be fulfilling enough for everyday!"
3,Not as described on the label,"The label says ""a different 30-minute workout each day"". Well, no, it's not. There are different combinations for each day, but, the segments are the same for several of them. Gets pretty boring fast. Glad I rented before plunking the money down to buy it. I like that she gets down to the exercises quickly without a lot of idle chitchat, but the intro of the person exercising with her should be done in the explanation section, so you don't hear it every single time for each workout.Too bad, as the concept is a GREAT one, and with the storage capacity of DVDs today, you could have one with perhaps a month of different 30-minute workouts, 5 days a week.Hope she reads these comments and comes out with a new DVD with really different workouts for each day. If this one goes on deep discount one of these days I may buy it, but otherwise not, as you're really at most getting one hour of different exercises."
4,not as much variety as expected,"Although I certainly don't consider myself advanced, I thought these workouts were a bit lacking for cardio. Also, since I've never been very coordinated, it took me a few times to get some of the moves down - this didn't bother me because too much instruction can get annoying once you've used a tape a few times. The abdominal, lower body & upper body are still good and I'll continue to use them. Her counterpart, Kathy, has good form and does all the moves as instructed, but her smile is too fake and continuous - it's pretty annoying in fact. Voight needs to get someone else on other videos."
3,Don't buy if you already own Burn & Firm,"I was so anxious to try these routines, only to find out that most of the DVD is actually a remix of Karen Voight's BURN & FIRM workout, which I already own and have been doing for years. There was nothing written about ""Slim Physique"" to indicate that was the case. Even the pictures on the DVD case are nothing like what is actually on the DVD. Otherwise, the routines are fantastic. I just wanted to tell anyone who already owns BURN & FIRM, this DVD is not for you."
3,"good work-out, but repetitions disappointing","I bought this DVD thinking that it would have a new routine for each day of the week and was completely disappointed that the same work-outs are repeated. I don't think this was mentioned in the video description or on the container, so that bothered me, too. But the work-outs are challenging and it still is a good alternate to my usual tapes. I just keep hoping that someone will produce the ""perfect"" work-out video, but this isn't it."
5,Slim Physique,"I have a lot of Karen Voight tapes. She is very articulate and entuziastic trainer which helps a lot. Most of her tapes including this one for the ""advance beginners"". Yoga part (on this tape)is difficult and you should be really flexible to do that. Aerobic part is challenging, but doable. The most I like Monday & Thursday parts which I do very often. I add 5 min abs routine and feel very good."
3,"acceptable, but scratched in middle","This dvd came in a decent amount of time. But the dvd itself was damaged and skips one part of the movie. besides that, ok product."
2,Another Disney Disappointment,"Lately Disney has been unable to produce a decent movie that doesn't have the PIXAR name attached to it. I love all the Pixar films, but Princess and the Frog is another reminder of why Disney needs Pixar so much!!! I felt like the movie had some good moments, but I would have to say the Voo-doo magic and villianous moments ruined the movie for me. This is supposed to be a children's movie targeting young girls, but I don't feel it is at all appropriate for young children to watch. I am quite surprised Disney would produce this and market it to kids given how much the movie entertains the dark magic theme. I am disappointed in the story development, lack of good songs, fear factor for children, and would never consider this a great film."
1,Didn't have enough time to watch,2 days is too little for my busy schedule to watch or stream this rental before it expired on me.
3,The Princess and the Frog,This is a bias movie that depicts people of color in a negative light. I bought it to see exactly what was the content as well as the dialog of the story.
1,One of Disney's worst mistakes.,"Disney needs to get a grip on the ""darkness"" they put into children's movies. Glad we rented before we poured any money into a DVD/BlueRay.Worst hour+ of our lives that we'll never get back. My youngest was crying and even my older youngin's left the room. Now I have to explain what voodoo is?No thanks!!!"
2,Not for kids under 8 years old,"The voodoo in this bugged me, very dark and sinister, too dark for kids under 8 in my opinion. The story is ok but not to my liking and i typically like Disney stuff. Watch it first and make the judgment yourself before putting your kids in front of it."
1,Not As Advertised,"I purchased this item thinking I would receive the ENGLISH version, as it was advertised. Instead I received a bi-linqual edition (Spanish and English)."
2,Not very appropriate,"I watched this movie during the weekend and did not expect it the way it is. The interaction of the frog stories is very cute and the whole idea of a princess having to kiss a frog to make him human again. However, this story is about Voodoo magic and it is something a lot of kids will not understand and are going to become frightened when they see several images as the movie goes along. Besides the scary images (which also include showing the bad guy walking around and a completely different image of its shadow against the walls) there is also references to Satan as the Shadow Man mentions during several occasions his 'master' (or something like that).I would not buy this movie to any kid. I strongly recommend an adult to watch it first before showing it to a kid. I do not think Disney should have gone to the extremes with the Voodoo and black magic stuff."
2,Not what I expected VERY demonistic,"I was SO excited when this movie came out. I was equally disappointed with it. It has adorable story line in a sense of the main character and her family and her dreams. I think there is more to Louisiana then voodoo though, Maybe I am wrong but I know if I lived there I would want to be better represented. They have a dark sense about in this movie,, There is the evil guy who is into voodoo and witchcraft, he sings a song about ""having friends on the other side"" what other side? hmmm. Also there is dancing voodoo dolls and spirits that go after the princess frog and prince frog. Really dark I feel.. It is too bad, they could have done more for such an anticipated film. I wont be buying this one. I know all Disney movies have some form of magic, I understand that but this particular one took it way beyond and back."
2,disappointed to say the least,I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought it was very dark and evil in some parts. My 7 year old said that this was the scariest cartoon he had ever seen. Our movie is put away and selling it on amazon.com looked like a good idea from a different reviewer.
3,A 7 year old boy will watch it once,"Within 15 minutes of watching this, he said that this is a movie for girls. But he sat through it. He did not want to see it again. We sold it on ebay."
5,Great price!,Item took a little longer than I expected for delivery (2 weeks) I am very satisfied and will do business again! I have ordered over 10 games with them and have been very happy!
5,My Favorite,When there is nothing else on I can always count on this movie to cheer me up We live in Louisiana I love the scenes from N O and the music over all My fav. movie
5,Disney magic is back,"I was so happy to see this film... even if a little late. I loved it, just a great classic Disney film. The visuals are gorgeous... the hand animation looks stunning. The story is great, music catchy, and the film moves along and does not stop. It is a wonderful film."
2,Definitely NOT one of Disney's best,"This was definitely not one of Disney's best. It lacked the humor and originality that all the older Disney movies used to have. I would have said that this is good enough quality for your young kids to enjoy it, but I would not suggest any pre-teens watch it because of it's extensive dark undertones that would frighten young ones."
4,"I loved it but,....","This movie was good with the exception that majority of the movie, Princess Tiana spent it as a frog. She never got her chance to shine as a true princess. Disney dropped the ball in that aspect. It is so sad that their one and only African American princess did not span across the movie platform as a human princess in all of her beautiful dark skinned glory."
3,IT WAS OKAY,My nieces made me watch this one by manacling me to the chair. Just kidding. ;) Heh. There's some good lines that actually made me laugh a couple of times and the music is fairly good to good if you like musicals. The villain didn't seem to properly overlap with the heroes though so at times it felt like there were two stories taking place. Themes of romantic love are rampant. MY GRADE: B minus (B if you love musicals).
5,Ok,We love that Disney finally created an African-American princess. I think the voodoo character and scene in the movie is so unnecessary and is NOT kid friendly. I don't understand why Disney feels it necessary to put such evil in a kids movie. I love the Tiana and Nevin characters. I bought this DVD so that I could fast forward the evil voodoo scenes.
5,Great story,This fairytale is such a good story. It has been as popular with our adult daughter as it is with out two young grandsons ages 2 and 5. Disney movies always tell an important lesson and rarely have I been disappointed in giving them as gifts. They are fun entertainment for the adults too.
2,Disney Interns Project?,"This is by far the most disappointing Disney movie I have seen. The animation, story and acting all lack creativity, polish and originality. My wife and I are big fans of animation and this was a big disappointment for us both. It felt much like a direct to DVD sequel of another movie but it wasn't. Disney had actually released this in theaters but it had a very short run. The film is available on NetFlix now and is hardly worth the time. The drawing in the animation felt rushed and unfinished. The story was a mixture of something classic with a modern twist but very poorly executed. It might pass for the youngest of minds but even then, it's a bit to frightening for young children, and for older kids it's certainly not the best of the bunch."
4,Another great Disney Film,"We're big fans of animation for Disney and this was a very good hand-drawn animated feature. However the music was not as good as many of the ""classics"", and that was the only thing I'd say it really lacked. Besides that, we all really enjoyed it."
5,Great movie,As a father of a young girl I end up watching my fair share of movies about princesses. This movie is by far the best I have seen. The story is such a refreshing departure from the princess who passively waits for her price to come solve all her problems. This girl makes her own dreams come true! Thoroughly entertaining!
5,A New Disney Classic!,"I was hopeful, but not necessarily set on this movie being like the classic Disney blockbusters from back when I was a kid. I was completely blown away by the entire thing! The script is great, the story line and characters are enchanting, and the songs are top notch! I am glad to see Disney putting their heart back into great storytelling. Note to caregivers: The movie, like all great Disney cartoons, has its dark spots. The ""bad guy"" is truly bad, and his solo song is creepy for little kids. My kids watch it all the time now, but it was a little much at first. That being said, I would still buy it again and again!"
4,"Great movie, very slow receiving.","I brought this movie for my god daughter's birthday. The movie is wonderful and my family is still enjoying it. My only problem, I was hoping it would arrive before her birthday, non the less its a great movie."
4,This movie was good but not magical..,This was a good movie but kinda predictable. It didn't have that magical feeling like Disney's old movies.
3,Just Okay,"While I enjoyed some of the characters (the frazzled firefly, Tiana, the rich girl), this was not my favorite Disney movie. A little scary with all the voodooisms, and no memorable song.It was funny at times, and a little bit romantic, although it never quite explained why Tiana fell in love with the Prince.Oh well. I may be getting too old to expect much from cartoons.Nice to see a Black princess though."
3,The Princess and the Frog,A little dark at times with the whole voodoo element-which is too badThe music is fabulous and the overall premise of the movie is good
3,Wasn't really huge on this,"I saw this in theater with a couple of young girls. I personally was not intrigued, though I am a grown adult, but still the story just wasn't that captivating and it was weird. The combination of voodoo and whatever else, it just didn't strike me as a particularly compelling story. And I did want the weird magic nonsense to be over. I found it uncomfortable only because I found it very uninteresting. The girls didn't find the story overly interesting and have not asked to watch it since. Bolt is a movie that has more replay value."
1,bad review,I ordered THE PRINCESS & THE FROG on DVD. I received it in pretty good time but it is messed up bad. It keeps going all over the place & restarting to the beginning of the movie. I emailed the seller & have gotten no reply!! BROKEN-BAD DVD & no help! sad
2,"More frog, less princess","Disney finally decides to do a princess movie where the lead character is a black female, but they purposefully choose a story where the character spends as little time as possible being black on screen. I timed it. She spent about 20 minutes of the movie as a black girl and the rest of the time she was a green frog.Typical. I expected nothing less from Disney."
2,....A Flop....,....This Film Did'nt Even Return It's Budget In U.S Ticket Sales...I Think We All Know Why..!....It Made It's Money Overseas Where More Open Minds Prevail..!
1,Worst Disney Movie Ever,"The voodoo in this movie gave me the creeps, and I'm an adult! I will not be letting my daughter see this movie and I definitely wouldn't call it a 'kid's movie.' Having the story set in New Orleans should have been interesting (especially the music, one would think) but instead it was just plain terrible. It would be difficult to identify what the worst part of the movie was: the satanic themes, the scary shadows and death scene (not fit for young children!), the painfully slow plot development, the obnoxious poorly written songs, the incredibly boring dialogue, the stereotypical characters (which I'd imagine could be offensive to some), the lame prince, or just the overall bad experience. Will definitely never see it again or recommend it to anyone. The highlight of the movie was when the firefly shot out of a person's nose. Seriously."
1,"Terrible Movie. Boring. Annoying Characters, Makes Mulan look good.","Terrible movie. Besides a couple of ""ok"" songs the rest is horrible. One of the worst movies Disney has ever put out. This is pure crap that makes even makes Mulan look good. Even using this movie in the same sentence as the Little Mermaid or Lion King is a disgrace."
5,Disney Renaissance II,"Wow! Everytime I watch this movie something new comes out. Its is such a fantastic movie. The music is great, the characters are well drawn and move fluidly, and its not too long or too short. I strongly recommend checking it out!"
5,Having lived in New Orleans and traveled Louisiana adds to my delight,"About thirty years ago , i lived in greater New Orleans (Kenner , near Jefferson Downs horse race track) and delivered food products all over the state . Simply put , i love everything about Louisiana and it's people , food , music , history , culture , cities , towns , traditions and so on . I really like films set in and around the state as well . This film is not exempt . I think time will be very kind to this wonderful film and all its various facets and participants . A beautiful picture for young and old . Not even the melting pot that is New york could be as diverse and interesting as ""The Planet Of New Orleans"" as Mark Knopfler might suggest in said tune ."
3,spooky,fun spooky a little to much for young child in my opinion with dark magic and light magic making witchery something good
2,Regretting the rental,"The movie trailer says, ""I the spirit of the Disney classics,"" but I would argue this Disney film is in a class all it's own--the strange. My kids we hunkered down under a blanket in fear during the Voodoo scenes more than they were happily enjoying our family movie night. This is one we will not be renting again."
4,"Great, but could have been Amazing","I like this movie and my 4yr old has watched it maybe 25 times! I love the work ethic Tiana has, also how she influences the prince and goes after her dreams. I like the jazz playing and the New Orleans setting and hope it will bring more tourism back to Louisiana. I think this movie could have been so much better if it was done in brighter colors. After seeing all the recent movies in CGI it felt a little out of date. I wish Tiana had more airtime as herself and not the frog and I wish she had more songs to herself."
5,Watched this movie three times.,Fantastic!!! The characters were charming and very lifelike. The animation was excellent and the story line was captivating! I would highly suggest this movie to anyone.
3,Okay-ish,"My daughter enjoyed this movie but didn't appreciate the parts with the dark spirits - rather uncalled for, or could have been depicted less ""dark side""."
5,Great Jazzy Disney Movie!,Got the movie for my wife because she's always wanted it. Saw it for the first time and thought it was a great comedic twist on a classic tale.
3,Princess Tiana deserves a better storyline!,"I love the animation that was done in the film, and the New Orleans infused storyline. To me, Disney has needed an African American princess for some time. However, why does she have to be a frog for half the film? I think Disney would have been better off taking a Cajun culture fairytale and bringing it to life in a movie. That way the New Orleans flavor could be still infused into the storyline. All of the other Disney princesses, except Mulan, were princesses in their own right and didn't have to kiss a frog to do so. Disney has issues creating princesses that aren't white."
5,Give it a watch!,"Many reviews are long, so I'll keep mine short. The Princess and The Frog is a fantastic Disney movie. : There are adorable characters - Tatiana, Loni, Ray, the Alligator, and even the Prince is amusing to me. Setting is great, full of color,sparkle, and life. It made me want to visit New Orleans. :) The plot is sufficient - deep enough for adults to read between the lines, and simple enough for children. There are a few ""scary"" parts, but most Disney movies have them.After all, we've already had (just a few listed):-- Be Prepared - Mufasa - Lion King-- Poor Unfortunate Souls - Ursala - The Little Mermaid-- Hell Fire - Frodo - The Hunchback of Notre DameThe bottom line - it's a cute, enjoyable movie with elements of adult humor within. : Worth watching."
2,What is up with the voodoo?,"I love all Disney films so I was surprised that I walked away from this movie with a bad taste in my mouth. I hated all the voodoo scenes and ended up fast forwarding through those parts. Despite that I could swear I saw the witch doctor make a deal with the devil (or as he called it with his ""friends on the other side"") in exchange for the townspeople's souls. Then at the end when he didn't succeed in capturing the prince am I wrong or did they take his soul in payment? I found that just utterly awful. At the end of the movie my four year old didn't want to walk down the hallway to bed by himself because ""the monsters from the movie"" might get him. And that was just from what he saw on fastforward. I agree with the one reviewer, this movie is way too dark.I have no idea what Disney was thinking. They should have candy coated the bad guy way more. We won't ever be watching this movie again."
2,A little to satanic for me,"This had SUCH great potential for a great movie. The characters were cute, storyline was creative....why did we have to bring satan into it? There was an EXTREMELY scarry scene where the prince makes a ""blood pact"" with the devil in order to find true love. They actually show him pricking his finger and FEEDING the blood to a statue. Umm....all I can say is wow. And people are comparing it to the ""evil"" in other disney movies. NO WAY. This is actual satanic rituals being played out on a children's movie. I bought it without seeing it first...and now my copy is for sale at Amazon.com. The only reason it gets a 2 out of 5 for me...was because it was the closest thing to a good Disney fairy tale we have had in a long time. Wish we could have left the devil out of it."
2,Much Too Dark For Children And Adults,"I love that 'black' Americans/African-Americans have their own princess, but this movie is too dark. As an adult, I found it too scary especially since there was a snake involved and she is a frog for a long period of time. There's also voodoo! I don't recommend this movie to anyone. It's just not like the other ones."
1,Not for Children,"Ever since my 3 year old daughter saw the first preview for this movie she has asked at least once per week if she could watch it. I rented it on release day, and thankfully decided to watch it by myself first just to make sure it was age appropriate. This movie is way to disturbing for children. The demons that the Voodoo doctor calls forth from the ""other side"" would give any child nightmares. I would not recommend this movie for any age group."
2,A very dark movie,"I was excited for my little girl to see this movie, but was greatly disappointed. The movie has alot of very dark magic, not the cute disney magic but dark and evil and scary. (They had to get blood from the prince for the magic to work, and they brought back spirits from the dead.) My daughter got scared and had a hard time understanding the movie. The princess part of the movie was cute, but almost half the movie was the evil magic. We will not be watching this movie again."
2,awful....,"We let our 4 & 5 year old children watch this movie and were SO DISAPPOINTED! The obvious problem is that the princess/prince spend most of the movie as frogs, but that was no big deal. However, it could have been a very cute movie and was not. The worst part of this movie was the highly offensive ""shadow man and his demons,"" constant references to the dark side/demons as well as all the voodoo references that were not appropriate for young children. I also didn't appreciate the New Orleans/LA stereotypes and I am not even from LA. Our 4yo was scared. With each evil scene, we assumed/hoped it was the last, but this theme continued through the entire movie. We are accustomed to the ""evil"" plots of most Disney movies. There is always at least one evil character in each one. However, this movie takes it to the extreme. This is a very disappointing Disney movie. Don't waste your money. I only gave two stars for the animation. That was good....the rest awful."
1,"I am Black, and from New Orleans. What is this crap?","Thank God I watched this on Netflix, because I wouldn't ever waste money on this. What a horrible way to advertise New Orleans with Voodoo. And why do most of the characters reference Creole food and how you should eat it? Who cares! I guess this was Disneys finger to their first African American Princess movie. The Art is half-assed and Sloppy. The Character design is not even creative the princess looks like Belle from Beauty and the Beast, and the rest of the characters were drawn by an artist who had a hangover. I mean c'mon if you wanted to make a movie to piss off the African American community just make one about Hurricane Katrina."
1,Not child's play!,"I took my one year old son to see this and we ended up walking out. There was voodoo magic and tarot cards which are NOT only against our beliefs, but I believe not something to be showing children (and encouraging) either. Voodoo is a real religion that curses people, and causes much misfortune. It is ironic that the cure for their being led astray by voodoo is to try and seek another voodoo witch... Very, very disappointing. I had a lot higher hopes, as others said, for Disney's first black princess. How about we give the AA community a black woman to look up to, not one that is making critical mistakes!"
4,Excellent story with old school hand drawn animation,"It's nice to see Disney not give up on hand drawn animation even with the Pixar domination today. In fact, Pixar chief John Lassiter is executive producer on this film. Along with ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"", a stop motion puppet style film proves that it really is the story that counts, not technical gravitas. This must be Disney's umpteenth story involving princesses and/or princes, yet the plot movies along and has the usual strong moral imperative. Some nice voice acting and a strong musical score and a few memorable songs set the movie apart from the usual fare."
3,I wanted to like this more than I did,"Always interested in what Disney releases next, I was hoping to really enjoy this movie. But, I can't quite put my finger on just what was 'wrong' and didn't enjoy it as much as some of the 'classics.' The alligator was wonderful. I didn't really care for the villian (not that I am supposed to care for him...)but didn't like the character at all."
2,They should learn from Hayao Miyazaki,"Well the movie is not memorable at all i personally was looking forward to it but it made me question if i grew out of desney's charm so i popped in Mulan and found out that the movie was great, yet i told my self maybe the others are like the princess and the frog so i watched hunchback it was also great, so i threw the frog in the swamp of soulless DVD's then i saw Ponyo i wish i didn't know that cyrus and jonas were in the cast but hey its a Miyazaki movie i said, and as i expected he did it again a really good movie sure its not Spirited away or Princess Mononoke but it was really good.. hey what i was trying to say is that i was expecting good things out of the frog and not from the cast of Ponyo, but i was proven wrong thank god.. MIYAZAKI FOR LIFE!!!"
1,not what i expected,"What on earth was Disney thinking? Why the heck would they put voodoo in a children's movie, specially an animated one. I couldn't believe it, I was very disappointed. I was very excited to see the movie b/c of the previews, which showed no voodoo. It seems like Dreamworks is started to be a better animation for kids and families. Lately some Disney movies have been going downhill. It's just not what it used to be."
1,patronizing stuff,What a waste of money. Disney had to come up with a story to keep our separatists happy. My girl wanted to watch it but it's going in the trash before Disney can brainwash her.
1,Bad very bad,"The movie invokes voodoo, demons etc. If you care about what your children see I would not recommend this movie at all. We threw away the movie into the trash."
4,Nice movie,"Good movie, very cheap fast shipping.My kid love it. I'll recommend this movie to everybody. It's funny.The only part I don't like is the mean guy :P"
3,"Movie cute, but DVD was scratched in one of the scenes","The movie is adorable but our DVD has a scratch in one of the scenes. That was the only disappointment. I give the movie itself 5 stars, and the dvd issue took to points away."
3,Princess and the Frog,"I haven't watched this movie yet, but my 3 year-old daughter has. She has yet to make it through the entire movie. I've asked her if she wants to finish it, and she doesn't want to. Maybe she's still too young to understand the movie; perhaps in a few more months. She loves the movie ""Cars"" and ""Finding Nemo"" and has sat through both of those, so I'm not sure if it's the story or lack of action in the movie that has her bored. I'll try showing it to her again in a few months."
5,The Messiah Plays Brahms,"Kissin has done it again, surprising his listeners in the most unusual places (I'm thinking of the tender passages of the Paganini Variations and the funeral march of the Chopin Sonata on earlier recordings). I, too, expected to be wowed by the Sonata on this disc, and then to enjoy the Hungarian Dances as pleasant little additions. Think again, folks. The sonata is, of course, brilliant and wonderful and more interesting than I've heard it from anyone else, but in the passion and sheer MUSIC that he finds in those old over-worked Hungarian dances, he truly brings the dead back to life. Listen to this while you're alone, because if you can recognize and respond to great piano playing, you will be jumping up and down and howling and weeping with joy."
4,resource book on kitchen designs,"I first saw an earlier version at the libary and got this because I thought it would have more up to date ideas. However, it did not. If you are looking for a good resource book that explains the basics of kitchen design this book is for you! If you need detailed information on the latest kitchen storage or trends like raised dishwashers it only skims the surface. I liked this book enough I would have everyone building or remodling a kitchen read it. It help you really think about the needs you might have for a kitchen. It might not however, give several ideas on how to solve those needs."
3,One awesome track,"I'm not fond of his singing, and most of the other tracks on this album are just OK, but the included recording of ""Nobody Else"" is the most gorgeous song VG ever recorded, IMO, and may be worth the price of the album to some. He did an earlier recording of the tune with just the trio, which makes for an interesting comparison, but this one with a studio orchestra is a must-have. Kudos to whoever did the arrangement."
3,Average,"Discusses price retracements, extensions and projections based on fib number ratios. By using this, one can look for confluence of levels based on each of the 3 tools above as potential areas to trade in. Nothing remarkable and it's 6 pages, so don't expect much."
3,Shatner is Painting the Scenery,"Call it William Shatner's ""lost"" Star Trek script that is located in a very unique setting; the Federation, Borg and Klingons battle for control of the universe in a paintball war.Shatner leads the Federation in the wild fun that keeps the story line moving throughout. With typical Shatner verve, a game becomes a fun way for James T. Kirk to lead the forces of good...one more time."
2,Disappointed,This item is REALLY SMALL! I ordered it because it is described as large and the previous review stated it was HUGE. The 3 that I received were only about 4 inches across the bottom. Not at all appropriate for my three older children.
4,Fun toy...but too big,"I bought this toy for my daughter who was in need of a variety of sand toys and, when it arrived we were happy, I was just surprised as to how big it was. I was thinking a little toys for pouring sand onto, but no it is huge!!!"
3,Not for the caual Star Wars fan,"The best part about this game is getting to watch all the video clips and remembering fondly watching the films in the theaters. I bought this game for my 9 and 11 year olds. Unfortunately, most of the questions are too difficult for them ( or me, for that matter). Unless you named your kids after some obscure alien who got almost no screen time in any of the six films, I doubt this game will become one of your favorites."
1,Just a little miffed,"When I ordered this item the description said it was unabridged. After it arrived the CD case had a more in depth description. It turns out to be unabridged and edited. How can you get an unabridged reading of an edited reading? Plus the CD case further describes On Christian Doctrine to be of great assitance to the Reformation. Saint Augustine's writings are being twisted, contorted, and parceled out if that is the summation. I would have appreciated these revelations to have been in the descrition provided by Amazon so as to not have wasted my postage having to return the item.I gave the item one star simply because it was required for posting the review."
3,Good - if you like Augustine,"I found this book to be a bit dated. It has some helpful advice, but it's been said much better and more understandably in other books. Much of it is a guide on how to read the Bible. However, I have many of Augustine's writings (and this is no exception) to be too metaphoircal and cryptic. That style is ok for some things, but it's no good for explaining something as practical as how to read the Bible. Also, it was (understandably) rather dry. For a better book on the same subject, I would suggest Fee & Stuart's ""How to Read the Bible for All It's Worth."""
5,Exactly what I needed!,After an entire week of trying to find the replacement carafe locally (thinking it would be quicker to get coffee brewing again.) I should have ordered from Amazon on Day 1. Carafe came quickly and I am back in business!
2,"Cuisinart Replacement Coffee Carafe, Not In Like New Condition",Found this to be in not the like new condition that was stated. My old one broke and I was quite disappointed when I opened the box.
1,Inferior quality glass,"I have owned the Cuisinart Automatic Grind and Brew coffee maker for four years, and for the most part have been pleased with its operation. However, in that period of time, I have had to replace the carafe three times due to the inferior quality of the glass and its tendency to break easily. After reading user reviews, I have discovered that this problem is being experienced by others as well, so be forewarned. I contacted Cuisinart Customer Service, but their only response to my complaint was that the unit is out of warranty and that there was nothing they could do to assist me."
5,item is as advertiesd,It's a coffee pot just like the one in the amazon add. It arrived in a timely fashion and works as advertised.
1,six weeks and still waiting,"we have been waiting six weeks and still have not recieved shipment from this vendor. If you want coffee soon because your carafe broke, try someone else!"
2,Buy stainless steel,I broke my original one. Then I broke this one after a while. I should have bought the stainless steel one to begin with.
1,coffee carafe,It was the wrong size and I never found the right size. I have never been able to find the correct size. Therefore I didn't like it.
2,I'm just not a policy wonk,"I'm torn about giving this book 2 stars. It's obviously well-researched by someone who's spent a lot of time thinking about the subject but it's not the story of Dictator Trujillo or the Dominican Republic or even a story at all -- there is no narrative. It's a book about policy written for policy wonks. It is not a coherent history, but rather an extensive thesis on how the different perceived goals of the military and state department interwoven with the personal biases of individuals create policy, using the Dominican Republic as a case study. It questions the perceived wisdom that propping up dictators and strong men in non-democratic nations at least create a framework of stability that benefits a country, if not the individuals within a country.Recommended as a sleep aid because it's the driest thing I've read in a year."
3,"Thrilling views on a crucial issue, but poorly substantiated","This book approaches a topic which deserves serious attention by scholars of international relations - much more than is happening. It approaches this topic from an interesting and rather revisionist point of view, offering the author's views and some interpretations. Yet, the study is not so subjective, and not at all substantiated by facts. All in all interesting reading, new views to talk and argue about, but nothing really new or inspiring."
4,Not Bad a'Tall,"Some may find Maier a little long-winded with his accurate and detailed descriptions of how archeology works and how archaeological findings are tested for authenticity. Still others may find the love story almost unbelievable (not quite!). However, by the time you reach the end of the book you will have read a great, thought-provoking mystery that stretches you both intellectually and at least a little spiritually. I'd recommend it to anyone!"
4,Refreshing,"For a historian at heart and soon (in historical time that is) to be professor of history, this was a refreshing book. I dont get to read much fiction and was given this book by my friend. I must say it was an interesting angle on a issue that is very intriguing. If you enjoy books but need a bit more to tickle your mind and if you are intersted in our relationship to religion you should get this book. I liked the way it was written. It was perhps not the most poetically written book but it was straight forward and keeps you thinking about what will come next during the day as you wait to get home to read it. Really get it. It wont hurt and you will want to read more of him."
2,"Nothing like ""Pilate""","I read ""Pilate"" and couldn't wait to read more of Dr. Maier's writings. Following ""Pilate,"" this book was a real disappointment. It had a fascinating plot, but the characters were completely unbelievable. He tried to put a romance in the story-line that just came across as ridiculous. I find it hard to believe that ""Pilate"" and this book were written by the same person."
4,Wow. What a book,"As a Christian, I read this book and found it very challenging in a good way. Not only is it a interesting, entertaining, and plausible story, but I found myself having to remind myself that it was only a fictional book. It was hard to put down, and hard to forget. The only thing I didn't like was the love story--why force a romance into an otherwise superb book? It just seemed somewhat trite. This is definitely worth reading. It was an entertaining, thought provoking, and faith strengthening experience for me."
2,Author's Fantacy,I read about half of this book before giving up. The author is an intellectual who has pulled off some great novels. This one seemed more like a personal fantasy world for Maier. That in itself wouldn't be too bad if the author's fantasies were something I cared about.
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree so much with G Man. The plot was great, but the character development was poor. The romance was totally unbelievable. I also didn't care too much for the author's theology, but find it quite understandable. The LCMS is the bastion of dead orthodoxy. Quite typical that the fictional hero hadn't prayed in years, was disdainful of other persuasions of Christianity, and showed marked antipathy towards Orthodox Jews. Very, very disappointing indeed."
