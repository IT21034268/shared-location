4,A BIT MUCH,I'll say that this is not for the faint at heart. But for those that love the roman period shows YOU WILL LOVE THIS!!!
4,I AM SPARTACUS,"Loved the series. This set is AWESOME, watched all 13 episodes in 3 days! 1st disk is filled with lots of previews for Starz series otherwise I would have rated it 5"
2,"Mildly Interesting, But Really...","I was interested in this series because I love history and thought that this would be an accurate representation of the rebellion led by Spartacus and how the rebellion came to be, though I admit I know next to nothing about it other than what I saw in the 1960 epic Spartacus. The first minute really said it all: coarse language. I personally have no problem with profanity (I use it almost any chance i get), but I don't think that kind of vocabulary was used in Ancient Rome. The sex I had no problem with either. The scenes with Spartacus and his wife had beautiful music and were well-filmed. I like how Spartacus really cared about her and said that throughout. My other problem with this episode was also with the obvious CGI backgrounds and CGI blood, which looked like something out of the erroneous and pseudo-""Historical drama"" 300. Skip this."
2,"Just Like Gladiator, 300, & Rome...NOT","If you enjoy gritty, graphic movies such as Gladiator and 300, and quality historical-based TV shows such as Rome, then you'll absolutely hate Spartacus: Blood and Sand. This show is nothing but cheap-looking special effects, soap opera-style acting, and tons of slow-motion blood and sex which looks so fake that it's hilarious (even the naked women look fake, like they're made of plastic). Unlike shows such as Rome and movies such as Lord of the Rings, the budget computer-generated special effects in Spartacus make it look like the actors are running around in a cartoon fantasy world. The writing is poor, the acting is laughable, and the endless slo-mo scenes of decapitation and/or intercourse will have smart viewers scratching their heads and wondering how this show managed to stay on the air. Spartacus: Blood and Sand is more like an R-rated cartoon than a gritty, realistic, adult-oriented action show."
2,Did teenagers write the dialog?,"While I admit the show is fairly entertaining, the dialog is so horrible I couldn't continue to watch this show. It's like their lines were written by teenagers just learning to cuss...really who writes dialog like this?? Too bad I was really wanting to watch this..."
2,Juvenile entertainment,I received the series as a gift. I could not watch more than the first episode. The blood and gore were just too much for me. The gratuitous soft porn scenes I felt were unnecessary and the script and story line are fit for teenage fiction. I will have to re-gift the set to someone who maybe able to appreciate it.
2,Esperaba algo mejor,"Voy a redactar mis impresiones de forma concisa...1. Demasiado sexo gratuito e irrelevante para la historia.2. Actuaciones debiles. Solamente Xena salva la debacle.3. Efectos especiales no me terminaron de convencer, la sangre se ve poco real.4. Historicamente, no tiene muchos aciertos y se desvia de la historia original.5. El paquete esta bien presentado.6. El guion lo pudo haber redactado mi hija de 5 anos. No hay sorpresas."
4,Beware the Bluray box cover!!,"I almost sent it back!! In fact, I set up a replacement and then had to call them and stop the new shipment. The box cover for the bluray does not look like the picture! There is no blue box on the top. Instead, there is a gold bar, like the non-bluray box cover, except this one litely has a bluray logo on it (also, not in blue!)."
1,Spartacus Seaon 1,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD SET OR THE SEASON 2 SET. Obviously produced in some back alley production shop. Three different sets received from Amazon. All three sets had play issues as follows; Discs will not load. Individual episodes on loadable discs won't play, skip, video but no audio, audio but no video. Also purchased Season 2 discs that are experiencing the same issues. Am attempting replacement/refund with Amazon now. Avoid these low quality poorly produced discs at all costs. They will only disappoint you. This was disturbing since the Spartacus series is awesome. However my attempt at obtaining a complete collection has been made impossible due to the poor production quality. I just hope I can find discs that were produced by a reputable firm even if more expensive. These discs were obviously thrifted in order of offer them at a low cost. In this case low cost equals low quality."
5,Awesome series!!!!,"I ordered Spartacus series one for my husband after seeing the first episode. It was shipped right away and my husband was very happy when he received it, it was a surprise.I have always been happy buying from Amazon, they have great prices and we always get our order right away!"
4,Good Series,"The first 2 or 3 episodes are kind of cheesy, and resemble a soap opera... but it pick-ups after that.The photography takes a while to get used to (it looks kind of fake, and not like 300); BUT, as with the plot, it improves after a few episodes."
5,everyone gets screwed,"Nobody ends up in a good place the end of the season. Somewhere on disc two you will realize just how devious and manipulative everyone is. A bit too much dudity but the fight coreograohy just keeps getting better throughout the season. I really liked the series and if you enjoyed 300 and Gladiator, then you might too."
5,Very Satisfied,"Very happy with service received when product was delivered faulty,and had to be replaced.Rapid responce to problem, and was kept informed of progress.Well Done."
5,TV-MA,"Big fan of Spartacus. All three seasons. The story is very appealing to men and women. No go for kids under 18. Violent, Gore, Nudity yet very cool.Story telling is realistic (sorry Rambo, your fake lol).What is nice about this show is how it's produced to display slavery, hardship, the true life of a gladiator. Yes its violent, but as gladiator games existed at that time this show shows where gladiator came from, how they turned into a gladiator and their purpose.I would recommend starting from the very beginning and finish all three seasons. Can't wait for season 4!"
5,Spatacus: Blood and Sand - Season 1,"I think the series was excellent... well produced, great story, even better plots and sub-plots, and lots of intrigue. If you view it you will see it ishistorically accurate with great cinematography , sound and costumes. It shows very clearly that humans have not changed one bit in over 2000 years.Not for the squeamish , has lots of sexual content, bloody violence, and XXX language. You must understand though , that this was Rome, the period in timeand that life had very little meaning . You had a problem you needed to resolve? Violence. You wished to pacify the masses ? Violence. You had a politicalagenda to promote....promote it through violence. An excellent portrayal of the early human condition."
5,Great!,"Great special effects. A little violent, but what can you expect from a gladiator series? Also, not for the young, as there is a lot of sex, but the end is excellent! I can't wait for the next season to come out."
3,Disappointing,"It is fairly good, thus I gave it 3 stars. the graphics are excellent and the actors keep you on edge. The story line wasn't the best to me. The plot needs more development. There is a lot of female nudity--especially full frontal nudity. But if you are at all interested in male frontal nudity, it will be shot from afar on rare occasions, if at all. You will barely see it."
1,MAGNIFICENT FAILURE!,"This is one of the most awful films I ever watched. The film is devoid of any artistic offerings and any ideas at all. ALL those who like to see blood all the time, most disgusting killings and butchering of people and from times to times scenes of sex, can waste money on this.There is neither history here, nor arts. The pity is that the producers disregarded all those viewers who would like to see a new interpretation of the legendary hero Spartacus. But in additon to disregard towards history, one can easily feel a contemptuous attitude towards the viewers' taste.This is definitely the worst film on an ancient theme I can ever imagine (I am not saying an classical film, as that would be an insult to the latter phrase).Please preserve your nerves and avoid this film."
1,Truly awful,"Gratuitous cartoony execution. This show is all about really bad CGI, gratuitous sex, and painfully boring slow-motion fights with buckets of blood. The special effects detract from an otherwise listless story."
5,Highly Entertaining!!,"Male nudity, violence, sex, and language. The series is about a Roman gladiator named Spartacus who is captured and becomes a slave in a gladiator school headed by Batiatus in Capua. Building interest and depth in the plot you automatically become fully vested in the characters without even realizing it. The story is wonderful without becoming predictable. This is a must see series very Historically written and really makes you wonder how things really were back then."
4,Not bad,"It had a Slow beginning, lots of sex, blood and Violence but eventual Climax at end of Season 1. Overall, it was ok."
4,spartacus,I bought this for my son for Christmas. It was priced right. Took just a few days to get to my home.
3,Its okay,The series is interesting i think the zero season (actual 2nd season) is the best but I would say this isnt a tv series i going to watch again. Characters are well thought out but the loss of the original star and replacement on the 2nd season (3rd season of the series) pretty much ends it for me.
5,Spartacus: Blood and Sand,"The classic tale of Spartacus that will draw you in, spin you around and take you on a wonderful adventure that you do not want to end. Initially the blood splattered on your screen and the slight gaming like sequences might put you off but hang in there it only gets better. If you enjoy a real epic journey, filled with love, lust, hatred, treachery and sex, this one is for you. The sex is basic, graphic and well within the historical timeline. Get it, watch it and enjoy - I await season 2 with anticipation - so order 1 and 2 at the same time - you will not want to wait!!!!!"
5,Must see for mature audiences,"This is a must see for mature audiences. The graphics are far better that 300 and what a plot to evolve!! I love old kingdom era and the one to one fighting, blood and gore. This was superb in sound, make-up, direction of fight senerios. I'm sorry it's over and I hope they make many more seasons."
5,Gripping and Romantic,"It was wonderful to see Jalal in a story of his own and find out why he'd behaved that way in the previous books. I love the way Alexandra Sellers writes such strong female characters and Clio lives up to her past achievements. This book is so romantic and is filled with such palpable sexual tension, that I could hardly put it down. It kept me up late for several nights running. Wonderful."
5,Didn't want it to end,I don't think anyone can write sexual tension like this author. I had to close the book and put it down for a few minutes sometimes. I didn't want Jalal the bandit's story to end!
5,Highly recommended !,"I buy more cookbooks than I ought to, and, while I cook a great deal, somehow never seem to give my new purchases a thorough workout - but this cookbook is the exception. I use it very frequently, and love it. The recipes actually are very fast, but it's the interesting and delicious flavours that impress me, in combination with the speed of preparation. Havn't found a problem recipe. (My husband likes to cook from this book, too.)"
4,Very cute but not worth the money,This is very cute and my daughter loved it. But it really was not worth the $17.00 I paid including shipping. But hey if she likes it I guess it's worth anything.
1,Interesting ideas but thats all,"I expected a better how-to type of book. He has some interesting ideas, but the book, rather than leading you through a project just points you in the right direction. Not really for the novice, and the more experienced wouldn't find it very useful"
3,"Robots, Androids and Animatrons, Second Edition : 12 Incredible Projects You Can Build","This book has some basic, but in my opinion, mostly intermediate to expert level information in robot building. I feel they should have included more step by step walk-through guidelines. Yes, to a certain degree it takes away the mystery, but in this day in age, people are looking for a more direct approach to gain experience. If this is you then keep searching for another more concise Robot Building manual. I will be.By the way, does anyone have a recommendation for a Robot building guide that is more of a step by step guide. I dont mean basic kits either, more like...something with complexity."
3,Did Not Realize the difficulty level was so high,"I expected a book that I could actually use with the training I have had. I've been a computer science major for two years, and took one class on DC circuits. But this book was way beyond my level! I wish the seller had made the difficulty of the experiments clearer."
2,Missleading title,"The title says robots you can build, yeah this is true if you are an engineer. The projects are not cheap either, almost all require a basic board, which is about $150 . It does give you a list of the parts and there price, but it doesn't say where to buy them from. All it lists is the name and the address of a company, that I think the author must work for. It is good in that it has an interesting few chapters on AI, robots now and in the future, which are very intriguing. I can only recommend this book to those that have deep pockets and know how to read schematics. If you don't have either, then I suggest you wait for the programable leggo robots to come out this Christmas."
1,...,"This isn't a ""hands-on"" projects book as the title would suggest. Poorly written. Useless. I could summarize each chapter as such: ""Ok, go buy a RC car, buy some components, attach the components to the car... and you're done. You have a robot! Isn't that cool?"" Sheesh. What a waste of paper. I just bought Robot Builder's Bonanza. I've heard good things about that book - so I'll give that a try now. It certainly can't be any worse than John Iovine's book. Buyer beware on ""Robots, Androids, and Animatrons""."
2,worship jams 2,We were not expecting it to be mostly christian rap so we were disappointed.It may have read on it of this fact but I assumed it would be the same type of music as worship jams # 1 .
1,NOTHING NEW,"A friend informed me of this book, but I was very disappointed. It was the same old info that I have previously read in other health books."
4,DAWN WIND BOOK,The book was used but condition was excellent except it was a Library discard with the usual Library notes and stickers as expected.
3,Only one flaw,"These pedals are very cool looking and comfortable. They are nice and wide. The only problem with these is that the rubber wears down very quickly. It is the fatal flaw for such a nice pedal. I've had them for a about a month now and it looks like I've had them for a year.(I bike an average of 20-30 miles per week) It is a shame because I really do like them, they are excellent in every other way except for that fact. I would only recommend these to only those who do little biking."
4,Fashions of the 60s,"I purchased this book while designing costumes for The Odd Couple by Neil Simon. It came in handy for identifying appropriate hairstyles, hemlines and tie widths. In any case the Sears catalogue is always an invaluable reference for the costumer of any decade!"
2,Deceiving,"I was very disappointed. Although fashions are fun to look at, it would have been great to see the pictures in color. The clothing colors in the '60s were so vibrant -- seems pointless to print this book in black and white. Very disappointing when I opened it up to see only the front and back covers in color. Should have read all the reviews."
2,Black & white photos - no color!,"Biggest problem is that while the photos are gorgeous, none are in color -- Only color pix are the inside covers!!! No wonder the book is so low-priced - the only reason I'm not returning it. I would not have bought this book if I had known photos were b&w."
5,High Quality Kit,"I've been working on guns for years and I'm not sure how I lived without this screwdriver kit so long. A very high quality kit. I had been struggling with removing a difficult screw from an antique rifle receiver and was worried about marring the finish. This kit made short work of the screw, with not a mark on the finish. It's nice to have the right tool for the job!"
1,great if your 5 years old,ok i own just about every flight sim out there and thought i would take a chance. the box looked impressive. but this came should be called card board aces . the graphics come across like early 1970s . it looks like you are flying if you can call it that crayon drawing. this is the worst attempt of a flight sim in the year 2006 i have ever seen . blazing angels got a lot of bad press. but the graphics are a 1000 times better then this flying cardboard drawing. with these new games you need at least a dell dimension 3000 and a new ati radeon card. but dont waste your money. sure the box looks great but its like buying a porsche with a moped engine. trust me go with il 2 or il 2 ace expansion pack it does not dissapoint
1,"Horrible, Just Horrible","I paid $10 for it and it's not worth a penny. Poor graphics, poor controls, poor everything. Flight simulation is horrible. If a plane really had that bad a turning radius, it would take 10 miles to turn 180 degrees.Reminds me of the original sub simulator game that I played on my original PC junior 20 years ago. This game is not much beyond that one."
4,Jimmie Dale+Mudhoney=whoo-hoo!,"Jimmie Dale Gilmore and Mudhoney sond great together. Who'da thunk it? Their version of Townes Van Zandt's ""Buckskin Stallion Blues"" is worth getting this disk, I often play it twice in a row. And I liked Mudhoney's ""Tonight I'm Gonna Go Downtown"" as much as Jimmie's; his version of Mudhoney's ""Blinding Sun"" is great, too. A great disk to play while driving."
4,Especially for Jimmie Dale Gilmore fans,I especially enjoyed Jimmie Dale Gilmore's interpretations of Mudhoney songs. Mudhoney did a fine job in their version of Jimmie Dale's song-but his version is still the best.
5,Excellent and Informative,This book is one of the most important books written in recent history. Immigration and population growth will cause great harms to this country if left unchecked. Mr. Beck leaves the reader with powerful arguments for reducing the current levels of immigration to more traditional levels.
3,"Good book, with some flaws","I found this book to be a solid read, and I support rolling back immigration to about a 1/2 or a 1/3rd.However, Beck doesn't mention the flip side of a rollback. He talks of the harm that newcomers cause to environment, but ignores the economic benefits of immigration. Furthermore, I find something distasteful in blaming, not the suburbanite who drives a SUV, but the immigrant who takes a bus, for environmental problems.His analysis of the high tech arena is particularly weak. Just about every observer (other than Matloff) agrees that the high tech arena has been helped a lot by immigrants, including the several companies that were co-founded by immigrants: Sun, Borland, Intel, Yahoo. Last year, an immigrant professor here in Princeton got a Nobel prize, and immigrants account for 1/3rd of all Nobel prizes. Surely, the number of great discoveries made by immigrants compensates in some way for the environmental problems that may be caused by others ?"
4,Straaaaaange,"This is a stone in the church of music. You discover the marvellous voice of the great Shawn Smith and you can immagine what will arrive later.... Satchel, Brad, and more. Buy it and continue the discover of my favourite voice."
4,very good,Everything was disclosed to me that I needed to know to purchase the product as a used item and I was satisfied when I received it.
4,Better than alternative!,"Reading several books on Mesopotamia, I like this one the best! IT is useful for a class but also engaging and interesting. Now, I might not choose this as a pleasure read, but worth the work for the learning."
3,Not as described,"Note that picture for this item is wrong, therefore you get different product. I specifically needed the one that's on the picture which is ""photo safe"", however I got ""for paper only"". If you don't have specific needs, this glue is a way to go."
3,"When they say SHEER, they mean it!","Nothing against the seller, transaction was perfect. Product is nice and long, correctly sized, but tissue paper thin. I'm sure I will not be able to wear this to work without sometthing over it. Too thin for my liking."
3,It's okay says it.,"It was quickly delivered. It works, but sometimes it is easier to just punch out the pills with my fingers. One at a time still takes a long time.."
5,Mozart Variity,"This is an excellent CD. So much fine music and is so many genres. Concertos, symphonies, chamber music, arias and more. It's well done and there are contributions from several well known Mozartians. Highly recommended."
4,Great source of Omega's,"I would say that this supplement is arguably the best source for Omega Fatty Acids out there. That being said, it's fairly pricey to use as a daily supplement. Also, the taste and texture of it is pretty horrid as far as supplements go. I would try and down it with some sugary apple juice, but the oily nature of the oil caused it to separate and not mix at all. It also caused me to reminisce on my 3rd grade science class where we learned about density of liquids. This recollection in and of itself makes me want to buy the product less because anything that reminds me of my 3rd grade teacher (who was keen on pointing out my shortcoming) should be avoided at all costs.So overall if you have the money to spend, a strong stomach, and most importantly, no suppressed memories, then this supplement may be perfect for you!"
4,HFS EFA,"Great Product!I wrote a review for the liquid version of this, which I find to be much better in quality and you get more bang for your buck. This product is still fantastic and you can really feel the effects... if you're one to have a vitamin regiment, and might forget to take a liquid supplement, this is your alternative."
2,Short Forever-----Took me FOREVER to finish!,"I am a normal lover of the Stone Barrington books. However, this installment of the series was not an enjoyable read for me. I didn't like the book being in England. I'm not into reading foreign books. I didn't like the character match ups especially Stone with Monica - then Sarah - then Arrington. I think it made him look to much like a man ""harlot"". I didn't really like the plot of the book (yes I understood it, just didn't like it). Thought some of the things going on were too far-fetched. I like to try to imagine the scenery and what's going in the book in my mind, but couldn't do that with this book. I still love Stone and Dino and will give this series another try. Hopefully the next attempt will be better!"
3,SEEMED KIND OF LONG TO ME,"THE SHORT FOREVER is a neatly written, but sometimes slowpaced Stone Barrington entry by prolific writer Stuart Woods. Barrington is a good hero, but seems to have female problems all the time, this time featuring not two, but three love interests, one of whom might possibly be a killer. Woods' complex plot is engaging, but there are many distractions, including too many dinners and descriptions of how to get somewhere. Why do so many writers want to tell us they know their locales by giving us insufferably unnecessary travelogues? Ah well, at any rate, by the time the novel reaches its rather unspectacular climax, we feel there's room for more of these characters in future Barrington books. Average read from an average writer."
2,A so-so read,"While I normally enjoy Woods' novels, I found this tobe a bit lackluster. As Stone Barrington ages, so does the plot. I must have skipped the one sentence in the book that explained what government secret was being sought. I didn't feel the tension and excitement that should accompany an authorof Woods' caliber. Also, Stone Barrington's wandering eye forwomen is getting tedious. Sorry, Stuart. This just didn'tmake my day."
2,"Trite ,Trite","I passed comment on Blood Orchid a few weeks ago. The same applies to Short Forever. Thin plot corny dialogue, boring. Bye Bye Stuart"
4,Okay...but not the best!,"I gave ""The Short Forever"" 4 stars only because I love the Stone Barrington character a lot. Woods has always done a great job of developing Stone and growing him from novel to novel. What I didn't like about the novel was Stone's love interest just because she seemed a little bit boring and not the typical woman that he goes for. However, since this was a Barrington novel I had to give it a chance. The plot was great and some shocking things did occur, and the book was fast paced. Some of the sex scenes are very imaginative and actually funny too (as seems to be the way with Woods). All in all, I recommend this book, but also try out ""Swimming to Catalina."""
2,"Yuck, what a waste of time","Woods spends 200 pages building suspense and actually kept my interest setting up a bizarre mystery filled with shady characters and descriptions of London lifted straight out of Rick Steves. The payoff, however, simply never comes. Characters come and go with no consequence, and the whole convoluted plot is resolved in a couple of sentences in the last chapter. There are more good guesses on Stone's part about people's character, motivation, and action plans than is believable, and the bevy of hot women hot on his trail gets a bit silly after a while. What a stinker!"
2,what a waste of potential,"Sadly, this is my first Stone Barrington novel, and if this is any indication, it would probably be my last (likely not, as other novels in the series have been much more favorably reviewed). It's a relatively quick read, but a read that just seems like wish-fulfillment: Stone somehow knows a LOT about London, is able to find his way easily, and every time he turns around there's someone he was looking for and has now just accidentally stumbled across. Isn't London bigger than that? For some reason, women throw themselves at Stone, and only in the last eighth of the novel does anything like a plot resolve itself. However, the ending is a big ""so what:?"" with no ramifications for Stone other than more fantasy fulfillment (women, riches, adventure -- the usual James Bond-like trio). I was hoping for a more character-driven, intelligent book; I was disappointed with this entry in the series."
3,Barrington comes through again.,"Typical Stuart Woods . . . a good fast read with plenty of action but nothing menorable. 3.5 stars. Never the less, I'll still buy Stuart Woods' books from Amazon."
3,Harry Bosch is Better,"I have read all the Stone Barrington books in order and enjoyed the first few. But now Stone is too suave and his ex-girlfriends keep turning up in places that are not believable. He is so wonderful he took away the girlfriend of the most famous movie star in Hollywood, and now she can't leave him alone. Their problems are getting old. Stone ends up meeting the most beautiful women as soon as he lands somewhere and ends up in bed with them within twenty-four hours. After a while this gets tedious. I don't know that I'll be reading any more about Stone. Harry Bosch, by Michael Connelly, is a much more believable character and more likable. He doesn't have sex everyday with beautiful women who follow him around. His cases are more interesting and believable, too."
2,Stone Barrington needs a long vacation or a new job.,Stuart Woods seems to have taken the same road as Patricia Cornwell and other noted contemporary authors. Find a character and stay with it until it begins to smell. There is nothing new or fresh in this work. If I wanted to read amorous fiction I could pick up a tabloid press copy or a bodice ripper at the supermarket.
2,Much Ado about Nothing,"This isn't a mystery novel. That is the first thing one should understand if one chooses to read this book. It would barely qualify as a procedural in my opinion. The problems are many. First, the main character isn't described at all untill 3/4 of the way into the book and then the only feature I was able to discover is that he has blond hair. Second, the main guy runs around a lot and has a lot of apparently great meals but that is all. He solves nothing, it is all solved for him. The only ""murder"" is solved in a way that would be kind of like playing a guessing game and at the end someone saying ""oh it was number 13."" without you even trying to guess. Needless to say, I was terribly dissapointed."
4,STONE BARRINGTON ** BOOK EIGHT,"Stuart Woods gives us book number eight in the Stone Barrington series. This one is one good mystery set in London. Of course we get great food, interesting high class personalities and of course, Dino and even Arrington makes a cameo. Barrington is hired to go to London and bring back the clients niece...but is anyone who the seem? HIGHLY RECOMMEND the series and it must be read in order."
3,So-So,"Not nearly as bad as the last few books in the series, but this series is really starting to fall flat.Stone gets involved in situations unlike most mere mortals -- all his cases involve rich people, fast living and the jet-set, which makes it really hard to relate. Women fall at his feet. Police and government agencies willingly give him confidential information and let him involve himself in their cases -- usually because there's a female in charge who can't resist his charms.Mr. Woods' arrogance once again shines through when the book is over, where he talks about not having to edit and telling people not to write to him to tell him of his errors. Perhaps he should take his ego down a peg and worry about getting this series back on track."
1,English?,"I'm sorry, but I have something against any book which is written in 6th-grade English and is full of typos. Especially if it is a cheap edition and cost over $16.Perhaps English is not ""Tamara's"" native tongue, in which case she should have gotten a proof-reader to help her. Here is an example of the ""very peculiar English"" in this book (page 48): ""Letting go of compulsive behavior means both from a behavioral perspective we set goals and work on eating habits, for instance."" Go figure...."
3,too narrow a format for so much info.,"The earlier edition had more head room so to speak.,larger dimensions.Easier to read. print is too small. They may have added more iems in this ediion, but they also excised or shorted many of the articles. A slightly larger version is called for--This edition is all a bit too stubby."
4,A great little encyclopedia,"I do a great many crossword puzzles and this is a great reference. Also,I read many historical books mostly on the Civil War and this is a greatreference as to the events and players in that war"
4,great space saver,This is a great space saver of having an encyclopedia in one paperback. Brief entries instead of a multivolume.
5,quality weather vane,Bought this as a gift for my in-laws who love golden retrievers. They have always had at least 2 in their house. They absolutely loved this. It went perfect on their new storage building. The quality on this is also very nice. I was very pleased with this gift.
2,problems,"I bought this bugaboo for my newborn son because it is versatile and solid. After mounting it, I inflated the back tires with the pump provided (not an easy task, because the pump is really small): twenty minutes later, one of the tires EXPLODED. I found out that it is not an uncommon problem. I sent an email to their customer service and they did not reply in the next 24 hours. I called and a customer service representative naturally gifted with bad manners told me that they will send a replacement for the exploded tire. Delivery time: 7 business days, which basically means two weeks between the explosion and my possibility to use the stroller. Way too long for a new baby!"
3,"good, but not the best","Before to get pregnant, I already have choose the stroller for my future baby. Even thought it was really price, but it's ok when you think that it is the best. It was ok, my baby it is 4 months old, until I lend to my girlfriend daughter which is 19 months, she was huge for the stroller. Off course I got desperate!!!!! I used for 1 month since I bought at end of December and does not worth at all.Off course nobody wants to take back, the store or the company ( even I barely used), so what to do?Sell where everybody buys every thing.Before to buy, please make a test with a older baby, because I'll say that my I'll be using just for 2 years and not 3 -4 years which I was expecting."
3,CANNOT register star and NO RESPONSE from customer service!,I paid almost $10 for this frog (and twice as much for the dragon) and we cannot register a star. Apparently shiningstars.com has had an issue with this and they aren't fixing it. I emailed them TWICE and they will not respond. Thanks for disappointing my child!
4,Nice Idea - Nice Quality,"I think the idea behind ""NAMING A STAR"" is a very interesting concept to gift recipients. Contrary to some of the other ""Shining Stars"" animals in which I was disappointed in the actual product quality, the FROG seems to be well-constructed."
3,It's ok..,I guess I bought it because of the novelty of the star registry...Which is a great idea! I love that! However the plush toy is not that great quality it looks much better in the pic. But it's not that bad although I'm sure Russ could of made them better. But for the price I guess you can't ask for much. Overall ok.
3,Standard Text,"I found Standing Room only was useful as the recommended text for the Arts Management Post Graduate at UTS Sydney. It would be great for a new edition to be published that includes more recent marketing examples and methods, like e- business and contemporary arts organisations as it is really dated."
4,The perfec book for marketing the arts,Is a very complete book. All theater workers and person of the marketing of performing arts must have it. I like it
4,"Ohh, Brother, Brother, what have you done?","Pete Dexter's latest novel immediatly strikes the reader as being a mystery, a whodunit, a question to be answered. Yet these questions disappear throughout the text to make room for a male only family and their slow spinning downfall. Set-off by way of the Newspaper business The Paperboy delivers the reader through the swamp lands of Florida to a land akin to that of Conrad's Heart of Darkness. Yet the darkest place of all, somehow, is the space a story takes between three men who are bound together by family love and possibly an understandable self-destructive mechanism"
3,Disappointed,"I'm slogging through this book and finding it heavy going. There are too many conflicting points of view, too many unreliable witnesses. This is imitation Erskine Caldwell at its worst (does anybody even remember ""Tobacco Road""?) I've been a journalist and I've worked for the Miami (Herald) and this book says nothing to me that's true about journalism."
2,slow moving,The story is quite boring and unfolds itself rather slowly. Don't read this book if you are the impatient kind of person. Don't expect action or gore in this book.
1,No thanks,"So boring, finished it just to hear the end. The end was boring. Do not read this book it is a waste of time, I will not even be watching the movie."
1,Don't waste your money,Terrible book. This was a complete waste of time and money.Not interesting at all.Can't believe I fell for the reviews.
3,The Paperboy book doesn't deliver,The movie MUST be better than the book. I can think of many books that would have been my choice for a film over this one: Gone Girl being one.I chose The Paperboy because it had been made into a movie. I thought that meant it had something going for it. I was wrong.Picturing the characters as those cast for the film version helped me read the book to the end (and it did improve toward the end). I would say there are better books out there so don't waste your time on the book: see the movie.
3,The Paperboy,A great read from start to finish. Recommend for those sick of romance and mystery novels.
2,Tell me again what this book was about please...,"I must say that the synopsis of this book was a bit misleading. I was expecting to read about some newspaper reporters investigating the murder of a backwater - town sheriff who was killed by a local swamp redneck. The story started out this way and it was really good. Kind of a cross between ""Deliverance"" and ""Midnight In the Garden of Good and Evil."" About half way through it turned into a story about the reporters themselves. I was not pleased. However the writing was excellent."
5,One of the best living writers,"Dexter sentences are so sharp and clean he cuts right to the essence of each character and situation. So many people talk about tight pros and crisp writing that it's a cliche, but this is the real thing. His material is violent and masculine but I think with his talent he could write about nearly anything and make it interesting. The Paper Boy shows us how hard it is to get to the truth about anything. This is a novel that will outlast Dexter himself. Highly recomended along with Paris Trout and Brotherly Love. I wish Dexter would write another novel, and I bet his next one is about Hollwood. The corruption and BS out there ought to be good grist for his mill. HB"
4,Brothers,"Just finished reading the novel and some of the reviews. I borrowed this book and may end up buying my own copy. Enough said.I would reread it mainly to concentrate on the similarities between Jack and Ward. When Jack feels that swimming has completely taken over his life to the extent that he can hardly tell night from day, he drains the pool and his life assumes a whole new focus, albeit only because he is kicked out of college. Ward, on the other hand, becomes so enmeshed in his story that his obsession takes over and ultimately claims his life.An interesting pair."
5,Great story!!,"The story was great. I rated it ""I love it"" because I loved reading this book. The book was much easier to read."
1,Save your money & buy another book from Amazon.com instead.,"I read ""The Paperboy"" for a book discussion group I belong to. Everyone basically agreed that this was an awful story, as the characterization was flat, and the story dragged. The ending, which should have been the most important part of the story,was rushed. The only thing good about the book was the artwork on the cover."
3,"325 miles over narrow, mostly shoulderless, two-lane roads","""All that winter and spring I drove the north route for the Tribune, traveling 325 miles over the narrow, mostly shoulderless, two-lane roads of northern Moat County.""NO. Not in 8 hours, not in 10 hours.Any writer can make a mistake, but editors are supposed to catch and fix mistakes."
3,the paperboy--not dexter's best,"pete dexter is one of my favorite writers. i did not like deadwood, but i have liked all of the other books of his i've read.this would be my second to last favorite though. it was okay. i mean, it was well written, but the story was about one thing, and then it was about another. things were all tied together by the investigation at the core of the story, but the themes (or take-away points) started out as one thing and then changed to be about something else. i wasn't sure what i was supposed to take away from it.also, the story was set in the 60s. but, i wouldn't have known that if it weren't mentioned on page 1. it did not FEEL set in the 60s. it could have been set today. i guess maybe that was the point? the timelessness of the story? that it could just as easily happen today (which, of course, it could have)?it was a well-written book, but i don't think it was dexter's best story or storytelling."
4,A very good read,"I enjoyed this book a lot, and so did most of my Mass Communications students (it was assigned reading). I had intended to show the recent film, too, but felt it was inappropriate for any educational setting. Adults can choose to watch whatever they want, but I try to maintain some standards of decorum, even in a college classroom. The film also has several MAJOR changes from the book, and not for the better. I told my students it was worth the $1.20 rental at (a DVD kiosk), but not by much."
5,"Grickle Grass, Grickle Grass....","I watched this video for the first time when I was about 10. I know I wasn't the target audience for the movie, but I loved it! For one thing, all the songs and rhymes are really catchy, and the acting is great. On a deeper level though, it is really a haunting story, especially when you have to watch all the animals leaving because they were forced out of their home. Read the book, then be sure to watch the movie!"
5,Wore it out now have to buy a new one!,My 3 year old and 20 month old love this movie and I love the message it sends. It is the video I play when I need to get supper made. My kids sit quietly and watch the wonderful animation and listen/sing/dance to the catchy songs. It is an important environmental message the video sends that I hope every child can grow up with and learn from.
2,Weber Cast Iron Griddle,The product was not the right size for my grill so it has to lay on top of the regular grate. Other than that it worked well for cooking.
3,"9"" Boots",It's a bit smaller than I would have liked but my granddaughter liked it so that is all that matters.
3,Good medium sized kid toy,"I was pleased with the size, bigger than a beanie baby but a good price. My daughter likes it but I did cut off the window hanger, didn't remember it saying that was part of it. All in all if your kid likes boots they will enjoy it"
5,Cuddly,"Our Dora took Boots with her to Trick or Treat. She says ""Boots is cuddly"". I am glad we found him for our 3 year old as she enjoys taking him to play as well."
4,Great toy...a little smaller than expected!,"I bought Boots for my niece, and I am sure she is going to love it. But I was expecting it to be larger than it is. I know it says it's 9""; the picture just made me think it was going to be larger."
2,Not worth the price,I ordered this product instead of the Ty version of Boots because I wanted something larger than a Beenie Baby. The Gund version is only slightly larger and it really isn't the quality that you would expect from Gund. It should be priced much lower to make the purchase worth it.
5,We just love Boots,"Boots is Dora's sidekick so I just had to get this for my grandaughter as well. Boots is just as cute as it can be. My grandaughter has almost everything ""Dora"". Thank you for making it so easy to buy hard to find items."
2,.,"I was very disappointed with this item. It was very small, I have purchased other stuffed animals that were bigger and better quality."
2,cheaply made,"This item wasnt nearly the quality I had expected. It was the type of toy you would expect to win out of a toy grab machine , not worth more that a couple bucks."
1,Not the quality I expect from Gund,I didn't care for the materials this was made of. I have come to expect better quality from a Gund product.
5,BOOTS!!,Boots is my daughters favorite! It is a great stuffed animal and she just loves carrying him around. Love it!
5,Boots,"Well made, soft & squishey for the little ones to hold & hug. Washed up nicely. Baby girl takes it with her everywhere she goes"
4,Boots is so cute!,My daughter is in love with Dora and Boots. No way could I get away with not getting her a boots doll! His face is quite large but he's cute. She loves him so much.
1,Mad!,"I bought this toy for my 2 year olds birthday. It is horrible quality! It looks like something you would win at a carnival. After my daughter played with it for 2 hours the tail ripped and the fingers are coming unstitched. She absolutely loves it because it is Boots, but i'm afraid it will not last long and I will have a heartbroken daughter. For the big price tag I expected far more. I do not recommend this product to anyone!!! It is a huge rip off!!!"
2,NO BANG FOR YOUR BUCK,"I would not recommend this toy above $7. The toy appears poorly stitched and slapped together. The product description did not mention the suction cup attached to the head of the doll. Age range on toy reads, ""...NOT FOR CHILDREN UNDER 3 YEARS""."
4,Boots,"Gave it to my goddaughter, 4,and she like it. It was shipped fast and the price is OK. No problems here."
4,Just what I was looking for,This item was just what I was looking for. My 2 year old daughter loves Boots. She thinks its his show and not Dora's. I didn't want anything too fancy or too big. Great Buy!!!
1,Don't Watch This Movie,"I watched this entire movie waiting for it to get better. Much as I love Nick Stahl's acting, even he could not save this film. I threw it in the trash (where it belongs) because I knew I would never watch it again. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen (that honor belongs to, ""Indecent Proposal"") but it may be the second."
2,No wonder I have not heard of it,"I picked this up in the DVD store and it had a few labels on the front saying ""official selection from such and such film festival"". I read the back and it said it was a new take on the Charles Dickens classic Oliver Twist. Well, let me tell you that Dickens himself would be totally offended by this rubbish.Basically the film focuses on a bunch of young gay hustlers who don't know where their lives are heading. One is hooked on herion, while the new recruit just needs someone to love him. The film moves too slowly for its own good, and at the end of the film I cared very little for any of the characters.This film is one of those annoying films that tries to be so much more than what it is. There are better films out there that tackle these sorts of issues."
3,More Hopper than Dickens,"Think very slow (lento), extremely downbeat, and one of the longest 90-minute movies you'll ever see. Stahl and the others are marvellous, but it's a high hurdle to try to transpose the under-your-nails grime of Victorian East End Dickens to present-day Toronto. It just looks Hopperesque. Unrelenting despair and not a glimmer of humor. The actors do a great job, but the script just doesn't cut it. Extract from it what you can, but this will not be a pleasant experience."
3,I like movies like this...,"I like movies that put a new spin on classic tales, but this one was just okay. Good performances but it lacked a spark. If you are into indie, explicity gay-themed movies, check out NEVERLAND (the gay-themed Peter Pan, NOT the Johnny Depp movie!) or watch FREEWAY (Reese at her trashy best). These movies really do something interesting with the source material - in fact NEVERLAND stays closest to the original while still managing to be completely unique - and the cast is gorgeous."
3,"Gritty, gut-wrenching, and flat.","This film has wonderful, colorful actors, it's well-made, well pieced-together, and it's generally very professional.Unfortunately, it's more a snapshot of life (and not an attractive life) than a story. The film left me a little flat and unsettled, and I guess that's an indication of the film's power, which is considerable, but a bit wasted with a story that goes, like it's characters, literally nowhere.I wanted to see the characters develop, but they are arrested at their current status, and all we are given in terms of a resulution, is a final burst of hatred and self-destruction.Worth seeing, but not the best."
2,Mediocre games,"The three reasons I purchased this is for Mahjong, Hearts and Solitaire. Haven't tried everything else, so they may be O.K. Mahjong is O.K. - not the best I've seen, but reasonable. Hearts and Solitaire and not amuch fun, since the computer does most of the work for you. It automatically moves your cards into place, without input from you at times. While these moves may be obvious, I do not care for the lack of input myself, having it take over for me. I've used much more interesting and fun programs, and would not purchase this one again."
2,ok games,The games are ok. But sometimes difficult to play or understand the rules. WHen have nothing else to play they will do. I was disappointed in the creativity of the games.
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!!,"Keep looking, there has to be something better out there for MAC. Instead of the multiple games (640), that I read about in one place and 225 in another, the game I got only has 19. The ones I have played so far have the computer show you what moves are available instead of letting you figure it out for yourself. I haven't found a way to turn the hints off. On the games that I don't know how to play there is no help screen that gives you directions."
4,card game,"I bought it for the canasta card game, which I ened up not liking. The rules were different from the way I have ever played. I do like several of the solitare and Mahjong games. My husband likes to play Crazy 8's."
4,Interesting book,"Bought this book as a Father's Day gift for a WWII veteran who was stationed in Brisbane, Australia during the war. The book appears to be well written and contains many historic photos."
5,Hilarious - Must Read,I have read all three of Ruper Morgan's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them. I would highly recommend this book to John Stewart fans - they would appreciate the warped perception of how things really work with regard to the office of the president and all that entails. For a full description of this book I would suggest a visit to the British Amazon website amazon.co.uk - then come back here and buy the book! You won't regret it.
3,A Beginners Guide to Dance and the Body,"Rachel Vigier's Gestures of Genius begins as a description of Rachel's personal discoveries of her own body through dance and then veers in to more historical accounts of other women's journeys.Personally, I feel that if you have not studied dance and the body previously, then you may find this book useful. But, in my case, I have done a little research on this topic and found the points that she made could have been more in depth.Rachel makes a few good discoveries, but she could have gone farther."
1,"Racist, well refuted rubbish","Patricia Crone's ""scholarship"" is widely refuted by scholars of Middle Eastern studies today. It is certainly no great work of history as the prior reviewer suggests. Rather she is a racist with a clear orietnalist agenda."
4,Negro League Baseball,Facinating insight into this era of Baseball . The marvellous photographs effectively communicate many aspects of the time . Accompanying essay very informative and has wet my appetite to learn more about the history of the Negro League.
1,Never received product :(,"I never received this product from the vendor! I wasn't sure what to do in that case, since I've never had that problem with Amazon. Not sure if I will try to order a replacement or not."
4,We love it!,"My wife and I like to open a few stubbies of beer and settle back to watch/listen to Willie and Kris and the cast having a lot of fun. Unfortunately we have to hire it, and always have our eyes open for a copy. The script, music, acting appeals to us. Definitely one our our favourite films."
4,fun movie - great soundtrack,"I enjoyed the movie a lot, but I enjoyed the soundtrack even more. Songwriter, Under the Gun, etc... now I just need to find a CD copy of the soundtrack (or maybe a DVD copy of the movie?)."
5,Greatness!,"If you love Willie and Kris this is the flick for you, just good old fashoined rowdy fun. Fix yourself a drink and enjoy the show. It makes me smile everytime. Nothing earth shattering here, just a good way to spend a few hours enjoying some escapist entertaiment. Willie and Kris are national tresures and the great performance of Rip Torn can not be underrated. Hell fix yourself 2 maybe three drinks and be prepared to laugh your ass off. If you don't enjoy this flick your fun meter is broken !"
3,For Serious Fans Only,"If you aren't a die-hard Willie and/or Kris fan, I'd let this one slide. It's a lousy movie only partly saved by some gems on the soundtrack. I had it on VHS back in the day and let it go in a yard sale only to be pulled back in. There's one of us born every minute!"
1,songwriter,didnt get to watch it came broken and was unable to watch.very unhappy with my purchase and i really want this movie
5,Sunny Circles design has a removable cover.,"This is a great pillow. Nice and stuffy, fits tightly around the waist (I'm on the small side though). I see that most negative reviews are because you can't remove the cover. This seems to be the case with the ""dots"" designs, not sure about the ""stars"". I've ordered ""sunny circles"" and the cover is removable/washable. Good luck to you and your baby!"
2,Why can't you wash this??,"The pillow provides decent support for the baby while feeding, but only allows for spot cleaning. And let's face it. Spilled milk and spit up need to be thoroughly washed from the material. I am going to have to buy a washable cover. Might as well have bought a slightly more expensive pillow."
4,Good Pillow,Great pillow. My baby loves this pillow but the only issue we have with it you cannot remove the cover to wash it.
2,Bad quality,"Good idea but Bad quality....Plus the secure band cannot really hold the baby well. There is no replaceable pillow cover, so cleaning will be an issue too.Not recommended!"
1,Leachco Cuddle-U - Nursing Pillow And More - Pink Pin Dot,"Imaging yourself laying on the harsh stitches of the ""pillow"".I have to put some soft blanket inside U shaped pillow to preventour newborn from hurting her back.Learned from my mistake, will never buy this kind again"
2,Would rather have the original boppy,"I registered for this because I liked the way it had a belt that would hold the baby in while sitting and I figured I could use it for nursing as well. However, the pillow is much bigger than a boppy and I could never get it in a comfortable position for us - would have worked great if my boobs were at my shoulders since that's where my daughter would end up when I put her on this thing! Also she never liked to sit in it at all...lasted about five minutes and she would start to fuss. Stick with the original boppy."
2,"A boppy is just as good, but without the hassle.","Personally, I have a boppy and a cuddle-u, and I prefer the boppy. The boppy is not only fluffier, but has a removable cover. (I know that they now make reusable covers for the cuddle-u, but my boppy came with the cover.)But the BIGGEST reason that I prefer the boppy is the very reason I bought the cuddle-u: that incredibly obnoxious ""strap"" that holds the baby in.As it turns out, not only did I not use the strap, but I ended up in a constant battle with the thing. Every time I would grab it for a middle of the night feeding, the strap would end up out and spread across my bed, and I'd have to roll it back up and stick it back in the pocket. (Where it would stay until the next feeding, at which point it would escape again.)Needless to say, the strap lost the battle at about 2 months, when I cut it off with a pair of scissors after a particularly difficult night.It may be cheaper than the boppy, but I'd spend the extra money to avoid the extra fabric."
4,Great product wish cover was washable,"This is a great pillow. I actually received it as a gift from a friend that had a newborn that wouldn't sleep lying down and slept in hers all the time until she was 3 months old. It ended up being used in the same way at our house over the first 2 weeks, the belt keeps baby from slipping down. I also use it for nursing while sitting on the couch. My husband uses it when he gives our son a bottle. And like pretty much everyone else, I wish there were some sort of washable cover for this, my son is a bit of a drooler when he nurses and while I've gotten used to throwing a burp cloth over everything, it would be more convenient to have the cover on all the time and wash as needed. FYI I know this is also available at a lower price from another MAJOR discount retailer."
3,It's Okay,"I purchased this nursing pillow, because of the reviews I had read. I number of people said that they had purchased the Boppy for their first child, but then bought the Leachco Cuddle-U for the next baby and liked it so much better. I am a plus size gal (size 16). The pillow doesn't fit around my waist. My primary purpose for the pillow was for nursing. I use the pillow sideways, so half is behind my back and half is in front of me. It gives me something to rest my elbow on while nursing, but that's about it. I don't think the seatbelt is necessary. You can just lay your baby on the pillow. I will use the pillow to help support my baby as she learns to sit, but right now she is 2 months old. My husband uses the pillow under his arm, when he holds the baby and she is sleeping. He doesn't put it around his waist, but tucks it under his arm. I say use a regular pillow folded in half to support your arm while nursing and save yourself the money."
5,Love this pillow!,"This pillow is great! We use it every day. It's a versatile pillow...can be used for tummy time and it aids if you are nursing, but mainly we use it as a seat/back rest. My daughter is 3 months old and we just strap her in and she can sit upright. It allows us to interact with her without having to hold her 24/7 and gives your arms a break! My daughter takes naps on it all the time and I don't have to worry that she might fall out of it because the velcro straps keep her very snug and secure. This pillow has been a godsend for the times that my daughter isn't interested in her toys and doesn't want to be held, but still wants attention and to be near us."
2,Boppy is better,"I tried to use it for nursing but the pillow is so soft, I was better off using a pillow from my bed. The ""buckle"" part has velco and it would always get stuck on blankets and other things, it was pretty annoying when my little one would fall asleep and I would have to move the pillow and put her to bed.I haven't used my breast friend but I hear that is great and this time I have two boppys because it was convient to have one upstairs and one downstairs. I wouldnt recommend this one, i ended up throwing it away because it was very irritating."
1,No removable cover!,I am returning this product because this version does not come with a removable color. Other versions do and cost the same.
3,On the fence.,"I like how good the pillow feels-it's not too soft, gives good support for mom to seat on after delivery and to nurse, an infant for belly time and for toddler as a pillow to lay down on the ground. But I don't undertand why there's no removable cover? Certainly it is washable but than it doesn't look the same anymore and you have to wait instead of just changing the cover."
1,Blue stars cover does NOT come off,"I've been using this to nurse but I hate the fact the cover does not come off so you can't throw it in the wash if milk gets on it. My son recently had a dirty (poop) diaper leak (not a big leak, like a drop or two), and I don't feel like I can spot clean it well enough to ever put my son on it again. I don't use it to set him in like the picture shows because he has a gym, swing, and bouncer for times I need to put him down. I have used it for tummy time to help his neck muscles. He's 7 weeks old. I wish it was at least water resistant since there is no cover to remove."
4,Infant Support Seat,This reminds me of the pregnancy pillow I used to sleep on -- same kind of feel and support. I bought it for my 5 week old baby who likes to be held a lot. She doesn't quite fit the harness but this does surround her very well and looks like she's being cuddled. It could be a 5-star product if only the cover was removeable -- already had a few spit ups but at least they wipe away pretty clean. I was hoping I could use this for my fussy baby to sleep in but the pillow comes w/a warning tag that states specifically to NOT let a baby sleep in this...***update***I have been using this for tummy time since my baby was 3 months old. She is now 6.5 months and still loves to watch the world while propped up on this pillow. The u-shape helps keep her up comfortably and holds her in if she tries to roll over.
4,Pillow was great.,We don't use it for breastfeeding which was what we initially bought it for. But my one-month old daughter loves to sit comforably in it either on the floor or in her crib. it works wonders with her. I'm very satisfied.
1,Floppy Mess,"This pillow is not firm enough. It bends down in the center causing my daughter to sync in the middle and her neck is bent. I have to stuff another pillow under the center to make it keep her body straight. I dont use the strap which makes it frustrating when the darned thing falls out everytime I grab the pillow to nurse. Then I have to roll it up and put it back. There needs to be someway to keep in there when not in use. It does not stay close to my body, most likely due to the floppyness of the pillow, I have to constantly readjust and pull it closer to me to maintain a proper latch. I would not ever recommend this to anyone I care about."
5,LIked it,I liked this pillow it was exactly as pictured and stated. So soft! I would recommend this to my friends.
3,She loves it but its already ripping at 2 weeks,So it is a great design and she loves laying in it. We use it everyday for feeding or just putting her in it to hang out. The seam is opening up at only two weeks of use. No! I don't have time to fix this myself.
4,Great,"Still not using it but looks great.if u have big b.., don't use it for breastfeeding. I think it's made for women who have small boobs."
5,Lifesaver!,My 2 month old lovessss this item! He loves being held and this gives him the same sensation. He also loves it in his pack and play for naps. It is better than swaddling and much better than a Boppy!I use this item throughout the day...I will surely buy again for my next baby!
1,not good,"the fabric off tha cover its so thin,in the first wash the product made so ugly because the cover and the pillow comes together,you cant wash separatly."
1,Don't Buy from this seller,"After waiting forever for my nursing pillow to arrive, I received what was supposed to be a NEW pillow that was most certainly used. It had stains and was not the sage pin dot but some blue stars, which is not what I ordered. When I contacted the seller for a refund he out right refused and I haven't heard from him since. Be warned don't buy from this seller."
4,Le' Cuddler Infant Support Pillow,"I haven't used this product, but I added it to my registry! It looks very nice and is a good idea. I like the front strap. I havn't seen this type of pillow before! :)"
2,Oops.,"These came in separate packaging from the rest of my order, I spent about three times as much as I would have buying them from a store.Average quality.This was my mistake, but seriously, buyer beware."
2,Solar Cooking for Vegans,"In searching for books on solar cooking, I am interested in recipes for omnivores. I have never purchased tofu or textured protein, and never will. I was very disappointed with this book; Ms. Kofalk stated that even though she isn't a vegan vegetarian herself, she wrote a vegan cookbook so as to not offend. Funny thing is, I am rather offended. This cookbook is of no use to me.Also, I can't help but feel that Ms. Kofalk is perpetuating an image that only left-leaning, naturalist vegan vegetarians will be interested in solar cooking. It seems that in this age of diminishing resources, more and more meat-eaters will be interested in harnessing the sun's power, too."
2,Disappointed,"I wish the Amazon description had stated this was a vegan cookbook, I have found a few things I may cook but not worth the price."
3,Wasn't Happy at Page 22 - It's a Vegan Cookbook,I was happily reading away - the book seemed great and then I hit page 22 - all vegetarian recipes - in fact completely vegan.... which I am most emphatically NOT. Wish the author or the publishers highlighted the fact that this is a non-meat eaters cookbook. I'm disappointed.
2,Not high on the Rand recommendation list,"Some of this book is simply embarassing. What most sticks out in my mind is her marginalia in Mises's _Human Action_. She had the penchant of constantly misunderstanding what Mises said; I think it revealed a lot in terms of Rand's ineptness as a philosopher. Objective interpretation of other texts is hardly her strong point. It also really doesn't do much as a book in another sense: we get primarily a bunch of short quotes taken out of context, so the marginalia are only marginally <g> useful."
5,Delightful glimpse of an active mind in action,"It is almost as if you are sitting right next to Ayn Rand as she critically read and evaluated. You can watch her home in on the essentials -- and often the essential nonsense -- in some important and influential books. The best part is that you can have this intimate, private view of such a great mind for the small price of this book."
1,Rand never looked worse,"I agree with other ""negative"" reviewers who regard this work as embarrassing. This book ends up making Rand look very bad indeed. In note after note, she seems determined to misunderstand, distort, even re-write what she is reading. If I were the executors of Rand's estate, I would have burned these notes. To publish them to the world is practically scandalous."
5,Happening party mix!,"""Is Everybody Happy Now?"" is an understatement for this classic mix of upbeat tunes with a great sound. Create your own happening party mix. . .throw on this CD and ""shuffle"" with everything from The Talking Heads to Fats Waller, Village People to Cole Porter, for music that will keep the party, everybody, happy now!Lewis' other signature tunes, ""When My Baby Smiles at Me"" and ""Dip Your Brush in Sunshine"" are included, as are ""appearances by"" top stars of the era from Benny Goodman to the fabulous Fats Waller singing ""I'm Crazy Bout My Baby.""Highly recommended for all music lovers with an ear for the finest in grand old entertainers."
5,Great Toy,"wonderful toy. Unfortunately, my son thinks the rock is a ball. So, he picks up wooden train rails instead. the figure is durable and can easily fit in the other Little People toys (e.g. school bus)."
3,Bulldozer,My son is not interested in Little People but this is a nice addition to the set if your child likes them.
5,Nice to see the words that led to the film.,I teach the film in screenwriting classes so it's good to show the words that led to the images. Probably wouldn't be that good of a read if you were approaching it as pleasure reading.
5,Beautiful ornament,This is the second baby's first Christmas ornament I have purchased from this company and I am imprssed once again. The detail is beautiful and the quality is exceptional. There is even a space on the back where I'm going to have my baby's name engraved.
3,The Mystery of a Butcher's Shop,"I always enjoy Glady Mitchell for light reading detective stories. Her detective, Mrs Bradley, is a hoot although we could do without the cackles, leers, snorts and other witch-like descriptions of her conversations. A bit too descriptive and off-putting. Plots are logical and make an enjoyable, uncomplicated read."
4,Amazing color,I love the color a lot but it's easier to fade away compared to purple haze and other kind of purple color.
4,great but messy,"I love Manic Panic and have used it numerous times, but this particular kind seemed messier than usual. The color is amazing though and totally worth the mess."
4,I agree w/Raye,"If you use the two quart, then don't try to put two quarts into it; the point is, be sensitive to the volume limitations. This pan will last you 'til the second coming, but so will CIA, and All Clad. I would invite Viking & All Clad to be more competitive pricewise.If you can afford it, buying something that will last is a good thing. Both Viking, CIA, & All Clad (in the kitchen; I can't speak for manufacturing ungreenness) were ""green"" before it got popular. tlc"
1,Total waste of money,"This video is so completely devoid of information and/or instruction, that not only did I want my twenty bucks back, but I wanted the half-hour of my life back that I took to watch it. No joke. Take ONE surf lesson anywhere, and you will get 50x more out of it. I'm sure there are other, better video choices out there as well. This one is really lousy."
1,don't waste your money,"hi, im a surfer beginner, i've been for almost a year and i thought this DVD was going to be good,cuz i've heard of andy irons ans stuff, but i found out it was so poor and lame, please don't throw away your money, it shows a couple of useful tips, but about the most important part (standing up) there is this kid i don't know who he is on the explaination instead of been Andy Irons Himself, that was kind of dissapointing ... no big deal this Dvd i think i'll stack it on someplace where it will get dusted ...."
1,A wasted opportunity,"Having surfed a couple of times before and not being the absolute natural I was sure I was destined to be, I purchased Andy Iron's DVD. The Chapters profess to cover everything the begineer needs to know, from buying a board to standing, turning and safety. Unfortunately the advice given in the DVD is simple to the point of being patronizing. Iron's advice on equipment involves him going into a surf shop, picking up a board before exclaiming something along the lines of 'this one will do', quickly followed by the narrator pointing out that some of the equipment they're showing you is sponsored by Andy. Iron's coupe de grace is reserved for his explanation of how to stand up on the board, which equates to 'hold the rails, push up and stand up'. If it's that easy andy, why do I need to buy your DVD?"
1,Less the Best,"This product is not very informative, poorly produced, and the tiny bit of information given can be found on youtube or other websites. Very disappointed!"
1,Awful,"This DVD is a joke. If you want good content, not here. If you want good production values, not here. On the other hand, if you want to see Andy Irons stare into the camera for 30 minutes while wearing a hat that shills his own surf company, this is pretty good. What a waste of space. He says like three things the whole DVD, and otherwise, it's like he's auditioning to play the role of ""Surfer"" in some 80s movie. Irons has some sort of sidekick in the movie that does most of the talking (and offers the only real instruction), who is equal parts informative and annoying. I kindof felt sorry for him as it was clear the producers (or Irons) made him do all kinds of lame stuff to try to add some comedy to the DVD. Fail."
5,Wonderful book for anyone that loves animals and plants!,"As a holistic veterinarian, and also as a friend of the illlustrator of this wonderful book, as well as being honored to have the special cat on the cover as one of my favorite clients, I was very lucky to receive a copy of this book in the mail. I have to recommend this book because of its amazing content and unique insights. When I received my copy a few weeks ago, I sat down and read it cover to cover and was charmed by the stories and also inspired about how this could help with healing both animals and people, as well as plants. I have recommended it to my clients as I feel it is something that will help bring people and animals to a closer understanding of one another and of the spiritual bond between them, that I see every day in the course of my work."
5,A beautiful and profound book,The grace that comes through these pages is just amazing. This is truly one of my all time favorite books. I love the personal story viewpoint and the fullness of life the stories convey. This is a book I have bought for and shared with so many others because it brings such warmth and wisdom into one's life. Magically divine!
3,Good bio but other sources needed,"I found this an interesting bio of the great Chuck Berry, but it is overly focused on the trials rather than the tribulations. Page after page of court testimony made this book less enlightning on Chuck's complete life & times and more on his run ins with the laws of the times. These are legitimate items for a bio but more on his music and its inspirations and influences would have rounded out the book more. Important reading for a Chuck fan but left me with the need to read more to get the full picture."
5,Great tool,This is so handy for the Weber grill. I had to have one so I didn't have to find a place to put the lid all of the time.
4,A heavy-weight with adjustable hooks.,"It seems to work fine except the lid does not sit at a right angle to the grill as shown in the picture. Quite honestly, the large (not small) hook on the inner side of the grill top is quite sufficient for hanging the top from the handle. However, if you are going to cook with the top on, then I'm not certain the handle would withstand the heat from the hook. In such a case, the 'Slide-Aside' would be very useful."
5,Great product!!,"I like to browse the Weber product line on Amazon to find that extra little something for my ""I don't need anything for my birthday"" husband. When I saw the Weber Slide-Aside, I knew it was something he would really use, and like!! And does he ever!He uses his grill almost every evening in the summer, and said he cannot imagine how he did without it before. It is such a simple and efficient product...no tools necessary to install...just slide it on the side of the grill and start cooking. No more heat rings on the wood deck, accidental arm burns from the hot domed lid...just slide the dome over into the Slide-Aside. I highly recommend this product!"
3,Make's your grill leak air,"There is a real problem with all these items that hang off your webber grill - they cause it to leak air! The main advantage of a Weber grill is the fact you can put the lid on after you are done cooking which snuffs the fire so you save all your charcoal for the next time.These hanging items keep the lid up just enough to keep the fire burning. Result? All you charcoal keeps right on burning so next time you cook, you are greeted by just ashes."
5,Awesome grill accessory,It keeps the lid off the ground when I'm checking on the food. You don't have to handle the lid too much to slide it into place. Easy and useful!
5,Love it,This does what it says it will do. Didn't interfere with the lid at all. Now I have a place to put the lid besides the ground.
3,Does what it's intended,"This works slightly easier than the built in lid hook, but for me, I would put the money into a charcol starter chimney instead."
5,Necessity,This is a necessity. No more bending down to find the tiny hook on the underside of the lid...this makes the process about 100% more efficient.
4,It's like having an extra hand...,Since I cannot have a gas grill and love to BBQ I got this. I have a small terrace and no place to put the lid while cooking...this makes it so easy! Its like having an extra hand because it frees your up!
4,Not perfect but pretty good.,This is a more elegant and efficient solution than the hook on the inside of the lid. However it's still not perfect. The vent on the lid can get caught on the holder and the holder itself can fall off. But currently this is the best solution for storing your lid while cooking.
4,Not a bad accessory,"I think the name is slighty miss-leading. Definetly a put aside vs slide aside. However it is a handy accessory, much easier to use than the hook on the inside of the lid. It also doubles as a wind block when lighting in windy conditions.After reading the reviews I was some what concerned about buying this product. Once I used it, I knew it was not being returned. Definelty not a necessity but very handy to have. I am now the proud and happy owner of the Weber Slide Aside."
5,Very useful,"The slide aside is very useful. We were always dropping our Weber lid on the patio or trying to juggle it while dealing with the food. We have been BBQing for years and years and not only is the Weber Kettle the best BBQ grill we have ever used, this item makes it even better!"
3,Grill,"I really don't use this a lot. When I do, it works fine for me. I'm single and usually its just me so its the right size. Its just when I'm not a planner when it comes to meals; when I'm ready to eat, I want to eat. I love the taste of charcoal grilled foods but for the convenience and speed, I think a gas grill would have been a better option for me."
4,Works better than expected,The tab that held the lid to the tub of of my Silver series Weber had mysteriously vanished some time ago and I was laying (or dropping) the dome on the ground whenever I took it off. This does a better job.I was worried the tabs would interfere with the dome's flush fit to the kettle but it did not. Very clever design.I dropped one star because this seemed out of the price range for a simple bent metal device.
4,To understand nutrition + processed/packaged food stuff,"A must read for understanding processed food and packaged food in the supermarkets besides nutrition. Though written in 70's, the book is still relevant for the day. Highly motivating towards switching to healthy & wholesome food habits. Has a ""Layman's Question & Answer"" approach to the subject, yet covers the subject in depth, with clarity and humour - making the book easy to read and benefit from it."
4,Needs an update regards fats,"Book is good but needs a serious update regards ""fats and oils"". Check out the following titles. ""Nourishing Traditions""by Sally Fallon, and ""The Coconut Oil Miracle"" by Bruce Fife, and ""Know Your Fats"" by Mary G. Enig.Have found so much misinformation by ""experts"" with conflicting data, that I just had to ferret out what is 'true or false"". The listed books did that. Talker"
4,"Good riffs, but the overhyped hooks get stale","Good band, good songs, really good guitar work. The only downfall is the songs all have such big hooks...that it actually lessens the impact...like the old saying too much of a good thing. A must own, I just hope the guys varry things up a bit, or do a live CD to showcase all the talent without the production gloss....do yourselves a favor and check out Skinlab's new live CD to see what I mean....ton of variety and probably the heaviest thing you have ever heard....with no 'gloss'"
4,Great Hardcore,"This album is great. I was kind of hesitant to purchase any of this bands albums but boy am I glad I did. The songs are brutal but have nice clean breakdowns as well. The best song and most brutal song in this album by far is Weak Willed. Excellent vocals. In this song Phil delivers great death metal growls. The lyrics on this album are pretty good. The drumming is superb as well as the guitars. If you are a fan of KsE you will probably like this album. If you don't want such a catchy album you might want to try their last one ""The Darkened Heart""."
5,Amazing!,"I listened to this cd for about a month straight after I got it and never got tired of it! I've owned it over a year now and still love listening to it. If you're a fan of screaming metal that also has some good singing in it like Killswitch Engage or Bullet For My Valentine, than you will probably love this album! Buy it!"
5,YES!,"Finally, another metal album worth the money spent to purchase it.Metal hit a dry spell for a really long time with mainstream pop-metal bands that nearly sank the genre back into the dark ages.""The Fall of Ideals"" starts off with a bang and keep going throughout.From headcrushing double-bass lines, to wild guitars, to melodic vocals (mixed with snarling ones too)... this album delivers a true experience.Metal and Non-Metal fans alike can enjoy this album for years to come. Put this in your CD player, hit shuffle, and repeat. You could be satisfied for hours!"
2,Comformity Metal,What a great band but the singing hooks are so boring. Don't get me wrong I love singing and screaming together but why be so predicable. This is another attempt to be Killswitch. Let KSG be KSG!!!!!!!!!! The Weak Willed is the best song for me because the clean singing came out of nowhere. That's what's up. Rest of the album is just KSG with a different singer. Great musicians but (follow the leader/cliche) driven.
2,Buy Skinlab,"Check out Skinlab folks.......everything else is trying to merge the Machinehead/Skinlab bay area sound with pretty vocals...it's just too predictable. For a sonic lesson wait and buy the new Skinlab live CD, SkinnedAlive.....4/29"
2,why do so many people like this??,"I dont know what to say about this band. I know that they're becoming pretty big but i cannot figure out why. This cd is the same cookiecutter over produced sh** that is ruining the repuatation of a great genre of music. Between the repetitive song style, the girly vocals and a lack of originality, this cd isn't even worth the time it takes to listen to it, unless you want to hear the same lame unoriginal song 11 times. I guess if you like cheesy a** copycat metalcore then its a good buy. If you dont feel like wasting your money look elsewhere. From A Second Story Window's Delenda or Nights Like These' The Faithless (I know i know victory sucks but oh well) are a good place to start if your looking to buy some cds. Oh im not 13 either im just sick of signing in."
4,Refreshing stuff for this old-school metaler,"This is great stuff! I haven't bought any 'new' music in so long, it was great to know that the children of all my old faves (Sabbath, Maiden, Metallica, etc)have been putting out some real quality tunes for today's new 'heavy' generation.The songs on this are fierce, but melodic-- the riffing is tight, and the verses are brutal. The production is absolutely stellar. (I wonder if they can pull that off live.)I'm sure you young thrashers out there already know how great these guys are, but I'll definitely say this was a welcome surprise knowing that the heavy era didn't end when my favorite metal dinosaurs started putting out all that tired old garbage. Great CD!!!"
5,Best Album to Date,"This album is definitly ATR's best album to date. If you get this album, listen to it from begining to end, its just simply amazing. This is my favorite album of 2006. Metal isent dead nor will it ever cease to get better and better. This album beats lamb of gods new album, shadows fall new album easy."
5,Correction,"Ok, I love this album, and I've already written a few extensive reviews for this so I'm not gonna do that here. I'm here to correct some people. The new drummer IS NOT A GIRL, it is Shannon Lucas, a man. The new bassist however, IS A GIRL, Jeanne Sagan. Don't try to correct me, watch the video for This Calling, and I saw them live. So, bullet-point Drummer = Guy, Bassist = girl. And this album = unbelievably amazing."
1,Originality? HA! Creativity? *Chuckle*,"Get over yourselves kids, there is nothing good about this band. The simple Slipknot-esque chugga chugga riffs, the lame Killswitch Engage/Hatebreed tough guy 'Tude-filled vocals, and lets not forget the aWeSomE BrOOtaL JumP-Da-*uCK-Up breakdowns!!!!!!1111!Seriously, its bands like these that give metal a bad name. Invest into something more worthwhile, like say Strapping Young Lads ""The New Black""."
4,WARNING: excessive use of double bass.,"While I can appreciate a band wanting to show off their new drummer who can actually play the double bass, it can be a bit much at times, especially in ""This Calling"" where the whole chorus is pretty much just double bass. It can actually be hard to hear the guitar in some spots of the album due to the double bass. But other than that, I really enjoy this album, Phil Labonte has a great scream/ growl, and a very good singing voice, and the guitars are exceptional!"
5,Beau Chansons De Noel,A very pleasing voice with classical and traditional Christmas music.I studied French in high school and college. But over the years had lost much of my French due to lack of use. I wanted to regain the knowledge that I thought was lost. I got out an old cassette I bought 22 years ago of another French singer and found that it brought back much of my French. I wanted a Christmas CD in French that would help me regain my French. I bought this one. It is wonderful. The music and voice of Jack Lantier is very soothing and pleasing and great to listen to after a hectic day during the Christmas rush to remind us of the true meaning of Christmas in any language.
5,Excellent French Christmas CD,"I am very pleased with my purchase of Chansons de Noel by Jack Lantier. He has a wonderful voice and he does a great job with one of my all time favorites Christmas Songs, ""Il est ne le divin enfant"".I highly recommend this CD!"
3,Applied Data Communications book review,"This book is a required text for a master's class I am taking. The content is very good and germane to the subject of data communications, but is well dated. Both the book and the associated case studies refer to the technology of the early 2000s. While the basics of technology remain the same, the content should be updated given the price of the book."
4,Very Informative,"Taking into consideration that this is a text book and I've only gotten through the first 3 chapters I find it a very informative, in-depth, and readable book. The information is provided in a manner that the average, non-computer, person can understand and absorb. I am an older adult returning to school after 20 years. It is hard to retain almost anything these days but this text makes it easier than most. I won't say its easy, that is a matter of personal opinion, but easier in the sense that you can read a section and still realize that you understand what it is you just read and that it flowed smoothly from the previous section; incorporating previously stated ideas and information while addressing new ones."
2,Not that good,"I watched the movie and it was pretty bad. The story line had possiblities, but the acting and makeup was terrible. It was like watching a home made movie, but in this case you actually pay for the rental. It was less than a Grade B movie in my opinion.It's really too bad, the story had alot of possibilities. But, the finished product was horrid, not horror!"
3,"Good, but far from the best","This is a good recording, the Academy is as polished as usual, and Neville Marriner brings some verve to proceedings, but the singers aren't always up to it. Kiri Te Kanawa, and accomplished Mozartian is excellent as always. But surprisingly, Cherly Studer struggles quite a bit in her Queen of the Night role. Her ""Holle Rache"" aria sounds terribly forced and smackes of tremendous effort. It doesn't have the effortless flow of , say, Sumi Jo in George Solti's excellent production, and her coloratura is quite strained at times.So if you want an outstanding Magic Flute, go with George Solti's. This one's good, but nowhere near Solti's."
5,Brilliant,"A very stylish recording, with a star-studded cast, and orchestra - truly magical. An abolute must have!!"
3,you can't find this anywhere,who knows how good this is. it has been unavailable for almost 2 months.
3,worth a spin or two,"look no further than the very back cover of this album for reference points to Hazel's sound: Heatmiser, Crackerbash. a guitar-driven band that writes some pretty good songs but fails to strike enough of an impact to make me want to devote myself to their band. a good enough listen, overall. it's funny to see the rejected album covers inside the booklet. i def. think that the final cover was the right choice! whew!"
2,Small,"These run really small. I ordered an x-small for my Mal-shi who only weights 4 lbs and it barely fits. Also, very hard to get on."
5,Ergonomic and smooth,"Besides the ""cool"" factor, I'm very glad I've invested in this mouse because it feels so natural in my hand. And now that I don't have to fuss with a cord, I've eliminated the problem of my mouse creeping to the back of my desk and getting stuck when the cord gets under my keyboard.The feel is very smooth, and not at all jerky. note: I'm not a gamer so I can't really comment on its responsiveness but as an avid general computer user, I can highly recommend it."
5,Julian rules,if you like ALW you will love Julian. After listening to this cd you will fall madly in love with him and will stay under his spell forever.
4,Great Lloyd Webber stuff,"If you like the cello and Andrew Lloyd Webber music, you'll love this album. I first listened to this album over 20 years and lost it in a divorce. Great to hear it again."
4,An interesting examination of the seductiveness of cults,"Interesting, a great read for anyone interested in feminist psychology and/or how women are attracted to cults. I respect the author's careful discussion of her methods and her openess. Highly recommended."
3,"Nice Collectible, but not worth the money as play toy","We just set this set up for our sons, and were very disappointed in it. It easily tips over when they try to play with it, and the snapping arm that is supposed to sring spiderman up in the air doesn't snap into place like it says it is supposed to. The piece that hangs off the top for Spiderman to hang from easily falls off, and is basically useless. My boys are making the best of it, but I don't see this toy lasting more than a couple days...it is just very cheaply made."
1,Dissapointed by a decided lack of authenticity,"The description states: ""...the streets of New York City. This playset is designed to look just like an authentic alleyway,"" but I was dissapointed to open the box and discover that this item was not authentic in the least. If this is New York, then where are all the dead hookers? Obviously this alley was modled after a cleaner city that also has giant robotic flip-arms growing out of dumpsters, such as Baltimore.Very dissapointed by it all. You can be sure that when Batman comes over for a visit, Spidey will be giving him a tour of some other portion of the city while this piece remains safely unseen in the back of the shelf."
3,A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"DON'T BLAME THE ANYONE I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THE BOOK WAS TOO OLD. THE INFORMATION WAS OK NOT UPDATED, BUT MY BOOK DID COME ON TIME."
3,"eh, you get what you pay for.","The finish on these is pretty rough. I have one bamboo hook I've used before and loved it, and it did get smoother the more I used it. I'm hoping that these will smooth out, but in the meantime they're not as great as I had hoped. But they were cheap and they're still usable, so I guess you get what you pay for! I'm not really sure I'll use all the sizes, so if I bought them again, I'd probably spend the same amount of money on the few hooks I'll use and get a little better quality."
5,Perfict,These are practically required when using Homespun yarns. There is no snagging of the yarn. Really works great! Love it.
3,"pretty good hooks, but yarn didn't slide easily","These are a good basic crochet hook, with a decently shaped end that catches the yarn satisfactorily, although I had some trouble with the yarn splitting as I finished stitches. (To be fair, the yarn I'm working with right now splits easily.) I received 10 hooks (not 5 like another reviewer) and like the feel of the bamboo. However, when I first tried them the surface was a little tacky (sticky?) and the yarn didn't slide as smoothly as I'd like. We put a light coat of urethane on them (have a spray gun for some construction we're doing out back) and that helped the situation. I still prefer my Susan Bates metal hooks, as they slide easily, catch the yarn firmly, and rarely split. If you like crocheting at a nice sedate pace, and/or prefer the feel of bamboo to the feel of metal, these would do just fine."
4,"Great Hooks, But Incorrect Product Description","This is a great set of crochet hooks for the price. They are quite comfortable to hold, are a good weight, and seem to be well constructed.However, purchasers should be aware that the product description is not accurate. You only receive 5 hooks, ranging in sizes 5.5mm - 9mm (US I-M). The picture does show the five hooks you get, but the description indicates that you will get ""12 PCs bamboo crochet hooks 2.75mm-10.0 mm"". Despite this, I still feel that these hooks are worth the price. A minor annoyance is that the US sizes are NOT laser printed with the metric size, but that can be easily remedied by writing it on each hook with a permanent marker for easy reference.Even with these two complaints, I think the product itself still deserves a four-star rating."
5,Bamboo crochet hooks..the best!,"Hi, I bought this set of crochet hooks and they are even nicer than I expected. They are light,smooth and precise. Shipping was fast, great transaction..Thanks!"
4,Might Not Be Best for Beginners,"I bought these hooks thinking that I could learn on them but the hook part did not necessarily ""hook"" the yarn. It could just be due to my new abilities as a crochet-er. The packaging of the hooks was more than adequate to ensure safety and I think that eventually I wouldn't find any problems with the hooks. The price for the hooks are also decent because you get so many of them in different sizes which turns out to be for many projects in the future."
3,Nice for traveling,"I like the shape and weight of the needles, but they don't full thru the stitch smoothly, not like an aluminum needle. They tend to snag the yarn ."
4,"Subject matter great, book not as good","I read John Niven's biography of Martin Van Buren, and thought it was often dull. This biography is some better, tho there are dull portions, especially some of the pages during the time Chase was Secretary of the Treasury. But the life and the period is so fascinating that I found when I had finished the book that I felt I had really learned a lot. There is no bibliography in the book, tho there are many pages of notes and with work one can deduce therefrom the books consulted. I sure wish the book had a bibliography, since the notes cite various interesting books I'd like to read."
2,Where is the drama? ....,"Professor Niven is a competent and thorough historian, but unfortunately this book is almost unreadable. There are occasional nuggets but they are too few and far between. The author never draws the reader into the story and life of Chase, and instead spends countless pages focusing on a blizzard of details, especially in the earlier years, many of them inconsequential and dull. The last few chapters, including on such dramatic subjects as impeachment and the 1868 presidential election, feel rushed and underwritten in comparison with the laborious treatment of less important earlier events. Blue's book on Chase's political life is much more engaging, even though it hardly touches upon Chase's personal life. I would recommend that book, in conjunction with a reading of Chase's correspondence and journals, over this well-meaning but lifeless tome."
4,Civil War affecanido,Developing a collection of civil war stamps and wrting the history of each and then developing more about the subject is a consuming endeavor. This book is one of about 50 that My husband has read. The collection and the vinyettes and worthy of a copyrighted book in itself.Great book .. However we thought it was a first edition. but it had the author's note and signiture. Good
3,not green,"Packaging shows it to be green, its more like a blue green, heavy on the blue. Make sure you want your hair to be bluish green if you choose to buy it."
4,Good dye,"This is a really good semi-permanent hair dye. Semi-permanent! The color comes beautifully when bleached right, and your hair doesn't have to be bleached white-blonde either. Even on darker hair, it gives it a nice tint of color. I love how it's a vegan dye so you can be happy purchasing it knowing it hasn't been tested on animals or anything. It doesn't feel damaging at all because it's so naturally made. But because it's semi-permanent, it does wash off very quickly. I would recommend this product to anyone who doesn't mind putting in the time and effort to dye your hair every two weeks!"
1,Very misleading photo and color!,"Manic Panic makes great products but be warned: this is NOT GREEN. It is blue with a greenish edge to it, but it is in no way ""forest green."" The photo sure LOOKS green, and the name SOUNDS green, but what I got was most definitely blue. If you want a blue that's on the green side, buy this. But if you actually, you know, want GREEN, keep looking. Very disappointed!"
1,Led Zeppelin - US '77 Tour T-shirt,After waiting 5 days for my item (which is unusually long for Amazon) I checked on the shipping status. And then noticed the following item:Product Features* Note: Women's size t-shirts do NOT have tour dates printed on back.WHAT THE HELL? That's the ONLY reason I purchased this shirt!!If I knew that I would have purchased a mens t-shirt.That REALLY pisses me off!!
5,extraordinary travel writing,"I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about Spain and the Spanish people. The editor have a great knack for selecting extremely interesting and well-written pieces,, none of which are very long, making it a very easy read. You will enjoy this book whether or not you have ever visited Spain, or plan on vacationing there."
1,Dual Cd Player,I had my friend who works on cars for a living install my cd player in my car and it doesn't work. The only thing that worked was the eject button. I've tried to contact the company THREE times and I don't get a clear response on how to get my refund back and now it's been over 1 month and I'm still trying to get an address where to send the cd player back but I get nothing.
5,Highly recommended!,"Johanna reacts candidly to her feelings about having a new baby sister. At first she reserves judgment and does not share her parents' enthusiasm for Jillian who ""spent too much time with Mom."" She progresses to thinking ""maybe having a little sister was going to be ok"" and ultimately to ""I'm lucky she's mine."" The photograph are outstanding: charming, expressive, honest.For an outrageously funny companion book, try Kevin Henkes' ""Julius, the Baby of the World."""
4,A lot of info for a beginner to digest!,"I was curious about Anusara.The DVD was different than I expected.The postures were all familiar to me from my 2 years of basic yoga classes.The teacher talks the whole time, partly about ""keeping your inner body bright"" which I thought was very cool, and partly alignment tips. He does not demonstrate the postures but it was neat to see the variety of bodies in the large class expressing the postures differently. The sun salutation part moves slowly with long holds of lunges, etc while he talks about alignment. The whole thing was so different than my usual practice that it is not realistic for me to practice along with it from beginning to end. However the DVD is very well chaptered and I can try a few chapters at a time and really experiment with the alignment tips that he gives. The devotional aspect of it is very appealing."
2,Not so good,"I think this DVD is not very well done. There is a model who is supposed to show correct alignment, author who only talks and gym full of people who try to follow the model. That is not as bad as the fact that camera very rarely shows the model. Most of the time, you can see either the author or crowd. If you have not practiced yoga before, you won't have any clue how to make position he is asking you to do. Instead of this DVD I highly recommend DVD of his student: Desiree Rumbaugh (""Yoga to The Rescue - Feel Good from Head to Toe""). She perfectly shows ever pose. While you watch her DVD, you do not question yourself if you are doing it the right way. She shows what is right way and what is wrong one."
1,Gluten alert!!! Contains wheat!!,"I read the description in detail, but not the reviews, which I usually read. Another buyer noted these contain wheat and I missed it!! Indeed, this product contains wheat! We will try to take a picture of the label and upload it.2 of us have already taken it, and this is dangerous! Amazon, fix it!Here is the link to the description on the Source Naturals website. It is the same as what is on the label.[...]"
4,"Beautiful, but extremely heavy","I bought this pan for my new induction stove top but ended up returning it, because it is much too heavy to be useful or to flip its content around. A beautiful design and extremely solid otherwise. I wish they would make a 10 inch version of it..."
2,Just ok,"Margarita has a great voice, song choices were not that good. Only liked one song. Some of the classics should have been included to make this a good CD."
2,"Great Idea, poor execution","I bought this to extend my router above the table for easy bit changes and to ditch the wrenches that came with my Bosch router. After installing it and using just basic straight spiral bits it seemed to work just fine. It was when I tried larger profile bits when the problems started. The vibration was terrible and I was just using a 1/4"" round over bit with a 1/2"" shank. I decided to try a smaller 3/16"" round over but this one had a 1/4"" shank which meant I had to use a reducer, well I had the same vibration/run out and when I tried to remove the bit it was stuck. I had to disassemble the router and take the chuck apart and push the bit through from the under side to get it out. Too much of a pain and the vibration/run out seemed really unsafe, looks like this might be poor quality control...$50 bucks in the trash! Live and learn I guess"
4,Whoops! There goes the postage.,"No issues with this vendor or product. It's just irritating when they set X price, really too low, with an obviously high shipping and handling to make up the difference."
4,This is big enough for me,"This mitt works fine for me. I was worried that the size would be too small after reading the previous review. I don't have forearms as big as Popeye, but I am a 300 pound man and I have no problem with the fit of this mitt. This mitt really comes in handy when I'm dumping the hot coals into the grill."
1,burned through after 2 weeks,"Do yourself a favor and buy a real heavy duty BBQ mitt. This one looks nice and fits well, but it starting burning one night and I threw it out."
1,Not Heavy Duty,"This is the second Weber Mitt that I've tried. They both burned through within two weeks. There are other, heavier-duty mitts avaiable that will last a lot longer."
2,Narrow Fit,"While the mitt is beautiful and the price is right, it is narrow. Most mitts flare towards the opening, this one does not. I have larger forearms and it won't fit all the way up. My husband has average sized arms and it won't go around his upper forearm either. Since they are so long they go almost to your elbow."
5,Magic Mitten,"Great shipper, fast shipper and great item. It provides a lot of coverage on the forearm for protection against heat."
2,Weird size,"My husband likes this mitt, but I can't stand it. It fits my hand really strange and is really tight and goes high up on the arm. It's just cut really strange."
3,just another long mitt,"I own this mitt, but rarely use it because I find it too long for my female arm... its clumsy"
2,Light weight,"This mitt is adequate for shaking or quickly moving metal items around on the grill. Don't try to take a hot pan or skewer more than about ten feet, or it will burn your hand through the material."
2,"Weber Barbecue Mitt, too stiff to be useful","I found the mitt to be too stiff to be of any real use. You can't really pick up or handle any utensils with the mit on. You can move hot plates, etc. but you can't really carry anything with the mitt on. Not worth the money albeit not very expensive."
2,Subtle but in the end entertaining,"Definitely not the best Doctor Who Missing Adventure, but it's got its good points. The story moves slowly, and there's not much action. The resolution of the chief bad guy's fate is a little bit of a letdown.If you're a fast reader who doesn't mind a more slow-moving story, go ahead. If not, don't be afraid to skip this one."
2,Too clever and complex for its own good,"The Doctor takes Jo and Mike Yates for a spin in the TARDIS, aiming for the planet Karfel (which the Doctor and Jo had visited, according to the story 'Timelash') but, given how awful the other story set on Karfel was, end up instead on the planet Nooma. I'm not sure, though, that this destination is any better.This story is full of strange alien races and serious bodily transformations, especially for one of the regulars. And with any such transformations, the return to normal afterwards is a difficult thing to believe.The society of Nooma also causes me some difficulty. I have a problem with so many intelligent races evolving side by side, even with the ""explanation"" that is offered as part of the book's resolution.Something simpler would have been better. Getting too complex just leads to trouble."
3,Hubbard...or not?,"Halfway through volume 8, 'Disaster', the narrator of the previous 7 1/2 volumes, Gris, finishes his story. Why does Mission Earth continue for another 2 1/2 books? Beats me.There's a new narrator now, and the author's voice is astonishingly different. The reader can catch him using passive tense in several points, and the writing isn't as fluent as Hubbard's was. Say what you will about this series, it's remarkable readable. All this leads me to believe it wasn't really Hubbard finishing up the series. Hubbard died in 86 or so, supposedly after he finished this series. With no evidence whatsoever, I believe the final 2 1/2 books were ghostwritten.This volume is entertaining. Gris finally gets what he deserves. It's fun to see Heller cleaning up the galaxy."
4,"Not my favorite volume so far, but stil compelling!","In this book, it really seems like the story is coming to an end, instead here's still so much to read!!! Gris, the bad guy, who has been narrating so far, is now now longer in the right position to keep narrating, nor does he know certain aspects of how the story develops, so the writer, very surprisingly, switches narrator! It's hard to get accustomed to a new one, after having read 7 and half book narrated by Soltan Gris, with his dark humor and so on, this narrator is completely different... but I don't want to spoil the surprise. Let's just say that this narrator, thought in a different way and with a different writing style, can still tell you what happened! and keep you glued to the book! I cannot wait to get the next 2 volumes in the mail!"
3,Good Mac iBook,"This iBook arrived with a keyboard problem, but I was able to get it fixed for free, because it was still under warranty. Originally seller wasn't of much help with this problem, but I got it fixed locally. Works just fine now."
5,Used iBook G4/800,"Bought this for my 7 year old grandson and both of us are very happy with it. Looks like new and runs great. They even did a system upgrade at no extra charge, which was a nice surprise. Delivery was better than expected. I will definitely do this again when my other grandson is ready for his first computer."
4,a different view,"I think the previous reviewer is a little harsh. I would call the quality of the projects ""varied"", which is to be expected when there are 20 different designers. I thought most were ho-hum, but a few quite nice, including the eyeglass case on the cover. I think ""grade-school level"" is an exaggeration--most of the projects are fairly simple, but some show interesting techniques and/or would be suitable for a beginning (adult) quilter, especially one who doesn't necessarily want to tackle a bed-size quilt. Also, instructions are clear and templates are provided--I've definitely seen ""project"" books that are a lot worse!"
2,shows are very short ( 2 mins each),Not long enough to get into the story..... Not the way is was on TV broadcast. Not recomended because of the shortness of story lines.
3,"A good ""GENERAL"" chemistry book","In first semester course general chemistry (I am studying biology)it is a quite good to excellent book for reviewing all the general chemistry stuff you need. But the math standard in the book doesn't match with the German math standard at German Universities. Most math examples are very confusing and don't make sense to me. I always calculate those differently. So I use mathematical exercises from other european or german text books. But in my eyes it is a very good book to read, and learn all the basics in chemistry."
4,Weber Vinyl Cover,"The material is nice and thick, but it only covers the top half of the grill. The picture shown on amazon.com is deceiving, it looks like it covers most of the grill, when it really does not.The side vents just below the grill's metal lid are still exposed even with the cover on, which means any smell can emanate out and into your vehicle's trunk if you're travelling.I just clean my grill before travelling and I use a large plastic bag to cover the whole grill. No smell in my trunk. The black cover is fine for protecting rain & dust outdoors. I rate it 4 stars because the cover could have improved, but it's worth the $7.00 I paid on amazon."
2,Not for the traveling BBQr,"If you are planning on leaving your Weber Q in one spot then this is the cover for you, however, if you are like me and bought this grill to take traveling with you, then this is not the grill for you. It is cheaply made and does not fully cover the BBQ which when traveling allows the debries at the bottom of the grill to come out and dirty and stain your storage area. Overall this cover is cheap for a reason, spend the extra money and get the doufel bad, because you will be disappointed with this."
5,A must have for the Weber Q 220,"Purchased this to protect my investment - a Weber Q220 portable grill (see reviews). Cover is awesome meaning it is thick, takes abrasion, fits the grill perfectly, looks great, keeps the grill clean and dry. A must have product!"
1,Beware,"I bought this product for 9.99, returned it and was only refunded 4.99. Seller has ignored repeated requests for an explanation."
3,Good Grill cover,This cover protects the grill well and keeps the elements out. For some reason bugs like to liver under it which is a little annoying. It is a very tight fit which is mostly good but it does take a little doing to get it off.
5,Well-made grill cover,"This cover for the Baby Q is made of heavier material than other covers I have bought previously. You can adjust the bottom tightness, which allows you to cinch the cover down around the bottom of the grill."
3,Eeeh,"I'm not a cover kind of guy, and our grill is on the covered patio so I don't use the cover. Maybe it'll come in handy over the winter when we seldom use the grill?"
4,Good for price,"This is a study grill cover for my Weber 200 grill. For $8, you can't beat the price. Sure, it isn't perfectly designed to fit over the gas adjustment knob, but it will still cover the entire upper grill. The grill feet is exposed. There is elastic band at the bottom of the cover to help keep a snug fit on the grill."
1,Wanted to buy this but....,"Nat Nast and about a hundred other Amazon retailers should be ashamed at not being willing to ship to US forces postal addresses. Hundreds of thousands of US military and government civilians rely on Amazon (who does ship their own products to APOs) However the Amazon retailers who refuse to alter their shipping contracts (i.e. will only use UPS instead of USPS) totally suck! Be real, take our money and try being a little patriotic instead of selfish and cheap!"
2,Time,I have one of the original toss and chops. I have bought several as gifts. I recently purchased one for my office and the craftmanship is not the same. After a week the spring fell out. They need to go back to the original quality.
4,"Great, minus one Exception.","I got this book because I needed ideas for face painting. The book itself is awesome. Many different animals to choose from, with great step-by-step instructions for each.However, The negative comes in with the paints themselves. I only used them once, painting a panda's face. They were on for about 3 hours before we attempted to remove them, without luck. Nothing we tried would get the paints off -- Water, Soap, Etc.Eventually, it did come off, for the most part, however, the child was left with a black stain on his nose for quite a while afterwards.To sum it up, buy the book, but use other paints."
4,"Great Concept, OK Book","I agree with Denise Linn's approach to the topics of altars and sacred space. I learned some things from this book, and it gave me some issues to think through in my own life. But I was disappointed with the book at the same time. I didn't enjoy the pictures, and was left with a hungry feeling at the end. I've read many books about altars, and this is the best one so far, but isn't the gem I had expected (wanted) it to be."
5,Beautiful,This is a book of photographs of different types of altars. I found the book to be well written and arranged in a simple yet concise manner which allows the reader to explore the different altars and symbolism behind them. This book is recommended to those people who build altars or who are interested in altar building as part of their spiritual path.
1,Permanent Docking Kit,"I did not keep this item as I found out that, though blue-tooth enabled, it could not be upgraded for other blue tooth telephones and only could work with only one telephone model. A new kit is to be released shortly and I opted to wait. In addition, it is possibly not compatible with fibreoptic speaker wiring used in Mercedes Benz sound system."
3,its ok,The main reason that I bought this mount is so that the TomTom could talk through the car stereo speakers. Since I have all aftermarket stuff it didn't work so well. The TomTom box adds so much noise to my system that I don't even use it. I just use it for power on/off and headlight auto dim control.
2,"Picture incorrect, beware the quantity","I now understand the first reviewer's comment. I admit some fault for not paying close enough attention, but looking at the picture of a box where it shows the quantity as '12', I thought I was getting 12 tubes with five erasers each. No, I got no box, just one tube of five erasers, which at the time I bought it was $3.30. But hey, if I didn't make mistakes, I wouldn't be trying to buy erasers in bulk.The eraser quality is okay, though I find them to be a bit hard. I wish it was easier to find decent replacement erasers in quantity at a reasonable price. I don't think these are worth the cost, you might as well be buying all new pencils."
2,Paper Mate Tuff Stuff Eraser,"Disappointed with the actual product compared to the picture displayed when researching the item. Correct item, just display is not accurate."
3,"Good, but source code needs improvement",An otherwise good data structures book is hampered by some occasionally sloppy code that sometimes won't compile with the GNU compiler. There are other first-edition type problems including two identical illustrations purportedly depicting two different graph spanning tree traversals. Hopefully these problems will be fixed in the upcoming second edition. I'm also a little curious as to why the authors wrote and included their own code instead of using the c++ standard template library.
2,Not as good as the first,"I really looked forward to downloading this one. I ended up not reading it. I just wasn't sure that I wanted to spend my time with this subject matter. I may go back to it, but doubtful"
1,Like everything Milwaukee is selling now (junk),Finish quality of this driver was terrible. I kept it because it was so cheap it wasn't worth paying return shipping.
2,Get on with it already......,"I love time travels... I love basic good plots, no confusion, more emotional interplay. This book Swan's Way, I really tried to like it, and I did until a 3/4 the way into it. All right already, get married.... Is the father a true southern jerk, or not. If my review is confusing, then don't read the book. It really could have been a great book. But it wasn't, and I got a real headache from reading it."
2,Cover Does Not Fit,"I love my Weber Summit grill unconditionally. However, this cover is a true disappointment. It fit the grill perfectly for the first 2 years. After starting the 3rd grilling season, I noticed that it had shrunk significantly and does not fit the grill anymore. Yes - very strange, the cover has remained intact, like the day it was purchased. It just doesn't fit anymore and I am afraid it will tear trying to pull it tightly over the unit. I checked with Weber as I am not interested in another $50+ outlay to replace the cover. They stated the cover is only warranted for 2 years and won't issue a replacement. Based on my experience, I would not recommend buying this cover."
2,Grill Cover a Disappointment,"Like other reviews, I too have a problem with my Weber Summit Silver grill cover shrinking after about 4 years of purchase. It will no longer fit! Who would have thought that a ""vinyl"" cover would shrink to such a degree? The poor grill cover quality is a negative reflection on the reputation of the Weber brand name and its products."
5,Easily Worth the Extra Money,"I purchased my Summit Series grill about 3 years ago from Sears and through recommendations on Amazon bought a 'cheaper' grill cover that other reviews promised worked just as well as the more expensive Weber cover. In short it didn't make it through the season, so I bit down and purchased the Premium Weber cover. Do not waste your time and money buying anything but the correct Weber Premium Cover for your Weber grill. My cover has been through the remainder of a Denver winter and 2 years outside in Dallas, TX. The cover is as easy to remove and put back on today as it was when new. Additionally the cover has never come off in storms and with a quick cleaning with the hose looks almost as good as new.At $45, or whatever the current price is listed as, it is cheap insurance for your grill!"
5,Brian regan: The Epitome of Hyperbole,"Brian Regan is always funny, and there are many laughs in this one. It was so enjoyable that it went by really fast for me, and seemed much shorter than its 45 minutes. He has the talent for making every-day things that everyone experiences very funny. Props to Mr. Regan!"
3,Predictable and Less Family Friendly,"Too much re-tooled material. There are some very funny moments, but very predictable if you are familiar with Brian's work. Less family friendly due to his use of blasphemy."
1,Brian Regan: NOT FUNNY.,"Brian Regan is just plain NOT FUNNY. This is an hour of jaw-clenching monotony punctuated by stupid voices. Shoot, recited entirely by stupid voices. Sure, he's PG, but if you're looking for a clean talented comedian try Jim Gaffigan. Or if you want to live a little, check out the hardest working comedian in the business: Louis C.K. MUCH better (i.e. actually funny)."
2,Boring,It simply wasn't funny. We may have chucked once or twice. Though it is mostly clean humor if that is what you are looking for.
3,Brian Rocks a bit too quickly,"Good stuff - however, for the money, the running time is too short. A disappointment in that department."
2,His worst special,"This one special in particular was very poor. He even got a little razzled when someone from the audience chimed in - it completely threw him off his game for a couple of minutes. You'd think if you're a stand-up you'd be able to take some audience participation, but he couldn't handle it.I've seen one other special of his, and that one had more balance and some good stories. This special on the other hand, was contriving one scenario after another which gave him an excuse to make that same face over and over again. It just wasn't good. Making a funny face can add to your special, but the special shouldn't revolve around you making a funny face."
2,not up to standards,"i love brian regan stand up, the guy is seriously funny, but this is like 45 minutes of his mediocre material, it's not bad but it's not nearly as funny as any of his other specials, get ""i walked on the moon"" or his last comedy central special if you want some great regan stuff"
4,Still funny...,"I have seen one one Brian's earlier videos, which was very funny. He continues this with new material still suited for the family. Includes bonus features."
4,good show but no different from the special,"A while back I watched the special when it aired on Comedy Central and I loved it, so I picked the dvd up with the hope of the it having an extended version or a few extras on it. There is a little behind the scenes making of video that has a couple laughs in it, but nothing really all that special. And there isn't much on the dvd that you didn't see on the aired version except for a couple extended jokes and the very brief encore. All in all I'm still quite happy for picking it up because Brian Regan is a fantastic comedian and well worth checking out."
5,brilliant,Brian is hilarious and I would highly recommend him to anyone who likes stand-up.His facial expressions and physical actions are as funny as his jokes.
5,Love this guy!,"Brian Regan is a talented comdedian! Someone you can watch with the whole family and not worry about inappropriate or vulgar 'humor.' I got a couple of his DVD's for my hubby's birthday, and he loved them. Be sure and watch all the extra footage after the main show. There's some great ones in there."
1,"Anyway,I don't like this","I laughed when I saw the review who's telling that the drummer for Hazel is weak and sounds as the drummer for White Stripes.I'm not agree that this is a music for MTV kids,but certainly it is not interesting and seems just very commercial.Actually,I think that if Jack White will need another drummer,maybe can look at Hazel - this is not far as sound."
1,Drummer?,The drummer for Hazel is ridiculous.She's weak.She seems the drummer for White Stripes.I think this music is for MTV kids.
5,"Fantastic voice (Norman), warm, perfect to represent Carmen.","Excellent recording despite 10 years of age. Norman is perfect in the role. Sound is great and true. Interpretation is excellent and French words can be understood at many occasion, which is not always so easy. Listen to it at loud volume !"
1,"Jessye, I love you but a Carmen you're not","I just listened to a snippet from the confrontation duet in the last act, and you and he are singing two different operas, you more Alceste. You are too classy a lady to sing this role. But your voice is dependably seductive."
3,The last one got fryed,I left my last Bosch charger on for a week and the transformer on the circuit board melted. I found the same model on amazon.com and ordered it. It came in 2 days. That's faster than a letter. So far so good. I'm unplugging the charger when not in use and I expect no further problems.
3,Is OK,"While this works okay when pushing down, my 95 year old wants to pull up with it and that just doesn't work. Also, she has trouble lifting her arms and sits in the door frame a little too high for her reach when sitting in the wheelchair to try to transfer to the car."
5,Great product,The handle makes it so much easier to get in and out of the car. I wish I had known about it much sooner. No problem to store it as it fits easily in the glove compartment.
5,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This product is wonderful. I recommend it to anyone having trouble getting out of a car. We have a Navigator with running boards that came out when you open the door. The problem was that it was still too high to step on the ground. With this handle I have all the support I need to get out. I love it.
5,Very helpful tool,"After reading other reviews, I purchased this for a friend that has a hard time getting out of small vehicles. Wow! This small tool does a great job. There is no assembly required so it is very easy to insert/remove from the door buckle. Catching a ride with a friend, no problem. Carry it with you wherever you go."
5,an enormous assist for anyone with even minor mobility issues,"My handybar was a gift to me, and I found it so useful that I ordered one to give to a friend who also has mobility issues entering and exiting a car. I wish manufacturer stressed the use of getting into and out of a car. It is so much more than an auto glass smasher and seat belt cutter. Directions for use of this device could also use a good edit. But...bottom line...it works splendidly"
5,Reassuring device,The Handybar device is reassuring to someone who needs a little support getting into and out of a vehicle independently. It inserts easily when needed and feels stable and secure to the user.
3,Not so great as I thought,"I opted for the Handybar with the added features of seat belt cutter and window breaker.Thought having those attributes available in the car would be a good idea even if the grab design wasn't that great.I drive a van and have major mobility problems due to spinal arthritis.When I put the Handybar in the door hook on the driver's side, naturally, it was on my left. Since I am right-handed, it wasn't comfortable using my left hand for support as I pushed-off the driver's seat.Not having tried it on the passenger side, I can't comment on its efficiency there.Of course, if the driver is left-handed, it would be perfect.However, I do think the length of the handle could be a little longer for better leverage."
4,A great help,"This handle is super easy to use and is a great help to our 86 year old mothers to get in and out of our car. It helps them most when getting out of the car because they can turn their bodies and put one hand on the handle and one on the car door and stand up. Getting IN the car, it's a little harder, but still helps."
4,it works,I bought for my dad. he says it works well and he is happy. he says it helps him get in the car as well
4,Good little helper,"Very sturdy product, easy to use for exiting vehicle; tends to get in the way when entering."
3,A Gift,"I gave this as a gift, and I have not had any response from the recipient. A ninety-two year old friend recommended it, however. She loves it!"
5,Handybar user,Our medical practice has 5 passenger vans used to transport the elderly for out-patient surgery procedures. Many have both joint and/or balance issues. Handybar gives the added support and confidence to transition from ground level up and onto a step or running board for van entry and exit...GREAT PRODUCT !!!
3,Stander Handy bar,I purchased this helper for my Mom I think it is a good idea but for my van is is a little to short to really help as much as we need. It dose give her a handle to help reposition herself once in the van.
5,Standers Handybar,What a great product. It definitely helps getting out of the car. I am going to keep this product in mind for gifts for my friends.
4,A little extra support,The Standers Handybar gives my mom something to grab onto as she transfers from the wheelchair to the car. She doesn't travel without it!
5,Great Standers Handybar !!!,Excellent ! Helps my mother get in and out of the car safely !A Great find for any one who wants to feel a little more secure.
3,Not for us,"This is exacly as described, but it turns out not to be for us. My wife needs to transfer to and from wheel chair to car seat. What she needs is a support on the other side of the door. Where this device is placed puts it in her way getting in and out. For someone transferring to and from a standing position it would be fine. We could have looked more carefully at the photo before ordering."
5,much more than I expected,"I purchased this for someone with severe leg weakness that made getting in and out of the car was very difficult. I was skeptical and thought perhaps the product would be flimsy and easily broken. NOT SO!! It is extremely well made and very sturdy. It fits firmly in the ""u"" shaped bracket in the door, and provides perfect support. When placed in the ""u"" bracket in the car door, it is just the right height to grasp for support. I find that now I only need to help a little. It is a win-win for both of us, and makes exiting the vehicle so much safer. I would recommend it to anyone needing assistance getting out of the car."
5,HandyBar,It does what I needed it to do. Very good product. Would recommend to my friends. Without this item I wouldn't beable to get in or out of my car or truck. Thanks Roy
4,Songs of libations and violence,"This posthumous compilation is culled from 2 albums released in the late 80s by this Austin, Texas based punk band. If you like authentic, non-pretentious, non-commercial music (what Allen Freed called ""rock and roll""), you should appreciate this CD. Many of the songs here are covers done with an approach that shows that basically there's not that basically the same thing. Like the great John Lee Hooker-Canned Heat recordings, the blues songs by Poison 13 challenge the form with the best results. Not that the CD is all blues. These covers can be seen to be in their own creativity by reverentially adhering to tradition. They reflect on the past with a mixture of reverence and contempt. Like James Dean they lived fast, died young, and left a good-looking corpse. The songs are full of morbid humour, grating vocals, and dirty, distorted guitars. Get this while it is still in print! END"
5,High Quality Sound--A Visit to 1931,"The Cocoanut Grove series was made from rented large record disks; radio stations would rent the privelege of one play only, then send the disk back. As a result, these disks are virtually mint, and with modern technology the sound quality is remarkable considering the era.Gus Arnheim's Orchestra reflects the era, as symphonic jazz became more orchestrated with a more sober sound brought on by the Depression. Soloist Loyce Whitman displays her exceptional voice, as do the male soloists and The Three Ambassadors trio (similar to the Rhythm boys of Paul Whitman).If you enjoy vintage music from this era, you will love this CD."
5,Who are the real 'wumps'?,Cute characters giving a very strong message about looking after the planet. Great way to introduce young children to having an environmental conscience. Highly recommended.
1,The Wump World,I love everything Bill Pete ever wrote - except this book. And I'm an environmentalist! There is nothing joyful or entertaining within the pages of this entire book and kids' books need that so kids will want to read them again and again and grow to love to read. You can teach kids to take care of their world without inventing a creature and giving it a horrible existence to pound a kid over the head with the fact that we're passing on to them a damaged world.
2,A Grump About The Wumps,"I hold Bill Peet in the highest regards and have nothing but praise for his many-splendored works, however, I must say this book is one of his most forgettable. The overriding environmental message completely upstages any of the supporting cast, which feel suspiciously contrived to me, as if they were thrown together purely to fascilitate the less-than-subtle message of the story. If you're on the fench between getting this book or another, I'd recommend taking a pass on The Wump World."
1,Lousy,"Nearly all of Bill Peet's books are wonderful; this one is total crap. It is a hyper-political, enviro-fascist screed. There are a number of such ridiculous efforts, including Dr. Seuss' The Lorax. They are nothing more than a sign of the times. Just as millions of dim-witted slack-jawed followers fell in line behind Gore's fanciful ""An Inconvenient Truth"", so did millions of their parents in the early 70s with the publication of such absurd efforts as ""Silver Spring.""Some will read these books to their children because they are propagandists and want to fill their children's heads with nonsense. Those of us who want our children to know the truth and be able to think critically about serious matters will not put this trash before them."
1,Not Peet's best,"Disappointed in this book... not a fun read at all, a stretch to call the ending 'happy'. Clearly trying to indoctrinate the young reader (listener)into environmental paranoia. Thumbs down."
3,Spinner briefcase feedback,"This is a nice spinner bag. It is smaller than I expected because my previous bag from Samsonite was larger. One area I do have frustration with the bag is when I open the back compartment where the laptop is (and this may bother me because I fly so much), but in order to get the laptop out I need to fully unzip both sides and really spread it open to get the laptop out. With my old bag I did not have to do this. I am a road warrior, so it's too early to tell how the wheels and structure of the bag will hold up, but for now I am happy with it."
4,perfect traveler,"This is a bag that I just enjoy. It holds everything I need, and more. I bought it to replace my backpack as I was finding it difficult to carry everywhere. This samsonite with its four wheels just moves as I move, and sometimes faster! Great choice! I am happy with this choice"
5,Great case,Case was a present and she rerally likes it. It is hard for it fit under the seat on a plane but outside of that its awesome
4,Schenker still one of the greatest!,Okay I'm a big MSG fan. I just saw MSG in Hollywood & hisguitar playing was still amazing. I admit I didn't listento much of his music in 2000 but I am now and I'm sorry Ididn't! The music is almost as good as his latest reunionwith Barden & I think has that classic 80' sound. The songson here a good selection of all his work. I think it showsjust how good his songwriting is even without Barden. Thesingers are good for some of the material but Barden's thevoice. He isn't missed here though. The band plays great!I love the production one camera angle with close ups. Ifeel like I'm watching it live. I know some of you don'tlike it but I buy many bootlegs of all the bands I listentoo for the live experience. No overdubs! I think the cheapproduction makes it more a live show. I think it's great!
2,That's all you get...,"When you pay only seventeen dollars for a double-DVD featuring two shows, unfortunately you can not expect great sound and image quality. Schenker is not wildely recognized for great efforts in asssuring the quality of his video releases (maybe his fault, maybe record company's fault, I don't know...) And the guy has been going through a lot, I mean, a LOT of personal and financial troubles, so I don't think people do not even seek his opinions berfore releasing these products...And we, resoluted fans from an artist actually virtually unknown in America, are forced to accpet these below-standard merchandise, because it's the only way to see / hear the Master live."
1,This is wrong!!!,"No matter the causes, or the resources of the artist involved, no matter what, an official release of a live concert could never, NEVER, feature a concert filmed using only ONE CAMERA!! This is cheating, this is wrong. I'm a huge fan of Schenker, have almost all of his records (quite a hard work obtaining some of them!), but can't forgive him (or probably his record company) for releasing such a cheap product."
3,For Jessye's fans only,"I was extremely disappointed with this set. I had anticipated that Norman would be a great Leonore, and if you get past her stately approach to the role, for sheer vocal glory she is unmatched on records--only the young Flagstad would have surpassed her, but Flagstad didn't record the role until late in her career.Sadly, nothing else is much good here. Haitink lapses into weak rhythms and a general sense of lassitude that perplexes me. That flaw alone wouldn't be enough to sink the production, but then there is the thin, nasal voice of Reiner Goldberg, who is nowhere close to being an adequate Florestan. He sounds like Norman's lapdog, despite his desperate efforts to beef up his tone when they sing togehter.All in all, a major letdown and a grievously missed opportunity."
1,Axis Ax-1300 Shaver - Looks good but gives a poor shave,"I purchased the AX-1300 2 months ago because I was looking for a good quality shaver that runs on AA batteries. I have tried the Remington Travel Shaver as well as the Braun 370 Pocket Go Shaver (each costing about $18.00) and found they required multiple passes to get all the facial hair cut. Given the prices of these shavers that was not a surprise. I was hoping that by spending more I would get a better quality shaver that gave a better quality shave. Unfortunately that was not the case. The AX-1300 shave quality is about the same as the much cheaper Remington and Braun shavers. I have followed the directions exactly was well as other ways (shaving with Lectric Shave, wet, dry etc...). The results are the same. I have to conclude that as a shaver the AX-1300 is not worth the extra $30.00 - $40.00.As far as durability time will tell. The AX-1300 does seem to be better built and fits well in the hand."
2,Too many errors to be trusted,"I own quite a few Corvette books and have a modest working knowledge of Corvettes and Corvette history. This book was disappointing because it contains errors. Some of the photograph captions referred to a particular year Corvette, but the picture shown was not the correct year. I also found multiple errors in the text, which makes me doubt the accuracy of the data that I do not personally know. I suggest that the Black Book is a better, more accurate, reference. If you want a coffee table book with Corvette pictures, this might do. If you want an authoratative reference work, this is not the one to own."
3,Works fine,"Ordered this to drive with 2 bikes to the beach - a little over 200 miles away. The compatibility chart that came with this was for another bike rack *eye roll* but it fit on my 1993 Acura Legend with some coaxing. I don't see how this would fit 3 bikes, but 2 were fine. Held fine to the beach with 1 stop halfway to re-tighten the straps. On the way back, my husband was lazy about stopping and the rack almost came off when we were a mile from our home - so please, stop every 100 miles to tighten the straps if you are driving long distances.I had a big grievance soon after I bought this because it is sold way cheaper at Toys R Us."
4,Very useful,Happy with this rack though sometimes it is difficult to mount three bikes at once. Gets our bikes to the park and back. Several years of great use.
4,fast read some of the very best pictures,"Does not go into much detail but covers all areas of habits, feeding, mating, attracting, and some history.The pictures are delightful."
5,I am fascinated by hummingbirds,"This is a beautiful book - one that should be left on your coffee table for display. The pictures and colors are so vivid. It's amazing how close up the pictures are. Also, I had no idea there were so many different hummingbirds from all kinds of different places!"
4,Tasty and easier,"We purchased this roaster for my father. He made an excellent chicken with it last weekend. It provides a nice sturdy base to set your chicken on and allows you to add veggies, beer, wine, etc very easily. I was very impressed on how it held and chicken and the ease of removing the chicken once done cooking. We have a very cheep ""beer-in-the-butt"" holder and the Weber Roaster was much more stable and easy to use. I do not give it 5 stars because it set the chicken so high, the lid to my fathers Weber Charcoal Grill would not fit. However, he was able to rig a smaller grill rack to sit lower in the grill and it cooked fine.We had great chicken."
4,Best chicken ever,"This works great and is relatively easy to clean. It works in the oven too. The only tip I'd give users is to grease any part of it that will be touching chicken with oil or shortening for easy cleanup & removal of the chicken. If using in the oven, you might want to place the whole thing inside a roasting pan to prevent drips. Also, medium to large sized chickens (5-7lb) will NOT fit in a standard Weber kettle grill with this roaster - it's too tall."
5,Beer Can Chicken,Man what a awesome weber item.. It cooked the chicken so well and for clean up was a charm. I think Im planning to buy another to cook two birds at once.
1,Don't waste your money on this book!,"Yet another example of the drivel put out by the Llewellyn pulp-mill. Ceremonial magicians should stick to the Kaballa, and Christians (which this guy obviously is) probably should not be dabbling in Runic magic, anyway. The item I found most offensive in this book was the assertion that since Isa is ""treacherous and deceptive"" it therefore MUST be feminine. Sorry dude, WRONG MYTHOLOGY!!!"
2,Stop at Chapter 4,"The first three chapters would be quite a reasonable introduction to an esoteric book on runes for casual reading. From there on it becomes a strange monotheistic parody of Northern lore. Drawing heavily from a Judeo-Christian religious perspective, and 19th century style ceremonial magic, itself of mainly Hebrew origin, it is easy to see how it offends many Asatruar. There is little of the Northern Heathen flavour left.Some have asked how Thorsson could recommend it to his followers on the back cover. Apart from the obvious Llewellyn connection, Western ceremonial is a large part of the basis of Thorsson's own neo-satanic or Setian training. The two systems are two sides of the same coin.The book may be useful as an easy introduction to runes for those who are only familiar with ceremonial magic, but as a Heathen, I would prefer them to make the effort to look at the runes without the Judeo-Christian indoctrination.SweynThe Rune Primer"
1,Very Sad,This book is not a good book on runes. First off the gods and gossesses do not need some christian lord to rule over them. They are not unpredictable demons. You cant just go bossing Odin around. Plus he shows very little wisdom on the runes. There are better books out there on the runes.
1,Wtf? This is really bizarre,I've seen a lot of rune books but I've never seen one where you 'banished' Odin in the ritual in the name of the nameless one.What's the nameless one exactly? Is it the Christian Diety or Cthulu?What's a wiccan pentacle doing in norse ritual work?And 7 planets spread with runes? What's that about?
4,its a good one but with installing problems,"as one of the reviewer said, there is installation problem with the cd but you can still work with it. other wise no other problemthe other problem with package is that you need to register talk to me software and i was not able to register it and I cant use talk to me software."
2,Nothing special. Imax deserves something better.,"This documentary needs badly a better direction and focus. There's nothing here we have not seen in the Discovery Channel. Furthermore the pace is slow, the story bland and repetitive (how many times must we show wonder for a senior cientist?)and the resources such as Imax film are wasted. If you want to watch something spectacular, try Ray Macgillivray's The Living Seas, Imax-Alaska or Africa-The Serengeti. Buy this only if you want to complete your Imax Dvd Library."
3,Too much above water filming,"Although the shark footage is great. I was hoping that there would be more actual footage of sharks. Much of the movie seamed to focus upon the researchers looking for the sharks, instead of the sharks themselves."
3,This Could Have Been Better,"I really expect a lot more effort from IMAX when it comes to documentaries, and I feel somewhat confused with Search for the Great Sharks. Too much emphasis is placed on acting and scenes that are supposed to startle the viewer. I do like the footage of the whale shark, but everything else is out of place. For a film that advertises a grand search for sharks, it gives the viewer something similar to a silly journey."
1,Don't waste your money,"What a waste. People will try to make a buck on anything.Common sense being packaged and sold. Antiquated ideas the writer is probably in his 90's. I should not have wasted my hard earned money.Better to read Bruce Buschel's ""100 Things Restaurant Staffers Should Never Do"" Online."
5,"Plain, good design","I've owned these tongs for 3 years now, and I gotta say that I love them. They are very easy to clean, don't have sharp edges (which can fall and hurt children, dogs, chefs, etc.), and are perfectly designed to match the Weber Q. Highly recommended."
2,Bad tongs,Tongs have no teeth to grab the food. If your food has any suace like BBQ sauce often used when grilling it is very difficult to grab it. If you can grab it then the food will then slide right out unless you really grab it hard. Finally you will probably squeeze the juice right out of it. The spatula might be worth the $10 alone and then trash the tongs.
5,Super tools for the Weber Q200!,"I recently lost my Weber Q100 (someone liberated it from me when I was out of town) and I had liked it so much that I bought it's bigger brother, the Q200 to replace it. The first accessory I bought for my new grill was this set of tools and I am glad that I did.They fit under the shelf and can be stored inside the Weber grill itself when the shelves are folded in and the lid is closed. Talk about convenient! All one needs for most grilling sessions is a good pair of tongs and a spatula. Yes, I own higher quality BBQ tools but these are very useable and a good value considering the price. The best thing about them is that they will alway be right where I need them to be. They seem sturdy and well built.If you own a Weber Q200, Q220 or if you added the optional shelves to your Q100 you will appreciate these compact, stowable utensils."
3,Weber Q grill accessories,"These come with pre-drilled with holes in the middle on the handles that allow them to hang on the weber q grill cart, but that don't hang all that great if you ask me. They are still nice looking though."
2,Deception,The tools pictured are not the tools that I recieved. Instead I recieved a different set of Webber tongs and spatula. They are OK but not the same as the ones pictured. I have a set of the one's pictured and they are great. Not so sure how the replacements will perform.
2,super cheap,"These are made of cheap, soft metal. About as low quality a steel utensil as you will ever find. But they are big and reasonably shiny so I'll give up 2 stars."
4,Weber Q Stainless Steel Tool Set,"The tools looked durable enough to last for generations. Design of the tong, however, was not good, the meat slides when you use it. The solution I made was to bend the ends of the tong a little bit with smooth edge pliers. After doing this the tong worked perfectly. I would have rated the tools 5 star if not for this particular flaw."
3,I's OK,"I expected a Yoga routine, something I could do daily. The description of the CD wasn't complete. Do you know one of his that would give the complete sun salutation?"
3,if you like No Doubt you will dig this,"A german band, (all english speaking) with the lead singer (Spanish and female) Sylvia is the main attraction of the band. Don't get me wrong, just having her on the album cover is worth the money. She is quite hot, and her voice is quite exotic as well. Makes the music sound better than it really is. Bubblegum punk, who would have thought...Someday they will be big in the US, lets just hope a calendar of Sylvia comes out first."
5,Elijah with Sir Thomas Allen,"I confess to being a bit of an Elijah aficionado - having 5+ recordings of the work and having sung it many times myself gives me a position for comparison. That being said, I rank the Philips recording with Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields with Sir Thomas Allen singing Elijah at the top of the list! The recording is flawless, the varied soloists outstanding (although Janet Baker's solos on the older recording with Fischer-Diskau singing Elijah is still the standard for contraltos!) The choral ensemble has commendable intonation and diction - and for the most part, they use the ""original"" English version, not one with some of the archichisms extirpated! I found Sir Marriner's interpretation invigorating.If a single recording is what you want for your choral library, this one is superb! My first introduction to Sir Thomas Allen was through his recording of Songs My Father Taught Me - his wonderful high range fits the Elijah role perfectly."
5,Great Story loved it,"I love Amy's books, they always have alpha men, strong heroines, an excellent plot with a lot of action. Just my style. A real page turner, I could not put it down."
1,Worse than Useless,"Here is a book that manages to offer nothing new to the ideas set out in Vogler's ""The Writer's Journey,"" while claiming to be both work- and life-changing. It takes more than a slew of poorly-drawn diagrams to understand story structure, and it takes more than ""one side of the circle is the hero having a problem, and the other is him solving the problem"" to get to the heart of conflict and character change. But that's all you get here.Stick with Vogler. His version of mythic structure may be limited and in need of revision, but it's infinitely more useful than this pap."
1,Not Worth Your Time,"I've read more than a dozen books on screenwriting and this was the only one I found to be a waste of time.The author comes off as if his concept is some kind of cosmic answer, a saviour to the screenwriters of the world. No hyperbole here, he preaches a kind of new-age religion. His ""Golden"" idea simply amounts to a rearrangement of all the screenwriting principles already out there. Don't waste your money."
4,The purple dye on the glue stick is an excellent idea.,"The purple dye on the glue stick is an excellent idea. You can see the part that is already glued and the part that you still need to apply glue on. It works like a lipstick, if there is no more glue, you just twist the bottom and up comes more.This glue is not as strong as the other glues, even on paper. Not as smooth and easy to apply as some others. Texture seems to feel grainy, it sort of crumbles - but not the kind that make a mess. The color vanishes after a few minutes, it dries transparent just like an Elmer's glue which opaque white at first and then turns clear when it dries. The top is an easy twist-off not the snap off which is a good thing. This way it is more sealed and not likely to dry up.The size is perfect for small projects and crafts. Very easy to store, you can just throw it in the drawer and forget about it. Available in different tube sizes.I'll give it 5 stars but it is not a very strong glue."
1,Belongs In The Trash!,"I had this toy and it wasn't fun.The bratz babyz dolls kept falling out of the chairs.This is the dumbest toy ever.I returned this dumb thing and got my money back.Any bratz fan wouldn't buy this toy.It is frustrating,difficult,and a complete wast of time and money.I wouldn't recomend this toy for a 6 year old.They could easily get mad when it doesn't work.I wouldn't waste my time on a stupid toy that doesn't even work!I wanted to give this toy 0 stars but unfortunately the lowest rate was 1.I hope you other kids and parents take my advice and don't buy this toy and waste your time and monet."
3,"Could have been better, could have been worse","I heard 'Fried out broken girl' on the radio a few weeks ago and decided to check this out. The music is well-produced, but as the other reviews point out, the lyrics are too far to the left. Also, I think Matthews should have taken the Bryan Ferry route instead of trying the more up-tempo stuff. It sort of bugs when a song starts with raucous guitars and you get a whispery vocal.The album should have been a mellow-out, all-slow thing. The music soars and slumbers, but his voice doesn't adjust. He's definitely better suited for the night-tracks. And another thing, Mr. Matthews--less is more. I think 'fried out' got some airplay because its lyrics, vocals, and arrangements are the best combination of Matthews's talents.All that being said, I have to admit I love '3 cornered moon'. That and 'fried' are the way he should go."
2,The music is semi-intriguing; the lyrics are mad.,"Matthews' album is dark and brooding. It's quite depressing in tone. The music is interesting, as music, but its listenability deteriorates rapidly. The album is self-consciously done. The liner notes would like to have you believe that this is the first ""quality"" pop music to come out in years. It's all rather pompous. Nevertheless, I will keep this in my collection as a kind of curio."
2,"good ideas, poor execution...","I bought this album shortly after it came out, admired its intentions (and some passing phrases) but never warmed to it. After a recent move, I brought it out again and played it, and my suspicions are now confirmed. Matthews is a very fragile talent indeed, and for all of his venturesome interest in a sort of pop/classical fusion (I don't mean that as a putdown in itself) he doesn't really have it in him to pull off the synthesis he imagines. Fortunately, Sean O'Hagan came along to do it right with the magnificent High Llamas."
3,Vacuous and rather dull...,"I Love the Llamas and Apples in Stereo, so I Really wanted to love this. I Don't. Most of the songs feature 4 note chords with typical 6th or 7th note highs, unimaginitive phrasing, and just never seem to come together as a whole. Some parts are very beautiful musically, and others just drift in and out from other better written music which this may ocasionally remind you of. The recurring lounge theme in previous reviews is apt. There really is not ONE of these songs that stays with you and makes you want to hear more. It is a Shame, because there is so much unrealized talent within. Technological Perfection, Vacuous Content."
5,a must have,"if you own a tom tom you really must have this case. it holds all your accesseries for tom tom. i already had a cover but this is so much more. i'm really glad i got it. now when we go out of town we can take all the supplies...the cables, cords, extra maps, and pack the dash holder and tom tom when leave the car to prevent theft. it's really great."
2,TomTom case,I didn't realize the weight and size of the deluxe carrying case when I ordered it. I was trying for light weight portability which it was not.
4,Tom Tom Go Deluxe Carrying Case,"Nice case. It has enough space for all the parts except it only has a separate compartment for the TOMTOM, one elastic space for one item (I use that for the car charger), a small space for the speaker cord to connect it to your audio system and another small cord and another small space. There is no place to secure the mount, electrical plug and the mount for connecting at home. So when you open the case, make sure it's on a flat place."
4,Great for ESL or for teens and up learning Spanish,"I used this for several years in my Adult ESL classes - the words, and matching up the numbers are a little cumbersome for any age younger than junior high, I think. The only drawback is the lack of phonetic spelling - I think we expect it from a dictionary, but most picture dictionaries leave that part out for some reason.This is not a good book for young children - too many things to look at on one page...EXCELLENT resource for adults and teens, though, who are eager to increase vocabulary and are confident with pronunciation. I use it a lot in my Spanish classes, and even as a reference, when wanting to boost the vocabulary list for the week.For the younger child, try Flip Flop Spanish, which comes with a CD."
3,is good to learn english,La verdad me parece que este libro esta mas dirigido para personas que quieren aprender ingles. Yo lo compre pensando que podria ensenarle espanol a mi esposo.
1,Keep looking,"This was a much smaller resource than I thought, and the text font is miniscule. I returned the product for the Oxford Picture Dictionary by Adelson-Goldstein & Shapiro, which is quite good."
4,Very Good resource for learning English as a Second Language,"This picture dictionary is an excellent resource for learning English as a Second Language for native Spanish speakers. The only reason I didn't give it five (5) stars is because I would like the print to be a little bit bigger, but even as it is, it is still readable."
3,"Not NEARLY as funny as ""Grown little man""","...but funny never-the-less. I bought it also just because. I want to support Kevin Hart, as I feel he's real and legit. Sure he's making millions and I'm not, but that's because he provides a much better service than I can, so that's just that...I'll buy each subsequent DVD he comes out with, to include #thinklikeaman, until he does something (like Katt Williams - just fell off the grid) that makes me choose to no longer support his career.Still a funny movie, and a must have addition to your other comedies."
2,Same old stuff,"On this DVD all Kevin did is rehash old stuff from his last two DVD. No new routine, or people. To tell the truth it was boring"
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this dvd as it turns out my husband couldn't wait for it to arrive and rented it. I have several of Kevin Hart's DVD to include Seriously Funny and I couldn't stop laughing the entire time. So I really expected Laugh at my Pain to be just as good if not better.This time HE JUST WASN'T FUNNY. It started off with a documentary on his upbringing, the actual comedy show was not that long and after the comedy show it went into a short skit/movie with Kevin Hart and some other characters. ALSO NOT FUNNY. I fell asleep. There were some funny moments in the stand up portion of the dvd but not that many. Don't get me wrong I love Kevin Hart but I wasn't feeling this one, I plan on returning this dvd and getting something else."
1,seals the deal,This dvd that millions of people spent their money on was NOT FUNNY AT ALL..... Kevin hart has fell off or this is just a miss..but I never that he was funny in the first place...i guess we have to say it was good cause it was kevin hart...people dont want to keep hearing about your kids and repeating the same check joke about 6 times.. it ended terrible and the skits were bad as well.. once the money comes some people lose their focus
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I rented this movie from Redbox for exactly $1.28. I wish I would have used that money to buy a bar of chocolate candy instead. I love Kevin Hart, however this movie was horrible. I only laughed maybe 45 seconds throughout his entire performance and movie. Don't waste your money on this movie. The only people that may find this movie somewhat entertaining are teenagers. If you are over 21 then you may not enjoy this boring movie. His jokes were so dry to me. I fell asleep watching this because it was sooo boring! Don't waste your money."
1,Good Quality DVD - Horrible Stand Up,"My boyfriend and I purchased Kevin Hart's most recent stand up to add to our collection. We completely loved his last stand up and are quoting it all the time at the most random times; however, we were not impressed with ""Laugh At My Pain"". It could be our fault because we've hyped up his stand up to the extreme and this new one definitely disappointed us. We could see the similarities to his original stand up (the best one), but the deliverance was off. It wasn't funny - and he was trying to be funny, but failed. It's now collecting dust in our home. We're hoping to get some money out of it by selling it online - or maybe just donating it to our local Goodwill store.All in all - the quality of the DVD was excellent. And the shipping was lightening fast. We've never had problems when we've purchased items through Amazon. It's just unfortunate this particular purchase was a waste of our money and a waste of 90 minutes of our precious time."
3,Laugh at my pain,Laugh at my pain was ok. I did not think it was very funny. Needed other comics to make this video work. Not as funny has his latest movie
2,Not as Funny as I had hoped,I ordered this along with his Seriously Funny DVD. I did not laugh that often with Laugh at My Pain. I think if you want to buy a Kevin Hart DVD then Seriously Funny would be the better choice. Was disappointed with Laugh at my Pain.
2,Subpar,"Decent show, but nothing that really made me lose control laugh. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but it's not the worst thing out there."
3,Not as funny.....,"Really not as funny as his other shows.It is entertaining...and he is my new favoritecommedian, but I love his other shows!rhonda moret"
1,He does work hard but...I am still disappointed,"This wasn't funny and I am a big Hart fan. I didn't get a chance to see it in the movies (now I am glad I didn't), so I was anxiously waiting for this. A lot of the material was very personal and I felt how painful it had been at one time so it's hard to see the humor in it. I get that we must be able to laugh in order not to cry, I have definitely seen my part of life's woes, and can look at them differently as time passes, but it's nothing I want to laugh about. The other material was just not funny at all. I mean the alright, alright, alright was catchy and all...I will say that unlike a lot of celebrities out there, Hart does seem to keep it 100% whenever possible and seems like a genuinely cool person, and based off that I would give him 4 or 5 stars. But unfortunately this review is for the movie, and that to me is a 1."
1,Not funny!,Maybe I didn't see the same comedy routine as everyone else but I didn't find this funny at all. I laughed maybe 3 times in a 90 minute routine. Not good....
3,Weak,"Entertaining but it's been done before. Feeds on stereotypical getting images without enhancement. There are the original masters of this; Eddie Murphy and such, find some new material."
5,Really Kev Really?,This show debuted on Comedy Central today and I'm not sure why if the dvd release date is only two days away?!
3,Not as funny as expected,I enjoyed it and laughed but some of his past stand up acts have been better. I would still view it again.
3,"Decent, some of his others are better...","It was a decent show, wasn't his funniest performance to date, but that's just my opinion. I probably would have liked it more if it was free with Amazon Prime. I don't feel like I got my purchase amount worth of entertainment for it, as I only laughed a couple times. As I said, most of his other performances are a lot funnier."
5,Friggin' H-I-L-A-R-I-O-U-S!!!!,"I teard up a few times....KH is just too funny. You'll enjoy this....period. I watch it often...never get tired of it. ""You gonna learn today""! LOL"
5,Too Funny,This movie/ performance had my laughing from the beginning . I completely love Kevin Hart and anything he is in is a joy to watch .
3,It' okay,"After having enjoyed a few of Kevin Hart's shows, this was ok. It was not his usual ""I can't stop laughing!"" funny. But it was interesting to get a glimpse of his life before fame. And to see his two ADORABLE children."
1,"Bulky, uncomfortable unrealistic","I purchased this product for use in a film shoot involving vampires. Obviously, this was a low budget production and I couldn't afford expensive realistic looking teeth. Based on the price and the photograph (above) these teeth looked like the next best alternative....Sadly, I was mistaken. Not only do these teeth not fit properly in one's mouth, but they are not even pointy, which is to say, they look like dentures that give you an overbite. The teeth you can buy from a vending machine for $1.00 look better than these.If you're looking for a realistic look, then stay away from these ones. If you don't really care, then go for the $0.99 teeth. They're much more worth it. These teeth bite...in a bad way."
4,"Trying real hard not to say ""out-of-this-world""","I liked the insights it gave on how the foods used in the various series were prepared. And some of the recipes sound quite tasty. But the real names are probably for Trekkers only. For the uninitiated, perhaps you should use the English equivalent."
4,Thanks Neelix for your inspiration!,Looking for a fun date night or dining experience? I am a Trekkie and love this book. It is full of fun recipes that can bring life to the party. I would recommend this fun book to anyone looking for a dazzling Star Trek dining experience!
4,Fun book for fans of Star Trek and Voyager in particuliar.,"Fun book for fans of Star Trek and Voyager in particuliar.Good references to Voyager cast and characters. I haven't tried the recipes yet, but I didn't buy the book for the recipes."
1,junk cookbook,this is not worth the paper they put it on .....it is not worth the money i spent on it. and i do not recommend anyone buying it.
4,Qapla!,"The desserts in this book are by far the easiest and best tasting things to make. I especially liked the raktajino cake which has a yummy lemon-butter icing recipe thats to die for. Believe me, I am NOT a good cook, but the dessert recipes are easy to follow. Also, a lot of the drink recipes are available, and while not terribly exciting (Romulan ale is actually blue gatorade) its still fun to get and drink with the other recipes. Some of the main courses are a bit too complicated for a beginner like myself. Other recipes, like Klingon organ pie, are down right gross. Then again I am a mere trekkie not a trekker so you more hardcore fans will eat this stuff up (no pun intended.)"
1,Fail.,"Just look at the table of contents to find out that whoever wrote this did NO research whatsoever. Are Tuvok's recipes vegan? No. Remember how Chakotay did not have to drink the meat nectar that made Harry Kim sick because Chakotay is a vegetarian? Then why aren't Chakotay's recipes vegetarian? Fail, fail, fail."
5,Works fine with Win98SE,"I just got the DS-330 today. In response to Dale's previous post, I had no problem installing the software and driver on a Dell workstation running Win98SE. The OS found the right driver to install, though I can't be sure it used the one on the CD. Made a test recording, transferred the *.dss file from recorder to computer, converted to a *wav file, no problem at all. Haven't tested anything else yet, but it seems seems to work fine. Dale, I can email you with more details but your address is not visible."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH MACINTOSH! (and poor audio quality),"BEWARE! This product does not work with Mac OS X 10.2 or later. The software included with the product will launch okay, but it will NOT recognize any Olympus Digital Voice Recorder that you plug into your Macintosh. Even if you get the updated software off of Olympus' website, it STILL does not work. [...] Basically, if you want to get your digital voice files onto your Mac, you're out of luck with this product. Shame on Olympus for not fully supporting the Mac community. (Plus, the audio quality on this device isn't that stellar either -- I got better quality out of a 10-year old cassette tape recorder.)"
3,Nice design but poor voice quality,"I like the display of the DS330 and it's features are very nice. However, when I compared the recording quality against the Sony ICD-BP150, the difference was like day and night. If you want it just for voice recording, it might work just fine. I wanted good quality recording so that I can record my piano playing. On the DS330, the recorded piano sound hardly sounded like anything but broken music. It also has annoying background noises which becomes very obvious when the volume is turned up. The Sony BP150 also had switches on the back which allows easy control of VOR and playback speed. Whereas on the DS330, you have to go through a set of menu options to make the necessary adjustments."
1,2009- Watch out Mac Users,Watch out Mac users this doesn't work any longer - probably for a long time now. Can't download and device isn't seen by the Mac.Just too old!
2,Hope you are a digital genius!,"This is not a user friendly device. If you use it on a regular basis you may be O.K. I am not a regular user and I need the direction book every time. It has many many features and the learning curve was too much for me. Also, learn to use the lock feature, touching any of the many buttons can mess up your recording. Good Luck."
1,Beware of Olympus Digital Recorders!,Buyer's beware. Olympus support is horrible. If you ever lose or damage your software Olympus will not help you get it. I lost my CD when I moved and you can't download the software anywhere (you can't even buy it from Olympus). Now I have a completely worthless digital recorder. I'LL NEVER BUY OLYMPUS AGAIN.
1,Very poor support: no driver on Internet,"We bought DS330 to record interviews for our radio program. While the recorder workes reasonably well, I've run into big problems trying to copy the data onto PC. I was filling in for our regular technician. I was given the recorder with a cable and craddle and expected it to work with the computer. No such luck. The driver for the recorder control wasn't recognized. I searched the Internet, but the Olympus Web site has only updates that require the original software to be installed. But the original CD was misplaced and I don't have it!I understand Olympus doesn't want to give away an ""advanced"" sound editing software, but why the basic driver is not freely available? I got used to the idea that all the basic drivers for hardware devices can be easily downloaded. Beware! Olympus thinks differently."
4,Additional comment,"With so many reviews already available here, let me avoid going over the same ground. This is a great instrument with one serious annoyance. I use it in taking biological research notes in the field, and for trail notes when hiking and backpacking. The annoyance is having the STOP button immediately below the PLAY button. Despite years of use now, I still manage to press the latter when trying to end a recording. So then what I've been recording is ""rewound"" and I have to mess with fast forward to find the place I left off. This is a serious enough problem for an ""all thumbs"" person such as I that if a new model appears avoiding this problem, I'll buy it and give this one away."
2,Makita is better for less,"sound is OK. went through 3 of these, 2 refurb, 1 new. Ipod input plug went on everyone with in a month or 2. CD broke on every one. radio reception is bad, bad, bad!! here in CT. The Makita radio works better, sounds as good if not better, smaller, lighter... just better, only bad thing with the makita is the power supply and it's not a charger, reason for smaller size I guess.I love most bosch tools.. but this thing is WAY over priced and it's a POS"
5,Read more books like this one.,"I first picked this up at a used book store on the recommendation of the owner. It hit the mark perfectly for my 12 year old. He is not a strong reader, and doesn't take easily to books. He found this one impossible to put down! It is Jack London, at a lower level, and so healthy for young male readers today when so much of what is written is not positive and productive to a young man's mind. Kids should be reading more books like this one."
5,You can raise your quill 5.25 inches,"I had a problem with numbness in my hands that was not solved with padded gloves so I wanted to raise my handlebars to take pressure off my hands. This pyramid stem riser allowed me to keep the quill stem and the handlebar that had come with my bike, but to get the handlebars 5.25 inches higher. But I had to pay a bike shop to replace the 4 cables and housing because the cables did not have enough slack for the 5 extra inches. This worked well on my hybrid and made it more comfortable so I did the same thing on my mountain bike. Both bikes are from the mid 90's and have threaded quills. If you do not know what size you need, then loosen the quill and take it up and out and on it you will see numbers such as 22.2 engraved on it. Then buy the stem riser in the matching size such as 22.2 diameter. The higher handlebar height works well for me and I like that this product allowed me to get a higher height without buying a handlebar in a different shape."
3,Read this before buying!,"Pretty good quill but what you need to remember ( and the mfg. should probably have mentioned it) is that if you have hand brakes and a grip shifter system, the cables will most likely be too short to reach the higher handlebar setup. We had to recable the whole bike. So a 2 minute project turned out being 2 hours. I'm not a bike mechanic. Luckily, I have a friend who is."
3,not your typical card,"These cards are too big, fold a 8.5 x 11 piece of paper in half and there you have the size of these cards. The textured finish is not good for printing photos, get the glossy ones instead. You can get blank cards from other companies at a lower cost."
4,A marvelous interpretation of a difficult work,"Haitink clearly ""gets it."" This work has been recorded poorly by others, but Haitink and the LPO clearly understand that Shostakovich was trying to create something new within the symphonic form. The political climate that surrounded the creation and release work affects how one listens to it, and Hiatink makes sure the dissonance is clear without using it to punish the audience as some Shostakovich interpreters have. The only recording of this work that I prefer is Previn's with the Chicago Symphony (gotta love the CSO horns doing Shostakovich!). Nonetheless, this is a great recording. My only small wish is that Haitink would have added more tension to the remarkable conclusion of this work."
2,Cool Box.. bad dominoes,"The box for this dominoes set is really nice and well made. The dominoes, on the other hand, are poorly made, unsymmetrical, the dots are uneven, and some dominoes are thinner than others. I like the box; hate the dominoes."
1,Not what I expected,I ENJOYED THE BOOK at first then. I FOUND VERY involved with looking up scriptures I like to read for enjoyment as well as education but just couldn't get into this one.
4,Great Christian Companion to Book and Movie!,"I think I liked Ed Strauss'A Hobbit Devotional: Bilbo Baggins and the Biblebetter, but this one was also an excellent read and very enjoyable. Each chapter will take you 5-15 minutes to read (depending on how fast of a reader you are), and includes a bit of ""Hobbit"" story in (naturally) chronological order. After the story part, it goes on to an application, some questions to consider, and five or more Bible passages related to the topic. There are a total of 22 chapters. The questions are amazing (they WILL leave you thinking!). Chapter titles include (among others) ""Plans Go Astray,"" ""Help Un-Looked For,"" ""Stick to the Path,"" ""True Identity,"" and ""Where Your Treasure Is."" The book is full of excellent writing, and I would certainly recommend it for ""Hobbit"" fans of both the movie and the book!**Tyndale sent me this book for free as part of the blog tour that I signed up for. I was not required to review it positively. All opinions are my own.**"
2,Walking with Bilbo,I didn't like Walking with Bilbo because it was like reading King of the Rings which I've seen the movies so I returned it.
1,"Bilbo,",I can never accept how people can take a story like The Hobbit (FANTASY) And make a GOD relationship from it>>>
1,Bilbo is a dissappointment,I did not like this book; to me it was just so much jibberish. Do not waste your time or money on this ite.
4,Really Good book!,"I really like this book, I'm only half way through it, but I like the parralels Sarah makes with Bilbo's adventure, and our adventure as a Christian. It's almost like a devotional with the verses to look up at the end of each chapter :)"
4,Different Type of Reading!,"This book definitely takes a turn away from the traditional depictions of history. Instead of focusing on traditional issues such as politics, religion, or economics, it focuses on the importance of sexual desire in relation to these issues. It is quite interesting and is a refreshing view of Maya history and culture."
1,Better Plan Ahead,"When ordering this book I made note that it was available to ship immediately. When I was sent my confirming e-mail the ship date was not for 3 days after my order date. It didn't actually arrive for 2 weeks after that. Not that big of deal- except that my book club met on the day it arrived! Guess you need to REALLY plan ahead. Still haven't read it, as I'm on to the next club selection..."
5,A Terrific Read!,"John Milton's prose are as lyrical as Enrique Granados's music. If you enjoy this man's music, the book is a must read. This is a book all music lovers will enjoy...and want to give as a gift as well.Jack Goodman"
5,Great condition,"I was happy with this seller. The item came early, and it was very well packaged (to prevent it from breaking). suprised that for 2006 it was in great condition. will buy from the seller again ++++++++++++++"
3,I Miss the Flow...,"Over all the album is just OK. I have a few complaints about it and a few praises.Complaints1.) Ace's voice has either changed or he isn't singing with as much emotion as The Room's Too Cold.2.) Where is the flow!!!? The flow was so great in The Room's Too Cold. It was just amazing.3.) Skippable tracks. There were none in The Room's Too Cold.4.) Recording style. In The Room's Too Cold, TEN used an old vintage recording style with little digital influence. The more you turned up TRTC the better it sounded, this recording style is just like everything else out now, cold and shrill.Praises1.) The MOTHER disc is amazing and flawless. This disc alone is worth the purchase of the record."
3,Dissapointing,"This three CD set is a real departure from earlier TEN stuff. The first CD is great, the second CD is blah, and the third CD is awful."
5,Almost as good,"...as their debut album. This one is a little grittier and has some country and almost cowboy-ish influences befitting the album's title. However, it's a fantastic listen, and songs like Unpainted Arizona, Tone Blooze, Solomon Bites the Worm, and Heard You Were Dead, really grab you in the gut and feature some really dextrous guitarwork from Adam Devlin. Great album."
2,Technical Problems Overshadow an Otherwise Fine Album,"Let me begin by stating that I really wanted to give this CD a better review. Unfortunately, while I give high marks to Murray Gold and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales for some fine performances, this is the most poorly mixed orchestral album I've heard in years. Every track shows evidence of aggressive compression and normalization (to the point where clipping was evident on some sound systems), and the final track is easily the most distorted professional studio recording I've ever heard. Probably good enough for a soundtrack but not nearly up to par for an album. Worth a listen for Doctor Who fans, but it could have been so much better."
5,Great Stuff!,If you like a good classical score than this is for you. The orchestra comes through on this one. Most of the tracks are short so you don't get stuck with a theme that repeats over and over. The liner notes are also interesting to read (not the norm on most releases).This was a good purchase for me and I will pick up some newer Doctor Who sound tracks in the future.
4,But can the sconic screwdriver hold MP3's?,"For Dr. Who fans you are going to get a nice suprize. All the composions are well done especially ""Domesday"" Killer bassline. The theme has been brought back closer to the Tom Baker/Peter Davidson era which is a good thing. But be warned there are two songs which are just bad. They are sung in a very ""middle of the road."" Mr. Gold does some great scores but these songs are something that K9 would have to destory to save the day. Overall, very good soundtrack."
4,Great Soundtrack,"If you're a fan of the incredible music from the New Doctor Who, you'll thoroughly enjoy this CD. Just one word of caution: if you're buying because you're a fan of ""Song for Ten"" (the song from the end of ""The Christmas Invasion"" where the new doctor picks out his wardrobe), be advised: the CD version is NOT the episode version. Even though it did not evoke the same feeling as the original song from the episode, it's still worth picking up... there are some lyrics that didn't make it into the episode that foreshadow events that happen later in Series 2 that fans of the show will find very interesting."
4,Dr Who Music as good as ever!,"This CD has a fabulous selection of tracks from both the first and second seasons of Dr Who. Included is the revamped theme and an extended version. The selection of music is great from fast paced to slow and moving. Overall, a very enjoyable CD. One worth adding to the collection, especially for all those Dr Who fans."
5,Movie Score Quality,"This score is right up there with the best blockbuster movie scores Hollywood produces. Television shows tend to be scored with one theme, played always with the title. The Doctor Who soundtrack is fabulous and exciting new music with different themes for different charactors and adventures that create a moving sound picture. Rose's theme is absolutly not to be missed!"
1,Gospel / Spiritual Harmony Fan,"If you like ""Standing in the Safety Zone,"" don't buy this one. Gone is the warmth and smooth harmony; The biggest dispointment is that you can barely hear the original Fairfield Four, especially with the newer male singer who yells, screams, and growls, which creates more dissonance than group harmony."
2,Diluted Experience,"This CD will be a disappointment for those wanting the Fairfield Four without intrusion from others. I can certainly understand the temptation to be a part or the magic; but I want to hear the guys, not other singers indulging their fantacies."
2,Should have been remastered,"Too bad this cd was not remastered. I have to agree with previous reviews that while this is one of the best interpretation of Mozart's Requiem, the sound is muffled at time."
2,Musically good - Sound poor,"I cannot agree with the other listener's ratings. Whilst interpretation and choir might be good or even outstanding, the sound quality of the recording is poor. The choir sounds like singing from the cellar, the music sticks depressingly to the speakers. The sopranos are ringing in the ears and the strings sound like produced on a synthesizer. This recording is one of the victims of the early digital recording ages. A great disappointment."
3,was 5 stars in 1991. It is 2008. Philips: PLEASE REMASTER THIS GEM !,"I will not add to the existing reviewers' consensus on the sublime performance. It is outrageous this recording has not been remastered to 24-bit/96kh or even to SACD or DVD-A, but is only available in the pathetic CD technology that was state of the art in 1991. This would have made a fine candidate for Philips' 50 great recordings series from a few years ago... Better late than never, please?"
4,Mozart: Requiem,It sounds good. It skips track #2 sometimes on one of my cd players but on an older cd player it plays it. oh well life is tough if this is all I have to complain about <g/>
3,"Good nuggets of advice, but too much advice to buy, buy, buy","This book provided good advice for enhancing my reading, and strategies to find more books I enjoy -- but I chafed at the author's stressing of buy, buy, buy. It seems wrong to build a library of candidate books I may never read or like, but the author assures the reader this is okay. The author also recommends buying copies of well-liked books for friends, and writing in books (ruling out library books). He recommends the library for reference materials and the advice and guidance of librarians, but not to actually borrow books. This appeared very self-serving, as the author's company sells books, bookcases, and book accessories."
5,A way to re-energize your reading,"I liked this little book. In itself it is a quick read, and it reminded me of wonderful times spent immersed in books. When I was 10 years old my dad gave me a journal to write book reviews in. A brilliant idea, and obviously it pre-figures Mr. Leveen's book. Too bad I didn't take up the habit. I would love to read my youthful reviews now, 40 years later.I've purchased the Bookography software (available from Levenger) and am using it to try and make up for lost time, chronicalling past favorites and present projects. I recommend this book highly."
5,"Pleasant, quick, and useful reading","I almost missed the book because negative reviews because I usually trust negative reviews more. I agree that the book is simple, and common sense. But I would argue the author articulated the his ideas very well. He put the opinion in concrete context, and demystified some of my confusion related to reading.He is always in a ""talking to you"" tone, and humble enough to let the readers make their decision. Overall, it is a pleasant, quick reading, and I got something out of it. On the other hand, it is not necessary to buy the book because anybody can remember the common sense suggestions easily. I borrowed it from library."
3,so-so,"The Gina and Duncan characters were well developed and I also liked the adorable Martha and Oliver characters. Unfortunately, the story itself was just mildly entertaining and downright irritating at times. For someone so smart, Gina was just too dumb to be believable when it came to Duncan. Even when she began to suspect him, she still retained this blind trust that he would not manipulate her, which he did and often. Also, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending was a little weak. Elements were added toward the end that seemed contrived and felt like convenient wrap-ups rather than flowing with the rest of the story. All in all though, aside from the HillRat politics which was often more fascinating than the thriller part of the story, a mildy interesting read."
4,"Not His Best, But Still Good","Being a huge Repairman Jack fan, I couldn't resist this one. I like Paul's writing style and this story was pretty true to that. My biggest problem was that it was a bit slow for the buildup and spent a little too much time inside the MC's head. That was a very minor quibble though as I still enjoyed the read.To me this read as a story where Mr. Wilson was just getting his writing chops. Seeing as how he is a medical doctor (I don't know which kind of medical doctor), he is eminently qualified to write this. It reminds me of Michael Crichton, which is not a bad thing. Seeing as how this and the companion book written in the same era are so cheap, I'll have no problem picking the other one up one day and adding it to my reading list. Recommended."
4,a very fun read.,"I loved this book even though the ending was a little far-fetched. By then, I was sucked in and loving it! This is the first F.Paul Wilson I've read and I just ordered four more."
5,Sensational medical thriller,Sensational medical thriller that had me truly squirming with fright and panic as the events unfolded. Builds up nicely and then climaxes with a vengeance. Unputdownable. A must for fans of the genre.
3,Not His Best,"I am a huge fan of Wilson's Repairman Jack books, and I ennjoy reading his other books as well. This book was entetraining but my problem was the bad guy. He was too sympathetic. I found myself wanting him to succeed. You have to have a bad guy that people really hate. Otherwise its just not as interesting. The protagonist was all right but after a while she got to be annoying. I mean the bad guys kills congressmen how can you hate him. This book was written 15 years ago and oddly enough the issue of health insurance in it is very relevant now. If you like Wilson you will enjoy this book."
3,Average,"Within the first 2 chapters, you know Who and What. The only suspense is Why he's doing it, and what he'll do when when he realizes that the heorine is on to his scheme. It's not the best book I read this summer, but was still enjoyable.Plus, I give the author credit for using the work ""kakistocracy"" to refer to the US government. Even if you're not into medical thrillers, you might enjoy this one for it's unflattering depiction of your congresscritters."
1,Very messy,"When I ordered this book it said Good condition. I expected it would have a few creases, dents, but this book is SO DIRTY I just don't want to read it or even touch it! I spent almost four dollars on it plus shipping but I'm going to look at the library and check out the book to read it. This book is going in the garbage."
3,Watercolors - Attractive design; Limited to set purchase,Corelle Watercolors dinnerware is just what I wanted. Corelle is great and Watercolors is a very attractive design. I just wish they sold individual and accent pieces.
5,Festive and Indestructible; great for outdoor entertaining or everyday,"These festive dishes are great for everyday use or casual entertaining. Because they're virtually indestructible, we help the environment by using them instead of paper plates when we dine outdoors on our deck."
4,Love this set!,"I love this style because it looks current...some of the styles look so outdated. I agree with other writers that the bowls are best for pasta and salad. I bought white open stock bowls in various sizes for soup, snacks and cereal. I love Corelle for everyday because they take up a lot less space than stoneware and I don't have to worry as much about my kids breaking or chipping them. My first set of Corelle lasted 20 years. When I purchased this a year ago there were two slightly different sets - one with the pasta bowls and the other with the standard bowls like other Corelle sets - so I bought two sets with the pasta bowls and one with the standard bowls. I agree with other writers that the small plates look dirty--I wish Corelle used white rather than the mottled, dingy beige in the center of the plate."
3,nice set,Good looking set. I like the eclectic design of the different plates. It works well even though it might not seem so because most people are used to all plates being identical.
4,Really cute and colorful,"I love these dishes, they're really colorful and have the durability of Corelle. I heard this pattern was going to be discontinued so I bought two sets right away. They were boxed real good so nothing was broken and delivery was awesome. The only down side to this set is the green, it's more of a mint green and not as brillant as shown in the picture but I like them anyway. I also wish there were deeper bowls to go with the set...like a cereal bowl. Overall I'm very satisfied with them."
5,Love Them!,"We decided to go with Corelle because they are break and chip resistant. Already tested this twice when 2 bowls fell on our ceramic floor. They didn't break!Love how the colors in this set are mixed and match, very whimsical and fun, and vibrant!Pro's: Very thin plates and bowls, love how they load in the dishwasher and don't take up much room in our cupboard. We like the idea of a shallow bowl. This bowl is large so it holds a lot of food!The only con is the mugs. We don't like them and the design doesn't go the whole way around the mug. But we will either live with them or buy the large Corelle mugs in a solid color.We are very happy with these plates!"
3,Looks Great - But,"This is very attractive dinnerware. But, if you are someone who cringes at the sound of chalk on a blackboard, and/or knives being sharpened, don't buy this product. The sound and feel of a fork scraping against the plates is unlike any product I've ever used from Corelle."
4,Corelle Impressions Dishes,"I am satified with the dishes, however there are a couple of pieces with flaws in them. Since they are ever day ware I chose not to bother with any claims. I really like the pattern on the dishes.D. Fox"
5,Corelle Watercolor,So much color but so delicate - truly looks like watercolors. Pop the bowl in the microwave and have oatmeal in 2 minutes! I had a Corelle product years ago but left it behind in the divorce; it had a silver stripe so it couldn't be used in the microwave. This is an especially lovely pattern and it is lightweight and serviceable. I am very pleased with my purchase.
1,Something is wrong with these!,"I got these last year - for a summer cottage. After very little use, they are now splochy. The white centers are full of brown splotches. I think they are defective. Corning is usually a quality product, but there is something wrong with this pattern."
5,Love These Dishes!!,"I have owned this set of Corelle since Christmas 2007, and I just love them. I, too, was a little disappointed in how shallow the bowls are, but they are nice to use as a salad bowl. I recently shopped at a Corning/Corelle outlet store and saw this set. They did not offer any serving pieces, and I am a little sad about this. I contacted Corelle and was told that serving accessories are made based on the popularity of the set. Apparently we need to get more people to purchase this set!! Also, I bought a set of white Corelle bowls that are deeper and rimmed in the exact blue color that is in this set. They match nicely. The really nice thing about this set is that you can purchase accessories in other Corelle sets to coordinate."
5,Beautiful and Functional,"This corelle wear is really pretty, you enjoy setting the table with it. For me it is also functional. My husband has Huntington's disease. One of the few things he can do around the house is load and unload the dishwasher. He was chipping up my good dinner ware and was very unhappy about it. The corelle ware is very light and easy for him to handle and if he does bang them they do not chip."
5,FUN PATTERN-STURDY PRODUCT,"I love this dinnerware! In fact I have purchased the sand Corelle also. The watercolors pattern is playful and appeals to my eclectic nature. I purchased the sand color for more formal dining. My sister has always raved about how much she liked and depended on Corelle and I kept using stoneware. Well not anymore! I am stuck on Corelle now. It is sturdy, light and fits in the dishwasher like the rack was made for it. I also love the space saving stacking. I will never buy any other dinnerware!"
2,Problems with Corelle Impressions,"I have been a user of Corelle for years and wanted another set. I read the reviews regarding the negative issues with this set but thought I would like the colors so much that I could ignore the negatives. If I had not needed the plates when the order arrived, I would have returned it.Pro: I am very pleased with the colors and like the fact that the cups are ceramic, not plastic.Cons: The bowls are USELESS unless used as salad bowls. Be prepared for the blackboard screeching as described by several reviewers. The saucers are especially bad about making this bone-chilling sound when a fork is raked across the surface.Who in the world would have designed bowls to be so shallow or surfaces that create such an unpleasant sound? Seems like someone in Corelle Quality Control or Design Department would have said, ""Wait a minute. This does not meet our standard of excellence."""
3,Pretty but.....,"This set is really pretty but I was surprised by the color of the lunch plate. Most reviews I read complained about the soup bowl but I was kind of surprised by the color of the lunch plate. All the colors are supposed to resemble water colors and most of the design is really nice but the lunch plate is colored brown instead of white, making it appear stained and dirty. It kind of reminds me of tea stains on a white cup. The bowls and plate are white and very nice. I love the coffee cups also. If they change that one tiny design they would have a perfect set..."
2,corelle watercolors,nice dishes as far as corelle versatility. soup bowl is very shallow and salad plate has a finish in center that looks like chocolate that did'nt wash off in the dishwasher. not a coffee drinker so the cups are of little use.
2,Watercolors -- faded,"Corele dinnerware -- Watercolors pattern. I was very disappointed in the colors on the actual dishes. They look bright and cheery in the photo, but in actuality are very dull and faded. You would hardly know the cups are green. I wanted something bright and COLORFUL, and these did not live up to their picture."
3,watercolors dinnerware set,"This was not what I had hoped for. The colors were so bright in the advertisment and they were dull when it came. I bought it as a gift for my daughter-in-law. After spending over a hundred dollars, I did not want to give it to her. Also target had a free shipping, but said they were out, you got it from target, and I could not use my five dollar discount I had gotten from target. Not happy with my purchase."
3,Too much colors and design,"When I saw the picture of this Watercolors dinnerware set, I was attracted to the bright, cheerful and variety of prints per piece. However, to my regret I realized upon receipt of the merchandise, I prefer the simpler print in chinas with more subdued colors. (I am much happier with my more subdued Textured Leaves Corelle that I just bought with the textured leaves pattern that I will buy to make a service of eight plus the coordinating Corelle servewares of the said pattern.)The Watercolor dinner plates are somewhat heavier than the regular Corelle plates and I realized it is because they are almost half an inch bigger than the regular Corelle dinner plates. The pattern around the rim is about one and half inches wide. The Watercolors mugs on the other hand that are of Stoneware in material and are made in China come lighter green in color when in actuality, and they look lovelier in their pastel hues (not too bright)."
2,not very good,"I don't like this much and for Sunny day real estate, this is a terrible let down. I do suggest buying other things from this band, but not this cd."
3,Least Favorite of All Sunny Day Albumns - but great band,Seller was good. I own all Sunny Day Real Estate and Fire Theft albumns. I like this albumn but only a couple of the songs really do much for me. I wouln't say it sucks but I like all of the other albums better. I can't remember but this may have been their first album. They are a kick as band...a rare aritistic exception to most main streem music today.
4,How a sunny day feels,SDRE's second album simply titled 'Lp2' showcases the bands dark indie rock form the most clearly. This album is quite similar to their debut 'Diary' but more focused. I am more fond of 'Diary'. 'Lp2' is full of enjoyable alt rock and is sometimes easier to rock to than the dark debut. 'Friday' is possibly the best track it's short and sweet and rocks. 'Red Elephant' feels like a cold bath with taunting guitar and aching vocals but delivers a positive tone. '5/4' is my favorite song on the album with it's swaying guitar and tender vocals. 'Waffle's agitated progress fires on all cylinders straight to the heart. '8' and 'J'Nuh' are respectively grand in a gentle nerve splitting tempo that elevate the album into greatness.
4,Roundabout....,"I stumbled on SDRE by accident. I went to a Foo Fighters show in 1996 and learned that the rhythm seciton for that band (well, that lineup anyway) used to play for this band called Sunny Day Real Estate. Since I really digged (and still do BTW) the Foos, I started researching, could't find the albums at you standard mall stores and forgot about it. Then I borrowed a copy of the Batman Forever soundtrack from a college buddy, and heard Song 8 by SDRE. I think I put it on repeat like 7 or 8 times. My roommate hated it. That right there proved I had stumbled onto something good. More punk and rock-based than their more recent releases, when they began to share more and more in common (stylistically) with Yes, more than say the Pixies or their other early 90s alt rock contemporaries."
4,A beautiful drafting table!,"This table is sturdy, easily adjustable in both tilt angle and work surface height. I have seen desk/art tables with stronger ""wow"" in trendy stores, but up close, their quality and finish are inferior to the Alvin. I got the larger 31x42 top unfinished. I liked the reddish color of the cherry melamine top, but wanted the slightly coarser, natural wood veneer. A quality cherry finish may help - or not. The jury is still out since you can't undo it...Assembly was really quite easy. I did run into a head-scratcher, thought of a solution, then found it already addressed in the ""Hints"" section. Just got ahead of myself!"
2,Not worth it,"This may be something for the casual photographer, but for someone who needs to use their camera on a regular basis I don't recommend these batteries. First, you need TWO for the Olympus c740...which is roughly $26 at a time. I volunteer for a local football organization that has 3 squads and on game day I take pictures for approximately 6 hours straight. I don't use flash at all, just point and shoot. These batteries lasted for a little over 200 pictures and 9 hours of shooting time before giving out. This means that I would have to replace these batteries for each game day and that is ridiculous. I certainly didn't get over 1000 pics like the previous reviews! I have since purchased 8 of the Monster rechargeable Nihm batteries with the charger and I make it through game day just fine. The total cost was $60 but it will last me all season and more....better value in the long run."
5,They really work,This Non-rechargeable lithium battery pack lasts up to 2.75 times longer than AA lithium batteries and 20 to 30 times longer than AA alkaline batteries. GOOD ITEM GREAT PRICE
5,Lock Grip Pliers,"As with all Irwin products, it is well made, durable, and pricey. But, if you need a quality tool,this is it."
1,Dont waist your money,I have tried these and they don't do any good except filter the bigger stuff like hair and some dust. What I did was go to Home Depot and buy the WEB Electrostatic filters which comes in a big sheet and cut it to size covering the inside of the door opening. These filters the smoke and other odors and saves the inner filters from being replaced so often saving money.
1,Doesn't fit tabletop HAP412,"I don't know why HAP412 is listed for this filter! It is too short and too skinny. And Holmes does NOT list this as OK for HAP412. And they don't list a replacement. I have another Holmes that uses bigger filters that I can cut down, but what a pain."
3,ok,"This filter was a little too small for my air purifier, even though it was supposed to fit it. I managed to make it work, but it took some improvising on my part. Works fine."
1,filter,"wrong product for not tright fller bu wll work for someon that it would flt on their pufier, s returned it"
4,the boys are back,"quite simply,""lay me down"" is a song i've always wanted to hear.it's stuck in my head and has a great message.if you like david and graham you will like this,but i'm telling you,this one song is ""IT""."
2,burggirl,"While this book was informative, it is the type of book that needs pictures with it. There are none for that with the kindle at least."
1,"Well-intentioned, poorly executed","As a long-time student of Celtic studies and an Irish speaker, I had high-hopes when I ordered this book, as it purported to present Colum Cille's life and work from a Spirit-filled Christian perspective. Unfortunately, the research seemed almost non-existent; there were no references, footnotes, endnotes, or bibliography to back up the author's narrative, and the Irish in the book was so faulty that it barely resembled the language. Well-intentioned, yes, but it falls far short of a scholarly work. One would be much better served reading Brian Lacey's translation of Manus O'Donnell's 16th C. work ""The Life of Colum Cille."""
4,BUILDS YOUR FAITH,"Columba, the Celtic Dove isn't a scholarly work but it is definitely one worth reading for every Christian that mourns the fact that the Bible talks about signs, wonders and miracles; however, they are rarely seen in the earth today. When you read the ancient words about Columba turning water into wine, bitter water into sweet and raising a dead child to life, it gives you hope and builds your faith that someday, perhaps very soon, everyday believers can walk in holiness and resurrection power and do the works that Jesus did. The book is short but the tales are ancient. I especially liked the recounts of power encounters with the Druids."
4,Caillou as a good example,"This is a beautifully illustrated book based on the PBS series, ""Caillou"".This book illustrates how Caillou is a ""big boy"" now, able to stay up later than his baby sister, play board games with his parents, and finally go to bed, with his door shut. Thanks to this book, we were finally able to convince our daughter to sleep all night in her own bed. She is proud to say that she is now a ""big girl"", just like Caillou!"
2,Not a great Caillou book,"First of all, this was my 4th Caillou book purchase and my 2 1/2 year old loves the cartoon series so I am a Caillou fan. Despite this,I must say that this book (and another which I just got ""Caillou-Careful""-see that review too)has some examples of unwanted behavior in it that I'd would rather not teach to my son. May be my son is more impressionable than others, but he picked up that Caillou was scared of the dark, didn't want to go to bed and wanted his door open. All this stuff needs addresing if it's an issue in your house, but my son has no fear (yet?) of any of those things. I now edit myself when I read this book to my son because I don't want to teach him that there's a reason to fear bedtime. When he loses interest in it I plan on throwing it out. I almost got the Caillou Potty book but I read a reveiw that said almost the same thing that I just said about this book influencing negative behavior. I would suggest avoiding this book for that reason too."
2,Poorly written book,"I agree with the last review...this book introduces too many negative behaviors for children. Our 2 1/2 year-old daughter has not had a fear of the dark, so we found ourselves editing the story to fit our needs. But aside from that, I've found this book, as with several in the series to be burdensome to read. They introduce too many ideas/lines of text per page, cramming in lots of events that aren't or can't be represented by one picture alone. Also, it just seems these storylines were cranked out without any thought as to cohesiveness and pleasant wording. The Caillou Play Time book actually expresses that Caillou has feelings of hatred toward his parents. Needless to say, it was a bit over-the-top for our tastes."
3,caillou is whiny,"I received a set of 3 Caillou books as a shower gift and my son just LOVES them. I was surprised with how much he likes the books (starting at about 14 months) because each page does have quite a bit of text. I also find the books and the show introducing negative emotions that might not enter a child's mind if it wasn't suggested. It seems as if Caillou and his parents are at odds with each other in the books I've read: Good Night, Careful, and Day Care. In the show, he is often whiny and demanding-not the kind of behavior I want my son modeling. Maybe I'm over-analyzing, after all, it's just a children's book and like I said before, my son can't get enough of Caillou."
4,Response to negative reveiw,"Most parents purchase such books as ""afraid of the dark books"" for their child because their child IS afraid of the dark. These types of books are typically books that parents use as tools to assist their children with growing up issues. To suggest that the book is ""too negative"" because your 2 1/2 year old developed a fear of the dark after the parent exposed their child to the subject is more a result of poor judgement on the part of the parent. Parents need to consider age appropriateness and also use good judgement in selecting books. If you have a child that is not afraid of dogs, then don't purchase a book that is intended to be used as a tool to help those children that may have a fear of dogs. It's all about basic logic. Just because a book is a ""children's book,"" doesn't mean that it is necessarily the best book for your particular child. Use common sense."
1,Where is it???????,"I have yet to receive this product, I assumed there was a delay in shipment, quite a lengthy delay!!! I am sincerely disappointed in the fact that the shipment of my purchase was never completed. In past orders, I experienced no problems of this nature, I've since decided to take my online shopping elsewhere.Sincerely disappointed,Mrs. Pellerin"
1,Bad Taste Personified,"The Hellboy series is so well-done that the Hellboy Junior book comes as a surprise. These stories are witless take-offs on the once-popular Harvey comics for small children - Hot Stuff the tough little devil, Wendy the good little witch, Baby Huey, and so forth. If your idea of humor is to see how outrageous something can be, you may find this book funny; if not, then not, for it lacks humor of any other kind. Personally, I grew tired of depictions of disembowelments and the damned being forced to eat feces."
3,Very Helpful but confusing,"First I have to say the editing job really detracted from my experience of the book. there are words that are missing and words that are wrong in many places, so that was frustrating. Besides that I found the book lucid in many places toward the end, where it begins to get to the real meat and potatoes of NLP Spiral Dynamics and some Integral theory. I felt like i had to wade through a lot of reading to get to some key points and their elucidations, however they are in there."
5,2002 Kia Optima SE V6,Work out great no problems whatsoever double checked with ac delco to make chur it was the right one. 1 Year latter still going strong half the price of napa Great Buy.
3,where's the balance?,"Interesting book, but I'm afraid that many people who read it will be robbed of fair apologetics until they read something from the opposition. For example: Lee Strobel's 'Case for a Creator', or 'what Darwin Didn't Know' by Geoffrey Simmons, M.D. I used to be an atheist, now I don't know. All three of these books present strong cases and convicting elements. I'd reccomend Scott's book only if the reader pursues awareness of the other arguments afterwards. Knowledge, my friend, knowledge."
4,A Non-controversial Introduction To Islam,"The author has written an excellent introduction to Islam. Ms. Robinson discusses Islam's history, structure, and effect on believers' lives in an easily-read, narrative manner. Her book is well-illustrated, and special topic discussions are highlighted.This guide is a non-controversial assemblage of facts. Ms. Robinson does not discuss socioeconomic conditions within the Islamic countries. Her discussion of women's roles within Islam is weak. She alludes without comment to the Muslim's duty to convert non-Muslims to Islam.This non-controversial guide leaves the reader eager for more detailed knowledge of Islam."
5,Comments Worth Reading,"As someone with no ear at all for foreign languages, I find it amazing that these people become writers and then choose to write in what to them is a foreign language. Even more, they write it so much better than the rest of us.They also reflect on how their bi-lingualism makes their English better. It seems that the effort of learning the second language gives them somewhat of a drive to find ways to express themselves in English what might be an easy thing to express in their own tongue. As a result, they learn ways to use English that stretch the language to its limit.To have gotten fifteen writers of the caliber contributing essays to this book has to be considered a major coup on Wendy Lesser's part. This book provides an insight to language that is astounding."
4,"""A blossom of hands""","This book of short essays assembled by Wendy Lesser is well worth the time and attention of anyone who enjoys language and the craft of writing. It provides the insights of serious authors as each adapted to the English language after being first subject to another tongue. As a bonus, the book is worthwhile in that it gives the reader a quick appreciation of the varied writing styles of fifteen talented authors, in case the reader would like to track down and explore any of their other independent works."
5,A survey of how writers alienated from their mother tongue,"Wendy Lesser asked fifteen modern writers to reflect on their formative experiences with language and culture, and her Genius Of Language is the result: a survey of how writers alienated from their mother tongue embraced English and faced exile from both their culture and their own language. Essays by Amy Tan, Louis Begley and others provide important keys to understanding the process of adapting to another language and all its cultural implications."
4,Better than most,"I have had numerous solid rubber white mats and they stain and get black yuck growing on the bottom of them. This one doesn't seem to stain or have yuck growing on it. The white rubber ones wouldn't come clean even in the washing machine. Since this one is kept off the bottom of my sink when not in use (the mat is ever so slightly wider than the flat part of my sink so is elevated a wee bit) the sink is able to dry completely between uses. Overall, I do like this mat. The one thing I do not like is that if nothing relatively heavy is on top of the mat when the sink has water in it, the mat floats. Not a big deal, just kinda irritating. The mat looks good and is functional.....functional is the main thing."
4,Works Well,"It serves its purpose well, providing a padded and slightly elevated surface in the sink. It has remained clear so far (about a month), not soaking up stains. My only complaint is that it is slightly ""warped"" which doesn't really bother me because it is probably because of its thickness, which makes it sturdier. Sturdy means a lot to me."
2,Just ok,"I will keep this item but only to put in the sink while washing dishes. I wanted something to just leave in at all times but this has no center cut out to access the disposal (which is obvious but I didn't even think about it before ordering) and it traps food underneath and that grosses me out. It does, however, protect my new sink while washing pots and pans and that's really all I'm worried about. It's also very thick and not pliable in any way so keep that in mind."
1,Pew!!,"I couldn't get past the smell...a very strong, noxious, chemical smell. The mats sat for several days but the stink lingered, so I packed them back up and sent them back. I bought aInterdesign 60663 Pebblz Sink Matin the past, and had to throw that out as well due to chemical smell that never went away. I had hoped that maybe that was just a rotten batch that was made in China, because even though there were numerous reviews similar to mine about the smell, the more recent reviews included comments that theirs didn't have any smell. I thought I'd give Interdesign one more try. That's the last one, though. They still make a toxic smelling product."
4,a great hockey legend,"This a great review of a very good hockey player. Very interesting,I learned several things about the career of this great player."
4,A Great Book on Gordie Howe!,"This book tells about Gordie Howe, one of the best hockey players ever, and his career in the NHL.In the beginning, it tells about his first couple of seasons, and then tells more about his great career and facts about him toward the end. I learned a lot about him from this book, for example, I learned that he has played for two teams, the Hartford Whalers and the Detroit Red Wings, and that he was considered one of the greatest players of his time."
3,"Starts out great, but ends up only a good book on Howe.","The book starts out covering Howe in excellent detail. Several pages cover his first seasons. Then as if the author lost interest, the decades go flying by. My reasons for reading the book was to find out, why Howe was considered great, how Howe compared to Richard, how the game changed over the years and what it was about Howe that enabled him to play for so long. The book only addressed how Howe established his early greatness."
3,Dry but a good reference,"If you are looking for snappy language and explanations for laypeople, don't buy this book. But if you need a real reference that helps you put together the various communication technologies and explains their differences, here you go. Of the few books on this subject I have read, this is the only one I would recommend."
1,worst ever,"I choose 1 star cause it is the worst book I everread. The author is obvious shallow in this area andhe tries to present a complete view of the networkingand communication, which he fails to do. And severalconcepts are totally wrong in the book and manychapters are simply copy and paste.Don't waste your money to buy this trash."
5,Clear vision needed in today's culture of change,"The more things change the more they stay the same, or so the saying goes. We think that today is a time of significant change and we are forging a new and better future. This insightful collection of essays from 1963 discusses many of the topics that are on the front burner today. It clearly shows where the change promised is heading...and why we do not want to go there."
4,Powerful,"Well done. My hat's off to the editors. It had to be difficult to wade through that much material and decide what stays and what goes. It had to be just as difficult to relive that horrible day through the first-person accounts of friends and colleagues.As for how it reads, it is a FAST read. But for me, I can only read a little at a time. It is a powerful book."
3,Devastation and Depression,"I have read that in combat, soldiers seem to sense that life,death and destruction are prerequisites for battle. The emotional scars stay with them for a lifetime however the concept of battle prepares them to accept what has happened.September 11,2001 will never have any concept of acceptanceto any normal human being. Innocent people, simply doing their jobs, were robbed that dreadful day. For some it was life itself--for others trying to find out and report to the world what was happening- turned into life and death situations.This book is a tribute to these men and women and the peoplewho were responsible for getting the word out to the world. I admire them greatly.My only feeling while reading the book was that some of it was repiticious and I felt switching back and forth from New Yorkto Washington was a bit confusing at times.The book is a sad commentary on our real New Millenium."
3,Not bad,"Don't bother if your'e looking for pictures. Alot of self herroism, however, I still think it's a must read."
5,I love this game,This game is great! It is best with 6-8 people although I have played with 15 and it gets a little crazy.
5,Fun Fun Fun,"Fun for a family of four or more, and for a couples get together. I only read about this game in Amazon, and I kinda liked what I read, but believe me it is Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun. We started playing it, and it doesn't take much to learn. I love to win some of the rounds in this game, but I have to admit the fights with the judges are fun too. This never failed to amaze me. We played it over a dozen of time now, and we only had it since Christmas. Every game has it's moments. If you like party games this one is for you. If you like arguments this one is also for you. If you like to make jokes this one is for you too. Man you should see what some of these cards say!!! :)"
4,GREAT FAMILY GAME,We first played with 12 people...lots of fun.The second time with only 4 people it was not as much fun..the more people the more fun.
3,Fun game for parties,"I like Apples to Apples, it's a good game to have at parties. It doesn't require a lot of thought, people can come in and out of the game, the hands are quick."
5,A Great addition to any Family Game Night,This was a real fun game. Easy to learn for the whole family. We even had our five year old intereseted and playing along. The best thing about this game is the arbitrary nature of how the winning card is chosen. It can be completly random. Some of the cards laid down for a given question can be really wacky making for a fun and entertaining experience for young and old alike. We litteraly had ages ranging from 5 to 76 playing one night and everyone was laughing and having fun. The crate edition is made of very strudy wood which should ensure the game will be kept in good shape longer than in a cardboard box. The game is worth every penney...
5,Great game for entire family and friends,"We had played this game at Thanksgiving with about 8 of us around a big round table. Others on the sidelines were enjoying it as much. Ages ranged from 9-55 at the time. The kids had so much fun they begged for the game as a Christmas present. Since then, we have played it with couples and had equally good time. Partly a game of chance as to which cards you are dealt, it also brings out a good humor and creativity. The educational value came to the younger players who needed definitions of the descriptive word cards before they could play a round. All in all, a great game!"
2,Cute-but not what was expected.,"This video is cute but not at all what I expected. I was drawn to the information on grooming a sheltie but the whole video focused on puppies, not adult dogs. Adult dogs have very different needs than puppies do. My dogs did enjoy the doggie video towards the end."
1,Don't bother!!!,"Could have been a nice product but failed at every turn. It was 2 months late in arriving, received 2 copies instead of the requested one and was an absolute waste of time as it was advertised. The only info provided was obvious to any dog owne and the dog was a poor representative of the breed. Didn't use any variety of the breed. The viewer gets the feeling that the production takes place at a shelter and the human rep in the film is calling out for different breeds to make the same lousy film with yet a different animal. ""OK, that's a wrap - now let's do the beagle.""Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Hardly an adventure movie,"This mvoie is based on the true story of the murder of a young woman. The murder rocked Newcastle and if I remember correctly, some parents of one of the children involved tried to have it baned. Yes it is harsh and confronting, more so because it is true and shows human nature at its worst. Not a movie to watch if you need cheering up."
2,Between a rock and a hard place,"This film is based on the real life sadistic rape and torture of a school girl Leigh Leigh, in the Newcastle region of New South Wales.What I found remarkably hard to understand about this (perhaps it's just me) is the 'dilemma' faced by one of the lead characters.He and his mates are out having a party. He witnesses the rape and the killing and yet he has a 'dilemma' about reporting it because he's good mates with the perpertrator. For me there's no issue whatsoever, the brutality of the crime could not be convered up, so I had enormous difficulty understanding the motives of the central character of this film"
3,black rock the movie.,"I thaught that the movie was aleright besides the fact that ""heath leadger"" is in the movie and ""Aaron carter"" i dont like anyone of them. The best part of the movie is when Ricko jumps he should of done that at the start of the movie that way the poor girl would still be alive. Jared is one confustd little boy but he opens up in the end. the movie is about a girl that gets raped and murded there was one witness and he is not saying anything.he is asked about her and he still protects his friend{ricko}. i dont think that its right to protect some one when there is a murder involved."
1,Don't buy this product,I bought a SanDisk Sansa M240 1GB MP3. I used it by one week and after that it didn't work any more. I don't recommed this product.
3,It works!,I bought this player for my son for Christmas. I ended up buying a Creative Zen nano plus 1 g player for like half the price that was way better than this player. I kept the Sandisk and gave him the Nano plus. Anyway I get this player and it did not work right out of the package. I called the tech support and they ended up formatting the player and tried to install the updated software from the site; but it did not work; so they ended up installing the regular operating system on it. It works fine now; but forget the updated software. It's a cool player but I like my sons Creative Nano plus much better! It has many software programs to edit and organize your music with. This is not needed because I do everything with windows media player. I like the menu on the Nano plus much better! get the Nano and you will get more bang for the buck!
1,Buy this and test Your Bad Karma.,"I used this for couple of months and I have tested couple of other MP3 players also. First I thought this is the best MP3 player because it has no moving parts in it (microdrives, etc..), very light and tuff.But there is fatal BUG in this player that can occur any time (depending on your luck).If file transfer disturb in middle, it creates 0 bite read only file(s) and you won't be able to delete those. This can happen easily if USB disconnected, loose contact while you transferring files. Once that happen the player keep on looping around start up message (initializing message) and you have to throw it away without any hardware faults in it.Search the net (keyword: `initializing problem sansa'), you will find lot of unfortunate people like me with dead player.This is defiantly a good player, if there is no such a fatal bug in it. Sandisk must recall this product.Do not buy Sansa."
1,Very dissapointed,Bought two of these for my niece and nephew for X-Mas. One froze up and would not initialize after the 1st day. The second did the same in about 2 weeks. Amazon is the only bright side to this story. They quickly replaced the 1st and am awaiting the second. I should just ask for my money back. Would not recommend!
4,Great player for the money,Great player. Easy to use and compact. Only complaint is that it takes a little thought to organize your music into playlists. It has worked well with music downloaded from www.burnlounge.com/burnloungemusic
3,Disappointed,"I bought this for my grandson's birthday and it was a hit. But, three weeks after he received it, it just stopped working. The company we bought the player from is accepting the return and crediting me for the defective unit, but needless to say I have a very disappointed grandson. We are replacing the player with a different brand."
3,A Bit Touchy,"Physically, the device itself is fine. The headphones are adequate, if not stellar, and the armband, while kind of cheap, gets the job done. The menus are pretty basic, and with good sound, the m240 is pretty decent overall. However, software problems are an issue. The device comes with an advertisement for three free Audible audiobook downloads, but when I tried to upload them to the device, problems started. Most of the time, AudibleManager wouldn't recognize the m240, but when it finally did, it wouldn't upload the files. I tried to upgrade the firmware, only to find the device refused to turn on. I called SanDisk, and they said that this was a known problem and that I needed to go back to the store to exchange it!In short: if you can get it running, it seems to be pretty okay, but it's awfully touchy if you try to get fancy with it."
5,Great alternative to the IPod,"Great first time MP3 for my two kids, ages 9 and 11. Didn't want to invest $200 on something they may or may not use, may lose, or otherwise destroy. Bought our first one in December 2005. Bought our second one in Jaunary 2006.The SanDisk MP3 is very user friendly, easy to download music to and easy to navigate - especially for MP3 newbies. Good sound quality, long battery life, easy-to-read display (shows song playing, battery life remaining, number of songs on player, and more) all add up to a great little MP3 player."
4,LISTENING TO BOOKS,"I use this player for listening to audio books while exercising. In general it works well for this purpose. There is good battery life (18 hrs. with one AAA); conveniently small in size; easy to use controls; and a clear sound. 1 GB is plenty big and will store several books at a time. There are a few negatives that SanDisc needs to address. When the player is turned off, it is supposed to restart at the same point when turned back on. In reality it jumps ahead about 30 seconds, forcing a rewind. SanDisc support was unable to correct this problem on my player. Also, the view screen is slow to scroll and needs to be sped up. In summary, given it's positives and very reasonable cost, I would recommend it to audio book customers."
3,It's a good starter MP3,"We ordered this for my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. I nearly lost my mind trying to get my computer to recognize the thing, and then found out from a friend that I needed Windows Media Player version 10. I had version 9. So after downloading that, all went well. I am a little disappointed in the quality, because after only a few days, the text line at the bottom of the display is already gone, so you can't see whatever is written there. She swears she did not drop it or get it wet. It plays music, though, and downloading music to is is easy, once you know how."
4,for the most part...great,"I first got this to use when I workout. Now I use it all the time. The radio is pretty good reception and it's easy to download songs. The only complaint I have is the armband is uncomfortable, it pinches a little."
4,Awesome,"What a great mp3. Its cute, holds lots of music and easy to use. We did upgrade the headphones, though. The ones that come with it weren't all that great."
5,Great player for the price,This product is easy to use and functions well. The capacity is great and it is a great quality for the price.
4,how to create a playlist?,"Just got mine yesterday and quite happy with it. The only thing still hasn't worked is the playlist. The manual said Press + Hold the Select button while the song is playing to add/remove the song to playlist, but nothing happened after I did that. Any suggestion? Beside that everything is great."
3,Very bad sound quality,"I owned several MP3 players: iRiver, Creative, iPod, and this SanDisk Sansa. I used good headphones (Sennheiser and Sony) to test these mp3 players' sound quality.This player's sound quality is the worst. Bad sound.Updated: this player is really bulky and ugly. It's not user friendly. And the user manual is a joke.Updated: How can I downgrade the rating of this piece of junk to 2-star or 1-star? For this price, you can buy the Creative Nano Plus, which is much much better than this piece of trash. Well, it's an insult to compare Creative Nano Plus with this Sansa M240, a piece of junk."
2,No Way!,"My freind has one of these and he was all happy and excited when he bought it. And he couldnt wait to open the box... well he sooner or later got the player out and went to his laptop and connected it and started putting songs on it..well 2 minutes later the screen goes black and he cant do nothing with it so his only option was to take it back to Circuit City,and then i drove him to Circuit City and he returned his player and got himself a nicer one with nicer features which is the iPod Nano.. i got a little tempted and bought one myself...and let me tell you...the iPod Nano is excellent!!!"
1,I have a damage item,I received it struck of the opposite part (Display) and as I strayed the original packing I could not return it. Did not mean but is a mess.
1,Don't go the cheap route...,I have bought two of these and both quit working after a few weeks. I bought this because of the good reviews and the price. I will do what I thought about doing in the first place and spend the extra money to get an ipod.
5,"Quite durable, amazing for such a cheap player.","Very durable, I have been very surprised by its performance. Well worth the price. Case that comes with it is flimsy, I recommend the silicone case--it's also very durable. Holds more music than my more expensive player."
2,worked great until it went haywire,"I loved this little MP3 player, until the software decided to go haywire. I called customer support, and they had me go through a bunch of steps to wipe it clean. It then worked again for a little while before going haywire again. I can still use it to listen to the radio, but when I listen to the MP3 tracks, it will often freeze and so I have to take out the battery, put it back in again, and then find the songs I was listening to. Not worth the hassle."
2,For Music Lovers,"You can't fit it in your pocket. It's kind of fat. The screen is not very good. It only has one gig on it so that probobly wouldn't be enough for someone who loves music. Bottom line:if you will most likely be listening to it a lot, don't get it."
3,Good price but...,"The manual that comes w/this mp3, is horrible.I had this mp3 for about a year, and I still can't figure out how to erase the music from the player. Very annoying. Also, there is no title of the album or the name of the song, can't figure out that part as well.Very confusing."
1,Bad buy,I bought this SanDisk for my son for Christmas and it broke the fist day. I returned it and got another one. The same thing happened. So then I returned it a second time and it quit working again. Junk. Do not buy it. Now it is too late for me to return it so I am out money. Bad investment.
2,Not suitable for recordings other than albums,"This player is weird. I use an mp3 player mostly to listen to podcasts that I download. This player is really bad for that kind of thing. It doesn't know how to organize anything other than regular albums, so my podcasts end up buried in endless sub-menus. It automatically titles most of them ""unknown,"" so it's impossible to find anything. I also really hate it that you can't delete tracks from the player itself, you can only do it when it's hooked up to your computer. But the sound quality is pretty good and it's really light - but don't get it for podcasts or any other kind of sound recordings other than traditional albums."
2,Battery-Price,For the price I don't have much complaint but the battery only lasts one week. The sound is not too clear.
3,Entry Level MP3 Player,"The SanDisk Sansa M240 1GB MP3 Player is a basic MP3 player that is good for a first time buyer. 1 GB is more than enough for people who don't have an extensive library of songs or who do not download music on a regular basis. It's compact size makes it easy to put in one's pocket. The sound quality is good despite the fact that the headphones which accompany it are uncomfortable and do not remain in the ear.The booklet of directions which accompanies it is difficult for a first time user to fathom. The instructions given are confusing and it takes many tries to understand the download process. It is also not easy to navigate the various menus. The arm band which is a part of the overall package is uncomfortable. Having a way to attach a lanyard to be worn around the neck would be a nice additionOverall, this is a good basic entry level MP3 Player."
1,Horrible Horrible Shipping!!!!,"I can't even comment on the item because I have NOT received it, but what I can tell you is that the shipping speed is TERRIBLE! I've been tracking it online and it takes AT LEAST two weeks to get here-through an incredibly roundabout way!!! It should be free shipping at this speed-if it ever get here."
2,Too complicated for me.,"This is my third SanDisk mp3 player. I still do not understand how to use it. I have asked for help from the company before, but the language barrier did not help. You must know what you are doing before you purchase one of these. I do not like the earbuds and so purchased my own headphones. I also purchased an FM transmitter from SanDisk that doesnt work at all. This should be for people that already know how these devices work. I am i computer programmer and it was too hard for me!Thanks"
2,SanDisk Sansa m240 1 GB MP3 Player,Never sent in a box that product was supposed to come in -sent loose with only plastic covering and no paperwork-therefore I do not know how to set up or use product!
4,Buen producto,"El producto es bueno, sólo que a veces se queda ""colgado"", y no responde al botón de apagado y necesariamente hay que extraer la pila para que pueda apagarse."
4,SanDisk Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player,"I've been very happy with this purchase. I use it for Classical music I've transferred from CD's so I can listen while working in the yard or walking or whatever. I am amazed at the amount of music that a 1 GB player can store. I have no complaints about the sound quality.It took me some time to learn how to navigate around to select what I want to listen to, but can now do it.The FM radio has very good reception."
4,Good MP3 player,"This works perfectly for my time I spend in my gym. My biggest problem with the unit is the Fast Forward and Rewind speeds. They are AWFUL! But other than that, this unit is wonderful."
3,Good for the price,"pros - good price, very compact, good soundcons - minimal instructions in paper form; must use CD to access manual; instructions confusing; USB hookup to load music worked on one of my Dell computers but not the other;"
1,Great during month that it lasted,Bought it on sale at Thanksgiving and it stopped working New Year's Eve. Enjoyed it while it lasted but now junk.
4,Great MP3 Player!,"I have had my MP3 player for five months now. I love it! It is very easy to use, and I like how I can see the artist, CD name, and song title on it. If it has been paused too long, it turns itself off, saving my battery. It holds a lot of songs, too.I like how I can choose to listen to all the songs or only to one artist/CD.Problems:My player pauses by itself. I will have it sitting on a desk attached to speakers and, without touching it, it pauses. I don't know if it is pre-set to do that after a certain length of time. It is kind of annoying, but I only have to push play, and it continues playing.Overall, this is a great MP3 player for anyone who does not wish to pay a bunch of money."
2,'Tis a Mystery,"I bought this in February and it's a mystery how my podcasts get to this player... it seems to require a different procedure each time. Sometimes I have to make several attempts synching before the new set of podcasts ""take"" and I can replay them. New batteries and the installation of newer firmware hasn't helped. When it plays, it's great. I also dock it on SDAMX speakers. Really nice. What my PC tells me is on the device and what the device seems to think are usually two very different things."
4,Cheap MP3 with decent sound.,"I bought this to keep in my car so I didn't have to transfer my ipod all around. Works well. Easy enough to navigate the menu. Sound is good. Battery life is decent as well. Wish it was OS X compatible but it's an older MP3 player so I didn't expect it to be. The ear buds it comes with are actually sound pretty good which I was surprised to learn. It's a good MP3 player for those who don't need a whole lot of music or those who wish to have a smaller, cheaper MP3 player to carry around."
4,good product,"i've had this player for little over a year now and i love itthe battery life is absolutely great, and i recommend buying rechargeable batteries (but make sure you get good ones e.g. 1000mAh).pros: interface is easy to use, battery life is exceptional, small form factor, can be used as portable flash drive, has non proprietary connector(mini USB), drag and drop files onto device when used as flash drive, customizable EQ, decent shuffle function, FM radio(which i never use), recorder(which again i never use but i've heard works well)cons: shuffle sometimes repeats songs to soon, slow scrolling speed when browsing music, low output volume(only an issue when hooked up to my car stereo), to use play list from say winamp take a little doingotherwise great product"
5,review of the SanDisk Sansa M240 MP3 player,"I purchased this MP3 player for my 7-year old and I was worried that it would be too complicated for him to use....His older brother downloads the songs for him, but he is able to work it all by himself...The digital readout is easy to read and the buttons are also easy to use. It holds quite a number of songs and is great for someone just starting out. The compact size is nice for putting in your pocket. My son just loves it."
5,MP3 Player,This was purchased as a BD gift for 9 year old granddaughter. It was a big hit. Perfect condition and arrived on time.
4,Stylish - Sometimes won't power up,"I like the Sansa for it's ease of downloading music, but it's playback features leave something to be desired. Sometimes the system won't power up and I must open the battery compartment and take the battery out and put the same battery back in to reset it. It also does not play with my car aux jack. I don't know if this is a problem with the device or my car manufacturer."
2,Worked for a day,"The MP3 player worked for about a day and then just stopped. We tried replacing the battery and that didn't work. It would turn on, but would do nothing else. We even had to take the battery out to get it to shut off. I have returned it for a replacement. Hope the new one is better."
4,"A good, but small mp3 player","I have lots of music so the size isn't for me, only holding around 200 songs on here. The thing is small though, and has so far served me very good. It doses have it's problems though, one of the most annoying is sometimes when you delete a song, it says its deleted, but stays on there. I haven't heard any other people say that is a problem, or look for that matter."
4,Un-ending tunes,"I loaded this using windows media player, so I didn't need special software to convert files. The 1GB size is great for all the music I listen to without having a lot of songs repeating. Plus, if I want to listen to the local radio, is all in the one little box. The desplay is great showing song titles, artist, and song length with amount of battery life. I've use it with headphones and in at my desk through speakers and back and forth over the last month for three to four times a week, and have yet to replace the battery.My only complaint is that it can be hard to turn on at times. You have to hold the power button just right at times to get it to power up."
1,Stopped working after 2 days,The sad truth is SanDisk released a batch of faulty M series mp3 players near Christmas time when the demand is the biggest. You can read about problems with this unit on multiple forum. I happened to buy one of those for my niece. For some reason this thing stopped working after 2 days of use. It would get stuck on the initial Sansa screen and nothing could be done to reset it. Windows XP did not see it so it was impossible to change firmware. Thanks God SanDisk has a decent tech support so after a few emails I ended up sending the player back to them (at their expense)for even exchange. Let's see how the replacement is going to perform...
5,Seems to be a decent unit,"Purchased thru Amazon and arrived ina reasonable period of time. Will agree withthe comments that file management is frustrating and the internal software should allow you to better manage. but it can be worked with. Will say theirn internet-based customer service is pretty good.With XP and WMP 10 - need to have USB setting on MTC.We'll see on durability - but certainly it's a lot for the bucks, and probably as good as any non Ipod unit. Unit is thicken tan looks in photos, but no big deal, still light. I liked the replacable battery - don't have to worry about carrying a charger, and battery life seems pretty good."
5,Best Bang for The Buck,"From the moment of purchase till today I am very pleased with this unit.I didn't even have to load the driver provided.It was just plug and play....Loaded 256 songs in Wma format!Battery life is unreal.The only thing I don't like are the earphones....Sound reproduction is good,But I never liked that style of headphone;shoving something inside your ear...So,I replaced them with a standard headphone set. Don't guide yourself by the name of the product.It's a Winner at a great price...."
3,2 player,i bought two of these players...the first one stopped working for no reason and i returned it because i bought a warenty and now the second one stopped working 6 months later. so i would not recomend that you buy it.the player is great but it dosnt last
4,good for a few months,"I rated this item in January 4 stars for its good aspects. Now I would edit my star rating to 1.5 stars. I brought this in December as a Christmas gift for my daughter, who is 11. It is easy to use, small so it fits in her jeans pocket, but it is NOT reliable by any means. It worked great for January and February, but then froze (like many other people's Sansas from reading the reviews). I did contact SanDisk directly, who walked me through some trouble-shooting, which also did not work. They sent out a new one, after giving me a free shipping label to send back the frozen Sansa, and I received the new Sansa with a differnt version of software on it yesterday (March 21). I had to contact SanDisk again because the player would not accept any subscription songs, but they walked through that solution, and thus far it is working. Buyer beware - check the version you receive/buy as some seem good while others not so good."
5,"Forget the IPOD, get the SANSA!","1st of all, Sandisk is the #2 selling mp3 brand right now, so that should speak something of their quality. As far as the M240 is concerned, it's just about perfect in my opinion. It's completely plug n play, and the learning curve is near to none. I got this as a gift, un wrapped it, plugged it in, and away I went, no instruction book needed. The built in EQ's are nice, especially the custom EQ setting, that adds a nice touch. Playlist's are easy to configure as well. The display is nice and bright, and very easy to read. I like that it comes with everything that you'll need; a protective case, USB cable, earphones, and a wrist strap. If your looking at a cost effective mp3 player, please give the Sansa a look at!"
1,Not easy to use. Not easy to see. Feels like a trinket you'd find in a McDonald's Happy Meal.,"The FM radio worked and sounded okay. My Audible files did not. I have bought many digital products online over the past 10 or so years, and this is the first product that was SO bad that I returned it. In other words, I am generally not picky about my electronics purchases. But the Sandisk did not meet even my low expectations. I much prefer the low-end Creative products."
1,Don't buy this mp3!,"This mp3 player has been nothing but trouble within hours out of the box. First, the screen became perma-'frozen up' within about 2 hours of getting it up and running. Second, it is less than cooperative when it comes to turning off OR on. Third, it will not sync up to my computer when i connect the USB cable to my computer. Maybe I bought yet another 'lemon', but I would certainly not ever buy this product ever again. On the upside, it comes with a lot of neat add-ons like an arm band, a cute protective cover and the sound & volume quality was pretty good...for the very short amount of time i was able to listen to the FM stations."
1,Waste of money!!,What a joke!!! I got my wife one of these for Christmas and had NOTHING but problems. We hardly ever got it to work right and ended up throwing it away and buyinh an iPod (no problems whatsoever with the iPod).
5,A MUST HAVE,THIS IS A GREAT LITTLE MP3 PLAYER AND A MUST HAVE.Its simple to use and a great buy for the $$$$$$. Don't pass this one up
3,Not pleased,I was not happy with this item. It was not what I expected at all. It takes a very long time to add music. It was a waste :(
1,Not worth even small price,"While it looked good and played good for the first day, this SanDisk Sansa M420 stopped working the second day. Efforts to remedy the situation with SanDisk were a waste of time - even they suggested returning it to Amazon. Amazon responded with a credit instead of a new player. We purchased a Creative Zen player as a replacement."
1,very disappointed-multiple problems,"I bought two of these one for myself one for my daughter. This was for christmas, three weeks ago.one has frozen on opening page, the other is constantly needing to be 'synchronized' at every download. I have alot of time on my hands and spent a total of 8 hours getting one to work. That was 3 days ago and am aagin unable to listen, download, etc.tech support is slow at best- out-sourced tech support is as difficult and time consuming as web support.I am so let down becasue for a few fabulous moments I had some great tunes, unfortunately I have spent more time trying tio make it work that enjoying it. For 60 bucks I have spent about a dollar an hour for this piece of scrap."
2,Not recommended,This is my 2nd time at purchasing the SanDisk Sansa M240 and for the second time now it has stopped working within a week. Freezing at the first screen.
5,SanDisk mp3 player,"This is my first mp3 player. Bought it in October 2005 and I love it! My main purpose for buying one is for gym workouts and running. Very easy to load songs. I use it about 3-5 hours per week at the gym.There are probably mp3 players with fancier features, but this little gadget does exactly what I want it to do. The FM tuner is good too. Very good value!"
3,Good mp3 player,"Previously i owned a free napster mp3, it was faster, even on my older computer... I believe this mp3 player is good.. as long as you have a high speed usb port... Mine is not.. So I'm somewhat disappointed."
4,nice little ditty!,"This MP3 player is great for the size. The earphone jack is tight and secure, the player is easy to use and the software is simple, you'll be loading up lots of great music in no time. I would give it 5 stars, but I had a little trouble with my software cd snagging up (like it may have had a scratch or something) Otherwise...perfect :)"
4,works great!,"All is fine and easy, i only need to see why loading a cd, shows as multiple cd's when playing back.I'd like to load different songs to a folder and load that to play back as a one click deal also.Easy to use and takes a beating as i work in construction."
1,Really Has Problems,Have two of these........freeze up and problems with both. Sound is good when it works. I would not buy it if i had it to do over again.
1,Died the 2nd day,"My children received these for Christmas, and the second day of use found one of them dead to the world. Upon checking online, there is evidently no way to try resetting without access to the menu, which of course cannot be accessed because unit stays on the startup screen forever. A big disappointment."
3,"Perfectly good MP3 player, but one important warning!","I agree with all the positive reviews written here, but one thing I really wish I had known before I bought it: most of my music is in MPEG-4 files, not MP3s or WMAs. Probably should have thought, but I have used an Apple iPod before and had no problem playing all of my music. I'm sure there's a way to convert the files to the right format, but to be honest, I probably would have saved myself the trouble (and money) and gone with another type of player. Works fine for MP3s, though!"
3,Software,The MP3 player itself is fine but it does not come with any instructions and the SanDisk website does not help either.
2,Too Fragile,I've had two of these now. I thought I just was too careless with the first but was careful with the second. They function fine but I use them everyday with the wrist strap and after a few months they fail at the input jack for the earphones. Be sure to use an L jack and not a straight one which breaks the input really fast. Mnky
1,mp3 player review,not very impressed by this product...got songs onto the player but within 5 minutes of putting them on they slowly start disappearing from the player.
2,Just buy an Ipod!,"I bought 3 of these for my 3 kids last Christmas. I had to send 2 back after they died or froze within a few days and then the replacements proceeded to go bad also! The third mysteriously still works. I think it's because it gets much less use. It IS easy to read and use - when it wants to. The 2 defective ones got stuck on the first screen and the music couldn't be accessed, much less played. I returned them again and just bought Ipods on Ebay! I would say this is a good choice if you like to gamble with your money:)"
4,"Durable, decent quality","I bought this for my 7 year old last year and it's still holding up. We just bought him a new ipod only because he wants to be able to see all of the song names & choose what he listens to instead of clicking through them all (like changing channels on tv vs. looking at the guide). It's held up through being dropped, lost, taken to school, etc and the battery doesn't get used up too quickly."
4,Good product when it works!,"I purchased 3 of these units as gifts. 2 of them work great and we are very happy with the features and performance. 1 of the units worked for a day and froze up. We called the company and after a lengthy wait were given some suggestions to try, which did not work. Once we had a case# communication became quicker and easier with Sandisk, and they are going to exchange the faulty one for a new one with no additional cost. They are very nice players, but reliability can be an issue."
2,Sansa M240 1 GB MP3 Player,"My son only had this product a week when it started to malfunction. It would turn on, but never play any music. The one thing that was nice, is that the company paid to ship it back and give us another one."
5,sansa 240,"This is a great MP3 player for the money. The sound is amazing for such a tiny device, and loading songs is easy and quick. I have nearly all my favorite songs on my player with room to spare. I like mine so well, I bought one for my husband for Christmas, and he loves his player,too."
1,Sandisk,"2nd time using one of these, bought it for my daughter, it lasted for about 3 hours then froze up. No more Sandisk MP3 players for me."
1,junk - JUST STOPS WORKING!,This thing is a piece of junk and should not be purchased. We bought three of these and they all mysteriously stopped working. Check out the reviews on the internet and DO NOT BUY!
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this player for my daughter for Christmas and less than 24 hours out of the box it locked up and won't play a thing. Judging by the many other reviews with the exact same story, there are a lot of disappointed kids this Christmas thanks to SanDisk."
5,Great Flash Player,"I bought this after trying a Creative Zen Nano Plus that was DOA. The Sansa is great! It plays my podcasts without issue, the battery life so far has been great, and transfering files is a breeze."
4,I would definately recommend this!,"I think this MP3 player is a great buy for the money, the sound is great and the price is right. I was going to buy the I-Pod but it was a little out of my price range, this is a quarter of the cost and works excellently. I wish I could fit more songs on it, but that doesn't take away from the quality."
5,Good Sound,"Great sound, battery lasts forever. Manual is anemic as far as use of directories (folders), and what you can and can't do. If I weren't an ex computer teacher I'd be lost."
4,I love it,"I used to brag that my entire 250+ CD collection fit into my 20 iRiver H10 that was about the size of a pack of cigarettes. Now I'm bragging that all my subscription music can be played on something the size of a cigarette lighter. Battery life is so far beyond my greatest expectation I cancelled my order for a rechargeable battery pack.I have about 500 songs stored on it. I leave about 100 Megs free just in case I want to transfer data from one spot to another.One little tick though, it does get hung up when dragging and dropping more than 300 Megs at a time. So several drops and might be needed.Synching with Win Media Player is a cinch. No problems uploading songs or playlists."
5,A GREAT MP3 PLAYER,"I'm 14 and my Sansa is my first MP3 Player. I've had it for about three weeks and it has every thing I wanted in a MP3 Player.*Pros: You can choose to listen to your music by artist, genre, album, and all your songs in alphabetical order. I also like that you can scroll through all your songs instead of having to skip through all of them (it is a great time saver). Once you understand how to load songs on to your Sansa it is really easy and does not take much time at all. I really like the ear buds it comes with, they are long enough so you can easily put your Sansa in your pocket.*Cons: Like I said, I've only had my Sansa for three weeks and so far there are no problems."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"It is NOT worth the saved money. If you do buy it, make sure you get it straight from Amazon, as they have a decent return policy. Because you WILL be returning it. I got mine from Office Depot (thru Amazon) and they do not let you return technology after 14 days......at least not without a major battle (two days of fighting to return a $50 product is not worth the effort). My player initially seemed to work, but quickly had the same problems that all these other people listed. DO NOT BUY THIS."
1,Product doesn't work; customer service poor,"The product did not work well from the first day. Customer service was of little or no help, and did not provide an RSA on a clearly defective product during a period when it was under warranty.In my opinion, anyone who purchases this item should be prepared to receive a potentially defective product without any of the promised support."
1,What a piece of junk!,"Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Worked for less than 30 days. Locked up and will not connect to any PC. Online customer service blamed the PC's and not their product. PC's work fine for other players, (not this brand). Don't waste your money, there are just as good players out there for the same or better prices. Still trying to get customer service to acknowledge I wish to return this. No response as yet."
4,Great MP3 for the price!,"This MP3 player is my 13-year-old's first one. I asked her to help with this review. I chose this particular one for her due to the price and the features. Here is what she has to say about it...The earbuds are comfortable. I use mine without the covers. They were too hard to put on. Really good battery life. The sound quality is excellent. Adding songs is super easy. I especially like the size. It is smaller than most iPods, but still has the menu. The armband is kind of a pain to put on, but I don't really use it anyway. The way it lights up is nice. I can look at the display in the dark. This would be great for teenagers and adults. I am 13 and I love it! My mom is thinking of buying one for herself, too."
5,It wins out over so many others.,"There is a feature here to counter the awfully slow fast forward/rewind. While the track is playing, if you power it down, (turn it off) it will resume at the same place upon start-up. I listen to only spoken word, 1- 1.5 hours at a time, and the fast forward is terribly slow, but if you remember to do this, there isn't anything else that bugs me about this player. It is loud enough to be heard over my machines at work, (other players didn't live up to this) and the firmware is much like other flash type players, most of the time you'll hear what you load first, depending on the arithmetic title you load. Folders are tricky on this one. Load time is a bit longer than some, screen's OK. The plastic pouch is helpful to keep water from it, battery time is better than most players at loud volume. This is probably the very best player on the market for the money."
1,Poor for OverDrive Audio Books,"I purchased this to use with my local library's OverDrive Audio Books. So far, this device doesn't work with the long .wma files. For instance, if you listen to 50 minutes of an hour long track, you are unable to restart correctly at the 50 minute mark (using the pause button... also, there is not a ""bookmark"" option on this device). I'm giving it away and plan on buying a better audio device.I don't use it for music... it's probably just fine for that type of usage.I'm in dialog with the SanDisk support team. (Updating the FirmWare, making sure the settings are correct for proper ""resume"" after pausing, etc.) If I get a real solution to this problem, I will change my review... but, for now, I would not recommend this device to anyone wanting to listen to audio books."
4,works for me,"it has the FM tuner for the tv's at the gym. it has plenty of space for me to have enough tunes to get thru several workouts without repeating. mine came with the sport armband and for $57 with zero shipping, it was much more attractive than the iPod. there are features other mp3 players have that might be neat but not for an additional $200.my only ""complaint"" if you could call it that is the question of how to remove songs from the player once they're on there.. after reading thru some of the other reviews here, i think i've got some ideas on what to do.but i got what i paid for and am pleased with what i got. flash drive, 1GB, small mp3 player with FM tuner and sport armband for less than $60."
3,Sandisk M240,"I had one before, that one supported Thai fonts and the sound quality from earphone was quite OK. After buying this one, I found that it could not support Thai fonts and the earphone sound quality was not acceptable for me."
4,Good Value MP3 Player,"We have had this player for only one month but we have had no problems. It has worked as designed and is easy to load and change songs using Windows Media player. Soud quality is good and size, although not the smallest player, is very reasonable. We would buy this again if we needed another MP3 player"
4,Scored points again,"I bought two of these for two of the grandchildren at Christmas. Wasn't long and they were in use. Great time, great gift."
2,i hate it.,"I got this mp3 player for christmas and at first it was great!7 months later-- ABSOULUTELY HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!you can't delete songs from it. thats what makes me <u>so</u> mad.it is 1GB, so it should hold roughly 250 songs-- yea well it doesnt do that eithernext, the battery life is horrible. it has a battery picture thing to show how much more battery life you have. when the battery is half way shaded in, the backlight doesnt even turn on anymore. thats also annoying because i listen to music at night in bed, but i cant even see the screen. sometimes it just shuts down too.it sounds like i'm exaggerating, but I'M NOT. this mp3 player is flat out terrible and a waste of money. don't buy it. if you do you'll regret it."
4,Um bom custo benefício,Estou no Brasil.Só compro na Amazon e sempre deu tudo certo.A entrega é imediata e sem burocracia.O produto é bom e atende às minhas necessidades.
1,A Terrible MP3 Player - Don't Buy One!!!,"I just received my second M240 as a replacement for the first one, which was defective. If I was lucky, I could get it to play -- only to have the volume control automatically turn the volume down after 3-4 seconds of play (almost like playing a CD in preview mode). I was SURE this was the one-in-a-million unit that was defective and didn't hesitate to call for a replacement (which Amazon replaced in two days). I was pleased with the player until I discovered that the ""Select"" button wouldn't bring up the playlist or add to favorites - which renders the player useless, in my opinion. So - my experience with the M240 has not been good at all.I liked the look and feel of the unit as well as the way it fit in my shirt pocket, virtually weightless. I'm really disappointed in SanDisk and will not buy their products again. I will advise others to avoid buying this unit as well. It is an inferior/defective product -- don't buy one!!"
2,Randomly turns itself off for no reason,"I really thought this was a bargain and I would love the device if it would just stay powered on! I only had mine for a month before it started randomly turning off by itself for no reason at all. I use rechargable batteries and the cause is not because the batteries are dead. The cause is also not because I accidently hit the power off switch, because you must hold down the power switch for 5 seconds in order for it to shut off. Additionally my device has not been mistreated.It's a piece of garbage, if you buy it just make sure you hold onto your receipt in case you need to return this junk."
1,SanDisk is worse than 1 star,"I sent original back and I got a new one from SanDisk. The first one got stuck in the off position, never to come back on. 2nd one never played the next track automatically. Kept having to advance manually. When you call and try to tell them that their equipment both hardware and firmware are a disaster (cheap Ch...Sh..) they want to walk you thru certain procedures which aren't so. I demanded our money back to no avail. I wouldn't ever recommend the San Disk MP3 to anyone."
1,seriously defective,"I purchased 2 of these as Christmas gifts - one for my daughter, one for my granddaughter. Granddaughter's stopped functioning within days. Luckily we were able to return and get replacement which still works as far as I know. Now the daughter's is doing the same thing - just stopped working. What a waste of time & money. The performance was nice while it lasted, but we didn't even get 90 days out of the longer lasting one. Do not even consider purchase of this product."
3,MP3 Player,"I bought this as a gift, I liked it so well I bought one for myself. Lightweight and easy to use, works for me."
4,Great first MP3 player,I love this little guy! The only downside is that I can't load my audio books from CD to it and have them play in order. For that I needed an Ipod. For just music and Audible downloads it's GREAT!
2,MP3 Player,"I gave this a 3 because my boyfriend and I have been trying to get it to work for 1 month and can't seem to transfer songs. I purchased this product because it allowed subscription service and was 1 GB, but we can't get anything to work. I'm hoping it is my Yahoo account, but my iRiver works just fine. Next time I'll just buy the iRiver because I know it will work."
3,ok item,i got this item for my mom for christmas to hold off until i could purchase a better one she likes it but hates that you need to use batteries which means in the long run she will spend more on batteries then i spent on the item LOL
1,Item recalled by SanDisk,I found out after I bought this item from [...] that it was recalled due to general malfunction. Screen freezes after several minutes of use. Nevertheless Factory Depot still sells them like someone mentioned in their review earlier secondhand.
1,I bought new TheFactoryDepot sent second-hand.,I can only say I will not buy any things from The factory Depot. That is very interesting. Thank you for your service.
4,Backlight won't work for long with rechargeable batteries,"I've had the Sansa m240 for about six months. It plays my recorded podcasts well and battery life seems much longer than with the Creative Nano it replaced. One annoyance: I use rechargeable AAA batteries (1.2v), not alkaline AAA batteries (1.5v). I seems that the lower voltage rechargeables prevent the backlight on the display from working except when they are fully charged. Also, it feels kind of cheap in hand..but still worth the $20 I paid."
2,Bought two One broke immediately,These are flimsy. I guess they are ok if your very gentle with them. NOT FOR KIDS. If your buying for a kid I would suggest a shaker.
4,Firmware upgrades,"Overall, I like it very much. However, my first one locked up after about 3 weeks. No problem with a no receipt swap at Staples. However, looking on Sandisk site today, noticed firmware updates for it. Very easy to do. You can download a firmware installer onto your comuter, and then everytime you plug the player into the computer, if internet connected, it will search for latest firmware. Two had been issued since I got mine at Christmas. It quickly installed the latest on my player. Hopefully, this firmware corrects the lockup problem. I noticed better sound and separation also I believe. It said that installing the firmware would delete the songs presently loaded, so back them up. However, it didn't. I'm glad to see Sandisk actively supporting their products, even the less expensive ones."
1,Freezes Up and need to free up 8Mb for data base,"Looks like I got a bad 1 too. Too bad, because when it worked it was a great compact MP3 player. I've researched the internet and am trying the firmware update, but its been just shy of 2 hours now and nothing is happening except the update seems to be frozen. So I'll be returning it and buying an ipod."
1,freeze,we bought this for our daughter and gave it her for christmas. it froze the day after christmas and refused to work ever again. we returned this to amazon and decided to buy the creative zen 1 GB nano. i wasn't about to risk spending money on another sansa and having it break after any amount of time again. i am extremely pleased with the creative zen and encourage anyone to purchase this item instead of the san disk mp3 player!!!
1,SanDisk...at risk!!!,"Bought this unit for my son who has Autism and needs a simple, easy to synch., easy to operate unit. Opened on Christmas Day, loaded the software, synched with WMP, loaded battery and then...pfffft. Nothing. Went to San Disk's web-site and registered a service issue. No reply at all. Obtained RMA from Amazon and returned for refund.Should have stayed with either Creative, iriver or RCA. Ended up buying an RCA 1GB Sport at Amazon as a replacement. Beware of the sansa."
1,Frustrating,"I bought two of these, and had two fail. Just like others it freezes on the startup screen, and it isnt easy to explain to kids why it doesnt work and they have to wait for a new one. Would have been nice if they came with a reset button, because Sandisk support was unable to fix these. So I have no choice but to send them back and try another MP3 player. Not exactly how you want a christmas gift to work for someone. But I will give Amazon high ratings for taking care of the issue, which makes buying from them a major plus! Personally, they should remove it from sale though until the problem is diagnosed and a fix is found."
1,"Junk! SanDisk, you should be ashamed!","I bought this as a Christmas present for my daughter, big mistake. I really thought that I could trust the sandisk brand, after all they have been making flash memory for some time, anyways, the player worked fine for 14days or so, then it started to freeze. It would try to play a song that was not even there. I sent mine back to Amazon today and requested a refund of money. I do not want to even mess with getting another item from SanDisk. After reading other reviews, it seems that a replacement is just another headache waiting to happen. My daughter is disappointed, she wanted an ipod, but I went the cheap route and bought this thing. You get what you pay for so get something else or you will be writing a negative review too. You have been warned!"
1,junk,I had a 512 mg sansa player that worked wonderfully. but after 2 years of almost daily use playing audio books it wore out. This 240 is a poor excuse for a replacement. It does not have the book friendly features of the 512.
2,wouldn't recommend,"Although the sound is OK, it's not easy to use. There is no way to back up to a previous song, only forward. The plastic case is hard to take off, and it's pretty big so it doesn't fit in the key pocket of running shorts. The price is right if you can handle the size & inconvenience of this thing."
1,Cheap stuff,"Bad product. Period.Ok, it has a radio tuner.But what good is it if you cannot download files on it after a few months?!Even while it was functionning, it was hard to use because the navigation system is sooooo lousy. You have to be very patient to select a tune you'd like to listen at the moment. At the end, I just let it play whatever it wanted to play.Now, it's dead.If you buy cheap, expect cheaper.And then, buy again."
5,Very Good quality Machine,"I bought this one because of the low price, However the quality is awesomewe are talking about a Sandisk you know' the name brand is a very hi quality one. Yes buy this unit it will impress you. it has a 7 band EQ that really works great and also sound awesome with better headphones rather than the earbuds. when buying the headphones try Panasonic,Sony these 2 brands offer very good sound at affordability, but make sure you get a pair with 40 mm drivers,100db or more and frequency response of 20 or less to 25,000 khz or higher. this makes all the difference in the world."
2,"OK mp3.....if you can, buy something better","This was a good mp3. small, easy to use (Even for my 5 year old little brother). but we had it for about 3 months when it started to break down. we would constantly have to change the batteries, and sometimes it would just not work for one reason or another. We finally got rid of it and bought something better. Overall it was an OK mp3, but I would recommend something else."
2,Hard to read the display,Works fairly well. The display is very disappointing and hard to read if you are over 45.
4,Nice for the price.,"I purchased this a few weeks ago but only recently had time to use it. It is simple to operate. I printed out the directions for a guideline which I like to do since I am a ""direction reader"". The quality of the sound is good in both the Music and the FM Radio. I have not used the Voice Recorder as yet so cannot comment on that. The only negative I have is that 1 Gig is not a whole lot of space....but....rather than get a more expensive unit, I opted for this one."
5,Cannot beat it for the price!,"I have had mine for about 3 years and am thinking of buying another just for the asthetics (I use it while doing yardwork and it looks bad but works great!). My wife got it on sale for $30 and I have had no issues with durability (see yard work comment above). It is far far easier to manage than my daughters Ipod, just hook it to usb and drag and drop. I definitely reccomend this player unless you demand Bose quality which comes with the Bose price attached!"
3,Music,I wanted a radio and an MP3 player and didn't want to spend alot of money. I'll probably upgrade some day but this one works just fine for my needs which are listening to the radio on the bus ride to work and my workout music in the gym. The playlists didn't come out the way I thought I programed them - could have been my fault - it's the first time I did it. I bought a different headset for it. It uses one AAA battery which I like. I don't have to worry about recharging a battery. I keep some AAA in my bag so I never have to worry about not being able to listen to music. I have about 140 songs on it and it has room for more.
1,Broke after 2 weeks,"I am not very pleased with this product because it quit working after two weeks. Then to add insult to injury when I contacted Amazon about replacing it they said that the company which I purchased it from no longer had any to replace it with. I will look forward to seeing how Amazon deals with my return. Will they replace it with a new one, or will they give me a full refund?"
2,Don't buy it,There a lot of issues with the last firmware for this player.1. Slow skip forward/backward2. MP3 tags doesn't work
4,It's a good player for the $$$ - Freeze issue is not what most think it is,"It is a good player and the FM radio is a nice touch. The player is easy to use and I really have no complaints.The ""FREEZE"" issue is this: If the battery gets low, the unit tends to shut itself off when you try to power up and it freezes - or looks forzen. What you do is just let it sit overnight and the power runs down all the way. Then you can recharge and all is well.Is this annoying? YES - but keeping the player charged stops that anyway."
2,Really Dissapointed!,"I liked the interface on the SanDisk M240 and the sound was good.What made this a show-stopper was the fact that it did not come with software to move my MP3 unto the device. They relied on Microsoft Media Player. Even though this software was counter-intuitive for me, I figured out how to just pick the files I wanted and put it on the device. Media Player want's to make everything ""automatic"" such as searching all your drives so it is hard for someone like me who just wants to pull a single file and put it on my MP3 player.This, however, was something I could live with.What killed the deal was that more often than not, I would get errors in trying to sync or messages such as ""cannot change sync options at this time"".Finally, I hand enough and went back to a MUVO 100 which served me well until I decide to wash it in the washing machine."
2,Cant recommend this item...,"I wouldnt recommend this item. I bought my first one about a month ago at a retail store, and within 2 weeks it wasnt working properly. The music was playing back strangely ""garbled"", and the backlight stopped working. So i returned it and ordered another thru Amazon. I've had it about (can you guess?!) two weeks, and last night the backlight went out and today when i used it the verbiage and Menu list show up twice on the screen, but split in half. It's a shame, because otherwise this is a pretty cool little device w/ great sound quality. I'm hoping i'm still within the time limit for returns...."
5,Great player for a great price,"I just bought this player because of black friday and i just can't stop raving about this little miracle. This has 1 gig of memory, it can be used as an external drive, it has an FM tuner, and it can record music, + it has an LCD screen. Something with all those features is awesome and it costs under 100$. Also just playing music is easy, just connect, open the folder ,and drop ur music files, it's really that easy. This is an awesome bargain compared with the iriver or shuffle, so this really is a nice player for a great price"
1,Disappointing,"I bought this product because I wanted to read books downloaded from the public library. Unfortunately the downloaded books played back erratically, skipping and without control to navigate within sections. These are legal downloads and the Sansa was on a list of devices that are supposed to be certified for use with Microsoft protected downloads. I called Sansa and they kept me occupied with various ""fixes"" until I exhausted the possibilities - and myself - at which time a supervisor told me that this was a known problem, and basically that its my tough luck. SanDisk has mislead me both in their advertising and in their after-purchase support. I would recommend to a prospective buyer that you move on to another manufacturer."
5,"Nice player, awesome price","Hubby & I wanted MP3 players for our trips & work. After pricing IPods (ouch!) we looked online for other MP3 players out there. This one caught our eyes immediately. I trust the SanDisk name and for this price we figured we'd try it. We were NOT disappointed!! This is an excellent little player! A lot of features (which surprised me because of the cost) and very clear playback. Plus, the ear buds provide a lot of volume which is wonderful for our commute on the subway and for hubby working in the airport. Very satisfied with this MP3 player, would definitely recommend it!"
4,Kids love it.,I bought this for my 13 year old. He loves it! It took about a week for him to figure everything out. It is easy to use once you read the instructions.
2,I had 2 of them die after 5 month,My step son's unit died after 1-2 months. I thought it was just a 12-yr old not taking care of sensitive electronics. But mine just died 2 days ago after 5 months of use. I've never dropped the unit and always carried it in a protective case.
3,SanDisk Sansa M240 Does The Job,"Purchased this little mp3 player for my son and it does the job. Great sound fidelity at a great price. My only minor complaint is the organization protocol. It just lists the songs by title, no folders, etc. I recommend this product."
2,One ear speaker did not work,"My granddaughter is tickled to death with her Sansa M240 even though the left ear speaker does not work. We have decided to stop by Radio Shack for a replacement. No more money than is involved, this is much easier than trying to get a warrenty replacement."
5,"A fine MP3 Player, Reasonably priced","I've had my SanDisk Sansa for close to a year now, and it hasn't let me down yet. It is easy to use, sounds great, and runs for many hours on a single AAA battery. At first, I was worried about the apparently flimsiness of the buttons, but they've worked well and show no signs of wear or trouble. The radio works great and tends to get better reception than my car radio. The audio recorder is little more than functional -- it saves your recordings as low-quality, mono WAV files. This is fine for recording reminders or even basic conversations if you needed some sort of record, but don't count on them for making podcasts or video voiceovers. Nevertheless, it is a solid audio player, and I've been pleased enough with mine to purchase two more as gifts for Christmas this year."
3,mp3 player,This product is great if you have a highspeed computer with the highspeed usb. You need to get additional usb equiptment to download songs onto it if your computer is older.
4,One of the best MP3 player with a reasonable price,"Pros: I bought this Sansa MP3 player on the black Friday of 2007. After using for more than a month, I am pretty much satisfied with the product.The sound quality is very good. The ""Play Music"" option has sub-options. You can select option to play by genre, song, playlist, or album...I didn't expect these so convenient functionalities with such a cheap MP3 player like this. Awesome!Cons: Doesn't have a rechargeable battery. The player takes more power from the battery so the battery lasts less time than the spec says.The play/pause function gets frozen if switched so fast, and I have to restart the whole thing (turn off and on back)."
4,Mom of 2,"I purchased this MP3 player for my daughters 10 birthday. This is her first and she loves it. I would recommend this player to anybody wanting a first MP3 player for their child or themselves. The only problem we have is that it locks up once in awhile, but usually if you turn it off and then turn it back on it resolves the problem. We also have it almost full of songs so that could be why it locks up sometimes. It holds about 250 songs. We also use Energizer rechargeable batteries because a friend told us it drains the batteries pretty quick and they work great."
4,Positive review of SanDisk,My kids and wife all have an iPod but I couldn't justify the cost because I don't use it that often so I bought the SanDisk. I've used it on two cross country airline trips thus far and it has been great. Easy to set up and download music. Besides being less expensive it has performed very well. Great product thus far.
3,SanDisk Sansa MP3 Shuffle,"This MP3 player has great sound and is very easy to use and operate. However it shuffles all my tracks which is not good when you are listening to CDs that are not music tracks, i.e teaching CDs and Books on CD."
1,Freezes up.,"I ordered two players. Each of them stopped working within 24 hours of taking them out of the box. After hitting the power button the player freezes on the initialization screen. The only button that will then work is the power on/off button. Don't waste your money, and more importantly, your time."
1,Don't Buy - disappointed kid on Christmas day,"DON'T BUY - I bought this for my son and it worked less than one hour on Christmas day. After transferring songs and checking the fm radio function, this player was turned off for lunch. When it was turned back on it locked up in the initializing screen and wont do anything."
4,Happy!,Bought this for my mother who is not very computer savy. I like the fact that you can plug the unit into your computer and drag your music/files to the player. You don't have to use software such as ITunes or Windows Media Player if you don't want too. Sound quality is good and unit is fairy easy to use.
5,Excellent alternative to an Ipod,"I've had my SanDisk for about 2 months now, and I love it. I only use it while working out, so I wanted an inexpensive alternative to an Ipod. Ipods, in my opinion, are over rated and too expensive, especially if, like me, you would only use it less than an hour a day. I know several people who have had so many problems with their Ipods. I have had no trouble at all with the SanDisk. It comes with an armband, and plastic protective case to prevent the screen from getting scratched. Its a great little player if you can't afford the hype of an Ipod."
1,Don't by this product,"This player is unpredictable and difficult to use. You can't transfer MP3 files directly to it and you must use Windows Media Player to manage it. Often actual songs end up not matching titles or not playing at all. It won't load an MP3 file not related to a CD, ie a sound file in MP3 format. It goes through a battery a week. This product should have a rating of minus 5 stars."
4,Sandisk Sansa m240,"I Use this little devil primarily for audio books since it remembers where you left off and goes right back. I find the sound qaulity to be much better than average and better than the Zen V plus that I also own. A big plus is that the battery is replaceable and requires only 1 AAA. Oh Yes, one can replace the battery and it still goes back to the place where one left off unlike so many others that loose there place during that process (great for audio books). Screen is hard to read but if you have enough light, it does have a blue backlight which works well, it should be ok."
1,I'd give it 0 stars if I could,This is the worst mp3 player I've ever used. I had a creative nano before which was decent and I also have the nano gen 3. I got this to play ebooks which were protected WMA files from the overdrive media console. On power up again it plays the track from the very beginning and not where I stopped before and for this reason I always have to remember where I left off. To make matters worse it doesn't even remember how long a track is and an hour track sometimes shows as only 30 min and 1 hour 30 min at other times. I wanna put this sansa mp3 player in the trash. Keep away and look at the competition. Get a zune or an ipod.
1,Another Freeze Up,"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my kids. Just like numerous other reviews, one froze up on the sansa screen after a couple days. Amazon exchanged it without hassle and the replacement froze up with the same problem within hours. There are definitely issues with this player and I would not buy it. I am going to return both and purchase a different player."
1,Piece of Junk Times TWO,"DO NOT PURCHASE this player, it is a piece of garbage! The first one I had froze after two days, so I returned it thinking it was just a lemon. When the replacement unit they sent froze after three days, I knew that I was dealing with a low quality product, totally unreliable. What sucks, too, is that there was no compensation from Amazon for the time and effort I had to put in to find a box (twice), pack it all in there (twice) and wait to hear about a replacement (twice). I am going to buy the real thing next time (iPod) because you get what you pay for."
1,Don't buy this item!!!!,"We bought three of these for the teens. We where going to get the iPOD Nano but figured for a few bucks cheaper they could have a screen to seen the songs, as well as the AM/FM radio. Well ALL THREE of them froze up within a day or two of each other - same as the other reviews. Hopefully we can get these exchanged without to much hassle. Definitely DON'T want another SanDisk product!!!!"
2,Avoid at all costs,"Two of the three we bought had problems. We sent them all back. The firmware locks up and is not recoverable. Some songs will not play, and when deleted later they play under different artist! The money you save over an Ipod is truly not worth it. We replaced all three with Ipods and everyone is happy!"
5,VERY easy to use,"I love this mp3 player. It is extremely easy to use and would be great for the computer illiterate. It's so easy to plug into the computer and transfer music. It is also easy to organize the play lists using the windows media player. However, you have to organize your play list on the computer the way you want it because once you get it onto the player there aren't many choices. Overall it's fabulous!"
4,Beats iPod hands down,"Forget the buzz about iPods, when it comes to durability, functionality and performance the SanDisk blows away iPod. It may be a silly little thing but what i like test is the very friendly design/shape for holding - It is perfect for exercise both to hold and switch songs and adjust volume. Try doing that with an iPod without coming to a complete stop from what ever you are doing. The Sansa also appears to be tougher - One ding on the iPod and boom - time to get a new one - Ever try to get Apple to repair one!!Try this out. Much better value for money and over-hyped and over priced iPod."
1,Terrible player...terrible website help...even worse customer service,"I received this MP3 player as a gift in December 2006...three months later it has completely stopped working. Sure Sandisk is going to replace my broken player, but I really don't want to use a player that obviously doesn't last longer than three months.Their product support website is terrible as well and their customer service agents are nearly useless...I will never buy another Sandisk product and caution you to avoid this company as well."
1,Not a good choice,I bought this player but it stopped working after one month of using. As I saw it is not the first feedback like that. I strongly recommend not to bue such players if you do not want to waste about $60
2,Great - While It Worked,"I realize that mine is just one experience among many, but be aware that my unit simply ceased functioning about three weeks after purchase. I thought at first that the batteries simply needed replacement, but the problem remained even after a fresh cell.On attempting to power up, the unit would flash a display very briefly, then shut down again.I don't know how ubiquitous this problem might be - there are always ""lemons"" among the sweet apples - but Caveat Emptor, nonetheless."
5,Got more than my money's worth!,"Works extremely well and has proven durable as well. I am really pleased at the volume, the ease of use with my computer and the durability of the product."
1,mp 3 player,"When I 1st got the player the volume button was stuck on Loud, and that was my only complaint. All I wanted was to switch it out to another one, But anyways' You can not turn it down at all. I emailed the company several times with no response at all I tried calling the 1800 number but no response. Now I love Amazon But I will Not Buy from this company ever again. Terrible Customer Service."
1,Did not work with downloading audio book,"I specifically bought this in order to listen to audio books downloaded from the library (free) or rented from a company [...] but after almost 3 hours on the phone with tech support, it still was not able to download and play audio books in the ""wma"" format. So, I had to return it. I did, however, purchase another MP3 player from Sansa called ""Sansa Clip"" and that works perfectly. They were about the same low price, so if you need an MP3 player for the purpose of listening to audio books, get the Sansa Clip [...]"
1,Trash,"This player is awful. It froze one month after purchase, leading to replacement from Sandisk. Upon receipt, the second player began a four month decline. Sound would come and go during playback, from full volume, to no volume, to everywhere in between. Finally, it died as well. I'm not wasting my time to see if Sandisk will replace it -- it's not worth my time.A second nuisance is that the sports arm band is made for weightlifters! I'm an average sized person, BMI right in the middle of normal, and the armband would not go tight enough to keep a snug fit during physical activity. Overall, it just seems like Sandisk put very little thought and testing into this product."
5,Nice MP3,Owned one of these for a couple of years with no issues. I use the player 4-5 times per week during workouts...I strongly suggest you buy the M200 Silicone case with the player...The unit seems to be fragile if not protected. You also want to buy upgraded earphones. JLab's at Amazon are very good.
4,Neat little package,"This MP3 player is tiny, lightweight, and easy to use. Perfect for travel either in the car or on a plane. I am enjoying mine!"
1,HORRABLE,"This is a horrable mp3 player, on the second or third time I tried to dowload music on it it froze up my computer and it did all of these wacky things to the mp3 player. I knew someone else and the same exact thing happened to them to, and it did not just happen to me just once but twice on two different mp3 players!"
3,Not Bad for Price,"This isn't bad for the price. I do have some complaints. It doesnt seem to hold that many songs. Only about 25 or so. It also freezes a lot, and right in the middle of a good song usually. The battery also only lasts a few hours. The ear buds are nice-- they fit very snuggly in your ears."
1,Factory Defect on SanDisk 240,"I thought I should alert customers that there was a bad batch of SanDisk mp3, m240s that were sent out during the holidays. We have one. They lock up and can't be used. The good news is that SanDisk customer support was very helpful and promised to replace the unit. Customer support for North America (866)726-3475"
4,good deal,"I used to have an Ipod shuffle and I think I like this Sansa better. You can see what you're listening to and skip to the next song. The sound is great and the buttons are easy to find. No comment about the headphones, I use my Sony ones. The download was much easier than ipod. Just click and drag. The one thing I don't like is that there is no way to hang this one around your neck. I got used to that before and now strapping it to my arm with the included elastic feels weird. The best part is no charging!! I have used it almost daily for two weeks and haven't changed the battery."
2,Works fine with Linux with MP3 bitrates below 128K,I bought this MP3 player at Office Depot on sale. I am able to use it successfully with SUSE Linux 9.3. I can transfer a 200MB file in 75 seconds so the USB 2.0 interface works well. The one problem with this player is it will not play MP3s with bit rates over 128K for MP3 files. Since I have many at 192K this is a severe limitation. I contacted SanDisk technical support and they confirmed that they do no support MP3's over 128K and Windows format over 64K. I would try another product next time.
4,"Pretty Good, especially for the price!",This product works great with iMesh music downloads and also with windows media player. It's user friendly and I love that it also has fm radio with it. I'm glad I purchsed it.
1,same problem,"like many other posts already listed, I had the same problem. I got this for my 14 yr old daughter, as an alternative to the expensive IPod. The reviews on it looked really great. She took it with her 2 days after christmas on a trip from Pennsylvania to California and she didnt' even make it out of the COUNTY before it locked up and refused to work. I have a very unhappy 14 yr old who is spending the next 5 days on a band trip with no means to listen to her music! and I am a very annoyed mother who expected a better product."
1,Defective headphone jack connection,"I have owned and used this player for 3 1/2 months and now need to buy another player because there is no connection when I insert the headphone jack. Reading reviews before buying I came across a complaint about this, along with the suggestion to leave the headphone jack plugged in to reduce wear and tear. I did just that, but still will need to replace an otherwise working unit."
2,Bad customer service,I recieved my mp3 players which were suppose to be silver. After they were delivered I got a email saying they made a mistake and put a pink one in and that the silver was not available anymore. I emailed them back to see if both of them were going to be silver because I had them shipped to my In-Law house and that I really needed one to be silver because one was for a boy and never got a reply. The product I bought worked fine but I had to go and pay a higher price for them somewhere else.
1,"do not buy this staff, broken in less than 3 month","seldom use it, yet the LCD screen broken within 3 months. Called the customer service, the worst customer service I even met. I was asked to send a picture of broken MP3 to them. Sent 4 times they still can not get it. Decide to give up. Won't buy any sandisk product anymore."
4,My 10-yr old loves this mp3 player!,"I bought this mp3 player for my daughter for Christmas (who was then 9). She absolutely loves it. The player locked up one time, but once I took the battery out, put it back in, and turned it back on, it worked fine, and we haven't had any problems since. It's been 5 months, and it's still going strong. I would recommend this player. The only thing is when I ordered this back in November'07, I only paid about $30 (including shipping), so I don't know what's up with this current price of $99."
1,Locked up first time,I gave this gift as a present for my father. I really wanted an mp3 player that had an FM tuner so he could utilize it at the gym. The first time he attempted to load the device with music it locked up and would not let him do anything further. I spent several hours troubleshooting and only found other people with similar problems and no help from the manufacturer that worked. At this time I am having trouble getting SanDisk to respond to my support requests so there is a chance I may not even be able to get it returned. Bad hardware or needing a software update happens in technology devices and I am willing to work with that. Bad customer support on top of it makes this product a disappointing waste of time and money.
3,Poor review,"The headphones/sound system ended up being in one earphone only. Dropped the MP3 player once, and since then, sound is erratic, unclear. Deleting songs from player did not delete them, even using Rhapsody. Not thrilled with product.."
1,Defective,"It's frozen, won't turn off without taking the battery out, won't respond to any buttons or being plugged into the computer, computer won't recognize it as a flash disk, can't update the firmware, nothing. I called Sandisk support and did everything they could think of, nothing."
4,Good functionality; capacity more limited than one would expect,"The device is well-designed and executed; music is well-organized and easy to access. However, system files seem to occupy a fixed amount of storage space; my guess is that the 2 GB model would provide more than double the amount of space for music files as a result."
1,A Bad Product,"After a few days, the player freeze, and unusable. I look up the reviews in the internet. Turned out that a lot of other people have the same problem. I have to return it. My advice: DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! It has an inherent defect in the hardware."
1,Major disappointment,"Initially was very impressed with sound quality,features,and compact size.I'd buy another if the bugs were guaranteed to be illiminated. Unfortunately, of the two that I'd purchased as Xmas gifts, one ceased to function the day after Xmas and the other, two weeks later. Both were returned to vendor."
1,Froze up in 3 days.,"Apparently there is a serious design flaw in this product, judging by the insane number of reviewers who've said the same thing. It works for a few days, and then freezes up on the opening screen. Nothing brings it back after that. Mine went back. So disappointing!"
5,"Love it, Especially the radio feature","To all you MP3 player lovers...get one with a radio feature. I cannot recommend it enough. The ScanDisk Sansa M240 is terrific, nice size, easy to use. I never used the headphones that came with it, so can't comment on them. I use instead the Panasonic RP HS41 headphones and they are awesome. The clear plastic case that comes with it is great."
5,Use every day,"I bought my first one about a year ago and use it every day to listen to podcasts during my walk. I also use it the car for music and podcasts when I Travel. I made the mistake of putting some music, that my wife liked, on it and letting her it for a few days. Now I have 2 or should I say I have the old one and she has the new one. For the money you can't go wrong."
1,christmas presents,I purchased three of the 1GB units for christmas.Two have died by May. I would not recomend buying these's units.
4,mp3 player,"This is a good player, very satisfied with it. The only drawback in the instructions that come with it are TERRIBLE!!! It was so frustrated to figure out."
2,voice recorder doesn't play,"It is a good mp3 player but it is not sofisticated. It is very hard or impossible to edit songs and playlist in the device.Also, I can record the voice to the m240 but It won't play at all. every time I tried to replay ends up in crash! I discovered that it stores the files as WAV format. It plays well if you download the recorded WAV files to the computer. but I don't feel like convert that file back to MP3 and store as an album back to the player."
2,Disappointing,"I researched for days and months to find the right mp3 player. Considering the price, I thought the sandisk brand would suit my needs. It turned out to be very disappointing experience. When you look at the pictures of the sansa, you assume It is going to be somewhat thin, but not as thin as the ipod nano. Sadly, you will be mistaken because it is FAT has heck. The radio and voice recording are awful and produce poor quality sound and static. Also, what's up with the battery cover? It looked loose and it shooked. The plastic material used to make the sansa looked and felt extremely cheap and non-durable.It's not worth it. In less than a day, I returned the sansa to circuit city and brought the ipod nano."
2,It doesn't work with MAC,It doesn't work with MAC...It should be work at least as a drive...I did a firmware upgrade but the results remains the same
5,sandisk sansa mp3 player,"this is one of the cutest mp3 players that i have ever seen.Ive tried to get them from local stores like target or walmart but i was constantly having issues with the products they sell there.I found this one on amazon and figured i would give it a shot.It turned out to be one of my best purchases because this product is lightweight,small and compact, it holds almost 400 songs and the screen lights up.I like the fact that it runs off of a triple a battery because i feel that charging it constantly ruins the internal battery that some of these mp3 players have nowadays.I reccommend this product to parents who want to get their child something that will not break or bend...something that is fun to look at and holds a large capacity of music for such a great price!"
5,about this mp3 player,this mp3 player is great. I'v had for more than a year and it still works perfectly.
3,An OK MP3 player,"The player is OK. It uses up a lot of memory so you can't use AAA rechargeable batteries, or else you have to them keep constantly recharged. There isn't that much memory, so if you put a couple of albums on there, it uses most of it up. I tend to use it for the FM radio, which works well in a metropolitan area with stations close to me. The sound quality is good. I got it because my iRiver got water damaged (my own fault - duh!!) and I wanted a cheaper replacement. It comes with the arm strap, so I can avoid the water damage like I had with the device. I don't regret getting it, but I wouldn't recommend it if you want a high-end player."
5,Nice product,"I think this is a nice mp3 player. Not complicated, easy to use and have had no problems thus far. The ear phones tend to move out of place. I've had it for over 3 months."
4,For a fairly inexpensive 1 GB mp3 player...,"It does a good job, for the most part. I love this brand, but I wouldn't buy this particular player again. It can't hold very many songs, and the user manual seemed to be lacking in explanations for some things(like the voice recorder option, which I still haven't figured out). I like that it has a built-in FM radio, and the earphones are pretty comfortable. Most other earphones don't fit in my ears, but these ones are nice and padded(you have to put the pads on yourself though, which got a tad bit frustrating). Overall, a nice, cute, little mp3 player."
4,Very good value,"It's not the greatest MP3 player ever; but anybody who is buying it at this price realizes that.It's got a nice design and interface, and while it might make the most particular audiophiles turn their nose up, it's a very good value."
1,JUNK!!!,"I bought TWO of these players as presents for my children for Christmas, and BOTH of them stopped working within days of eachother. I mean, they just FROZE...we couldn't even turn them off!!! We went to the online Sandisk web help site...nothing they suggested worked, which was all very complicated, let me add. SO DISAPPOINTING!! Oh, and by the way? Can't get replacements from Amazon, because they are no longer available from supplier...think they pulled them? Now we are awaiting a refund from Amazon, which they assure me will come soon. Not Amazon's fault, though...they have been more than accomadating with the return process."
5,Who needs an I-pod?,"Ok, some info on me: 33 year old male, family of 4. I use the Sandisk at the gym. I have been putting it through its paces for 4 months and I gotta tell you, I love this thing. It has stood up to a lot of abuse from both me and my 2 kids. The arm strap is perfect for the gym as well. I did buy replacement earbuds, the kind that goes over the ears. The ones that came with it weren't bad, but I have never found a set of normal ear buds that were comfortable for me. It sounds great! The only down side is there is not enough warning when the battery is going to die. It isn't that big of a deal, just keep your eye on your battery gauge."
4,Great for Unlimited Song Downloading Suscriptions!,"The SanDisk Sansa M240 has an LCD display with a backlight, however it's often hard to read because of poor contrast. The Creative Zen V and V+ have a much brighter display, are much more compact than the M240, and can display color photos at good resolution (the M240 can't display any photos at all), yet they're also compatible with Napster-To-Go. I'd recommend either of the Creative Zen V/V+ models over the SanDisk M240.The Play For Sure designation for MP3 players, and its logo on this particular MP3 player, don't guarantee it'll work for a Napster-To-Go subscription. Fortunately, the M200 series of MP3 players from SanDisk (including the M240) do work with Napster-To-Go so you can legally download an unlimited number of songs to up to 3 PCs and up to 3 MP3 players in one household."
5,Great MP3 player for the price.,"Easy to use. Did not have to read manual, just plugged it in thru USB port. Can use MediaPlayer or other program to transfer music. Compatable with subscription music. Lightweight, good design."
2,"Loved it, but......","Enjoyed everything about this mp3 player. It was easy to use, and after I upgraded my WMP it worked great with my computer. The battery lasted much longer than I thought it would. On the fourth night I set the sleep timer for 15 minutes and drifted off to beautiful music. The next day, I discovered that it would not turn on, or off, so I changed the battery to no avail. Not wanting to give up, I called Sandisk customer support and after I upgraded firmware and followed all instruction by a very patient, polite rep, we gave up, and he suggested I send it back to Amazon. I would have given it five stars, and Sandisk customer service five stars, except... I have to send it back, which is disappointing and inconvenient. I am ordering the e250."
1,Sorry ... it is junk.,"Yep, I started using it and enjoyed the amount of songs that it could hold ... for about two weeks. Now, whenever I turn on the button, all I get the the boot screen and nothing else ... it's just frozen there forever. Personally, I'm going to buy something just a little more sturdy next time ..."
1,Piece of Junk,This is the only product I have ever returned to Amazon in over 5 years and I order everything from Amazon. This was a Christmas gift to my daughter and it stopped working before lunch on Christmas day. The main screen froze up and simply wouldn't work.
1,Another one bites the dust,"I bought three of these; one is frozen like all the other ones you will read about, another has come close to freezing up, and another one hasn't had a problem. My problems started when I used the voice recording feature. On the one that came close to freezing up, I haven't had any problems since I've stopped using the voice recording feature. We'll see what Sandisk does about replacing my useless one. Don't risk buying one now, there are definite problems."
1,Sadness and failure 3 days after Christmas,"What can I say? Like with so many other customers,we couldn't get the thing to work after a fewdays of playing OK, the thing wouldn't cure itself,and the support was impossibly un-navigable.I join the many baffled and upset customers.I sent it back to Amazon (they did send a free shippingsticker), but I haven't heard anything yet.I hope I do: my daughter is waiting for a decent player."
3,Plays music with good sound quality but . . .,"The sound quality is pretty good even with the factory headphones. The device plays music files including WMA subscription DRM protected. However the user interface is very weak. In general it is easy to use, but it is not very feature rich or functional. It is a bit complicated to remember how to get the device into MTP rather than MSC mode when you attach it to the computer. The randomize feature does not allow you to go back along the current random playlist. Only one playlist can be played at a time. It does not have a volume normalizing feature.All in all it is decent, and it is cheap. However, if you want a player with a slick interface, this is not for you."
5,No complaints at all,I've used this player nearly every day for the last 9 months and I've never had any problems with it (and I've dropped it a few times on the ground and it was fine).
1,Please recall this MP3,"My son's stopped working within a month of purchase. We looked online to see if others have had the same problem. It turns out that this model was defective, but the company is still selling it. One buyer had to return their MP3 player 3 times before he got one that wasnt defective. We've also had to return ours. It's hit or miss so research first...before you buy."
1,Yes... it broke after 1 week.,It worked great for about a week. Then it got stuck on the start up screen. I've sent it back and haven't got the refund yet...
1,MP3 Player freezes up!,"I ordered one of these on Jan. 4th. My grandson used it for less than a week before it ""froze"" and would not play. I returned it and ordered another one on Jan. 17...same thing happened in less than 3 days. I also returned this one. I still have not received my money back for these defective players, although Amazon emailed me today and said they will credit soon. AND my grandson still does not have an MP3 player. DON'T BUY THIS ONE!"
1,This MP3 player would be nice if it worked.,"It worked for a few days and then died. Exchanged for another one thinking we just got a bad one. That one worked for a few weeks and then died in the exact same way as the previous one.The MP3 player is a nice design, but it just doesn't work.Don't waste your money."
1,Broke after little more than 1 month,"This was great in the beginning, purchased on December 28, 2006. Then I had problems with the songs I downloaded. They disappeared when I did not delete them. I kept getting error messages. Then the stupid thing decided to turn on and display the name Sansa in the screen. The item won't turn off unless I take out the battery. Nor will the item play any music or fm radio. I have tried calling customer service but the hold times have been longer than I could afford to wait. So I will keep trying to call. Maybe it will one day work again."
1,"As others, mine froze","Worked great for about two weeks. Easy to use, nice and lightweight, held plenty of music, great for wearing while running. It was working when I put it away one evening, but the next day when I took it out it froze. It turned on, but none of the buttons worked -- just like numerous other reviewers experienced. Four stars for the first two weeks, zero stars after."
2,disappointed,"While researching MP3 players for my teenage son, I read the reviews about this one. Some said it was great; some said it was a piece of junk that didn't work from the get-go. I decided there were enough favorable reviews to give it a try, so I ordered it, wrapped it in Christmas paper, and held my breath. It was just what he wanted (yippee for Mom!), and worked great -- for a little over 2 weeks. Then it froze up on the initial screen. Nothing we tried worked. So I sent back to Amazon returns the other day, and will look for another MP3 player, since they don't have any more of these in stock. I'm really sad about it, because my son said it was really easy to load songs onto, and even easier to use."
3,Correction - one worked and one froze up,"I previously did a review regarding how this player froze up, within 3 days, and that I was returning both. I did decide to try the second one and what do you know, that one is working fine so far. Hmmmmm. So, one works and one doesn't. Guess the problem isn't with me or my computer, but rather a bad batch of MP3 players."
2,Player freezes up,"I was excited to receive this player for my 9-year-old daughter. We easily downloaded songs, only to have the player freeze on the main screen only hours after it was out of the package. After calling the company and trying to reset the item, they suggested to return it. After looking at reviews about the Sandisk, it appears that this is a problem that needs to be fixed. There were many complaints about the player freezing up. I chose a refund, as it would have been too long of a wait for my daughter."
3,How do you define new?,"I bought the Sandisk 1Gb and expected it to come with a case but it was just wrapped up in bubble plastic. Should it not have come with a case just like the other MP3 I bought?As for the item itself, it's a gift so I cannot rate the product. So I hope it's not a refurbished or used item."
3,Pretty Good,I bought this product about three to four weeks ago and I think it is great but the disk that came with it is not compatible with Windows Vista so I had to use Yahoo (the two do not seem to get along too well). When I bought this product I had no idea how basic it would be; it does not shuffle or anything. It also only held about 150 to 175 songs and that is not alot. To top it all off it eats batteries. This is okay for a child but not for an adult who loves music because it is too limited to what it can do.
4,Great--Almost,I've found this player to be very user friendly--easy to operate and select the reading you want. My one complaint is that it takes Windows XT to operate. Built-in compatability issues annoy me.
5,player,I am enjoying the sandisc player so much that i took it on a cruise and used it everynight....love it!
4,Good but.......,I'm happy with the performance of the SanDisk Sansa M240. It sounds great and is easy to use but.... It's a pain in the you know what to get the songs organized on the player. I still haven't gotten the songs to play in order by album or artist. Also when putting the songs on the player it sometimes doubles the song.I am however very pleased by everything else. The trouble with the organizing of the songs is a small price to pay to get a cheap good sounding player.
2,Cheap and cheaply made,"Ok, I bought this item because it took no software to run it and it used 1 AAA battery. Well, I had it 6 months and suddenly today the power button made a clicking noise and now it won't work. And I didn't drop mine 1000 times like the person above me. (heh) I'm slightly upset, although I do remember reading reviews about this sort of ""suddenly stopped working"" problem before I bought it but I figured at the price I got it for, who cared! Well, I care now. I will remember next time that you get what you pay for. Bad Sansa...BAD!"
3,You get what you pay for,"It is definitely worth the price, but it isnt anything fancy either. I bought it for my 11 year old for christmas. she had no problem figuring out how to use the buttons. It is somewhat of a hassle to sync the songs from windows media player to the player, but other than that I have no problems with it. It isn't really loud, but for 35 dollars, what did I really expect?"
1,How misleading! x 2,"I purchased 2 of these a few months ago. One for me and one for my other half. I purchased it thanks to the good reviews it recieved. It worked good for a good while, considering how often I used it. Now, if I try to listen to a tune or two, there's a 99.99% chance it will turn off for no apparent reason. And, to top it off, it's difficult to turn back on. The same goes for the other one I purchased. I highly advise anyone not to buy this one if you are in the market for a mp3 player. Just imagine..you are in the middle of a strenous walk, rocking to a favorite tune and *boom* it's gone. Makes for a boring and maddening workout."
3,"Hey, hey, Lily!","This was Combustible Edison second or third album, depending on if you count theFour RoomsSoundtrackor not. It is somewhat of a disappointment. Not to say that it's bad. It's good, but not to the standards of their wonderful first album. Still, fans of the lounge music revival of the 1990s will probably enjoy it."
2,Not Fully Realized,you may want to make sure you have both of the other combustable cds before you get this one.you may also want to make sure you have the best of les baxter and martin denny and esquivel and the lounge core comp and sergio mendes brazil 66 and breakfast at tiffany's and vampiros lesbos tipsy prince charming and wagon christs tally ho.
2,Retro Lounge Music,"I'm not a fan of this style of music, but I've found that most modern renditions of classic music styles tends to sound unoriginal and stylized almost into a caricature of the original style, overemphasizing the obvious features of that style.I tend to laugh at this album because it seems like a parody of the 60's. There's not much original content here, and the album is only good for a couple of listens. There's much better stuff out there. You can still get original recordings of 60's music."
4,Stands Up Well Over Time,"Listened to this recently after years on the shelf (shelved not because I didn't like it - only because I pathologically buy too many CDs and albums, and I had to move on to newer stuff). This was The Grifter's first full length after ""Crappin You Negative"", which was a universally acclaimed album. Start there if you're new to The Grifters. It would have been extremely hard to follow up that one with an equally acclaimed release. The switch to Sub Pop and better production probably raised questions among the critics and faithful fans. I remember being one of them, but mildly. As it turns out a dozen or so years later, this is a great album and stylistically one of the band's most diverse. Great stuff. If you generally have a low tolerance for noise and lo-fi production, this would be The Grifters album to get. If you like lo-fi, ""One Sock Missing"" is the one to get. And ""Eureka EP"" shouldn't be overlooked by either camp."
3,OK Book!,"This book is definitely for people with a experience on Corel. You get some good advise but it needs a little more detail on explanations in ""how to""."
1,Not helpfull.,I was disappointed when I got that book. It got a lot of pages but it is not as informative as it should be. I had to discover CorelDraw 10 on my own and the book wasn't helpful at all.
4,The Class Commited to papper,"THis book really helped me with this new version of CorelDraw.... I prevesloy owned version 8, when I got 10 my mnd was blowen away... I live in southern California and there are not alot of local classes for this program. Luckaly I stumbled upon this book and got a sorta... Teacher that never tells you what to do. It has yet not to answer question I have. This is one of the best... most complex graphic programs That I like rather than adobe! (age 14! yes I am a graphic/web desinger!) contact of Birdboy2000@hotmail.com"
3,Patience Is a Virtue,"The people who complained about difficulty pouring from the pitcher are correct, it can be messy. The blender is loud, but it does the job IF you allow it time to work.If you are impatient, you will be frustrated by an incomplete job. I use mine for frozen daiquiris and the result is excellent, but slow.So in a nutshell: thorough; noisy; slow."
1,Look elsewhere,"One lousy blender:The base leaks if not screwed on just right.As the leaks drip down the front of the blender, the buttons become inoperable.Clunky design in general. . . . ."
2,"Cuisinart Blender, Looks the part.................BUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This blender is good looking, heavy and inexpensive if you purchase the refurbished unit.However, it does not do a very good job of blending.It takes a long time to blend things and even then it does not completely blend all the ingredients to a uniform smooth consistency.In hindsight it would probably be better buying a unit that doesn't look as good, but did the job it was bought to do."
1,Somewhat OK blender.,The blade has locked up twice so far while blending chick peas.. yes.. chick peas and I now refuse to buy the $35 part based on morals. This is the blender that could have been if not designed to fail.
2,no better than old one,"Bought this thinking I was gettin a decent product. Although I haven't used it much trying to make a soothie took forever, kept having to shut off unit to mix the fruit to the bottom. Also smelt like something was burning.over-all not much better than the $2.00 blender I bought at a garge sale"
4,Reconded blender,"A very nice blender and it looks new. Very powerful, the price was good, and free shipping. No complaints."
5,Great powerful latin ska,"This latest Komando Moriles record is the best work from this spanish ska band. 15 tracks that includes powerful latin ska, rock steady, reggae & ""mambo ska""."
2,A good idea but........,I bought this for use with my Palm M130. The only positive part about this is the runner's log. It is simple to use and easy to pull up old records to check your progress. The other programs are time consuming and it is faster to keep records with pen and paper. The idea is a good one but it still needs some work to get the bugs out.
3,little disappointing,we got this after listening to a sample and the sample is the shortest piece in the CD. still great talent
1,Concierto de Aranjuez,This is the most stilted performance of Rodrigo's masterpiece.Romero sounded like he was falling asleep while playing. The tempo of 2nd movement is much too slow.
4,I thought it was great.,The way that there was a goblin/dwarf in the beginning was cool and Artemis Entreri just made you want to punch him.
4,Hmmm,"Heh heh, boy Drizzt looks like Jarlaxle just snuck up on him and gave him the lethal drow wedgie. Ow. Why is it on every cover the drow look so messed up? I thought elves were supposed to be these mystical beautiful critters. All the drow look like they need alpha hydroxy or oil of o'lay bad. Anyway this book was good, not as good as DET but good."
3,Good but not the best...,"It was a good book overall, however it was not extiting at all... some of the fights were very dull. It did not had any momentum building up that wanted to keep me reading it... I just finished it so I could move on to the next book of the collection... which I'm hoping is better."
3,"Good book, but some flaws.","This is a good sequel to the Icewind Dale and Dark Elf Trilogy. It has really good battle parts and some nice dialogue and description. However, it's not his best. The battle parts seem to take up the whole book. It takes forever for Bruneor and gang to find Drizzt, and when they do, the book's over. The idea of changing from a human into a halfling was very cool. Once again, Artemis shows how great a charecter he is. However, I do feel sorry for Catti-brie. I'm not gonna tell you what happened, but it almost made me cry. There are some problems with the book, but hopefully that will be solved in the next book, which i'm glad this book wasn't his last Drizzt book. Enjoy! Rating:Teen has bloodshed and language. END."
2,Not his best work,I'm sorry to say that that's one of my least favorit salvatore's books. you can see that this book was written as a new money macine. the plot is too wierd and too boring and the book doesn't tell you something exiting or new (exept for one unnessery death). The chapter they added to the paperbeck edition was bad and you can see it's there only to start a new series so the publishers would make more money. I don't know how was the trilogy afterwords but this book just don't worth the money
3,The drow are after Drizzt again.,"Good book, but the theme has already been played out. It seems that the Drow Priestess Vierna, Drizzt's sister, and Dinin are after Drizzt again in hopes to regain the Spider Queen's favor. They have already done this twice and have failed both times. Although this is a new twist the idea is getting old."
3,"Battles, battles, battles","RA Salvatore created a monster with the Drizzt character, a monster that he can no longer control. Fans want stories, and as long as he gets paid, he'll probably keep writing them. This can be, for the most part, good. As long as Mr. Salvatore find a plot.That crack is not to say that 'The Legacy' is a bad read - indeed, it is not. It's simply to say that this entire book clings to one long, lengthy battle occuring. Sure, it involved lots of people, often split up into little groups, and it spans miles of underground passageways, but really...there is little here.Some passing attempt is made at strong character development, and while several undergo major changes, ""development"" is not quite the right word. Rather, they go from Stereotype A to Stereotype C with no transition in between. (in all fairness, the incident in the novel that causes all this is also quite sudden)Not a bad fantasy novel by any means, but not a great one either."
2,for kids only...,"Really and truly, if you are actually a *reader*, do your best to ignore those folks who proclaim the works of Salvatore to be ""the best books i ever read."" Comments such as those say a lot about just how much (and what) they read.The Salvatore novels are mildly entertaining forays into fantasy, helped out by the AD&D logos on the books. Books such as these are the fantasy equivilent of those awful romance novels that line the shelves of your local pharmacy...little wonder that you can often buy these books at the pharmacy as well..."
1,"kill, fight, kill!! main, slash!","Wow, look at me, I'm RA Salvatore, a man so inept at writing that I string together one hack and slash fest after another and call it a plot. Oh boy, look at my adoring fans drool on their power-ranger shirts, I must be GOOD! Look, this battle progresses to this next battle, all which culminates in a big final battle. Pretty deep stuff, huh? Wow oh wow, literature at it's finest, right? Yeah, nice. Look at me, i'm RA Salvatore. Blah blah blah."
1,not the Floursack Towel of yesterday! substandard quality,"I own nearly a dozen of these towels that we've used so much over the years they now need replacing. Had I known that Now Design would cheapen the fabric quality I would have ordered a lifetime supply back when I made my first purchase. The original Floursack towel is the best for absorption and finish, and durable in spite of its lack of bulk in the towel drawer. These new towels I just received are pathetically thin. If you hold them up to the light you can see right through. Not true with my older towels. How much did you save Now Design by eliminating that extra thread or two woven throughout the towel? you've lost this loyal customer. I'll be searching the internet for another manufacturer. disappointing."
3,"Great gift, but...",Love these blocks! I had them as a kid and was excited to buy a set for our house now. My only concern is that they are coated with Formaldehyde....whats up with that?
2,"Blocks do not look like the picture. In comparison to picture, they are very, very small.","What a disappointment! The picture is NOT a fair comparison to the actual size of the blocks. If you want a set of blocks that a child could build a SMALL house on the top of a coffee table, these blocks are for you. However, if you want large blocks (like in the picture) look elsewhere."
4,Ball shaped wooden block pieces-lack of,"This looks like a great play set. However, how come it does not have a very important shape - a ball? I truly hope you will add the ball blocks to your set. I would purchase it for my grand-daughter, then."
2,"We have not used it, even down the line.","I love Mellisa and Doug and was excited to get my daughter her first set of blocks last Christmas. Unfortunately I believe this may not have been the best set selection for a toddler (2yrs). Very large heavy blocks, not to stable in a carpet setting. Still I am not certain if it was that or the over all design of them but they have sat on the shelf less used than pretty much almost every other toy. I think if I had started with a lighter set we would very likely have gotten far more use.**UPDATE** a year later and my daughter has gotten little to no use out of this toy. I believe it may be due to the rather large and unusual block size along with the limited number of blocks. She plays with blocks at playdates, day care, etc, but these blocks do not gain or keep her attention (though it sits out across from her bed every day).If I were purchasing again I would definitely select a more traditional starter block set."
5,Great Blocks,"These are great kindergarten size blocks. I couldn't find large blocks at any store and was excited to find these on Amazon. It comes with a great wooden box to store them in and my kids have spent hours building with them. These are durable, and wooden blocks are great educational toys that never get outdated. I can pass these on to my grandchildern!"
3,Great Set but Buyer Beware,I haven't actually opened the set because it is wrapped and under the tree but it looks like a great set for our boys (ages 3 and 2)I would recommend price shopping before you buy because I JUST found the exact set (40 piece instead of 60) at our local Sams Club for $20...at that price I could have gotten two or three sets instead of this one!
4,Melissa and Doug wooden blocks,"The only way to improve this collection would be to have a removable cover on the box. Otherwise, it is excellent and our two and half year old grand daughter had a wonderful time with them!"
5,My 4 and 2yos love these!,"Great purchase. We've built a town for Polly Pocket and friends. :) The 2yo like to build and tear down... my 4yo plays and plays and plays. It's great!Also, I imagine that later on we will want another set, but this quantity is enough for now. We combine them with a smaller set of unit blocks (16 pieces) and it's enough for us."
5,Love these blocks,YOu can't go wrong with these basic blocks. MY kids have gotten years of use out of these. I bought them for a really good deal but clicked 1 click checkout and missed that you have to select free super saver shipping so beware! I ended up paying double what I intended because of the steep shipping cost! That still doesn't mean I don't love the product though.
2,Plan Toys better,"These M&D; are OK but the quality is inferior to PlanToys. I did notice a chemical type odor upon opening the package and it isn't true solid wood. It has the california 93120 compliant for formaldehyde phase 2 sticker on it. It is made in Thailand so at least its not China.I wound up getting the PlanToys Plan Preschool 50 Unit Blocks, much better quality IMO. They are real hard wood with absolutely no odor. No it doesn't come with a storage box but I will use my own."
3,Beware of wood filler,"Please be cautious if you have young children who might chew on these blocks! Some of the blocks have wood filler in them. My son mouthed a block with filler and was able to chew the filler off. When the filler is wet, you can scrape it off with your fingernail. Who knows what kind of glue and chemicals are used in the filler."
3,we feel jipped,"We ordered these blocks thinking we were getting 60 blocks- wow! But when our son opened them we were greatly disappointed in the amount of large blocks vs. small pieces made from the scraps. There are only 2 large long blocks in the whole set. There are plenty of little pieces but as those of us who played with blocks when we were young know, it's the large ones that help you create the big towers and castles. This is what makes building with blocks so much fun! There was also a large piece of Styrofoam inserted under the blocks to give them ""lift"" and make it seem like there were more blocks in the crate. There really should be many more large pieces and not so many small ones. Very disappointed!"
5,Good Preschool Blocks,"I was a little worried when I first ordered these, because I was worried they were really small, but their size is perfect and there are plenty of shapes to choose from. I especially like that they aren't painted, and that they come in a box so you can put them away in when you're done."
5,"Great set of blocks, fun for everyone!","I think this is an excellent set of blocks. Very classic and sturdy. I see this being one of those things that when the kids are older, they look back on it and get nostalgic about playing with the blocks. As an adult, this is one of those toys thats actually fun to play with as well, and it's nice to have something more constructive for the kids to do than just watch TV!"
5,Perfect Present for a Little One,"Our daughter loves these. She is now starting to use the blocks to build gates and houses for her toy dog. They are very durable and well built.When she got them for her birthday all the kids started playing with them. There was a 1.5 yrs old, 3 yrs old, 5 yrs olds, 7 yr old, and a 9 yr old all playing with the blocks. I have fun building with them when playing with my daughter too."
4,pretty good blocks,"Good blocks, perhaps a bit too old for a 3yr old, but he'll grow into them. You don't want to live below a toddler that has these blocks."
4,Sturdy toy,This is made of thick strong wood. A must have for your child's imagination. We use it all the time and never get tired of it. The best blocks I have ever seen.
5,The kids love this simple toy.,"Of all the thousands and thousands of dollars we've spent on toys for our 3- and 7- year olds over the years, this is one of the few ""successes"", meaning it's something that is actually played with regularly instead of just one or two times. The kids build so many creative and interesting things with these blocks from stages to buildings to schools, it's awesome. I highly recommend this toy."
4,Quality,We were looking for some simple heavy duty blocks. Found them! These are amazing. Quality and durable. We have out them to the test and would purchase again.
5,Quality construction,"These blocks always are a hit with my grandchildren. They are sturdy, good sized and there are enough. Two sets are even better for when several are working together."
3,Good product Overall,Well packaged. fast shipment. It would have been nice if it had been made of Maple (more durable than hardwoods used overseas where the product was made) No false advertizing here just a wish of higher quality
5,All Little Guys Should Have Some,"We purchased these blocks, along with the Melissa and Doug unit blocks on wheels, for our great-nephew. He loves them and plays with them constantly. His mom and dad even join in on the fun! We remember his dad playing with similar blocks when he was a child. They are simple but inspirational toys. They make a wonderful, inexpensive gift. The Melissa and Doug toys tend to be durable, well built ones. This product is definitely recommended."
5,60-piece set of wooden blocks,"2 year old Granddaughter has loved playing with smaller sets of blocks she had so we decided on a larger set. Her eyes were as big as saucers when she opened the box and saw all those blocks. She absolutely loves them. They are well made, smooth and have fun shapes. Her older brother enjoys them just as well."
5,These blocks are very well made!,It is nice to see good craftsmanship and we definitely see a good quality product with these blocks. Even the box that holds the blocks is well made. Each block in the box has been sanded well and so we haven't seen any splinters with these.The whole package is quite heavy when all of the blocks are in the box. We normally don't find these blocks all over the house because of the weight of it all I think.Thanks Melissa and Doug for another quality product.
5,A Must Have Toy!,"In a world of battery operated toys - we decided Santa should go ""back to the basics"". These blocks have already gotten more use than any other holiday gift! Our whole family loves them! The creativity is endless! A must have!"
5,Creative Play,"These blocks were a Christmas gift to my 3.5 yr. old son. He has built cities, constructed roads, devised bridges, and created other imaginative uses for these blocks. He loves to put them away too as it comes with a sturdy, wooden box. He will have them for a long time, and I will keep them to pass to his children."
5,Super blocks,These blocks come in a great wooden box for storage and are larger so they are fun for small hands. Great value prompt shipping. Buy with confidence.
5,great blocks,Ordered these for my 2 grandsons and they love playing with the blocks. They are well made and keeps them busy.
5,The exact ones you had as a kid,"These blocks are the same sturdy plain wooden blocks we all played with as children. Made of hard wood, sanded smooth and left unfinished. As an adult, I am enjoying them just as much as my toddler.When you think of your child playing with simple wooden blocks-- these are the ones."
5,A Must-Have Toy,"My twins love these blocks...and I'm pretty sure we'll be ordering another set. They love to stack them high and line them up long. We make roads, bridges, buildings, etc. We also have the Melissa and Doug wooden trucks and street signs--a perfect set for budding city planners! Grab a set of animals, trains, and people and you're in for endless hours of creative play. Great starter set!"
5,M&D 60 piece standard unit blocks,These blocks are great! And they come in a great wood box to store them in. I have two kids and went ahead and got two box's because a few other reviews recommended it. And I'm glade i did. If your looking for some great blocks i would defiantly recommend these.
5,Durability of wooden blocks,"I bought these blocks as Christmas gift for my son and he loves to build bridges over his race track for his race cars. I knew he would love to play with these wooden blocks because as a teacher, I have these blocks in my classroom and my students love to build with them. I prefer wooden blocks over cardboard or plastic blocks because of their durability and are made of natural products, such as wood."
5,Wonderful set of blocks,"My son and daughter (4 and 2) love these blocks. They are sturdy and come in a box that can be used as a building platform. Like previous reviews, I bought two sets for the bigger projects. My son built complex 39 (NASA), and added his space shuttle and astronauts. Just a lot of fun and great use of imagination. Has replaced saturday morning cartoons for months."
4,Measure standard unit if using with another brand,"I was very pleased to find ""standard unit blocks* at a reasonable price. They are well made and the ""units"" align perfectly. I had one dissapointment when I started playing with them with my grandson. He already had a set of ""standard unit blocks"" but there weren't enough blocks to really build anything with, so I was hoping the two sets could be used together. Turns out the set he already had uses a slightly larger basic unit module and the math concept is lost when using the two sets together. I just put the old set away since the Melissa and Doug set has many more blocks. Apparently there is no ""stanard"" basic unit SIZE when the term ""standard unit blocks"" term is used, which I learned from this experience. Aside from this I am very pleased with the set and would recommend it."
5,Unit Blocks Are Highly Recommended,"We bought these for our toddler two years ago, and he loves them still. Unit blocks are highly recommended by early childhood educators, because they actually help improve children's learning processes. These unit blocks are well loved by both of our children (our toddler is now a pre-schooler and we have a new toddler).The two downsides to this product are the price and the weight. The price is really high for a finished parawood (rubber tree) product, which is a relatively inexpensive wood. Being that these are parawood, which is one of the world's densest woods, the blocks are very heavy. In one way, it is good because they stay put. But in another way, these really hurt if you drop one on your foot or one becomes airborne for some reason.All in all, I recommend these if you can afford them. These make a really good gift, by the way."
2,Count the blocks on the advertisement picture - they have more than 60,"(Postscript below.) The blocks are fairly high quality material. But you're not getting anything like the photo. Count them. Over 60 blocks in photo.And the blocks in the photo (over 60 in description photo) show more large ones than what you get. Most of the blocks are small. When you see that, you're first reaction is dismay.The reason people tend to rate this product well is that kids in fact make nice things out of it. And it's not difficult to clean up. Legos are difficult to pick up after, not this.Kids like this and we should be good sports about it and recognize we were rooked on the price and it doesn't really matter.Postscript 11/20/2012The price went down to 35, a huge discount.11/28/2012Price back up. Price is such a strong signal."
3,good quality - but heavy..,this is a good quality building block set. It would be nice if this set came in some sort of wagon to make it easier to transport.I like that all the pieces fit into the container well and that they don't need to go in any particular order.
4,Big blocks for little hands,"This is a ""full size"" block set. The blocks are solid hardwood, well-cut to match sizes with rounded corners. Good variety of blocks. They only lose a star (should only half a star) because the set is unfinished - you'll probably want to either paint them in colors or put an oil finish on them, and they were not inexpensive to start with."
5,Blocks are never out of style.,"We got these blocks because we had no toys when our grandchildren came to visit. My grandkids, ages 4, and 19 months, love these smooth and sturdy blocks. There are a variety of sizes and shapes .The kids even enjoy putting them away in the wooden box when they are finished playing with them."
2,Not for me,"It's a fine product at a good price if you don't mind that one of the inactive ingredients is propylene glycol. Propylene glycol is the drug Miralax, which is a laxative. It's also used in anti-freeze and many other industrial uses. I have been taking this product for years and recently found out what this ingredient is. Since I have had problems with diarrhea for a long time I immediately stopped taking it. I don't think this supplement caused the diarrhea but it would be nuts to keep taking a product that might be making it worse. And besides, why ingest anything with such a nasty ingredient in it?"
2,Pretty Sad,"I admit I've only played through the first few scenes of this game, but so far everything about it is pretty bad. I have no urge to keep playing to see if it gets better, so I probably won't even bother. The controls are VERY clunky, with ever-changing camera angles and restricted cursor motion that make it difficult to navigate. And so far, the story is lame. I bought it because the box references Monkey Island and the old Sierra games, but I have yet to see any of the humor or intrigue of those games. Oh, and there's nothing special about the graphics or voice acting either.I'm starting to think the adventure game really is dead. I kind of feel bad for The Adventure Company. They're single-handedly trying to keep adventure gaming alive, but they keep churning out really bad games.I give this game two stars instead of one because I've barely played it, and maybe it gets better as it goes. But when I'm bored AND frustrated with a game after the first half hour, that's a pretty bad sign."
4,Good soundtrack guide,"I picked this up at a very low cost at a Hastings book/media store. What a bargain I got! This is the best soundtrack guide I've found. The purchases I've based off this book were both scores I liked but that the book ""highly recommended""-and, yes, these happen to mostly be the best scores I now own. Although like all record guides of late, CDs are now in a renaissance of sorts when it comes to digital restoration, so be aware of this when purchasing. Just shop smart and you'll often get a better copy than what was available at the time this guide went to press. However, the guide will still lead you to the best film/stage version more often than not. Just make sure you get the most recent release(unless the bells and whistles appear overrated-as in added features you have no interest in rather than a pristine newly restored copy-which is the real reason to go for a recent rerelease)."
2,Pointless Drivel,"This book is about as comprehensive as reading the back of a cereal box. Obviuosly, Bernstein is going by memory and not research here. Comprehensive to a point, the book lacks any real nuggets of information and is factually incorrect in many places. For instance, the author states that Larry Monoson, star of The Last American Virgin, was never seen before or since that film. Obviusly, when he rented Friday The Thirteenth: The final chapter and Mask in doing his research, he missed him in both of these films. Huh? Where was he, in the bathroom? Stoned? If you want an interesting voyage into the world of teen cinema, I suggest you go to William Paul's book Laughing Screaming. If you want to waste your money, buy Pretty In Pink."
4,Per amanti cinema anni 80,"Per tutti coloro che hanno la passione per le commedie anni 80, questo libro da tutte le informazione che avreste voluto sapere. Il mondo di quei giorni è descritto benissmo."
3,Lost of fluff not much substance,I was disapointed at how little new knowledge this book contained. Lost of fluff and not much useful substance. I feel not a good value for my money.
1,Its a scam!!!!!,Do not by this item it is one flag there is not a dozen. Who is going to pay $71 for one flag and belt this was supposed to be for an entire team extremely disappointed in Amazon.
1,SET OF 1,"The product was great but I needed 12 to supply a middle school flag football team. The package was delivered on time but with only 1 set, not 12. If you need 12 sets do NOT purchase from this seller! The description of ""12"" or ""dozen"" is false!"
3,Boom Belt,"I was satisfied with the speed of arrival of the order. However, I did have one problem with the product itself. The belt has a smooth side and a ribbed side. The ribbed side is supposed to face out but the way the buckle was manufactured on the belt, the smooth side had to be placed facing out. This was to avoid having the socket facing the wrong way on the belt. So, I was disappointed with the product in that regard but everything else is great!"
3,Flag footbal belts,The suction cup flags work well and are not too easy to pull. They reconnect easy enough. But the thick plastic belts are too stiff and are almost impossible to thread through the buckle in cold weather. A more flexible plastic or other material would be an improvement.
5,Amazing,"Got them, used them and I'm still trying to break them in, but it's a great purchase. They ""pop"" excellently and don't ruin. It's great for a bunch of college kids who are decently strong and don't want to buy cheap velcro flags that rip when pulled a little too hard. I recommend this for anyone wanting to get a game of flag football on."
4,flag football,good product alittle hard to tread the flag holders on belt but real solid sturdy product
1,Flaky and made my system unstable,"Worked well with matching N1 router for about 3 days. Then I had to uninstall/re-install the hardware (tech support recommendation). I did this a few times before exchanging it. Same problem. The PCI card doesn't fit right. The antennae connectors are too loose. Also, I was having to reboot constantly. Once removed, system is more stable. Do not purchase this first version of this adapter card. I will try the USB version when it comes out."
1,Garbage,C. Musselman can add 2 more cards to his connector problem. I have gone through 2 desktop cards that do not have proper fittings for the external antenna - I plan to return it all. Avoid this product.
1,Very Poor,SAVE YOUR MONEY BY NOT PURCHASING THIS DEVICE! DOSENT WORK AS IT MENTIONS IN A DESCRIPTION.TRUST ME AND TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.
2,Dosen't work with Vista,"This item has yet to prove its worth to me. it dosen't work with Windows Vista, even with the new driver from belkin, and it dosen't work that great with xp. I like Belkin and their products. So i'm going to hold on to it, and hope they create a fix for it.UPDATE:with the vista sp1 update and the driver upgrade from belkin that just came out, i have a rocket ship on my hands. the fastest internet times i've ever seen. i love it.it's still hard to keep the antenna plugged into the card. any shift and it will fall off. but other than that, wow. super wow. windows update also has an update for the n1."
1,I had the same problems....,"My dlink router works fine with one wirelessly connected computer using a netgear adapter, but my experience has been like that of others: this belkin adapter flakes on and off - getting a weak or no signal, then full strength, back and forth. I am going to return it."
1,Avoid this product,"I bought this card along with a HP tower with Vista. After following the installation instructions, when the computer should have gone to the new hardware wizard, it instead freaked out and scrambled the screen -- over and over and over again. After after hours on the phone with Belkin I got nowhere. I then put it in my Gateway tower with Home XP. It came right up and works -- but not well. The thing actually interferes with Itunes (yes I know it sounds strange). I'm not playing these songs over the wirelss either, they are on the same tower! The music will slow down in spots and it gets a crackling sound and feedback over the speakers. Turn off the card and it all goes away. Find something else!"
1,Horrible Product All Around,"Horrible product all around. The antenna connector is very poorly designed and has fallen off a couple of times. The drivers are HORRIBLE. About every third reboot, I have to remove the card from within Device Manager and let the driver reinstall itself. The speed is fast, the price was cheap... and it's complete garbage. Recently upgraded to 64 bit... and haven't found any way to get this card to work."
1,"Do NOT buy, EVER!","The worst piece of computer equipment I have ever seen in my life. I am a software developer and worked with computers my whole life. I have never seen a disguisting product like this in my life. Blue screens of death, no native drivers for Vista and up. After wasting a couple of hours, I threw it in the dishwasher, split in half with a hammer then trashed it. Belkin belongs in the trash, not in a store."
1,Crapola,"First the connection between the card and the antenna is a joke. A horrible design that easily disconnects. Second, even with the current Vista drivers, I can't get the think to work. STAY AWAY!"
1,Belkin N1 desktop--don't bother,"Why no negative stars? I purchased this because I had upgraded my wife's old XP machine to a new one w/ Vista and Vista did not recognize the Belkin PreN adapter (its not compatable.) I spoke to Belkin about it and was told the the N1 would work even better than the PreN. Installed it and performance was way worse. Spoke to Belkin and was told to disable firewall, which I did and performance went up a bit but still very poor. So bad that I bought a new Dell that had XP on it and put the PreN adapter in. Performance is at least 3x better. I am selling the new HP computer (really giving it away) to a friend. I am really disapointed with both Belkin for the N1 and the Microsoft for Vista."
1,Complete Garbage,"This product is complete garbage. The antenna connector frequently pops off. I never even get 802.11b speeds from this card, even though the computer is the same room as the Belkin N1 router! My Intel a/b/g laptop card works from anywhere in my apartment with no issues. This card cannot keep a connection for more than a few minutes. The wireless network utility is worthless. It crashes whenever I click the ""check for upgrades"" button (nice touch). The other people were right, if you MUST use this card, use the Windows XP Wireless Zero config and remove the Belkin overlay software.Buy anything else."
4,I love huggies and so does my daughter!,"They are the softest, most comfortable diapers... I use the overnights for the night time, my only complaint would be more of a form fitting waist, I have trouble sometimes fitting her because she is thin. But these have been great, I had problems with some of the other brands, and they fit was never as good as huggies, although they recently redesigned the supremes to make them even better I liked them a little more before, but I am already getting her into the Convertible model now, and those are even better than the regular supreme. I will not put her in standard diapers, only the high end ones, and these are the best! As for the gel bits someone mentions, that only happens when the diaper is left on too long, these are NOT overnight diapers, and when they are full that can happen, you shouldn't go more than 2 hours without changing the diaper - and trust me my daughter has never had a diaper rash from mine, or my husbands care. =)"
5,child seat to hook on table,"Had another seat and we lost it! But we like this one even better. Comes on and off easy. Holds the most weight I've seen. This way you can get more use out of it!!Keeps nice in the car, just folds up very easy too!!"
4,"Great chair, very sturdy but heavy","I like the look of the Inglesina table chair, it is very sturdy, our son is 28 lbs and tries to jump up and down in this seat, never moves, always secure. It is not as light as I would have hoped. We went overseas and I planned on bringing it, but it was too heavy in the end. We take it to relative's/friend's houses but most restaurants in the U.S. have high chairs. In general it is good and it was the most inexpensive one that I could find."
5,Works and Connects Great with Zaurus SL-5500,"It gives a reliable ethernet connection on my Zaurus SL-5500. It is small, and convenient. It is much faster than dialup."
4,It worked,"What can I say, it worked.It takes some time for it to initialize like maybe 1-2 minutes.Some times it will never work unless you re-seat it so its best to re-seat it every time.You need to make sure you computer is running active sync in order for you to install the drivers.With vista you have to go into your control panel and enable the active sync. XP launched the activesync as soon as it detected my pda.Everything else works like any other PDA network device so the menus are all the same.On the software side you don't have to modify any of your code to get this to work."
2,Don't Buy This For A Casio E-200 !!!!,I purchased this for my Casio E-200. I assumed it would work since it was using a CF Slot I type. I tried everything possible but nothing worked. I went to the socketcom.com webpage and there was nothing listed saying it would not. The worst thing is this was the only 10/100 card I found and really wanted it for testing LAN's. Now I either wait for the drivers or purchase a 10mb card instead. One last item is the technical support did reply very quickly in regards to my question on compatibility.
5,tracey schneider,This book provides a wonderful message for any child who has to say goodbye to a family member or close friend. Ms. Chiu captures the emotion of both characters in a beautiful story that is easily understood by both child and parent. The illustrations are a joy to see.
2,"Poor choice for a ""Cavalleria""","After listening to this recording again yesterday. I would like to add my opinion to the others posted here.As the recording began, I started to think-""Hey, this isn't so bad"". As it proceeded, I changed my mind to ""Yes, it is."". This is a well conducted ""Cavalleria"" with great choral and ensemble work. The problem is, no one buys ""Cavalleria"" for the conducting:they want star performances and there are none here. Norman can be downright annoying and her duet with Turridu turns into a screaming match. Not a ""Cavalleria"" to listen to again and again unless you just want to play the choruses."
2,NOT JESSYE'S BEST BY ANY MEANS.,"Jessye Norman is one of my favorite sopranos and i have watched and heard her in some of the greatest roles. But sadly, her Santuzzawas a casting mistake, not to talk about Giacomini's essential lack of beautiful sound. I could not believe my ears for the screechy sound. My absolute favorites in these roles: Callas, Simionato, Troyanos; Bergonzi, Di Stefano, Domingo."
5,Great Book !!,"This is a book that won't end up on the lower shelf of my book case!. It is filled with useful, helpful, basic, down to earth information about building a great web page. The URLs alone are worth the cost of the book. This is an ""interesting"" read, filled with humor! I would highly recommend this book."
2,Too Simple and Out Of Date,"Probably not a bad book for an HTML novice. It uses simple, conversational language - the sort of level of a for Dummies/for Idiots book. For anyone really looking to improve their understanding, I would suggest something like the Oreilly 'Web design in a Nutshell' book, which is excellent. On the design/user interface side, you can't go wrong reading anything by Jakob Nielsen. In addition, any book full of URLs goes out of date fast. I outgrew this book within days, while I keep going back to the others I mentioned. Only go for this book if you need a very non-threatening guide to the basics."
1,Don't believe the other reviewers,"I bought this book based on the other reviews I read. What I got was nothing like they had said, this book is full of OLD techniques and I got nothing from it. For example he talks about making ASCII banners with the Figlet program. Very disappointing."
1,Author Tends to Ramble On Instead of Getting to the Point,I would not recommend this book to serious webmasters. The author rambles on and writes for the sake of writing. Her lack of technical know how on the subject is apparent in her writing. I would prefer a book with a writing style that is concise and to the point and written by an author whose profession is web-related.
3,Jazz influence on cutting-edge modern classical music,"Turnage is definitely one of the greatest living classical composers. In Blood on the Floor, he merges his dark and moody orchestral work with three Jazz soloists, including the legendary John Scofield. The result is definitely not easy listening; rather a disturbing and spooky vision of the dark side of urban life.This is not a piece for the faint-hearted, but sets a high standard for classical music going into the 21st century."
5,They make you successful!,"3x5 index cards are awesome. Honestly, I'm a straight A student, and I believe these cards are part of the result of my success. Yes, you can study without them, but it's a lot easier with 3x5 index cards and you memorize with them faster than on a regular piece of paper."
1,RIPOFF -- BEWARE,Do not * * order this-- I placed an order for '10 packs of 100' and received 1 pack. One! They're $.44 at most thrift stores. Who would pay more than ten times that? Amazon should discontinue this listing immediately and cease doing business with this kind of disreputable vendor.
5,Good Index Cards - not super thick,"These are great normal index cards. They are a little flimsy, but I stick labels on them so it's irrelevant to me. If you are looking for 100% opaque, hard cardstock, go elsewhere."
1,The cards are fine,"The problem is that there are only 100 of them. The listing says describes ""10 pack [sic] of 100"" but all I received was one pack of 100. I just paid five dollars for a hundred cards. This is the product page I bought from:http://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Ruled-Index-Inches-31/dp/B00006IFCX/ref=sr_1_2?rps=1&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1332539066&sr;=8-2"
4,Got to like it,"When I heard samples from this CD, I really wanted to get it. However, when I did and listened the full versions I did not seem to like them that much. There are several pices that I totally do not care for, a few I really like (especially, Bach's pieces), and some I got used to. Overall, I like the CD, but not as much as I though I would."
5,EL GARANTE,"MUY BUEN LIBRO, OJALA ESTE ESCRITOR SIGA ESCRIBIENDO LIBROS COMO ESTE, NO PUEDES PARAR DE LEER HASTA EL FINAL, BUENISIMO!!"
5,"I'd like to be in the ""Louise Simonson Fan Club""",This is an intriguing story of present-time coupled with flashbacks. I've read a lot of Louise Simonson's work and find her to be one of the best in the business. This book is fantastic to read to your kids. The story is exciting and suspenseful.
1,Review From a Future Critic,"I believe that the writer definately could've come up with a better story using the same concept, but that's no excuse to leave your collection incomplete."
1,don't buy from HUAW sports,"Don't buy anything like this lamp from HUAW Sports because they are not shipping anything out, not returning emails and just charging your charge card. BTW, HUAW Sports also owns The Buckeye Connection in Columbus OH on 400 N. High Street! Maybe I can go there and get my lamp in person since they already took my money for it."
1,"I love the show, hate this book","The Simpsons is one of the funniest TV shows ever. It doesn't translate well to paper at all in this book. This is not funny. It reads like some wannabe comedy writer trying to imitate the Simpsons. The book's credits list Matt Groening as the the ""publisher"". It lists 7 writers, none of whom is Groening. It also lists a creative director, art director, and multiple ""contributing artists"", none of whom are Groening. In fact, comparing the list of writers for this book to the list of the show's writers on Wikipedia, none of the show's writers contributed to this book. Maybe that's why it doesn't feel like the show at all. Same characters, lame dialogue, not funny. Too bad."
5,replacement bear,this was a replacement bear for one that broke. Was exactly like the previous one and mended my daughter's broken heart. Very cute toy and I am very pleased with it.
3,Not as good a game as I thought it would be,"My family plays a lot of board games. We also usually like Out of the Box games. We have four children ages 7-15, 2 boys and 2 girls, so I think we have a diverse selection of opinions. This game really did not click with anyone. My seven year-old son was the only one who liked it at all. Generally speaking, it is pretty boring."
2,We Never Really Liked Playing This Game,"We have a big closet full of family games. We've had this one for awhile and yet, it never gets pulled out. Even though we played it a few times, it seemed like more work to play than fun. I'm thinking of quietly removing it so that the kids don't ever think of pulling it out. There are so many better games out there."
4,Saved me time ...,"I've heard a lot of good things about VB Tips & Tricks on the 'Net. After buying this book, I could see why! The information in this book has already saved me time. As a consultant, time means everything"
4,"Very Good for the novice, but [pricey]","Programming and Problem Solving with Delphi is clearly laid out and provides good information for people new to Delphi. As a self-trained programmer migrating from Visual Basic to Delphi I found it quite useful, but I question its value to experienced Delphi campaigners. I also cannot work out why it's so [pricey]."
3,Sincere stamina,"3 1/2Harper's third had a will to live of its own; despite some predictability the organic passion throughout is palpable, augmenting more generic structure with soul power."
5,"Ben is a young, modern-day magical music hero - poignant",Ben's emotion and trust of his craft and talent make his music a joy to listen to. He has the love and soul of a 100 year old delta blues singer and the freshness of a current pop icon.You will love this album.
4,a good study of pulp magazines,"Written by Robert Sampson, this book is a study on a number of known(and not so known)pulp magazines and the heroes that dwelled within. If you feel hesitant to start reading Sampson's longer pulp magazine study(the ""Yesterday's Faces""series), then this might be thebook for you."
5,Magnificent music from a magnificent singer,"Anything Jessye does is wonderful, but this CD of her Christmas concert at Notre Dame is superlative. During the concert there wasn't enough room inside the cathedral for everyone who wanted to attend her concert, so the crowd spilled out into the streets of Paris, with large screens set up for the people outside to watch the concert.The opening Jubilate Fanfare is triumphant, as is the closing Sanctus, and everything in between is a mix between classical (the Agnus Dei), traditional (Behold that Star, Star of Wonder), and spiritual (Rockin' for the World, Go Tell it on the Mountain). A wonderful Christmas CD for listening or for background music while opening presents and visiting with friends."
3,A valuable second choice,"This performance of Die Fledermaus is no doubt beautifully performed, especially Fassbaenders aria is a jewel. However, the atmosphere is somehow cool and artificial, Te Kanawa and Gruberova have difficulties with the operetta setting of the plot. Previn does not serve the ""champagne"", his conducting is somehow a little too operatic. If you like to have a second version of the ""bat"" in your collection, choose this one or the live performance of the Vienna Volksoper in Japan (Denon). If you only need one version, the choice second to none is the Carlos Kleiber version with Varady / Prey - even if it was only for the quality of the orchestral interpretation (although assigning the role of the prince to a basso singing falsetto - Ivan Rebroff - is a question of taste)."
5,This bat can fly!,"This is a collection of highlights, not the entire operetta. The first five reviews I've read had mixed reactions, but all seemed pleased with this performance.I found Edita Gruberova's Adele superlative. Just to hear her sing ""Spiel' ich die Unschuld vom Lande,"" is worth the price of the CD. In the ""Laughing Song"" (Mein Herr Marquis), she smoothly, yet precisely, sings each note, unlike so many sopranos who seem to bark the laughs. Only Janet Perry approaches Gruberova in the quality of singing in this role.For me, Kiri Te Kanawa practically owns the role of Rosalinde. Few can equal her in any of the arias. You'll believe she's really Hungarian.Overall, I think you'll find this a beautifully-performed, spirited Fledermaus, where all the performers seem to be having a very good time."
5,Quand on voudrait qu'elle vous dise je t'aime,"J'ai eu la chance un soir d'entendre la chanson ""Le premier pas"" dans un karaoke, et je fus submergé d'émotions. Ce premier pas j'attends qu'elle le fasse. Claude-Michel parle à la place de tous les coeurs amoureux. Merci Claude-Michel"
4,"Nice, but","As mentioned is several other reviews, this product does warp. In the case of the one I received, it came that way-I did not have to put it through the dishwasher to have it happen. That said, it did work fine on my quartz counters and was just the size I was looking for. It fit in the top rack of my dishwasher (this is where it should go if you don't want the heat to warp it further). For the price I would probably buy this again."
3,"""Cute Board"" BUT - knife marks are left quite easily.","I purchased this board for a good friend of mine as a ""just because"" gift. She thought it was really ""cute"" and was going to use it as her most used board because she was also drawn to the non-slip idea with it. She used it one time and it already showed the scarring marks from the knife used. She still likes the board but it won't be her favorite board.I haven't tried the board myself so I can't really comment much more than what she mentioned to me (in passing) about it. She does think its a great idea but that something needs to be done about the ""scarring effect"".She does have Farberware boards that she uses constantly and they don't scar such as this one did. The suction feet worked quite well but the Farberware boards have some sort of non skid type thing on them as well so the trade off tilts slightly to Farberware."
1,cheap chinese board,"I bought 2 of these for 4 for 3 promotional items...boards are horrible..they warp after wash in diswasher,and lot of cut marks..I also have the smaller one but that is good.Planning to return them lets see if amazon refunds the money."
5,Perfect sized cutting board - wish I had another one just like it,"Yes, it is a little convex in the middle (barely visible - it came that way). But, it stays put on the counter, and I love the heftiness of the board. It doesn't have a handle - like the one in the picture - but I think that's a waste anyway and totally useless. Stuff usually falls through the handle opening onto the counter."
1,More Made in China junk,"This cutting board is what is says it is, a small cutting board with a rubber bottom. But, keep in mind that it is Made In China, which to me means don't cut up food on it, who knows what chemicals are used to make up the plastic. I would rather pay an additional three or four dollars and have it made somewhere that has standards, and I know the product is safe."
3,"OK Cutting Board, but picture is misleading","This cutting board does NOT have the handle cut-out shown in the picture (it's a solid, flat board). Other than that, it's OK. Also note that 8-by-11 is a bit on the small side for a cutting board."
1,Software no longer supported,"This tutorial may have been state-of-the-art in its day, but it doesn't recognize newer versions of QuickTime, and my attempts to install the QT version on the CD just brought up an ""illegal operation"" box. After struggling for a whole day at my computer, I was finally able to view the movie clips by downloading an older version, QT 5.0, but the SignLinks tutorial feature still does not work.(...)"
1,: \,Doesn't work. You can hear the audio but can't see the video! Please do not purchase this product if you value your hard earned money!
1,Great Marketing for a Threadbare Product,"The first couple of reviews are most apt.Bad product, poor implementation.It's cheap for a reason."
1,Watch out not compatible,I saw nothing on the advertisement from Amazon that this software was old and not compatible with XP. Needless to say I wasted my money because I tried to install it and it bombed out. Amazon's policy is media must be returned unused or unopened. XP has been out for a long time and I don't know how someone can get away with selling old outdated software. I might not buy any software from third parties like Amazon again. I would rather just go to the store so I can check out the packaging and take it back if it does not work. Or I may buy direct from the makers of the software that will tell you any compatibility problems.
1,BOOO,I did not like this product it wouldn't load on any computer I tried it on. They were all new computers of mine and my friends. So I give this asl teaching cds 1 star because I can't go any lower
3,There is a newer edition!,"Part of the reason for the declining reviews for this product is the fact that it is aging.While the ASL Deluxe product is probably the way to go, there is a new 5 CD ROM ASL edition out from TOPICS too at about the same (or lower) price as this old one, called TOPICS ENTERTAINMENT Total Immersion American Sign Language 2.0 ( Windows ) here on Amazon.There is also a new basic 2 CD ROM package with selected new content.The new versions have a dark-haired woman on the box.It's confusing because they have called this outdated product 2.0 as well.Check out the new edition(s) before making your decision!"
1,What???,"Ok, I guess my main problem is that I have windows xp and only one of the four programs actually works with windows xp, the others I don't know what's going on with them. The one that does work isn't set up in a learning manner at all. It's more like a dictionary, in fact what I could see from all of them none of them are set up in a learn sign language type way, they're more like here's sign language see what you can remember. I feel like I've wasted time and money on this and it fell short, very short of my expectations which were low to start."
5,My Second Rolex,I have owned a previous Rolex (smaller model) and have enjoyed the dual time function on this model. Super quality and dependability. Love the watch!
5,Madigan's Wife,"This book was so good I couldn't put it down. After I finished I found out it was part of a series "" The Sinclair Connection"". Seven books so far that I see. Linda Winstead Jones your the best. Can't wait to read the rest of this series."
5,Excellent romance!,I read all Linda Winstead Jones books because her characters are strong. She's a sure bet! This one is no exception. You can't put this one down.
5,professional quality,"I've worked in horticulture for half my life and used Solo's professional backpack sprayers. We've closed our nursery and I needed a new sprayer when the one I kept finally failed. This is a smaller unit, more in scale with my current needs and the quality is excellent."
2,"Faulty design, dangerous","I've been using two other Solo sprayers for years, the 4 gallon backpack sprayer and the 2 liter sprayer. I've been very happy with both of those, but am very disappointed with the 2 gallon sprayer. The pump/handle part seems especially badly designed. You pump to pressurize, then push the handle down and lock it in place to pick up and carry the unit. This locking part is plastic, and I found it very difficult to lock into place. Much worse than that though, when I had to stop spraying and pump to re-pressurize, the locking part stuck, so when I twisted to release the handle, it actually opened the whole unit, which de-pressurized and blew the chemical up in my face. Very disappointing for a Solo sprayer. I'm going to look into my options for returning it."
1,Impossible to Clean,"My company ordered two of these sprayers to treat weeds, and cannot get the red lid off to clean the container. We have called a few dealers and used WD-40 to try to get the lids off, but to no avail. We will be returning all sprayers to the dealer."
1,poor design and dangerous,"I bought the sprayer about a monath ago. Since then I have used the sprayer three times. After each use the sprayer was difficult to clean The only way to clean the tank was to allow the contents to clear from the sprayer to remove the pressure. After this I could only clean it by removing the pump. If I was not sure the pressure was completely out of the sprayer when I unscrewed the top, any ramaining contents could spray into my face. This did happen to me.On the third use the connector between the pump handle and the tank pump broke rendering the sprayer useless. In my opinion the connector is of poor design and made of cheap plastic.I would not recommend this sprayer to anyone."
1,Missing Lid to Sugar Bowl,"The sugar bowl itself is very pretty, however, it took over three months to arrive. Then, when I finally received it, it was supposed to come with a lid and I never received that with the bowl. I made Amazon aware of this and they immediately shipped out a replacement, however, that one came WITHOUT the lid as well. From that point on, they were unable to assure me that I could get the correct item. I returned my order and have decided to give up on trying to get the correct item. Very unfortunate!"
1,very very po'ed,"Ordered a ""dozen"" flag-a-tag sonic boom flags from Warehouse Deals,Inc,thru Amazon only received one measley flag.It says a dozen on item description.I am very infuriated right now.I do not recomend these guys.Id give them no stars,but apparently you have to."
5,A worthy reissue,"The marketing folks over at Sub Pop sure know what they are doing. What better way to get more cash out of aging Gen-Xers than to reissue the classic albums of our wasted youth? But, this one is worth it because this has been impossible to get for a long time. Now, cheaper than it originally cost is this deluxe edition of a fantastic album. You get a nice booklet and artwork (something downloads can't provide) plus a seond disc of bonus material. It's likely that if you're looking at this then you are already a RRM fan. If you got burned on the Diary or Superfuzz re-issues (they're pretty weak), don't worry - go ahead and buy this reissue you won't be disappointed."
2,Not a Jodorowsky film...,"Well, it is a Jodorowsky film in name, but.... it's certainly not what his fans might expect. Tame beyond belief. I think Alejandro was neutered before filming began."
1,Basic and Incomplete,"This book only contains 4 sections with problems and explanations: Arithmetic, Algebra, Word Problems, and Graphs. The problems are basic and are not for college math majors. I have taken practice GRE tests and this book fails to include anything past algebra 1. It's missing calculus and beyond (basically most of the test). Not recommended unless you need help with your high school math homework.1 star for basically being a waste of money to me and not helping me with the GRE."
4,Nice but kill my little toes!,"I like the look of these shoes and hoped the square front would not pinch my toes, but unfortunately this is not the case. I like the height and feel of the shoes, but everytime I wear them my little toes blister very badly. I keep hoping they will stretch but it hasn't happened so far. I wear them once every couple weeks hoping they eventually will."
4,Sweet Emotions,"Im always looking for a CD to fill the holes in my collection of over a 1000 classical cds, how I let this gem slip through is beyond me. With only a few reviews I was a bit leary but I bought it anyway. I was immediately drawn in by the emotion of this piece, it runs the gamit. I don't have comparison recording of it but it certainly captured my attention.When I was finished listening I ran it again and even better, this will stay in my cd player for a while. My beloved Rachmaninoff never ceases to amaze me. The recording was not bad, I'd never heard of the label, but for the used price I hardly would complain. I'd like to see this piece get some exposure in Gramophone. Buy this music if you like raw emotion in your music, it isn't pretty, but it must be heard by classical fans."
5,Fantastic!,"Hooray for Tavros Records! They have given us a thoughtful, inspired rendering of two beautiful Rachmaninoff piano trios. Performances are incredible! Many thanks. Hope a lot of folks find this rare jewel."
2,Horrible,"The person below says they know more about planes and ""might even be able to fly one someday"" Well, I am a pilot and if they think these planes are realistic, then I would be scared to board a plane that they are piloting. I thought this game would be fun, but it was so unrealistic it was annoying. This game acts like flying is as simple as moving a joystick back and forth. There are no ailerons, banking, yawing, etc. I give this a negative ten!! If you are looking for a realistic fun flying game, I recommend any of the newer Flight Simulator X games from Microsoft. Besides professional flight sims that we use that cost a minimum of $800-1,500, the 50 dollar one made by microsoft is one of the best. But, DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS GAME!!"
2,Odd,"Seems like a very amateurish production. I'm still confused as to how to use the materials. The CD is almost worthless (it's filled with stories, but doesn't teach you the basics of pronunciation).This product is a shame because it appears to be one of the only audio Latin programs available. I'm going to renew my search though."
2,Bad art and light plot!,Cassandra Cain was an interesting character when she first showed up in Batman: No Man's Land. Her character had a ton of possibilities but as with most DC characters she was made too powerful. We witness that here as she finally has her showdown with Shiva. I do like the budding friendship with Spoiler as I think it works much better than with Barbara. The art is at times almost indecipherable. I understand that its stylized but during certain scenes its hard to tell what's going on. Overall this is an average book that could have been much better!
4,what is this?,"true, like most SDRE fans, i was a little more than excited when i heard jeremy enigk was doing a solo album. then, for some reason it slipped my mind until about a year ago. any rate, i finally managed to pick this disc up and was left wondering. what had jeremy managed to do? he did a complete 180 from his role in the crunchy, guitar-driven place in sunny day to play with an orchestra? what the heck is this? i put the disc away, content not to listen to it, and mildly upset for spending twelve bucks. a few days ago, i pulled it out again and low and behold, i could stand the album. definitely not a first listen record, but a good cd, nonetheless. for those of you expecting this to sound ANYTHING like a sunny day real estate record, brace yourself. it is completely new territory for this extraordianry artist. if you prefer thump-you-over-the-head guitars, don't buy it. if you have a soul, i might just recommend picking this one up."
3,(3 1/2) Enter the Frog Queen,"I havent been listening alot to Sunny Day Real Estate before I bought this CD. So LP2 is my only CD by SDRE so I don't have much to compare styles too. All I know is that this is a very unique and trippy CD to listen too. It has beautiful harmonies, strange lyrics, haunting vocals that scream and whisper with subtle change and vigor. Its truly like nothing else in your CD Collection. My fav song is Explain. Jeremy Enigk is surely one of my generations gifted musical artists, I hope to hear more work from him (since SUnny day broke up again) I just wish more people could appreciate this kind of music.Other great Singer/Songwriters to check out.Dashboard Confessionals&Aaron Sprinkle"
2,Disappointing... lacked momentum,"I've enjoyed Stella Cameron's other 7 Mayfair books, but this one didn't do it for me. I found it slow and unexciting, and never got into the characters. The characters didn't seem to develop in any way, and the plot twist didn't grab me.I almost never get rid of books from my favorite authors, but I sold this one as soon as I finished the book."
5,Adam and Desiree with melt your heart!,"About Adam is a wonderful story. When I started reading it, I kept saying to myself, poor, poor Adam. Adam Chillworth is a painter, a deep, brooding man who is in love with a woman that he can never have. Princess Desiree is a young woman who can never have the man she loves so very much. No worries, though. Just as there are forces trying to drive them apart, there are forces pushing them together. Adam is an honorable man, one who thinks to protect Desiree, if if from himself, as he feels he is not good enough for her. This is a story of drama, passion and intrigue, done in such a manner to keep the pages turning very quickly. Let's not forget about the humor! About Adam is the next in the Mayfair Square series. I'd say pick them all up, as you will not regret it. Robin Taylor"
2,Boring and Not Worth It,"After reading the other books in the Mayfair 7 series, I expected this book the be good and edge-gripping. It turned out to be incredible boring. The characters didn't have a set personality and came off as shallow. I thought it was kind of like a movie with bad actors, you couldn't bring the characters to life. There was very little plot. They got together near the beginning, so there was no suspense. The writing was very choppy and made little sense. I wanted to stop reading the book and just burn it. I was very disappointed with her work."
4,Another Mayfair Square classic,This book is another in the series of Mayfair Square books. In this one Adam and Desiree FINALLY have their romance. It is not a book that will make you think but their love is true and I loved hearing their story after so much previous build-up in the previous Mayfair Square books. It was a sweet book with a lot of sub-plot. I definitely recommend it- but you might want to start with the earlier books so you can get the backstory.
1,Disappointing End,"I enjoyed all the previous Mayfair Square books but this one was a big disappointment. I agree with other reviewers that the writing was choppy and difficult to follow. There were several errors: Jenny McBride turned into Jenny O'Brien; Evans the under-butler who aided the villain in the previous book, is back at 7 Mayfair Square - very unlikely!"
3,A bit dissapointed,"I would have liked to have him perform his older songs, but if you don't mind all his broadway performances and only, at the end, a medley of Mandy, etc., then the tape is OK."
1,A package of old broken junk,"Hi,This product is horribly misrepresented on the site. Out of the four discs, one is the Visual Dictionary, which is an ancient piece of software created in 1996. Suffice it to say that I could not use it because it insisted that my CD-ROM should be the D: drive. (I have several hard drives, so this is not an option.)Discs 3 and 4 are an encyclopedia whose creator has gone out of business, as the technical support contact enclosed in the package confirmed. Therefore, one cannot register the product or gain access to some of the features. This makes it fairly pointless, as I hope anyone would agree.The only really working part of the package is Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus, the 1999 edition."
2,"Tedious, No Photos","Written about ten years before his sex change operation, this disappointing book is suprsingly dry and tedious. Thankfully, the author does express some definite opinions however many of the cities visited were not interesting. I gave up about half way through."
3,"The Everything Kids' Soccer Book: Rules, Techniques, & more","This book was good. The format was easy to read. Each section could have been longer.I wish defense was covered as well as offense. Ace, age 11"
4,"Has alot of information, but not enough to capture an 8 year old",I bought this for my 8 year old and even looked over it myself. It has alot of info but she didn't seem too interested. Maybe she just doesn't like to read - but she did it one day and hasn't touched it in a year. I never wrote my reviews - it's been a year and the book looks like brand new . . . should have saved my money - but is a good source of learning for kids who actually LIKE to read! LOL
5,Explaning how Harry Potters fly - different way!,I was interested to learn more about the ways witches fly after I read Harry Potter books. This is an INTERESTING piece! It reads very interestingly and very strange! Do people practice this?Enjoy the book!
1,Heed my warning,Please don't try this. Belladonna (one of many herbs) is very poisonous and dangerous. Leave the brewing to the real witches. I wish this book was in a private library due to its deadly content.
3,Free me from Skype,It works. It would be nice if I could find some sort of firmware update to free it from its Skypization; it works fine with a regular Win32 SIP client as both audio devices. Open standards exist; it would be nice if hardware manufacturers would build hardware to support them.
3,Annual ornament,This is a beautiful ornament but it doesn't really say 2006 on it. There is a tiny little tag at the top that says it and that's it. I thought it said it on the back.
1,Not A Peak Reading Experience,"The author clearly does not know anything about mysticism except as an intellectual concept. He seems to think a holiday qualifies as a mystical experience and goes on and on about boredom and your ""personal best"". None of the poets he chooses to write about are considered to be mystics. His essays are too literary and make somewhat eccentric but uninteresting arguments. This book induces the very boredom he is complaining about."
5,review,"This is a cute video teaching all about the FSU Seminoles colors, mascot, traditions, etc... baby brainwashing at its best! Go Noles!"
5,Overwhelming!,"This author has never let me down! This tome is a journey filledwith the overwhelming beauty, passion, and incredable vastness of theemotions of God and man. You will read it again & again!John G."
4,"Superbly written, very perceptive.","The best-written and most accurate biography of the Empress-dowager Tz'u-hsi. Although Marina Warner never studied Chinese, her account almost always tallies with the vernacular sources. She offers a shrewd, plausible and perceptive analysis of Tz'u-hsi's character. Her appraisal of the period has more insight and balance than Sterling Seagrave's jaundiced politically correct approach. An excellent introduction to the late Ch'ing dynasty."
4,Very informative,"I was doing my report my Tz'u Hsi and this book has a lot of information, probably more information than people need. Half of the time, it tells about war and China's situation at the time instead of Tz'u Hsi herself. For me I'm very interested in Chinese history and this book really satiated my thirst for it. This book can be a bit boring at times, but for the most part, it's interesting. It gives people an insight about chinese traditions and of course, the empress dowager herself. I recommend reading it!"
2,"Appreicated the effort, however......","I certainly appreciate the effort that Mr Victory and the Deputation has taken to right the judicial wrongs in the Guildford and Maguire cases.However Mr Victory's method of expressing the compilation of the facts of the two cases forced me to stop reading at page 92. I simply could not finish the remaining 300 pages of the book knowing that I would be subjected to reading and re-reading and re-reading and re-reading the facts without any forward motion or leading to any conclusion.It is stated on the back cover; ""....... This is his first book"". A true and obvious statement.I would suggest researching other titles for those seeking to learn of these two tragic mis-carriages of justice."
4,goord shtuffs,"pretty good set of earphones. the silicone heads are extremely comfortable and its nice to be able to swap in the different sets. i primarily use this for my ipod and nintendo ds, so it works well with that. i wouldn't recommend these if you're looking for use as a primary sound device (i.e. for computer gaming, extensive music). my only complaint is that the sound is slightly muffled at lower volumes. however, higher volume produces clear sound with a surprising amount of bass."
1,I can't get it to work!,"Well, I have many problems with this stupid little device. First off is the lame instructions. Also, I've downloaded songs onto the player itself, but it won't play them! The screen shows I have 64 minutes of runtime on there, but it won't play! So then I try to see what's wrong with it, but when I connect it to my computer, Windows Media Player shows that no device is present. I played one song on the stupid thing the whole year I have owned it. If you have any advice for me please email me at GoodmanJazzFan@aol.com"
1,don't buy this product!,mac drivers and software do not work. will crash your system. avoid this product at all costs!
3,Starting fresh,I found that I had a problem with the headphone jack also. I was able to use it for a few days and was happy. I have never owned an MP3 player befor. It installed into my windows machine in XP with no problems. I haven't been able to figure out the mac software yet. I need to spend more time with it. I exchanged it and I am going to see if the headphone problem is fixed on the new one.
3,It didn't work!,"this may have been a fluke but I had to return mine to Circuit City--the front panel would not work. However its a good price, so I'm going to buy another one and see if I have better luck."
4,Excellent Product,"This is my first mp3 player. This mp3 player is definitely a good buy if you are looking for a cheap player with above-average playability. After looking at all the other reviews, yes this player isn't exactly the best, but for [the price] (I got it at sears for only 74.99) it is definitely worth every bit of your money. One major flaw to the product is the manual. The manual is very horribly done (Telling you to click next aren't instructions), Emiglobal might as well not have included a manual and saved some trees."

4,is it a fake?,nice guide to help you spot the fake items. handy carry size to take with you to the flea market.
4,Good reference,"This book was a good reference for the beginner to start, but it was still confusing at times. It could have been made clearer as to what to look for when spotting fakes."
5,"Cheap now, More later",This toy is great because he is only 6 dolalrs now but in a few years the value of this toy will increase like series 1-10 figures. Buy now while they are cheap!
5,YES,"This CD just keeps growing on you. When I first got it(on the strength of one song I ordered both this and ""The Early Year"")I thought ""HMMMM...what have I spent my money on."" After about a week I just couldn't live without it. This is one of the best CDs that I own...and I own a LOT.Just buy it and see."
3,No Depression? Yes Depression!,"Scud Mountain Boys make husky, downbeat alt country, with predictably heartfelt lyrics and surprisingly breathy vocals. The album definitely harks back to the laid back country-softrock of the seventies. Not horrible, but not exactly exciting. Standout is `Cigarette Sandwich"" which is the only song on the album that varies the mood or the sound, however minimally. A bit of a yawn, really. I'd stick with the Jayhawks."
3,The lyrics are great. The songwriting is so-so.,"If ""Scud Mountain Boys"" were able to come up with songs as catchy as their lyrics are powerful, they'd be superstars. As it is, ""Massachutsetts,"" which is mostly accoustic, has a lot to say, but doesn't say it with the type of emlody that keeps you coming back for repeated listenings. The music evokes a lonely and wasted feeling that is definately anti-Nashville in its spirit. Overall, this is an eccletic album that will be loved by its admirers but probably ignored by everyone else."
1,Bait and Switch,"This was the product ordered, but I received an entirely different Octopus. Ozbo called the supplier and they said they couldn't pick out the color. It wasn't just another color, it was a different toy! Ozbo said they'd remove it from their website and would not charge me for the toy. I found it elsewhere. Beware of Great China!"
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to Sactuary, and I was somewhat disappointed when I finished it. ML takes the first 150 pages (of a 280 page novel) to get to the final chapter of Alta. The last 130 pages are a glossing-over of the details, plans, and events that lead to the final confrontation between the Magi and the Jousters. ""Confrontation"" is a bit of a strong word for the 45-second hand-to-hand combat between Kiron and the single Magi who is operating the Eye. And then things just fall down. And it's over. I'm left wondering if Ms. Lackey isn't too concerned about quantity and not nearly concerned enough about quality. I hope her next novel doesn't disappoint half as much as this one did."
3,A mediocre ending to a spectacular beginning,"While I really enjoyed the first two books in this series, the third one fizzled for me. Potential conflicts that could have made the story more interesting were avoided altogether. Former enemies work together in Sanctuary with no dissention, the male hero maturely avoids any misstep in seeking romance with the woman he loves, and dragons overcome the impossible and learn new tricks to save the day. Everything works out for the heroes in a very straightforward plotline that lacks any surprises or character development.I think it's worth buying in paperback form to finish out the series, it's just not the same caliber as I'm used to reading from this author."
3,A quick read,"I've enjoyed most of Mercedes Lackey's books, and while I enjoyed this one very much, it was not one of her best outings.I always pictured Ari as a soldier and a leader of a small group of men under his command, not the leader of many hundreds hiding out in the desert so when he was ""chosen"" to be the King of Sanctuary, I didn't much buy into that.My other real issue with the book concerns the encounter between Kiron and his love interest. Characters are supposed to grow and evolve as the story unfolds and I did not imagine Kiron giving into her demands as quickly as he did; it's as if he completely reverted back to the serf he was when the series started.There was not as much detail in this one as there had been in the previous two; it was almost as if we were expected to have read the other two prior to reading this one."
3,Not the best,The first several chapters seem to be rehashing the previous novels and then the most of the rest of the book is about the building of sanctuary. With all that build up the ending is somewhat anti-climatic and rather a dissapointment. It almost seemed accidental in the end and not my favorite book by this excellent author.
4,For My Love of Dragons,"I enjoyed the first & second book, J Sanctuary (2005) is the third Fantasy novel in the Dragon Jousters series. If you enjoyed Anne McCaffrey's novels of Pern , and for any who loves dragons, this is a must read series.Sanctuary did not come up to the standards of the first two.. Joust, the first book in the series, was all I could hope for as was the second. However, I think Sanctuary is a must read to explain the ending of the first two."
3,Weaker Than Alta....,"There's a danger in a series that once you become committed to it that the story line will begin to weaken. That unfortunately happens to some degree in Sanctuary.If you started with Joust and Alta and enjoyed them, you will want to know how the story continues. I imagine it would be disconcerting to jump right into book 3.The development of Kiron/Vetch continues and he moves from the leader of a small corp of dragon riders into a powerful man of his own in the new city of Sanctuary, which is beginning to see the crumbling of both Tia and its enemy Alta, due to the rotten leadership at their cores.Sanctuary is being composed of refugees of both cities. The culture develops and grows as Kiron grows.The book isn't bad, just a bit formulaic -- though it does have all the elements of Mercedes' wirting that I enjoy -- but I have read better. It kept my interest enough to read the sequel, so start with Joust, move to Alta, and if you enjoyed them both pick up Sanctuary."
3,Hurried ending,"Mercedes Lackey joust series is like the rest of her books GREAT. There is no better author, for one to sit down relax and unwind then with her books.I enjoyed the first two joust books and with much enthusium awaited the final chapter, but it felt hurried. As if she just felt the need to finish it and wasn't sure where to go.The joust books are about dragon jousters knights who fight on the back of dragons. Most jousters use wild the dragons drugged into submission, but one group has decided to raise the dragons from hatchlings and to bond with them. This makes them suberb fighters.Instead of using their dragons to fight the Tians, they find that they are in danger from within their own country and must flee.The third book is how they beat the enemy from within and how they make peace between two enemies."
4,Soar with Dragons,"As usual Mercedes Lackey keeps the reader wanting more. In Sanctuary people of different races, religions and beliefs come together, with the help of dragons that have been trained by kindness and love, to stop a war that has been going on for generations."
4,Enjoyable,"I liked finding out more about the characters and the romances. It had some slow parts but ultimately, they were necessary to move the plot along"
5,love at first sight,This is my favorite picture in the world and it was definitely a great value. It arrived on time and in great condition.
3,Manual OK...Software Bad!,"The manual was what it was, a manual.It did a good job explaining the ins and outs of the software.The problem was the software that it was explaining.The software is old, out of date and hard to use.Not the fault of the manual."
5,FrontPage 2003,The FrontPage 2003 (The Missing Manual) was really the 'missing manual' needed for improving my own webpage. Warmly recommend it to any FrontPage user.
4,Almost perfect in its content,"Instructional manuals lack the one-to-one human connection that make learning more interactive. As complete as this manual strives to be--and it's very good--it can't take the place of individual instruction from a knowledgeable, experienced professional. Case in point are the directions for creating a navigation menu: follow them to a ""T"" and encounter a surprise when the outcome doesn't match what's listed in the manual.It takes some savvy to blend one's own personal knowledge and intelligence with that of a great instructional manual. If you're really a beginner, opt for a class first, then use this manual as your constant companion."
5,Valuable source of information,"The readability of this book is outstanding, and it facilitates the understading of what a website is, and the tools with-in Front Page which will help in the creation a basic website. After reading the first few pages of Front Page 2003 I felt confident that I had found the proper manual to assist me in developing, and eventually publishing my website. Unequivically, I highly reccomend this manual as the primary resource for utilizing Front Page 2003."
5,the one for me,"I got FrontPage 2003(The Missing Manual) it is good from the start to the end, I knew quite a lot already because I used FrontPage for more than a year already but no book to help me in my study, I also use macromedia dreammweaver which is quite good too I use the best of both world building a wesite from both what a cannot do with one I do with the Other one I make use of the FrontPage for dynamic pages for I'm not very good at coding FrontPage does the hard work for you and save you months of hard and tedious coding and headaches."
1,A waste of money.,"There is very little useful information in this book jam-packed with data. It includes highly debatable physical descriptions of the actors, their aliases, and the names and dates of their films. No plot summaries, no descriptions of their abilities or proclivities, or the relative quality of the films. There isn't even any cross-reference to find out if the actor or actress appeared with another particular actor/actress. Lame."
4,"Heart model - good likeness, a little fragile",I like the heart. It is anatomically correct. I am disappointed that the valves are inexpensive additional parts and come detatched easily.
5,Heartbreaker,"I bought this not for the educational value, although I am sure it brings much educational value, but as a gift to someone I courting. You know, the whole ""my heart is in your hands"" thing? Well, it worked.Be careful what you wish for."
4,Sexy Beast,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered this book. It's the first time I've ever read an ""XXXX-rated"" novel, very HOT! Maybe not good reading for folks with prudent sexual ideas. The authors explore unbidden relams many of us might only fantasized about but never carry out. I'll admit the stories are VERY different they tell of men (and sometimes women) who are shapeshifters (or have ability to be both animal or human), they are unbridled in their sexual prowress and have no inhibitations whatsoever. If the reader allows their self to emerge with the written word and visualize what the authors are saying . . . then yes, you CAN get hot and bothered by this book. If you want to have a mental journey on the WILD side then try reading one of these books . . . very sexually explicit"
2,Confusing; Chaotic,"I think it would have helped me if I had had a strong interest in the period of time the story took place (Middle Ages?). It was a physically unattractive movie, and the plot seemed chaotic. Also, I had bought the movie because of my interest in the young actress, Natalie Morse, but she spent most of the movie in an underground cave. I don't recommend this film."
4,Each scene framed like a renaissance graphite drawing.,"In the oppressive atmosphere of the medieval times where midwives and herbalists were considered in league with the devil, one witnesses the transcendental journey of a young, spirited, and spiritual woman as she explores the feminine aspects of God, with Mary as her inspiration. The naturalistic concepts within the exploration of the feminine (Earth/Mother ideology) may offend some fundamentalists, but I interpret this as metaphorical. This film is worth seeing for the cinematography alone. It's unspeakably beautiful, shot in black and white, each scene framed like a renaissance graphite drawing."
3,too small for a toddler,"I ordered tangerine/grey, but for some reason received brown and green. This blanket is small. It's not ideal for a toddler, but probably just fine for a small baby. It is also thinner than I expected. However, I do like that one side is waterproof and the other side is soft."
2,well written but wildly wrong in capturing the Hartnell era.,"In concept and partial execution, a good book. The last hundred pages are particularly well done. Unfortunately, at least the first 50 to 100 pages are wasted with a bizarre obsession with pedophilia. It moves the plot no where and is obviously not true to the Hartnell era. It is also disturbing that such a thing could be in a Doctor Who novel period. Also, since the book is not intended for younger readers, some type of warning should have been indicated on the cover. Since pedophilia is a vile practice, the book is then foisted with the baggage such a ghastly subject would entail. If homosexuality must be dragged into a Doctor Who book, I would suggest THE EMPIRE OF GLASS as a template. But, I don't see how pedophilia can ever be handled in a non evil way. Strange. Unfortunate."
3,TomTom Car Charger,"What I ordered and what I got were not the same thing. The product didn't match the picture. But, the buyer kindly sent me the correct item at no cost. As a consumer who has now gone to her third replacement cord. Don't leave it plugged into the GPS all the time. Charge only when necessary. The attachment head has fallen apart each time."
1,TomTom Car Charger for Go Navigators,"This product is advertised as if it will fit every GO Navigator out there. I had to return mine because it was not compatible with my 700 GO. However, I must compliment Amazon on how they handled my return. They sent me an email with a return postage pick up and instructions on how to return it at their expense. I received a full credit to my credit card account. From now on, I will have no hesitation to order from Amazon because of their customer sensitivity and service."
5,Impressed with sound quality!,I bought these for my husband for his landmark birthday. He was delighted! I was extremely impressed with the sound quality. I have played them on a number of different devices and they make even the worse CD player sound good. Even the storage box is nicely made.
5,Fantastic Tunes,Enjoyed this set most of all. I had not heard this music for many years. what a Joy to hear these songs again.
2,Malt Shop Momories,"This collection is nothing new. The same mix has been available in many collection for a long time. Please show me something different. Same old, same old, how sad. There are hundreds if not thousands of songs from that era, but this collection includes the same songs that have been included in every record/cd set produced in the last 30 years."
3,"hilarious, but very short","I love Baloo cartoons, and I see them frequently in different places. So, I was really looking forward to having a collection of them. Unfortunately, this book only has two cartoons per page, and only on pages 7-62. This means there are less than 120 cartoons in this book. I read through the book while waiting for a family member to finish primping before going out. I have no idea how many Baloo cartoons are in existence, but it must be far more than are published here. This book is not even close to a definitive collection. I hope the artist produces something more comprehensive in the future."
3,"Decent, but buggy","I'm glad to see that a few folks got enjoyment out of this package. The GPS 10 unit itself is great. The software, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. You can't install the software completely to removeable storage, you can't use any other GPS with the package (only the GPS 10 will connect), and the installation is long and tedious. For additional info search Google for GPS 10 review."
1,"Two Units, Both Failed","I bought a brand new unit directly from Garmin. It worked for about a week, then it would no longer charge. I returned it and got a REFURBISHED UNIT in exchange.The refurbished unit did better.. it lasted 3 weeks before failing. To use it, I must use the charger plug constantly, as the unit will not charge.Sending it back now to try a third unit."
4,Great Bluetooth GPS Receiver,We were very pleased when we used this unit on our vacation along with DeLorme map software on our laptop. It provided a more consistent signal than the DeLorme GPS receiver. The only improvement that I would make: make it rechargable battery powered to eliminate the additional power cord. The Garmin software is more limited so I would suggest either DeLorme or Microsoft mapping software if using on a laptop.
4,Works great - but steep learning curve,"I purchased the GPS10 to use with my HP2495 PDA. The GPS technology is great - and still borders on magic - but the setup and use of the Mapsource software that's included with the receiver is a little difficult (at least for a guy like me who hates to read the instructions). Once you get it all figured out and configured correctly, the system does work as advertised. I just completed a trip from OKC to Dallas and I located a half dozen addresses all around the DFW Metroplex with no problem. I would like to see some kind of a battery status indicator on the receiver but since I run mine off my car's power outlet all of the time I guess that it doesn't matter."
4,GPS 10 deluxe with BT/mapping DVD,I recieved my system in good condition. Loaded it on PC downloaded to PDA with no problem. The software has a free update DVD. At Garmin web site filled out the form to order update. Loaded the one I recieved onto PC/PDA all works excellent.James
3,50/50 on the software/hardware combination,"Advantage:The GPS software is little hard to use because of all the features. But one you master it, the positive greater than the negative.The battery does last for long time. At least you can use it for 12 hour of driving.Disadvantage:Non-removable battery.Software can only use with GPS10 and GPS10 onlyWhenever you run iQue as map only, it away search of GPS10 even when you don't want to use GPS10. Very annoying. Can find a way to turn it off until it timeout."
3,fair workmanship,"I recieved the clock as a gift. It was a wonderful surprise.The style fits beautifully in my living room. only the top section seems to oak, the rest is particle board that looks like oak (which the paint was missed in a couple of spots) I wouldnt want the family to know that the clock comes ""un-assembled"". not a big deal except the door does not line up, the ""weights"" are decrative, in place (gold plastic). It does have a pleasant chime, and keeps time. if i hadnt put it together i probably would not be able to tell thats its a fair quality knock off. A friend thought it looked expensive. Its just sad that the company that made this doesnt have better quality control before pieces are shipped."
5,Healthy,This product does give me energy and does not taste badly. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in it.
2,Ugh! Tastes like a pond full of algea.,Maybe I will try it in juice like another reviewer suggested. . .in water it is not pallatable.
2,Liquid Chlorophyll,"I thought there was mint in this product, but no. It tastes really bad, I can only drink it in O.J."
5,Great Stuff,"Chlorophyll in itself is great for your body. If you don't have time to juice some wheatgrass, which is a very great thing for your body, chlorophyll is great to have as a ready made supplement. I bought this for my grandma who suffers from arthritis and she says it helps alleviate the pain. Can't beat that when she has the horrible pain she does!"
4,Tastes good too!,I've taken the Chlorophyll liquid daily for 3 weeks and notice an increase in my metabolism and energy. I'm getting ready to reorder so I don't run out.
2,Doesn't pour nicely,"Chlorophyll has many health benefits, but no matter how careful I was, my fingers were stained green after each use."
4,Two kinds of songs,"Some songs aren't that good, but the others make the CD worth listening. Personnaly, I do believe that their previous CD was better, but ís a GREAT CD. The critic above is too negative in my opinion. I can only confirm what i've read in the other two reviews: if you like RAMMSTEIN (they are great!) and if you like to open your mind and do a little philosophy, you should listen to Clawfinger (check out their previuos CD, 'Use your brain')."
2,beware - you could lose all your passwords,"I used it for a year and got burned. When my old palm died and I tried to restore the data from the PC to a new palm, it came up in a demo mode that would not let me enter any new data. There was an option to use my invoice to download a new copy, but was even worse - it wiped out all my data stored in the PC. I contacted customer service a number of times and they never responded."
1,Handango Vault Problems,Great software but don't buy a new computer and try and transfer your password files. You cannot transfer the software or even reinstall it. Repeated calls and messages to customer service went unanswered.
4,Lagartija Nick,"I was first introduced to this band when I was traveling in Spain and had the opportunity to hear them playing live, for free, at a town's outdoor festival. I am always looking for new/foreign music of all genres and asked someone in the audience for the name of the band which led me to search online. There are more CD's available except you have to fly to Spain and search for them in the local record shops. I managed to find 3 at the store I came across, and another at the airport. They are all decent CD's and were definitely worth the Euros I spent on them. As far as I have gathered from the CD's and my understanding of Spanish, this is just a rock band, not associated with any movie."
5,WIX filter,"WIX makes some of the best filters, including oil filters. I use them on all my vehicles.Easy to install. Avoid high dealer/service cost and do it your self."
4,Lexus Wix cabin air filter,Very similar to the OEM filter and easy to change. The dealer really overcharges for changing this filter given the low cost of the part and ease of installation. The filter does not clearly show the direction of air flow for installation which is the reason for 4 v. 5 stars.
3,Great art smashed on page,"This is the best book on Street Art and individual artists available, hands down. Way too many boks on the subject try and turn it into a gallery exhibit, but c-100 shows the pieces just as they should be: in their natural, urban setting.With that said, this book is horribly laid out, designed, and edited. I think every page of text has some typo error in it, and the overall design is just very cluttered and hard to follow. The text, especially the artist interviews are often illegible, which is a shame because they have good information. ANd overall, the images are smashed 10-16 a page. i really wish someone would have stepped in and edited it.As a graphic designer, I love the subject matter and the concept, but I cant stand seeing someting so interesting be so poorly handled.Buy it to look at the awesome (albeit small-sized) art, just dont try and read the text."
4,great subject matter poorly handled,"The name of the book reflects the content well, it's not a ""graffiti"" book. C-100 covers a lot of artists and styles but unfortunately all images are very small (but good and high-quality) and there is no text at all. I think this book should be more than just an image gallery. There is a little survey, which some of the artists included in the book had to fill out, but most of them just make fun of it missing the great opportunity to introduce themselves to the world, well, maybe they just don't need it, it's a street art anyway."
3,"In a word, Small","Because I bought Art of Rebellion 2 first, I was surprised to find that the first edition was much smaller than I expected. It's only about A5 size, soft cover compared to the hardback no.2. Go for two. it's much better."
2,It is not worth the money,"I ordered 3 bottles of this product. And after eat 30 days, I did not see any result worth the money. I don't what is the difference between I drink water and eat this product.And when try to contact customer service, always nobody answer the phone, I left message, there was no one to return my call either."
