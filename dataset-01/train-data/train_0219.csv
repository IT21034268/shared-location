2,leaky bottles,These bottles leak too much because the nipples are too big. I do however like the shape of the bottles because its easy to pour water in it.
3,Good bottle when it doesn't leak,I was happy to read that other mothers have had problems with this bottle leaking and it wasn't just me doing something incorrectly. I recieved 2 Avent bottles as a free promotion and decided to try them. When they don't leak - I like the bottle very much. Sometimes I can get through a feed without a leak and sometimes I can't. I've kept the bottles as spares.
1,Hated these bottles,"Bottom line, we have found that we needed to try several different bottles before finding the right bottle for both of our twins. These Avents were highly recommended and were great for breastmilk storage at the beginning when we first brough them home, but found that the nipples were nothing like the breast, didn't vent properly, and were not doing the job we hoped for!We tried Gerber and Evenflow and finally the Playtex disposable system, which we were hesitant because of the cost the liners. We found that they both did much better with the Playtex nipples since they didn't suck air and the nipple was more like the breast. We also found that the cost of the liners wasn't much of a problem because the store brand is equally reliable.On the other hand, my sister-in-law has twins and swears by these bottles! It all depends on your kiddo! I have several of both sizes used only for milk storage since I was stocking up for two kids that will just sit there!"
2,They leak like crazy!,"These bottles are awful. They leak constantly. Nothing you do stops them from leaking. Avent's animation one their site showing you how to ""properly"" screw on the top is a joke. Tried it, bottles still leak.We might switch but we invested too much money in these bottles. Dont make the same mistake we have. Look at the reviews of other ""real"" people..."
2,Bottles always leak!,"I loved the wide bottle and the nipples on the Avent bottles, but they always leaked. We tried everything possible and found that leaving the ring around the nipple a little loose helped somewhat, but didn't alleviate the problem. My son always ended up covered in breastmilk. There are lots of other wide bottles that work better and cost less."
1,I HATE THESE (...)THINGS,"Not only do they leak all over the place, the nipples don't fit properly (it's not you it's the nipple)They just plan (...)Also my son he did'nt like the nipple, it's nothing like my breast.So I ended up going to the store to see if I could find the latex nipple Avent does not make one!!! Go figure. I went online to see if the company would be of any help...NOT!!! So I ended up buying Gerber and Evenflow bottles and nipples...HE LOVES THEM.So my bottom line is...DO NOT BUY THESE BOTTLES...."
4,Good but leaks,"I like this bottle becouse it is easy to clean,and does not have a lot of parts to it!The one bad thing is for what ever reason once in a while the bottle leaks!!! You do not know it till you have soaked the baby which means you need to change the little one AGAIN."
4,GREAT BOTTLES,I love these bottles. I really like them because it is smooth feeding for the baby. When the baby is sucking it does not sound like the baby can not keep up with the flow of the formula.
3,GREAT BOTTLES MINUS THE LEAKING!,"My newborn didnt do well with any of the other bottles but she does great with these. For my daughter these bottles are ideal but they do leak which is quite a problem. Without the leaking I would give these bottles 5 stars. This could definitly be a problem for moms who use breastmilk in these bottles b/c sometimes that milk is hard to come by and your time put into pumping it and the value of every drop is wasted in a mere second. As far as gas, vomiting, etc...these so far are great for my little one."
4,We love these,"These are our favorite bottles. We tried others, but our son preferred these. He has very little trouble with burping or gas, and I suspect that some gassiness is normal, so the type of bottle wouldn't matter. If milk comes out of the corners of your baby's mouth, you need to switch to a different nipple with a smaller number on it. As they get older, you need to switch to a higher numbered nipple. The only trouble: cost! It's a bit expensive to replace nipples, and I recently had to switch to bigger bottles, which was really costly. However, if it keeps our son healthy and happy, it's worth it!"
3,Average,"I heard a lot of hype about these bottles and the Isis pump. First off I love the pump!! The bottles are suppose to be designed for breastfeeding moms, but the nipple gags my baby. And yes they do sometimes leak. They do the job but are no more than average. I got a Playtex bottle just to see and they work much better for her. Now I use these to pump the milk in and freeze, then I switch the milk to a different bottle for feeding."
1,"Leaks, Leaks, Leaks","I too registered for these bottles for my shower. I am a new mom and I thought that these bottles would be great. However, I was very disappointed to find that they would constantly leak. My son would get soaked during his feedings and I had to switch after only a few weeks. I have also found that by switching to the Playtex VentAire bottles that he doesn't swallow as much air and doesn't need his Mylecon drops anymore. These bottles are a terrible waste of money."
3,9 oz bottles don't fit in First Years Bottle Warmer,I was disappointed to find out that my 9oz Avent bottles did not fit in my warmer like the 4oz bottles did. My bottles also leaked from the ring. [...]
1,induced gag reflex!,"Baby is breast-fed and I registered for these so I could pump and my husband could feed her at night. Our baby hated the bottle and wouldn't take the nipple. The nipples, on the Avent, are too long and hard and would make her gag when she attempted to latch on. We switched to the Platex NaturalLatch and now she takes a bottle. The nipples on the Platex are much softer and shorter. Baby switches between the bottle and breast now, no problem."
2,frustrated,I used Avent bottles for my now 2 1/2 year old and found them great and horrible. They were great for mixing powder formula right in the bottle and very easy to clean because of the wide opening. The silicon nipples hold up well after many uses and even hold up well in the dishwasher. They also cut down on gas and spit ups because they are air tight. They are horrible because they leak!! Sometimes the lid would go on just right and I would have no problems and other times it would take me 10 tries before getting the lid on just right. I first thought I must be doing something wrong but after talking to several other mothers I found they were all having the same problem. This is very frustrating when you have a screaming crying baby who is waiting for her bottle! I am now expecting twins and will not be using Avent this time! I can not afford to waist 10 minutes trying to screw on a lid just right when I have two screaming babies waiting to be fed!
4,YOUR SCREWING THE CAP ON WRONG!!!!!,"I've read serveral reviews on this product throughout my prenancy and most of them said that these bottles leak. I almost did'nt use the Avent bottles i got at my shower because of the horrible reviews. When my son was about to be born i asked a friend of mine who had used Avent with both of her children and she explained to me that the bottles only leak when you screw the cap on wrong. She told me that people are lazy and should call the company when they have problems. The proper way to screw the cap on is to screw it on with the cover on it. Make sure you dont screw it on too tight as well. My son is not born yet, but know that i know how to prevent leakage with these bottles i will give them a try."
2,they leak alot,This was the first bottle i bought and to tell you the truth i hate it. This bottle leaks. The bottle made more mess tnan my baby. I no longer use this bottle.
2,Breastfeeding mommy...,"I know that the Avent brand is supposed to be the perfect bottle for switching back and forth from breast to bottle, but whose nipple is as hard and erect as the nipple on the Avent bottles? My baby had a hard time latching onto the Avent nipple and seemed to always have violent gas attacks right after finishing a bottle. I like how convenient and no-fuss the Avent bottles are, but I decided to switch only to make it easier for my little one. We now use the Ventaires, which are such a dream-come-true for feeding! I still have the Avent bottles and hope to use them when I am no longer breastfeeding. Hopefully by the time he is sitting up and can easily burp on his own without having to prop him up."
5,Well Worth The Cost!!,"We purchased many different kinds of bottles for our son. He had colic so we focused on the Dr. Browns bottles (AWFUL!!)and the AVENT. We have had nothing but luck with these bottles. i have at least 15 of them between the 4 oz and the 9 oz. NONE of mine have EVER leaked!! The nice thing part is as your baby gets older you can change the nipple to accommodate him and when he gets old enough the bottles can be converted into the AVENT ""Magic Cup."" (the sippie cup) Thus saving another trip to the store later on. We have gotten rid of the rest of our bottles and continue to have GREAT luck with these!! I suggest these to everyone!"
5,Great for breast fed babies!!,First tried vent aire system with nothing but problems from leaking to being a pain to clean with so many seperate parts. Switched to avent and have not had any problems and my newborn switches between bottle and breast without any confusion with these nipples. No leaking issues either. I would highly recommend these bottles.
5,The best bottle around!,"I used this system for my son. He easily switched back and forth between breast and bottle, even at an early age, and never had problems. The wide mouth is great for mixing forumla. It will leak if you don't screw it on just right, but that's the parent's fault, not the bottle's! He never had a problem with gas or spit up, and transitioned into the sippy cup easily with the Magic Cups and the bottles being interchangeable. I am pregnant again and would never consider using anything else! I am looking forward to the new disposable cups."
1,terriable bottles,"We registered for these bottles after using Playtex Vent Aire bottles with our previous foster kids. After a terriable first couple weeks with the AVENT bottles we switched back to the Vent Aire bottles. The AVENT bottles leaked all over our newborn, the nipples were way too big for her tiny mouth and the milk would come flowing out the sides of her mouth. She soaked 1-2 clothes per feeding we never knew how much was acctually getting to her belly!! Our little girl also had terriable gas pains, and very loud choking type adult burps while on these bottles. All this changed for the better after switching to Vent Aire. I do not reccomend AVENT bottles. They do look nice, and appear to be great but they are not!! I suggest using the playtex Vent Aire system."
2,Not happy,"I am not happy with the Avent bottles due to the leakage. I contacted the company who explained in detail how to assemble the bottles so that they don't leak. It does work, however at 3am with a fussy baby I prefer a bottle that is quick and easy. Avent is not. I ended up switching to Dr. Brown and am very pleased. It does reduce gas as it advertised."
1,Not a happy baby,"I have used these bottles for 6 weeks and in the last 3 weeks of use My son had cramps, gas and very huge burps. He would even burp a while after eating.. He was gasping for air while feeding.. Not a happy mommy or baby...."
3,Great for colic - but these leak!,"These bottles are great for avoiding colic, my son went from breast to bottle without any problem. Now he has been weaned and is just using the bottles I am noticing how much they leak! It doesn't matter how I first put the ring on the bottle, I have to adjust 2-3 times as milk always leaks out. I haven't replaced the bottles as once I get it JUST RIGHT and it stops leaking, my son is happy. It is a little annoying though. Had we been using these from the start 8x a day, I might have bought something else. The steamer we got with the bottles for use in the microwave is great."
1,THESE BOTTLES LEAK!,"I purchased these bottles for my second child and found out that unless you screw them on ""RIGHT"" they leak. With my first born I used the Dr.Browns, they're really great for transition with breastfeeding. I do not recommend the AVENT bottles at all, although I do think they're ISIS breastpump is really great."
3,Not As Pleased As I Thought I'd Be.,"We recieved these bottles as a gift for our son (now 16 months)and expected greatness from Avent. When I opened the first package I was amazed at how stiff the nipples were that are included with these bottles. Stiffness is hardly a correct simulation of the breast. The bottles are also very wide and hard for little hands to grip when they begin to hold their own bottles. I also saw no indication that my son got any less air from using the Avent system. I MUCH prefer the softer, easier to hold, less air producing Playtex Nursers which is what we ended up switching him to."
3,Nothing too good for my baby ... but too leaky!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am surprisingly disappointed in the way these bottles leak ... no matter how tight you screw on the ring or how snug the nipple is! There is no getting around it! Being a first time mom, nothing was too good for my baby or too expensive for that matter! BUT...these bottles leak and make quite a mess on your little one's outfit! And my baby still gets gas and burps with these bottles. I know nothing is perfect, but for the investment you make w/Avent, they should not leak!"
3,So-So bottles,I breast-fed my daughter for 8 months. I used a Medela pump to express milk and whenever I had to give her a bottle it was one of the Medela storage bottles that she drink from. She never had any problems with nipple confusion. Upon deciding to wean her I talked to many friends about bottles and they all suggested the Avent system. Immediately I noticed the leaking problem! I never knew anything about tightening the cap too much until reading the reviews on this site just today. I will give it a try and see if it helps since I've already invested quite a bit of money in Avent. One good thing is that my daughter is 9 months and will be graduating to the sippy cup soon. The wide mouth on the bottles make it easy to mix formula and clean them but the leaks drive me crazy! If I had these bottles from the begining I'm sure I would have bought others by now. Whoever decided that making the cap so sensitive would be a good idea must not have any children.
1,They leak and leak and leak.,"These bottles leak terribly. We couldn't figure out why at first. After reading online complaints, we found out that the inner seal vents need to be aligned a certain way to prevent leaking. The problem, however, is that they repeatedly slip out of place even after they have been arranged properly. It is a terrible product."
1,highly overrated,"I'm writing because I'm horrified by how many new and expecting mothers assume that Avent bottles are so great just because they see everyone else with them. I was one of these mistaken fools: several friends and my sister-in-law used them and I thought--oh, this must be the thing to do--and bought and registered for them. Come to find out, when I asked all these folks, they HATED the bottles. They LEAK all the time!!! I don't care what the AVENT consultants say about not tightening them too much (I called customer service) -- sometimes they will leak even halfway through a feeding, SOAKING everyone after deceptively seeming fine. They are expensive too and just not worth it. Normally I do not write reviews, but I am moved to do so right now due to all the above misinformation."
2,Leaks ! !,"I have a 2 yr old and I used these faithfully with her when she was a baby. The biggest problem is they leak all of the time. The formula would get on the couch or me or my daughter. We then graduated to the sippy cup, just adding the sippy cup part to the exsisting bottle, well these leak too. I am having our second child in April, and I will be switching to another brand !"
5,Great Product,"I breast fed for 8 months straight...and when it came time to use a bottle this is the ONLY one my child would use. Believe me I tried ALL of them.Pros: Never had any leaking problems, easy to clean on a count of wide/short bottle(good for people without dishwasher), compared to long/thin kind of most,and son loved it,easy to hold.Cons: Odd shape, diaper bags are made for the long/thin bottles....hence the fact I stated....doesn't leak, above.Then again, I guess it will be the preference of your child also, good luck"
5,Best Design Bottle and Teat for Hungry Baby.,These are the widest bottles that I have seen available. They are well made and easy to assemble. I sterilise mine every day and there has been no fading of level markers (a problem with another make I tried.) or discolouration of bottles. They come with a whole range of accessories like handles and sippy cup teats for older babies and so will go from Day 1 right through to when you no longer need sippy cups. The best thing for me is the fact that you can get specially designed teats that allow for thicker liquids (my son had rice in his milk at 8 weeks (with Doctors approval) because he is so big (90th Percentile) and was so very hungry. The Adjustable Flow teat has a slot cut instead of a hole and so the flow depends on the way the teat is lined up with the babies nose. What a fantastic idea and such a godsend for us. They also hook up directly to an avent breast pump either the manual or electric.
1,Leaky!,Leaks! Especially difficult to get a tight seal if you use one hand (while holding baby). A much better design is the Breast Flow Learning Curve First Years bottles. Instead buy The First Years 3pk. Breastflow 5oz. Bottles These worked much better for me.
2,infuriating!!,"The good points... easy to clean, no stupid liners to deal with, clearly marked nipples, correct measurement marks on bottle sides(surprisingly uncommon)The bad... impossible to tell if the collar is screwed on correctly, until you shake it and milk gets everywhere, or dumps all over baby during feeding. Also slowest nipple is much faster than playtex or gerber, and tough for slow eaters to get used to.The screw issue makes these useless for me to travel with, as everything gets soaked. Just a stupid design."
2,"Easy to clean, popular bottles but annoyingly LEAKY","Out of all the bottles on the market, Avent bottles are the easiest to clean because of the wider shape. My baby also seems to be comfortable with drinking from this bottle. The most annoying thing though about these bottles is that they leak. I've tried so many techniques and sometimes it will still leak. One would think that Avent should figure out a way to resolve this. Aside from the occasional leaks, these bottles are perfect."
1,no orthodontic nipples,"I registered for this bottle because I read it was the best to use when breastfeeding. But my son was not able to latch on to the nipple well. When I fed him from this bottle, the milk would leak out of the sides of his mouth--a lot! We switched to the Playtex disposable nurser with the orthodontic nipple shape, and he latched on to it perfectly -- no leaking at all!!!! I wish Avent would make an orthodontic nipple, because now we have all these bottles that we can't use. Also, the lactation consultant I talked to recommended only using orthodontic nipples if you're breastfeeding. I learned this after I already received these bottles as gifts."
2,Didn't work for us.,"The lactation consultant recommended these bottles to use while breast-feeding. We were having troubles latching on and were told the wide nipple would help him get a wide mouth. These bottles didn't work for us. The nipple flow was too fast. They dripped all over. He was very fussy after eating because of the gas. The Mylicon drops didn't help much.I even tried the Avent bottle with the plastic bag for less air. It didn't work either. It was impossible to get all of the air out. There is a feature at the bottom of the bottle to push up the liquid, but it didn't go all the way to the top and was also frustrating. Plus, the regular Avent nipples don't work with this bottle. You have to buy more nipples. We didn't care for these at all."
2,These bottles leak,"I received these bottles as a gift. They were fine for the first few days, but after a couple of weeks they started to leak. I had 4, and 3 of them leaked. I thought I screwed the top on wrong, but after having poured formula on my son several times I relized it wasn't me. The bottles are now in the trash. I recommend Dr. Browns bottles, they work really great."
2,Leaky bottles- dont waste your money,"I bought the avent bottles and sterilizing unit.At first I thought they were great. The sterilizing unit was super convenient and easy to use.After using the bottles a few times, I noticed they really started to leak. Formula would actually pour out from under the collar when tipped to feed baby. Let me tell you, this is not fun in the middle of the night! baby's clothes would get soaked.I switched to the Platex disposable bottles, I LOVE THEM.Never have to scrub or sterilize a bottle again! And the best part, they NEVER leak!"
1,Do not by these bottles!!!!,All they do is leak.. I was so disappointed with the whole Avent system.
2,Another complaint about leaking....,"I registered for the Dr. Brown and Avent bottles for my first baby. I prefered the shape of the Avent bottles and the shape of the nipple to the long/narrow shape of the Dr. Brown. And they were easier to clean. HOWEVER, after several times of formula leaking onto my son's chest and soaking his clothing and neck and hair I started to throw away nipples and caps, thinking they were faulty. I bought new ones. Then I learned they leak due to the way they are screwed on. What a hassle! I now have twins and use all bottles I own--the Dr. Brown narrows and the Avent leaky's. I have learned to live with the leaks (I always remember to check them before I give them to the babies). But, now that Dr. Browns offers the short/wide neck bottles I would recommend them hands down!"
1,These are THE WORST!!!!,"Like many others, I registered for these bottles because they were supposed to be the best out there. After they started leaking, I just sucked it up for a while. Then I got aggravated enough to write to AVENT on their website. They wrote back to me that I was screwing them on too tight. So, i took their advice, and now, after washing the diaper bag for the umpteenth time because the contents of the bottles spilled out all over, I have written to them again. I don't think that I should have to worry about how tight I am screwing the tops on. I should be able to twist the top on and rest assured that my child won't go hungry and scream because his formula is all over the bottom of the diaper bag!"
3,Okay,"These bottles are just okay. I registered for them because of all the good things that I heard about them. First of all, they do leak. Making sure they are completely dry does help but does not prevent the problem entirely. Second of all, they are expensive. I have heard just as many good things about other brands of bottles that are a lot less expensive. For my next baby I will not be using these."
1,Leaky!!,"The bottles were fine at first, but are now terribly leaky 3 weeks after I started using them!! Most of the breast milk in the bottles is wasted because of the leakiness. Waste of time and money!"
1,Leak..Leak..Leak!,"These bottles leak horribly. Yes, I know how to work a bottle. They leak all over the baby. I would recomend Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles. So much less air gets in the bottle and the nipples are ideal for switching from breast to bottle. These bottles are supposed to reduce air bubbles? Yeah, right. Do not waste your money."
2,LEAKS!!!!,These worked good for about 3 weeks and they started to leak. I went to the Avent website and they said that I was overtightening the bottles and that was causing the leak. Well less tightening did not help. Don't waste money. I am using the Playtex Premium Nurser now and it's much better.
1,Wet Baby,"These bottles come with an extra plastic piece on the inside. Most bottles do, except with the other bottles the plastic piece is disposable packaging. Don't make the mistake of throwing it away when you purchase AVENT Bottles or else you'll end up with a wet baby from the leaking bottle. Why purchase these more expensive bottles when you have an extra piece that needs to be washed and kept up with in order for them to function properly? I don't get it! I recommend Nuk bottles as a better plastic alternative."
3,Great in theory but lack performance,"I love the nipple and large neck design of these bottles. I've never had a problem with the nipple flattening out like some other brands. However, the bottles leak. There doesn't seem to be any proven technique to attached the nipple and ring that works 100% of the time. It's very frustrating to have to change a baby's clothes in the middle of the night because the bottle has leaked all over them. If you haven't already purchased the bottle system, I would research other brands."
1,VERY FRUSTRATED,"I had thought I loved these bottles...but I have never been so dissapointed and frustrated ...2am ,my daughter is completely soaked!!! now she is starving,freezing,being changed and hungry in the middle of the night!!!they leak so much and formula is expensive!!! I want my money back!!!"
2,Faulty product,"My opinion is that Avent Philips has developed a faulty product. I purchased the two pack of the 9oz bottles. They leak. The vents leak milk/formula. I went to the Avent Philips website and found where the company recognizes this flaw and suggests to reassemble the nipple and bottle-cap portion while still wet from cleaning and do not overtighten. Still leaks. Then through further web-searching I found where an outstanding user of these bottles mentioned to reassemble the lid and nipple with at least two of the vents under the threads of the cap. This has limited success. In the end, I am overly frustrated with no response from Avent Philips to my inquiries and further frustrated with the fact that one needs a degree in product engineering to assemble a friggin' bottle to feed their child! My recommendation is to find a bottle that you can put the lid on and not worry about the positioning of vents, over-tightening, etc...."
3,"My favorite bottles, but...","These are actually my favorite bottles from all the different ones we ended up with. My reasons:They don't come in a million pieces like ventAires, but they're still round, unlike the gerber one we have. These things put them at the top of my list for easy cleaning. The nipple flow is alright, too. It's not the slowest to start out with, but it's slower than some other nipples that automatically come with some bottles.So, why did I only give it three stars? I haven't found anything that says these are BP-A free, which, for me, knocks them down two stars. Too bad."
1,Bad Experience,"I bought the Avent bottles with the best of expectations. The first sign of my let down was how bad they leaked. If you screw the lid on too tight, they leak and you have to loosen it so they won't. I recently discovered that my son's trouble eating was also due to the large size of the nipples. I switched to the the old faithful, Playtex Nursers, and he's eating much more relaxed and much better now. I can't tell you the difference. The nipples are just too fat on the Avent system."
2,A Word of Warning,"I bought these for my daughter. I have been using them since she was born, but I have had (like a lot of other people) trouble with them leaking. I have had so many problems with leaks that I am considering not using them for my next child. Sometime the only way to fix the leak is to take the nipple out of the ring and run water over it. As you can imagine, this is not very helpful when we are away from home. I have tried to just not screw them down as tight, but it doesn't always work."
1,Save your money,"The manufacturer claims these bottles vent and therefore reduce gas and spit-up, but I don't think we found it's effective. Besides, they do leak a lot, and are very touchy about how you screw the ring on. Sure, you can wet the nipple like the maker recommends to create a seal, but if you sterilize your bottles and nipples wetting them with tap water defeats the purpose of sterilization. So you pretty much have to assemble the bottle right before feeding. We also were very frustrated by the fact that the nipples wear out fast (get larger holes), yet they are stiff making it frustrating for the babies to suckle. As compared to other feeding systems, this is not worth it - get Dr Brown's instead and save your money, because if your baby has problems with gas you'll probably end up trying Dr Brown's anyhow. I have twin boys and we feed them breast milk that I pump, so leaking is such a waste... I wouldn't recommend this feeding system."
2,Great at first then began LEAKING!,"I loved this bottles for the first few months. Afterwards some bottles started leaking around the rim a little then worsened. Gave up on them after several weeks of trying to figure out how to stop it from leaking. Switch to Gerber bottles, they work just as well and they don't leak."
3,Alright bottles,"I've only tried the 9oz bottles and they leak for me alot. It's really annoying since I spent so much money thinking that they were quality. They also make alot of noise when my son eats. And he doesn't like the nipple, it's too thick for him to get a good suction. One thing that is good is these bottles don't give him gas which I've tried cheap bottles and he gets gassy with them. After trying alot of bottles the only brand I have absolutely no problem with is the Dr.Brown bottles. They are just the best. But they have extra parts to clean which is a pain."
4,No leaks here,"I have 11 Avent bottles all purchased at seperate times and have never, not once had any one of them leak. They are more expensive, but think about the money the Playtex Nurser liners cost over the course of your baby's bottle years, it adds up! Also, with the Avent system you can buy spouts that convert the bottles into Sippy cups and save money on new cups. I have also used Second Nature brand nipples with the Avent bottles and they worked perfectly, those of you having problems with Avent leaking, but like the style of Avent Bottles and nipples may want to check out that brand (sold at Target.com and babycenter.com)"
2,Avent feeding bottles,"I do NOT recommend these bottles. They leak on you! As in at 3:00 AM, as in - in your diaper bag leaving ounces of stinky sticky formula all over your clean change of clothes and everything else in your bag! They leak from where the white collar twists onto the bottle! You have to triple check the seal repeatedly because they will not leak and 5 minutes later leak."
1,Leaky bottles,these bottles have given us nothing but problems they leak all the time and make a huge mess!! Not worth the money!!!
5,avent is great!,"the avent bottles are wonderful! our son did not have any difficulty switching between the breast at home and these bottles at daycare. the nipples are great and come in a variety of sizes(to adjust flow/output) that grow with your child. they are easy to wash due to their large openings, durable, and contoured so that even little hands can help hold them. i have been using them for almost six months and have never had a problem with them leaking. these bottles are becoming so popular that we needed to mark ours since other children at daycare use them!"
2,Making the switch!,"I am online now looking for new bottles. I'm not sure why it even took me this long. My daughter is 3 months old now, and we received so many Avent Bottles at my shower that I could probably stock Amazon.com's shelves with them! At any rate, bottom line...they leak. They leak so badly, and there is nothing that you can do that will fix the problem so that I am guarenteed a dry baby 100% of the time. It's like playing Russian Roulette. Hence, I never get her dressed up in something that I want her to stay remotely nice in before a feeding. I also have a baby that spits up about 80% of the time, and I will be very curious to know how she will be after making this switch. I believe I am going to purchase the Dr. Brown's system. At least 3 bottles anyways and we'll see how it goes. Anyone that thinks they might be interested in these overrated Avent bottles, Good luck, and make sure you also buy extra ""Dreft Laundry detergent"" while you are at it...you will need it. :)"
1,Crying over spilled milk!,"These bottles leak something fierce. I have twin boys and am currently pumping milk and bottle feeding them. It's hard enough to pump milk for two babies. But then to have the milk come spilling out of these poorly designed bottles. It's so frustrating. Does anyone at AVENT use this product?? If so, maybe they would make a better quality bottle. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying away from these bottles."
2,Not impressed...,"I was having my 3rd child , with the other 2 I used Gerber and wanted to try something new. So I had seen the Avent in all the magazines and the brand just keep coming up, so I assumed it has to be a great bottle. I bought all the entire set up of Avent. I had to give it to my friend, she is still breast feeding so I have yet to find out if it will work for her. I went to the store and bought my Gerber and couldn't be happier. They are easy to hold not big and bulky like Avent.Avent is harder for a baby ready to hold her/his bottle to do so. I recommend buying one of each of the brands and not buying the entire set up..bottles can not be returned so it becomes a waste of money."
4,Works but does leak at times,"I used Avent bottles with my first son and after about a month of using them I found that they did leak. I thought it was just me or my husband not using them right. I found that if you put them in the dishwasher (the nipples) the seem more likely to leak. Also, we bought a MAWS bottle, now called Tommee Tippie, and put the avent nipple in that bottle and have had no problems. I didn't like the nipple that came with that bottle so I tried Avent's nipple with the bottle and it worked. It is the best system I have found. No leaks, no fuss, just a great combo. Just some advice."
3,Not so great,"These bottles were recommended by many sources in the hospital and outside as well. They were not as great as people had said. My baby did not care for them, as the bottle nipple was hard plastic. My baby and myself prefer the softer, more pliable nipples that are closer to the real thing, since we are also breastfeeding at the same time. We found the Playtex Nuk nipples to be more user friendly and softer."
3,Great for mom - Not for son.,"I love this bottle for the wide opening, easy to clean, very durable, no leakage, stores great in freezer or refrigerator, goes great in dishwasher, easy to measure and mix formula, etc. For all intents and purposes, this is the greatest bottle made. But, my son just can't latch on well enough to keep all the formula in his mouth. I thought he just had trouble sucking, so out of curiosity, I just bought a cheap little bottle that had a smaller nipple. He had no trouble at all with sucking - we didn't need a bib to give him his bottle! It only took us 5 months to figure it out. I love Avent and all their products, especially the new ""sippy cup"" feature for their bottles, but my son just needs something smaller. I'm trying Dr. Browns, based on the reviews. Sorry Avent!"
2,These leak milk like a British car leaks oil,"Ironically, right on the bottle it says ""Made in England"". Frequently, in the middle of a feeding, a lot of the milk will start running out through the seal between the nipple and the bottle, directly onto your child, your pants, your furniture, for no apparent reason. If they could solve the leaking problem, these would get 5 stars, but they just leak."
5,Great Bottles!,"I've NEVER had a problem with these bottles. Before I bought them, I read other reviewers posts and noticed that there were a lot of negative comments about them. However, I decided to go ahead and try them out and I'm glad that I did. These bottles are bulky and durable. While a little on the pricey side, I think they are well worth it. My son is now 4 months old and has never had any problems with gas.For clarification purposes, I've never had a problem with them leaking. I've always followed the manufacturers instructions by making sure that the nipples are wet BEFORE assembly."
4,Great Product...Only complaint is they leak,"If it weren't for the leaking, I would have give the product 5 stars. I have had great luck with these bottles and nipples, except for the fact that sometimes they leak. It does help to wet the nipple and ring prior to putting them together, but if you don't have a perfect seal they will leak when you start to shake the bottle for mixing. Leaking is also the biggest complaint I have heard from other moms. It does not happen every time I make a bottle, but often enough that I have considered complainig to Avent. This has been my ONLY frustration with product.Otherwise, they are dishwasher durable and the markings on the bottle are still on after months of use and washings."
2,Yes I read the instructions... and they still leak!,Really disappointed with these bottles and am glad my daughter will soon be on to using a sippy cup exclusively. I've read the instructions and still have leaky bottles about 2/3 of the time.
1,Baby gets too much air,"I registered Avent bottles after hearing from family how they were such great bottles. Even though I was breastfeeding my son, I had to supplement him with a bottle, so he got used to drinking from a bottle right away. It would take us forever to do a feeding. He would keep spitting the bottle out. A simple feeding would take an hour. He was also screaming out in pain after having his bottle because he would get so much air from the bottle. After 1 week of pain for my son, I went out an bought new bottles. I bought Ventaire bottles and Playtex bottles and those have worked so well. Now, our feedings are fast and he doesn't fuss afterwards. I would NOT recommend these bottles."
2,Leaky bottles,I agree with several other Mom's regarding the leaking bottles. It is so frustrating to loose precious Mothers Milk because of a leaky bottle or have messy sticky formula all over your kitchen floor. I would not use them if they had not been given to me as a shower gift.
2,Don't waste your money.,"While I have nothing but good things to say about the claim that this bottle helps to reduce gas and colic, I am extremely dissatisfied in the structure of the bottle itself. You must line the rings of the bottle and the nipple ring up just right or the contents of the bottle (4- and 9oz and sippy cups) will leak right from under the ring, as the ridges in the bottle and the ring do not go all the way around. It is extremely frustrating to have half the contents of your baby's meal spill out onto their clothes, especially if you have breastmilk supply issues like I did, where half a bottle could have cost you a full day's pumping. I would suggest that if you are looking to prevent gas and colic, try the Dr. Brown's or the Ventair's. If I had it to do over again I would not choose this bottle, and when I have another child I will use a different system altogether."
2,Daughter got to much air! Mother of 4,My daughter liked the nipple but got to much air. I tried these and the Dr. Brown but ended up going back to Playtex Nursers(I used these with all my other kids) I wouldnt recommend these.
2,Love the sippee cups but.....,"I love the ease of transition from the bottle to the sippee cups, but wish I could use the New Traditions bottles from GERBER to nurse my baby and then switch to the AVENT cup system. No matter how much we adjust the nipple and bottle neck system it leaks! Even in the sippee cups the union leaks. I love the feel and shape of the sippee cup spout and so do my kiddos, but it is not fun to always be cleaning up juice, breast milk, and formula from baby and you! If you want the wide mouth system try GERBER New Traditions. They have 3 different nipple types, with variable flows, and an incredible bottle shape that makes it easy for baby and parent to hold. I just wish THEY had the transitional cups also!!! Unfortunately the nipples are different diameters! I gave AVENT 2 stars for their compatibility from bottle to cup, but other than that I would give them none. ..."
2,Not worthy,"These Bottles leak. I couldn't believe that there was something wrong with the bottles... they were too expensive to have this type of problem, so I started to try different techniques like changing nipples, not tightening too much, but nothing worked. The disposable bottled works OK. My baby is 1-year old now and I have throw away all these bottles even though I am expecting again. I had to professionally clean the carpet because there were milk stains all over the house."
2,I hate this bottles,I hate these bottles. No matter how I put them together they would always leak. ...
2,Leaks-R-Us,"I weaned my baby without any serious problems using these bottles. They seem to have a great nipple, but the leaking has come to be a serious inconvenience. Long story short, I'm looking for different bottles."
4,"Really good, but must put together when wet","I really do like these bottles. No annoying bags, or gummy nipples. They must be put together when wet though, or else they leak. It's no different than a manual breast pump..they need a wet seal. I wash them, then pop nipple through ring while wet. When I'm ready to fill the bottles, I run hot water over the ring/nipple and then assemble (not over tightening). I wash mine by hand (Pediatrician advised against dishwasher). I replace the nipples every couple of months, and I sterilize every few weeks to get rid of any build up."
4,better nipples,"I had been afraid that my breastfed baby would prefer the bottle once I started pumping. Instead, we found that he did not like the bottle at all. We had received a free sample of the Avent bottle, and discovered that he liked the nipple much more than the ones on the Medela nursing set that goes with my breast pump. He still would much rather get the real thing, but daddy finds it much easier to feed him with the Avent bottle. My one concern is that the plastic is much more rigid than that of the Medela set...am afraid of dropping over hard surface."
2,Not Worth It,I bought these bottles on the advice of my doctor without reading the reviews first. They are great in terms of feeding/cleaning ... which is why I gave two stars ... but as many others mentioned they leak like crazy! They are not worth the investment. There are many other good bottles out there ... don't even try this one.
1,Garbage. All bottles leaked after using for the first time.,Worst bottles ever. Every one of them leaked on the first feeding. Continued to leak even after routine troubleshooting measures. Don't waste your money.
2,leaks,The bottles leak sometimes and not others. Great when they don't leak but when they do-everyone is wet and sticky! I will never buy these bottles again and have told new moms not to buy :(
2,LEAK LEAK LEAK,"I have used these bottles for 6 months now and they LEAK.It doesn't matter how tight the top is, they leak about 70% of the timeand have to be resealed. It's very, very inconvenient when milk dripsall over the baby and by the time you've finally got it sealed he nolonger wants to eat. I think the bottle is a really poor design.I would definitely not recommend them.Note: the 9oz bottles seem to leak more than the 4oz bottles, thoughthese also leak."
3,Don't live up to the hype!,"I was excited to get a set of these from a friend to try. I'd heard so many great things about them. But, they really didn't live up to the hype. My main brand of bottles has been the Playtex Premium nursers and they have been superior in every way! My breastfed baby does latch well on the Avent, but the base on the Playtex nipples is wider and the more correct latch position. When he sucks, my little guy creates a vacumn in the Avent bottles, stopping the milk flow. Man, he gets upset. Also, when I have made formula in these they leak big time when I shake them. They have been nice to pump into though. Bottom line, try the Playtex nursers. My little guy took to them first try and hasn't had any problems."
2,Too Fast,"Most people I talk to love the Avent Bottles. However, my daughter, primarily being breast fed, had trouble with these bottles. The flow on the stage 1 nipples was way too fast and milk would run down the sides of her mouth. We currently use the Playtex Natural Latch nurser system, and have had no problems feeding."
1,No good for breast-fed babies,"We registerd and received these bottles because of high recommendations from breastfeeding consultants. All we can say is YUCK! Our daughter HATED eating from these and would cry and fuss until she finally got so hungry and took them. She never had a problem with gas or spit-up, but feeding her from this bottle was a nightmare. Each time my husband fed her, it was a battle. So, we switched to the Playtex Natura-Latch nipple in slow flow with the bottles with disposable liners, and she took it on the first try. She started eating right away, and has NEVER cried or fussed while eating from this bottle. This eased my mind knowing she will eat when I go back to work!"
2,Not for everybody...,"I registered for these bottles because everyone I know uses them and loves them and they're supposedly great for switching back and forth from breast to bottle (great since I exclusively use breast milk). However, my son would suck for half an hour and could never get much milk out (has to work too hard, he certainly doesn't work that hard at the breast). Also, he didn't like the nipple shape, he kept trying to put his mouth over the whole nipple to latch on.I gave it two stars since the bottles are definately sturdy and nice looking and my friends have had good luck. Also they work in warmers whereas the ones I use now don't. Unfortunately I now have a pantry full of these bottles from baby showers.If these nipples give your breastfed baby problems, try the Playtex natural shape (disposable and also the new ventair natural shape). Every baby is different but good luck."
1,these bottles ...,"As a first time mom of twins, I believed the ads about these bottles and registered and got the whole she-bang...bottles, nipples, storage rack, sterilizer, etc. Common sense should have told me that tiny baby hands couldn't hold a bottle that big around. Besides that, the nipples split and turn yellow with use, the nipples turn under, making it hard to know if the lid is on tight until formula has dripped all over the baby, and the measurements are often wrong on the bottle...the 4 oz mark should be at 4.5 oz. My sons were having a huge problem feeding themselves until I tried some cheap Gerber bottles that had come free in the mail...the little ones that fit perfectly in their hands...."
2,As an infant teacher..,"I wouldn't recommend these bottles. There ae many others out there with the same benifits, minus the hassle. I can't even COUNT how many times I have been soaked in a mother's breat milk because of the leakage. I have tried screwing them extra tight, I have tried screwing them on the looser side, ... I have even tried putting them on crooked! LOL They don't leak all the time, but when they do, watch out! It comes pouring out like a river! Personally, I used the Playtex disposible bottles. You can get the same great ""mother like"" nipples, same easy clean-up, same gas reduction, and a LOT less leakage! None.. Imagine that?! If you're gonna use the Avent bottles, make sure you have some extra milk/formula, for those occassions you lose half the bottle on you lap!"
2,Leaking Problem Big Time,"This bottle leaks all over my baby.My husband bought a Gerber Suzy's Zoo bottle one day when I left my diaper bag at a restuarnt -- NO LEAKING AT ALL!! Suddenly I realized my baby doesn't have to have a permanently wet neck! She didn't seem to have more gas either!I am buying more Gerber bottles, Playtex and a couple of others now to compare leakage/gas etc. Avent doesn't seem to be all its cracked up to be."
1,EXPENSIVE LEAKY BOTTLES!,These bottles [leak] big time! I'm really mad that I bought so many of these bottles for my twins only to find out that they leak! We don't over-tighten them (only when one leaks on us!). I would not recommend buying this imported yuppie bottle system! So many people shouldn't be having this problem with these bottles.
2,I PERSONALLY WOULD NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN,I HAVE A SON WHO SUFFERED FROM COLIC PROBLEMS SO I FOUND THIS BOTTLE LEAKED AND HAD LOTS OF AIR. I BOUGHT DR BROWN AND IT HAD NO AIR AND HELPED WITH HIS COLIC STOMACHE.I AM ONE OF THOSE PARENTS THAT AVENT DID NOT WORK FOR ME SO EACH CHILD IS DIFFERENT.
1,THEY DO LEAK NO MATTER WHAT!!,"THESE LEAK! We have done everything the mfr recommends and other people and when you have 2 crying babies at 3 am it is no fun leaking formula everywhere! I reluctantly put up with them for 3 months and then I said enough and bought cheap Gerber bottles w/ med nipples and haven't had one leak yet and we have been using for a month now. They are also lighter and easier for our sons to try and hold onto and when you have to prop, which you have to do sometimes with twins, they don't roll. I have no more messes in my diaper bags, my fridge or on my babies from leaking formula. I unfortunately have over 100.00 worth, giving them to a friend having twins, she doesn't mind leaks I guess. A BOTTLE SHOULD NOT REQUIRE A PHD TO TIGHTEN! THE GERBERS ARE FOOLPROOF AND BY THE WAY, THE BOYS HAVE LESS GAS AND SPIT UP TOO! One more bonus - they take up a LOT less room in the dishwasher. Sometimes expensive is not better."
1,These bottles definitely do leak!!!,"These bottles leak, do not buy them. Screwing on a cap to a bottle shouldn't require such frustration when you are trying to feed a hungry baby. Invest in Playtex Ventair instead!!!"
1,Leaky-leaky bottles!,"I have used my LAST Avent bottle. I can't tell you how frustrated I am over lost breastmilk that leaked out of these bottles. It seems that if you OVER-tighten or UNDER-tighten the bottle top, you end up with the contents leaking out - all over baby. There should be some kind of gasket inside the bottle collar. There is nothing but plastic on plastic. I thought these were supposed to be primo bottles as they were recommended by my birthing class instructor. Wrong. I have finally switched to ""drop-in"" liners and haven't lost a drop. Save your money!!"
2,Upset because they leak!!!,"I am so upset because I really wanted to use these bottles for my daughter. I heard such good things about them as far as the reduced air swallowing but those bottles just leak so much & I understand that if you keep untwisting & retwisting the cap that eventually it will stop leaking, but honestly who has time to deal with that?? I do not recommend these bottles to anyone! And this is not the first I've heard of this problem... Almost everyone I talk to that uses these has the same leaking problem! Has anyone let Avent know & are they going to try to fix it because I'd really like to use these with future children..."
3,Not Great,The bottles leak at the neck and the nipples became plugged after only a week of use. I expected a better product after the price I paid.
3,kinda frustrated,I recommend the product because of the way it works and how you can put different nipples as your child gets older. The problem is they always leak. Even the 4 oz bottles. No matter how much i reopen it and tighten the ring again it still leaks. Once a whole bottle leaked inside my diaperbag and all the diapers got wet. Prepare for complications.
1,Not for babies with gas or colic,I was very disappointed with the Avent system. We had my son on the bottles for almost 3 months. He had constant gas and colic which was very painful for him. At first we thought it was the formula; then by process of elimination we realized it was the bottles. We frequently upgraded on the nipple size up to stage 4- which became very pricey. He became so frustrated that he only ate in small amounts (1-2 ounces). After a recommendation from a friend we switched to Dr. Brown's. He is now eating normal amounts and is not gassy.
3,Great bottle but wet son,"I loved this the forst time I tried these bottles. I mostly breast feed and this bottle seemed to be the only one he took to. BUt I need to continue my search because he gets soaked as these DO LEAk. I have used them 3 times and since the second time he is soaked. I don't wash them in the dishwasher either. great nipple, bad leaking. Too bad!"
2,Not worth it...,"I bought these for my 2-week-old since I've heard many good things about them. I've had them for a week, and they leak like crazy. Today, one of the bottles toppled over in my diaper bag, and ALL 3 oz leaked out in a matter of minutes. I'm taking these back today and switching to something else. These are just way too overrated."
1,Avoid these - not worth the hassle,"My wife and I made the mistake of buying about $75 worth of AVENT products for our son. The nipples are HUGE butmore importantly, these bottles LEAK incessantly.I went to the website and read the FAQ regarding leakage and their (supposed) remedy. Tried their suggestions. Still had leakage. Called their Customer Service - they were very courteous and sent me 4 bottles. These too, LEAKED.You cannot tighten the ring too tight or the bottle leaks. If you do not tighten it JUST RIGHT, it still LEAKS. Extremely frustrating when your child is hungry and becomes upset when each time he/she tries to suck, they receive a face full of formula.We trashed all AVENT products and moved to Dr. Browns - have not had a single problem since. Avoid these like the plague.The design is seriously flawed."
2,A Leaky mess.,"I tried the Avent bottles for our twin sons. The lowest flow nipple was way too fast, and my sons would end up wearing half their meal. And we would frequently experience leaks from the nipple not creating a seal with the bottle. It was a mess. We switched to Dr. Brown's bottles. The boys love them, and they seem less gassy since we switched. At four months, we graduated to the level 2 nipple, and the boys took to it easily. I still occasionally use an Avent bottle to mix formula, because it is nicely shaped. But then I pour the formula into a Dr. Brown's bottle to feed the babies."
1,Baby Bottles & Nipple Starter 1 for newborns,"Being a first time mom,I bought this bottles thinking they were the best, but they are not. The nipple resembles the nipple of a breast it is very good, but the nipple hole seems too big for a newborn nipple, the milk comes out to fast, she almost chokes, that's how fast it comes out!!( It is suppose to be for newborns, I even bought a second batch of newborn nipples & still it came out too fast!!) I noticed she ate to fast, she made a lot of bubbles with this bottle, and got hiccups every time after her feeding and colics.. I bought a bottle called Dr. Brown & it is the best!!With this she ate slower, she no longer made any bubbles, she did not get hiccups everytime I feed her, and her colics have gotten better."
3,they leak!!,Just have to let you know... They leak. My baby is only two weeks old and these bottles are leaking all over him!! Poor guy. He ends up wet before he can even burp!!
4,**Great Bottles but can leak**,"Recently gave birth to my 2nd child and am using the Avent system again. I do occasionally experience the leakage that the other users have reported but nothing too extreme. All I have to do is loosen the lid and tighten it again and that seems to do the trick. I love the ergonomic design of the wide bottles and baby seems to love them! Overall, I think this is a great system. The Isis breast pump is awesome!"
1,Listen to the bad reviews!,"These bottles are horrible! I never listened to the bad because I thought that people didnt know how to use them properly, well I was wrong. I was getting so frustrated with them I threw most of them in the trash. Coming home with a soaked diaper bag is not fun at all. Go for the Playtex nurser system, they are the best bottles ever and probably always will be."
3,Great bottles if they work,"In 2000 when my first son was born, I bought the Avent bottles to go with my Isis breast pump (which I LOVE) because everyone raved about how they were the best. The first time my son tried the bottle with a newborn nipple he couldn't get anything to come out. After trying for awhile, I finally called Avent and they told me to move up to a different size nipple. These bottles worked out relatively well after that dilemma. With me second son I assumed I would use the bottles again and tried the newborn nipple with the opposite result. The flow was way too fast for him and he would choke and spit out half the milk every time I would try to feed him. I finally gave up on Avent bottles and went with the much cheaper and economical Evenflo Classic bottles (on the recommendation of the lactation consultant.)"
1,I wished they wouldn't leak,I really wanted to like these bottles because they are wide and they don't have any funny parts. But these things leak and leak. What a shame.
1,"Leaky, leaky, leaky","Everyone raved about these things as if they were the best thing since sliced bread, so I registered for them...then bought a bunch more myself. At roughly 4 bucks apiece, imagine my disgust to find that these things leak constantly!! I've spilled milk on my son and myself w/these bottles. I know other people have said that if you do everything correctly, they won't leak...in my opinion, if it's that much of an exact science to keep a product from leaking, then the product is not up to reasonable standards. I switched to cheap Evenflo bottles and never had a single problem with them. I wish I had my cash back for the Avent ones. I'd advise NOT using these or at the very least, only buy a few before making a decision on whether or not you like them. Believe me, if you have the leakage problems we had, you will be glad if you do."
2,Leaks and more leaks......,"I have been bottle feeding my son since he was born using the Avent bottles. After 6 weeks of constant leaks with these bottles, my husband and I had enough. The formula would soak my son during feedings and when we made the bottles we would lose half of the formula in the sink. We tried everything...putting the bottles together when wet, resealing them, different heating methods, ect. NOTHING worked. The nipples also seemed too large for my sons mouth. I would not recommend these bottles. We switched to the Dr. Brown's bottles which were well worth the money."
2,avent bottles,I have been nursing and am now switching our daughter to abottle. We've tried several different bottles and these were the ones my daughter will take. We have a terrible time with them leaking. Breastmilk is like gold to me and its very frustrating when I pull the bottle out of the diaper bag with half of it all over the bag!! We are currently trying different brands again.
1,leaky,I have been using all different brands of bottles and the Advent bottle is by far the worst. They leak from between the ring and the bottle itself. They should not be so sensitive to put together. Most mommies and daddies do not have to cottle the bottle into behaving like it should. Don't waste your money.
1,Nipples [not good]!,"After breastfeeding my baby girl, I decided to switch to a bottle and chose these because of their ""reputation"" of being ""good"". I would definitely not recommend them. She had more milk on her than in her! I have switched to the Playtex VentAire with great success."
2,Use with caution,I loved these bottles because of the shape. I thought my breastfed baby would make the switch easily. Was I wrong! They were too hard and the nipple was too long. She also seemed to choke a lot. Maybe the flow was too fast. We switched to another brand with a latex orthodontic nipple and she does fine. Buy a couple of different brands before you commit to one system.
1,Will the leaking ever stop?,I too like many other mothers were excited about using the Avent system. However I should have checked out recommendations for this product. I have read that many other people are having the same problems with the bottles leaking. My son is now three months old and I just can't deal with it any more. I have tried everything to stop the leaking but my efforts are useless. I have switched to another bottle.
2,avent bottles,"I recently had a baby boy and I purchased Avent bottles because I heard and read that they caused less air to enter the baby's stomach so I purchased them. I have not been pleased with these bottles because they leak. More milk has spilled on my baby's and my clothes during his feedings and I have never had that experience with any other bottles, therefore I am getting ready to purchase new bottles and they won't be Avent. I would like their customer service number to offically complain."
2,LEAKY BOTTLES,"These bottles leak all over you and the baby, it's easily the most annoying thing in the world. I am pregnant again and plan to purchase an entirely new set of bottles because it is extremely frustrating! I would not reccomend these bottles to anyone. The only plus about them is their size, the 9oz are shorter than others and the wide mouth is easier to fill."
5,best bottles ever,these bottles proved to be better than any other bottle. myb baby gets much less gas from these than any other on the market. its definately worth the price. i have bought and wasted money on so many different brands of bottles. dont waste your money and just go exclusivly with these.
2,Not worth the money!,"We had trouble using these bottles, the nipples (size one) were too fast for my baby. Every time she would swallow she was spitting formula out the sides of her mouth because she was getting to much. She was also coughing alot due to the speed of the formula coming out.In addition, we had bubbles galore in the bottles!We switched to another brand and we do not have any of these problems.Save your money and go with something else! Expensive is not always the best!"
2,Disappointed,"This message is for the mother that had spent a lot of money on Advent bottles. I, too, have purchased bottles and unfortunetly they are not helpful. The bottles are leaky and I find myself playing with the bottle to ensure it has been put on properly. This process consumes a lot of time, which in turns makes my little one upset for he is waiting to eat. When you hear a lot of great things about a product and invest in it, only to find out that it was not such a good idea."
5,Love these bottles,"I bought these bottles because my daugter has a problem burping. She seems to do well with this system and loves the pacifiers its the only one she will take. We tried the Playtex bottles only to find out she is alergic to laytex, so the Avent are a much better choice. I have yet to experince the problem with leaks but I only screw on the cap until it stops."
2,My boy never took a bottle...,"...I really wanted to get him used to the bottle so that I could leave him with my brother, and nothing else worked so I tried the Avent. Well, it didn't work either. My kid preferred the real thing. I guess the Avent doesn't work for everybody...."
5,THESE ARE REALLY GREAT BOTTLES!!!,THIS BOTTLE IS MY LIFE SAVER!! MY DAUGHTER STARTED OUT WITH PLAYTEX BOTTLES AND HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE. MILK RAN ALL DOWN HER FACE AND SHE HAD A LOT OF AIR BUBBLES. THE FIRST TIME I GAVE HER THIS KIND OF BOTTLE SHE HAD NO TUMMY TROUBLE AND THE MILK STAYED IN HER MOUTH. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ALL AVENT PRODUCTS!!
2,No good for us,These bottles were terrible for us. They leaked no matter how many times I tried and followed the directions. They also did not keep my daughter from being gassy. As soon as we changed her bottles to the Dr. Browns she slept through the night with no wake ups. I was not a big fan of these bottles and neither was my daughter.
1,Leak all the time.....,I am a first time Mom and I was told that Avent was the best for gas and colic. I hesitated since they are not cheap but who doesn't want the best for their baby so I bought them. They leak precious breastmilk that my baby should be drinking. The leaking would leave him hungry and so I would have to pump again. I went on various websites to see if there was a solution and the solution was don't screw it on so tight. Who has time to think about all that nonsense in the middle of the night when your baby is crying for food. I would not recommend these at all. What an utter waste of money!
1,"Here a leak, there a leak Everywhere a leak leak","I have been using these bottles for the past 6 weeks. I thought it was just me that my son was getting soaked in formula. But now that I read all the reviews, I find that most mothers are frustrated with loosing half of the formula to leaks, never mind the excessive amount of money you have to spend to get enough bottles to get through two days. No matter how well he latches onto the nipple, the formula spurts out of the side and down his chin. And making 6oz just so he can get 4oz in his little tummy is too expensive for me. I just wish I would have known all this before 16 bottles."
2,Nipple Rings,"I fell in love with the Avent bottles when I started working in the infant room at my work. But, the bottles never gave me any problems then. So when I found out I was pregant I went out and bought [price] worth of bottles and nipples. When I started to feed my newborn they would leak from the spacing between the bottle and ring. For the price that I paid for these bottles I would expect a better product."
1,Worst Bottle on the Market,I have triplet girls so I have become an expert on bottles we have at lease one of every kind on the market. I must say these are by far the worst bottles on the market. They leak at random and when they do they make a mess all over your baby or the diaper bag. They are expensive and there are many cheaper bottles on the market that are 100% better. Do not waste your money on this product
1,LEAK LEAK LEAK!!!,"These bottles are terrible~once you get comfy with baby and start feeding~they leak all over, then you & baby are soaked (and smelly~especially when on whole milk) and no longer relaxed. Terrible!!!"
2,what a mess!,These bottles leak. The formula just pours out of the sides. I just threw them all away and bought a new product. What a waste of money. And they are not even recycable
4,Great for nursing babies,"These bottles were recommended to me by the lactation consultants at my hospital. I needed to get my baby aquainted with bottles for daycare starting at 12 weeks. I used both the manual Avent hand pump (which was great) and an electric pump. I started the bottle at 4 weeks. Both of my babies transitioned well back and forth between breast and the Avent bottles for 1 year. I did notice some leaking of the bottles when traveling with them, so I strted to use the small cap inserts. Once I was ready to use the bottle, I would put the nipple on."
2,Leaky!,"These bottles were great at first, but after only a few months, they started to leak horribly!! I went to the website and it says to change the nipples every 3 months, which we did...but they still leak. We have tried everything to get them to stop...screwing the nipples on tighter, etc. I would still say that 2 out of 3 times they leak...and I mean LEAK!! Like puddle on the floor, milk all over baby's face, neck, clothes kind of leak. My son is almost a year old, so he can hold his own bottle. Sometimes in the middle of the night if he gets up and I feed him, I can't see that it's leaking all over him and I don't realize it until he starts screaming!!I think I might have to switch bottles if I don't get an answer from Avent that I am doing something wrong.I would suggest looking into another type of bottle."
1,Hard Nipple,I breastfeed my daughter and she has never accepted the Avent nipple when she gets a bottle. It is very hard and she could not get a good latch. I tried the Playtex Nurser bottles and she did very well with them. They are much softer.
2,could be better,"I started my second child out on these, while they were easy for him to take, and not a complicated system, they still had way too much air inside!! which caused gas and left him fussy!!!! I switched to dr. brown and they are 100% better!!!"
1,Newborn nipples?,"My daughter was a month early and I am having problems breast feeding so I got these bottles with special ""newborn"" nipples. This was a big mistake, the flow is way too strong for a premie baby and was pouring out of the bottle all over her and they made her very gassy too. They may be good for older babies (2-3 months) but not for a newborn."
3,Disappointed,"My girlfriend recommended these bottles for my fourth baby. I had always used Playtex bottles with great success when transitioning from breast to bottle. Unfortunately, that was not the case with Avent. I found that my newborn sucked in too much air, and the lack of flow control on the nipple didn't help - I had never had a child spit up so much and so often. I found myself nursing him after a bottle feed. Thankfully the Avent was a ""loaner"" item from a friend and I have now replaced all the bottles with Playtex."
3,Not that thrilled,"I decided to use these because I wanted the Avent Breast Pump and would use these with it. Well, my newborn had a hard time latching onto the nipples and when he did they were way too fast with the flow. He would choke and gasp almost everytime. I now use the Playtex Ventaire bottles and he doesn't have as much of a problem. Every baby is different, though, but if you have a baby that tends to want to eat quickly, these won't work so well."
2,Very Disappointed,"I registered for these because many of my friends use them with their children. I found that these bottles repeatedly leaked from under the caps, even when I had my husband tighten them. They would be fine when they were inverted for feeding but would leak quite a bit when I would flip them over to put them down. The nipples were too long and would make my daughter gag. I also couldn't seem to get the correct flow from the nipple either. Even with the medium flow nipple, it would take my daughter around a half hour to get about an ounce out of it. I switched to the Playtex bottles with the NaturaLatch nipples and have seen a huge improvement. She latches onto the Playtex nipple much more easily and the bottle doesn't leak. The only advantage I have seen to the Avent bottle is that there is no repeat cost for the disposable liners."
4,Nice bottles but some problems,"I bought these since I was going to breastfeed my son. The problem is that my son couldn't breastfeed due to low suction and a poor latch. SInce these are so like the breast, he couldn't latch onto these bottles either. He got a lot of air and gas from them. They do leak if they are not assembled when they are damp. (The leak comes from the collar, not the nipple.) I also found that they sometimes spray formula when they are tipped over. My son had problems with the #2 nipple with formula running out the sides of his mouth but unable to continue with the #1 since the hole was too small. They're great to have if your child can latch on correctly."
2,Not what I expected,"I researched and asked a lot of questions before buying bottles. Everyone told me how much they loved the Avent bottles, so I bought them. Even the stage 1 nipples were too fast for my baby when she was in her first weeks. She ended up with more formula on her face, chin, and bib than in her tummy. I put them away and tried again later, and the nipples just seem too big for her mouth. I'm not that impressed. We're using the Playtex Vent Aire now, but I think the Parents Choice Wal-Mart kind are just as good!"
2,Not good for breast fed baby,"I got this 3 pack for a shower gift thinking I could use them for my son for the occasional bottle he would need. Avent advertises these bottles as being good to use in conjunction with breastfeeding, and they were terrible for my son. The milk leaks out of his mouth, because he cannot latch on like the breast. If you are looking for a bottle to use with breastfeeding, the Playtex nursers are the best. We switched to that, with the NaturaLatch nipple, and it works great. The nipple is softer, he's able to latch better, and is less gassy(another problem I had with Avent). A bonus to the playtex nursers is that you can store your breastmilk in the bags, with little mess. Much better than Avent."
4,GREAT.......BUT,"At first I wanted to breastfeed, but my son had trouble latching on, so I had to pump, I originally wanted to use Playtex bottles with the bags, but then my son had trouble latching onto them, so I went with Avent. Wonderful bottle, my son suck like a pro with these because the nipple is longer and hit the roof of his mouth. HOWEVER the leak TERRIBLY!!!!!!!!! I would tighten the lids, and they would leak, I would loosen them, thinking they were overtightened, they would leak. I love the bottles, but the leaking made me change more outfits then I would have had to!!!! Hopefully with our next baby Avent will have fixed this problem.....if not I will have to change brands!!!!!!"
4,Great bottles for the price,I purchased these bottles for my older baby who drinks more than 9 oz at night. These work well for us because we don't have to refill them as often and the nipples work on his trainer sippy cups from avent.
3,They are okay.,"My daughter liked bottles. We liked them, too, but they did leak sometimes, and they also have BPA in them. If I'm going to pay this much for any bottles, I want them to be BPA-free, or at least not leak. We just got Sassy Mam bottles which are almost the same price and BPA free, plus good for colicky symptoms as well. I also love the Playtex ventaire advanced bottles which are really good quality bottles and are also for less fussing, spitting up, gas, etc. and my daughter enjoys them too, but they are not BPA free either. We keep these only for back up bottles now. The avent bottles- we wound up tossing all of them completely. not really worth the price."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I used these with my first child and LOVED them. They are easy to clean and assemble, comfortable to hold, vented great and reduceded the reflux my first son suffered from. We recently had our second child and I bought several new Avent bottles to use with him. I just threw them all away and bought another brand of bottle. This time around these bottles leaked horribly, the slowest nipple is too fast and caused our new baby to choke and swallow way to much air. My recomendation would be to buy one of several different kinds of bottles and decide which works best for your baby."
2,Too many leaks!,"I haven't found that they are worth the money. It seems like no matter what I do, they leak. Most of the time I don't realize that they have leaked until the front of my baby is soaked. I screw the tops on tighter and they leak; I loosen the top and they still leak. I can't win! The problem for me is that I have so many of them that I can't bring myself to invest in another product.I also have one Dr. Brown's brand bottle that I received as a gift, which doesn't leak at all, but has lots of other parts that you have to deal with. If I had to recommend any brand of bottle, it would probably be that one."
3,Frustrated with the Leaks,"My daughter did wonderful switching between breast and bottle with Avent. However, I am so frustrated with the leaks. I have to screw and unscrew the top multiple times with a screaming baby in my arms. Even then it sometimes leaks. I heard how great these bottles were, I wish I would have known about this ahead of time. The next baby will use a different brand!"
2,not the best bottle out there,"I have used three different bottle for my 3 month old son now. He gets horrible gas and avent bottles are supposed to help with that, but for me they dont. ALso they leak all the time. The only good thing about them is that unlike the plytex bottles i use now, the avent bottles have several stages of nippples so there is always one that is the perfect speed for your baby. Personally i have had more luck with the playtex ventaire bottles and the playtex nursers. They allow less air to get in babys belly, but they only 2 nipple stages, fast and slow. Its good to register for several differnt bottles and let your baby decide which ones are right for them!"
2,"Not for all babies, there is no ""best brand""","Not for my unhappy colic infant. My advice to all moms, try an asortment of brands before stocking up. I got the starter kit, and it simply is not the bottle for my baby! And I hate that i can't assemble a bottle at 3am without leaking!"
3,Avent Bottles,"I bought the Avent bottles for my first child, after reading so much about them in magazine adds. While I believe the bottles significantly reduced gas, I am so annoyed with the leaking. I have used every method possible, and I am still finding that it can take me upwards of 10 attempts to get the top on properly. It's very frustrating, particularly at 2am in the morning. I am expecting another baby and will strongly consider the use of another bottle. My bottles also went from a nice clear plastic, and now they look ""foggy"". Not sure if that's from too many dishwasher cycles. I truly believe that these bottles are one of the better options available, but it is incredibly frustrating when they leak."
2,Did not like,"I had heard wonderful things about the avent bottles. My son did not like them at all. He had much more gas when he used these bottles. I loved the avent breast pump and other avent products but the bottles did not live up to the ""less gas"" advertising. I switched to the airvent bottles with #2 nipples and he did much better."
1,waste of money,I hate these avent bottles!! i spent so much money on them and when i feed my baby with these bottles all the milk comes out of her mouth and onto her bib.
1,The Rolls Royce of Bottles? . . . I Think Not!,"I was told that these bottles were the ""Rolls Royce"" of bottles, and I read a number of reviews about the Avent feeding system in several parenting magazines. Unfortunately, I bought into the hype and spent a great deal of money on these bottles and the Avent slow flow rate nipples. I had to call the company to get advice on how to get the bottles to stop leaking and how to get the milk to stop leaking from my newborn's mouth. After following their tips, I was able to get the bottles to stop leaking, but I still have not mastered their tips on how to get the milk to stop leaking from the sides of my newborn's mouth (her lips are curled outward, according to their instructions, but much of my baby's milk still ends up on her bib). I am now experimenting with other feeding systems to see how quality bottles should perform. I would not recommend these bottles for any reason at all."
2,"Yes, they LEAK","When they don't leak they are fine but you don't know if you have ""screwed it on wrong"" until you tip it over and it leaks down your arm or worse yet all over your baby.It's not that I or any of these other people are too stupid to know how to screw it on - it just happens! So I do like the wide mouthed bottles but I would be more inclined to tell others to try another brand (I have no experience with other brands). I had so many that I could not see changing our whole feeding system. Only about 3 more months to go and I will be happy when he is using a sippy or regular cup! :-)"
2,don't care for these!,"The nipples are very hard on these bottles, and my son cannot latch on well to them. He can feed just okay with them, but a bunch of leakage comes out the sides of his mouth. I thought maybe the nipple was too fast, but months later, still the same problem. (...)"
2,"LEAKY - terribly, leaky - even the new ones","Some of my Avent bottles leak, and some don't. My baby likes the shape and won't take any other shape (WAL MART made a great knock-off around 1999 - 2000, but don't make that model anymore, and the knock-off's did NOT leak, I still have them). Sometimes I can get one lid to fit a particular bottle without leaking, and I try to mark the lid and bottle with matching nail polish so that I can get an exact, no-leak match. But what a hassle! And the markings eventually wear off. I'm on baby 3, so I've got plenty of experience when I say these LEAK. I give it two stars, because the baby likes the shape."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I would not recommend the Avent bottles at all. Not only is the base of the bottle too wide for infants to even hold, the caps leak. After only a few attempts of using these, I switched to the VentAire by Playtex which have been wonderful. Don't waste your time with these. All of mine are going in the garbage."
1,What a mess!,"Of course we wanted the best for our son. I read all reviews, compaired all brands, did my homework. Never thought I would have such a big mess using the Avent bottles. My son was a month early so he was smaller than normal (6lbs 6oz-if that is small). From the first feeding he got way to much formula and half the bottle ended up down the front of him. Not because the bottle leaked, but because he couldn't handle the flow and was spitting it out. I was horrified! After two weeks of trying, and it not getting better, I looked for another bottle and ended up with a much cheaper bottle and NO SPILLS! I have no complaints about the bottle itself - the flow is just to much for my baby (yes, I was using ""#1"" nipples). What a disappointment! I will give it another try in the future when he is older...wish me luck!"
2,LEAKS LIKE CRAZY,I should have read the reviews on this bottle before I registered for them. I too planned on breastfeeding and was told this was the best for switching back and forth between breast and bottle. I also had to stop breatfeeding and go to the bottle 100%. I've tried every angle and no matter what these bottles leak like mad. Most of the formula ends up down the side of my daughters face or in her bib. Additionally my daughter takes in to much air and has constant issues with gas. I am now looking for a different bottle. Do your research because it can save you a lot of frustration and money.
2,leaks,"The Avent bottles leak terribly. I would not recommend buying them to anyone. It is hard enough waking up in the middle of the night to feed, but add in getting all wet (me and baby). It isn't just me who has had this problem, which I initially thought. I have asked several people if this has happened to them and it has. We've even tried purchasing new nipples, thinking it was that, and it didn't matter. The bottles seem to have a defect, according to a friend who used to use them years ago and NEVER had the problem then (but NOW does)."
3,"Leaky, but Likeable","I love the feel of this bottle. My son is a monster and guzzles down everything. We found that the natural shaped nipples work better for his eating habits than those tiny things. I had no problem with the 4oz bottles, but the 9oz ones seem to leak like crazy. I find that if they leak at first, if you unscrew the cap, turn it counter clockwise until you hear 2 clicks and then screw it back on they don't leak anymore. I found the Playtex VentAir Natural Shape bottles to be comparable in shape and size and they don't leak."
1,Too Leaky,I was experimenting with different bottle options for my son. I had several platex bottles with liners and was looking for a more economical choice. I was hoping to find a good bottle that did not require a liner. I purchased a package of avent bottles and was happy for the first few days. On the fourth day the bottle began leaking horribly. By the end of the week 2 of the 3 bottles were leaking and the 3rd began to leak the next week. I followed all cleaning instructions. The bottles were never put in the microwave or dishwasher. I do not recommend this bottle. They are too expensive for the quality.
1,"leaks,leaks,leaks","I had my third child 9 months ago and i am expecting my fourth and I would not recommend these bottles to anyone ever.After struggling with nipple problems in the beginning and talking to the avent people over and over again I finally got It down to where I could screw the cap on and prevent leaks, however whenever any one else feeds my baby the whole bottle of formula leaks all over her.I find that if I do not explain in detail the unique way of screwing on the caps than the whole bottle proceeds to trickle down the front of her clothes before anyone notices.These bottles are just too much work for me unfortunately my daughter will not take any other bottle at this point in time but believe me I will not be using these bottles for the new baby! I have alot of feeding experience so I know its not me and I wouldn'tcare if they cost ten dollars a bottle as long as they don't leak! ""bad investment!"""
1,Do Not Buy!!!!!! LEAK LEAK LEAK,"These bottles are the worst bottles because of the leaking!! They leak all over you and the baby no matter how the lid is put on, AND you shouldn't even have to worry about if you even put the lid on so precisly right. I mean it shouldn't be rocket science here makers of AVENT! SO my recommendation is NO don't waste your $$"
2,I Can't Stand These Leaking Bottles!,"Yes, my experience with the Avent bottles is echoed by many. We have had alot of trouble with these bottles leaking. No matter what we do we end up having to put the lid on 2-3 times before we can get them not to leak. Spend your money on a bottle that won't leak!"
1,Leaks!,"As stated in previous reviews, this bottle leaks. Luckily I only got one as a sample,but I figured I would try it. Even put together properly, it leaks. I will stick to my Dr Brown's and Playtex Ventaire"
2,Drippy bottles,"I have owned many types of bottles in my years of foster parenting infants and with my 4 kids. These were very nice in the beginning. A bit stiffer than others, but they worked ok. After a few months I started to get the drippies. I thought the baby was not sealing well and watched more carefully. It was the bottle. It seems after a few trips through the dishwasher they just didnt' seal up right. One never did seal right and I pitched it, I tried other nipples first, but it was the bottle. It seems the tight ones don't let the air back in very well and create that vacuum and the ones that do release air drip some."
2,leaky bottles,These bottles used to leak for me but I figured out the problem. I was tightening the rings too tight. Just tighten them enough so their not too loose and not too tight. This should fix the problem. It did for me. I would give them five stars now that they don't leak any more.
4,Other than the Leaking they are perfect,"My daughter was born 3 & 1/2 weeks early and had to stay at the hospital for a week, she was lazy at the breast but did great with these bottles which came highly recommended by a friend. I only have an ocassional problem with leakage when you twist it shut it seems that every 1 in 10 times it leaks. I don't mind the leaking except that it takes several tries to re-twist it before it stops leaking. I hate losing precious breastmilk to leaks, thats why I gave it only 4 stars."
2,gave my daughter very very very bad gas,"when i became pregnant i planned on using these bottles, i bought everything bottle warmer,sterilizer,breast pump, and a ton of bottles and nipples. well 2 weeks into using them i threw them out the window. my daughter had very bad gas. when i switched bottles the gas stopped. Plus the bottles are expensive......you have to keep buying new nipples there are sooo many different sizes. a waste i think, most bottles have 2 fast or slow but there seemed to be 4 different sizes or more."
1,"I agree with Wendy, Avent Bottles DO NOT WORK!!!","I thought that the Avent bottles were the best, but I was so wrong. Being a new mother and having your son crying in one and then trying to fix a leaking bottle with the other hand, can be a little nerve recking.It very tricky trying to screw the cap on the proper way. You can not tell if the cap is on the right way until you turn it up side down and it leaks every where."
2,Stores better than feeding!,"The bottles are great for storing food, breast milk, and formula if you use the lids with sealer, but for feeding, they tend to leak on the side from the lids. So watch out! You might be doing more laundry then intended. As for the disposable bottle feeding system, these work much better for feeding, because the lids don't leak."
3,Soakin' Baby,"The Avent bottles were recommended to me by my cousin. She did warn me about the leaking problem with these bottles. Even when I think I have the cap on correctly, the formula leaks out of the bottle soaking my daughter. Several times, while in my bottle bag, the formula has seeped out leaving me with an empty bottle and a pool of formula in my bag.......very frustrating and messy!!! On a happier note, I am also currently using the microwave sterilizer and bottle warmer put out by Avent and I'm quite satisfied with both products."
2,Leaky & Frustrating,"We started using this system when our son was born. He is now three months old. We have stopped using them because they leak every time. We were very excited to try the AVENT system, and very disappointed after the first month when the bottles were leaking. It is a great thought, but we were unable to fix the problem."
2,"These nipples ARE NOT like ""MOM""","Who on this planet has nipple like these?! They were a trick to get my son to properly latch onto. The milk has been leaking steadily out of his mouth while feeding since birth!! I thought all bottles did this! My wet clothes and rags can testify! They are just too stiff. I have had the leaking problems also. Every where we go - I have taken premixed bottles and warmed them while out - but they have leaked in the diaper bag, in my purse and in my hand. I have taken sep. containers of formula and water and mixed when he is ready to feed = still flying formula everywhere and it's getting annoying and embarrassing. We have switched to Dr. Brown's."
1,LEAKS!,"These bottles are not worth the money. I have been using them for about five months and they have always leaked a little bit. Now they leak constantly every time I go to feed the baby. You would be better off with something else, the Plaxtex Vent Aire works great."
2,these bottles leak,"I got these bottles based on the reviews on this site, and they ended up leaking. It was very frustrating. I went to the store to buy a new type of bottle and another mother shopping for new bottles had the same problem, so it wasn't just the set that I had boughten."
1,dripping nightmare,These are the worst bottles I have ever bought! All they do is drip and leak. I have tried over and over again and no matter how I put the lids and nipples on they leak. Since I am pumping the last thing I want to do is waste my milk. If I had to do it all over again I would not waste my money on these bottles.
1,Leaky Mess,"I bought these thinking that they would be an easy transistion to breast feeding my twins. I could not have been more wrong. The bottles were nothing but a leaky mess. I nipples & lids would not seal right. After a week I gave up and went with the playtex nurser. The liners are a bit of a hassle, but well worth not getting drenched every feeding. I used the playtex disposables with my first baby and they worked great then. I don't know why I tried something different. I should have stuck with what I knew worked."
1,"Leaks, leaks, leaks","I bought these bottles after trying the Playtex Nurser system and the Vent Air system. I've had nothing but problems with them. They leak everywhere, and being a new mother, I don't have the time to spend 5 or 10 minutes just trying to get a bottle made. I've followed the instructions and consulted with Avent, but the bottles still leak. The only positive thing I have to say about these bottles is they do seem to reduce if not eliminate gas.Overall, I would NOT recommend these bottles to anyone who doesn't have a lot of patience."
3,"Great shape design, but watch out for the leaks!","I read reviews on these bottles that indicated that they leak. I went against my gut feeling and purchased them for my newborn son. He is only one month old and I am regularly having problems with leaks. I have found that if the bottles are even the least little bit wet from cleaning they will not seal. Even after hand drying I have still had instances where I couldn't get them to seal. My son feeds well from them; much better than from the Gerber straight bottles, but dealing with the leaks has been very frustrating."
2,Not What I Had Hoped For!,"We are new parents. Our son was born 10 weeks ago and we did a TON of research for baby products before he was born. We decided on the Avent bottles for many reasons. They are really not that bad, but I have to disagree with all of the glowing reviews. My son has been diagnosed with Reflux and these bottles did NOT help! He has all kinds of gas, etc. And these bottles leak like crazy. We tried tightening and everything, but to no avail. We heard about the Dr. Brown's bottles that prevent gas and air flow and they REALLY work. And the Dr. Brown's don't leak and they have soothed my baby SO MUCH. No wicked gas pains in the middle of feeding. Just big huge burps and happy smiles! I wanted the Avent to be better but you can't always get what you want!"
1,AVENT BOTTLES,"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. THE BOTTLES ALWAYS LEAK AND ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING. I BOUGHT THESE BOTTLES THINKING THEY WERE THE BEST,BUT OBVIOUSLY I WAS WRONG. I EVEN SEEKED THE HELP OF THEIR WEBSITE WHICH ALSO WAS NO HELP REGARDING THIS ISSUE."
1,"Gas, Gas, and More Gas!","When I tried these bottles I was very unhappy. After every feeding my baby had terrible gas. The newborn nipple holes are so big my baby kept choking. My daughter is now six weeks old and she cannot use the stage 2-1 Month nipples because the newborn nipple holes are still to big for her. These bottles also leak. While I was feeding my baby, milk was leaking from the neck of the bottle all over her. Also, if these bottles tip over the milk will leak right out. I had them in the diaper bag and the diaper bag tipped over and the milk leaked everywhere."
1,leaking problem!!!!,These bottles leak no matter how tight you twist them. The milk gets all over me and my baby. I know others that have the same problem! I do not recommend these bottles!
3,Not too happy,"My husband and I were happy with these bottles during the first stages of when my son was born after I stopped nursing. However, once you change the nipples to the next feeding stage, they leak. No matter how tight I make the top it still leaks."
1,Save your money,"I thought Avent bottles were the best on the market, so I requested and received 18 of them (not including the 9oz.bottles I received). I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. For one, the bottles leaked from the collar, resulting in more formula on the bib than in her stomach. Secondly, the bottle allowed for a lot of air to enter her belly, resulting in painful gas after feedings. In addition, there always seemed to be a lot of spit up ( I initially thought maybe it was my daughter not latching on well enough, but since switching to Dr. Brown's bottles, there has not been any spit up or gas at all. I highly recommend Dr. Brown's bottles."
2,Just an OK bottle,"I haven't had the leaking problems that some complain of, but I'm just not wild about these bottles. Too fat. I find slimmer bottles more comfortable to feed with and easier for baby to hold when they are ready. Also make sure that your bottlewarmer and other items will work with these thicker bottles. My bottlewarmer I used with my first baby doesn't work with these bottles."
4,Pretty good bottle,"These bottles are pretty good. The nipple is a little large and seems to flow kinda fast for my breastfed baby. She makes quite a mess while drinking from these. However, the bottle is nice and durable. The nipple and caps fit snug. Also, they work great as breast milk storage containers. You can take out the nipple and put the insert in the cap for freezer storage. I like that. My daughter doesn't get a bottle often, but when she does this in one of the types I use."
3,A bottle better used as a sippy cup!,"My child is six months old and is a very picky baby she would only take the Gerber New Traditions and Evenflo Elite nipples on her bottles until she started taking a sippy cup just recently, when we discovered the Advent bottle and sippy cup system. She absolutely LOVES the sippy cup attachment that you buy to fit these bottles. The only down fall is that she has reflux and takes rice cereal in her formula and it is so thick it will not come through the nipple even the fastest flow nipple and the type of nipples that it will come through do not fit this bottle. Over all this is wonderful bottle to use as a sippy cup but not a bottle."
1,Two thumbs down to Philips Avent (and Amazon.com),"This is my second review concerning these lousy bottles (my first has been inexpicably 'removed' by Amazon.com). So, for the sake of brevity, I will keep it short: These bottles are not worth your money. Having years of experience working in the production/manufacturing industry and on similar packaging/storage containers, I can safely say that the fault with the serious leak issue lies with the design, production and/or quality control (at manufacturer level of course).Simply put, the bottle's threads (and possibly it's seal where the nipple is seated) need to be re-engineered. Spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere, folks...these aren't worth the frustration or the money."
2,leaky and too slow of a flow.,"i was pumping for my daughter when she was born and used these bottles and they were great for storage and easy conversion to a bottle, however the milk leaked out of her mouth all over the place and breast milk is precious. i wasted alot and ended up switching to another bottle. also the flow was too slow on the stage 1 and too fast on stage 2 for her as a newborn. it took almost 25min for her to finish 3-4oz. while it only took 10 or so with a standard bottle. Easy for starge to bottle conversion though.i do not recomend these bottles."
1,Avent = Gas problem,"I started using these bottles prior to going back to work, wanting a bottle similar to the (...). My daughter took the nipple, no problem. I didn't have a problem with leaks...as everyone else noted, you just screw the nipple ring on lightly and assemble the nipple and ring while wet...that's all it takes. I do however have a problem now with terrible gas build up in the evenings and gas noises that make my husband blush!!! . You moms know the screams of a baby with gas build-up...it's awful. I had been using gas drops, but wanted a solution and not a quick fix. I switched to the Dr. Brown's bottles and she hasn't had the painful gas since!!!"
3,"My son loved these, but had problems....","We used these bottles right from the beginning (our son had troubles nursing) and our son loved them! Our son experienced some pretty bad days of gasiness, but overall, no real problems. We did have a lot of issues with the bottles leaking and found that having to change nipple sizes was a bit annoying. A variable flow nipple would have been much easier than having to switch between nipples with different numbers of holes. These were much easier to use than the Avent disposable bottles, which tended to leak and didn't allow me to push the air out. Our son was able to hold these bottles by himself when he was about 6 months old, so that was a real benefit, and we also used the sippee adaptor on them which really extended the life of the bottle!"
1,They Leak. Plain and Simple.,I have called Avent many times. I have even visited their representatives at a baby faire to complain about these bottles. They showed me how to cap them so they don't leak. First of all you should not have to go through this much trouble to put a cap on this expensive of a bottle. Second of all it still only works about 35% of the time (it basically involves using the cover to do it).What a nightmare. I know at least three people who use these and have the same problems. I have riuned countless diaper bags and forula becuase of these. Now I keep them all in ziplock bags. When I pull them out aout half of the water is still in there and half is in the bag.
2,Do Not Like Avent Bottles - Love the Sippy Cups,"I bought these because Baby Bargains' book stated that these bottles were the top of the line. I had nothing but problems with them. They constantly leaked when mixing or trying to feed. They did nothing to prevent gas in my child. I was disappointed with these bottles. I traded in the ones I had not used and switched over to the Playtex disposables. They do not allow air to get into them because you can burp the liners and they have yet to leak on me. I am now starting to use the Avent sippy cups with my son, who is 7 1/2 months old. I love these, but I was really disappointed in the bottles, since all the books I read stated that they were supposed to be the best bottles out there. In my opinion, that was farthest from the truth."
2,There are better options,"I had no feeding issues with my son. The issues were with the bottle. If you don't screw the lid on just right, it leaks. And in the begining you're really tired, so it's just not worth it. I bought a ton of these bottles because I was told they are the best. My opinion is that they are trendy - there are other cheaper options. I suggest you buy a few different brands and see what works best for you."
2,"Very Popular, but their are drawbacks...",I choose these bottles because they are very popular but then realized that the size of them are so large that the baby never really seems to be able to get a good hold on them. I started bottle feeding at 6 months and ended up having to switch and buy an entire new line. After my son turned 1 began to wean him off the bottle and introduced the avent bottles again just to see if he could hold it and it was still way to large for him..... I guess these bottles would work if you plan on bottle feeding a toddler with big hands
1,Bad Product,"AVENT bottles leak. Not only do they leak, but the nipples are hard and not like mommy's breast. One other problem we found is that despite repeated cleaning and sterilizing these bottles maintained the plastic smell. We also use Dr. Brown's bottles and they work wonderfully to reduce gas, but there is a number of little parts to clean - well worth it though if you have a gassy baby."
1,Horrible!!!,"These bottles were a ""first time mom"" nightmare. The nipple did not form a seal around my childs mouth and formula leaked out. She would then cry out of hunger. It was a never ending battle. (Until I purchased a Playtex product that solved all my problems) I also contacted the Avent Company and shared how unhappy I was and they told me in no uncertain terms that it wasn't their problem and refused to help me! I will never buy another Avent product."
1,Warning-leaky bottles,"I as many mothers did my research ino which bottles are the best and I read about all the wounderful things that the avent bottles do for the baby. I started to notice that the bottles were leaking. I thought maybe it's that particular one so I threw it away, only to realize it wasn't the bottle, it was all of them. When I contacted avent, they told me that if the bottles are over tightened or if the nipple isn't assembled with the cap when it was wet that the will leak. I don't know about you but a 2am I don't want to be changing my two week old because her bottle leaked all over her. Please keep this in mind when looking at bottles."
3,Bottle fed Baby,"I purchased a lot of these bottles after reading several great reviews, however my son just doesn't like the nipple. He was in the NICU for several weeks and got very used to the nipple used at the hospital. The only bottle he takes well is the gerber bottle that costs about a $1. Now he is having a lot of gas problems and I am desperate to find a better bottle for him with a similar nipple. I hope as he gets older he will get used to these bottles. In the many attempts I have had in using the Avent bottles, I have not had any leaking problems like so many others."
2,Extra gas and fussiness..,After giving my Daughter just one avent bottle she was more fussy and gassy than she has ever been! I love the shape and everything of the bottle but my Daughter did not care for the nipple at all. She does much better with playtex nurser.
3,Leaking Bottles,My son is 3 months old and has been using the Avent bottles since he was 4 weeks old. Initially I thought $13 for three bottles was outrageous but with the ease of use it was worth every penny. Recently with the 9oz bottles I have noticed them leaking. They leak when I shake the bottle to mix the formula and leak when I feed my son. It wasn't until I read the customer reviews that I learned other moms have encountered the same problem. I didn't realize that I may be tighten the bottles too much. Has it worked for others? I hope so. I've already spent $45 on bottles and hope I don't have to find an alternative.
3,disappointing,"I'm breastfeeding but bought the bottles because I'm pumping. I chose avents on high recommendations that they are most like the breast. I didn't have problems with leaks. I never over tighten them either which is the cause of the leaking. Even using the newborn nipple, my 1 month old would get drowned in formula. Switched to playtex which she now prefers. Buy one type of bottle and nipple first for your baby to try before listening to any recommendations."
2,Many Leaks!,I purchased these bottles only because I had planned to breast feed and I had done research that the Avent brand was excellent when switching back and forth from breast feeding to bottle feeding. I was unable to breast feed so I am using the Avent full time. For the first few weeks they were fine but we have had a lot of problems with leaking. Its very frustrating! Sometimes we have to change our sons clothes because formula has leaked down the front of him. We really only keep using them because we received so many at our baby shower.
5,"Avent Great, Leaking Cure","I used Avent bottles with my son who was breast fed and he never had any problem switching between bottle and breast. I chose Advent because of recommendations that they are best for supplementing formula. I did have a temporary problem with leaking, though. My husband started making the bottles and screwed the lids on very tight. The bottles began to leak when they never had before so we began tightening the lids even more, but still they leaked. The cure for leaking: after much experimentation we discovered that if you screw the lids on too tight, they will leak! BUT, if you screw them on gently where the nipple isn't pressed too hard into the lid, they never leak. We haven't had a leak problem since. Hope this helps!"
4,Work fine for me,"I have been using these bottles for my 5 month old since she was born. She was breastfed for the first 2 1/2 months, but we always supplemented or pumped. Now she is exclusivly bottle fed.I did have a problem with them leaking a few times ( as did my sister in law ) , but I just unscrewed the top and screwed it back on , and everything was fine . Another time , the nipple had cracked and the formula was pouring out, but a new nipple ( upgraded to a 3 mth+) fixed that problem. This is my first baby and the only bottles I have ever used , so I don't have much to compare to, but I have been happy with them so far and have just purchased my first Avent cup for my DD."
1,LEAKS!!!!!,I just wanted to let anyone out there that was told that these bottles were the best that that's not true. They are constantly leaking. The milk spills out and makes a huge mess. Then as your child is screaming for the bottle you have to try and fix the leak( which I found to be inpossiable) or switch nipples. What an ordeal! I would not recommend these bottles to anyone!
2,Way too over-rated,"I bought into all the hype that Avent was the only way to go so I gave it a try and I wasn't really satisfied with the bottle system. They say the nipples are shaped like mom and good for switching from bottle to breast but my son didn't take to the stiff shape. The nipple is really hard compared to others. Also, no matter how we screwed the lid on, we always had leaks. The third thing that made me throw them out was the fact that they are so BIG. At my son's day-care most of the parents brought Avent bottles and they take up way too much room in the little fridge. So we tried the Munchkin health-flow (used to be Johnson & Johnson's) and we're much happier! Not too mention they were too expensive."
1,Leaky!!!,"These bottles leak terribly, if you don't take the time to make sure you put the tops on &quot;just right&quot;. Who wants to fuss around with that during those all-night feedings??!! After 3 weeks of trying, these are going in the garbage. I've never had that problem with other cheaper brands of bottles, so for the price you pay,why bother?"
3,"Leaks, leaks and leaks","Yes, we too have experienced leaks with the Avents. We've tried to figure it out- Is it the plastic ring? Is the nipple fully inserted? Is it not screwed on properly? Is it a combo of all of these things? Should it REALLY be this difficult???? I've had Avents leak all inside my diaper bag (didn't realize it until I smelled the sour formula), all down my sons chin and neck, and all over the floor. We still use ours because I hate to waste money, but we have thrown a few away thinking THEY were the faulty ones... only to have other faulty ones crop up. (My husband refuses to use the Avents now and only uses Dr. Browns.) I think it may be a combo of the Avent nipple not sealing (make sure you really, really insert it well), and the ring not being screwed on right (check and double check), but in the end it's like that one sock that always gets lost in the dryer. What could be the mystery problem??"
1,LEAKY!!!,"These bottles are certainly NOT worth the money. They leak if you don't screw them just right! After buying dozens of these bottles in 4oz. and 9oz. because I wanted the best for my newborn and I thought these were the best, I was very upset about the loss of money as they are expensive. Eight out of ten times I used the bottle, it leaked. After the bottle leaked warm milk all over my newborn's face, my husband and I had had enough. I called customer service to complain and spend about ten minutes listening to the rep. tell me about how to screw the top on just right. It's just not worth it!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good enough,"I was given Avent bottles as a shower gift and used them quite soon after my son was born. I had no problems with the bottles at all until I bought replacement nipples for faster feeding. After a couple months of use I found that when I put the bottle together and turned them upsidedown, they would leak. This wasn't just a freak occurance. This happened almost regularly. If I had to do it all over again I probably would not have registered for Avent bottles but something else. They do the job and since my son is closer to a sippy cup I'm not going to buy a different brand. I probably would recommend registering or buying a different brand for all soon-to-be moms out there."
5,LEAKS!,"These bottles were recommended to me because I wanted to be able to switch from bottle to breast and back again, and they work great for that. I did have trouble with the bottle leaking from time to time, but I read the directions which state that the nipples must be wet when you put the bottle together, so I just tip the bottle, twist the cap off and right back on, and I'm good to go."
2,Very unhappy with leaks,"Initially this bottle was the best and it worked fine, until it started leaking. I am still not able to figure out why it leaks but it does and it drives me crazy. I hate having to take the nipple ring on and off to get it screwed on just right so that it doesn't leak. You shouldn't have to do all of that just to keep the milk from leaking. I think they have very poor craftmanship, and need to be discontinued until they are able to redo them. I will never purchase these bottles again, and if I knew then what I know now, I would have never purchased them in the beginning."
1,Not the greatest....,"I bought and asked for tons of ""Avent"" Bottles and they worked horribly for me and my son wouldnt eat from them and cried constantly. I even had spent $60 on the ""Isis breats pump"" which was worthless. These bottles would not release when my son was eating, so only when he starting crying because he was fed up, did air go through the nipple and let the formula come down so he could eat. I think, one of the best and honestly, more practical, things to do is buy one type of bottle of each one you think is good, then once the baby is born see what works best with them. It will save you a lot of trouble in the end, because Dont take anyone's word for certain bottles or ""cures"" for your baby - in time you'll know and understand your son's or daughter's needs."
1,A Leaky Trend!!!!!!!!,"I bought these bottles because I had always heard they were the best, but what I soon found out was that they are just trendy and not practical at all!!!! They leaked all over my baby girl and I had no idea how much formula she had actually gotten......I think most of it was on her clothes. I hate these bottles and I am going out to buy some Dr. Browns to see how they work!!!"
2,OK bottles,"Overall there were a few things about these bottles that were very convenient as the other reviewers have stated. The one problem I had which made our lives miserable is that they always leaked. I have heard of others having this problem and it is a real pain. We would get milk all over ourselves and our daughter and anywhere nearby (the counter, floor etc.). We would have to clean it up and change bottles while our child was screaming for her meal. Next time around I will probably go with a different brand."
1,don't waste your money on these bottles!!,"They are the worst bottles I have ever purchase !!! Everytime we feed him it leak all over him and made my baby cry so hard because it make so much gas.You will never know how much he drinks. because he keeps on spits back out.I have purchase all the bottles in the market so far the Playtex vent aire is the best^__^ no leak, no gas, no colic."
4,A little secret I found!,"Parents, if you are going to purchase this item you will love to know that the Nuby sippy cups (w/the soft silicone sippy) are compatible with the avent nipples and nipple holder. I wish I would of known this sooner! I would of bought the nuby sippy cups sooner and not spend so much money on the bottles. I give the bottles 4 stars b/c they are durable but they are bulky. The nuby sippy cups are slimmer and hold 8 oz. My baby can't tell the difference! It's the Avent nipple on a slimmer, less expensive, bottle-cup!"
5,These bottles don't leak if you do them right,"I also had problems with the bottles leaking out from under the rings. Just like the other reviewer, I screwed them on as tight as I could. I went to the avent website and looked at the FAQ's. They say that the problem is that you're not supposed to tighten them too hard. That makes the base of the nipple wrinkle and lets formula leak out. You're just supposed to tighten them lightly. After I read this, I tried it their way and have not had a single one leak on me since."
1,"Possibly unsafe plastic, leaks","These bottles leak like crazy... and they are/were (at the time of this review) made from potentially unsafe plastics (PVC, phtalates). I would stay away from this brand. We've been very happy with First Years Soothies instead."
1,"Terrible leakage, don't waste your money","These bottles were supposed to be the ""best"" so we went with them, and they were good for about a week. When you would put the tops back on and shake them to make sure that the formula was mixed - the formula went EVERYWHERE! You would have to screw the top on and off several times to get a good seal, and even then it still might leak all over and run down your baby's chin and chest. I also found that my son was getting way too much air from the nipple, you could hear it very loudly. These bottles are all in all NOT worth it, I hope that this was helpful to some of you :)"
4,"Questionable at first, but....","Now I love them. The only reason I didn't like them at first was that my newborn son was sucking alot of air through the corners of his mouth while using these bottles. I think that the nipples were just too big for him as a newborn. Now that he's 1 month old, we are not having any problems. He has less gas now too since switching back to Avent.I have not had one instance of leaking with these bottles either."
1,The worst bottles out there,"I had received a ton of these bottles at my baby shower and they are absolutely the worst there is. They leaked everywhere. I thought perhaps I was putting the nipples on wrong or not tight enough...but that did not work. So I decided to purchase new nipples, that didn't work either. I would never waste my money on these again. I threw away $100 worth of these things...The playtex nursers are better...besides the liners are disposable and there isn't any stuck milk or formula powder to clean up.Don't buy these. You will regret it."
2,Return this item,I registered for these bottles and sure wished I would've returned them when I had the chance. They leak!! And we are not talking about a drop here and there. It is a stream of formula coming out. If you can get them to not leak they would be ok.
2,No Good for Breastfeeding Moms,"I breastfed my son for 5 months and gave him occasional bottle with either formula or pumped breastmilk since he was born. He had problems with the Avent newborn nipple, the flow was too fast for him for the first month. The milk would drip out of his mouth. Eventually he got used to it, but he had problems with spit up so we switched to Dr.Brown bottles (less spit up). When my son was around 4 months old he refused Avent bottles and Dr.Brown bottles. We tried different size nipples, we tried warming the nipple, we tried heating the formula at different temperature. Nothing worked. For two weeks it was like that. Finally I tried Gerber NUK size 2 and I couldn't believe my eyes, he started sucking immediately. If you're switching between breastfeeding and bottlefedding save your money and buy the most inexpensive and the best bottle out there, Gerber bottles (especially NUK)."
1,IF YOU LIKE BUBBLES AND LEAKS....,I HAVE NEVER SEEN MORE BUBBLES EXCEPT IN A BUBBLE BATH! THESE BOTTLES ALSO LEAK A LOT. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT AFTER ALL THE HYPE!!! DR BROWN'S ARE WAY BETTER.
1,Don't Buy!!,"What a waist of money! I have a set of twins at home - how frustrating is it for the 6:30am feeding when your bottle leaks all over your children! Not did it happen once, but twice in the same day! The bottles don't just leak, they pour out! Plus, after 20 minutes of sucking, the kids usually fall asleep & have only taken half their bottles - only to get up a couple of hours later for more! I would never recommend these bottles to anyone!"
1,leaky,"Don't waste your time or your milk or formula money. These bottles leak if you don't screw them on ""just right."" I have been using bottles in my profession since 1995 and I have never encountered the problems I have had with the so called best bottle advent. I decided to spend the extra money and by the advent bottles when my baby was born in July. I have several of their bottles and they are all faulty. Imagine spilling your milk all over your baby, or all over the floor while your baby is still screaming with hunger. Save yourself the headache and by something else. If you like the nipples use them with another bottle. The ring attachment system on the Advent bottle does not work. I am going to have to spend even more money to replace all the bottles with a different system, don't let it happen to you."
1,Contains BPA,"I had started with these bottles. Then I called AVENT, and they told me these bottles contain BPA. I switched to the Tempo Liner bottles and they work just as well."
3,Leaky Bottles,"Don't buy these bottles, they will leak!! I am now trying to find another bottle that will work better."
1,Buy Dr. Brown's bottle instead,"The Avent bottle leaks, has nipple collapse because of the vacuum of air and my baby was swallowing alot of air. I have been using Dr. Brown's for 11 months, they are the BEST, no leaking, no vacuum, no gulping air, no more reflux! These bottles are the best for a baby with gastro/colic problems or without. They are the SAME price as Avent, so buy Dr. Brown's, your baby will thank you!"
1,The worst,"Don't believe the hype surrounding these bottles. Everyone told us that these were the best, etc.... Well, they're not. They leak everywhere (despite using the fix outlined on the package) and their low flow nipples only work if you have an hour to spare for each feed. We have had much better luck with the basic nipple/bottle set ups from Gerber or Playtex."
4,"Great bottles, no leaking problems!!","I was unsure if I was going to like these bottles after I read so many negative reviews about them, but I must say that I love them! (and so does my son) I am able to combine breastfeeding with bottle feeding and have had no problems with nipple confusion. Also, I have not had any problems with leaks like many of the other reviewers have complained of. The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because when I give my baby formula in these bottles, so much of the formula turns into foam due to the special air vent system this nipple has. (this does not happen when giving breast milk in the bottles) Overall I would say this is a great product, I'm very happy I invested my money in it, and I would reccomend it to anyone."
3,Leaky bottles,The Avent bottles were recommended to us because the nipple is more like the breast than other bottles. My wife and I have had terrible problems with these bottles leaking and sometimes the the milk comes out much faster than our baby can drink . These bottles are also pretty spendy which really wouldn't be a big deal if they did not leak all over our baby.
3,nipple too fast for newborn,I registered for these bottles because all of my friends recommended them. My 3 week old daughter has difficutly with these bottles because the formula just pours out the sides of her mouth. She used the Stage 1 nipple and they are too fast for her. We tried the Playtex Ventaire- she latched on well to those but they caused too much gas. She cried in pain. Today I'll be making a trip to purchase Dr. Brown's bottles to see how they work...
3,Our daughter prefers the Playtex,"At 2 months of age, my doctor said to start supplementing my breastmilk with formula at each feeding. She would not take the avent bottle. We switched to Playtex and have had no problems.The nipples are sooo long and even the ""slow flow"" alow for much more formula thru than the playtex.Now, the only use our Avent bottles get is to store the formula made for the day in the fridge. Maybe as she gets older, she will like the avent style nipple...."
3,Overpriced,"I didn't actually use these bottles, but a friend of mine did. For my baby I used Gerber bottles (which are about $1 per bottle) because the nipples most closely resembled the nipples he was given in the NICU. I can honestly say that my son had no more gas pains than my friend's daughter.. in fact, I'd say he had less. The Gerber bottles never leaked, and the nipples/rings fit perfectly on my Medela containers."
2,what IS the proper way to screw on the cap???,"We have a 1 week old, and are experiencing the same leaking problems described by other reviewers. For those of you that have figured it out, would someone PLEASE advise the rest of us what it is you are doing? Screw the cap on very tight? Rather loose? Not too loose nor too tight? Assemble everything while wet, out of the dishwasher??? PLEASE HELP! We've checked out the Avent website, and are still at a loss."
3,Good bottles but fast flow and leaks,"We have tried every bottle out there and like these the best for our newborn. There are a few drawbacks. The nipple flow is fast for a newborn. The bottles also leak which is annoying. Usually if you just unscrew and screw top back on, it stops leaking. The bottles are easy to clean."
4,Great bottle but I hate the leaking!,"I love the size of the bottle but every time the bottle leaks all over me when I shake it, I get so annoyed! If I have to be extra careful to have the nipple tight and the screw capped on perfectly when I am stumbling in the dark at 3 in the morning, is this bottle worth it?"
2,Disappointed- doesn't even compare to the Playtex Nurser!,"Too much air is allowed into the baby's stomach. I tried these bottles but my daughter seemed to get more air and then became fussy and gassy. I suggest the Playtex Nursers over the Avent. Every baby is different so it may just be my experience so you should try a few different ones. The reason I gave it two stars is b/c I like how you can interchange all of Avent tops with every type of bottom they make. All of the lids and nipples fit all of the cups, bottles, storage containers etc. That is nice. I am glad I decided to register for the Playtex over the Avent."
2,DESIGN FLAW THEY LEAK.,"At first we loved these bottles (not many parts, easy to read) then we noticed that they have a tendency to leak milk by the seam. We contacted Philips and they said you must wet the seal completely to prevent leaking we tried that and they still leaked about 1/3 of the time. So we went out and bought Dr Browns and are giving the Avent away. The Dr. Browns are made in the USA and have more parts but our baby seems to like them better, less fussy and less drool while eating."
2,Leaks,"Initially, I really liked these bottles....but recently, I have experienced a lot of leaking with them. I did read the information they provided. I am replacing the bottles every 3 months. I am careful not to change the temp. to quickly as the company says that may cause cracking in the ring. I am screwing the bottles on lose..tight....tighter....it doesn't seem to matter. It's very frustrating for me and my son. It's a tease to him when he thinks he's getting a bottle and it ends up all over both of us and then I need to go try and find one that won't leak ""this time"". Unfortunately, my son is very use to them...so it's hard to switch...If you can find a bottle that doesn't cause you this aggrevation whether the ring is tight or lose or whatever...then you really should purchase it"
2,Too many bubbles= Too much gas,"Our little girl was born a month early and I was only able to breastfeed for 2 weeks. I heard such great things about Avent so we registered for the entire system, breast pump, bottles, sterilizer, food warmer. Everything was great except the bottles. They leak and have a lot of bubbles. I finally switched to Dr. Browns no more screaming and a lot less gas. A bit expensice but well worth it."
3,Good bottles...,"I originally bought these bottles because I planned on breastfeeding and using these to hold pumped breast milk. I ended up choosing to bottle feed. These bottles are good but I did find that they had a leaking problem. I went on the web site and after reading the other reviews, I figured out how to correct that. I also had a problem with the formula leaking out of my sons mouth while he was feeding. He would loose 1-2 ounces of formula this way. I just figured out why... The baby has to latch on just as if he was latching onto a breast. The lips must be flanged out. This keeps the formula from dripping out of the mouth. Hope this is helpful to anyone else who had the same problem!"
1,Not worth the extra money!,"I had heard that Avent bottles were the best ones, so, of course, got plenty of them. At first we really liked using them, but then again, we had never had a baby before and didn't know the difference. We immediately got frustrated by the amount of formula that would leak all over us and our baby! We tried everything, loosening the top during heating, pulling the nipple out and putting back in, tightening the top, and NOTHING worked. Or, it would work for a while and then leak again. I'm sure that some of you might want to have to fight with them since they are good bottles, but not me! Why struggle with a bottle when there are some out there you don't have to! We tried the Evenflo bottles, and LOVE them. No leaking, and they are angled for better flow. I don't see them on line, but you can get them at the store. Happy Feeding!"
1,Piece of CRAP bottles!,"These bottles are THE MOST piece of SH*&! bottles on the market!!! They are expensive and they leak all over every time. I can't even believe that they can make a bottle that leaks and then rip us off in the process. This bottle has ruined my life! My kitchen is full of milk that has leaked out of these stupid bottles. I have to change my sons crib sheet, (yes the crib sheet which everyone knows is a freaking pain in the butt to change) all the time because the bottle leaks all over his bed. These bottles drive me up the wall and piss the HELl out of me everyday!!!"
1,Oh the leaks!,"My husband and I can't tell you how many times we have made formula and started shaking only to be covered with a mess! These are the worst, and I have tons of them.. My husband actually broke the faucet in my kitchen sink out of frustration from these bottles.."
1,Leaky Bottle,We've been using these for 3 months now and the leaks are becoming unbearable. How hard can it be to design a bottle that does not leak? Buyer beware!
2,Disappointed,"I had registered for these bottles thinking that they were the BEST. Little to my surprise they LEAK... I found this out the hard way after putting the bottle in my daughters mouth, then finding out it was leaking all over her. I find that I have to rinse the nipple out with water and screw it back on. Most of the time it won't leak from then on. But to make my daughter cry even more, isn't worth buying these bottles again. I now make sure the bottles don't leak before I stick it in her mouth, by slowly putting it on it's side about 5 times. I feel like I am teasing her with this bottle. Although this bottle does have it's +++ to it, like they are short, holds 9 ounces and they are alot easier to clean then the tall bottles. But I still won't buy them again...................."
3,Not for all babies,"I bought the Whole Avent system from 4oz bottles to 9oz, nipples of every size & sippy cups plus matching bottle warmer. I fell in love with the wide necks for easy cleaning and that everything was interchangable.Our son was bottle feed from birth and he had no problems using the Johnson's Healthflow bottles I recieved as a gift but when we use the Avent ones I bought it took him forever to finish!!! We even tried the 3 hole nipples for faster flow, but still it took him to long and he would get frustrated & won't finish his bottle. So we went and bought the whole Johnson's Healthflow system and he had no problems finishing his bottle. Also when my son was about 6 motnhs old and could hold his own bottle he had a hard time holding the Avent bottle because they are so Wide, were the healthflow which are skinner he had an easy time holing. I suggest only buying a few Avent to make sure baby likes them before getting the Whole set."
1,Toxic Product,"I ordered these bottles and soon after found they were made of polycarbonate which contains BPA- a chemical that mimics the human hormone estrogen and has been found to stimulate certain cancers. Early exposure to BPA can cause genetic damage, prostate cancer and ovarian dysfunction."
5,DUH,"I don't understand why these idiots keep on complaining about leaks. I have been using these bottles since my baby's birth. He's now 6 month old and I have yet to encounter a problem with them. Bottom line is, if you think it's a pain to use this bottle, then BREASTFEED! It will be better for your baby, plus you won't have problems with leaking bottles. :-)"
2,"Leak, leak, leak.....","If I had not been given a ton of Avent bottles, I would have chosen some other system. The leaking is terrible!!! You have to buy the disks separately, you should get them for free because they are absolutely essential. The only way to mix formula in the bottle or transport liquid is to use the disks in the ring, then switch to the nipple when you are ready to feed. The only reason I give it a two is because I do like that you can pump directly into the bottle with the ISIS breast pump. And, I like the sippy cups."
2,Need to check the cap if tighten,"I bought this at Babies 'R' Us. Love the bottle but not the leak. You need to correctly tighten the cap with the bottle or else there will be leak. Sometimes, I have to tighten it couple of times before getting it right. I wish Avent make it more easy for new parents as it is very annoying with a crying baby needing milk while I was spending all the time trying to get the cap on tighten the right way so there will be no leak."
2,DON'T BUY THESE,"At first I thought these bottles were great but then they started to leak all of the time. I then went out and purchased a whole new supply of them thinking they were used too much or put in the dishwasher to much.However, it has only been about 6 weeks and they are now leaking everywhere. If you do get these bottles make sure you always have extra clothes with you and extra diaper bags. There is nothing worse than going somewhere and getting a bottle out of the bag only to realize not only is your bag and everything in it soaked you also have no water to make your hungry baby a bottle."
2,Not worth the pain,"These bottles are just not worth the pain. I agree with other users, they just leak way too much. Then, the directions tell you not to tighten the collar too tight, yet if you have it too loose, the nipple is too fast. There are all these different instructions on how to properly install these. It's just not worth the headache, especially at a 2am feeding. Also, my baby still spits up and has gas when using these but I have yet to find a bottle that would eliminate spitup and gas."
1,not great for a newborn,"We got these bottles because they are supposed to be the closest thing to breast feeding, and they advertise a 'slow-flow' nipple. Needless to say, the milk just ran down our baby's chin every time. The slow-flow is not slow enough for a baby who is accustomed to breast feeding and having to work at gettimg milk out. They are way too expensive and didn't work well for us."
1,"Leak Leak and Leak some more, horrible!","These bottles leak at random and usually it is when my son has nice clean clothes on. He is almost 1 and I used these for past few months, I will not use with my next child."
3,More leaks!,"I used these bottles with my first child after weaning him from the breast. They leak unbelievably causing a mess! He still uses his bottle and will not switch to another brand so we are constantly checking and rechecking the seal. Needless to say, we switched to Playtex for our second child and have not had any problems with these botles."
2,not worth it,"I heard so many good things about these bottles, so I put them down on my registry. The first couple of times I feed my son with them I had no problems. Then they started leaking like crazy, I thought the bottle was cracked, but it happened with all of them. And he had such a problem with gas that these bottles did not help at all, they only added to it. so I tried buying other bottles (playtex ventair etc.) and nothing seemed to work (they just didnt leak which was good) so finally I bought those Dr. Brown bottles, and we just love them. No more leaks and no more air bubbles. I gave this 2 stars because they are easy to clean and good for freezing breast milk in. I now just use them to mix formula in."
1,Disappointed with these bottles!,"I was very dissapointed with these bottles. I heard so many good things about them and tried them out. I think I should of stayed with the Playtex bottles. These bottles leak so much, my daughter has woken up all drenched in milk because they leak. Never again will I be purchasing these again....."
1,Leaking and air problems,"I still do not understand why these bottles are so well rated. Due to advice from my SIL, I requested this for my baby shower and was incredibly disappointed in them.The bottles constantly leak, and I have tried every suggested trick. There is no way around it. And when I have a crying hungry baby in my arms, I do not want to have to take the time to do everything to ensure that the bottle doesn't leak.Then, there is the air bubble issue. The amount of air bubbles that enter the bottle when my baby is eating is tremendous. This has led to severe colic problems.These bottle have been packed away for good and I only use Dr. Brown's."
2,leaky but all right bottles,"I have had a big problem with these bottles leaking when you go to shake up the formula at 4 am with a crying little one who wants to take the extra time to make sure that these finicky bottles and nipples are perfectly straight, but on a lighter note my son had no trouble going from bottle to brest which was nice! Also he has never had a gas problem using these!"
2,Leaking bottles,"I was very disappointed with the Avent bottle/nipples because of how much they leak when my baby feeds. So much formula ends up dripping down the sides of her face and nearly runs into her ears! I tried switching among the different Avent nipples but this didn't make any difference. I'm going to go back to using the Gerber bottle/nipples, which hardly leaked."
2,noisy and leaky,i believed all the hype on these bottles and now i wish i hadnt wasted the money. they leak if you dont have the top on just right and when they vent the air it makes this annoying high pitched noise. im very disappointed with them!!!!
4,Almost perfect,"Since I knew I wouldn't be breastfeeding after returning to work, I began researching bottles before my daughter was born. Avent bottles received great reviews and now I know why. The transition from nursing to bottles was a breeze thanks to the patented design of the Avent nipples. My daughter never developed nipple confusion and never once rejected feeding from the bottle. The Avent bottles with the wider neck are easier to clean and the Avent sterilizing system makes them even easier to sterilize. I recommend this product to any mother who wants whats next to best when it comes to feeding their newborn. Of course, nursing is the number one method. The only reason why I didn't rate this product a 5 star product is because the bottles are unusually wide."
2,"LEAKS, LEAKS, LEAKS","I bought these bottles because I had heard from others that they were the best. For the first few months we owned them, they worked great! Then the leaks started... at 3am when you are half awake, trying to feed your little one- it is really irritating to have formula, milk, juice-- running all over your baby and yourself. After screwing and re-screwing the top on over and over... it just isn't worth it. Not to mention, they are expensive.I am pregnant again and will be using another bottling system."
2,Can't stand the leaking!,"Baby seemed to do well with these bottles (less gassiness), and the wide bottles were comfortable to hold while feeding her, but I couldn't stand the leaking anymore! The 4 oz. bottles weren't too bad, but the larger ones were terrible (I think they are 7 oz?). I sold them all on Ebay and cut my losses."
2,Too much leakage...,"My baby and three other babys in our ""playgroup"" experienced leaking around the nipple - like the babies just can't get their mouths closed around the nipple. I gave up on Avent bottles all together."
2,not good enough,Bottles LEAK!!! did not solve gas problem. We switched to Dr Browns bottles ant we are much more happy. Try before you buy.
2,Doesn't deliver as promised,Don't bother buying these if you want your baby to take in less air. Go with the Dr. Brown's. My kids actually ingested more air b/c of the nipple shape - they just couldn't get their mouths around the large base.Reasons I give 2 stars:-well-made-easy to clean
2,Not the best bottles,I am a first time mother and have bought just about every bottle out there for our very finicky daughter. I had heard a lot of great things about the Avent system and decided to invest in it. They definitly did not help with my daughters colic and she would get so frustrated when they leaked all over her. She is on formula and so much of it turns to foam when she drinks that it is hard to tell how much she has acutally had. After trying so many different bottles she is very happy with the Playtex Ventaire system and so are we.
1,Great bottles but crappy seller.,"Sent me 3 bottles one of which didn't have a lid in the box. Crappy quality control. Just buy them at the store for more money, at least you'll get all the parts with it. 5 stars for avent, -5 stars for seller."
3,leak,"my baby took this nipple better than any other, but these bottles do leak. I have to check and retighten the lids before I use them or there is a big mess. I know several others who have used these bottles and all have said they have this problem. I read one reveiw that the lady said she figured out how to stop this, so can you tell the rest of us how please!"
2,Great bottles - if they didn't leak!,"I started using the Avent bottles with my second child. They are great for reducing/eliminating gas, and are very easy to clean. However, they frequently leak, and not just a little, but a lot at times, particularly when removing the bottle from my daughter's mouth & turning it upright when taking short breaks in between feeding. She typically ends up very wet, and I've also wound up with formula on my carpet and/or furniture which is a real hassle. Regardless of how much care is taken when assembling the bottles, the leaking still occurs. Bottom line is that there shouldn't be a ""trick"" to preventing the bottle from leaking - it just shouldn't leak! I never had these types of problems with other brands I used with my first child, although I did struggle to find a bottle that eliminated gas. I'm now looking to switch to another brand."
1,not great for nursing infants,"The nipple is so long that my infant was gagging everytime i tried to feed her. It isn't great for infants that are nursing...My daughter had a fit when i tried to feed her. Not only was she gagging, but she just didn't like the nipple. I used the playtex nurser bottle and she loved it. I have been using those bottles and nipples ever since, and she is doing great when i need to switch from breast to bottle."
2,Baby Enthusiast,"I wish Avent would give me back all the money I spent on these bottles. The leaking is ridiculous, 5 a.m. is no time to be changing baby p.j's drenched in formula! Save yourself the misery and buy any other bottle but these."
2,Not compatible with breastfeeding for us,We bought a ton of these bottles before our baby was born. We had heard that they are the best choice for babies who are breastfeeding and don't use bottles on a regular basis. Maybe they work for some but they didn't work for us at all. So if you are buying make sure you only buy one to try before you invest and a whole set. The other problem I had is that the bottles did leak no matter how I tried to get the lid on. After trying many types of bottles our baby liked the playtex nurser system with the medium flow orthodonic nipples. Hope this helps and Good Luck!
1,Does not vent air,"My baby tried these bottles and you could hear the air he was swallowing. He woke up that night much earlier than usual and had horrible gas. Dr. Brown's bottles are so much better and not much more $. Also, the extra nipples you buy with Dr. Brown's bottles come with 3, and the Avent come with 2 (doesn't make much sense if you buy a 3 pack Avent bottles)."
2,Drip Drip Drip,"I purchased these bottle after trying the Playtex Ventaire bottles, which I did not like. While these bottles did reduce my baby's gassiness and feeding time, they constantly leak.You wouldn't think it would take a brain surgeon to screw the nipple/cap onto the bottle and not have it leak. But the majority of the time, the formula leaks from the bottle. In the beginning my baby was wearing as much of the formula as he was eating. I now find myself screwing, re-screwing and re-screwing the cap and holding it upside down over the sink as a test to see if the bottle leaks. And then, just when you think it's safe,..lookout, the dreaded drip is back. The last thing you want to do when you have a hungry and screaming baby is waste time testing the bottle to see if it's leaking. And, it's not just me who has a problem with the bottles,--I know two other moms who have encountered the same problem. Save yourself the aggrevation and buy another bottle system.This one has a MAJOR design flaw."
5,Love Em,"I started using these bottles when my son was about 2 weeks old. I was having trouble with him taking the breast after having a bottle, as soon as I changed to these, I had no more problems. I like them because they are short and fat, now that he's taking 6 oz.Also before I swiched him he was having trouble with him spitting up all the time. He was on 4 different formulas and nothing seemed to help. I even took him to a allergist and he had no allergies to any of the milk. I love everything about these bottles. I have had no troulbes at all with Gas, spitting up or him taking the breast since I changes. They cost a little more then some bottles but there well worth the money.."
2,They leak!,"I bought these bottles because it was the ""THING TO DO"", but I am not satisfied at all. I thought I was crazy, until I started asking around. The Avent bottles definitely have a tendency to leak. Sometimes they don't, but most of the time they do! I can't seem to figure it out. The leaking is incredibly frustrating. (...)"
3,Not for the liesure nurser,"These are best if your baby like sto chug milk. I'm breatfeeding my 2 month old and used avent bottles when i went back to work. She would finish the bottle off in 5 mniutes and had horrible gas. The newborn/slow nipples were much too fast. She is more of a leisure nurser, and was getting horrible gas/spit-ups from gulping the milk so fast. I did like how all the bootle parts (seals/nipples) are interchangable, that's why i gave it 3 stars.I will still use them for milk storage, (...)"
1,Don't waste your time.,Get Dr. Brown's bottles. They are worth every cent. They're the best out there!
2,Not worth the money!,"I bought these bottles thinking they were the best for gas & spit up. I think they work well in these departments however, they LEAK all the time!!! It is so frustrating to have a hungry screaming baby and you have to stop and try screwing the lid on differently and most of the time use another bottle all together!! For the cost, I would expect them to at the least not leak all over your baby when you tip it upside down."
2,"Leaky, messy.","i bought the whole line of avent products becaue i've heard a lot of good things about them. the only product that i absolutely love is their pump. but not so for the feeding system. i got no problem with the bottles, but the nipple itself leaks/drips faster than my baby can handle. if he stops to take a breath from drinking, he'll get frustrated because the milk is still flowing. however, the nipple did not cause nippple confusion in my case, for the week we put up with the leakage, the baby was able to go back and forth from breast to bottle with no problem.switched to soothie bottle and he's a happy baby."
4,Great Bottles,"If you are using Similac Formula, then you have a problem. Similac makes a lot of bubbles. But if you use Enfamil like we do, then you don't have a problem because Enfamil powder is finer whereas Similac is grainy/crumbly. The only leak problem I had was when I forgot to re-screw it on tighter. Other than that, it's been a great bottle."
4,Happy in Texas,"I began using the 9 oz AVENT bottles about three weeks after my son was born. After breastfeeding for three weeks to a baby that always seemed hungry, I bought a Medela breast pump and switched him to the AVENT bottles and we both have been happy campers ever since. Occasionally I do have a problem with leaks, but that mostly seems to be when I do not insert the nipple under water. On average, I keep 9-10 bottles of breastmilk in the refrigerator ready to go and immediately wash or rinse the bottle/nipples after each feeding and have not had any problems with cloudy bottles or nipples. I did not purchase any of the extra supplies such as warmers, storage containers from Avent. To warm a bottle, I use warm water which will warm the milk in about 10 minutes. I would definitely recommend these bottles to any new mother."
4,Fast eater Bottle,"I got the Avent bottles from my baby shower. If you wash them with correct soap and don't tighten them to tight just right they won't leak. I like them because my daughter is a fast eater and bottles accomdate her she doesn't have problems like with other bottles. Also, bottles easy to assemble after washing. The only problem I have with them is that they are to fat, hard to fit into diaper bag. Nevertheless, very good bottles but every baby is different. My little girl gulps down her milk with very little gas and loves the avent bottles."
2,Frustrated!,"These bottles came highly recommended because my son has reflux. I love the way the nipple is so similiar to the breast and the shape of the bottle is easy to handle. It has helped with my son's reflux however, I am very FRUSTRATED with them leaking. I have gone to the Avent web site and have followed all of their helpful tips on how to stop the bottles from leaking but they continue to do so. The most frustrating is when it happens at 3:00 am or when we are out in public and the bottle leaks all over both us. The web site gives a step by step process on how to stop them from leaking, they continue to leak and I just feel that feeding your child should not be this difficult. I have written Avent and am waiting to hear back from them. Right now I am looking into other bottles. If it weren't for the leaking I would have given them a 5 star rating."
2,Buy just one to see if it works for your baby,"This Avent bottle was totally wrong for my newborn. He dribbled formula all over himself and could never properly drink without sucking in a lot of air. As soon as I switched him to the plain old fashioned rubber nipple, those problems went away. I'm sure Avent works fine for other babies, so I can't say in general these are bad bottles--they just weren't right for our baby. Definitely buy just one Avent brand and test it out to see if it works for you."
2,Disappointed Mom,"I purchased these bottles based on the advertisement that they are supposed to reduce air making them ideal for babies with colic or severe gas. My daughter has colic and did horrible with the Avent bottles. In fact these bottles created such a vacuum that my daughter wasn't able to eat without difficulty and caused escessive gas. They did leak occasionally, but that wasn't such a concern for me. I've contacted Avent and demanded a refund. I would not recommend these bottles, especially if your baby has colic. I found the Dr. Brown's bottles work better or Playtex Ventaire if your baby has colic or is gassy."
2,not all it's cracked up to be,I bought these bottles twice and both times they leaked. They didn't leak all the time but fairly often. The flow was fine but the leaking was really annoying. would n ot recommend.
3,bearyunhappyuser26,"hi,for all you first time mom's out there trying 2 find a perfect bottle 4 your baby,don't get this!!! they leak and cause a very bad mess.i used the dr.brown's bottle's 4 a month for both of my kids cause they had colic and then i switched to playtex nurser's,and they have been no problem to me at all. my family and i are on a tight budget and these bottles r not pricey and they work very well."
2,Not Just a Leak - A POUR!,"I swore I would never take the time to write a review, however, these bottles have major leakage problems. And not just a tiny leak...every bottle pours out - randomly no less! Every time I mix bottles, I make sure there are no leaks, however, midway through a feeding the formula will pour out of the side of the cap. It's drenched my baby, me, and our furniture. I wish I had read the reviews as I notice this is a problem with the Avent bottles. I don't foresee myself purchasing a new brand of bottles as they can be a bit expensive. You live, you learn!"
4,Avent bottle leakage,"Suyen, Thank you for your advice on turning the Avent bottle cap counter clockwise until it clicks and then right to tighten as usual. The bottles do not leak and work great. Love them."
2,Great bottles - only for the first 6 months,"I am extremely tired of having to clean up messes after feeding our twin sons with the Avent bottles. Especially if we are out for a big event and the boys are dressed nicely. The bottles worked great for the first six months and then.....THEY ALL LEAKED. It was not a small leak rather, a pouring leak that soaked their shirts. I hate these bottles and plan to switch!!!"
2,Leaky Bottles,"I thought I would love these bottles after reading all the reviews. They were great at first, then all of the sudden they starting leaking all over my son and myself during feedings!!! I then started using the playtex ventaire bottles and they have been great!! Don't invest a lot in these bottles. They are great for storage though and the nipples seem compatible with my son. Too bad they leak everywhere!"
2,TOO MUCH AIR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have a 6 week old with colic and reflux, During a doctors visit i was feeding my son and my doctor came in, He made a comment on how much air my son was sucking down from the avent bottles. You could acually see the air bubbles and hear them going down. I was advised to switch to the doc brown bottles and this made a huge diffrence! I dont advise these bottles at all. Not to mention that one week after use 2 has already started to leak."
3,"Ok bottles, flow too fast for breastfeeding newborn","I did not have any problems with leakage and the bottles and nipples are very sturdy and easy to clean. However, the slow flow nipples were too fast for my daughter. She does a lot better with the Playtex slow flow nursers. They are not as attractive as the Avent but she gets a lot less air with them. My advice; try several different bottles before buying a lot, some babies will like different bottles."
3,Well written and fast paced,This is an early book from Jack Higgins. The story revolves around a British secretagent who infiltrates a prison to discover who is behind some high profile jailbreaks.The story is somewhat hard to believe but Higgins does a great job of keeping you interested.Good book for a plane ride.
4,outstanding story but not his best!,Wow what a book! i didnt care for the ending though! graetr characters though!
2,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the simple solsution ORIGINAL training pads. What I got was NOT what I ordered.I did get Simple Solution Puppy Pads but they are not nearlyas good as what I ordered.These pads leak through and onto the floor. This was never the case with the ORIGINALS.The long and short of it is simply this: What you see in the blurb is NOT what you get.Should you get the Orignal Training Pads that you think you are ordering, I can recommendthem highy. the Purply Packaged one I cannot recommend aat all."
2,Quality Assurance Poor,"I received it in a very timely fashion, however the book appeared to have been stored un-protected from dust and dampness. The entire book was so dirty,I had to be careful when handling it. There were very visible stains on the top and back cover,spine and front edge of the pages. The book reeked heavily of dirt and dampness.I choose not to return the book. So, I got a warm soapy cleaning rag to literally ""wash"" all sides of the book. I then let the book air-dry completely. I also, put baking soda in-between two towels and wrapped the book. I let the book sit for one week. This application successfully removed the ""dirty/damp"" smell.I have made numerous purchases from Amazon and was very pleased with all of them, except this one!! This experience has not deterred me from buying from Amazon, but I am now more skeptical about accepting the condition codes when buying from private vendors."
5,Wonderful,"This is a great video that all young children will love. Bonnie Raitt does an especially good job of narrating ""Choo Choo""."
4,Get the 2 cup,"This product is great, however, it seems unstable at the one cup line that is very close to the bottom. I am going to purchase the two cup and use them both! If I had it to do over - I would probably have just gotten the two cup"
1,We don't like it.,It has not worked like it did for Alton Brown. It shifts (doesn't stay where you put it) and drops on the smaller measurements (aka. the manufacturing variances are too wide between the inner and outer sections). I really wish I could return it. We are not pleased.
4,Good for the gooey stuff!,This is good for all soft and or gooey ingredients. I find it easier and quicker to use measuring cups for liquid measurements. The measurements for these (liquids) are about 1/4 in below the lip of the barrel. It makes it more difficult to hit the point exactly and you find yourself pouring out and then possibly having to put more in. Too much of a hassle for me. It works wonderfully for all the other ingredients you need it for.
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this item used it once and it fell apart the black cap fell off and the clear tube cracked. So not worth the price.
2,Awkward to fill. Pain in the sink to clean.,It's to wobbly and awkward to use with dry ingredients. IMHO not useful for daily cooking. How many times do you measure mayo or honey in a year? I'm sure it's great when someone else is filling it for you. It makes for good TV when you pop it into the bowl (looking at you Alton).This really doesn't belong in my kitchen. Give it a pass.
2,Not worth it for liquids,"If I were to rate this based on liquids only, I would give it zero stars. For dry measuring, like shortening, it is fine, maybe 4 stars. One star off because the plunger is not tight enough to stay in place when you put your ingredient in. You constantly have to monitor and adjust it. The liquid I tried, measured fine, but when I went to pick it up, the plunger went slightly askew and the liquid all came out the bottom!"
5,Easy to clean and use,"In Europe we don't have measures with the US-system, so I ordered this for American recipes.I love it! It is easy to use and most importantly, easy to clean! You do have to get used to which side is used for liquid and dry measures, but it is written on the cup!"
5,These are really handy,"Definately one of those items that, once you use it a few times, you wonder how you got along without it. I've had mine for over a year and bought several as gifts - everyone loves it!"
4,Great Little Kitchen Tool,"Works great for Peanut Butter, Shortening, and the like. Easy to clean. Mine is still new, so don't know about durability. So far, I love it."
1,You only get 12 ounces of bacon,"I ordered these directly from the Omaha Steaks website and was really looking forward to getting 100 slices of precooked bacon. The price seemed good, after all, I would have to buy about 6 pounds of bacon from the supermarket to get 100 slices. But beware...you do get 100 slices, but each piece is as thin as a piece of paper. The box that they come in clearly states 0.75 pounds (12 ounces). That's all you get. They charge $30 and you don't even get a pound of bacon. Now granted, it is cooked so I'm sure some of the weight is cooked out, but you don't even get 1 pound. Once heated the slices don't even hold together. I love Omaha Steaks products, but I wouldn't pay more then ten dollars for this product."
1,Darling Jenny. Wyoming. By. Janet Dailey,When Jenny left Minn to escape the hurt she felt when her boss tried to take advantage of her she never expected to fall in love with the man she thought was her sisters boyfriend.
5,A truly enjoyable book,I had the good fortune to see the movie as a child and then recieve the book as a gift for Christmas some 25 or so years ago. I think the book/movie gives some good lessons as well as wonderful entertainment. I would like people to urge Disney to re-release it. I had heard that they wouldn't due to some percieved racial tones. How sad!!! I believe every child should have the opportunity to see and read this classic
2,This book Depressed Me,"I read alot of romance novels and usually find some good in all, but this book really depressed me and made me want to ""slap"" the 2 main characters. Plus as one reviewer stated, there was alot of violence to the women.Sierna fought Regan at every turn, even though she was suppose to be in love with him. He in turn slept with anything that moved and kept a mistress, which he slept with on his wedding night. Plus, he flaunted it in front of his wife.I disliked Sierna as she was so cold and dramatic. Even after Regan sailed for months to find her, she still didnt think he loved her.The ending was frustrating as you had no idea if anything really worked out between them.I have started the second book and it opens with Regan is someone elases bed and Sierna at home, still pushing him away.Fern Michaels is a very talented writer and I hate to give a bad review, but this book really was depressing.I will see what the second in the series holds."
1,Beware! Worst Book Ever,"I have never written a review for any book before whether it was good or bad. But this book has motivated me to urge perspective readers to beware. It went from bad to horrible and yet I hoped somewhere there would be a turning point for the better. I never found it. I loathe Reagan. He and his promiscuous self slept with anything that had two legs. He is so superficial. Anything with a face and some breasts gets him riled up even his vile mistress Gretchen. How can you justify the leading man sleeping with someone else on his wedding night? He's a pathetic character. Yet he has the audacity to throw in Sirena's face the fact that she has lunches over the Spaniards house. Maybe it was just me, but I definitely missed where Sirena fell in love with him. What is there to love? On top of all that, the abuse of women was just horrible to watch. Beware. I should have looked at the earlier comments before i read this book. It was a waste of time."
2,Too brutal & disrespectful for true romance,"In this book the heroine leads a dual identity, a dutiful yet mysterious bride from Spain and a sea pirate known as the ""Sea Siren."" While I liked the character of the heroine & what a skillful female pirate she was, outwitting all the other males on Java island, I did not like the hero one bit. Now I like an Alpha male but I do not like a hero who, after he is married, keeps his malicious mistress, goes to brothels.... It just did not fare ware with me. Also, the passion between the two main characters was a weak flame at best, he loved the Sea Siren fare more than his shy bride."
1,Not Realy....,I have been wearing this for a week now and absolutely neither any positive compliments nor any sign of attraction! I get complements on other perfumes I wear all the time and am not an unattractive woman either. Do not recommend.
5,Pheromone perfume,My wife has used Pheromone perfume and cologne for years. It's fragrance is more spicy than floral and the fragrance holds up well. She says anything more than a tiny drop will be overpowering. It does smell sexy!
4,Looks and feels great!,"Wow! Since when can one get 'safety' glasses that are as fashionable as this? At $12.99, Amazon is selling this at a good price and I'm happy with the product. It hugs my face, looks sporty, is light weight and feels sturdy. I would not hesitate to recommend this product or to buy it again."
3,Buen producto. Buen precio,Es un Buen producto.Necesito este mismo producto en otros colores.El precio podría ser mas bajo.OK OK..Atte.
2,blocks peripheral vision,these are stylish glass. If you do not need peripheral vision. glass lenses are too small. you can see the frames in your field of vision. Only pro is the carrying case.
3,"not stellar, but good","These are comfortable and they definitely do their job. That being said, using these on a regular basis causes the rubber to start to peel off and deteriorate. Also, if you're using them for any application where they're going to be subjected to repeated hits (debris from weed-eating, for example), they are going to get scratched up pretty quick. There's not much point in spending 15 bucks if you're using them like that; you'd be better off getting a box of cheap safety glasses. Otherwise, they look more like sunglasses than safety glasses and are a decent buy."
3,National Geographic Television's first scripted film,"I only saw the Blu-ray disk and cannot compare to the standard DVD or TV. Naturally, we get great visuals and sound. However, visuals and sound does not make this story or acting.Henry Ian Cusick as Charles Darwin, and Frances O'Connor as Emma Darwin.This is a skillfully integrated drama about family and the personal life of Charles and that is inner dispersed with fragments of his work.This presentation is very slow paced with low-key background music. I do not know if this is for drama's sake or do you time to reflect. It starts out with Alfred Wallace, rival, trumping Charles on his theory of natural selection. The rest of the presentation is a series of flashbacks and unresolved scenes. Yet after a while, you forget that this is a stilted bunch of scenes and see a direction.""Honest and consciences doubts could never be a sin"", Emma Darwin.http://darwin-online.org.uk/"
2,Disorganized and Incomplete,"I passed the SSCP exam using this book and an online program, but I am sure glad I had the latter. The material in this guide was presented in a haphazard manner, and had I relied solely on the prep questions in the book and on the accompanying CD I would have been woefully unprepared. This was a good reference book, but hardly the ""one-stop source"" for the SSCP exam that was described on the back cover."
1,A one star book that cannot stand alone,"After using this book for review and having failed the exam using this book, I can confidently say that this book alone falls dismally short of it purported goal. I have turned to the Shon Harris All in one and the official ISC2 books for reivew of my CISSP exam (sscp is a forgone conclusion) as well as other sources.My reccomendation is that you don't even bother purchasing this books as it is a total waste of your hard earned money especially in light of a fine book (all in one) that is readily available.Caveat Emptor"
2,Album of covers,"This is not a *new* Vangelis album. It is old Vangelis tracks, produced and recorded by ""A Close Call"""
3,A must Have if you like the site,"This book is a must have if you like the website, it's got a few new stories and it reveals a bit more personal info...On the down side the book isn't as funny as the website was at it's beginning and the book generally follows the downward spiral of quality that has been affecting the website. What can I say? He's not as depressingly funny as he was when he wasn't getting any."
1,Worst book that i have come across,This is by far most useless book among the books about Network. It does not explain the concepts well. It doesn't serve as a reference well.
5,Headset is excellent - but showed up broken.,We run a home business and have purchased several of these headsets over the years - they are excellent for sound quality and comfort. The only downfall in this purchase is that it showed up broken - this is the first time we've experienced this. We are still trying to return the product for a replacement.
5,Great Lure -- for Bass and Pickerel / Pike,"This is one of my go-to lures for larger bass and pickerel / pike. Both will snap at it, either out of hunger or irritation. I've tried lots of lures with big names or flashy appearance but not results that were expected. This one delivers."
5,"Excellent book, good pics and Jim Hrisoulas tells you how to do things PROPERLY, not half @$$ed","Excellent book, Jim Hrisoulas tells you how to do things PROPERLY, not half @$$ed. He inspired me to start my own blacksmith shop, along with a few other books, for the prices you can get this book, it has incredible artwork along with a contact list for all of the artists, emails, phone numbers, etc. They welcome questions as this is a fairly rare craft nowadays."
4,needs colour photos,"Better editing is needed, unfortunately the photos are in B&W and below the average in quality, colour images are a must in this kind of work, since this is a one of a kind connection with the author. But, considering this is what is available at the moment, it is undoubtedly a master book for would be bladesmiths, the teachings contained in it are priceless."
3,Interesting 30's Era Soviet Film,"An interesting propaganda piece from the 1930s. A German unionist of uncertain political conviction is sent by his union to Soviet Russia, where he learns commitment to the communist cause. A predictable plot in many spots but nonetheless an interesting insight into Stalin era views of the world."
1,Canine Cooler doesn't last. Poor seam manufacturing.,It works and our dog loved it but it kept failing on the seams. Customer service kept replacing it until two years were up and then they said the poor quality was our problem since they supplied new ones to cover the two year warranty. We patched the seam and then the other seam failed a few months later on the other side of our final replacement. We replaced it with a K&H COOL BED II. With such a poorly made product I don't know how the Canine cooler company will survive?
2,Great while it last - but doesn't last long!,"In the past year I have purchased two of these cooler bed for my Akita. She loves the coolness of the bed, but the darned beds only last a few months before springing a leak! (let me add, my dog is not a digger or a chewer, so this happened under ""normal"" usage)After the first bed sprung a leak and was unfixable, I swore I wouldn't waste any more money. But I gave in after a couple of months and bought a second one, thinking I'd fill it with less water, be extra careful, etc. Less than half a year later, that one sprung a leak, as well. I have heard similar stories from other frustrated buyers. Yes, my dog liked it while it lasted, but unless you are OK with buying 3 or 4 at a time so you have a replacement all ready to go when it leaks, it's just a source of aggravation. Oh yeah, and if your carpet ends up ruined in the process, as mine was, that just adds to the insult!"
4,True Henry,I have seen Henry 2-3 times. Enjoyed his movie. I wish he would have been able to sing the entire songs during the movie.
5,Indie comedy for the Curb crowd,"The story of a singer/comedian who comes to Los Angeles to seek his fortune, and his account during his brief stay there. Henry Phillips sings folk songs that are not really folksy with lyrics that are impossible to sing along to. People who prefer Curb Your Enthusiasm over Seinfeld may appreciate the humor in this indie film. It's not a laugh a minute, because there's actually some kind of story involved here. But I found myself actually falling back in my swivel chair and laughing hard during some scenes. The humor is based on character and awkward situations. The way Henry Phillips gets mischaracterized as an anti-semitic folk singer reminds me of the best parts of Curb Your Enthusiasm. There are also some ususual characters that remind me of the offbeat Life and Times of Tim. Henry is a sort of everyman placed into weird and uncomfortable situations. This is not sitcomy Steve Carroll humor - it's subtle, intelligent, ironic and politically incorrect."
4,Slamdance Winner Worth Watching,"If you just quickly scan the description you might miss that is SLAMdance not SUNdance winner. Slamdance was created for all the great films that can't make it into Sundance. Unless you live in LA, you probably won't recognize anyone in this smart little film so it seems more like a documentary. A lot of the humor hits on inside acting/performing jokes but you will still enjoy the music and characters on their own. Everybody knows somebody like these characters."
5,Hollywood Hipster / Time Flys When Your Having Fun,"Movie morphine! Funny, refreshing, unique feel good screwball blackish musical comedy. This is an underrated little known indy gem of 2009. Great interior shots, inner workings and maxims of vapid Hollywood. Thumbs up from a Vegas hipster movie junkie. Definitely worth watching and hope it holds up second time around.This movie stands out in a league of its own so its tough to compare but if you like this check out Joe Dirt, Shakes the Clown, I Heart Huckabees, Louis C.K."
2,POEME,POEME By Lancome For Women EAU DE PARFUM SPRAY 3.4 OZ. MUST BE WATER AND FOOD COLORING. NO SCENT. IF I HAD KNOWN THIS I WOULDN'T HAVE OPENED THE BOX. ONCE YOU OPEN THE BOX YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN THE PRODUCT. HOW WAS I SUPPOSE TO KNOW IT WASN'T THE REAL THING WITHOUT OPENING THE BOX?
5,Always Complimented,"The perfume arrived in a timely fashion and was undamaged. I always receive compliments when I wear this perfume. I wear it so often that I don't even notice it myself anymore, but the compliments make me feel confident that those around me find it very pleasant."
2,Not recommended if you need the plastic fans.,"I ended up getting two of these to get one working fan because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of a return. Very poor packaging with nothing to protect the plastic fan blades from being damaged by the heavy motor during the drop-kick postal delivery. First one arrived with both fan blades broken, second with the large blade broken, but I only needed the small one. Motor is a little louder than the one it replaced, and seems to draw more current - when turning off switch, it kicks the breaker on the GFI outlet on the same circuit if both light switches for the bathroom are also on. I would have rated this 4 stars if the fan blades arrived undamaged - a little bubble packing would be worth another dollar or two in cost."
2,Bad Packaging,"This item comes poorly packaged so that the motor ends up breaking the fans. They are just in the box, no padding. I would recommend buying items like this from someone else."
4,Nice replacement,"The large fan with the motor that came with it, is a real good replacement for my old bathroom exhaust fan. For my bathroom since my house was built in the early 70's,I had to do a few modifications. Once the modifications were made the fan and motor works perfect. Now beware!!! If you are using the smaller fan it's pretty fragile. I installed it on the motor shaft to see how it would work with my set up. While trying to take the smaller blade off the shaft, I accidently broke a blade. Lucky I didn't need the smaller fan. Otherwise this motor is pretty silent compared to my original one"
5,Short and Sweet,This rare interview and mini documentary provides a rare look into a extraordinary and ordinary life. I commend the determination in getting this footage. I just wish there was more...
2,"Short, nothing interesting","short, nothing new nor interesting. It seemed that the first part of the movie was some boring intro about how the author tried to connect with Svetlana. The short pieces of interview itself were abrupt and interrupted by the author. After watching this short piece, i didnt see/ hear anything new"
5,perfect fireside reading,"Fabulous collection, highly recommended for dark evenings beside a real fire. only wish it came leatherbound with a cloud of dust."
4,The Collected Ghost Stories of E. F. Benson,Good stories but not my kind of endings. I like somethinga bit more concrete. My impression is he doesn't knowhow to. My fav is still HPL's Charles D Ward.(I have used two of Benson's stories at Cubscouts. Getsverrrrry quiet in the darkened art room. oOOOooOOO.)Good read. I recommend.
4,A romantic vampire tale set in 19th century England,"Darkness describes the relationship between the alluring vampire Contessa di Rospo and the human Dr. Andrew Quimby. The story is much more than a romance. The carefully developed characters grapple with deep issues: the purpose of life, the meaning of true love, issues of social inequality. Of the multiple villians, Carlo is the most memorable. While the main plot is based on a typical ""whodunit"" formula, the subplots and characterization keep the reader engaged in the story."
5,Great travel guide - Now I want the ride there!!!,"This is one of the greatest science books for the lay reader I have ever owned. Dr. Hartmann lays out in perfect detail what the history and topography of Mars appears to be and does it in an entertaining fashion that is not condescending to an intelligent non-specialist. The book is definitely worth the cost and will inform and entertain for many good hours. Buy it! Now, I just wish I could find a way to go to Mars in person!"
4,Complex and complete,"Everything I had hoped for.... It has maps, in summary, and lots of descriptions understandable to the ordinary lame. Slightly date."
4,A great guide to the Red Planet,"This was a textbook for a class on Mars. It is filled with interesting facts about the red planet and is a great resource to have in conjunction with the latest updates of NASA's rover, Curiosity."
3,Nice pictures,"In this book, we see Mars treated almost as if it was a tourist region. The author has divided Mars into areas of interest. He then discussed separately each area. Just like Earth, Mars has many different regions and scenery.Although I am keen on space, somehow this book did little for me. After awhile I found it too much and lost interest in the details of each region. What I would have preferred on Mars is fewer notes and more pictures.The other point is the book is full of interesting pictures unfortunately to appreciate them you need a large size book then this one.Having said that if your interested in Mars geography though you will find this author knows his information, it is current and he explains his points well."
4,giibson,very impressed with this exhaust.once broken in sounds great.i am a mechanic took me one hour to install and take old system down.great finish on product.took some polish to really shine it up.system looks and sounds great.
4,Bits not centered,"Pros:- inexpensive- work with small driver drills with hex chucksCons:- bits are slightly off centerI bought these to use with Dewalt 12V Max driver/impact wrench combo set. Since both the driver and the impact wrench in the set have hex chucks, I needed a set of drill bits with hex shanks. These bits were half the price of comparable sets.They aren't high quality bits, but they will work fine for most drilling. The biggest problems is that they aren't centered correctly. Put one in the drill, turn it on, and you will see considerable ""wobble"" at the tip of the bit. As long as you aren't doing precision drilling they should work fine."
1,shank came off the first time I used the drill bits,poor quality and Amazon's free return policy expired 6 days ago so I am stuck. Used Black and Decker bits thousands of times and never had any problems. My advice is to test all bits right away to test quality ds you can return all bad bits.
1,Poor Condition,"I was so disappointed upon receipt of this atomic clock. While it was exactly what I wanted for a gift, the entire plastic case was terribly marred and scratched and unsuitable for giving. This was the first item I have ever had to return. Usually the packing of items I receive takes extreme work to open -- this one was not the case. It was totally exposed and subsequently all scratched up."
2,LOOKS NICER THAN IT WORKS,I ENDED UP THROWING THE CLOCK AWAY BECAUSE IT KEPT STOPPING AND I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THE BATTERY OUT AND PUT IT BACK IN AND WAIT FOR IT TO RESET ITSELF. THIS HAPPENED MORE AND MORE FREQUENTLY UNTIL I'D FINALLY HAD ENOUGH AND TOSS IT. I DON'T MIND CHANGING A BATTERY WHEN IT RUNS DOWN BUT NOT DAILY.
2,not so good,"Amazon seems to have a problem with color blindness. The picture is for a silver clock but the fine print in the description says gold (which I found out later after I received it). I am not a happy camper! The clock required me to put it in the window to receive the signal. I have a Skyscan weather clock that doesn't have this problem which is why I purchased another Skyscan clock. The face is scratched and has glue all over it. The 2 center buttons for time zone did not function when I first received it and even after it got the signal and set itself. For some reason it worked once today and I was able to get it to set to central time. Amazon was once my first choice for shopping but now I start elsewhere due to overcharging for shipping, incorrect descriptions, and their decline in quality."
2,Automatic time set doesn't work,"Don't buy this clock to use in an office building. The ""atomic clock"" features don't work in mine. It wouldn't set itself correctly when I bought it, so I had to set it manually. Yesterday was the fall time change, and it didn't reset itself. Once it's set manually it keeps good time, but the way it's made makes setting it a bit difficult. The fine print on the directions says it won't work in a mall, and I guess that also applies to my two-story office building. I suspect it proabably also applies to appartment buildings."
2,Funny thing about this clock,"Clock worked fine for 2 weeks then one day I noticed the second hand wasn't moving. The clock still kept time but the second hand was stuck at 12 seconds. I tapped, replaced batteries, etc.. but no go. I did receive a replacement promptly from Amazon that has been working for a week now. Funny thing is I saw this same clock at a restaurant two days ago and its second hand was frozen. I even mentioned it to the waitress and she said it stopped moving about a month after they hung the clock. Same as mine the clock kept time. I guess in summary if you don't like to return items this might not be a good idea.Update:Replacement clock worked for about 3 weeks then the second hand froze at 28 seconds. This time Amazon will not replace but instead told me they have too many problems with this item and would rather refund my money. This thing is not worth your trouble. If I could I'd change my rating to 1 star."
1,Junk,This clock worked fine for about a month. Now both hands are stuck at 12:00. I have tried every suggestion on the manufacturer's web site and nothing works. This one goes in the trash can. Can anyone suggest a better choice?
1,this clock is JUNK,"ZERO STARS!!First of all, let me say that I bought this atomic clock because I've had others in the past and enjoy having the correct time. So I do know how to use one.This one, however, has been nothing but a headache. Upon set up it never did catch the signal, so we had to figure out how to set it manually, which is annoyingly difficult.When DST began, the clock did not change. Another headache resetting it.Today the thing went completely crazy and the hands just began racing around, never stopping. We took out the battery and reset it and then it began losing time.DON'T BUY IT!!!"
5,RECOMMENDED: SIMPLE TO SET UP; ACCURATE; UNIVERSALLY STYLED; LOW MAINTENANCE; SEE BELOW:,"I purchased this unit because my previous La Crosse Atomic Clock STOPPED WORKING. I will never buy another La Crosse. Not to mention the paper dial that contained the Roman numerals was warping/wrinkling. Now on to this item's review:I just wanted a clock that:1. Tells perfect time2. Looks nice for any type of environment3. Easy to set up4. Is low in maintenanceThis item fit all four requirements. I have no complaints and have been using the unit for 6+ months.JOEL'S RECOMMENDATION:If you are in the market for an atomic wall clock, this is the unit to purchase. If you are not too fond of the styling, just make sure you are purchasing this brand... stay away from La Crosse."
1,clock,"Didn't work had to send it back. The clock wouldn't even set. Very frustrating, followed instructions and it still didn't work."
5,Facts not Fiction,"TO ALL BUYERS....We are a group of MD Paranormal Investigators who document paranormal activity at haunted historic locations. We are self-funded and all proceeds gained from sales go towards the historic preservation effort. Our documentaries are real, unbiased and based on life experiences. If you are looking for Hollywood style ghost hunting, than our DVD's are not for you. The sales of any DVD's here on Amazon go towards the required gear / materials for our next investigation."
1,"Great Location, Poor Documentary","My review stays the same as the rest of this groups pseudo-paranormal investigating documentaries. An experienced team and cameraman. If you don't know the difference between real investigation, or a home-movie and a documentary, this MAY be for you. Otherwise, save the cash."
5,Unique book,"This is not one more book, but the foundation of a theory not yet understood and much more not yet accepted. It opens new frontiers in biology and life sciences. The role of electromagnetism is vital to the concept of life. Each cell should not be considered and studied as one unit, but as part of one organism (my though is that maybe the one organism should be considered as part of one ecosystem). If you are trying to answer how external electromagnetic fields can affect a living organism, then you will find unique the idea that field intensity is not the criterion. Weak fields can be more important than strong fields.Anyway, this book is classical and rare. It revolutionizes life sciences, enters unexplored regions. If you are a true scientist take it, if you can find it."
2,Not our style....,"I bought this book online and was quite disappointed. This was not at all what I expected. I wanted a cute book for my daughter and her father to read together, but this was just awkward. He felt weird reading the book due to the wording, and she didn't seem into it. We listened to the CD, and again just felt that this wasn't for us. If you are looking for a cute, sweet father/daughter book, this isn't it. I see that alot of people enjoy this book and CD, so I wouldn't say this isn't for everyone. I think it is just one of those books that people either love or don't."
1,Creepy,"This book is REALLY creepy. I really don't understand how it made it to the best seller list. We received the book as a gift but upon reading it, I'm donating it to Goodwill. Yuck!"
1,Breaks my heart...,"I bought this book for my husband for Father's Day, his first with our daughter. My heart literally broke as I read the page ""Won't You Dance With Me?"". The lines :""Of all the babies you're the fattest one, You big-leg women are a load of fun"" are horrifying. In a time and culture where girls are comparing them selves to images in magazines, where they are falsely made to think they need to be thin to be worthy of love and acceptance- who could possibly want to read these words to a young girl. I am returning this book and will boycot all things Garrison Keillor in the future."
5,Perfect and Adorable!!,"I ordered this book for my daughter to give her daddy on father's day. (She is a HUGE daddy's girl) Daddy isn't big on reading stories but he has read this to her and I read it myself before giving it to him. The story is completely adorable and I would recommend this to any ""Daddy's Girl"""
4,Sweet,"Being a fan of Garrison Keillor, I was excited to find this book to give my husband for his first Father's Day! There are a few phrases that may sound a bit odd, but that is partly the author's humor, and partly from viewpoint of an older generation. Just a notice to those who read the other reviews and thought the book automatically came with a CD like I thought - the boardbook does NOT come with a CD. I was very disappointed about that - would have loved to hear Garrison sing the songs!"
1,Disturbing,"I thought this would be a great book to give to my brother as he became a dad for the first time. However, when I read the book I just didn't feel comfortable giving it to him.A dad and a baby girl's book should be sweet and cuddly, but the image the words produced hit me slightly odd. Why should a dad talk about lifting his baby girl's legs and wiping in between?Perhaps I've been tainted by all of the devient TV out there these days, but it does sound a little Freudian."
1,Amazed this got published!,"Seriously? Ditto to all of the 1 star reviews.In fact, this should have a negative star on it to warn others.I am surprised this was published.This is no children's book - there are words in this book that children would not understand nor would parents want to explain at that age (ie ecstacy).There are plenty of other great books out there!"
4,Fun book-true to life- not sickly sweet,"I was really suprised to see so many negative reviews here. My whole family gets a kick out of this book. When I first saw the title ""Daddy's Girl"", I groaned inside. I was afraid it was going to be sickly sweet and tear jerking sentimental. Instead it is very real to life- this is how it is to have little kids people! You DO talk about wiping their bottoms, because you have to do it about 5 times a day for the next 5 years!(ever heard a parent refer to their little one's cute little ""tushie""? Did you ever think they were a sicko for saying it?)I recommend this as a great book for the modern day, hands-on, involved in parenting like he is supposed to be kind of dad. (and the CD is great too)"
4,Coolest Batman figure ever!! Except for one little thing....,"This Batman based on the WB show is awesome! He looks cool, he's got a pretty cool disk accessory, but...... I just wish they didn't mold the batarang to his forearm, It would be so much cooler if they made it removable! Aside from that it's the coolest looking batman figure I've ever seen."
4,A Really good read!,"An entertaining insight to WW2 POW conduct. One really gets into the characters, Reality? Not sure about about that but a good book to read.."
4,Amusing war story,"A light story about German prisoners of war in England about 1940. Very amusing but not great literature. Shows how absurd some of the rules and actions were. Similar, in some ways, to ""Catch 22"" but not as well done."
5,One of the best OTC ear washes available,"I am a first-time user of this product and after using several other OTC brands, I would say this is one of best pet ear washes available. I have not used the DRY but I can vouch for the WASH and I will be glad to keep this ear relief set in stock. It was packaged well and arrived within a couple of days. And the price is reasonable compared to some local pet stores' prices."
5,Great Stuff!,"This product worked beautifully to clean my puppy's ears. He was having signs of an infection, so I started using this product daily. The vet said it worked wonders and actually cleaned so well that it removed almost all bacteria from his ears. Highly recommend!"
1,Waste of Money,I used this for 3 days in my dogs ears. It made his ears very painful and even made them bleed. I do not recommend it. Wish I wouldn't have boughten it.
5,This Actually Works!,"I bought this stuff 6 months ago for my little Schnoodle who would get ear infections after just playing in the sprinklers. I started using this stuff after any water play and baths and sure enough, no more ear infections.We just recently got a large Weim who had earmites upon arrival. We started using ear mite droplets and then we found out she was allergic to the stuff. She was shaking her head so bad, the tips of her ears started to bleed. The inside of the ears were all red and puffy too. So sad to watch! We used this stuff on her and within an hour, she was hardly shaking her head and the redness had started to go away.It also immediately eliminates any smells, plus the dogs don't fight it because it doesn't sting.Completely and totally worth the $13 if you have a dog with ear issues!"
2,ok,These items were ok. I used it for a while but my dog started to have allergic reactions to it so had to stop using. Our chihuahua is very senstive though.
4,Very Nice Work,This album is a very nice piece of work by this new Brazilian talent. Paula Santoro has a beautiful voice and a nice repertoire.I recommend this album to those who enjoy Brazilian music.
5,"what I needed, what I expected.",I ordered what I needed and received what I expected.That's all I want from this.
1,not as advertised,"I have received two 512Mb sticks instead of 1 Gb stick.Buyers be warned you may receive something that you don't ask forMy laptop only have 2 slots and I ordered 2 of this items so I received 4 512Mb sticks, this is useless to me.I ordered directly from Amazon, other stores may ship the right item."
1,Not Happy.,"I also ordered this item but received the 512MB version rather than the 1GB version. My order was directly from Amazon. I returned it and promptly received a replacement - again 512MB not 1GB. So I sent that back, although to this point I have not received a replacement, a refund, or an explanation. I see that Amazon no longer stocks this item, as it is being sold through other vendors. I suspect that the inventory number was wrong at Amazon or something like that and they did not actually have this item in stock. Whatever."
5,"Great product, excellent seller service",Will gladly recommend both seller and product. Increased memory for my laptop doubled speed. Seller really delivered a great product for a very reasonable price and delivery was faster than predicted.
1,"Received 512Mb memory, beware!","I have received twice a 512Mb memory instead of the 1Gb memory that is advertised, be carefull."
2,The RAM is Double Sided,I tried to install this RAM in my Inspiron 5100 and no Dice. Did some checking and it looks like the laptop will only accept single sided RAM. This RAM being double sided cause the laptop to not boot and just flash the lights by the power button 9 times. The package says it's tested to be 100% compliant so I'm not sure what they tested it on. Be sure to check and make sure you're laptop can accept double sided RAM.
5,Quick simple upgrade. Trusted brand for reliability. Great price!,As usual Kingston provides their well known quality and reliability in their Memory products. I always trust Kingston for their memory and lifetime warranty. ValueRam also has a great price.
4,nice,these capsules do exactly what they promise to do and I got them at a reasonable price as well. thanks
5,Exceptional music!,"I bought this for my husband who is a huge King Biscuit Boy and Crowbar fan. This album doesn't disappoint the hard-core rock-and-roll good 'ol boys out there. So pop in the CD, crank it up and roll through the neighborhood enduring the frowns and stares of people who aren't nearly as cool as you!"
3,then if your so mad compare it to the power rangers dino crews blue raptor,"hey, i was not around since the begining og power rangers but they have changed to,, i mean blue dino raptor! i know and you know {hopefuly you know} this was not here since the begining. nowsure this ARTIC BATMAN thing is pretty dumb, it tops power rangersdino thingy, so if you are strugiling to decide between those 2go with this"
5,very helpful to me,"I originally got this book from a friend and started to read it later. I found useful information on Witchcraft and Aquarian-Age predictions. Her predictions were right; the gays prediction was correct, racism was correct, and Satan was correct. It also had good information on Astrology and Divination. Although she kept putting her likeness of White Magic in most of the chapters. She also told what requirements to become a Black or White Magician."
1,Completely Horrid,"When I first opened this book and started reading, I had a moment of Deja Vu. I brushed it aside and started reading. I should have paid attention to my instincts. This book is horrible. In fact, I had such an awful feeling after reading just a few chapters, I couldn't finish it. I read the reviews stating the ""Words of Power"" section is the main reason this book is purchased but I will not even glance at it. If I don't agree with this woman's philosophy, I want nothing to do with her ""Words of Power"". This book has gone by ""way of the fishes"". I burned it. I cannot with a clear conscious donate a book of pure crap."
1,Don't waste your time,"Ms. Weinsteins ""facts"" are atrociously outdated and/or flat out wrong. In addition to her belief in Margret Murray's theories that were proven to be false years ago, she also claims Wicca is a 5,000 year old Celtic Religion originating in Atlantis. If you're looking for fairytails then by all means order this book today. If you want accurate history and facts, this aint it."
1,"""New Age"" SewAge.... don't waste your time...","If you're into Aquarian nonsense and white-light occultism, faked history and silly rituals, enjoy- you've found your holy grail. On the other hand, if you have a serious interest in magickal practice and magic in historical context, take a look at the works of Stephen Edred Flowers (Hermetic Magic), Don Webb (Seven Faces of Darkness), and Aleister Crowley (Magick Without Tears)."
5,Magic 101,"I read this book in the 1980 when I was a student. Since then I have handed it as one of the first two books I give every student of mine. It is mandatory reading.Is it fluffy? Well, to some extent yes. There are some ""airy-fairy"" parts but overall, this book is solid groundwork for someone beginning their magical training. The ""10 Foot Pole"" chapter is always a discussion starter with my students."
4,A good intro to wichcraft,"This is a great book for the novice. There's nothing wrong with someone reading this book who is looking for a pagan intro. This book was one of my first 13+ years ago. I have since delved into witchcraft/paganism much, much deeper. Looking back, the advanced student will see the 'fluff', but we all need to start out gently on this path as it is not for everyone."
2,Small for Kolcraft portacrib mattress,"I usually love knit sheets and like Carters products, but these sheets barely fit around the Kolcraft portacrib mattress."
4,New way for animation,I love the combination of CG animation (character) and Drawing animation (background). Wait to see the next things like this
4,CGI Alice in Wonderland: meet your manga,"Purchased this for my kids on little more than a solid review from Cartoon Network. We were all pleasantly surprised.In terms of story, it is nothing groundbreaking (certainly not as inventive as SUMMER WARS, distributed here by the same company, a trailer for which appears on this disc) but the story is heartwarming nonetheless. There is a great deal of tragedy to this tale (deceased parents, lost memories of better times, childhood trinkets lost, etc) that is handled with the same deft touch often seen in films from Pixar. The personal loss is put across enough to resonate within dragging the more lighthearted elements down.And though much of the story also pivots Japanese culture, one need not know the difference between kami and shikigami to enjoy this tale of fox spirits and forgotten realms.Strongly Recommend"
4,no 3D...? Only in Germany 3D avail....?,It has been released in Germany in real 3D and i really like it....? Japanese with German Sub.but no english Sub.Pherhaps they will release it in USA in 3D too....? 4 big Stars...? Worth getting the 3D version if you can read German Subt. underneath BUT I belive in 2D its Awesome too....? Still 4 big deserving Stars...?
3,"Kinda stunk....... was ""OK""","well, story basicly stunk, and that white american actor that was that asteronaut stunk at acting.well, i would not recomend it unless your a collector or a ""DIE-HARD"" Godzilla fan....."
2,EMBARRASSING RETURN FOR GODZILLA'S GREATEST FOE,"After seeing GHIDORAH, THE THREE HEADED MONSTER, I was excited to see my personal favorite of Godzilla's enemies return. My opinion of this movie in two words- IT STINKS! The only parts worth watching are the short battles between Godzilla, Rodan , and Ghidorah. Otherwise the story is fairly boring and ludicrous. The idea of aliens trying to conquer earth using Ghidorah and/or some other monster(Gigan maybe)has been used in the series so much, the plots become very predictable, which of couse ruins the fun of the movie. Godzilla and Ghidorah did not fight as much as in this ones predecessor. And the acting was just plain bad. Godzilla did have some cool moments like the battle on Planet X when he does a funky and funny victory dance after roasting Ghidorah with his atomic ray. If you like cool Godzilla movies, skipping this one is worth your while."
1,Defective Tape.,I received a bad tape. Everytime I played the tape for five minutes it would go blank. On the outside of the tape was a messege that said (If you experience picture problems adjust tracking control). I played this tape on three different vcrs using the tracking control one with auto tracking and I still had the same problem. The tracking control didn't do any good. I've bought many movies from Amazon before but this is the only bad one I've got. The picture quality was perfect until it went blank.
3,GODZILLA VS. MONSTER ZERO,This verson is good but not as good as the GODZILLA BOX SET the box set has new seens and has been restored and has both JAPANISESS and ENGLISH VERSION.
2,Where's Mothra?,"Summary: Godzilla and Rodan fight for the preservation of earth when evil aliens incorporate Ghidrah into their plans for invasion.A virtual re-make of ""Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster"", minus Mothra. Film is a bit slow moving, but not entirely unenjoyable.Next is ""Godzilla Vs. the Sea Monster""."
4,Good Campy Fun,"Only time an American actor lands the lead role (Nick Adams). This one is one of my top 10 favorite Godzilla movies. Its not the best, but their is a nice feeling to it. Aliens from Planet X trick the people of the earth and monster-nap Godzilla and Rodan in order to take over the planet. Includes the infamous Godzilla victory dance! Nicely done."
3,Better than people say,"Hey, it isn't the best and it isn't the worst. This ranks somewhere in the middle of the Toho Godzilla epics, where Godzilla is starting to transform into our favorite 1970's japanese superhero. It's a middle class Toho monster movie effort with an okay script, a so so cast, okay effects. Rodan was an expected but cool addition also ( even though the Rodan costume looks like an idiot in this feature ). The aliens are one of the best aliens in the Toho series. Compared to the aliens from ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" or ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"", these are really evil aliens that have cool ships and evil minds as trick the world to give them Godzilla and Rodan for there fake cure for all of worlds desieses. Ghidorah is one of the most awsome creations from the Toho studios, but he isn't very great in this film. He moves kind of dopey for some reason, it looks like his heads have fallen off the ropes in some scenes. All in all, 3 1/2 stars."
5,The Best Godzilla Film ever!,"The ultimate, surreal Godzilla film ever. I own this DVD version and I don't even have a player! A must have. It looks so ""now"" and and an obvious influence on ""Mars Attacks"". I've seen this film about 50 times - and I can proudly say, I get more stupid every time. If you have'nt seen it, you have'nt lived!"
1,Skip this book and go to Knit Lit Two,"I read Knit Lit two first and loved it. The stories were funny and touching and varied. I laughed outloud at some and cried with others. So I bought the first one, Book Lit, and was very disappointed. Start with Book Lit Two, skip this one."
5,Laughed out loud in the store,"and rushed over to the cashier to pay so that I could take it home right then. If you are a knitter, you will recognize yourself. Lots of funny stories about knitting, and life. Buy it."
5,Excellent Scary Music,"From one of my favorite directors, the late great Dan Curtis, comes this collection of some of his best movies composed by Robert Cobert. It reminds you how important music was in making these movies more effective. Very good collection and worth the price."
3,Nice book,"This book we used when we were travelling last week. It was nice, consumed some of the time in the activities but needed adult help to explain what to be done and read the instructions for her, she is only 5.5 years old. But generally speaking, it is nice."
4,This book will help with killing time...,"but for being from Rand McNally, I was really hoping for more of a map or atlas. You'll need one of these for each child because they have to write in them, so you can't reuse them. It does get the job done as far as giving the kids something to do, but I prefer the National Geographic Kids Ultimate U.S. Road Trip Atlas: Maps, Games, Activities and More for Hours of Backseat Fun. This has activities that can be done over and over again on your trip, has maps of each state and interesting facts about each and you'll only need one for the whole car."
2,Breezy and banal,"2 1/2Another set of loopy, eccentric pop becomes even more forgettable and disposable then previous outings. Worth a sampling for many of the fragmented ideas the band incorporates when playing off of different styles of music, but lacking a solid backbone to distinguish these ditties above lighthearted experimental fluff."
3,ITS ALL HYPE! THIS IS JUST A TEASE!,"I love and always be a fan of Masters of the Universe, but this is outrageous. Its good to see He-Man and the old gang back again this time on DVD, but 10 episodes out of 170+ that was made? Why is it so hard to get anything related to this franchise, action figures? complete DVD series? I am very dissapointed because the episodes are the ten best, so guess what there is no continuity, it is just a tease, all hype. They need to bring the whole season in a collectors set just like they should do with the 2003 short lived series! If you don't really care about a complete set and will just settle for 10 mere episodes of one of the best animated series of all time then buy this collectors set, other than that just rent it and wait and pray for the real deal."
3,"Not a fan, but picked it up anyway...","I'm not a huge fan of He-man, but I like it enough to pick up the best of DVD. I won't be picking up the volume dvd's."
3,Opportunism Not Greatness,"""...she could do some real good, and at a crucial time, and doesn't"" writes Peggy Noonan about Hillary Clinton as she describes the former First Lady's obsession with style and image over substance. This short book criticizes the ""narcissism"" of the Clintons and their need for power and adulation. Noonan mentions the various scandals and political power plays but it is a stretch to claim a ""case"" is put together. It may reinforce the feelings of those already put off by Ms. Clinton but I doubt it will convince any Hillary fans to become members of the vast right wing conspiracy.The book is somewhat unsatisfying in its' lack of detail and superficiality, no index, no photographs and no notes. However, admirers of Peggy Noonan -- I am one -- will find it a quick and entertaining read."
2,tiresome and trite,"i cannot tell you how boring, boooooring, i found this book. for a non-american forced by proximity if by nothing else to keep track of america and fascinated by american politics in the same way i might be by bear-baiting, this book is emblematic of american politics. here is a relatively intelligent former-participant in american politics, able, one supposes, to provide some sort of disinterested perspective, who, rather than add anything to the discourse, preaches to the converted; republicans will love this book (for it's title if nothing else) and democrats won't. anybody else, looking to understand, not polemicize (is that a word?), will be BORED."
1,Consumed with hatred,"I learned nothing new about Hillary Clinton. Noonan has included lots of far out unproven allegations she has lifted from Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. She wants us to accept them as fact. She has also put words in Mrs Clinton's mouth in the form of imaginary conversations. Peggy Noonan has invented conversations to prove Mrs Clinton is evil. What does that say about Peggy Noonan? She also has utter contempt for voters for not following her ""wisdom"". This book is not about Hillary Clinton. It is about Peggy Noonan. She comes across as another Marie Antoinette."
1,Noonan's Fiction,"This book was the worst case of editorial fiction I have ever read. Ms. Noonan, apparently snubbed at some point by HRC and out to get revenge, tells us why we (New Yorkers, in the short term, and the US at large in the long term) should not vote for HRC. However, Noonan does not present facts. She peppers the book with phrases such as: ""Let us speculate"" what HRC will do if she were to become senator (president). ""Perhaps a conversation with HRC might go like this . . . "" It is true that a few facts are included, but most are Noonan's very biased thoughts transposed as HRC's. I could not finish reading the book. I was tired enough of mud slinging from the recent campaigns. I did not need to read fictionalized bashing, whether you, me, or Noonan like HRC's political views or not."
1,Full of Right Wing Venom,This book is only recommended for people interested in studying how authors deal with subjects when they are motivated by deep seated envy and hatred.The book is a statement about Peggy Noonan rather than a study of Hillary Clinton. Read it only if you want to understand how right-wingers feel about socially progressive politicians.
1,just another hatchet job,"Noonan's book on her experience as a Reagan speech writer was a wonderful book. One need not turn misty-eyed or view Sen Clinton thru rose colored glasses, to conclude that Noonan's book is just another vile tract from the ""get Bill, get Hillary"" camp of late-night cable TV right-wingers. Talk about ""politics of personal destruction""! Hillary was dead-on accurate about the vast right wing conspiracy, judging from this unpleasant work. I hope Noonan will turn her considerable skills on other ""character"" issues -- may those on her side of the street: e.g., ""W"" getting rich off the Texas Rangers (just imagine what they would have to Hillary if she had turned $600,000 to $13mil with the help of her daddy's buddies; and the dirty job done on Sen. mccain during the primaries, etc. Gee, suppose Hillary had done what Linda Chavez did -- break the law, lie to the vetting group .... it would keep the late night ""get Bill, get Hillary"" crowd busy for years! Peggy: get a life."
5,Ms Noonan surpasses,"A balanced well written book that gives insight into the ""power desire"" -- that woman, -- Hillary Clinton has. I first heard of the book from the O'Rielly report on Fox News. Very easy to read. I have mailed it to my daughter in NY."
5,The Whole Truth And Nothing But The Truth,"Finally, someone speaks out and tells the true store of Clintonism. Peggy Noonon is a talented author who spent a great deal of time an research to uncover all of the devious tricks that have been pulled on us by the Clintons since 1992. I realize now why the people of Arkansas wanted the Clintons to move to Washington. This book tells the story like no other. Buy it now before its too late!"
1,peggy goes 'dutch',"this whole book is full of inventions [just like edwin morris' much dissed 'dutch'], projections, and no solid reporting... to ask 25 beans for this is robbery.... but hey gotta make a buck somewhere...as for [gasp!] the idea that she might use her senate seat to run for president, why do you think that rudy is running?being a senator is not a executive job... it's more theory creating and speech making than decision making...."
1,"One More Piece of the ""Vast Conspiracy""","Having just finished reading 'The Hunting of the President', I am sensitized to the possibility that all too much of the media is out to make a political point rather than to create a truly informative narrative. `The Case Against Hillary' unfortunately, is one of the most flagrant examples of character assassination that has ever been seen in print. The `politics of personal destruction' is so evident here that it is surprising that anyone would take this book any more seriously than Professional Wrestling. When a book that pretends to give insight into the life of another, turns out to be just a long psycobabble speculation at best... It just isn't a book worth reading unless you are in the mood for a political trip into some fictional fantasy."
1,The Case Against Hillary Clinton,"Ms. Noonan is the same ""author?"" who forgot to write about Ronald Reagan's involvement in the Iran-Contra affair. She writes about Clintonism, I personally am tired of ""Noonanism."" She appears to be a very bitter and cynical person. I would not recommend her book. I prefer ""The Little Red Hen."""
2,Dissapointing,"Just to clear the air I am politically what you would consider middle-of-the-road. As a voter in New York's upcoming Senate elections I therefore picked up this book with some hope of getting some insight into Hillary Clinton. Instead this book was just a diatribe against her without any new insight or new information. Clearly, Ms. Noonan (the former speechwriter of President Reagan)does not like the Clintons but what else does she have to say? not much. If you are looking for a book that intelligently discusses the impeachment turn to Posner's ""An Affair of State."" If you are looking for a good insightful book on the Clinton Presidency and Hillary - keep waiting."
1,an indeptly-written vendetta,"Ms. Noonan hasn't gotten over her prediction that Bill Clinton would lose reelection. She's now taking it out on his wife in goopy, biased prose. Don't waste your money on this tripe."
1,Hate from the right,"Noonans Reaganite hate of the Clintons spews forth from the pages of this book. Based on a few facts and lots of rumours and accusations this book would be considered libelous in many villages of the world. Why this group HATES continues to puzzle me. We can find ""lies"" from every politicien from Caeser to Clinton... in fact today's newsbite political arena almost demands it.This book will sell a few copies to the right wing and to a few 'open minded' types... but it offers no real information. You'd be better off to do your own research... Peggy Noonan can write, but she can't remove the personal venom based on her love of RR."
2,Another One-sided Partisan Attack,"Or is it just personal (because of jealousy)? Its hard to judge emotion from the pages of a short book. Peggy was infamous for her support or Reagan and his lies (even if he was a senile puppet).You should consider the source. Although I am not from NY, I wouldn't vote for a person who was put in office as part of the deal to cover-up the ""accidental death"" of JFK Jr (IMHO)."
1,The Case Against Hillary Clinton,Peggy Noonan is as unbiased towards Hillary Clinton as she is towards Anita Hill. She needs a reality check.
5,A must read!,"In what is is an intellectual yet straightforward argument, Ms. Noonan has written a book that I just couldn't put down. Objectively, I think Ms. Noonan has captured the very essence of Hillary Clinton and has done so in a fair, non-gossipy manner. Indeed, she backs her argument with facts which make her opinion all the more persuasive. Every New Yorker -- rather every American -- should consider this a must read!"
5,Thank God for the Truth,"Noonan has done a wonderful job of describing what most of us have come to know over the last seven years. I thank God that someone has put into words what Clintonism and its founders have done to this country. This is a must read for anyone who wants the unvarnished truth about Hillary Clinton, and without the left-leaning filtering that the media usually performs when it comes to the Clintons."
4,Once a Commoner,"Beware, New York, beware! In her trenchant ""tribute"" to the ubiqitous Hillary Clinton, Peggy Noonan heaps some well-deserved opprobrium on this woman with the acquired sense of entitlement, this ""selfless"" woman who is ""running [for a US Senate seat (NY)] for the children."" Noonan cogently details what eight years of Clintonism have built: A seamy, tawdry, Camelot-knockoff. Would-be Senator, you're no Jackie Kennedy! (Oh, please...can we focus on the issues and get back to doing the work of the people of New York?) Bottom-line: There are no coincidences in the Clinton White House. And as for some reviewers calling Noonan's blunt work a ""screed"" and ""character assassination,"" Hillary needs no help from Ms. Noonan. She's done very well on her own."
1,More disgusting writing from a disgusting human being,"All she can do is rail against others. No redeeming qualities herself so she has to lash out. Noonan, get a life!The Clinton years - the best in the history of the USA! I felt safe and financially secure until Bush took office and Clintons left. All you have to do is look at the state of the union during and after the Clintons. You can't argue with facts unless you are simply a propagandist not interested in the facts.Bush will destroy this country and the during Clinton administration it was never better."
1,Noonan Nooner,"This book, written with gusto by a creative phoney, is the latest of a long, never-ending list of books by those tiresome, monotonous Clinton Haters whose incomes seem to be dependant on the misfortunes of others. She tells us absolutely nothing that we did not know, except of course, details of the ""imaginary events"" she THINKS may have occurred. ""BOO! Hillary's gonna getcha!"" Her tone is snide, and her words are heavily dipped in the leftover aura of her obsessive love affair with the Reagans and the Bushes who probably put her up to this. I borrowed this book. Otherwise, I'd be asking for a refund."
1,"I'd have given the book no stars, but that's not an option","The ability to write is a great gift and no one can deny that Ms. Noonan has a gift. Having said that, I found her gift used to trash someone for whom she has only contempt (I'll take her word that she does not hate Mrs. Clinton). Does this book bring anything new to the discussion? No. Does the book bring any insight? No. This book is a screed, full of sanctimony and condescension. I also find her use of imaginary conversations and thoughts disingenuous; is this not the writer who condemned Edmond Morris for the practice? Ms. Noonan is just another of those blinded by partisanship and/or hate for anything Clinton. My advice--grow up."
1,Whine from sour grapes,"Former Reagan/Bush speachwriter Peggy Noonan is one of the manysore losers who should be spending their time apologizing for thecampaign of lies and unfounded accusations that have characterized their campaign of Orwellian ""Truthspeak"". Even Peggy's former co-worker, Ken Starr, with an unlimited budget, time, and agenda, could not find any facts or proof to substantiate the claims made in this book. But no matter. Peg has a job to do here, and she's not going to let a little thing like facts or accuracy get in her way. Recommended reading for right-wing ostriches who refuse to pull their heads out of their, er, sand. END"
1,"You can have your opinion, but...","I love reading differing intelligent discussions of opinions on relevant issues, but this was not it. Noonan's assertion that she does not hate Clinton is a bigger bit of bull than everything she later says about Clinton. I pride myself on being a staunch independent, but this book could steer me from Republican opinions for years to come (nothing but partisan ramblings) not to mention the worse sin of the lot...it's boring.For all who think that this should influence us in New York, remember that the most popular book on her opponent is ""Nasty Man"". If you have an opinion of who we should pick, why don't you read the NY Times and see the headlines about what Rudy is up to before you tell us who we should or shouldn't vote for.You can have your opinion, but don't be so stupid as to think that it's worth my 20 bucks."
2,Disappointing effort by a good writer,"I was looking forward to reading this book because I admire Peggy Noonan's gifted writing skills and I certainly agree with the premise of the book. But, this book seemed to me to not present enough material to justify being published. I think she had enough good material to produce a very fine magazine article or series of 2-3 articles, but, I guess she and her agent had sold a publisher on a book deal. By the time she gets through trying to stretch her ideas into a short book, the result is not pretty. Was she just lazy or couldn't she come up with more solid material? The travel office material was very good, but, not much else was up to that quality level.Overall, a lost opportunity to speak out well on the issues and a lot of lost credibility for the author."
1,Startling!,"This book should be listed as fiction. Most of it is imaginary. I do not understand. If this were a homework assignment, it would be in Creative Writing class. How did Ms. Noonan and the publisher justify this work?"
1,Cash for Slander,The number of writers that would jump on the slander bandwagon is amazing. There is no honest attempt to represent the facts; just to make money. Will Ms. Noonan write about Enron and it's supporters in the administrations.
1,Oh please....,I would have given this book no stars if it were an option. It's sad that someone so well known is trying to make a name for herself at the expense of another.
3,The Soul Of Hillary,"This is a good but flawed book. It was not meant to be a fair book but rather a polemic. A polemic against a person of bad character in a position of public trust is a service to the public. Noonan grasps the core values of Hillary and displays them clearly for us all to see: It's all about Hillary. It's not about the United States. It's not about the various constituencies whose issues she milks. It's not about honesty. It's just about power for Hillary, a woman whose values are vastly different and inferior to the common man or woman on the street. Even though I share Noonan's disdain, even contempt, for the Clintons I thought that the passage that depicted an imaginary speech by Hillary to the Hollywood powers was disengenuous. There is plenty of perfectly awful evidence at hand with which to indict this malicious woman without recourse to fiction."
5,The Case Against Hillary Clinton,"Beautifully written with intelligence, wit, clarity and charm. A must read for anyone interested in our country."
5,Hillary Clinton should read this,"This is a straightforward, no-nonsense book that is the best of it's kind. The writing is dynamite. The techniques used to tell the story and make points are superb. If Mrs. Clinton read this book she could learn an enormous amount about herself and her public. The book is an easy read and goes right to the point of each issue. I've read dozens of books on the Clintons - and this is by far the best. Ms. Noonan doesn't belabor the points nor does she smear Mrs. Clinton. She is honest and forthcoming about her perspective and supports it with hard hitting evidence. The best review I've seen about this enigmatic lady. Please, New Yorker's, read this book!"
1,Noonan: A case against Hillary Clinton,"How can anybody like Peggy Noonan formally writing for Reagan and Bush, have the guts to write a book about a person she donsen't know and don't like. It's obvious that Peggy Noonan want to make a buck, do you really want to read speculation and invented thoughts about Hillary Clinton. It really tell me all about the GOP's wanting to smear anybody who will not play their game... If I wan't to read nonsense like this I would save my money and buy National Enquire or Global, or some such..."
1,Peggy Noonan in a new role,"I have read other Noonan books. They were related to her experiences and skills, and offered considerable insight. But now she has taken on the role of stalker for the Republicans. Nothing new here, nothing very interesting either. Peggy, we hardly knew ye."
1,Not One Original Thought,I bought this book hoping I might get some insight into the emotions and life of a First Lady. Instead it is a hatchet job just like that Olsen book. What a hack.
1,"Kinder, Gentler, Shallower","Ms. Noonan's random, pretentious musings on the First Lady read like Sean Hanity with a thesaurus. What you get by the end of this book is a facile collection of built-up resentments and petty gripes. It's too bad Noonan takes the Clinton's so personally. It's not their fault Peggy, it's yours."
1,More of the hate mongers at work!,"This book is amazing in only one respect--does Peggy Noonan think we don't know her for her right wing agenda already? She clearly is jealous of our First Lady and tries to make her appear wrong or bad in every instance. This simply is counter- intuitive to anyone with an iota of intelligence. However, the hatemongers and vitriolic sorts will love this and buy it up! I would never pay money for it and will advise my public library system not to waste taxpayer money on it."
2,Where are the facts?,"Ms. Noonan's book about Hilary Clinton was very disappointing. I looked forward to reading it and by the end of the first chapter, I realized that fantasy scenarios prevaled. The author would state an event in the past and then project that into an imagined event in the future. Because of Mrs. Clinton's actions in the past, she will a certain way in the future. For instance, in an elaborate way, the author goes into great detail when she tells of Hilary's response to her election in November of 2000. As a result, the book left me very disappointed. Since Ms. Noonan had personal experience with Hilary, I was hoping that she would narrate these experiences only. Fantasy had no place in her book."
3,Good premises but too many drawn out scenarios,"I like the premise of this book. There is indeed a strong case to be made against Hillary Clinton and at times, Noonan makes it well. Unfortunately, Noonan too often tries to get into Hillary's head and launches into extended imaginary conversations Hillary has with herself. Noonan also creates other imaginary scenarios which detract from the book. These scenarios border on the surreal and guessing what Hillary may be thinking does not make the case against her. Noonan is at her best when she sticks to the facts and analyzes Hillary's record such as Hillary's alleged commitment to children. The book is still worth reading but I do not give it more than a moderate recommendation."
2,"Interesting book, poorly written","Let me first state that I am no fan of the Clintons, Bill or Hillary. I believe that he is both a liar and predator and that she is his chief enabler. Therefore, books (and articles) that are negative about either of them attract me.However, although I found Peggy Noonan's book very interesting (and quite clever in a few spots), I also thought that it defined for me the term ""screed"". It may be well researched but it is not well written. It has all the appearance of having been hastily dashed off to get to market in a hurry."
1,A more embittered author I haven't seen in a long time...,"It's been a long while since I've seen anyone as bitter or as clearly irrational as Peggy Noonan. As one reads portions of this book or watches her present herself on the Judith Regan show (as she did recently), one is just struck with how deeply this woman truly does hate the subject of her book. In spite of what she may say, her words speak loud and clear, not on the subject of Hillary Clinton, but on... Peggy Noonan. It's my hope that this book goes largely unread. Reading it feels in some ways like how it feels to read neoNazi propaganda: the reader is given a glimpse into how dark and irrational the human heart can become when it chooses to hate something or someone. The reader is left depressed and anxious -- and nervous that others may be actually taken in by someone so clearly full of hatred."
1,GOP 101....Write A Book Which Psychoanalizes Hillary Clinton,"As a recent review of this book by Sean Elder points out, the book appears to be the required homework assignment of the GOP loyalty squad. As with the entire current genre of Hillary tomes, ""The Case Against Hillary Clinton"" adds nothing but speculation about the writer's obsession.Face it, the tries to peel away layers of the ""real"" Hillary. But how does it do this? On a slew of opinion articles written by mostly other GOP operatives.Ms. Noonan destroyed her credibility when she wrote President Reagan's contra speech. In it, you might recall, she referred to the contras as ""freedom fighters...like our founding fathers."" Well, we have since found the contras to be more like our founding Godfathers. This book does nothing to restore her credibility."
1,Undiluted poison,I read this book hoping to learn more about the First Lady from someone with a critical eye. I learned nothing about Hillary Clinton reading this book. I learned a great deal about Peggy Noonan and it is not a pretty picture. Miss Noonan seems to have total contempt for democracy. She simply cannot accept the fact that her president was defeated by We the People. She has never gotten over it. The book is full of innuendo half truths and rumors lifted form Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. Miss Noonan wants us to accept lies from less than credible sources as fact. Ironically after reading this book I have more respect for Mrs Clinton. She is lucky in her enemies.
2,Great Disappointment!,"I have been a respecter of Peggy Noonan and a Hillary Hater for many years but found the book to be a big disappointment. I wanted more facts to back up my feelings for Hillary, but instead Peggy Noonan's book is filled with speculation about what Hillary and others are thinking at any given moment or situation. It is stricktly a good guess to put into dialoge what is going on in someone else head! And the chapter that was ""a dream"" clinched it for me! Unexcuseable! I'll keep searching for the info I need."
3,Could've been better,"I picked up this book (actually audio cassette) to learn more about Hillary and, perhaps, confirm my suspicions that Hillary is not exactly the most honest of people. I enjoyed the book but was not overly impressed with Peggy Noonan's style of writing. I enjoyed the stories about Hillary's manipulating others and the ""case"" Noonan builds to support her premise that Hillary is a self-serving, lying, career politician. In support of these great stories she goes on and on about how disgusted she is with Hillary and why the New York voters should consider before they vote. Not being a Hillary supporter myself, I don't mind a a small amount of preaching but cut out the preaching and the book is about 80 pages long. I prefer Noonan's and others' personal experiences and anecdotes with the Clintons. Oh this book does, by the way, confirm my suspicions."
1,Sour Grapes,"Though Peggy Noonan attempts to make a case against Hillary Clinton, all this book accomplishes is a case against Peggy Noonan. Ms. Noonan shows herself to be a bitter woman with a modicum of writing talent. The Case Against Hillary Clinton doesn't even rise to the level of mere propoganda...it's nothing more than slander from a woman who is clearly jealous of Hillary Clinton's eloquence and success."
1,whatever happened to objectivity?,"Another stream of poison adding to the vast river of irrational hatred against the Clintons. Short on facts, long on make-believe ""dialogue"" and ""real motivation"" written exclusively to cash in on the lucrative anti-Clinton industry, by a petty woman who has given up any credibility she may have once had as an intelligent commentator on the political scene. Bile with no redeeming value whatsoever."
1,Speculation as Fact.,"I am glad that this book is in the library and I did not pay for it. I do not care if a person hates or loves the First Lady. But I do care when facts and arguements are not hand in hand. If lies are such a big concern for her, where are the books to condemn Reagan and Bush? This book seems to be nothing more then bitterness in writing. Where are the facts to back up statements. I believe in being fair. I think the Clintons have made some mistakes. But they are small compared to the past two Presidents. They did not start a war to remove a drug lord that was supported strongly by the last two predidents. They did not sell illegal arms to hostile nations. Let us get a perspective. Hillary may not be a warm caring person but she is smart."
4,The truth about socialism,"Although we can poke fun at anyone, Peggy Noonan's observations are more precise than not. The truth is, there are those who wish to conquer and control and will sell your freedoms to do so. Hillary Clinton is one such socialist and completely out of touch with the real American. Thank you Peggy for your recognition of the malevolence."
5,A must read for all democrats,"As a democrat who entusiastically voted for Bill Clinton the first time, and with slight hesitation the second time, I consider this book to be, among others, a must-read. Ms. Noonan has presented her argument cogently. Much as it saddens me to say, this book echoes the view of Hillary Clinton I slowly came to admit to myself with reluctance over the course of 8 years. If you find yourself with misgivings concerning the nature of the Clintons, read this book. Finally, in the end, we'll all have to face the true nature of these people, I suppose. Books like Ms. Noonan's are the first stage of the healing process."
2,bad ending to a phenomenal series,"I read the entire series from wagons west to the Holts. To have a book like this end the series the way it did was disheartening at best. Characters which grew up on the pages of countless books were killed off nonchalantly (Toby, Rob, etc.) or completely forgotten (Henry, Cindy, Midge). 34 great books and one very average book. I wish I had stopped one book short of the end."
1,A disappointment in an otherwise wonderful series,"After reading the whole series up to this point, I had been anticipating reading this finale. I was so disappointed in the lack of depth and the omission of some of the characters I'd been interested in in the previous books. Whatever happened to Janessa and Charlie Lawrence and their children? What about Eden and Michael Holt? In addition, I found this book rather depressing."
3,Awakened but Disappointed!!,I too have read every book in all the series by Dana Fuller Ross. Cannot understand why in most cases each of the previous books only one or two years were covered and now all of a sudden there are decades covered in the one book (1901-1941). I thought that there would be at least an Awakenings 2-3-4 etc. which would lead right up to the present day.I guess the reason that the quality of the writing may have changed in the books because according to information I got at the local library someone else was writing under the name of Dana Fuller Ross as the original man who used the name Dana Fuller Ross passed away in 1976.
1,I wish I could rate it 0 stars,"Others have said it, and so will I; the series could have done with 1 less book...this one.It is obvious Ross just wanted to be rid of his characters. ""Nonchalantly killed"" is understating it. Morosly killing off Toby and Alexandra was not needed. Plus, all 3 main characters ended up wasting their lives. Had Ross decided to give Frank Blake a chance to successfully impacted Panama, and left it there, it would have been a finer book. Instead, years pass by with no real impact, and this book is a travesty."
4,I liked it!,"I, too, read the entire series but almost didn't read Awakening because of the negative reviews. Fortunately, I'm somewhat obsessive-compulsive and couldn't NOT read the closing novel. I enjoyed it as I did the others, and realize that not every character that had been presented in the past could be addressed in this book. It was mainly about Sally and India and Frank, and that was fine with me. Maybe we need additional closure in the form of another series, eh, Miss Ross?"
1,Disappointed and bereft,First started the wagons west series in the 1980s ... moved to London and started collecting the whole series .... this book was the worst .... could not believe how shallow and meaningless the characters were. Could have given it a lot more life.
1,Excuse me?,"I have read every single one of the Wagons West & Holts books, and I was very disappointed with this one. It seemed to be very rushed to me. Entire years happened in pages, and people died right and left. I didn't like it at all. I think it could have been a lot better. It was like the series just needed to end, and the author rushed it out. I don't think I'll ever read it again. Also, FYI, Dana Fuller Ross is a man. His real name is James Something. Just found that interesting."
4,must have for any college football fan,"Alot if the clips in this DVD have been seen in other simliar dvds. There are alot of intresting interviews and a ton of clips from bo's coaching days. If you are a Michigan fan, or even just a collage football fan in general you will enjoy this overview of Bo Schembechler's career. The bonus features are really cool too. good stuff"
5,An Excellent and Absorbing Book,An intriguing story with a powerful message. What could have been a very complex and dreary subject--legal proceedings over the U.N. attempting to enforce a treaty regarding children supreceding the laws of the United States--is made alive and interesting. The author captures the real feel and attitudes of the kinds of people who are committed spiritually to Christian values while showing that the threat goes far beyond such people. The subplots are engaging and essential to humanize the characters. The role of the internet and chat rooms is both amusing and enlightening. The ultimate message of the book comes through vividly: there is a genuine and serious threat to American sovereignty by ratifying treaties that invade the personal lives of Americans.
4,Had him as a teacher,If you're at all interested in Latin American culture you'll love this book and he's an amazing person. He'll tal kto you forever about the subject and he's highly intelligent.
4,Perfect for 4 year old birthday party,My son was begging for a Spiderman cake. We got this pan and found the icing kit at Michaels. Pretty much like a paint by number. It was a lot of fun to decorate and he loved it!
4,Exact replacement cabin air filter for 2004 Toyota Camry SE,"I was looking for a replacement cabin air filter for my wife's 2004 Toyota Camry SE, but the dealer wanted nearly $30 plus tax. Bought this one here for $14.xx with no tax and free prime shipping. It is a perfect fit, and looks just like the OEM filter it is replacing."
1,Poor edition from ReadaClassic,"Although I find the Sherman's memoirs interesting, I would not recommend the ReadaClassic edition. There are quite a few minor and major typos throughout the book. For example in the Table of Contents and in the actual chapters it states: ""Chapter 12: Memphis to Arkansas Post. July to January 1882-1888."" Of course, what is meant is 1862-1863. This is repeated in the actual chapters although Sherman's actual writing uses 1862. There are other ridiculous minor typos which mar this edition. So if you want to read Sherman, find other editions than from ReadaClassic.com."
5,Sherman - A God of War,"Not only did I enjoy hearing about General Sherman's life, I enjoyed hearing it from the voice of such a great patriot. You cannot be more enthralled by any book but this."
4,Sherman's own perspective: surprisingly riveting,"William T. Sherman was one of the most fascinating, unique characters of the American Civil War. Explosive, profane and brilliant, he was surprisingly cautious on the battlefield and never incured the casualities of either Lee or Grant. Sherman's strength was in manouvering to avoid combat and he generally succeeded.So, how does Sherman hold up as a writer? Surprisingly well. Though the book is not as well-written as Ulysses S. Grant's Personal Memoirs, it is still a solid, riveting piece of work. A small criticism is that Sherman included copious amounts of correspondence which are printed in small letters at the bottom of many pages. The correspondence is frquently difficult to decipher and not especially edifying. The acual text, however, is stellar. Highly recommended."
4,A Remarkable Book by a Remarkanle Man,"Sherman wrote well.Compared to the flowery prose of others from this era, Sherman uses clear and simple words that carry well to the modern age. Further, he has a fascinating story to tell of shipwrecks, banking disasters, gold discoveries and then of course The War.I would recommend this to those who are already more than familiar with the American Civil War. What we see here is one man's view and you need to understand that he had his own opinions.The Battle of Chattanooga is perhaps the most obvious example of this. Was Sherman's attack really the cause the Rebel center collapsed? He seems to have honestly thought so. Most scholars take exception.This is simply a limitation of the memoir form. You should not take all that he has written as historical fact, but as the honest recollections of a man who was there at the critical moments of the War.I recommend it. At its best, it is like reading a letter from a long-gone uncle about his long-ago adventures."
5,A breath of fresh air...,"Kim has the track record of success that deserves immediate respect and through her training methods she makes networking marketing fun again. She tells the truth about the numbers game. This is by far the best book I have read in the field of direct sales in the last 10 years. She allows you to get prepared for cold and warm markets by telling your personal ""hot button"" story and going for that market niche'. Kudos to Kim for being real and NO hype. I'm 100% sold.Joe H (...)"
4,Jesus as Teacher,"Too often we get caught in one view of Jesus or another, and this particular book is an excellent way of viewing Jesus from the perspective of teacher.Without minimizing His role in salvation, this book gives us a better glimpse of what Jesus might look like if we encountered Him in our own lives, while demonstrating how he was viewed in His own time.It is organized as:Jesus as First-Century RabbiJesus as Charismatic TeacherJesus as Subversive SageJesus as Transforming TeacherJesus as Lover of QuestionsJesus as Risen RabbiThe Teacher is Here and is Calling for YouThey Had Been With JesusBest of all is an included song called ""You Say a Teacher He Can Be?"" to the tune of O WALY WALY, LM, a familiar tune to most of us.This book, organized in eight chapters might be good to use as a Bible Study, or to organize a series of sermons on this subject, particularly with the included song.I found the book an encouragement and eye-opener."
3,One of my 4000 Books,"The emphasis of this book is that we should call Jesus ""Rabbi"" or ""Teacher"" and approach Him in prayer and Bible reading looking for Him to teach us. I basically agree, but a summary of this idea might have made a good subject for a chapter of a book, but not a whole book by itself.The chapters were also poorly written, poorly organized, and repetative. There are other books out there which emphasize the Jewishness of Jesus which would be better."
2,Two zip ties and a piece of wood,"This product secures a 1x2 piece of wood to your bannister with two large zip ties. The theory is that it creates a plumb surfaced onto which to mount the gate. It did not seem particularly stable, and, ironically the zip ties scratched up our bannister (the whole point of this purchase was to protect our bannister from the ill effects of having kids). Anyway, a much safer and secure bannister installation kit isKidco Gate Installation Kitwhich clamps on the bannister."
3,"Simple, but effective...","I used the installation kit so I wouldn't have to drill holes in my the post of my stair rail. You can buy everything that comes in the kit at your local hardware store, but if you don't feel like wasting the time to go shop for the different pieces, then the kit is an easy solution."
1,waste of $,"save yourself time and money, and get what you need from the hardware store. i didn't bother with this kit, and am happy with my own mounting job around my iron bannister. total cost: $2.80. just double check your measurements to make sure the wood is long enough for the mounting bracketsagree with first review that the screws that they provided with the gate itself are cheap--i had 2 break. you would think for a $80+ dollar gate they could splurge for some real screws..cheap chinese junk grumble grumble"
3,"works well if you want to drill into the wall, otherwise, don't buy","My husband and I got this thinking that we needed to mount our gate to the wall. after fiddling with it for some time, we gave up on mounting it and used the tension bars instead. the product is a little confusing to assemble and the gates, for the most part, do not need to be mounted to the wall to work well."
2,Change of Tempo,"This collection of songs is very different from Al Martino's usual love songs. There is a latin flavor with drums that intrude. The back-up singers get into and interrupt his singing. Al's voice seems more mature and not quite as smooth as some of his sweet renditions (Here in My Heart, Speak Softly Love). He has included his ""signature"" song Spanish Eyes. The CD is worth purchasing if only for two selections ""I Have a Dream"" and ""Sweet Angel of Mine"". With them he is the Al Martino we expect."
3,"""COME SHARE THE WINE""","The great Italian-American vocalist Al Martino returns with an album of new material, ""Come Share The Wine"". Originally released in Europe with the title ""The Love Of My Life"" a few years back, the disc finally received an American release only very recently. Hearing Mr. Martino sing is always a pleasurable experience and his performance here is quite good for such a veteran entertainer. Ultra-cheap production and some second-rate songwriting hinder the quality but even most of the sub-par songs are catchy and Al makes them fun to listen to. It's nice to have a new Al Martino album out, but now it's time for the retro labels to start releasing his old studio albums onto compact disc!"
4,HOT,"Great hot candy. Always loved these.Be carful, paid almost the same to ship them as i did for the candy."
4,Great value for money,"Great value and my niece loved it.The only disappointment was that mine arrived open and spilling out into the box. It was for Christmas, and I had no time for returns, so I just pulled off the plastic inner wrapper and snapped the top back on. Thank goodness the plastic bin was not damaged."
5,Ferrara Pan Atomic Fire Balls,If I could keep a supply of these I would. I love them. If you like hot things then this is the candy for you. If your afraid it might hurt your teeth or you might get choked you can lay a towel over them and crush them with a hammer. They are just as good. :) I need to save up so I can get some more.
1,Fireballs,"The Container came all dented up, this is a gift, looks really bad, came in a box way to big."
3,Not as advertised,"When I ordered these, the container looked different on the photo, and the item weight was 4.4 lbs. When they arrived, the container looks like it currently does (a cheaper looking plastic) and the item weight is 4 lbs. I would not have ordered them if I had known they were the 4 lb standard container you can get at Sam's for <$10. Just a thought."
4,Product was good...,"The product was just like it was described. However, I found the same product for a lot less at Sam's Club."
5,Highly addictive!,"There are two sizes of Atomic fireballs, large and small. I personally prefer the smaller ones as I like to crunch them.I also found these to be very helpful when I was undergoing treatment for breast cancer. I would have an awful metal taste in my mouth from the chemotherapy and these helped to chase metal mouth away long enough for me to eat something I liked.I still put them in my pockets for when I go for infusion therapy. It helps to have something to occupy your time."
3,Not as I remember them...,"These are not the Atomic Fireballs I remember. It had been several years since I had seen them. I purchased these as a gift after searching locally with no luck. The day before my order arrived I saw some in a corner store. These were smaller than the Fireballs I remember of the early 90's. The Fireballs I ordered were of this smaller variety. They may have been this size for ten years or more. Since the purchase was a gift I can't comment of flavoring. The old Fireballs were the size of a big jaw breaker, these ""new"" ones are a hair bigger than a nickel gumball."
3,Okay product,"I had not eaten fire balls since I was a young child. I'm now 65. My expectations were probably set too high. The product arrived on time - the taste just wasn't as good as I thought I remembered. Don't get me wrong, they are okay and I eat about 3 a day but won't be ordering anymore after these are gone. My major disappointment was the shipping charges which were about the same cost as the product."
5,Fireballs for a long time,I purchased this huge Atomic Fireball Jar because I'm hooked on Fireballs...they're big red cinnamon hot jaw breakers and I suck on them while I game. Lovely.
2,Not very comfortable!,"I tried these ""medical"" support pantyhose in my search for the perfect pair of support hose to help the venous return problem in one of my legs. I found them to be expensive and a little on the short side. I found them to fit poorly too. After wearing them for about 2 hours, they started to bag around my ankles and knees. I had to go to the restroom and pull them up every two hours try to reduce the bagging. They also didn't hold up better than the Futuro pantyhose I bought and I couldn't tell the difference between the Futuro pantyhose and the Jobst pantyhose when I took them out of the package!!They are fairly sheer, have a slight sheen, more like regular support pantyhose, if you are looking for a pair of pantyhose that offer sheerness without looking like medical grade support hose."
3,you must buy one size bigger.,"I get large but it must be one bigger, so if you are medium get large.I receive on time. Thanks."
2,I have not received the pantyhoses. They were the wrong color and I returned them. I am waiting for the new package.,I am waiting for the pantyhoses. They sent the wrong color.I returned them.Elena
3,Bluesy,"Bluesy, but a bit one-dimensional for my tastes. Her commitment to her craft is evident, but her performances do not ""ring my bell"" the way I had hoped."
5,Utopians of history,"After reading this book, the reader will have a solid base to make judgement upon those who believe THEY (the Utopians) are better suited (intelligence, benevolence) to take control of everybody else's lives (the DAILY living decisions). The ""everybody else"" are those who don't fit into their ruling crowd. The names of these modern utopians are names like Hitler, Stalin, Lenin, Roosevelt, Mao, the Kennedys, the Clintons, and now Obama. Although Obama didn't (or will) kill millions of people, his mentality is of the same structure of ""I know best for all"" and will use government power to enforce HIS, like the other names mentioned, well intentioned will. Without the mega sized government like China, Russia, WW2 Germany, and now the American government, he, like them, are nothing more than street corner preachers of good intentions."
5,BEST AND EASIEST MAP MAKER OUT THERE,I struggled with ARCMAP because is powerful but also because it so hard to use. This program is so easy and makes a profession map. I can now make a detailed map and print in under 20 minutes. The same map in ARCMAP took me 8 hours. Buy it you will not regret it.
2,Keep walking...,"...right past this movie in the video store. This is the film that convinced me that, outside of Friends, I just don't care for Jennifer Aniston. For a moment, early in the movie, I thought, ""Hey, she's actually playing a _character_ here."" But it passed, and she went back to her usual, low-rent routine. The script and story weren't bad, but a different lead actress (maybe Hope Davis) should have been the first order of business on this production."
3,An eye-opening look at how life Really works,"Real life is full of twists and turns, as is reflected in this movie. Very few things turn out just the way you think they should. I think the object of everyone's affection was the unborn child and then the little girl. In the end Molly made everyone grow up and get a Real life."
5,Moving and Uplifting,I was really surprised by this film. It showed unconventional relationships in a honest and refreshing way. Superb performances by the entire cast make this movie work - I highly recommend it.
5,Most realistic depiction of gay-straight relationships....,"that I have ever seen. I feel qualified to comment, as the straight woman roommate/best friend of a gay man myself. Everyone's story is unique, but this movie hits on real life feelings, situations and quirks. References to Fire Island, and such make it all the more realistic :)"
5,THE BEST,"The best film. I can't say no more. the most romantic, funny and beautifull. I don't know why I can't buy it in my country. I would like to see it every day."
4,It is one of the most intelligent romantic comedys I've seen,"The Object of My Affections fits into the romantic comedy genre, but with it's unpredictable storyline and characters which aren't the usual cliches, it provides an interesting two hours viewing. Jennifer Aniston wasn't too far away from her usual role, but Paul Rudd was excellent."
3,Not the best,"If you're looking for a romantic comedy that will make you feel all warm inside, look elsewhere. This is a very depressing movie. The story centers on a pregnant woman who falls in love with a gay man. He has agreed to help raise her baby. They almost make love and then the phone rings. He leaves her to go off with his ex-boyfriend but still, she thinks he loves her the same way she loves him. While away, he falls in love with another man. He comes home and she's jealous. ...That's understandable because he can't change who he is. It was a very bad idea they had from the start. Still, there is a connection between them and in romantic comedies the audience wants to see them together in the end. ... Disappointing."
1,"Contrived,empty and stereotypical","This is emblematic of all the empty headed s*?t that comes out of Hollywood. They completely gutted the book of all its complexities and nuances and made it ""acceptable"" to the stupid masses who regularly waste their money seeing s*?t like this. Jennifer Aniston can't act her way out of paper bag."
2,"Ultimately boring, with too much sugar.","I agree with the reviewers who said that this is too sugary too often, and is much too long. Anniston is good, the guy playing the gay character isn't as good as he should be. Towards the end of this overlong soap opera, I didn't care what happened to anybody in it."
2,Repetitious servings of fairy floss & syrup.Sickly.,"I enjoyed ""Sleepless"" so I can be a romantic but the story of a tiresome female who knows so little about ""gays"" that she thinks she can swing him into ""hetro mode"" by using one pathetic ploy after another, must be a story for ""Spice Girls"" aged fans at the very best. Talk about wanting your money back."
2,What a disappointment,"Wow, I was so crushed at the end of this film. I ADORE the novel, by Stephen Mccauley and thought that Wendy Wasserstein would do his work justice. All that remains are that the characters are still named George and Nina and Nina is pregnant and wants George to help her raise the baby. Gone is Doran, the bane of George's existance at nursery school, and Paul isn't from Vermont, and his fiesty mother is gone also. In her place is Nigle Hawthorne, doing his damned best with a pointless character. Also, the wonderful Alison Janney is in here in a role that was also NOT in the book. Let's not even start about how they took poor downtrodden Howard and made him and obnoixious odious little man.Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd are perfectly cast and do their best to make something out of basically nothing. Shame on Ms. Wasserstein for her butchery to Mr. MCCauleys novel."
2,"2 stars for Aniston, ZERO for movie","In less than ten words: Straight girl falls in love with gay male roommate. Jennifer Aniston gives an emotional performance - she does a splendid job of making you really feel for her character Nina, who works with teens in a community center. This movie also features Alan Alda in a supporting role. Does Alan Alda ever shut up?!? Jeez! Furthermore, Paul Rudd's performance (as George the gay roommate) didn't have even a fraction as much emotion as Aniston's performance. The movie could've been MUCH shorter and it had a tad bit too much sugar and Alda is downright annoying."
2,Unusual,"Unfortunately this film wasn't what I was expecting. Although Aniston and Rudd work well together and their friendship is touching, if you like a perfect happy ending to your film then don't watch this.Although the character portrayals were great the actual story left me feeling a little flat."
1,Technical flaws,"My copy of the title was full of technical flaws. Amazon was very prompt to refund it, but a replacement was not available as the title was out of print. I am waiting for a re-release of it so I can then purchase one."
5,More plausible than you think,"Though serpentine in its plot development, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and --for anyone who has ever been impossibly in love-- totally believable film. Aniston and Rudd plunge into uncharted territory with their ""nonsexual agreement,"" proving affection is a very deep and complex emotion which doesn't much care whether one is gay , straight, bi or whatever."
5,A GREAT Movie!!!!!,"""The Object of my Affection,"" Starring Aniston and Rudd, is never slow! Always wonderful,""The Object of my Affection,"" is a superb, romantic comedy. 5 STARS!!!!!!!"
3,Sweet & Touching,Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston are wonderful together. They are so tender and real. I especially enjoyed their final dancing scene (at the wedding) --- it was lovely. My only complaint about this movie is that the dialogue was cheapened on so many occasions by unnecessary profanity. Gifted screen writers are able to create dialogue that is rich enough and compelling enough to grab viewers' attention without resorting to words that have no value.
2,"jennifer is great, movie is poor","I thought the movie story line,was boring, contrite, and went no where.I believe jennifer aniston carried the movie.Her acting was great, and her comedic approach is always terrific.Why she gets bogged down in poorly written,close to idiotic story lines is quite amazing.her talents are wasted in a movie like this; whose talents are continuously wasted in poor and meaningless stories and pictures.Again jennifer is the best.She should find better roles to play in. jack purvin,m.d."
1,Simply unwatchable,"This could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen. Instead of sitting through two hours of pure agony, pull out your toenails with pliers. This will equal the pain felt while watching the movie and take much less time."
5,Absolutely Hilarious!,One of the funniest books I've read. In fact I'm reading it for a second time and I wanted to do so on my e-reader.
3,They did well given what they were working with,"The characters in this movie are people that you can actually imagine meeting: Real, working class people trying to make it through life subject to many constraints.The acing was good throughout and with all characters.One big problem was imagining that a psychiatrist could be coopted for a very small amount of insurance money ($50,000) to try to violate his ethics and prompt a patient to kill himself. The whole movie was not premised on this, and so the whole plot did not shatter when we found out that the psychiatrist was the ""other person."" It did, however, severely weaken the believability of the whole movie."
5,"A THRILLING READ FOR THE MIND, HEART AND SOUL",Mark A. Rockeymoore writes with the fine-line precision of a scientist and the visionary eloquence of an angel. Few authors dare to even imagine the depth and scope of a book such as TEMPLE OF THE SKY much less attempt to actually write it. Readers are treated in these amazing pages both to the wonders of life as we sometimes know it and to the possibilities of the universe as we sometimes dream it may be. This grandly entertaining and wholly captivating novel is well on its way to becoming a modern classic just as Mark A. Rockeymoore is well on his way to becoming one of the most important voices in early twenty-first century literature.Aberjhaniauthor ofThe Wisdom Of W.E.B. Du Bois (Wisdom Library)AndEncyclopedia of the Harlem Renaissance (Facts on File Library of American History)
1,BEWARE !!! MUSIC ON THIS CD IS THE FLO'S,"THE COVER OF THIS CD HAS MARY WILSON,CINDY BIRDSONG AND JEAN TERRELL AND THE INSIDE COVER HAS DIANA ROSS,MARY WILSON AND FLORENCE BALLARD,NONE OF THESE LADIES ARE SINGING ON THIS CD!!!!!!!!! IT'S SCHERRI PAYNE AND LYNDA LAURENCE AND SOME OTHER PHONEY!!!!! MY FRIEND BOUGHT ME THIS CD AS A PRESENT,IT'S VERY MISLEADING AND A DISGRACE TO THESE LADIES PICTURED ON THE COVER. SCHERRI PAYNE AND LYNDA LAURENCE WERE SUPREMES BUT THERE MUSIC IS NOT SUPREME! THEY NEED TO PUT THEIR OWN PICTURE ON THE COVER AND QUIT TRYING TO RIP PEOPLE OFF!"
3,Truth more fascinating than fiction!,"This is a short read, but so interesting! Baby Doe Tabor's life story is something right out of a soap opera. What an incredible life she had. I sat down and read it at one sitting - each page has so many fascinating historical and dramatic elements. I agree with the previous reviewer - this would make for a fantastic movie (there was an earlier rather fictionalized one mentioned in this book). Drama, romance, passion, revenge, murder...it's all here and all true!"
2,Great device - cheap construction,"Hi The Marshmallow Roadsting Forks make the best mashhmallows, but they are poorly constructed. One of mine broke during cleaning after a couple of uses."
3,Problems with Act II,"The other reviewers have provided good synopses of this book. I had the curse of reading the first half in Analog, where it went by the title ""The Wonderful Secret."" The serial version ended with Dammy stealing the space vehicle to head out to the stars. Years later, when I finally read the entire book, I was disappointed that the second half really did not go anywhere, and I also found the stream-of-consciousness narration difficult to follow. Overall, an interesting book, with a humanistic premise that we're all capable of being the best in the Galaxy (or at least ""Class 2, Special"") and capable of kicking anyone's tail feathers who messes with us."
4,Superman doesn't stand a chance..,"This book is an easy read and slightly entertaining. Summary: A man is kidnaped by an alien and trained mentaly and phsycially to become superhuman. Some of his talents include matter transmission, matter conversion, levation and telepathy. These are just a few of his talents and once gained he must use them to solve a mystery for all mankind."
3,It arrived on time but broken,"I order the clock, and had great expectations, but unfortunately it arrived damaged, and so I had to send it back for a refund."
3,Good but not great,"This clock is easy to read, but the green night light could be improved. The light cannot be put on constantly (only settings are Off and Sensor), and the light sensor means it only comes on in complete darkness. In low light, the sensor doesn't think it is dark enough. The clock requires 1 AA battery, while the night light requires 3 AA batteries. I couldn't find anything better than this though."
3,bate&switch,product shown as ordered was not product received. Producted shipped had roman numerals and I was given a discount off the price due to inability on my part to return item timely. Clock good but preference was item as shown.
4,Happy the second time around,"On our first try the hands were not adjusted properly so whenever we hung the clock on the wall they would get stuck at 2:00. The return process was easy and our second one works well. The Roman numerals IV-VIII are upside down, but that doesn't really matter. The clock is 13 feet away from our bed, and we can see it at night fine."
3,Disappointing,"I was somewaht disappointed in that the backlighting on the clock face was incomplete and uneven, emminating from a single led, without good diffusion over the entire face as expected. Otherwise works fine as a normal wall clock."
1,Junk,"If this isn't a second, it ought to be. Item package claims it has a glass lens. Nope, it's plastic. Clock arrived with scratched lens - inside the packing. Perhaps this was a repackaged return? Based on the other reviews I concur: don't buy this clock. I returned for a refund but shipping both ways cost me as much as the clock - and I have nothing to show for it."
2,hard to see,The clock is beautiful! But in night glow mode it is almost impossible to read from across the room. So if you want it for close up it would be fine.
3,"Good clock, glows in dark",It's a little bigger than it looks in the picture. Does glow in the dark (just the face). Keeps good time.
1,This Clock does Not Match Photograph.,The frame is silverish paint over black pastic.The Dial is much more modern with sanserif numbers.It posesses a conventional movement with the second hand concentric to the others.The backlight is insufficient to read past 10 feet at night by my eyes.The backlighting is a timer set for up to eight hours starting when you first adjust it. The light does not come on with reduced light levels.Mine both arrived with a hazing of the crystal. [Shop wear?]David Bullis
2,Not the greatest quality,"It says it has a glass face. It looks and feels like plastic. The face was scuffed when I got it, as there was no protective film on it. Also, the face is what is 12.5 inches. Add in the frame and it is a lot bigger. The arms are not solid; so that along with the fact that the numbers are not part of the back lit area make it harder to read at night."
3,poorly designed hands,"This clock makes a great night light if you want a night light. The design of the hands make reading the clock in the dark difficult. As I bought the clock so that I could read the time in the dark, the poorly designed hand defeats that purpose."
3,bernzomatic,"well first off its not made by irwin tools, it has bernzomatic stamped all over it. that being said it produces a very hot flame especially when used with mapp gas. the only thing to keep in mind is that the tip itself gets very hot also, in comparison to more high end torches."
1,Only lasted a couple of years,Useful item while it was working. After about two years the valve started leaking gas. Very disappointing. I wouldn't buy another. I noticed that they don't make these any more. I suspect it's a quality issue.
3,Not powerful enough for video,"I installed this card in my HP Pavilion Slimline, expecting it to outperform the onboard video. Instead, the performance was worse, ranking only a ""2.0"" Windows rating. Also, the bracket for half-height cases is not included."
4,No wrong in seller's part.,"Please be careful to make sure your computer supports this product. I bought it, and when I went to install it, I found that it won't work with my computer. My computer is a little too old."
1,Disappointing book...,"Since I lived in Taif & Riyadh (Saudi Arabia) for 20 years, I believe I have a good grasp of the life in that country. I bought this book even though friends who lived in Saudi Arabia had warned me that I would be disappointed--that the writing was stilted, but most importantly, the author had missed too many important points about Saudi life. Actually, Ms. Mackey's distant observations made me feel she was out of touch with the real Saudi Arabia and with real Saudi Arabians.Once I realized that this book was written many years ago, and that the author had very obviously spent very few years inside the Kingdom and then has not been back for nearly twenty years, I was quite dismayed.As someone who spent many years as a guest inside the desert Kingdom, there are books on Saudi Arabia that I would recommend, including Robert Lacey's ""The Kingdom"" and Jean Sasson's ""Princess,"" but I would not recommend this particular book."
2,A slow read....,"While this book is quite informative and details interesting insights into the Saudis, I found it to be a slow read. The writing is very bland. I only continued to finish the book because I find the subject matter interesting, but it took a long time to finish, as my attention span wained. I chose to read this book after reading PRINCESS: A TRUE STORY OF LIFE BEHIND THE VEIL IN SAUDI ARABIA, by Jean Sasson. This book peaked my interest in Saudi Arabia. I was dissapointed to find that THE SAUDIS didn't provide the intense insight into the Saudi culture like Sassons's book does."
4,Liked it,"Enjoyed it very much. Easy to read and interesting. Don't know what she got right or wrong with the facts, but it's a good story."
2,Better than book on Iraq,"I had read this one before I read the author's book on Iraq and it is the best of the two, but still I felt the author was giving out second hand information. She lived so briefly in the kingdom and did not even live in a native setting, so I do not believe she is a person who needs to be writing about the Saudis. She is assuming to be an expert when in reality, that is rather a joke. I think of this book as giving me a chance to be an outsider peeking in, for about five minutes. There are plenty of good books out there on the Middle East, but unfortunately, none are written by this author. She should find a new career."
4,Good DVD player,"We've had this DVD player since 2004, and I only upgraded because I wanted an upconverting player with HDMI.I used this with my 32"" HDTV; the progressive scan and component video looked great. It is just a standard definition player though.The only downside is that when you lose the remote, setting it up correctly with a Universal is a pain: six or seven codes work, but not all of the codes have all of the features!"
1,"Bad Value--Defective DVD Player, Awful Warranty and Support","This DVD player played movies fine until it stopped recognizing any DVD after only 7 months. Magnavox said to buy a DVD lens cleaner ($15) which didn't work, then said that their warranty was only for 90 days so offered a 'discounted' replacement at the exact price I bought it for. For their defective product they wanted me to pay more in support than the original purchase after only 7 months. No thanks, I'll avoid Magnavox in the future."
3,"Confusing, somewhat entertaining","I rented this from Amazon Instant Video. It seemed low-budget, and the beginning of the movie held some promise, then it just got increasingly confusing. I won't spoil any of it for anyone who wants to watch it but I was slightly disappointed in the plot. I give 3 stars because of some of the unexpected twists and turns, but it wasn't enough to make me happy I rented it. The editing could have been done better, too, as that added to my confusion."
2,Not that great,We went and saw this movie at a special showing at the theatre and i have to say it was not that great. i feel it was way to predictable. for a low budhet movie it was not horrible could have spent a little more time on it.
3,Kirkwoods are good actors but the movie lacked the proper violence and nudity.,Not the best producing of a motion picture movie film. I prefer horror films with creative murders and significantly more nudity.
3,"Could've, Should've Been Much Better","This 40 minute CD is a single track with various witch cackles, laughs, owls, clock tickings and heartbeats. The sounds are original and not ripped from other sources, and they are good.The sound mixing is also well done. But what you get is the same 5 minutes looped over and over and over again. If this CD makes you feel like you're walking in a dark forest alone, you must bewalking in circles. Make that *small circles*. Given the price of about ..., you'd expect a lot more.Another problem with the CD is that some sections have thumping heartbeats for 30 seconds (not in ... sound sample). If you play this on a boombox it will sound awful. Don't buy this CD unless you plan to put it on a full home stereo with big woofers.Since trick-or-treaters will only be passing by for a moment ortwo, this CD is adequate for most home Halloween needs. But giventhe stiff price and what else exists out there, it is not a goodvalue."
2,Big Let-Down,"First, let me say that I'm a big fan of both Martha's halloween ideas and Rhino Records (the label that released this CD). I was Very eager to hear what both of these talents combined could come up with. Sadly, both Martha & Rhino (names I Trusted) let me down. My two main complaints? 1. It's just a 5 minute loop!and 2. as another reviewer pointed out, this CD doesn't tell a story and take you from one scene to the next (because it's ONLY ONE SCENE- over & over). The reason I'm writing this review is in hopes that Martha with try again with a Vol.2. Martha, if you're out there: 60 minutes of many individual themes seemlessly segued (no looping!)"
1,Very dissapointed,"After reading her excellent Halloween book, I figured her Halloween CD would be worth owning. I always search for ""different"" Halloween CDs, but this was filled with the same old stuff.Chains, moans, and spooky laughs... then more chains, moans and spooky laughs. Very dissapointing."
2,Martha Stewart Spookey Scarey music,"Not scarey at all, lots of quietness and not quite sure if the noises have stopped at all. Was disappointed with it as it was hyped up quite a bit. Might just put it on very loud at the back of the house just because Ive bought it ."
3,Good enough for the goblins,"I'm an avid collector of Hallowe'en sound-effect/music CDs, and while this one has its flaws, it's one of my favorites to play during my family's annual Hallowe'en bonfire/cook-out. The sounds, while a bit repetitive, are high-quality and just creepy enough without being too unsettling for our more sensitive guests. Good background for reading ghost stories!"
4,Pretty good,"It is one track and somewhat repetitive, but it's perfect for background music while handing out candy.Wind, owls, witch/monster voices...not bad. Understated. If you'd rather not have sci-fi/alien sounds in the background of your gothic-themed home, this is perfect. Production value is high and it's less than $10."
1,Just like Martha,"What a ""RIP OFF"". Like some other reviews said ""just a 5 minute loop over and over. The positive articles must have been written by Martha's friends. It's just like Martha to find a way to make a fast buck at other people's expense."
2,Nothing new,"I did not have very high expectations for this CD when I purchased it and was, unfortunately, not surprised. Although the quality of the sound effects are good, this CD is simply nothing we haven't heard before. After hearing music of Midnight Syndicate CDs and using those at my annual Halloween party my standards have changed. Simple sound effects CDs like this seem almost too cliche to work on their own anymore."
2,this should be titled sounds for weenie halloween.,I think Martha should sing some sort of rap back up by a hard rock band. that'd be freakin weird. someone should remix this to a techno beat and use it at a rave!! WOO HOO!!! word to nickd
3,"Looked cool, but not much fun.","I bought this for my 8 year old son. There is nothing wrong with it, but he only played with it once for about an hour. My youngest son liked it, but only in the bathtub. It looks cool and is well built, but for some reason once the kids got it they didn't want to play with it."
5,Love These Vitamins,"As a vegetarian I really need a vitamin with iron and also want good, solid dosages of vitamin C and other essentials. It's so refreshing to find a daily vitamin that not only has all the basics but that also includes whole food supplements -- and for a decent price. Many other comparable vitamins are either overpriced or skimp on valued ingredients. The instant I came across this brand I felt that I found what I needed, and after taking them for two months I haven't been disappointed."
3,Hard to Find Supplement Facts,"Before I bought this product, I was looking around on Google to find the Supplement Facts.On their website:[...] I wasn't able to find this particular product.Their search bar is useless too.Then, I got to here: [...]Looks exactly the same like this product on the page so that's why I bought it.When I received it, I was pretty surprised that the supplement facts are different, especially in the B-12, like wayyy different.I uploaded 2 images for others to see the actual Supplement Facts.After I bought it though, I finally found it: [...]But again, it doesn't have the same title...Just took the vitamin for the first time today and we'll see how it goes."
2,Old product,"I've bought and used this product locally at thehealth food store for years. This time I purchasedthe larger size to save money from Amazon.The product from the health food store was sealedand the tablets were fresh with a hard shell andslight vitamin smell.The product from Amazon was also sealed, but thetablets were softer and had a heavy vitamin smell.This condition results from having the tabletsexposed to the air for at least a months time.This tells me that the tablets sat out at thefactory and aged, then packaged and shipped.Its a shame! I'll go back to buying locally inthe smaller quantity again, or start looking fora similar product. So it goes with products intodays world. No integrity!"
5,Great purchase...,"I was looking for a whole food type vitamin but everything on the shelves in my town was terribly expensive, you didn't get but a month's supply, not enough vegetables incorporated, etc. etc. This was a GOOD buy overall, was shipped out immediately, completes my daily needs."
2,"verdict on quality still out, but.....","I have just started taking this supplement, so I do not have a change in energy or anything else related to report.....yet. I do, however, have a very difficult time swallowing these because they are absolutely huge. I tried cutting them with the pill cutter but the edges were so sharp it hurt when I swallowed them. It's not possible to cut them and round off edges since they easily crumble. Trying to blend them into a drink is not an option due to the very strong taste."
5,study guide,Great study guide about the Kingdom and how God wants us to set up His Kingdom here on earth. God is our King and we are to rule under Him. This 40 day devotional will encourage and enlighten your life.
4,Great Read,Kingdom Principles: Preparing for Kingdom Experience and Expansion (Understanding the Kingdom)Dr. Munroe does a magnificent job providing greater details about kingdom concepts. A wonderful investment for those seeking a greater understanding of God's kingdom.
3,"Okay, like videos better","After viewing his videos on this subject, this book seemed a bit awkward in its presentation. Too much time and too many words were spent explaining ideas rather than getting to the point with the excellent examples that Dr. Munroe used in his videos. I never finished reading it as a result."
4,Great Purchase!,"The book was in excellent condition, I have no complaints at all, it was everything I expected."
1,big disappointment,Was looking forward to this based on his reputation and the subject. Had to force myself to finish it -- kind of pointless.
1,Just Say No To Rob Thomas,"This song is well-produced, catchy, and well-performed. But why is it so bad? Maybe because Rob went from the soul-less pop-rock schlock of Matchbox 20 to his new image as a shorn, ear-ringed, and hoodied poser. Unfortunately, even if you liked Matchbox 20 (I pity you), you probably won't like this.He sings music that he doesn't have the earnestness nor the authenticity to pull off; and maybe they should have had Usher do it, since he is actually talented.What does Rob want to be, a mere pop star and make a ton of money? Ok he is that and has done that. Does he want to make a musical statement that will endure and prevent him from being relegated to the annals of 'Whatever happened to this guy?' Probably not."
2,Let Me Qualify That,"The music on this CD was not bad, in fact, some of it was quite good - however, I was extremely disapointed to find out that this was the solo effort of one, Rob Thomas - NOT Rob Lowe, which is why I purchased the CD."
3,Well you could judge it by the amount being sold used....,"or you might be smart enough to realize no matter how good or bad a cd is, there are still going to be many used/new for sale. why? because people burn them and then resell them dumby. not cause they thought it was bad. and if you knew this you could judge it by what you thought when you listened to it instead. and i personally thought it wasn't the rob thomas from matchbox twenty. very different direction. that single they are playing to death on the radio sounds like a ricky martin song. i'd say that ""all that i am"" is about the only good one. but then i basically expected a more matchbox twenty sound so i guess i set my self up to not like it. but i still gave it 3 stars cause i like rob thomas no matter what."
2,Rob Rob Rob....,"Rob Thomas I am Very Dissapointed in you I Expected So much From your solo debut esp with your single lonley no more..people Rob Thomas is app trying Something new here so and its obvious its pretty bad most of his songs are just a bunch of blah blah blah really boring and bad songs with horrible beats and poor Ballad's this cd is not worth the price i paid for it in fact its so bad i woulden't even give it away..the only upside is lonley no more,when the heartache ends and ever the same but other then that its just Junk and the slow songs are just so boring and hard to listen to because they just suck Sorry Rob But maybe you should stick to what you were doing before...good try though dont buy this unless you really i mean really love rob thomas a big dissapointment you can do better rob."
3,"Ok album, prefer Matchbox20","Heard samples of all the songs on this album, decided not to purchase it. Rob is great as the lead singer of Matchbox20. Songs like Bright Lights, Unwell, Push, are simply amazing, without the rest of the band, this album is really OK, Rob's voice is still there, but the production of the songs are not as good as Matchbox. He may be better off just sticking with his band."
3,Something of a disappointment,"I love Matchbox Twenty. I will tell you also that I was a little bit, no make that a lot, disappointed with the solo performance of Rob Thomas on this, his debut solo album. All in all 5 songs are very good on this album like ""Ever the same"" ""My My My"" and ""Now comes the night"".This is certainly, by the title, aan album in which Thomas is trying to find himself. I have a news flash, he does not. He mixes all kinds of different music be it from pop, alternative sounds to instrumental chaos and cinematic music, to eastern drums and rock sounds... i mean it's a complete array of different sounds. The fact is that you cannont get a feel for the album, except on the last song where the mood of the song is refering to death or some kind of end (well it is the end of the album...).Clearly, I expected more... he could have used those Matchbox Twenty style arrangements... at least he was original at one point, using a xylophone to start of a song!"
3,Great CD - if you can play it!,"This is my fist CD that I have bought in the DualDisc format and it will be my last. I bought the CD as I am a fan of MatchBox 20 and have been totally frustrated that it will not play! Not in my car's CD player, it won't play in my home stereo or on my computer's DVD/CD rom drive! I wasn't suprised in that my car stereo is not that new but I thought for sure it would play on my computer. I have only manged to listen to the CD once since I bought it. I feel as thought I've wasted my money on something that doesn't work!"
5,Simply The BEST,"As a huge MB20 fan, I anxiously awaited Rob's solo release, and I have been completely blown away. I love the mix of styles in this music, and honestly, can't find even one song that I DON'T just love.My favorite is ""Falling to Pieces"". Such a unique song with a rock-blues feel. But, there are so many others that I love as well. In fact, I love this entire CD.Rob NEVER disappoints...this CD is the best I've heard in a VERY long time."
4,"""Single At Last""",I thought when I bought this CD that Lonely No More was the only good song Thomas had to offer. Boy was I wrong. This Is How A Heart Breaks is a great song. I only found one boring song on the album. I f you like soft rock or just like Rob Thomas then this is a must buy.
5,Something to Be,"I was introduced to Matchbox 20 at 50 with a live concert! My kids (20 somethings) thought Matchbox 20 was old news! I am a hard core music lover and they were unbelievable in Concert and I have been totally impressed by their musicality.Something to Be is excellent. There is a terrific range of cuts - everything from fast edgy to soft, hymn-like ballads. Even my wife who was cool on MB20 is raving about this CD - and the DVD is great - makes you realize the art of song writing and creation is truly a gift!You won't be disappointed if you really listen to the talent!"
3,Anti-Piracy,"I was extremely disappointed in this CD/DVD combo. The music is great, but I can hear it on the radio everyday. I want it on my ipod and on demand! However, this CD/DVD prevents users from downloading the music onto their computer without indicating such on the label. So now I'm stuck with a useless $13 shiny piece of plastic."
3,Upbeat,"I was not a big matchbox 20 fan so wasn't sure what to expect, but I tend to like Thomas more when he's solo. This is a fun CD and I like many of the songs, but it's not something I can listen to over and over again. However, it is a great album to clean house to!"
4,K.I.S.S.,"KEEP IT SIMPLE STUPID! If you like Rob Thomas, you will like this cd. If you don't like Rob Thomas, you won't like this cd.I like his music :) hence, four stars.1) this is how a heart breaks, 2) lonely no more, 8)problem girl and 12)now comes the night, really stand out on this cd.'nuff said"
1,Not Happy,"don't buy this cd if you plan to listen to it in a cd changer. It's got the ""bonus"" dvd on the same disc as the music, which makes it too fat to play in the cd changer. I spent the evening taking my cd player apart to get out the cd that I plan to return. Never got as far as listening to it so that I could write a review of the music.."
2,Disapointing,"I am a Matchbox Twenty Fan and a fan of all kinds of music in general, but this is a total step back from the potential I know Rob Thomas has. This CD could have been a hundred times better than it is... especially when you can pull in John Mayer for a track. I mean Streetcorner Symphony (The track on which Mr. Mayer plays on) is a campy and cheesey over produced song that any Mickey Mouser with time to kill could have made. The Bright spot on the album is the first single Lonely no more ( I love the dance feel of the track it came totally out of left field for me) and the song My, My, My isn't that awful."
3,A Solid Solo Debut,"Rob Thomas has taken the road recently traveled by many frontmen from pop and rock...the solo route. ""Something To Be"" is an album that does the same for Thomas as it has done for several other bandmen turned solo stars--it alienates some of the band fans and picks up a more pop audience. The lead single ""Lonely No More"" should have been the indication to Matchbox Twenty fans that Rob wasn't the same artist he was with his band. And honestly, that's what solo projects are for. Anyway, if you are a fan of the lead single and have heard ""This Is How A Heart Breaks,"" other tracks on the album may seem less produced and more heartfelt. Although he DOES happen to say ""hardcore..."", ""Something To Be"" is a solid effort with a more pop sound than you might expect from Thomas. If you're a diehard M20 fan you might not be a big fan of the CD just because of that reason. Bottom Line: the singles are the highlights for pop fans and the album cuts may satisfy M20 fans, but don't bank on it."
4,Great CD,This is a great CD.Usually when u buy a CD you have maybe 1 or 2 songs that are good.But everyne here is good.Only problem i have is u cant pay it on a regular CD player.It only works on DVD.I can pay it on my walkman but not CD stero.Weird.
4,Great CD!!!,"This is an awesome cd! If you are a big Matchbox Twenty fan, then GET THIS!! It's packed full of great songs...aside from the hit ""Lonely No More"", ""Ever the Same"" is going to be the big ""radio smash"" off this cd (it's the ""Unwell"" of this disc)...""Problem Girl"" sounds like a hit for radio, too...The only real disappointment is the opening track ""This Is How a Heart Breaks""...it's almost like a ""filler"" track and never reallt goes anywhere, imo...but overall this is a must have disc for any Matchbox Twenty fan!"
3,Too experimental for my taste,"This album was a huge departure from the work Rob Thomas had done with Matchbox Twenty. There are a lot of funky, soulful grooves on this album, which didn't work for me. It was a valiant effort, but most of the songs just didn't make much of an impact on me. ""Lonely No More"" was a great single, and inspired me to buy the album. Other than that single, there just wasn't any other song that really blew me away. A few decent songs, and the rest was filler. I look forward to Rob's next release, whether it be back with Matchbox Twenty, or another solo project."
1,Something to avoid...,"Rob Thomas is the Bryan Adams of the 21st Century. If you like bland, tasteless pop music masked to be edgy, then this is your man. He sings with horrible vowels, he can't dance (seeing his video proves that), and his songwriting is as predicable as a Bon Jovi song. If I ever find myself listening to music like his, then it is time for me to go to my eternal rest. So if you have any, and I mean any, musical taste, please don't buy this album and scoff anyone you see listening to, or even worse, enjoying this album. Get the new Feist album. That is some catchy, interesting music. And if you don't want to get that try something else. Heck, get a U2 album."
5,Something To Be! Something So Brilliant.,"Like the song, Ron Thomas is ever the same. He is an amazing song writer, and in my books, the best song writer in this world. So many people could not even come close to his talent and remarkable voice. He is a masterpiece and so is this album. ""Ever The Same"" is a brilliant song and may just be used as my wedding song in the future. All songs in fact are well thought out and made.Rob has changed the style of music in a good way so that it doesn't sound like a Matchbox album. He has given it that sort of R&B feel to it, it sounds great and Rob looks great. He fits in well with this type of music and style. His solo album is worth buying. He's still ever the same in his lyrical content. Buy this record and dont rip off a great musician that works so hard and deserves record sales.Nothing but Brilliant!!"
1,Lame Attempt At A Comeback!,"As a huge Matchbox 20 fan, this album disgusts me. I already have it posted up on ebay. Anyone want to buy it from me? I originally thought I would give this album a chance, because I also liked the song ""Smooth"" which featured a solo Rob then.Well this cd is nothing like that. Lonely No More is the only song worth listening to, and even that gets boring.PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF SOME MONEY AND DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY CD."
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"It says something LOUD and CLEAR about this CD when 2 days after the release date, Amazon.com has 29 new/used copies for sale! If you have to have this CD, wait until the price drops below $5 . . . cuz it will !"
2,Lame.,"I think there is some high quality writing on this disc and I find 3-4 of the songs to be quite listenable. However, that's the highest compliment I can muster. With the exception of ""Now Comes The Night,"" only b/c I burned it onto a compilation, I haven't listened to this cd since the month it came out. I wasn't looking for a Justin Timberlake-esque album when I picked this up. I just don't dig whatever direction Rob wanted to go in with his solo material. I find the stylistic inconsistency as a hinderance to the album rather than a selling point for his diversity. Next effort please!"
1,Don't know what it sounds like because...,it won't play in anything. I'm taking it back to the store and never buying DualDisc CD again.
4,Pop/Rock that works,"You'll want to crank this album. Rob Thomas -- a gifted, award-winning songwriter -- shows us he's more than just your average pop/rock band frontman. Generally a music buyer is lucky to get six great tracks off of one album, but Rob has delivered a dozen you'll want to listen to over and over again."
1,SELL OUT,"I think Ricky Martin tried to make a comeback in disguise as Rob Thomas... or Rob Thomas attempting to make a buck by sounding like a Justin Timberlake knockoff...Whatever...Matchbox 20 was original, they did their own stuff. This album sounds like every other over produced pop album that attempts to pass for music. Rob Thomas, who now looks like Elijah Wood and sounds like Justin Timberlake. maybe he should take a turn on Surreal Life with Flavor Flav and Jose Canseco. Talk about a mad season...he needs one! If you're looking for something that sounds exactly like everything else out there then this cd's for you, but if you're thinking this is more great Matchbox 20 type stuff then run away!"
1,Save your money.,"Embarrassing. Embarrassing especially for his MB20 band members. Complete and worthless cookie cutter music. Let's assume his manager and record company were holding his family or pet hostage until he produced this mindless piece of crap to fill their wallets. Hey Justin, Enrique!!! Watch out, here comes Rob!!!!"
1,What was Rob thinking?,"Although one reviewer praised this album as a breakout for Rob Thomas, I would strongly disagree. To have a breakout album, an artist needs to move into other music genres in an effective way. Rob Thomas has sampled other styles by doing a poor imitation of other pop artists. It is Mad Season meets Living in Vida Loca. Rob must have thought we were loco to buy this stuff. Rob Thomas had an engaging sound and style on Matchbox 20 albums. Some over zealous producer must have gotten a hold of him. The result is that Thomas has sunk to new lows in his career. I next expect to see him on American Idol singing old Bee Gee tunes. Save your money. This one is truly a disappointment."
1,Sound quality bad and Dual Disk format CD won't play,"Although the sound quality of this CD isn't as bad as the Matchbox 20 CDs, it's still not great. I should have expected as much given the terrible quality of the Matchbox 20 CDs. Anyone with a halfway decent stereo and a good ear will be displeased with the quality of this recording, and the fact that even a LOUD volume can't drown out the obnoxious clicking of the CD as it spins in my high-end CD player doesn't help matters any. I would recommend that anyone who wants the music and has an mp3 player should buy the music from iTunes, since the sound quality won't be any better on a CD, and you'll be guaranteed to be able to listen to it. I wouldn't waste the money on the chance that your CD player will play it. I just wasted $20 on a CD that I'll never be able to listen to."
4,A good exploration of sound and style,"This is an interesting debut album that explores other styles of music that he normally doesn't touch when fronting MB20. He has a remarkable voice and is a dynamic singer. Highlights include ""Lonely No More,"" ""This is how a heart breaks,"" and for my money, the best song on the disc ...""Streetcorner Synphony."""
4,Good Job Rob!,"For a first solo attempt I think Rob did very well. I really like this CD. It's not MB20 although a tune or two has a little MB20 sound going on in it. However, for the most part it's not MB20, it's Rob Thomas. The album has some Latin/Soul flavor mixed with R&B and Rock. There are moments when I longed to hear the rest of the band with him, but I got over it. If you're a Rob Thomas fan I don't think you'll be disappointed by this album at all. That VOICE! He rocks."
4,rock on Rob!,"Can't help it; just love this guy's voice whether he is solo or with Matchbox 20. I have to admit when I first heard ""Lonely No More"" I thought hmmmmm, kinda cheesy. Then it grew on me although it is one of the weakest cuts on the disc. You can't top ""This is How a Heart Breaks"" for sheer driving energy; there's a reason it was used in the NBA playoff promos! ""I am an Illusion"" is another winner."
5,Luv it!!,This is one of his best!!!!! I truly enjoy Rob's music. His new CD is also great to listen to.
1,Whole CD is GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!!,"Rob touches on so much with this CD. My favorite song is one that hasn't got any airplay and, in my opinion, the public missed out a great hit! ""Streetcorner Symphony"" is about people coming together. It's what I call my happy song. Each day as I go to work I play the song as loud as I can get it! We, my daughters and I, saw him live and he also called it a happy song! I can't wait for his live albulm to come out! There are fast and slow songs on this CD and will be worth EVERY PENNY you spend to buy it! Incredible voice and songwritting!"
3,Paid too much,The price that was displayed after the purchase was different from the purchase price on display. I could have gone anywhere and just bought it. I do like the CD though.
3,a mediocre solo effort,"With a revamped look and experimental tunes, Rob Thomas was set for a solo career but he didn't quite do as well as he did in Matchbox Twenty. The album started out with an upbeat This Is How a Heart Breaks and that was not too bad, before kicking into the breakthrough single, Lonely No More, that made Thomas another version of Ricky Martin with an even tighter butt. Other standout tracks are Streetcorner Symphony, Something To Be and Here Comes The Night. Ballads like Fallin' To Pieces didn't quite do as well. The - points of the album outweigh the + points of the album. Recommended to hardcore M20 fans. Otherwise, forget about it."
2,I don't want to listen to this CD anymore,"I tried to get into this CD.I even talked myself into thinking this was good music.There are a couple of songs that come close,but most of the tracks are like Nails on a chalk board.This guy is such a wimp singing about being lonely,afraid,never being satisfied,and neither was I with ""Something to be."""
1,"Love the music, hate the dualdisc format","I love the CD, it's great! And I'd give it 5 stars if I could actually play the thing. It will not play in my 6 month old HP desktop or my even newer Dell laptop. It won't play in my discman and it works sporadically in my stereo. And the RIAA wonders why CD sales are dropping?!"
4,Pretty Darn Good - Even if its not Rob Lowe,"This is the best album NOT recorded by Rob Lowe, bar none!"
4,Great Debut Album - Rob Thomas - Something to Be,"I really love this album. It isn't perfect, but it's still great as a debut album. Rob Thomas offers great alternative music, with my favorite song on the album being ""Lonely No More."" The song is great because you can relate to the words of the song, and the song has a great beat to which you can dance to. He's probably more known for the song ""This is how a heart breaks,"" which was featured on the NBA on ABC theme song a year ago. That song is also fantastic, and also a song you'll love to dance to. After listening to this first album, I'm hoping that he releases a second album soon. This is a sensational album that I highly recommend."
2,Shouldn't the music be a priority?,"While the music on the CD is not as bad as some reviewers have indicated, there are but 2 or 3 tracks that stay with you after hearing them. However, the main reason for the low rating is the inability to listen to the CD on most of my players. Due to the dual-disc format, it won't play in either of our cars, one of my home players, or even our computers (to burn a copy that we can listen to on the road). I have only 1 player able to play the CD. This format is complete garbage; how many people buy a CD to watch the videos or making of documentary? If the CD plays ok, then fine, throw the extras on there. But don't screw up the format and prevent listening with useless crap. This format is the worst idea since a Starship Troopers sequel, and I will NEVER buy a dual-disc album again."
3,Wheres The Energy Rob?..,"This album started off promising. This is how a Heartbreaks explodes early. I thought it had real potential after that,but then all the energy seemed to go away. The life was totally sucked out. Just a bunch of dreary ballads. Rob has the voice for that,no doubt,but it becomes boring after a while. I'm not going to sit here and say that he should go back to MB20,because he doesn't have too. This album just lacks anything to get the listener real excited about. For hi next solo try,Rob needs too ge the energy up..Some guitar Riffs..some jamming stuff..because this got old on me real quick. Still,ok for a first solo try,but could of been something great,had the pace quickened up a bit in some of the tracks."
3,"Love Rob, his voice, his lyrics..disapointed in this CD","I really love Matchbox 20, they were pop and mainstream, yet had a very cool and unique sound. At least they were a band and rocked to some extent. Robs new album is a disapointment, it is totally geared toward younger listeners, and in my opinion deviating from the fans they attracted while in Matchbox. I honestly do not hear a band behind in him in many of these songs. I agree with one of the earlier reviewers that Rob was not the only talent in M20.I still love ya ROB! Bring back M20!"
1,Horrible,Woooh what is this. Damn Rob how low can you go. Embarrasing. I hope you stick to MB20 in the future...
4,"Yes, it can be ripped","I don't know what's up with that one reviewer but, yes, this CD can be ripped on to a computer. As for the music, I love Matchbox Twenty. This CD didn't knock me off my feet, but I appreciate Rob Thomas spanning his wings."
1,Why Did This Have To Happen!!!,"I am sorry to say this to all you radio pop listioning teenie boppers but this is TRASH! I mean just look at the video he's trying to dance and look all suave or somthing (very tacky/cheesy). What happened to the Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20 what happend to the good old days of the ""Bent"" video that was real music and it wasn't pop produced garbage. Please don't buy this and support the industry (it must DIE!)."
2,3 stars if availble as non-dualdisc,"Apparently the new fad of the RIAA this week is DualDisc-only releases, such as Springsteen's Devil's and Dust and Rob Thomas's Something To Be. I personally have enjoyed releases that have included an extra DVD with some lil featurs or videos, maybe surround mixes of tracks or the entire album.But the Dual Disc is a double-sided disc with a DVD on one side and the CD on the other, which eliminates the label and also the DVD-side ends up really scratched if you use cd-wallets or booklets in your car or anywhere, as I personally do.Overall the album itself is decent, though not as solid an effort as Matchbox Twenty, though it has it's moments when he's not just sounding like a former boy-band member."
2,a NOT must-have album,"I am a huge fan of Matchbox 20, but this solo album cannot be compared to it. It is not bad, but Rob Thomas seems to have some eastern influence on his music, especially on track 3 and 7. The melody on track 3 is similar to many eastern music melody. On track 7, one of the instruments used in the background is very ""easternly"". It is so not ""Matchbox 20"". The most catchy song is ""lonely no more"". The other songs are just okay. Even if you are a fan of Matchbox 20, this is a NOT must-have album."
4,Better with Age,"On first listen, I wasn't so jazzed about the CD, with the exception of ""Lonely No More"" and ""Ever The Same"", which were familiar from listening to the radio. The more I listened, however, the better the CD got. Some music that I listen to seems to get ""better with age"" or to improve over time; this was no exception. I plan to make the new Rob Thomas CD one of my favorites and I am actually really glad that I purchased it."
2,music great disc format not,"Upon reading the reviews for this album, I must agree with ryan ""steelerfan"". it plays in my car, a cheap portable, an old walkman, an old single cd player but not in my new multi disc player which is the best equipment in the house. I also tried to burn a copy in the hopes it would play in the changer but the computer didn't even ""see"" the cd but sure wanted to copy the dvd side---we only have a cd burner not a dvd burner....Even though the songs are great I am so peeved that I want to send it to the record company and tell them where to put it and I will nerer buy another dual disc--a waste of money!"
2,I Would Give It A Higher Rating If I Could Play It On My CD Player,"The music is great. However, I can't play the dual disc thingy on my CD player and I'm really upset about that. I have to listen to the music via my DVD player. That ain't right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Experimenting beyond Matchbox 20,"Sure, there are moments when the leader of Matchbox 20 sounds like his band in this album. There are too songs that bring to mind Justin Timberlake. But Rob Thomas doesn't stop there. In a fashion similar to Gwen Stefani, he experients with a handful of musical styles to come up with his ""Something to Be"" album.Most interesting songs are the ethnic ""All That I Am"" (which blends sounds from at least three different parts of the globe), the R&B; ""Fallin' To Pieces"" and the party-starting ""Streetcorner Symphony"". Best songs, hands down, are the ones that remind the most of his classic Matchbox 20 sound: ""My My My"", bringing to mind other songwriters such as Josh Rouse and Paul Brill; and the closing ""Now Comes The Night""."
4,Me myself and Rob,"Yes this CD is all about Rob Thomas, he explores other areas of his singing style, every now and then you think you're listening to a new Matchbox 20 CD but its all Rob. For a ""Breakout"" album he actually does pretty good especially ""I am an Illusion"" and several other songs on this Grammy predicted CD. For the true lover of Matchbox 20's music you'll get nothing but Rob Thomas who is really all Matchbox. This CD is all about me, myself and I because no one else sings...just Rob."
5,his passion,"This DualDisc shows Rob's pure and passionate feelings for HIS music. He has found ...something to be. He truly is a great songwriter and composer. He has found a way to get into the heart and soul of this 42 year old mother of 2. Both of my girls 22 and 8 love the music too. I've seen Rob in concert 4 times with Matchbox Twenty, but I have to say I do think this style of music is more exotic and meaningful, and when he does do another concert tour, I think it will be very magical."
3,It's DVD-Audio,"I was surprised to see when i popped this guy into my SACD/DVD-A player that it happened to be an actual DVD-A disc.Mediocre music, Rob Thomas was best on the Matchbox 20 album Yourself or Someone Like You, but high quality audio."
3,Rob Thomas Solo,"I enjoyed Rob Thomas's voice in this collection of songs. however, I thought that it wasn't his best work but only the beginning. I had purchased another CD of his which came out later. The music I thought was a better blend both in terms of music itself and then the lyric's. That doesn't mean that solo album number 1 isn't any good no far from it. For a first work I thought it was good and worth anyone who's a fan of Rob Thomas or a person interested in his music should go out and get this one. It's always nice to see were it all began."
2,Good but not the best,"This guide has accurate descriptions, up-to-date maps and a good introductory section. Its drawback is that it only has a very limited sample of hotel and restaraunt listings for many locations (like Monteverde). The descriptions are quite good but limited.I know it is impossible to cover everything, but I cannot deduce a strategy or a pattern used for including some hotels and eliminating others. This is a good guide for a person who is in Costa Rica for 7-10 days and is going to cover so much ground that too much detail would be overwhelming. However, if you intend to travel at a slower pace or spend more time in Costa Rica,there are better choices."
3,Not bad for Harvard College students,"This guidebook has a lot of good info, but it lacks the depth found in other travel guides. The recommendations are largely by and for college students, although other people are catered to. We liked Explore Costa Rica for background information--as well as for its online updates, which we found on the publisher's web site."
2,Very disappointed,"Thought I would give some of Lonely Planet's competition a try, and I was sorely disappointed. The book had little useful information and hardly any accomodation or restaurant listings above their ""1"" rating (which is the least expensive). I ended up finding more useful information from the free maps and brochures I got when I was acutally in Costa Rica. Do yourself a favor and get the Lonely Planet version instead..."
5,Pleasant surprise.,"I arrived home yesterday evening to find this large US Post bag. I was at a loss to remember what I had ordered from overseas. It turned out to be my order from Amazon for Helmut Newton - Sumo. I was so suprised at it's size and weight. For some reason I expected a much smaller version. The work is magnificent and as an amateur photographer it gives me some great ideas for my future work. I agree with the another review about the quality of the photographs but for the price, I think it is excellent value. I am impressed how quicky the book came from Amazon to Australia - I was told it would be the middle of October but I received it on the 30th of September."
3,$$ Books $$,"The book is wonderful when you first open the box, take the stand out first and be carful opening it (watch your fingers) You need 2 people to get the book on the stand. Once it is on the stand it is best not to leave it closed because it is so heavy that the books binding will sag. DO NOT let friends handle the book, or if they do watch over them. If the cover is dropped closed, pages will crease and bend. My Friends love the book more then I do now. Is it worth the thousands I paid for it? Not really. Oh and keep the box it comes with so you are able to sell it easier once you are over it. To keep it real, the only ""cool"" part of owning the book is that you are known for owning it!"
5,a book to bask of,It's a wonderfull book. Topfoto's organised and placed in the best way.It's realy a pleasure to look at it and it's also an ornament to look at itI'm not so good in the english language to discribe this product but i'm very glad to have it.
3,"good for a lobby, not good for a home","The book takes up a lot of space and is interesting for a few minutes if you've never seen it before. This makes it perfect for the lobby of a hip company. It doesn't make sense to own in one's home, though, because you wouldn't want to look at any of the photos more than once or twice. Any Mary Ellen Mark (to mention just one modern photographer) book would be a more interesting long-term companion."
1,"If you want this for your CAT, READ THIS!!!!!","I know that the label reads ""for dogs"" but under the product discription it says that it is safe for cats over 12 weeks. THIS IS NOT TRUE! It contains tea tree oil and lemon essential oils which are both toxic to cats. Please research this before you purchase it."
2,Relatively useless...smells pretty good though,"This product works best on a pet with mild skin issues, in my opinion. It smells nice, not strong, and is not very oily, which is good too. Effective, for my mini-Schnauzer with skin allergies associated with flea bites and otherwise, it is not!! Hence, I have sought other remedies...."
4,compilation that works,"Companies try to make good compilations but never sucseed. This one did. I own the first one and sure there's about five songs on it I enjoy but this one went off the map. Powerful talented artists at their finest. The best mellow and pop women's music of the year all on one CD. I won't get into the artists themselves but I wanted to mention that most of these songs have been featured on ""Dawson's Creek"", another bonus."
5,GREAT BUY,"THIS IS DEFINATELY A GREAT CD. NO MATTER YOUR MUSIC INTERESTS, YOU'LL SURELY FIND THIS CD TO BE SATISFYING !!"
2,"Hard to read, nice to look at","Eduardo Risso is an awesome artist. His work on 100 Bullets is phenomenal. Somehow in this book, however, his work is lacking something. I'm not saying this book isn't well drawn, I'm just saying I've seen way better stuff from Risso. Trillo's story (specifically the dialogue) doesn't do much to help Risso's art. I would reccomend this one only to hardcore fans of Risso. Even then It's hard to reccomend."
1,Some Tracks Are Not Originals,"I bought this CD specifically for the title song, ""Here It Comes Again"".This song is not an original make from the 60's. I consider this song tobe there best even though it is a lost-hit. I know of only one radiopersonality who played this Fortune's song, the late Scott Muni.What a disappointment!Stew Rind"
3,Eh...book does provide good points on environmental geology but many flaws,"There just some notable flaws within this book (I think the reason was that it was a previous version [9th edition] had a problem in publishing) but I do not have the book anymore. This did help me get through my geology class and environmental geology class however, I did not use the book as much as I should of but still used about more than half...Good book for references but don't overlie on it too much"
4,cool ideas,This book was really simple to read and had alot of good info. One of the things I started putting into practice was making herbal popsicles out of herbal teas/ tinctures. My 2 1/2 year old daughter recently had a cold so I made Cold Time Tea ( for kids) added fresh peaches and a few dropperfuls of echinachea/ astragalus mixture in a blender and added the contents to popsicle molds. She loved it. It was such a cool way to get goodness into her without her even realizing it. It helped soothe her throat and it made her feel like she was getting a treat. My husband even had a few because he enjoyed how they tasted.It also had helpful info on herbal dosages for kids which was really helpful for me.
5,needed it,was just what the DM ordered it has brought more fun in the games we have been playing to date
5,Gygax's Grand Farewell,"This is the final piece in the puzzle that is the AD&D rules - Gary Gygax's last major contribution to the game system, before the diluted 2nd edition came out, is displayed in its full glory here. It's obvious that this is a work for intermediate and advanced players, since some of the races and classes here (and the attribute-rolling system!) are over-powered for easier, beginning campaigns. In addition to the dark races (such as the Drow, Duergar, and Svirfneblin), and the advanced classes (such as the Hierophant, Acrobat, Cavalier and my fave, the Barbarian), there's also new weapons, hundreds of new spells, hundreds of new magical items, the deities of the demi-humans, and much more. It's sure to add an entirely new level to your campaigns!"
2,the same remakes as used on other discs,"The versions of the hits on this collection are not the originals on Capitol and MCA, but rather the 1994-1995 remakes that are often licensed and are owned by Sony/ATV Tree music. These remakes are also on ""16 Biggest Hits,"" ""For The Record: 43 Legendary Hits,"" ""Super Hits,"" and other CD's. If you have any of these other collections, you basically have this collection but in a different package and the originals are much superior to this collection."
1,Remakes,"A few years ago, Merle Haggard sat down and remade almost all of his biggest hits in a mamoth recording session. Now all of these songs are spreading around to every cheap record company who repackages them.Be careful, everything here is remakes."
5,Super Diaper Genie,"This is the first time I've ever written a review. I purchased the Diaper Genie 2 - and it IS all it's cracked up to be. We are nearing the end of our second refill and the diaper ""pail"" part of the diaper genie does NOT smell. The baby's room does NOT smell. It is soooo easy to use - one-handed.It's similar to how a Saftey First diaper pail given to me 3 years ago was supposed to work. The difference is that this really does work. I'll gladly purchase the refills in exchange for no smell."
1,Huge disappointment,"My favorite diaper system was discontinued, so I used just a trash can for a while and finally I couldn't stand the baby's room smelling so bad that I broke down and bought the diaper genie II (after reading all the reviews). I was so excited. I set it up in two seconds and we were ready to go. After 4 diapers and only one day of use, every time I opened the lid to push another diaper into the pail, a horrid smell came out of the pail. I emptied the pail the next day and even when it was empty and I put my first diaper in it, there was the smell again. I even put baking soda into the bag, and nothing helps. I nearly gag every time I open the pail. I would return it but I stupidly threw the box out already. What a waste of money! I'm sure it would work fine for newborns who drink breastmilk, since their diapers don't really smell much anyway, but my DD is a toddler. I am totally disappointed. This product is a rip off."
1,Save your money.,I loved this at first. But after two months of daily use the thing broke. I cant get it back together. I think I will just go back to walking the diapers to the regular trash outside.
1,Threw it away on Day 2,"We bought this before our son was born, and threw it away before he was three days old. I refused to give it to someone else, and subject them to such a terribly designed diaper pail. At first I was convinced that we were using it incorrectly. I couldn't conceive that someone intended me to stick my hand into a filthy bag to throw away a diaper. The trap door has a lot of resistance, so you really have to push against the diaper to get it in there. It's impossible to keep the area above the trap door clean, and the hole is pretty small, so even if you've managed to keep yourself relatively clean through the diaper change, when you go to throw the diaper away you'll have crap all the way from your hand to your elbow."
1,Might as well light your money on fire,"You have to give it to Playtex, they have this down to a science. They actually get you to pay $30 for this, then you have to pay $6-$7 for each refill which lasts 2 weeks. The cheap plastic foot will break as well.Tip, if someone gets this for you when you have a baby--punch them in the face. If they didn't give you a gift receipt then just throw it away, you are ahead."
1,don't get this,"This system is horrible, we received it as a gift and without a gift receipt otherwise I would have return this product. How they expect you to push through the spring loaded gate with a filled spoiled diaper is beyond me. This product should be discontinued and the design engineer fired.Skip this and get the Elite. It makes so much more sense with hands free step on to open the gate(just like most of the kitchen trash can.)It receives one star because it does trap the diapers well and there is no smell coming from it.(I disagree with other reviewers giving low stars cause you pay a premium for their proprietary trash bags, you know this buying into the product, it should be no surprise. In addition, this is how most company milk you for money, its an old business tactics modeled after the razor blade cartridges)"
2,spring for the elite,"We first bought the elite and we love it. Thinking a second on another floor in the house would be a good idea, we grabbed this product. The differences, for 10$, are pronounced.The first two differences are quite cosmetic: the genie is a few inches shorter and it does not have a foot pedal. I didn't think this would be a huge issue. Boy was I wrong. This product forces you push the diapers through the opening. Now this doesn't sound bad until you realize that the mechanism used to keep the smell in is very stiff and requires some pressure. This really isn't the most hygienic method of diaper disposal. In fact in really messy diaper and you'll most likely want to shift the bag down some.The rest of the product is ok. Its quite easy to remove the diapers from the product. The razor to cut the bags is fine. The bag replacement system is well designed and easy to replace. However the fact you need to push the diaper through the pail's opening makes this product near worthless."
3,"easy to use, but not completely odor-free","First off, this is the first diaper pail I've owned, so I can't compare to other products. The operation is pretty easy -- after you ""break in"" the opening latch it's easy to open and put the diaper in. I like the push-through mechanism and the sanitary way to dispose of the diapers. However, I don't think it's completely odor-free. When my son makes a stinky diaper I can still smell it for hours. I think I may try to install a deodorizer on the inside of the lid to knock down some of the smell! Also, the refill cartridges are EXPENSIVE -- we go through more than 1 per week and we don't even put all the diapers in the pail!! But, other than that, it's a good product. The bag removal is easy and the cutter works great!"
2,OK BUT Not so great!,"I bought this without reading any review, since I had heard that we should have a diaper genie. the refills are pretty expensive and it fills up very fast. you need to push the diaper beyond the gate and your hands are all messy.Will not recommed this product to others."
4,Best Diaper Genie ever!,"We were introduced to the world of Diaper Genie II at a baby convention in the city that we live in. Diaper Genie was there, demonstrating this product. We ended up buying two. One for the upstairs, one for the downstairs.PROS:Perfect Odor ControlGreat Bag SystemCONS:The spring design inside. It takes alot to shove the diaper down, and sometimes it grabs your hand and you ended up getting, uh... dirty hands.I have heard the Elite has the hands free step underneath it. Thats what his one needed.The blade inside comes off and you have to put it on. Scissors seem more convenient, at least for me.. to cut the bags.It should be self tying or enclosed in its own way.Otherwise, I could not do without my DG2 and I recommend them to anyone I know having a baby, adopting a baby, or not yet converted to this product!Cheers!"
3,Intentionally cryptic instructions,"This is not a bad product if you've used one like it before. But if you haven't, you will have a terrible time figuring out how to use it based on their instructions."
2,Ok for wet but not poopy diapers,This product is ok for wet diapers and keeps smell in ok for them but would never work for larger poopy diapers. You have to push the diaper thru a tight hole and would be unsanitary. I put the poopy diapers in a separte bag and walk take out to trash. Design flaws are : 1) You have to push a diaper through tight hole and does not work for poopy diapers. 2) The refill bag cardtrige has a sharp lip on it and when you stick your hand down to push the diaper in...you have to watch because it scraps and can cut your hand.
1,Another option,"I used diaper Genie with my first child. With my second I am using a Simplehuman stainless steel trash can I got at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $25. You can also find them at Target. You can use you grocery bags in it. The lid closes tight enough, and I find it easier to use."
1,Horrible diaper pail,"I hate this diaper pail. I had the neat safety 1st pail and the product was discontinued, there was never any odor from it at all when inserting a dirty diaper. I bought the Diaper Genie 2 after reading the reviews and am so disappointed every time you put a dirty diaper in terrible dirty diaper odors escape even if there are only a few diapers in the pail.Also you have to change the pail every other day. You would be better off just throwing the diapers in the trash."
3,"Works well, but costs alot over time","The Diaper Genie II does a great job of controlling the odor of dirty diapers, but since it uses its own special bags, you have to continually buy refills! At nearly $7/refill (which doesn't last very long), you go broke buying refills! Get the Diaper Champ, which works just as well but accepts standard (cheap) trash bags."
2,Not really worth it.,"I received this as a gift at my baby shower and I was really unimpressed. First off, it doesn't hold in the smell. Second off, the refills are somewhat expensive long term. I ended up using it only for wet diapers and not solid ones. What has worked best for me was just taking grocery bags and tying up the soiled diapers in those. I have also had friends who used this model and they got maggots and worms in the bottom of the bucket. I think there are other solutions."
2,Refills are a money pit and total scam. Other than that it works well.,The Diaper Genie II does what it says and keeps odors at bay. Unfortunately when you factor in the $6 refills it's not worth the total yearly cost of $200+. Save your money and get the Diaper Champ or another diaper system that allows you to use regular garbage or grocery bags.
1,two have broken in 7 months,"I used the diaper genie 10 years ago when my kids were babies and I loved it. I bought it again this year when we had another baby. The first one we had broke within weeks. The company sent us another one, but it took about 6-8 weeks for us to receive it. Now the second one has broken again. The pedal gets stuck, which prevents the diaper genie from opening. It's completely useless..."
1,Fatal design flaw do not buy,"Avoid this product. It is so poorly designed I can not believe it is in production. When the spring trapdoor assembly breaks, and it will, there is no way to put it back together."
3,broke after 6 months,"Ours broke after about 6 months - one of the top flaps that open and shut with the pedal don't open, so getting a huge, full diaper in there without getting a mess of poop on my hands is a challenge. We're thinking of tossing it and getting a little trash can instead. Waste and a huge, honking piece of plastic (as everything is these days). A big waste."
5,I couldn't live without the Diaper Gennie !,"""I couldn't live without the Diaper Gennie !""...that was my husband's comment after the first day of using it, and he is not easily amused.Now, is the most useful gift that we want to give to all our friends that have a baby.It is REALLY easy to use, no odors..none. We have been using it for 1 year and three months now, so please be confident that this item worth the money."
4,"Pretty Good, Simple to Use Diaper Pail","This diaper pail is better than the original Genie, in my opinion. This pail doesn't require twisting, so the bag doesn't unravel and thus defeat its purpose of odor blocking existence. Second, the springs are pretty good (usually) on the closure mechanism, I had to fix it one time, but it's been 8 weeks and it still does just fine, and I usually don't have to worry about getting any icky diaper residue on my hands when I put them in there because I usually close the diapers up really tight when I'm done changing the little one. I also keep a bottle of Purell by the changing table. Overall, really good diaper pail."
2,"No lock, can smell previous diaper","We own two diaper genies, one original, one ""no. 2."" I agree that many things are improved over the last model....such as the cutting system for example.However, while it doesn't smell when it is just sitting around, whenever you push a new diaper through you get a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE smell from the previous diaper during the split second that the spring is open to push the diaper through. Then you get to enjoy that HORRIBLE HORRIBLE smell for even longer as it makes its potent way around the room. The old twistaway NEVER had any odor. I'm embarrassed to have anyone (parents, babysitters) use this one. It is horrendous.Also, the old version had a child-proofed lid. NO, I did not need two hands to open the old version. On the new one my 20 month old toddler can just open the top right up and put things inside.I also miss the handle that used to be on the back for carrying it around."
1,Sucks! I mean it stinks! AND.....,"First off we have twins. We had one of the older styles, which it appears Playtex has stopped supporting for refills, so we changed to this Diaper Genie Essentials Pail. What a terrible design! Trying to stuff the soiled diaper into this thing you can and at times do get pee and poop on your hands. Why? Because the flawed design forces you to push the soiled diaper between two flexible gates and down into the actual catcher, which means the pressure from the flexible gates compresses the soiled diaper and squeezes the contents out. This system does not, like the previous version, hold or reduce the smell either. My suggestion? If you can find a better solution get it! This solution is NOT worth the stench nor the crap on your hands."
1,"Hate this, get the Delux","I accidentally broke my Diaper Genie Delux so I picked this one up not knowing the difference between the two. I HATE it. While the Delux has its own set of problems, I actually couldn't live without it. But this version is just terrible. First of all, it's smaller than it looks so I can only fix a few size 6 diapers in before I have to change it. But the worst part is that without the foot pedal, you have to SQUISH the diapers down into the Diaper Genie, and my hands always get dirty. I don't see the point in even offering this model for sale. I hate it!"
2,Stinks,"I received this as a shower gift and at first really liked it. This works great for infant diapers but as far as toddler diapers go just throw the diapers in the trash. This works good for my daughters wet ones but if they are dirty I don't even put them in here anymore because they stink. When you open the lid to put a new diaper in, if you have already disposed of a dirty diaper you get the whiff of it. And you have to open up the container from the bottom to cut the bag for when you are going to dispose of the diapers and when you cut the bag the aroma of the diapers fills the air and the smell lingers for awhile :/ I think for my next child I'll have to search for a different diaper pail."
2,OK but I'm going to try the Elite version.,This diaper genie does a wonderful job of concealing the odor until you have to put another diaper inside. You literally have to stick your hand into the pail and then your hand comes out smelling like the dirty diapers that are stewing inside. Not a great plan: I looked at the Elite and you do not have to put your hand inside so I'm going to return this one and try the other.
1,Awful,"We used it for less than a month when our baby was just born. It held about 10 infant diapers, I cant imagine how many toddler diapers it would hold, 1? It was disgusting to have to push a dirty poopy diaper into that contraption. And in the end it still smelled. I actually returned mine it was so horrible. I would usually not return something my daughter's poop had touched, but this was such a horrible product I couldn't imagine supporting the company who made it.In the end we switched to cloth. They are amazingly easy to use and clean, way cheeper than disposables and they don't sit in a landfill for 500 YEARS! Thats how long disposables take to degrade. That is disgusting, great legacy for your baby to leave behind... I honestly feel guilty for even using disposables for a few weeks. SWITCH TO CLOTH!!"
2,Beautiful from the outside,"It took me quite some time to assemble it. The hinges were crooked, and the lid won't click in place.I read that it holds around 200someting diapers....my eyeballs popped out: who in their right mind would store so many diapers (or only 10)in a trash can and not take it out?? I mean, I would have preferred they focused on other details they left out such easability to maneuver or some nice mat under it, or a support for a sanitizer or some baby wipes, etc. attached to it !I probably did not need it or hoped it will be more to it. It is not more to it.But I like the color and ..and the dignity it carries standing next to my baby's crib."
2,go with the Champ,"Since I am not willing to cram my fingers into a poop filled diaper, I am no willing to use this product as planned. The only way I can get the diaper in like they intend is to take a plastic clothes hanger and stuff the diaper in. Doesnt sound too bad? You have to keep a plastic hanger with poop on it somewhere.A friend of ours has a Diaper Champ and I will be purchasing one as soon as possible."
1,fatal design flaw,"This product does keep the stink away, and it's easy to use. But it has what I consider a fatal design flaw. When the bags run out, the last length just slips right out of the holder, and you end up with no bag left in the top part of the genie. If you're not watching, you can easily stick a diaper into the genie without a bag. I go through a lot of bags with my twins, so this has happened on more than one occasion. Really irritating."
3,It works,"I had the Deluxe Diaper Genie with the foot pedal, however, husband crammed too many dirty diapers into it and broke it. Since we didn't pay for the original Diaper Genie, we decided to downgrade to this. Definitely a good product but I miss the convenience of the other genie. If you don't have a genie now, you will be pleased with this model. Still does the job without the bells and whistles."
1,Bad design,"We had the first generation Genie and it broke after a few years. It was a bit complex but I really liked it and it held up well to the use. We bought the second generation to replace the first, thinking it would be better and we were wrong!!!!. Though It is simpler it is poorly designed. It has a spring hinged flap that keeps the poopy diapers sealed off, the problem is that you have to push the poopy diaper down into the bag past the flap, and if there is any stray poop on the diaper it smears on the top side of the flap. This presents two problems, one there is poopy smell and two, if you are trying to push the diaper down into the receptical, your hand has to brush past the same place on the flap...not good. If you want a genei buy the first generation...not this one"
2,Used for Adult diaper,I bought this for my mom when she is staying with me. She uses depends type disposible incontinence underwear. I ended up taking the spring trap off as it kept falling apart. With adult diapers there is more material to put in the pail so I agree with others that the spring load was not handy. I have found that the pail holds more since I removed the spring and I just use scissors to cut the bag and take the bag to the trash. One disk of bag material lasted 1.5 weeks. Even though the spring was missing there wasn't an odor after the door was closed. I admit I use my cat's litter box deodorizer to help with the odors. I wish they made one with a larger opening for the adult size diapers.
3,We have a love/hate relationship,"I have a love/hate relationship with this product. We are on our either our second or third in a 1 year span...I have lost track. Here is what I love and don't love...Don't Love:Finicky design that can easily get off track and malfunction. This is what has caused the returns in the past.EXPENSIVE refills that are needed probably each month.Awkward removal of waste bag.Love:Contains the smell mostly. Once we started with solid foods, we started double-bagging and taking the bag out immediately.Hands-free design makes use much easier. I don't have to touch anything gross.Sleek exterior design is unobtrusive and blends in with nursery.In all, I have just come to terms with the fact that I will probably be buying a diaper waste system yearly to keep it from getting stinky or gross and because I don't think that they are designed to hold up over time. I may try a different option next time that works with trash bags, and not specific refills."
4,Happy Noses!,"I was happy to find this for my newborn's stinky surprises. It really helped contain the smell to a VERY dull whisper. It doesn't contain ALL of the smell, but pretty darn close. Much better than any other random garbage with a lid. Very easy to empty and reline. Refills are almost reasonably priced and very easy to refill. Just wish it could house more diapers."
3,Great until it broke,"I praised this diaper pail until it broke. My son is only 6 months old and the pail already needs to be replaced. It actually started breaking when he was about four months but we've manage to make it work until today. The mechanism that opens the two inside flaps broke off on one side and today the other side broke as well. Now there is no way to get the diapers into the pail. I'm not sure where to go from here. I wouldn't mind buying another one, but they are not exactly cheap and I don't want to have to replace it again. I would still recommend this item to others but with caution."
2,It stinks!,"Literallly! I had to buy an air purifier to combat the smell! Not only do you get a horrifying smell every time you open it to put a diaper in..but the smell leaks out. It is alot easier to use than the original, but I am thinking of giving this one away, and buying the original. We had one that was a hand-me-down, and it broke, so we thought we would try the new one, thinking it would be better. I wish I had just stuck with what I knew!"
4,Guitar player's guitar player,"Not everybody ""gets"" Amos Garrett. His solos can sound casual and offhand -- that is, until you try to play them. And that's why he's a ""guitar player's guitar player."" He doesn't dazzle. He's subtle. Even odder, for a rock musician, he's pretty unimpressed with himself. Consequently, he's never out to show the world what a barnburner he is. He just likes to play what he likes to play, and to sing in his foggy Hoagy Carmichael voice. I really like this recording precisely because Garrett does not make a big deal out of his amazing dexterity on the guitar. This is NOT Mr. Ultimate Speedfingers rockin' the joint. It is --dare I say this -- pleasant to listen to. Seldom has so much guitar technique been used to reach such modest ends."
1,Look for another book!,"The numerous grammar and coding errors in this book make it one to completely avoid if you are new to PHP programming. Fortunately, I was familiar enough with PHP to catch most of the coding errors.The thing that probably bothered me the most was the fact that many of the explanations of the code given in the book refer to code that isn't even printed in the book! The explanations seemed to refer to a previous revision, rather than the code in the final printed version. Whoever was the project manager and/or proofreader of this book should be shamed and then fired."
1,Sloppy,"I gave up on this book due to the abundance of coding errors. Each time there was a mistake in their code, it took me quite a lot of time to figure out what the error was and fix it - time I don't have, when trying to learn something new.Wrox needs to be tougher with its authors and technical reviewers. Instead of accepting that errors are just part of the publishing experience, they should be trying to inculcate a culture of meticulousness and excellence. Until then, people like me will drop their books flat."
1,Beginning PHP,"I have always felt that WROX books were the best computer books on the market, until I read this one. There are tons of grammatical errors, which I can deal with. However, the syntax errors are far too numerous for this type of book. Also, some of the programs do not do what they are suppose to. If you are new to PHP, then stay away from this book. I am glad I bought this book from Amazon and paid a discounted price instead of buying it from WROX and paid the full cover price. At least I minimized the money I wasted on this book."
3,"Helpful for the beginner, but watch out for typos","I'm new to PHP (with some experience in HTML and C++) and I found this a good ground-floor introduction to the basics of the language. It also walks you through setting up your own web server (which I had found intimidating, but this book made it fairly easy).That said, there are a LOT of typos, both in the text and the code. For that reason, I would not recommend buying this book at full price (I got it for free at the library).Readers should take everything with a grain of salt and also should consult the publisher's ""erratum"" page before reading: http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0764557831,descCd-view_errata.htmlAnd a memo to the authors: next time, use spell check!"
3,"Too verbose, too many typos, too many authors","Wrox books used to stand for quality but not anymore. I'm a web developer (MS tools mostly) and wanted to expand my skillset to include PHP. I relied on Wrox before but never again. I found so many typographical errors in both text and code samples. The errata download is useless since it missed 90% of the errors. The chapters seem to run on and on and on without fully explaining ALL of the code used in the samples [ie. code contains ""this->var"" but doesn't explain what ""->"" does]. There doesn't seem to be any consistency through out the book. Shame, the editing of this book probably suffered due to the transfer of ownership when Wiley took it over from Wrox Publishing. I'd suggest reading the PHP 5 manual that can be downloaded from from the PHP website. You can cover more in 30 minutes reading the online manual than you would in 8 hours reading this book."
3,"Not a bad starting point, but could use a proof read.","This book has been very helpful in my Web Programming class. I've caught a few errors in their example programs, but it's been simple syntax errors that are easily caught. Also there have been a few comical spelling errors as well. There are a few things that our professor has pointed out as being outdated. Overall it's been an alright book."
2,a little dissapointed,"First off, I found many errors, grammatical and in their code, within the first three chapters. Then, to make sure I was on the right track I referenced the exercise solutions in Appendix A. They use code that they don't even introduce for another 400 pages. The first couple chapters are okay at teaching with syntax and showing how to write good code. Not great or outstanding, not even good... just okay. I'm definitly going to stay away from Wrox when I buy more programming books. Anybody have an awesome PHP book they want to sell me?"
1,Not what you expecting,That company is different now.THE sample is only for Local machine.NOT FOR TRUE WORLD.that Code you download from there WEB site CAN NOT BE open.You will have to BUY another SOFTWARE to read those sample CODE.ANOTHER choise is type in by yourself.
5,"Ah-ha upon ah-ha, LOL",Don't you just love those teachers who bring forth multiple ah-has for you? Paul definitely makes that happen here. My teaching experience expanded tremendously after watching this video. I've watched it many times now to glean ever-more tidbits. Great for those with an A&P background but certainly helpful for those who just want to deepen their understanding of the body as it relates to asanas.
3,it was ok,I was expecting anatomy about muscles. this is just him lecturing about joint movement. also the info he presents about fascia is outdated (I do realize that the sudy of Fascia is moving at a quick pace). I kept waiting for more info about the muscles around the joints. The info about the mobility of joints is good...I was just expecting more.
4,"excelent speech, but with no subtitles","The DVD is excelent, Paul speaks very clear and in a good speed. The subject is just fantastic.But as my wife (who is the real yoga teacher, not me) doesn't speak english, so i am the one who's translating the contents. The subtitles are a necessary thing, on globalization era."
4,Grilley's Anatomy for Yoga,"Having already taken a number of anatomy courses, this DVD was a nice review with tidbits of new information. Good resource to have on hand for yoga teachers. I agree with his philosophy."
3,Okay but on the lower spectrum,Fine. But does not have the ANSI rating directly on the safety glasses. I have to carry the paperwork to prove it is ANSI rated.
1,unprofessional labels attempt to ca$h in,"This CD accidentally caught my eye when browsing Amazon's site for Placido Domingo's CDs. There are a lot of pirated recordings, live recordings of questionable quality, but this one is a true marvel. Did anyone at this label happen to notice that the tenor on this CD's cover picture is actually... Jose Carreras?"
4,Very helpful,"I found this book to be very helpful. I especially liked the segment on guns. We live in a society that wants to blame the gun for the violence instead of the person holding the gun. There is nothing wrong with guns, but we must be diligent in our instruction to our boys that they are not toys. They are weapons that can be used for good causes.(example: protecting our country) This book was a good reminder that our little boys will one day be men and the training must begin now."
4,Future Men,"This book is one of our ""often-quoted"" books. We find the lessons coming back into our heads years after we read it. It has been very helpful for us raising our son. Although it is controversial, Doug Wilson's idea that you teach your son how to do things before the world teaches them is a good idea. I don't own a gun nor have any use for a gun, I will try to give my son an appreciation for proper and self-controlled enjoyment of alcoholic drinks before the world does. We do pray that he will be a Future Man."
2,Not impressed,"(husband's review) To me, Mr. Wilson comes across as fairly legalistic in this book. He does not seem to offer much practical advice on parenting or mentoring young men. He spends a significant amount of time focusing on dangerous temptations and destructive cultural lifestyles, while often reminding the reader not to be overly legalistic. The book has lofty goals but fails to deliver. I am a conservative Christian, a new father with 1 young son & another on the way. I hope that I will find other Christian authors that will impart more wisdom on raising boys. Although I appreciate Mr. Wilson's aims, I would not recommend this book."
1,Patriarchal Hooey,"I was looking into classical christian homeschooling at one point, because I thought that it might have someting to do with re-establishing the rigor of earlier forms of instruction. After looking at people like Wilson at thought better of it. Much of what is called classical christian education is like this: worship of a bizarre fantasy of the past (espcially the old South and its pompous, lazy aristoracy) mixed with enough Latin, Logic, and Rhetoric to to make the students and parents feel superior to all those public school kids who waste their time learning the ideals of democracy. I will give this to Wilson: unlike many fundamentalists, he's pretty open about his belief in patriarchy. The only thing scarier than this guy are the people who idolize him. His ideas about manhood have nothing to do Jesus or christianity, and his ideas about women are downright evil."
1,Another badly made shot on video flick.,"Keeper of Souls is a terrible movie filled with non-sequiters,bad acting and a laughable screenplay. There are a lot of good and watchable low budget films out there, sadly this isn't one of them. All you need to make a decent movie is to have a good camera, competant actors, lighting and a decent script. This movie has none of those.Stay away!!!!"
1,Overpriced,"These are $5 more than the box of 36 Sassy Baby Changing pads, also sold on Amazon. The Sassy ones also work better in my opinion. Skip these and save yourself some money."
1,Very small in size - might as well use paper towel,"These are very small in size and ""paper-towel-like"", kinda feel like napkins that are made with recycled paper. We bought a pack and just couldn't use it because it is so small. I'd rather just use paper towel instead if I were to use these. For us we now use the babies R Us brand, they are much bigger and has a plastic feel to it, which is much more durable."
5,Great item!!!,This was the best purchase!! These work great and have saved our changing pad from being stained!!! They are just like the paper they put under your chin at the dentist office - and they work great!!! We use each one a few times - unless it gets dirty on the first use - then just toss it. Great to have in the diaper bag as well - don't feel so bad using the changers in the bathroom with these!!!
5,Can't live without 'em,"This product has been an absolute lifesaver...I have never seen such a thin sheet of paper absorb so much of EVERYTHING! My daughter frequently chooses to pee as soon as her diaper is off, and these pads have saved me again and again from having to wash her changing pad cover. I use them under her when she naps in places other than her crib. Can't say enough great things about this product!"
4,Save yourself lots of laundry!,"I love these and will be buying more. I like that is made of tissue paper and nothing plastic. They absorb pretty well--I admit that when my son decides to pee in the middle of a diaper change the sheet does get wet very fast, but 95% of the time it doesn't leak into my changing pad sheet. I usually throw away the wet peewee pad right away so it doesn't have time to leak anyway. These really are a lifesaver and save me from excess washing of the changing pad cover. I only wish that Amazon sold the 108 ct instead of just the 36 ct pack."
1,Horrible! Don't waste your money!,"These pads do NOT absorb pee! My baby girl likes to pee when her diaper has just been taken off inbetween me taking the dirty diaper away and putting the new one under her. If she pees on this pad, it runs all over the place, including on her and onto the cotton changing pad that I am trying to protect (defeating the purpose of my buying these pads). The Huggies brand has only 8 in a package, but they are MUCH larger and they absorb pee. Do not waste your money on PeeWee pads!"
1,Dummies should not be installing Linux...,"...and they shouldn't be writing books either. This book was completely frustrating for me. I am an avid DOS/Windows user who wanted to give Linux a spin. Now, I consider myself quite knowledgeable when it comes to the inner workings of a computer, but I knew I'd need help with how Linux interacted with the PC. This book provided no help whatsoever. Every time I had a question about setting up any part of Linux, the author's response eventually was ""Go find a Linux geek."" That's why I bought this book -- I needed a Linux geek to show me what I can do. If you can follow screen prompts and know your hardware, this book will provide no help for you."
2,"Not totally useless, far worse than other Dummies books.","I must agree with some of the disparaging remarks made by other readers. the book wastes far too much time on puns, and spends far too little time on commands. Example: on page 42, Chapter 4 of my edition, the book tells you to type ""startx"" to start the Control Panel (after installing XWindows). Inexplicably, it then doesn't tell you what to do next until page 107, Chapter 9! If the book hadn't included the CD, I would have rated it lower."
2,Worthwhile only for the RedHat CD,"This book was not very helpful at all. It does not seem to be geared to an expeirenced Linux user, or to beginnning users. Covers only a fraction of the comands, and not very well at all. The book itself recomends buying other Linux books. Wastes amazing amout of space on silly puns."
2,"Not for serious Linux users, only for windows type users","I'm not a serious programmer, but I've done some C++ programming and was looking for a dipper look into Linux. Unfortunately this book is about a Windows Type Operating System (Red Hat Fedora) and how to installing it and use it. If you're are tired of Windows and all its problems this is the book for you.Easy to understand and comes with a DVD with the software"
2,'Installing Linux for Dummies' is a more apt title.,"As the subject line suggests this is a great book for getting Linux set up on your system. Linux setup can be a pain, but having a guide like this is a good idea.However, beyond the installation the author covers very little. The is absolutely very, very little on Linux networking. Frankly that's the main reason someone may want to deal with Linux. The enclosed CD has an antique version of RedHat.Also, in a desperate attempt to be trendy some of the side bar articles are completely useless (ie 'Polish Connection', 'Alternative CD uses', etc.) They were out of place and a complete waste of time. The standard 'For Dummies' jokes are fine, but it should at least have something to do with the subject.There are a few technical errors, such as claiming NT isn't a multi-user OS (!) and a few minor hardware misprints.Bottom line: Great book to get you installed and started. Not a book to get for a serious reference."
2,Linux For Dummies isn't for dummies,"As a Newbie to Linux, who has tried installations of Red Hat Linux 5.2, 6.0, Caldera 1.3 and Mandrake 5.3, I found that this book was not much help in directing me how to get started with using Linux and Linux applications. Perhaps it would be useful as a reference later.I also scanned The Complete Idiot's Guide To Linux and found that this was much more helpful in its organization and material for a Newbie.As it happens, I get lots of advice and encouragement from several local Linux users groups."
4,An interesting book....,"The first Linux book I ever bought was a mistake: Linux Unleashed (2nd ed), whose first few chapters are possibly the worst I have ever read in my life. When I bought this book, Linux for Dummies, it resurrected my interest in this new operating system, to the extent that I now use Linux in my desktop.There are probably many Linux books out there which are more complete, more detailed, or more technically useful, but for personal reasons I wouldn't part with this book.What is a good book, after all? To me, it is one that teases and makes me do things I wouldn't have done otherwise. The rest can follow!"
2,Focuses on installing and configuring; too basic,"This book was a true disappointment. The bulk of the text focused mainly on installing and configuring Linux, which seemed like a repeat of the Red Hat installation docs (which are free). The author did not really focus on showing how to use Linux to any degree of productivity, which will come as a true disappointment to computer literate readers who are exploring Linux for the first time."
1,As far as the Dummies series books goes this one flopps!,"If you already know something about Linux this book may be an ok reference. The installation instructions leave more than a bit to be desired. The book is for those that have an installed version of Linux and want to start to use it. As an intro to a working system it rates 2 stars but as a primer for the novice that wants to install Red Hat look elsewhere. This book is a must not buy. I got more from the Docs on the CD, and as terse and cryptic as they are that is really saying something about the book. Like don't waste your money here. For a low cost way to acquire Red Hat, Go for it, but the software will change soon... Better think hard before getting it! Is it really worth it?"
2,"this should be called ""linux by a dummy""","the included red hat is an old, incomplete version, presumably included as a teaser to get you to buy the retail version. the instructions are poor and as another person mentioned, it doesnt give straightforward instructions about basic things like how to set up your modem and add hardware, which is the reason i bought the book in the first place. also the parts on unix are too basic. avoid this book or at the very least wait for a new edition. even better, stick with windows or macintosh, which are clearly superior to linux if you arent running a server. james smith's ""review"" should be characterized as ""irrelevant comments by a dummy"""
1,Installation of Linux for Complete Idiots,"This book is awful. I mean terrible. It is so basic. Let's be honest, dummies are not going to use Linux. It just isn't reality. Techie people are going to. This book is too remedial and leaves out a lot of detail for those who want more nitty gritty about how the OS operates. It does do a section on command line which I find bizarre as no dummie would ever jump into console when they could use the GUI."
4,"it's okay, but needs a little work","The overall content is good, but some places are skimpy. I tried to connect to the internet using the instructions it gave me, but Linux won't let me connect. Also, it only includes Red Hat version 5.2, not 6.0."
3,Could be better.,"While this book is a decent resource for the first time user it has its problems. For one, the author is very opinionated and passes off his opinion as fact. Secondly, it overcomplicates certain things such as telling you to use /sbin/ifup ppp0 where simply ifup ppp0 will do. I can see the reason for doing this, but for a Dummies book I think it should be simple and to the point. Also, the author states that you cannot use the included cd for an AMD or Cyrix cpu (Intel only). This is outright incorrect and has probably disuaded thousands of people from using the cd. A major fumble. It worked fine on my Cyrix and AMD machines. It sometimes seems like the author is working for Red Hat and Intel. On the positive side, it does contain good tips and shortcuts, some of which I haven't found in ""real"" Linux books. If you do buy it, you will need another book to supplement it as it is limited."
1,Dummies shouldn't run Linux.,"Linux, Like UNIX from which it is descended, is not an operating system for dummies. If you are a dummy, get (but don't buy) windoze. I am amazed at the arrogance of the author. Linux is a beautifully complex system, which no 'dummy' could ever hope to comprehend. If you are indeed a dummy, linux is just not for you; you will have little success. As a great man once said: ""UNIX _is_ user friendly, it is just particular about which users it is friendly to"""
1,Not worth the money,"I got this book at a book store because I wanted to get off Winblows and use a real OS. Unfortunately, I hadn't realized that Amazon.com lets users rate books. I'd never have bought it had I known. Well, now I have to get another book. I couldn't get far into the installation. The directions in the book told me a totally different story than what was actually happening on the CD. An extreme waste of time and money! Do a search for a better book, this one's not good at all! (I don't know about the rest of the book, but it doesn't matter because it's impossible to install). Get Teach yourself Linux in 24 hours, which got 4 stars, instead of 2."
2,"Not quite good enough to buy, worth a glance","This is one of the poorer Dummies titles, for the first big problem is installing Linux. If you were attracted to the format of this book, then instead wait for Linux Secrets With CDROM "" by Nabajyoti Barkakati "" List Price: $49.99 which leads you by the hand in a much better way, but get the SUSE installation to go with Barkakati's forthcoming (October 1998) book. The only worse book you could buy is Linux Discovered"
3,A Beginner's Review,"This book has many useful tips that are not mentioned in other books, but can sometimes lead you to a different direction. It doesn't seem to be consistant with Red Hat. I still had to figure out some configurations. Not good for the beginner."
2,Disappointing.....,"I must say that I agree with the majority of what has already been said. I am pretty much a 'dummy' when it comes to Linux, but I do know what constitutes good help and advice. Too often in this book I felt that I was only being told half the story. This is a reasnobly cheap book, but once I'd finished it, the words 'get what you pay for..' sprang to mind."
2,Not what I expected...,"Well I opened this book at the bookstore and it looked OK at first glances. I got it home and managed to get an install of RedHat going, but I had to forget the networking bit because my ethernet card wasn't detected, and did the book explain what to do if it wasn't? No. Therefore my linux system was useless as I had no network. When I followed some HOWTO's, it seemed half the commands (such as make config was not even located in /usr/src/linux, in fact it was no-where and the book doesn't explain why.Dissappointing, don't buy this book."
1,Poorly rewritten 2nd Ed.,"Tis trully sad when a second edition such as this one comes out and is more out of date than the first edition. This version contains poor documentation, poor layout and an overall poor treatment of the OS. If you like the dummies series, get the out of print 1st edition, it is much better."
1,This book blows,"I was so completely unimpressed. Running from one end of the spectrum to another, if one was completely new to linux (aka, has just heard of it and thought this book was the answer), they would be completely let down, and cursing themselves for opening the plastic sleeve (meaning they could not return it). A complete waste of money. I suggest Red Hat Linux Unleased (Third Edition, contains Redhat 5.2). RedHat Linux Unleashed is an excellent RESOURCE book, for those with a good understanding, but nowhere mastering, of linux."
2,This book is not good.,"I love the Dummies books, but this book doesn't help much in understanding the main things a newbie wants to know how to do. I know, I am one."
1,Not very relevant material,"Obviously, others have spoken well on this subject (but I have to enter my two cents). There have been plenty of times when I'd searched for quick, plain-English answers to everything from installation tips (when a search through Deja News served me better) to how to use glint -- only to find little if any use. I applaud the author's attempt to cover finding the lowest common denomenator for something as complex as Linux. This is not a book for total newbies, however. A better choice might be ""Using Linux."""
5,Amazed,When I got this I was so excited I'm a major die hard Michael Jackson fan this is exactly everything I hoped for Yes some quality is bad but that doesn't matter really Everything Was worth the price Best Gifti've ever gotten <3
3,Interviews???,"Volume one was pretty good. At least positive Michael interviews. The second is a great disappointment. Most of the 2nd volume is a deposition of a suit filed against Michael. It is just him answering questions about songs he wrote. He is exhausted from a concert the night before and the attorneys are asking these repetitive questions. This goes on for hours and Michael is extremely patient, but obviously very tired and having a hard time concentrating. But that isn't the main problem with the video. It is advertised as an INTERVIEW and it isn't. I feel cheated. It surprised me that others were not frustrated about that. I'm sure the other cd's labeled interviews volume 1 and 2 is the same thing as the Mega Box. I haven't seen the rest of it yet, but sneaking a deposition in and calling it an interview was a great disappointment."
3,Not great quality,"I received the ""Megabox"" yesterday, and have just started viewing it. So, this review just covers vol. 1. The first DVD contains various interviews with MJ (Oprah's interview, Sylvia Chase's, etc). Most are readily available on youtube, but this collection does bring them together in one place. That's the one advantage of the collection.The picture and sound quality vary. Some have exceedingly poor sound and visual quality--obviously transferred from an old video. But it does make interesting viewing for MJ fans if you can put up with the sketchy quality.The 32-page booklet is nothing special--very flimsy paper quality--just an overview of his career with a few good pictures.It will be interesting to see what's on the other DVD's. The booklet should have contained a contents listing for the entire set."
1,You need to describe products you sell!,I agree with the previous review - you must describe the content of the products you sell- what are these 4 dvds of? they could contain anything including crappy 'docus' that MJ fan would rather burn than buy. so please explain...if you enlarge the picture I can at least read: 'these programmes contain no music by the artist'
1,REFUND - not what was advertised,"when i read what was advertised about this product, i bought it cos i thought that i was getting a discography of MJ, for my kids, instead i got a dvd full of interviews of his life... i dont want my to know about his messy discusting life issues.. 'that'.. is not for children, i also lost money in having to return this, so who eveer this company is, i will refuse to purchase any products from them in the future"
4,Very Nice,Other than a few videos with bad quality this is a very nice box collection. Its nice to see how Michael reacts to his fans at the store signing. (Any Fan Would Like This)
2,Michael Jackson Mega box,This was disappointing...packaging was less than I expected and content was not anything near the expectations I held. rating (poor).
4,I like to the footage but....,This was a good collection but some of it was just too drawm out... The interviews and court room footage was good stuff I'd never viewed before but the cd signings were so long! LOL! Thank God for the few ppl who made it an unforgettable experience! If you are a fan you will like this... hopefully! I did. :-)
3,Mega Box,"This is a two disc set without an accurate, detailed description. Box one is an assortment of home movies and interviews rolled together without being in chronologic or any other type of order. Box 2 is a series of stills taken by the fans and crowds. Very open, but it's like watching your neighbors home movies out of sequence. This is good for viewing Michael as the shy and creative young man he was."
5,Another great year with Doonesbury!,"Trudeau continues to entertain us with his exceptional satire and cartooning.I have been a fan of his work for many years.His political observation never leaves a stone unturned;even when it should be.His artwork continues to advance the benchmark of drawing comics.The greatest thing we all lost with Kerry losing the 2004 Presidental Election,was what Trudeau had in mind for his character representation--oh,well.This book is very well sumarized in the editorical review,so I won't repeat.In this, one the strip is covered from Jul.1,2002 to Jul.19,2003.The book has 152 pages,of which 48 are in color.Too bad all were not in color because color adds a lot to the strip.In Toronto ,it is in color every day and II feel sorry for those who must be satisfied with black and white.That may be OK for Crossword Puzzles,but passe for comics.By the way,Check out the feature article on Doonesbury in the Aug 4,2004 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine."
1,bad bad bad bad bad...,"I have not bought the colection but reading the comics I have figured out that while it claims to be so cynical,it's actually more politically correct than funky winkerbean...if that's possible."
3,"Archer's still entertaining, but lacking originality","As eager as I was to see which media magnate would come out on top, I was disappointed by the similarities between this novel and Kane and Abel and, like the reader from Wisconsin (below), I was also dismayed by the poorly developed storylines. (I also noticed the many typographical errors in the papaerback copy.)In short, after reading several of his other novels, I expected more of Archer. I hadven't read his latest yet, but I hope it is not such a half-hearted effort."
2,I didn't expect this from Mr. Archer,I used to be an ardent fan of Jeffrey Archer. I have read Kane & Abel and the Prodigal Daughter umpteen number of times. But his recent books are a big disappointment for me. I really wish that he comes up with a different storyline other than Kane & Abel and builds on it for a while.
2,The Fourth Estate,"I was very disappointed with the state of this book. It was in very poor condition and stained. I knew that it was second-hand but it was stated that it was in ""good"" condition."
2,"a mediocre novel, full of errors","I have enjoyed many of Mr. Archer's novels, but this one did not seem to be up to his usual standard. Like ""Kane and Abel"" and ""First Among Equals,"" it tells the life stories of ambitious men who become bitter rivals. However, the characters were not likable, which made it difficult for me to identify with their struggles.More damagingly, one of the characters was from a Jewish background, but the novel is full of the most elementary errors about Jewish culture. The author obviously did no research in this area. I can't help wondering whether the book also contains errors about Australian culture (the background of the second character) which I was unable to spot."
1,What's wrong Mr. Archer?,"I am an ardent fan of Archer's and have read every single book of his. However, this book confirmed my belief that Mr Archer is going senile. Am I the only one who noticed the likeness of the plot of this book to that of Kane And Abel? How can you rip-off your own book? I simply couldn't believe that any human, let alone an author, could steal his own story line. If you're an Archer fan and want to remain so, I STRONGLY suggest you stay clear of this book. It's reall ynot worth the disillusionment."
2,The only good thing about it was I finished,"After reading Honor Among Thieves (my first Archer book), I was extremely disappointed with this book. Half of the book was irrelevant. Now reading Kane & Abel and it is amazingly similar - although so far much more to the point."
3,Are you sure you wanna read this?!,"This is a book meant only for first time Archer readers. If you've never so much as take a glance at a story by this master of storytellers, then go ahead take the plunge. You'll definitely find this an immensely witty and exciting tale of two highly ambitious men fighting for fame and fortune. As for all the Jeffrey Archer fans, who is like myself, out there you will sadly be disappointed as this is merely like a merging of two great novels that spellbound all of us, ""Kane And Abel"" and ""As the Crow Flies"". Sigh...He has certainly let us down this time"
4,An entertaining read,"I classified this Archer novel as ""fun"". A story of a lifelong battle between two newspaper tycoons, it is fast paced and entertaining. I enjoyed it immensely."
3,A Novel of Deception and Greed,The backdrop for this novel is the greed for power and money found in the world of mass media conglomerates. It seems the primary motivation of the characters is greed and a lust for more whether its power or prestige. I'm not convinced that this book makes anyone think any original thoughts. It seems to be a basic plot that was not that difficult to originate.
2,Bland,"This was not one of Archer's best. Being the third book I have read by him I was dissapointed. It was continuous storytelling. However, I did like the character contrast especially in their upbringing, and the fact that they came to act in virtually the same manner--all for the sake of money. However, the fact that one action had an equal and opposite reaction got old fast."
3,I was disappointed,"I have read everything written by Jeffrey Archer, and have never felt so unexcited when reading one of his books. Although it was a decent story, it just seemed like it was going nowhere, and when I finished it, I was relieved. I hope his next effort is much better."
4,A good story from a great story teller.,"Although not one of Mr. Archer's best, I still thought it was a very good book. I would certainly recommend it for all readers, weather you are an Archer fan or not. I thought the ending was good (it was a typical Archer twist)."
4,"Famous last words: ""I could never enjoy a story like that!""","Amazing how a story with absolutely vile, immoral protagonists; a plot that both adds to and takes away the glamour of the newspaper universe; & certainly nothing that you can really indentify with; takes hold of you, plunges you into its scheming, sordid world & changes forever the way you'll look at a newspaper again!!Bina MathewsDubai, U. A. E"
2,Unimaginative entrepreneurial epic,"Expecting an entrepreneurial tour along the lines of James Clavell's classic Nobel House, instead I found this book to be trite, loosely written, and unimaginative. While possessed with an engaging style which enabled me to power through over 700 pages, the novel portrays two unlikeable business titans in a way which leaves the reader with little to ponder (if only to use the book as a tool to repair their own business lives).The only really redeeming information is a side primer on how a book becomes a New York Times Bestseller: there is a secret list of 15 monitored book stores. This must somehow explain how this novel made the list"
3,Heard the taped version of THE FOURTH ESTATE.,"THE FOURTH ESTATE by Jeffrey Archer (author of KANE & ABEL, one of my favorite novels of all time) . . .this tale again involves two men . . . though from different backgrounds, they stand face-to-face in an attempt to beat each other and control the biggest media empire in the world . . . I was interested in the storiesof their respective childhoods; by the time they reached middle age, however, I had lost interest in what happened to either of them . . . the ending also did little for me."
3,"Good, but not great","I've read Kane & Abel, The Prodical Daughter, and Matter of Honor. All three of these kept me on the edge of my seat. This one didn't. It was good, but not one of Jeffrey Archer's best, in my opinion."
2,Brainless and predictable,"This was engaging enough to keep me reading the entire LENGTHY book, but that is the best I can say for it. It is a good premise, but after awhile, it is hard to care about either of the two main characters. Plus, the story gets so redundant that I kept reading, waiting for the amazing plot twists. Didn't happen."
2,Too long and too repetitive,"I really thought this book was going to put me to sleep, but I saved some money on nydol. The topics were repeated and boring."
3,"Finished it, but so what?","I keep expecting Archer's latest books to measure up to the earlier ones, but was disappointed again. Even though the chapters alternate so that one media mogul has every other chapter, I had to keep checking back to remember who was who. I didn't get to like--or hate--either one because I had a hard time really understanding them. The other characters were basically non-existent. I kept reading because the paperback was easy to carry and I knew from the beginning that only one would ""triumph"" in the end. Oh well, it was better than another Archer that I had to put down after a couple of chapters"
2,Unlikeable men battle for news empire,"Yawn. A tedious tale from the master of the formula novel. Both the central characters are ruthless, charmless men, with whom it is very difficult to relate or empathise. After a short time I stopped caring who came out on top, because both were so despicable.This novel has many similarities to Kane and Able, but lacks the human element of that work."
4,Media Moguals - The Dark Side,"Some reviewers state there is no heros in this book - it's about the least objectionable person. They are right. It's thinly disguested Maxwell and Murdoch. It's no wonder they sued to stop publicication of the work.Each character has their share of sleeze. Both were willing to do whatever it took to come out on top. But neither had the good sense to recognize when they should let it go... and let the other ruin each other.Indeed, ask yourself before the end - which man deserves to triumph. The best of them, the worst of them, neither, or just one of them. The answer might not be what you think."
4,Good novel,I have enjoyed the entrepreneurship of the players and the battle between 2 ego's. I can recommend this novel fullheartedly
5,It is wonderful. What is not to like about Jeffrey Archer's work! Haven't ever read a book I haven't enyoyed.,"It is wonderful. What is not to like about Jeffrey Archer's work! Haven't ever read a book I haven't enyoyed; and I have read them all. His writing is constant and stories always thoughtfully written, keeping you wanting more. How much better does it get than that."
1,Not for sensitive children - screen it (I didn't).,"Just came from comforting my sweet 8-yr-old, who was playing with this coloring book earlier in the day. She was crying, frightened, in bed, because the story had scared her. I confess I hadn't read it, but since it came home from her Catholic school, I assumed it was okay. It's a frightening, violent story, especially for a little girl. There is time to deal with the explicit stuff (torture, a lance through the base of her skull, etc) when children are older and better able to understand. I am certain our Lord does not want children frightened in this way. We can stick to the uplifting stories until they're past the age of coloring books, I think."
2,Disappointed,"Not what I was expecting; I thought the music would be very mellow, but it sounded more like a movie soundtrack with a few bird trills and crickets thrown in. The nature sounds were fine, but the music selection didn't blend with it at all. I was very disappointed."
2,"Cuts well, but the braising is really poor","The quality of the braising in the manufacture of this bit is very disappointing. I've posted a picture so you can see what I'm talking about. The bubbles, roughness and voids in the braising is what I expect to see in a low- cost Chinese bit, not one manufactured by CMT.I wrote CMT USA about this, but have yet to get a reply...also not what I expect from a tier 1 company.I need to add that this bit is cutting HDPE beautifully, but it better...HDPE is a very soft plastic.Incidentally, I need to add that the picture is incorrect. As the description says, this has a 1/2"" shank. The picture shows a 1/4"" one."
4,Nice but it came a little damaged,"It is nice but it came a little damaged. I never thought about returning it, but it now seems that needs to be replaced. It is easy to clean and looks so nice, the only thing is that if you put a heavy furniture on it as my table, it can actually damage the rug, not immediately but over the time."
5,Great for kitchens,"A bamboo rug is a wonderful choice for kitchens in high-traffic, sink, and stove areas. The foam backing cushions your back as you work, and the easily-cleaned bamboo takes the abuse of spattered water and grease instead of your hardwood (or other material) flooring. I love this product. I wouldn't put furniture on it, though, as one reviewer did. It doesn't seem designed for putting under tables and chairs. It's designed for walking on!"
3,"Not bad, but a bit deceptive album title.","This album is pretty good and easy to listen to, but if you're looking for Patsy Cline's greatest hits, this is NOT it. Not sure what ""Greatest Recordings"" is supposed to mean, but I'd never heard of most of these songs, but they're still good Patsy Cline tunes."
3,"A jack of all trades, a master of none","This book is a survey of other people's work, it doesn't go into depth and there are no implementations even for the purpose of illustration. The authors cover a lot of ground but they are just collating research done by other people for you. I am amazed that they believe that this is a $150 book.The subject matter is interesting to me so I will give it 3 stars, but if I had been able to look at it in a book store I would have never paid $150 or even $75 for it."
4,detractors are dead wrong,"the only reason i gave it 4 stars was due to inconsequential feature lacking. otherwise 5 star all the way. yes manual is difficult but with patience completely understandable. this is the first review i've ever written & really the only reason i'm writing it is to correct the misconceptions and to stop people from being scared off of this machine due to misinformation. first of all finalize. secondly,and this is the real reason i'm writing,all brands of 4x,sony's 1-8x, and in response to an earlier review my memorex 8x work perfectly. 4x is very hard to find now so i've been buying the 8x at first shyly now with confidence.i use sony 1-8x,verbatim 4x,tdk 4x,memorex 4x, and now memorex 8xwhich ABSOLOUTELY WORKS. buy with confidence. by the way have had this machine for quite a while and have dubbed & recorded 40+ discs so far."
3,All I can say is it's ok,Would I buy this again no and customer service is my major problem. Always a 30 minute wait time with the panasonic call # recieved with the product. I need to add that the vcr recording when playing back is of the poorest quality. I need to play with the tracking over and over.
3,Warning: Panasonic service is horrible!,"I received this item as a gift for Christmas, began hooking it up shortly after. Turned it on, and got an error message - something about 'can't read the disc', even though I hadn't gotten past the point of pressing the power button. Now I realize that the few days after Christmas must be the busiest time for customer service, but the Panasonic help line left the message 'live help is not available, please send an email'. I sent an email, got a response a week later - send the unit in for repair! They would not simply replace the unit with another brand new one, they made me bring it to a Panasonic repair center. I'm sure it's a great unit, if you get a working one. Beware."
4,Not a techie but LOVE this machine!!,"This machine has changed our TV viewing lives! Being able to watch a previously recorded show while recording one on a different channel at the same time is awesome. Not having to wait to start watching something until it is done being recorded is even better.The only down side was the owner's manual which is probably the most illogical document I have ever laid my hands on. The machine is flawless and easy to operate. The dubbing works very well and very easily...all in all, one of my best purchases in a long time!"
1,"Please, please don't waste your money on this piece of crap","Be aware that if you wish to dub a VHS tape to DVD, unless the tape was originally recorded by the Panasonic unit, YOU WILL EXPERIENCE FLUTTER/EXTREME TRACKING PROBLEMS!! 90% of my DVD's look like crap because the VCR in this unit is cheaply produced and trying to resolve tracking problems only results in frustration. So, if you like to watch your DVD's flutter, go ahead and spend $400+ on this Panasonic trash."
1,DVD recorder,the item is a very good item. I own three of them. this product that was ship to me was broken. The VHS part did not work and it was in terrible condition.
2,"Great functionality, sloppy build","I previously rated this player as 5 star. After 2 years, Ive dropped it down to 2. 6 months ago, the DVD player portion stopped working, it simply wouldn't play. After numerous calls I sent it off to panasonic for repairs, $130 and took 4 weeks. The until worked for about 5 months, then the eject button on the dvd player stopped working. Cant get it to open no matter what, so essentially it is now a $500 hard drive/VHS. Panasonic only has a 30 day warranty on repairs, which is ridiculous as Im sure they are using refurbished parts anyways. Not sure what to do now, as this think will have cost me $800 in the end if I repair it again. This machine has everything you need in one, but what good is it it wont work after 2 years. Look elsewhere."
2,"A GOOD ITEM FOR ABOUT A YEAR, THEN IT BECOMES A SURPRISE PACKAGE","This panasonic DMR-E75S is a nice item, but beware it may only last for about a year before it turns out to be a surprise package and the owner's manual booklet can be better too. I also must alert you that the customer care center by phone sucks just like a straw, nothing like a recording telling you that the waiting time for your call to get answer is about 55 minutes and will be answer in the order it came in and all that BS. Give it a year or so then it becomes a surprise package."
4,DVD-Rs must be finalized,"I just purchased this DVD/VCR recorder yesterday from Circuit City, spent several hours and ruined one VHS tape and one DVD-R trying to figure out the one touch dubbing process. I finally made a DVD that played back in this machine, tried it in my other two DVD players and couldn't make it work. I called Circuit City; the helpful salesperson went over the directions in the manual with me, and I realized I hadn't finalized the DVD-R. I did that, and now the DVD works in my other DVD players. The reviewer who was frustrated because the DVDs didn't work in his other DVD players did not follow directions, which specifically state that the DVD-R must be finalized in order to play in other DVD players. I think this machine is going to be just what I need for transferring family videos to DVDs."
4,A funny new book by a good author,"Mr. Chickee knows what he is doing when he gives Steven a bill that has fifteen zeroes, and the picture of the Hardest Working Man in Show Business, James Brown, on it. Steven's the perfect choice due to his being the President of the Future Detectives of Flint club and the second smartest kid at his school. When Steven starts to investigate whether this bill is real or not he quickly runs up against Agent Fondoo of the US Department of the Treasury, who is determined to get the bill back, one way or another.This implausible book, while keeping the setting of Flint with a black main character, is a departure from Curtis's other novels. Serious messages are out and humor is the focus of this mystery. Clearly intended to be the first of a series, those looking for a funny mystery, or just a plain funny book, will be pleased with this book."
3,Fun Reading Funny Money,"""Mr. Chickee's Funny Money"" was very slow in the beginning. However once the story started moving, it was fun to read. Actually, I had bought this book for my granddaughter, but after I reading it, I decided it was a good book for a boy."
2,The glory days have passed.,"This album was not what I was expecting. This band has changed a lot since Kiss The Goat, Enter The Moonlight Gate, and the Unholy Crusade. Their style is closer to Death Metal than black metal now and it is rather boring. They have developped a strange obsession with fingerpicking generic and broing melodies. Listen for yourself, every song on the starts with fingerpicking. There are no blistering black metal riffs and very few blast beats can be heard on the cd. What happened to the Lord Belial that created the masterpiece Enter The Moonlight Gate?"
1,The weak link in the trilogy,"There are three classic Topper films from the golden age of movies. The first, with Cary Grant, is a winner. The third, with Joan Blondell, is even better. But Topper Takes A Trip, the second in the series, is a complete dud. The script is simply embarrassing and wholly unfunny. The scenes (e.g. the bartender and the dog)are often pathetic. It took some doing to make a flop with the likes of the stars in this film. Even Franklin Pangborn is awful. But reading lines like that, how could he be otherwise? Best forgotten."
5,greatfamilyfilm,it would do all of us good if more movies were being made today that can make us laugh just by it being funny not by it being an effort to hurt or humiliate a person place or thing. maybe someone someday will look again at these old classics and see how refreshing it was to be entertained not by seeing people or places blowing up or being destroyd but just being allowed to sit back relax and enjoy the fact that what your watching can entertain you your grandmother and your kids all at the same time.
5,"If your house is for sale, buy this book","I did and I made $66k MORE than I thought I would. I did everything I possibly could right down to how I folded my towels and sheets in the closets and decorating, that's right, decorating my outdated pantry to look quaint instead of old. My family said ""we can't live like this"" and I told them this isn't for living, this is for marketing! My husband was unemployed and I am a housewife so the only way I could generate income for my family was by maximizing my profit from my home. I did, with this book."
5,....,"The first thing that struck me after reading this was that the description on the back didn't even begin to do it justice. The story is spellbinding, but it's Patricia McKillip's writing that makes the Riddlemaster trilogy one of the most beautiful set of books I have ever read."
5,Classic Fantasy by a Master,"There is something magical about the Riddlemaster books. I read all three books in three days, recently, after having read them when I was younger, almost 15 years ago. They are akin to Le Guin's Earthsea books or C.S. Lewis' Narnia tomes. True, the prose is a bit flowery and the descriptions of ""land law"" get tiresome and confusing, but those are minor quibbles. The ability to fully flesh out a world in under 300 pages, for one book, is amazing. A great series! Not ponderous and stilted like Jordan or Goodkind. Simple and elegant are all I can say."
2,Why re-issue when you could re-edit,"Here's what I wrote in Goodreads in May 2011:Finally finished the book which is a reprint of McKillip's first fantasy books. It was hard to read more than 2 pages at a time; I didn't care about the characters; I had problems whenever there was dialogue because she made it hard to know who was speaking and the book needed to be edited down to 2/3 of its original length removing some of the sturm und drang.I've been told that McKillip got better as a writer after she finished these 3, but it'll be a long time before I pick up one of her later books. She should never have re-issued this volume without extensive editing."
3,Great Characters Left Adrift in Too Many Words,"I love fantasy novels, especially when I can look forward to a series of stories in which I can follow strong characters who I care about. The Riddle Master trilogy had some wonderfully drawn characters, but that's about it. The plot was confusing and vague, with the majority of the ""action"" happening within the protagonist's mind. Dialogue was hard to come by, and I often found myself re-reading passages to be clear about who was speaking, and to whom they spoke. Additionally, the long and loving descriptions of the air, the earth, and the feelings of the characters could have been reduced enough to make one long novel - with 3 acts. The essence of a good story is there, but it is so hard to find!I'd give this 2 stars if I didn't know this was McKillip's first series, and hope that her future books grow from this point."
2,Had to put it down,"It just didn't make much sense. None of the characters captured my interest. I found them to be shallow, confused and confusing. I didn't get a real feel for them or their world. I finally gave up a third of the way through the final book in the trilogy. It's not the worst book I've read, but I would not recommend it as good reading."
4,I can't believe I forgot about reading this!,"I loaned my set out a few years ago and just now realized that I didn't have them! This is one of the best set stories that I have ever read, and I gone through them all. Well, a lot of them. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is I haven't read a perfect book. These, however, are just sweet reading. Do yourself a favor get it now."
5,Hauntingly Enchanted,"Never, in all my vast readings of fantasy, have a read a tale that left me so spell bound, so haunted, so enchanted. When I closed the book, finished, it was painful to leave the rich, beautiful world of riddles and mysterious harpists McKillip creates in the Riddle-Master trilogy. Her lyrical writing and deep, often heartbreaking, characters along with the depth and mystery of the plot create a lush world I once thought could only exist in my dreams. It was hard to leave it at the end because I wanted to live there, in that beauty. I love this book more than anything I have ever read and I recommend it to anybody who loves to read, especially to those who often feel misplaced in this world of reality."
2,Nonsense,"I've been a fantasy fan ever since the Hobbit came out in the US. I've tried the first 60 pages of this trilogy and found it confusing and baseless. She may be a great fan of Tolkien but just compare the first 60 pages of the Hobbit to this confusing work and you'll see the incredible difference. I just couldn't get interested in the characters and thought at age 71, why waste my time."
5,What a 14-year-old Thought About the Book,"After reading any Harry Potter, there's a let down, because you know whatever you read next won't ensnare you as much. But, these books actually are interesting enough to keep you interesting for all 592 pages. Although they are slightly confusing in the begining, they eventually make a great deal of sense and are a very enjoyable read."
5,Don't read this once -- read it over and over!,"What a strange, glorious story! Memorable characters, beautiful writing, and artful plot twists--nothing is quite what it appears to be! McKillip is a real wizard, and this is her masterpiece, as engrossing as it is odd. Celtic folklore enthusiasts should particularly relish touches like the Great Shout."
5,"A powerful book - ""Beyond logic, beyond reason, beyond hope""","I know others have commented on the wonderful characterization of Morgon, Raederle and Deth, but I can't help repeating it. Patricia A. McKillip creates the most amazing struggle inside and out of Morgon - the conflict between life as a farmer and a mysterious destiny, and his confusion over who to trust. As soon as I finished the trilogy the first time, I went back to reread it all the way through. Currently, I'm working through it yet again. There's too much in it to be captured in one reading. McKillip snags you with the first sentence and keeps you guessing until the very last word, but it is well worth the wait. Watching Morgon and Raederle grow to accept their powers and destiny, aching to return to the lives they lose is heart-wrenching and beautiful. This is a must read."
1,There's better ways to reveal Maui.,"I think this book misleads people about the safety of the trips, The directions to get to these trips, and plus there is better places to go. Every place you go with this book there are 100 other tourists heavily impacting the natural resources. If the activities made sure people did not tresspass, had safe hiking trails. and respected the cultural resources. then maybe but it has no regard for local culture, to reveal Maui just ask a local. They have the most revealing insight to the islands, Locals will not send you hiking thru burial grounds, tresspassing on private property, or not get you hurt.If you really reveal Maui you find inside it's rich respectful culture, not it's tour books."
1,You don't need this book!,"The spots in this book are crowded and trashed because of this book. You don't need a book the find Hawai'i's hidden treasures. Finding beautiful, peaceful, wonderful places is easy, and that is the best way to reveal the islands without ruining them. : )"
1,Misleading and Dangerous,"Maui Revealed will take you to all the unknown spots on Maui - The trouble is, they are often on private property. Spots that do not have the proper facilities for tourist enjoyment. Trails aren't maintained or are eroding. It seems like every few weeks a tourist gets injured at a ""Maui Revealed"" site and has to be medivac'd to a hospital. Don't let this book spoil your vacation."
2,flawed,"Generally a very good resource, we stayed in a small lodging that received a favorable review. The beds had previously used sheets and some areas clearly hadn't been dusted in at least a month and maybe more."
1,This author does not do enough research,I know for a fact that this author does not do all his research on companies that he writes about. I also know because I am a resident of Maui that he unfairly criticizes and praises companies that he himself at times has not personally toured with. I believe in some cases he just makes things up.He has however managed to disclose some of Hawaii's secret places that only the locals knew about! I need to tell you the locals are not happy about it. He also at times directs you to private lands that you should not be trespassing on.He has made a lot of people angry in Hawaii.Many of you like this book. Please be careful if you use it. I may get you in trouble and steer you in the wrong places or with the wrong companies.
4,Quirky but quite useful,"I hadn't done any research on what to see in Maui, so I bought this book the day I left. It proved invaluable in finding wonderful sights, activities and restaurants, it's a humorous, enjoyable read, and it's well organized. I used it every day and was very satisfied with it!Drawbacks:*The author puts so much of his personality into the writing, you may feel like he's on vacation with you.*Some reviews seem subjective--things that didn't impress the author did please me, and vice versa.*Park rangers at Haleakala saw the book in my hands and said ""Please don't use that while in the park."" They said the author ""refused to correct misinformation about the park."" But none of this hampered my enjoyment of Haleakala--or Maui!"
4,Wouldn't have been the same without it,"My husband and I ventured to Maui in May 06'. We stayed at a time share condo. The owners had quite a lot of books to look at, all about Maui. This one in particular was very very helpful. We used it most when we went up the road to Hana. We stopped and saw some incredible sights and went swimming in heavenly pools, got some amazing shots of waterfalls. It guided us step by step where to go and what to look for. It was great. When we got back home I ordered this copy as a treasure and keepsake of our Magical time in Maui."
3,Could be better,"The content is good, and it is nice to have the book on my phone. Much easier to carry with me than the book. However, you cannot zoom in on the maps, so they are useless on a smart phone."
5,Must have for Maui travelers,"This book is SO helpful in helping you find where to go, what to do, where to eat, stay, etc. Start reading it NOW, before your trip... then bring it along to guide you along the way. Great maps. Great tips. Loved it!"
4,"Good book, very helpful, BUT...","that is part of the problem. As other reviewers have noted, the author does too good a job and obviously has ticked off the locals. For example, on the road to Hana, the author notes all these places to go see waterfalls, etc. and uses mile markers to tell you where they are. Unfortunately, most mile markers are now missing, and it's hard to keep your eyes on your odometer and count while driving that road! We still enjoyed the drive immensely, but everywhere you think about stopping, you see tons of ""private property"", ""no trespassing"", and ""KEEP OUT"" signs.His review of a Mexican restaurant in Kahului was suspect, as the burritos were cheap, yes, but not very good at all.Overall we found the book helpful in planning our trip."
3,Beautiful photos. Poor restaurant guides.,"I took both Maui Revealed (MR) and Frommer's Maui 2010 to Maui this month, and liked Frommers more. Both were good books in general.MR is a beautiful book! The pages are glossy and thick with beautiful pictures. The narrative is funny and amusing to read. But it's hard to reference in a hurry because the details are lost in large paragraphs of jokes and historical background. MR failed to point out that one of the waterfall hikes on the drive to Hana would require trespassing, a fact that was pointed out in Frommer's. Though MR was good to discuss how some trespassing signs by EMI can be ignored.Restaurant recommendations in MR are awful. It lists commonplace burger and pizza joints, even a Pizza Hut. From Frommer's on the other hand, I got great restaurant recommendations on varying price ranges & local BBQ joints (e.g. Aloha Mixed Plate in Lahaina).In short, MR is good as a supplement, but not as your only guide book in Maui. I'd recommend Frommer's Maui."
2,Prejudice,Writers have prejudice against Maalaea Bay area. Reading the description of that area you think that every day is cane field ashes and high winds. The Trade Winds vary in strength and we are blessed with natural air conditioning.The cane fields in Kihei and other locales are burned as needed very early in the morning. Varying amounts of ash floats on the winds. No burning in the care fields next to Maalaea Village.
5,Highly valuable guide to Maui,"This guide proved very useful. It provided very detailed and informative suggestions, with a welcome sense of humor. In particular, we found the guides for the Road to Hana and for driving around West Maui terrific, and the advice was dead on. Some idea of how much it has become ""the"" guide for Maui is revealed by a sign we saw at a store they recommended. The sign referred to the page number in the book - didn't mention the book by name, just gave a page number - and, sure enough, it was for this book."
5,Awesome Maui,"Once we knew we were heading to Maui a friend of mine recommend Maui Revealed and and I glad I took her up on it. The book does reveal alot where to stay, eat, play, drive. Very comprehensive coverage and their website is a great addition to the book. I would highly recommend to anyone traveling to any of the Hawaiian Islands to get the corresponding book as well."
5,book,this was perfect for our trip to maui up an comming. Cant wait to try it out to see if all is true.
5,Absolutely the BEST!!!!!,"My husband and I traveled to Maui and this book was recommended to us by a friend. This is absolutely the BEST guide book EVER!!!! We've traveled quite a bit around the country and internationally, and this book by far is the most accurate guide book, also fun to read. It's also not pretentious and includes activities and restaurant recommendations on the budget. The author clearly knows Maui VERY WELL. We had such a great time in Maui and we owe it to this book!!! This is the only book you need when you travel to Maui."
4,MAUI TOUR,"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook (Maui Revealed)Excellent guide. Referred to it constantly while in Maui. Reviews of sites, restaurants, etc. are very frank, which was most helpful. I must say it is obvious that the author is not on any restaurant's payroll.Word of caution; we did find that points of interest were not as well marked ( if at all) as normally found on the mainland. This was particularly true on the road to Hana. The mile markers noted were helpful, but it was still easy to drive on by the destination. The drive, while tiring, was worth the time. The fresh banana bread sold along the way was worth the trip."
5,This is an ultimate guiodebook!,"Maui revealed is excellent! If you take only one guidebook with you, make it this one. They do get you off the beaten track and so you see a different Maui! Highly recommended."
5,Great Help!,This book was very helpful in finding the best of everything and pointing out great hikes and great secluded beaches. This was a valuable tool and I would be willing to buy it again at double the price!
4,"Maui, do it the right way!","This book is a great travel companion for a trip to Maui. The places, eateries, and activities are right on track. I own an Ultimate Guidebook for every island that I have visited and would not go without one! This guide will save you valuable vacation hours trying to figure out which activities or beaches are worth your time! I highly recommend this book to anyone planning that vacation to Maui! Mahalo!"
3,"Book OK, except it was sent damaged.","The book itself as a resource for information appears to be good so far. However, the edge of the cover of the book arrived damaged. The damage either occured prior to it being sent, or during packaging."
4,Vacation,My vacation was great because I was able to use this book to look things up. My only regret was not having enough time to see everything the author pointed out.
5,Maui Revealed - Reveals a lot of good stuff,I found this book to be up to date and an excellent resource for planning my trip to Maui this spring (2011). The author has a website that lists any changes since the Edition 5 of the book went to publication. The book was recommended to me by a woman who grew up in Hawai'i and visits Maui regularly. She thinks it is 'The Ultimate Guidebook' on Maui. I guess I will have a better idea in another two weeks after I have spent a week there.
4,Good guidebook,"I certainly would suggest purchasing this book BEFORE booking your trip! It would be better to waste a few dollars on a cheap book, rather than waste a lot of dollars on an overpriced vacation."
5,Highly Recommend!,This resource was recommended by a local from Maui & she was absolutely correct! This book provides great tips for a successful trip to Maui. A must read for anyone visiting or living on this Island!
5,This is the one,"In my opinion, this is the best of the best. A well laid out guide book, with lots of good iinformation."
5,must have before going to Maui,"This book is a must have for anyone visiting Maui. Hidden trails, beaches and reviews on local companies, restaurants were excellent. It's like having a local guide with you on your trip. I feel like i didn't miss out on anything Maui had to offer."
4,Best trip ever!,"This book helped plan a dream-come-true week in Hawaii for our family. We planned several mornings of scuba diving, snorkeling, and kayaking, based on the book's recommendations. We ate at several recommended restaurants, including the Aloha Mixed Plate. Yum! We rode horses for 6 hours to the crater of Haleakala volcano (and back), and drove the full day road trip to Hana. We experienced an authentic Hawaiian luau and the Ulalena show. Fantastic! Finally, we toured the Maui Gold pineapple farm and ate lunch at The Hali'imaile General Store. By the end of the week, we needed a vacation! Great reviews and recommendations. Is it any wonder this book was being sold as THE guidebook to Maui in the on-island stores? This book is BIG on activities on Maui, so you may want to consult other guidebooks for food and lodging recommendations."
5,Would not go to Maui with out this book,"Just like the Oahu book, I highly recommend this guide for anyone going to Maui. I read it cover-to-cover before we left and took it along to reference often. Great to find some lesser known places and to know which places to skip. I wish this author would review everywhere I travel."
3,lots of info some doesn't match,"this book is full of info about every inch of Maui. alot of it is mere fluff. the info may be accurate as to location of stuff, but the language used to describe what is there is way over blown-especially the road to Hana section."
5,Best of All,We have been to Hawaii 6 times. Mostly stay on Maui for 5 days and than to another island for 5 days. I have bought every guide book that is sold for Maui and this is the best. Everything in it is accurate. Especially the self guided tours. Shows you exactly where to stop and what to see. The humor is also very enlightening.
5,Great Book,"This is the guide I used for my trips to Maui, without a doubt the best book. I have used it for two trips and will be using it for a 3rd next year. When I first went to Maui, I bought this book along with the Frommers book, both were nice, but Maui Revealed was much better with details. Had better pictures, and the way it guides you around Hana Highway is very tough to beat. Highly recommend this book for the Maui traveler."
5,Don't go to Maui without it!,"This book is a lifesaver when traveling in Maui. We used it daily and found it so helpful in making decisions and visiting locations. It's written so well and is almost like talking to a friend about the best places to see on the island. I also highly recommend the book about Kauai by the same author. I believe it's called ""The Ultimate Kauai."" You MUST have it if you plan on visiting!"
2,Out of date,"Was not clear that the edition I was purchasing was the third edition and the book is now up to the 5th edition. Although I am sure the latest edition would have been fine, much of the book is out of date. Yes buyer beware, but it should be clear that the edition being sold is an older edition."
5,"more like ""5 stars ++""____Click ""ADD TO CART""","Very informative book. It made our trip to Oahu/Maui better than if I had tried to do it all myself. Much, MUCH information in these ""island"" Revealed books such as places to snorkel that aren't listed in travel guides and unbiased reviews on hotels, resturants, etc. If you're going to Hawaii you can afford the $12 cost of this book; it'll pay for itself many times over.5 stars ++"
3,be careful,"this book has gotten many a traveler in big trouble. The authors encourage visitors to walk on private property and not to worry about it. Trust me, the locals don't read this book and no hotel or B&B on maui carries it.Please be midful you are a guest on the island you may think it is just another state in our union, but there are many locals who would prefere you stay off of their island entirely. People have gone missing so be aware all that is wriiten here is not gold!"
4,good for getting around the first time,Great information on places to stop and places to skip. Rental car cautions are a bit outdated. We were able to drive on pavement almost everywhere went and the car rules had no restrictions.
5,Maui Revealed:The Ultimate Guidebook,A great guidebook. Just used this book last week on my trip to Hawaii....
2,Take with a grain of salt,Just returned from Maui. Many items are accurate but the book has some major misses as far as restaurant and entertainment recommendations. Use care.
3,good information but not gospel,"Just returned from a week on Maui and 5 days on Kauai - used these books for both islands. We enjoyed several restaurants on both islands that the authors panned; found several of their ""real gems"" to be unpleasant experiences; snorkeled on beaches they didn't like and just loved them!; and in general found the books to be useful but not the final word."
1,Maui Reviled,"This book has no respect for anything but itself. For example, it sends people across a huge lava flow to get to a secluded reef. That reef is a lively snorkel spot, but so are others that don't imperil the tourists, or put them in a position to leave trash in a pristine area & otherwise trash the place. This is a pattern. People on Maui call this book Maui Reviled. Other editions revile other islands. It's a very negative influence."
1,"""Children"" should be taught to respect others","Saw book in condo. We are long time Maui visitors (1965). Would not buy this book and have heard nothing but negative things about it. The authors showed a complete lack of respect to Hawaiians by advising visitors of places only known to the local people. There are plenty of wonderful places to go in Maui without invading other people places, many of them private.Much of their land has been taken and they have been made to feel as if the island no longer belongs to them and then these authors expose places only known to them for all the world to find. Their attitude seems to be that everyone has a right to see all the places on the island. Well, we don't. We are guests on Maui and guests don't go through private things belonging to our hosts. The word I hear on Maui is shame on the author and don't buy this book... and we won't .... and we tell everyone we know not to buy it and why. There are plenty of other good, respectful guidebooks."
1,BEWARE***********************,"Amazon claims this item is ""In Stock"". After I ordered, the e-mail showed the book may take up to 3 weeks to ship.If you need the book in a reasonable time, Barnes and Noble ships within 24 hours.Obviously this has nothing to do with the quality of the book (which I re-ordered from B&N;) but thought this info might be helpful."
2,Maui Revealed,This book made our vacation so much better as it covered every inch of Maui. I cannot recommend it too highly.
4,maui revealed,Newest edition looks exactly like the older ones with identical pictures and captions. Some relevant new information makes the book worth buying.
5,Maui Revealed,Grreat travel companion book. Filled with information. Easy to read. Milage markers on maps. Reccommend for all travelers to Maui.
1,Surprisingly Awful,I didn't agree with all the positive feedback here. I expected a real thorough tour of Maui and got pages of tourist traps. Popular?? Fantasy pure fantasy. I think the Maui Revealed belongs in the fiction section.
3,"Good, but not ""the ULTIMATE""","I bought this book because I wanted more information than was offered in the Fodor'Fodor's Maui 2012: with Moloka'i and Lana'i (Full-color Travel Guide)book. While it did have some nice features, I'm not sure I trust it as much. One reviewer said that Maui Revealed wrote glowing reviews of absolutely everything... which I found to be the case.The information was organized in a different fashion than I was expecting. It may work fine for other readers, but I found it a bit cumbersome.It has reviews for dining, lodging, beaches & activities, but doesn't list much about kid-friendly travel.This is a nice book, but I am going to primarily use the Fodor's guide."
5,Great book.,All the inside scoop from people who live on Maui. Can't wait to get there and follow their suggestions on places to go.
5,Excellent,I've never had any other tourist guide like this (except the others Hawaii islands guides writtten by the same author). I found it really usefull in planning and during my hawaian vacation!
1,Kindle version don't bother,As far as I can tell the kindle version is worthless as a guide book. A guide requires you to find your way around. There are not any real features to search and find stuff.
4,No need for a tour guide,Don't go to Maui without it.It's give very practical tips in a fun way.We stayed at Maui Seaside Hotel. I'd give that 1.5-2 stars.
1,This is the crappiest hat I have ever bought!,I work outside 8 hours a day in the hot Florida sun. This hat is not worth anything. The brim is maybe an inch which gives ZERO protection! I guess if you have a bald head and are only looking to protect the top of your head from the sun this hat would work. I was looking for a hat that would allow airflow yet protect my face. This hat does NOT protect any part of your face when you wear it. A baseball cap would protect your face more than this thing would. Save your money and buy an Outdoor Research hat. It does cost more but you get what you pay for!
5,Very good,Good price.Timely delivery. Just like original and very easy to install.Search the internet for instructions on installation.Remove old valve.Clean up hole.Apply some oil or grease on new o ring.Install new valve and your good to go.It's also a good time to clean out air intake with some spray air intake cleaner.
4,Great Book!,"A little advanced for true beginners, I haven't gotten too far in it yet because I am actually learning from the beginning with ""How to Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs: A Step-by-Step Guide to Teach Yourself, Revised Edition"" (I know thats supposed to be underlined but I don't know if I can do that in this text box). I have a feeling this book will be an immense help when I learn enough to use it!"
4,a must for budge lovers...,The concise list of words to be learned by any serious student is worth the asking price of this book.
5,Must read,This is a must read for new agents and can help the old pro learn some new tricks. The straight forward advice is refreshing. Remley actually gives you real world examples and simple techniques to grow your business. It makes you appreciate the fact that each agent is responsible for growing their own business and Remley gives you a road to follow. He focuses on the actual business of real estate and not just a bunch of rehashed motivational techniques on setting goals.
3,Useable Tablecloth,Light-weight. Machine washable. Requires little ironing if pulled from the dryer immediately. Good everyday tablecloth.
1,This book is a waste of money,"I bought this book thinking that it would add some insight while planning my upcoming wedding. Boy, was I wrong! All the information could be found by searching the Internet. The layout is pretty lame, and it was hard for me to look things up without reading entire sections to find the information. I can't even justify giving it one star. Spend your money on a better book."
3,The Basics of China Painting,"A good book for beginners, but as the title says: Basics, not much on special techniques like dusting, grounding or luster."
1,this cd sucks why would anyone want to buy this shit,"I'm a huge eminem fan and I like all of his cds, but his greatest hits album just sucks, because he's not even singing any of the songs. One of them sound like a vanilla ice wanna be and that is bad. I wouldn't waste my money or time on buying this cd, if u want a mixed cd with all your favorite eminem songs on it burn the songs from the original cds and mix them onto another cd. ""DON'T BUY THIS CD, IT WILL BE A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!"""
1,Wouldn't work,"I threw this away and ordered the complete sprayer and hose unit because I could not get this product to attach without leaking.This job was actually one of the most awkward plumbing jobs I've done, although it's apparently simple. You don't wantundersink fittings to leak, but it's really awkward, without a proper (slightly more expensive) double union joint to tighten themeffectively. Even the hose+ sprayer unit leaked slightly at first (cheap union) but now it seems to have calc'd up and itdoesn't leak."
1,Don't Like At All,"Records will show I've boutht 3 of these clocks in last 6mo. I gave them away as presents, then my 88yr. old moms says you can't see the time during the day unless you punch a button, Then time will stay on only for 5 seconds. This was not refered to in details of clock when I bought them. It may work during the night but why would anyone build a clock that you have to go to and punch a button to see time during day. To say the least I CAN'T TELL YOU ENOUGH HOW NOT HAPPY, I AND EVERYONE ON MY GIFT LIST IS WITH THIS PIECE OF WORK !GEO"
1,Poorly engineered,The clock does not project out to a ceiling at about foot to waist level unless you turn it around backwards! Thus the clock face is not readable. The rotational adjustment doesnt allow you to rotate towards the middle of a ceiling or wall.Poor design as compared to other projection alarm clocks purchased in the past.
2,Skyscan clock,"Great price for this clock, BUT, have read the instructions and set the clock and it always (when wave happens)sets itself for one hour behind the original time. Have taken out batteries and unplugged the clock and re-set many times to no avail."
2,Hardly atomic,"Where to start. No warranty, no instructions. Would not set time automatically. Focus knob simply rotated; did not focus. Without instructions is difficult to set up. Worth maybe $10 for the projection, no more. Overall, cheap, cheap, cheap. Poor example for Lacrosse; will avoid them from now on. Very disappointed,"
1,equity time skyscan lcd atomic alarn clo0ck,"DOES NOT PREFORM AS ADVERTISED !! DOES NOT KEEP PROPER TIME AND THE ALARM THAT WE HAVE NEVER SET, WON'T STOP GOING OFF !!!I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING !!!MICHAEL PILIARIS"
3,Not what I ordered,"The one I received does not look like the one in the photo. I did not realize it until I came back online and looked at my order. The one I received is larger and square but works the same--the projection is what I was looking for. Unfortunately, the atomic part does not work in southern California. I had to call customer service and get it figured out and manually set the time. Customer service was helpful and nice."
5,I really like this more than I expected,"I have several SkyScans. Where I live, we lose power all-too-frequently. It works fine, has no problem getting the ""sky signal"" (we can't even use cell phones here) and I especially like the ""ceiling time' (it projects the time onto the ceiling). The only thing I had to get used to is the alarm setting mechanism. The in-between setting does not set the alarm, you have to slide it all the way....and the alarm has an increasingly louder signal, so you can't be slow at turning it off (unless loud noises don't bother you in the AM.) Mine looks just like the picture. It always has the right time and I don't have to mess with it. What could be better?"
2,Operated by battery only so lose ALL settings when change battery,"I tried the ""Equity by La Crosse SkyScan 31269 LCD Atomic Alarm Clock"" and it was fine except the clock ran from battery only even though they give you an ac adapter. The ac adapter is for the ceiling display only. When you change the battery on the La Crosse, the clock and ALL settings are lost so I returned it and bought the ""SmartSet Dual Alarm AM/FM Clock Radio"". The ceiling time can NOT shown right side up with the clock facing you, this is like most other ceiling clocks so watch out. The La Crosse has the most advanced ceiling display as it can be twisted all 4 directions, but cannot be twisted enough to use the clock with the ceiling display right side up."
5,Projection clock review,For the money this is a great product. The atomic part of this clock is excellent as you do not have to set it and the time is always correct.
1,Wacko clock,The clock will not set to eastern standard time. I manually set it and it keeps reseting itself to central time. The customer service on this product is horrible. A person called during the day and left me no good info.
2,2001 and illuminati in white house? Strange,"Eeerie... how did the author come up with this illuminati 2001 plot? Conspiracy theorist will drool over this read. I dont think much of it as a whole, but weird coincidences like this make me show everyone these fascinating details. Beyond that though this book is a waste of time when there is sooooo much more in the conspiracy theory genre. 2"
2,"Overexaggerated & unbelievable, but interesting.","An interesting plot, quite easy to read although very religious(directly describing the anti-christ, heaven/hell etc. - the author isobviously a devout christian) and somewhat too exaggerated and farfetched at times. The author certainly has a vivid imagination though - it is amazing (although thoroughly unbelievable) all the worldshaking events that he described happening in just the space of the next 10 years.The characters are interesting and well thought out, although the author has an annoying habit of giving ALL of the characters names, however important or unimportant they may be. This results in the reader reading half the book before he realises which characters are important and which are not.This book is however worth reading if you're interested in plots, conspiricies etc. Disappointingly, however, it does not tell you very much about the Illuminati."
2,You should still read this book,"There are several problems with this story that might prove to be a distraction (which caused me to give it two stars). It is supposedly updated to take into account technology advances since its publication in the 1990's. But they missed a bunch. Also the book lacks characters that are compelling either in their goodness or their evilness. There is no apparent main character until the last few chapters so the novel suffers from point of view issues. BUT all that being said, if you are curious about how a super elite might come to power in the US and how this matches up with end times Bible prophecy, there is still great value in reading the novel."
4,An exciting yet frightening picture of where our country may be heading,"While reading this book, I found myself asking what would I do if I were in the same position as the Christian characters.What I discovered was that I honestly had no idea what I would do, but I this book has really begun me thinking about that.I would recommend this book to anybody that enjoys reading fiction that makes them think."
2,"So bad, it's almost good","This book has it all -- economic disaster, a tsunami, a bad guy named Hussein, Christians and Jews vs. Arabs, nuclear bombs, oil shortages, rigged elections, conspiracies, secret societies, assassinations, riots, and a computer ""genius"" hero. The characters and the dialogue in this book make Dan Brown look like a literary genius. It's bad. However, the plot is so ridiculous that it's somewhat entertaining to read.I must give the author credit for one thing -- his imagination came up with all of this in 1991, before things like $150/barrel oil, terrorism, and major tsunamis became reality..... and, before Dan Brown's novels brought this literary junk to the mainstream."
2,"Great idea, terrible writing","The overall idea of this book gives you pause, especially when you consider all the things Burkett came up with that have actually come to pass. But what is with the junior-high writing? It seems that whenever any of his ""heroes"" is in a bind an implausible magic solution surfaces just in the nick of time."
3,Not his best work,"I found this book enjoyable reading but, it is not Larry's best work. The title is misleading, as it does not focus on the Illuminatti. It is, however, interesting how he takes his knowlege of finance and applies it to the story line. I found the characters believable and entertaining. I would recommend this to the christian reader, especially those interested in the endtimes. Obviously, those of other religious persuasions will not appreciate the biblical application. Overall, I think it is a pretty fair first effort at fiction."
1,"Foolish, Selfserving and Trite","It's disturbing to think that trees died so this could be printed...This is an incredibly weak novel, attempting to capitalize on the name ""Illuminati"". Horribly slanted from a right-wing, conservative, religious bias that is childlike in nature. The two-dimensional people in this 'novel' bounce around like puppets in a Punch and Judy show.....no, sorry, Punch and Judy's characters are more developed than that.Save your money to buy a sandwich, it will be more fulfilling both physically and intellectually."
2,action-packed but over-written; somewhat annoying.,The book was a fast read but I was annoyed with the way it was written. I didn't like the charactors of the computer whiz and his girl-friend; made you root for the bad-guys. I liked the plot. If somewhat interested in conspiracies and Illuminati purchase the book.
4,Very Real,"Most of the activity in this book is actually happening right now, but at a lesser scale. As you read the book, you will say to yourself, ""hey, this stuff is happening now!"" It keeps you reading from beginning to end without putting it down. I enjoyed it completely."
2,Ominously Hilarious,"Written at a middle-school level, this story is laugh-out-loud funny, until you realize how chillingly accurate it is at predicting the end of democracy. The author describes step by step the playbook our leaders followed to curtail freedom in America. The irony is Burkett got it backwards. That's right folks, it turns out The Illuminati are real. They're just not who the author thought they would be."
5,Couldn't put it down,"As a mother of six, I don't have much time to read, but I made the time for this one and I couldn't put it down. I'm not a religious fanatic, but there were enough elements of truth, that I can only hope and pray that we never come to what Larry Burkett suggests could happen."
2,Great idea poorly executed,"The central idea is wonderful: there are powers controlling the powers that we see. (Someone controls the president who controls the FBI etc.) Unfortunately after the being well set up in the first 1/4 - 1/3 of the book, the story degenerates into a lot of wild-eyed religious hand-wringing. Which is ironic because after the first part sets up the reader to think about manipulation and control, the heavy-handed remainder comes across as propoganda and causes the reader to wonder who is controlling the author. I would love to see other authors take the basic idea and craft something really sinister. This one, however, I would skip."
4,Can you see what would be?,"Perhaps the conspiracy buffs wouldn&#65533;t be so disappointed if the name of the book were &#65533;You asked for it, you got it&#65533;. As this book provides a truthful extrapolation of current events left unchecked by a people not willing to take stand against evil. The author isn&#65533;t &#65533;polished&#65533; in his writing style, but is very insightful in his understanding of human nature and social trends. The sequel &#65533;The Thor Conspiracy&#65533; is even better."
5,Looks great!!,Could not be happier!! It looks great and it very good quality. We love the Toddler bedding that we bought with it!
5,Love this valance,"This valance compliments my daughters nursery wonderfully. We have the Maya crib bedding set and matching valance and it looks wonderful! I washed the valance before hanging it up, let it air dry, then hung it up and it looks great!"
4,Really cute curtain!,"I ordered this curtain for my hall bathroom and needed something that was blue and yellow to go with my shower curtain. I just ordered from a picture on the amazon website. It was cuter than I thought, and looks great!"
5,Final touch...,This valance is great. It arrived on time and in good condition. Perfect final touch to her room!Thx so much!!!!-highly recommend
4,Would not order this set.,"I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly I received this from the shipper! Unfortunately, I did not love the pattern. There were a lot of white sections and it was really leafy. I was looking for something paisley with bright and pretty pinks and greens. The colors were pretty & I loved the stripes; you could match a lot with it. Those leafy sections just made it look cheap looking to me, especially the comforter. Although I am in the process of returning the entire set, I would order from this seller again. The seller made the returning part very easy and understood that I did not like the set once I saw it in person. I gave 4 stars because the seller was great but the item was not!"
4,Great price,Looked around for this piece at different stores and couldn't find it at the right price. Found it on Amazon with other like pieces for a great price. Item is just as pictures. Make sure to pay attention to the figures or shapes. They do make this the same color but with different shapes in the pattern.
5,Perfect for the room!,"I bought this matching crib set back in 2008 when I had my son. 2 years later, baby boy #2 arrives and we switch their rooms. My baby had darkening blinds in his room and I just needed a curtain vallance... I was SO HAPPY when searching Amazon that I found the matching Valance for a crib set that Target had put out 2 years prior.The material is wonderful and the brown tabs add a great touch!I love that Amazon has things that Department stores may no longer have or carry!It is perfect for his room"
4,Perfect for my nursery,"Nursery is now complete with these. Good quality and good length, at first I was worried I may have to order 2 for one window. But one per window is fine. Would recommend to a friend."
3,"Okay, but somewhat disappointing","The product arrived timely and was in good shape, but the quality wasn't as nice as I thought it would be. I felt the same way about the crib/bedding set, as well. I guess I should've shopped in person rather than ordering items like this online!"
1,Lousy at best,"1 star because one can't give a rating lower than that. The authors do a good job of repeating trivial stuff over and over again. But when it comes to algorithmic or mathematical treatment of the subject, they seem to be at their wit's end. Consider this : According to authors, 2^56 + 2^56 = 2^112. Basic mathematics knowledge would have been suffiecient to calculate the above i.e 2^56 + 2^56 = 2*2^56 = 2^57.I think now one can start judging the faith one can have in the authors and the book. The authors make it apparent in the first few chapters itself that one should not expect any sensible treatment of the topic. I would recommend this book to all those who have never experienced frustration in life and are looking for a first-hand experience."
2,Mediocre,"I was looking for a book to cover the JAAS API and kerberos with examples. Very little of the book addressed that. The book seems mostly to cover the theory, and in that light it rambles on and is confusing. If you're the type who buys lots of books, this one might serve to connect some dots. If you buy few books, I doubt this one will help."
1,Cut & Paste?,"This book has some of the same code from an earlier book title the ""Java Security Handbook"". Doesn't give me much comfort in the author's abilities."
2,Should have bought the metal one.,This is made from very cheap plastic. Nearly impossible to install without leaks. The plastic just deforms too easily. I should have bought the metal one.
4,Conserving water matters,"We have relatively high water presssure in our house, and even purchasing 5 GPM shower heads didn't satisfactorily limit the flow. This valve did. It also allows for my wife to turn on a higer flow when she wants more hot water. It's primarily plastic and could be constructed of stronger materials, but we have had it in service for several months with no problems."
1,I had a bad experience with this receiver,"I bought this and loved it for the price, I loved the Sirius service. I bought it for a road trip. On the third day of my trip, the receiver was crackling and my dashboard lights and dials started to go haywire, along with my cruise control. I pulled over to a rest area and then my car wouldn't start. I unplugged the receiver and then my car started and ran fine. I plugged in later when I was home and my airbag light and brake light went on. I called JVC and they didn't have any answers for me and then I returned it to best buy and am waiting for a refund minus a restocking fee. My other electronics work fine on my cigarette lighter, my phone and ipod. I don't know what the problem was."
1,II shoulda listened...,"This rig, along with t's home docking station, has to be the most single worst item I have ever purchachd here at Amazon.com.It only ran for one hour, and litteraly exploded. There is NO way I am paying for this."
1,Do not buy this receiver,"It went dead after only three months. The number I called for warranty repair/replacement kept redirecting me to repair centers all over the country.Finally, I got an answer--mail it to service center somewhere in Illinois (I pay the postage), and it will take four to six weeks to get a new receiver. Which means you will have to pay to have the new one activated, not knowing if it will fail in three months AGAIN, and...Anyway, you get the picture. Just trust me--don't buy it."
1,Signal drop-off common w/this unit,"Easy to use, but the signal keeps dropping out unexpectedly in both home/car use. If the unit is turned off and then turned on again, the signal often comes back for a few minutes. I will be looking into higher-end products."
4,"Good receiver, especially for the price I paid!","I bought this receiver one year ago @ Circuit City. It was one of those ""we found this sitting around in the stockroom, and it needs to be sold"" deals. For $50 I got the receiver, home kit, and car kit.In the year I have had this unit, it has worked well for me. It's been on as long as approx. 4 hours, and I haven't had issues with problems due to overheating. The unit sure does get hot, however!I especially like the large display this unit has; makes it easy to glance over and see what's playing, without having to take my eyes off the road.Sure, this isn't being made anymore, but if you can get a deal like I did, I would say go for it!"
3,keeps you on edge,"I just saw the movie, The Last Samari, and scenes in the movie could have been taken from this book. That's why I had to look this book up today, to see if it was based in Japan. I don't like books that are violent and keep you on the edge of your seat, but this one offered a personal touch that made me want to continue reading. Lots of action!"
5,Easy to understand,This book helped me to see the value of women in the eyes of God. Not just as a delicate flower but as a strong spiritual force in the body of Christ. This book is theologically sound and easy to understand. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in expaning their perception of God!
4,ISLAND WARRIORS (Carrier series),Plot is kinda lose needed to be tighten up a bit over all a fairly good read .. Wish I had read others back like 17 ect before reading this one..
5,Great Study Guide,"I used this book while pursuing my B.S. in Biochemistry and it is the best study guide I ever used. It covers all of the primary topics in undergraduate biochemistry and gives pertinent examples without extraneous information. I highly recommend it as a study aid, especially for standardized tests."
2,Small and insufficient.,"This book presents a small amount of elementary Finnish, and it suffers the ills of small courses: not enough explanation of grammar, not enough exercises, not enough reading, not enough sound recording. It is visually attractive--but is that enough?Finnish is a complex language with exacting pronunciation, complex grammar, and an extensive network of internal sound changes that must be explained clearly and completely. The student cannot assimilate these structures without reinforcement from exercises and readings. None of these elements are sufficiently provided in this book.Compare this poverty of resources with the very fine course by Meri Lehtinen (books and recordings published by Indiana University) and with the two second-best runners up, the Foreign Service Institute's Finnish course, also with book and recordings, and ""Finnish for Foreigners,"" (books and recordings) published in Finland but widely available in the English-speaking world."
2,totally misleading title,"I bought this book to learn some advance database programming specifically with Oracle which the book claims it does cover. However, what I found was a perl mysql programming book that has devoted half its contents to web site development (which I'm not interested in). I think this book should be renamed to ""website development using perl and mysql"". If you really just want to learn database programming using perl read ""programming DBI"""
3,Perl and MySQL database ... best for title.,"This book will be called Perl and MySQL database programming, the book comment say that this include access to many databases, including Oracle and PostgreSQL, when you read this, you can see that the only database that Brent use is MySQL. MySQL is good database but not the best, I prefer PostgreSQL over MySQL, and my book is now archived.Regards"
5,This guy can brilliantly tell a story,"Another masterpiece by Mr.Cauffiel.He has the ability to make me feel I was actually there watching this sick scene play itself out. How could king do this to the mother of his kids?!This guy is actually one of Cauffiel's oddest killer's yet.How did he think he could get away with it? How could he have actually ever become a cop?? Also included in this book are some good family photos,including some unintentionally hilarious pictures of killer king himself,obese and bald in a cheap looking plaid suit.What did these women see in this absolute moron?A MUST READ"
3,A thorough book but needs editing,"Caulfiel's look at the sensational murder of Battle Creek, Michigan anchor woman Diane King is extremely detailed and encompasses a wide range of issues. To Caulfiel's credit, he avoids overdramatizing events and putting a distinct spin on the story. This is a pitfall some true crime writers fall into but Caulfiel does not. He also paints a vivid picture of the small town atmosphere of Marshall, Michigan. The comments from King himself are also intriguing.My main complaint with this book is that it is far too long. Much of the more boring mintuae of the investigation is unnecessary and plodding to read. A lot of issues are rehashed several times. Also, very little detail is given about how King's children were faring with her family after the trial. That would have been time better spent.All in all, it's a good effort but could use some paring down."
2,"Interesting, but not terribly factual.","This is a very dramatic story, mostly because much of it is made up.Like another reviewer, I was a student of King's at the time all of this took place. There are so many inaccuracies in the book, I wouldn't have known it was supposed to be about King if his face weren't splashed across the cover (the version I read has a family portrait on the front cover).If you are looking for facts, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a decent book to pass the time, this will do the trick."
1,"Should be labeled ""Fiction""","I came across this book very recently. Although the actual events occured over 10 yrs ago, it still interested me.As the author presents it, this seems like a very dramatic, compelling story. Unfortunately, the truth exists and this is not it. I was a student of Brad King's at the time these events took place and very obviously, this rendition is off.The author should be ashamed that he wrote such a sensationalized account to sell books."
3,Decent Resource,This book is a good tool for counselors and people recovering from addiction. It does a good job of illustrating the symptoms of relapse and provides a basic outline of a plan for recovery. This book is more about the symptoms of withdrawal and relapse than it is about recovery. The author strongly urges the recovering person to seek help from groups like AA and to not go it alone in overcoming addiction.
5,For anyone who wants to stay sober,"While I was in Inpatient Rehab I was given this book to read. It is like a bible to me now. Everything you need to know about staying clean and sober is in this book. Along with AA, sponsors, numbers, support groups, this book gives you some soild tools to stay sober. I highly suggest it!"
3,Good shape and fast,I received the book fast and it was in good shape. Used however does mean used...writing and notes on the pages but a great value for what I needed.
3,Not bad,"One of several books of a series involving the murders at the Glensheen Mansion in Duluth, MN. We bought them because we were at that location and had a tour of the place."
5,"Very well written, lots of details you can't find elsewhere!","I loved this book. I thought the attention to detail was what was so spectacular about it. I grew up in Northern Minnesota and I loved hearing every little detail about a story that I have been around my whole life. Who wants to read a ""generalized"" account of a murder? True life murder investigations and accounts are very detailed, as they should be and this one is no exception. It was great getting all of the extra information that you don't hear about on TV or in the newspapers. I love non-fiction books and I think this one was truly interesting to read. I couldn't put it down even though I knew the ending! Very well written. I highly recommend it."
4,A FUN BOOK,"This book follows the rules of a Regency without being 'young girl goes to London for her Season and tames the rake.' Good read. The rescue on the beach that is the opening scene is very well done. . . and memorable. I looked for and read Kerstan's other books about Christopher's brothers. . .however, I think this one was the best."
1,Effort to Finish,"I loved Kit from Celia's Grand Passion so I had looked forward to reading his story. But this book was so bad that I had to make a real effort to finish it. Kit meets up with Lucy (who calls herself Luke as she was pretending to be a boy) on the beach on night while smuggling. He was shot and she helped him escape and bind his wound. Diana (who I am guessing will figure in the story with the last brother) is the only interesting person in this draggy story. Nice to see Celia and Kendal again and their baby. But the romance between Lucy and Kit was flat and had no spark. The mystery was flat, too. A good romance has to have wit, romance, spark and an interesting premise. All these were missing from the regency. A romance between Kit and Lucy was forced and did not seem real. The bad guys, if they are such, are also not interesting nor dangerous."
3,"Superseded premises--but good reading, anyway","Chas. McCarry's ""Shelley's Heart"" is driven by the then and now faintly quaint notion that an assassination of a terroristic head of state, ordered by a U.S. president is an objectionable act of murder that should and would be prosecuted by impeachment. Due to be reissued in May this year, ""Shelley's Heart"" is unlikely to overcome this fundamental oddity. Its simplistic fictional conflict between righteous conservatism and naive liberalism--it was published in 1995--is unnecessary to be updated--samo, samo. But its plot, involving the fictional second impeachment of a U.S. president, will need a substantial historical revision to account for the now-historical second impeachment of a U.S. president, Bill Clinton, later in the 1990s, after is was published. I might be curious enough to see how McCarry or his editors do it to browse it on the shelf, when it comes out."
2,The weakest of the series,"I love McCarry's books, especially Old Boys and The Miernick Dossier, but I found this one preposterous. The secret left wing society of the title was absurd, and the way new members kept cropping up made the book seem more like cranky gassings than a real, complex thriller.If you prefer your villians Snidely Whiplash with a pink tinge, and your heroes out of the Fox News anchor mold, this is for you. Otherwise, wait until you just need that one more helping of the otherwise excellent McCarry."
1,Horrible book. Right wing conspiracy nuts would not agree.,"The book is set in the near future, but there has been a lot of change. Hunters are no longer able to hunt, so Washington is overrun with deer. If that's plausable to you, then you might enjoy this dreadful book.McCarry did show some flair for writing. His Speaker of the House, a drunk with a photographic memory who quotes the bible, was a hoot. The lesbian, Slim and Sturdi, were about a multi dimentional as Ren and Stimpy.If McCarry keeps the conspiracy politics out of his writing, he may be an intertesting read. Until then, I suggest that you avoid him."
4,B+ for a B film,"Brett Piper is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you happen to share his off-beat nostalgic sense of irony, as I do, you'll generally enjoy his movies. He obviously has affection for the B sci-fi/horror movies of the 50s and 60s along with the contemporaneous TV shows such as the Outer Limits and the Twilight Zone. Start with a light-hearted homage to one or more of them (not a quite full-blown parody), toss in some modern sleaze and gore, and you've got the idea.Bite Me! has giant bloodsucking bugs, strippers, humor, violence, and a transmogrified DEA agent: plenty of ingredients for an evening of escapist fun. Misty Mundae, as is evident from other user reviews, has a dedicated cult following. This is not hard to understand. She is fetching and is more than able (in line with George Burns' definition of good acting) to remember her lines and not trip over the furniture. She, Julian Welles, and a few other of the cast are also reasons to like this film."
3,Was better than I expected,"Not too bad a movie with a lot of unknowns that I'm not familiar with. I heard about this since my son stars in the 1st 5 minutes and told me about it. I wasn't sure what to expect and it was kind of humorous and hard to compare this to the top notch movies I'm accustomed too. I guess on the level this movie is at, it rates up there with the best."
2,Big Disappointment,"This movie was pretty disappointing compared to previous Misty Mundae movies. I bought this knowing I'd be taking a risk on disappointment, and let's be honest, we don't buy these movies for a great story. This lacks most qualities I'm looking for in Misty Mundae's movies. I remember seeing Lord of the G-Strings and being a little more impressed, also one of the vampire movies was pretty good."
3,themeatnpotatoesofitall,"Goofy B-Movie,strippers,con men,exterminators and Oh yeh, how can we forget mutant blood sucking bugs(that's why I bought it),acting is average.. some actors more talented then others (more expierenced)the ladies are cute and ditzy, and I can't help feeling, thru out this whole movie, (including expierencing its C-effects no ""b"" here) I felt like I was watching a SID&MARTY CROFT FOR ADULTS..not an epic and was'nt meant to be.. good for budget movie makers lookin into cut corners and $$ when filming your own Horror or Sci-Fi movie..$cheap$ dvd..worth it, if your into the genre.. not for little ones.."
3,Not too bad....but not great,"This movie, is first a movie whose priorities is to burn time,with too much stripping and not enough creatures. Then there isparts with real stupid violence that should have not been in the film, and then we have our little spider creatures action that should have had priority in this film by the way of a better script.I gave 3 starts for the following: Production Value,creature effects...and of course the nudity."
4,"Hokey, but it's ONLY A MOVIE!!!","The DVD caught my eye in a local video store, so I picked it up. I wasn't expecting anything more than 90 minutes of escapist entertainment, and that's just what I got! This movie had some good scenes and some dumb ones, some cheap special effects, some bad lines and some silly sexual content. So did ""Return of the Jedi"", if you want to get technical. This isn't really even a horror movie. It's more like the old drive-in ""B"" movies that Elvira built her career on. I certainly wouldn't build a library out of movies of this quality, but there definitely is a certain amount of entertainment value. Consider this what it is, a well-done low budget movie, not a major studio blockbuster. Independent studio creativity doesn't always have to mean art films, after all!"
5,Sasquatch Mountain,Another one of those movies that are just enjoyable to watch and sit back to relax with a cup of tea. It does have a plot and I enjoy Lance Henriksen very much. Movie consists of bank robbers who get away from the police and escape into the woods. Unfortunately they run into some very bad Sasquatches and slowly get killed while police are tracking them down. Some blood and gore but not a lot.
2,WHISH I RENTED FIRST,"SHAKE! SHAKE! SHAKE! What is wrong with the camers operator ? Lance Henriksen is my favorite si-fi actor but this is in my opion the worst movie I have seen him in. Then there was the fancy or pathetic cutting,cramming and jumping what occured at the begining of the film, why bother ? The film seemed to be over exposed. There was a hint of quality in this film thanks to Lance. The story line was, well, OK. I find some of the home made sasquatch doco's more interesting and some times funny, simple but funny.And poor old sasy cops it in the end, what a sad ending. They unloaded there guns into the creature and "" THEN "" they decide to lower and place their guns on the ground and hold hands, I don't drink, smoke or take druges but I could use something to help me work out the ending. (SIMILE)"
2,Eh,"Its a so-so film. It does better than most sasquatch films but if you want a good one see Abominable""When a group of thieves are running from the police they end up in the mountains and enter a cabin to hold-up. It turns out the cabin belongs to Lance Henriksen and he does not want visitores but when a strage beast-like man attcks the house they must work together to find a way out alive. Meanwhile the police are hot on the trail of the thieves and soon run into the creature themselves and suffer a few casualties.Like so many of the Low Budget Monster flicks sasquatch mountain fails to captivate and ends like very otheer b-movie."
2,Simply Hilarious,"The Sci-Fi channel has once again delivered a great unintentional comedy by brigging us ""Sasquatch Mountain"". These films aren't loaded with much in the ways of a good story but they do pack a lot of laughs and entertainment.This one follows a group of thieves, some local authorities, and a really good looking lady who was taken hostage as they run through the forest to avoid sasquatch. That is pretty much it. It almost seemed as if the same scene was being repeated over and over again. One person would run, someone would chase them, the sasquatch would come flying out of nowhere and take them out. The laughs never stop due to the awful acting and moments where you patently await the next sasquatch attack.If you are looking for a well made movie then don't look this way. But if you are simply looking to be entertained by some good old horror b then Sasquatch Mountain is right up your alley."
3,"Good, but needed more atmosphere","This movie had a few things going for it that raised it up from the usual low budget monster movie.1. Lance Henrickson. I have yet to see him give a bad performance, even in some of the crappiest movies, and this one wasn't crappy.2. Decent plot. No massive plot holes.3. Acting from the rest of the cast was OK. Nothing stellar, but far from painful.The biggest problem I had with the movie was the location. The forest looked no more dense or threatening than the woods in my back yard. Had the lighting been darker and more moody, and the woods more remote feeling, I'd have given this a fourth star (4 stars for a low budget monster movie)."
4,Great popcorn entertainment,"This DVD has the original, uncut version of the movie shown on Sci-Fi a few months ago, and interestingly enough, on the DVD, the title is Devil On The Mountain, whereas the box art has it as Sasquatch Mountain. The movie itself I give 3 1/2 out of four stars. The plot is pretty tight and the effects are great too. Tiny Ron makes a great Sasquatch, and the ever-reliable Lance Henriksen does a great job. The rest of the cast are Curb Entertainment regulars except for Cerina Vincent, Craig Wasson (Body Double) and Rance Howard, such as Michael Worth, Tim Thomerson, Karen Kim and Candace Racquel. There is a terrific behind the scenes segment which shows the light-hearted spirit on the set and the fun had by the cast and crew. This is a great DVD, and well-worth having in your collection."
1,100 ft my a??!,I purchased this product for installation on a stairwell door. I walked up one flight of steps and the signal was gone. 15 feet max.
1,I feel lied to,"If anyone is looking to buy this product, please read the description carefully. The picture makes this look like a regular size jar, .63oz, of Tiger Balm. In actuality, what comes is not the same thing as the picture. Also, i believe the seller uses grams instead of ounces to intentionally misguide buyers. What I recieved in the mail was a tiny red tin, about the size of my thumb, from the tip to the first knuckle. The amount in ounces is .14oz. I am really disappointed in this product and feel as if I have been , if not directly lied to, then at the very least grossly mislead."
4,"Accept it for what it is, not the emulation quality","First off, many people don't like this game because the emulation is bad. Emulation? Why do you need an old game to be perfectly emulated? Okay, so the bleep sound was supposed to be a bloop. Does that make the game less fun? I've played many of the real Atari video game systems and yes, the games on here do differ, a lot in some games. What I look at is how good it is for what it is. Are the games fun? Yes. Are the controllers good? Yes. The controllers are better than the original pro-line controllers in my opinion and with hacking a Nintendo controller can be made to work with this. I understand people who are angry about spending the original price on this when it was new but I purchased mine for about 1/6 that. Warlords alone is worth how much these cost now. ^-^ Anywho, fun, emulation sucks, good value, ect..."
2,Where is the Programmer's Room?,"Stay away and wait for the Flashback 2.0, which looks much better. They really messed this one up. The sounds and graphics look like someone did them from memory rather than first playing them on a real atari. Worst is ADVENTURE. This has always been a favorite of mine, and was sad to see that the programmer's room was screwed up in the Jakks emulation, but here, it seems to not exist at all! There is something peculiar and thin looking about the graphics throughout and the gameplay is not the same at all (just try moving diagonally). The dragons don't so much chase you as simply impale themselves on the sword, and the bat's AI is very strange. I'd be curious to hear if anyone was able to find the dot or access the programmer's room easter egg in this version. Some of the other games were decent, but the klunky joysticks ruin the enjoyment."
2,"Not the best first try, but it has its uses.","I admit, I don't happen to be too terribly impressed with this product, but I commend Atari for the effort (for a much better job, try the Flashback 2 when they get the second version out in stores). A lot of the disappointment comes from both a.) the NES-on-a-chip style hardware, and b.) the games were not re-programmed very coherently.I do have to say, that since it IS ""NES-on-a-chip"", it could be used for other projects. Another thing is that the joysticks are FAR more comfortable than the original Pro-Lines, and those with some electronics know-how can make adapters to use these on their computer"
4,"oh,well...","This atari isn't really bad,but the atari flashback 2 is way better.The console is pretty and has some good games(e.g. centipede),but desert falcon is HORRIBLE!Asteroids on the 40's machines was much better.I like ""Centipede"",""Air-sea battle"",""Planet smashers"",""Sky diver"",and ""Yars' revenge"".I don't think some other games on this product ""made it"".It is really cool though.I personally like it,but there are many people who might rather buy an ""Xbox360"".So,my final verdict is:If you like 40's games,get this,or even better,get an Atari Flashback 2."
1,Very disapointed,"I have very little to say: No Enduro, no River Raid, no Pac-Man and no Pitfall.The best games of the 2600 console are missing, making the hole product pointless.Sorry, but for me, it looks like a great idea was lost. A shame."
2,A GOOD OL' FASHION THERMOMETER IS THE BEST,I tried using this with my daughter and she frowns and spits it out before I can get her temp. She is very picky; I think most babies are picky about what types of pacifiers they take...mine only takes NUK. She gets this thing in her mouth and it's not shaped like her regular binky so she won't keep it in her mouth. The bulb seems to be too long. She gagged on it. I only tried it once and decided to you a digital thermometer which is a better way to go.
3,"Good concept, but...","I loved this pacifier thermometer! I say ""loved"" because it no longer works (very disappointing). My two-month-old son spit it out one time and before I could catch it it had fallen onto our hardwood floors. Now it doesn't work! Just one time of being spit out and it's broken?! I think if they're going to improve on this product, they should improve on its durability. Otherwise, I really do believe it is a great product!"
1,Baby Expert,I thought his was a great idea when I saw it so I bought it. My daughter wouldnt take it because of the shape and its not something you can sterilize with out ruining it!
3,Works well but...,"When my son was newborn, this thermometer worked great. He would suck on it for the required time and the reading would be almost identical both auxillarily and rectally. The biggest problem I had was keeping my son interested in sucking on the pacifier long enough to get a reading as he got older. He cut himself off from the pacifier at about 4 months old and this method was no longer useful for us. If your child still uses a pacifier, this is probably a great choice for you."
3,I liked the idea it seemed easy,This product is great if you can keep it in your infants mouth long enough to read the temperature. It takes a while to read the temperature. My daughter spits it out.
1,Baby wouldn't accept,"I received this as a gift before my daughter was born and thought it was a pretty neat idea. After she arrived and I tried to use it one night, I found out quite differently! When I placed the pacifier in her mouth, if she'd been able to speak, she would have said something like ""What is this?"" and proceeded to promptly SPIT it out. I tried a second time and got the same response. We have always used the Avent pacifiers and this thermometer is shaped quite differently. If you have a baby that isn't used to this type of pacifier, buying this thermometer will be a waste of money. Ours is in a drawer and will never be used. We're sticking with the regular thermometer."
2,"good idea, but...","This is a good idea in theory, however, it just didn't work for us. Our son took a pacifier with no problems, but he knew this was different and just didn't want to hang on to it. Even though taking a rectal temp is no joy in itself, it's the best way to get an acurate reading. It's all our doctor's office would really take."
5,"Fantastic, even for stay-at-homes","I thought it was hilarious and I haven't ever been to Japan! I had lived in Europe for a few months, but that's the closest I'd been. So don't think you need to live in Japan before you can appreciate it!I will say, however, that you might want to read the sequel first. The sequel is funny, but not *as* funny as this one. Thus if you read this one first, the sequel is a bit of a letdown."
4,Still funny after all these years,"I first read this book in the late 1980s and just re-read it again last week and I still find it an accurate protrayal of life for the American in Japan. My parents lived there, I lived there briefly as a child, ny aunt and uncle lived there for 35 years, and I've had many friends live and work there and it's all true! If you have any familiarity with the perceived quirks of Japanese culture you will enjoy this book; just don't view it as a guide to living there because it's not meant that way."
3,another Mary Renault book,"After ""the Persian Boy"" this was recommmended to me, a love tiangle story played during the beginning of WWII in France among British boys. It was OK, rather wordy and not very dramatic."
4,The most serious novel by Renault I have read thus far,"The Charioteer reminded me very much of Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen, in theme rather than style. Renault's aversion to the sexual tribalists is very much apparent by the end of the book; it parallels Austen's disdain for romanticism. The book is eminently readable, if a bit slow (I give it 4 stars instead of 5 for its tendency to be a tedious read at times). The potential reader will get more out of this novel if he/she has a good grasp of Plato (especially the Phaedrus). In any case, Renault's departure from her powerful historical fiction set in Ancient Greece is a positive thing; The Charioteer is among Mary Renault's finest."
5,Fantasic styling cream,"I've use this stuff for a few days and it's already my favorite styling product so far. You don't have to use much, just rub it between your hands and work into your hair, and it holds a general shape for hours without feeling stiff at all. It has maybe the best smell of American Crew's classic line- smells like the kind of cream they put in donuts and pastries. It doesn't leave my hair nearly a shiny as I expected, which I'm sort of happy with. It's a fairly matted look, maybe a little shin. Might be shinier if I used more, but I doubt I'll ever need to. Great stuff."
2,Good hold but smells bad,"American Crew forming creme is full of nasty chemicals like parabens and urea. My hair smells really bad for at least 2 hours after application, and the smell never completely goes away. I keep it around for days when your hair just have to stand up, but I will stay with my Giovanni mousse for everyday use."
5,Pleased user since 02,"I have been using this product daily since 02 and I have to say that I couldn't be happier with a hair product. I will not use anything else (even the imitations). I have very thick hair and if I don't put anything in, my wife tells me that I look like a cue tip (hey, I accept, its true!). I find that it works best to use a small amount of cream and work it into DRY hair and mold it into style. *Warning* I had an outdoor job while in college and whenever it rained, my hair would drip beads of white water and the product would come out. I guess this is to be expected, but fair warning that you may want to use something else on rainy days (like an umbrella ;)."
3,Good but greasy,"I've used this product a lot over the years, but every time I've use it for a while, I move back to gel. Basically, the forming creme does a good job of keeping your hair controlled, but there downside is that your forehead will become ultra-greasy as the work day plods on. By close of business, your whole face feels quite a bit oilier than it would without this product.I recommend the creme, but also recommend that on those days when you do use it, that you wash your hair and face at the end of the day; otherwise, your complexion will start to suffer and your scalp might become irritated.I recently switched over to TIGI Bed Head After-Party Smoothing Cream for Silky, Shiny, Healthy Looking Hair! 3.4 oz, which doesn't feel greasy at all and makes your hair feel softer. I'll probably stick with that, despite the higher cost."
4,"Feels good, looks good, no mess","It's my first time using cream instead of mousse or gel. I like cream much better. That said, I haven't compared this to other brands. Sure, it's a bit pricier, but it's worth it. You get a quality product that doesn't leave residue like most gels do, and it is much stronger than mousse. Be sure to use just a little, then add more; this may appear to not suffice, but a little bit of a cream goes a long way. I'll keep using this product. Only thing with Amazon is that I had to buy 2, but that's ok. This a good product! I look slick, without being too pasty."
2,TITLE SHOULD BE TOP PUP,What a dissapointment of a book. While the training methods seem very reasonable. This book is totally geared for the new puppy owner or even prospective puppy buyer. He states in the book that obedience training should begin at age 49 days. and actually has the arrogance to say on page 26 that a dog that is a year old is untrainable. I cannot be the only person in the world who has aquired an adolescent dog that needs field training. Book is virtually worthless.
3,Interesting but not comprehensive,"As a collector, I have some sterling flatware purchased for daily use. However, I was unable to find one pattern in this book that matched the 50+ pieces I have. The photos and drawerings, however, are clear and detailed. Hopefully, someday I will be able to match a piece with the book!"
3,"A good effort, but incomplete","I purchased this book with the hope it would assist me in identifying the names of four patterns of silver (all of them pieces I had inherited.) I knew the manufacturers of each piece and knew the approximate date of manufacture (ranging from 1895 to 1956); this book could only give me the names of two of them. Although Maryanne Dolan gives a lot of background about the great American silver companies and their histories, there is no index to refer to; I had to read through each company's ""biography"" to learn (finally!) that Wm. Rogers was brought by International Sterling.For a silver enthusiast who is interested in researching many different patterns, this wouldn't be my first choice as a reference. Overall, though, it was informative."
1,Disappointing,"This book purports to be for the identification and value of American silver flatware. It is woefully incomplete. Where is Tiffany & Co.? Where are all the patterns that I would like to identify? Why is the layout so reader-unfriendly? And who cares that ""Baltimore City lies 200 miles from the Atlantic Ocean...""?"
2,Not the best.,I bought this book along with Sterling Flatware by Tere Hagan. I find it difficult to use and poorly organized. She has a lot of information on certian patterns and makers but little on others. There is no index and information is incomplete. I use it as a back up to Hagan's book as she sometimes will have a pattern that Hagen dosen't have. Neither book is complete and this book has some information and a couple of Manufactures that Hagan dosen't cover still both books are valuable but even together not complete. I still have quite a few unknowns in my collection.
5,Whacky and Wonderful,"Tired of the same old character cliches? Sick of the same old plots? Well, drive yourself over to the Blue Yonder Inn where you'll meet a memorable assortment of oddballs whose resumes aren't exactly worth a second call. Bonnie Blue, the down-and-out protagonist, leaves Blackie, her baby, in a wheelbarrow outside the Blue Yonder Inn and heads out on her own hero's journey. On the run from her good-for-nothing husband Gil, Bonnie meets up with more curious folk - some unsavory, some endearing. This story is sharp, fast paced, and has well drawn characters. Helen Campbell's biting wit makes even the most tragic of circumstances humorous. You'll find yourself laughing and sympathizing with people you might otherwise avoid completely."
1,copy not good,The copy of this book it is not good. The letter case it is too small and sometimes could not be clear to understand. Missing the table of contents.
1,Painful and even dangerous generalization/simplication,"Apparently, any sort of fellow will fit into one of a variety of categories that the authors flag as losers. According to the book, I'm contradictory categories for being assertive and confident in some cases, but I'm a co-dependent leech for being attentive and caring. It also makes assumptions about different men's pasts which will automagically make them a ""loser"" without hope for recourse or repair. I put this book in the same category as DeAngelis books which match certain personality types and state that a relationship will or will not work according to some hard formula...which is rarely, if ever, the case. The saving grace is that yes, certain types of men/relationships ought to be avoided or removed from your life, such as with abuse. But I'll save my next reading for when I want to feel bad for remembering that my girlfriend likes coffee ice cream."
2,How to ensure a life alone,"If you want to live in denial about your fear of intimacy, this is the book for you! This book eliminates 99% of all men as being even the least bit worthy of taking a chance on. Another good alternate title might be ""So You'rr Codependent: How To Make Sure You Never Recover"". It would be laughable if it wasn't so damaging to those who will believe anything they read if it means they don't have to look in the mirror and face up to their own imperfections."
2,Be Real,"These 2 simpleton girly-men have taken many normal male tendencies and have made them into abnormal ""RED FLAGS"". For instance, if a man lifts the hood of a womans car and fixes something for her, its a ""RED FLAG"".......just because these two wusses couldn't change a light bulb without having some trouble <lol>.Most of this book leans towards the feminization of the American male that most are rejecting recently.The sorry part is most women can not see through much of the foolishness in this book, and truly belive they have learned something beneficial...without a second opinion. Yes, some of whats in this book is true...but to be so generalized?If you are not completely PC, and want a MAN that you can be truly happy with, you may have to accept many ""RED FLAGS"", as anything w/ testosterone in it will have these ""RED FLAGS""."
5,"Funny, Informative, and Eye Opening","This book catagorizes people into types that are losers. Yellow flag losers may be worth the effort, while RED flag losers need to be weeded out. The book even tells you how to get rid of a loser.The book is FUNNY, but also informative. Although you know the guy is a loser, sometimes it is difficult to put your finger on what is wrong. This book helps. The book helped me see some similarities in the losers I have met. It also helps to educate you on how to get out of the relationship. Some losers are easy to leave, but there are others that you just can't run from either because they keep returning, or because they become violent.There is one loser that the book does not mention. That is the one of the selfish or stingy person.I really enjoyed this book."
1,Ode to the single lifestyle,Embrace this book if you're seeking the means and the personal strength to remain alone for the rest of your life. But fear not: your decision to lead a lonely lifestyle will be completely justified within the pages of this book.
4,Wish I'd had this BEFORE I started dating the loser!,This is a really easy-to-read book that gives lots of information about different kinds of losers. There's a point system that can help you figure out if your new guy's a loser before you waste too much time!
5,A Realistic Look at Dating,"Although the authors give several examples of different types of men (which easily could be applied to some women as well); Red flags is an easy read that will have both you and your perspective or permanent mate deliciously defining your friends, relatives and past romantic mistakes. It is a fun book. Bring it to the beach and hand it to your friend/lover and join the fun by asking ""Which one are you?"""
3,Useful advice for dating,"This book should be very useful for BOTH genders in weeding out some ""Losers"" in the dating game (men aren't the only ones who are ""Pleasers"" and ""Know-it-Alls""). I've been single again for a few weeks, having just broken up with ""The Burdened Beast"". It was difficult to make a clean break, but now I'm glad I did it, as it was exhausting and ultimately harmful to my own emotional health. Use caution and your own gut feelings when choosing your significant others, but this book should be of some help. Good luck!"
