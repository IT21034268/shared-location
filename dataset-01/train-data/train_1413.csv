5,Paul Fronts The Ramones!?,"Like you, I had given up on Paul McCartney.Living legend? Yes. Rock Icon? Absolutely. One of the greatest songwriters and performers of the 20th Century? No question.BUT...Exciting current performer? Ummm...not really.""Flaming Pie"" was encouraging, but flaccid and ultimately seemed a little like he was stretching to stay interested.""Run Devil Run"" (the song and the album) is a true return to form. For the most part, he avoids the obvious covers and sings a group of classic songs I never heard before. Even when he does a well-known oldie, [""All Shook Up""] he goes for the jugular and plays it like he's fronting the Ramones.This album's a reminder of why those storied punk pioneers may have taken their band name from one of Paul's earliest stage names.No maybe about it, I'm amazed."
4,good rockin' with great energy,Paul is as good as ever on this album. He sounds younger and more hungry than for a long time.
4,HIDDEN GEMS,"PAUL REACHES INTO THE COFFERS FOR SOME HIDDEN GEMS FROM THE PAST. EVEN ON A COUPLE OF THE MORE FAMILIAR SONGS HE PUTS A NEW TWIST ON THEM SO THEY AREN'T EASILY RECOGNIZED. NO OTHER BABY AND LONESOME TOWN ARE TWO OF THE STANDOUTS. THE VOCALS ARE FRESH AND NOT MASKED BY PRODUCTION. AS THE GREAT LINER NOTES POINT OUT, THE SONGS ALL HAVE THE FEEL AS IF THEY WERE PLAYED AND RECORDED ON THE SPOT WITH THE VERY RECORDING TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS USED WHEN THEY WERE ORIGINALLY PENNED. AS YOU PICTURE THE BAND PLAYING THEM, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT PICTURE THE BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOS OF THE CAVERN CLUB AS THEIR STAGE."
5,The Best McCartney Since The Beatles,"Incredible collection of rock and roll classics, plus 3 great new originals. The sound is thick and rocking, and McCartney has never sounded in better voice. This is great stuff"
4,Back Sooner Than Expected,"A great ""comeback"" for McCartney. Considering the lose of his wife Linda last year, nobody would have expected him to come out with a new CD so soon even if it is mostly cover versions of obscure 50's singles and B sides, with three 50's style originals mixed in. It should also put to rest once and for all if McCartney was/is a great rock n roll singer or not. Give that one a break will ya critics! Anyhow, if you look at the ex-Beatles body of work, the other three don't even come close despite Paul's weaker moments. It will be interesting to see how this one stands up on todays charts along such light weight's as Ricky Martin and the Backstreet Boys. But sales won't be the final measurement of this album nor should they be. Its great music for those who love rock n roll and appreciate a great artist back from adversity and playing the music he loves."
4,MAC IS BACK!,"For many years, a new album by a Beatle was a major event. EVERYONE knew about it, whether they liked them or not. That was before Rap took over. Since then, only the Baby Boomers who grew up with them and the die-hard geeks like me really cared with anticipation disregarding the fact that we hadn't heard a single note prior to buying it.I haven't perked my ears up listening to one of Paul's albums for the first time since hearing Press to Play in 1986.His voice is in excellent shape. He's got a sense of urgency and freshness I haven't heard in years. He took old, mostly unfamiliar songs and made them his own intead of emulating them note-for-note. The musicians he chose sound more like a band than a group of back-ups.If artists like Limp Bizkit and Korn can come up with fresh albums when they're 57 it's because they got the OK from Paul-It's OK to keep the flame that got you started in the first place-no matter what your age.Thank you Sir Paul for rekindling my ""flame""."
3,Hardy Boys in Bayport.,"This is an average Hardy Boys mystery. It has lots of quick-paced action, but is nothing spectacular."
3,A mystery of murder and sabotage.,"This is an averaga Hardy Boys book: a recycling campaign, dead security guards, and plenty of fast-paced action. This is a good book for kids."
5,Greatest Thing Since Sliced Bread!,"Who wants to scrub away at dirty grout and grubby faucets with an old tooth brush? NOT me! This little cleaning tool with the aid of a bowl of clorox and water, makes the details of bathroom cleaning into child's play. No more broken fingernails and tedious brushing! I'm very happy to say that this gadget will improve your quality of life in a modest,but important,way. Have fun!"
1,Sonic Scrubber or Sonic Flubber?,"Sonic Scrubber is terrible. Slightest pressure on the wand stops the motion of the scrubbing brush. Oh and there's nothing sonic about the scrubber other than the noise it makes. After trying to use this to scrub the shower, I felt that the method of getting out the gloves and the scrubbing sponge with bathroom cleaner with bleach is still the best method. It is a plastic POS made God knows where designed to draw money out of the pocket."
1,Waste of Money,"As the other poor reviews have stated here, this product doesn't work any better (and possibly worse) than a manual brush. It is accurately named however: ""SONIC"" scrubber-- it does MAKE NOISE! Woo Hoo! BUT, this is not to be confused with an ""ULTRASONIC"" type cleaning technique which is quite effective at cleaning things like jewelry and industrial parts.Also, don't you have to wonder about the value of anything that has to be hawked on TV by the guy that always yells? Are these things ever worth even the ""S&H;"" charge?"
3,coming of age in the 80s,"Joe, the product of a divorced home in Long Island, just wants to fit in. He thinks he's found niche when he discovers punk rock, and a group of like minded friends at his new private school, but he really finds the love of his life when he hears the Smiths.HOW SOON IS NEVER is the story of how Joe stumbles through life looking for something he thinks only the Smiths can give him. By the time he reaches 30, he's a hard drinking music writer who wants to reunite the Smiths with the help of Miki, the woman he loves.The second half of the book is bit labored, including somewhat redundant cameos by 3/4 of the Smiths, and the life lesson can be seen a mile away, but there's enough funny, moving, and honest stuff here for me to recommend this - as well as great affection for the music. Anyone who has read Nick Hornby will enjoy this ...."
1,how soon till spitz stops?,"trite. self-indulgent. pseudo-important. grandiose. egotistical. idiotic.just like spitz's music journalism. which proves what we have thought since spitz hit the scene: marc spitz is the julian cassablancas of music critics who want to be novelists but who inevitably suck--toure, et al."
4,A Pretty Good Book About An Absolutely Brilliant Band,"Marc accurately captures the excitement that many of us felt when we first heard all of the amazing music from the U.K. on WLIR in the early to mid '80s. In those days you couldn't download songs using Kazaa, you just had to wait for the song to be played on the radio again so you could hopefully tape it in its entirety. This book isn't for everyone, but it's recommended if you have any nostalgia for the 1980s. Yes, the Smiths are timeless but '80s music was much more than New Wave and New Romanticism; it was really never just about the music. In the end, How Soon Is Never? isn't just about the Smiths."
2,Decent memoir; terrible novel,"The first half of the book, which is basically a memoir of Spitz's teenage years, does a pretty good job of re-capturing that experience -- not bad for a grownup. I especially liked the part where the characters spend weeks imagining what the Smiths might sound like, before they actually get to hear them -- we forget how difficult it was, back in the '80s, just to hear anything that wasn't on top 40 radio. Just like Spitz (or his character, which I take to be him, pretty straight up), I was sure that the Smiths would make angry, distorted, parent-annoying punk music -- and was quite surprised to find that they made sweet, jangly pop (though still with plenty to annoy the parents).However, the second half of the book, in which Spitz tries to imagine a new plot, doesn't quite work. Stick to memoir, man, and you could do good stuff."
1,Inspiring,"As an unpublished writer, the fact that this book was published by a major publishing house and was, somewhat, widely read gives me the motivation I need to continue writing. If this book can get published, I can write a book worth publishing.The characters in this book are completely one dimensional. They feel like caricatures of real people, and I didn't care about them at all. At times, I wondered if that was the point, and the book was supposed to be some kind of farce; but somehow, I don't think so. The worst part is when Joe's parents are sending him to rehab and he insists on going to these posh recovery centers - only to escape immediately after arriving. It didn't seam like a realistic thing for a strung out kid to do, and I wonder if Spitz was kidding.Seriously, it's been about five years since I read this book, and I still think about it every once in a while, and I check online hoping to find that it's now out of print. This is probably the worst book I've ever read."
3,not what I needed,These did not fit 2001 Nissan Maxima AT ALL. I ended up taking off some of the edges thinking it would fit but it still didn't...too long and too much 'tuck tab' to fit in between weather stripping as the pieces should. Couldn't return once I mutated pieces :(DO NOT buy for 5th gen maxima.Can't speak for other vehicles.
5,Love these,"Both of my boys love these. As another reviewer said I took a leap of faith based on the reviews that my kids would like these. I thought they were somewhat expensive (I paid $39) but they have been totally worth it. The cars/trucks are a perfect size for their hands and it is pretty impressive how smooth they roll. We have had them in water, sand and all over our house. I was glad I bought the 15 piece bucket as there is such a nice variety. They also work with the Megablocks car transporter truck, which the boys also love. I am always finding these cars, airplanes, helicopter and trucks in it. They only thing they find difficult is hooking the pieces together, which is a task I sometimes find a little tricky myself, but is a cool option (especially with the train)."
2,Very boring for my 2 1/2 year old....may be better for younger toddlers,My 2 1/2 year old played with these once and that was IT ! He prefers the hotwheels and matchbox cars much MUCH more. This product is better suited for kids under 2 years of age IMO.
5,Great group of toys,We were happily surprised at the quality of each toy in the tub. Easy storage & good variety for our grandson's visits.
5,Excellent quality toy,"I ordered this for a one-year-old, and it was an instant hit. Outstanding quality at a reasonable price, and the storage bucket is an additional bonus."
5,Great book for your child and his/her school library. Wish it had the Farsi translation alongside the English text.,"My children attend the local Montessori program. I bought two copies of the book, one for them at home and one for their school. Before the new year I donated the book along with a small Sabzeh (sprouts grown for Persian New Year) to the classroom library. Their teacher loved it and read the book aloud for other children.I read this and all other books in Farsi for my children, so I wish the author had provided the Farsi translation as well. They are at an age now that can distinguish Farsi script from English, and wonder how or why I am reading an English book in Farsi!"
3,Okay for starters....,"Norouz is a very special holiday for Persians. I was a bit disappointed that the book is very basic and does not give the holiday a bit of ""magic"". Talks about going to the grocery, watching TV and calling relatives over the phone...while true, it does not attempt to paint Norouz as more meaningful."
2,Very Basic,"The book is a very basic and is written by a person which is neither good in English nor in Farsi. Definitely does not paint the right picture of Norouz for reader.The activity part is so simple and plain.This book is about New year and Norouz but all the people in this book look Sad and Unhappy. Colors are dark and you do not see enough Green which we think, it is the colour of New year and Norouz.We took this book to school for new year and shared it with teacher and kids and they like it.This book is good for smaller kid up to 7-year-old."
1,"Cute book, not worth more than $5.00","While this book has a cute little story written in it about a kid and what his family does for Nowruz/Persian New Year, it fails to deliver the quality of a book that costs almost $13.00. There is only one story, very basic with drawings that look like they were done by a five year old. The activities included are only a few coloring pages that again looks like it was drawn by a very young child. I would NOT RECOMMEND this book to be purchased by anyone for anything over $5.00. For the price I expected MUCH more and its description is deceiving. It does not have many activities and the story does not appropriately capture the true essence of this beautiful holiday."
3,Interesting Translation,"Interesting translation of Lysistrata. Very earthy, perhaps too much so for less than adult readers. Nevertheless, a rather accurate translation of this classic."
3,It has it moments...,"I love the album title, which is what got my attention. I like how this group lumps together different styles to create a very accessible blend of country, indie pop, blues, while even managing a dash of funk and soul. The opening track features some creepy sounding calliope-like keyboard effects; this is not your run-of-the-mill indie band. There are drum loops and vocal samples, making it hard to pigeonhole them as purely folk or country. The more up tempo songs are guitar-driven, often supplied with a thumping beat and they use some interesting synth bleeps and squawks. On ""Arlington Girl"" and ""Lunch"", the songs have a fragile and honest feel, thanks to lead vocalist's Ambrosia Parsley's melancholic voice. This cd is no more than a pleasant listen, so to call it brilliant would be stretching it. ""Lunch"" and ""Goodnight Moon"" are memorable tracks which make this cd worth checking out."
3,Paula Cole syndrome,"If you haven't already heard the single ""Goodnight Moon"" on the radio, you will: The song has all the potential to be the 2000 version of Paula Cole's ""Where Have All the Cowboys Gone."" Like that hit, Shivaree's effort is impeccably catchy, quirky, and ear-friendly.But Shivaree share one less welcome trait as well: The album largely fails to sustain the strength of its one hit single.Sure, the singing and songwriting are eminently competent, and the music is just right for a quiet Sunday afternoon on the lakeshore. Like a quiet lakeshore, it's just ""there,"" not really making any effort to be noticed -- although Ambrosia Parsley's voice gets a little repetitive by the seventh or eighth song with little variation.With such a provocative album title, you'd think this disc would work well as compelling, attention-demanding foreground music. But, no; except for ""Moon,"" it will glide effortlessly through the background of your day."
3,Give This a Shot,"Inspired, pleasant and captivating, Shivaree`s debut is a worthwile addition to the alternative pop world, presenting a new project with consistent ideas. This band mixes pop, rock, folk, blues, country, cabaret sounds, funk, lo-fi and electronica to create a distinct, moody and complex album with enough creativity and wit. Ambrosia Parsley`s voice is rich, seductive and appealing, managing to be both menacing and touching. The songs are intricated and full of intriguing textures and elements, and require multiple listens to truly absorb.This is a very promising debut, a strong offering from a talented and versatile band that dares to bring some freshness and innovation to the music scene. Not bad."
4,One of the best albums of the year.,"When I picked up the album I didn't know what to expect. After first listen it's hard to miss it's delicate beauty and heartfelt emotion. What you might miss is with what complexity the vocals and music are crafted for maximum emotion. To say the least I was very pleased. Not since Stina Nordenstam's ""And She Closed Her Eyes"" & Garrison Star's ""18 Over Me"" have I heard a better album. Give it a try. Drive in your car at night and you will find a new soundtrack for life. Brilliant!"
3,Goodnight Moon,"Love Ambrosia Parsley's singing voice. Haunting in some ways, smooth, soothing... It seems, though, about the only winner is tune #7, Goodnight Moon, on this CD. This won't stop me from buying something else by this group, or by Ambrosia, should she venture out on her own.Was it worth buying this CD? For me, yes. Absolutely. Can't get enough of Goodnight Moon; also, this seems to be the type of album one has to play a few times to truly appreciate the music."
2,Disappointing after Goodnight Moon,"I bought this based on hearing Goodnight Moon from the Kill Bill 2 soundtrack, as well as reviews here.Nothing on this CD comes close to the polish and beat of Goodnight Moon. To me it's all forgettable One Hit Wonder stuff."
5,Don't read any other review but this one,"Listen to this CD and judge for yourself. Don't listen to reviews written by those who'd fall back on that tired old line: ""It's like a cross between so-and-so and so-and-so"". Remember: The only thing greater than the unimaginative soul's capacity for doling out criticism is his fervent desire to be taken seriously in doing so.Give 'em a shot right in the head by passing on their views and coming up with your own.Peace."
3,Grandchildren loved it - but it is very loud,My grandchildren loved this toy and it is very durable. It should really be an outside toy because it is very loud and annoying to us grownups.
5,Genius,"Quite simply, Judee Sill is the female equivalent to Gram Parsons in terms of the influence of future generations of Female Americana artists and the crazy thing is most of them wouldn't even know it. This album is timeless, beautiful, and I am so glad I finally bought it. Every music lover should own this album. If you own one Joni Mitchell and like it then get this. A gem."
2,"Good Arrangements, Bad Singing and Stupid Lyrics","This is another one of those ""lost masterpieces"" that looks intriguing in the record shop, becomes more so as you read through the liner notes on the commuter train, but the by the time you get home and listen for five minutes, you know you've been had. How to describe this? Well, the instrumental arrangements are actually pretty cool, but the singing is mechanical and the lyrics are what I would call stupid. It adds up to an unpleasant mismatch sounding like a bad karaoke vocalist fronting a professional band.Also, the album cover is a little misleading. The front is just Judee next to a tree looking down, but the back shows her next to a tree playing a guitar. It suggests at least some self-accompanied guitar and voice songs, but there are none."
3,Nice Memoir of family life with death coming,Nice insight on how to spend the last few months with a loved one before death. Beautiful writing. Well done on a difficult subject. I learned a lot on how a loving and wealthy family can function under all conditions and maintain their ties and history. Much better book Than Dideon's on similar subject that I bought at the same time.
1,The world's least funny Jews.,It's a shanda! I bought this book because I thought that with would tear down the myths always told about Jews - about matzoh being made from blood or that whole christ killing thing - but this is just a lame attempt at mad magazine style humor. It is not funny. It is tedious. Only the writers think this is funny. How did it get published? Was there an editor involved? I actually got a headache reading this book. I gave it to someone I don't like very much. This is not going to be part of the canon of Jewish humor. It is going to be part of the canon of Jewish sh-t.
4,Conspiracy Satirists,"This is a great gift book, filled with gags, particularly suited for those individuals engaged with the Jewish community or Jewish causes.A great gift particularly for those concerned about rising antisemitism, as the authors underlying message is really to not take these hateful and absurd accusations to heart.A hysterical gift for someone who is actually engaged in conspiracy theories."
3,Paper Construction is not the best for this filer,"This is a good product that performs as advertised. However, the paper construction means that you must be careful opening and closing this filer. The paper warps and could eventually break."
1,Diminished value,"I purchased the Smead expanding file two years ago. I was initially impressed with file folders, which not only contained letters of the alphabet; but also categories such as automobile receipts, insurance and tax receipts etc. However, within a year of the folder's intended use.....namely holding bills and receipts, the organizer had totally disintegrated rendering the product useless. Under no circumstances would I recommend and/or purchase the Smead product again.."
1,P.O.S. Won't hold air,I have purchased two of the Everlast 4208 bags and neither will hold air. I thought the first was a fluke so I made the mistake of purchasing a second. They will hold air for about a week.
3,works well,works well and I have been using it for over a year now and I still enjoy it and will continue to.
3,bag was ok,the speed bag was ok bigger than i thought but person selling it sent it to me very fast came as described
5,Great rhyming book,"This is one of Karma Wilsons best! We love ""The bear snores on"" and this is right up there!! It has a funny story line with lots of rhyming. My kids loved it and laughed along with me. Great book"
5,Love this book!,"I LOVE reading this book to my children. The rhyming text makes it fun to read. And my children like to say ""And the frog grows a little bit bigger"" along with me each time. I purchased my copy a while back, and now I'm back to check into getting some for gifts. You can't go wrong with this book!"
5,A Wonderful book for young children,"I first encountered this book at a local children's bookstore when it was read during story time. My 2-1/2 year old son loves this book. It is written in a wonderful ""sing-song"" style, which keeps my son's attention. The illustrations are really beautiful too. A wonderful book."
4,Great for bedtime reading,My three year old daughter loves the book specially saying out the paragraphs loud with me. It has also diversified her reading out of TV and Disney characters based books.The photographs are drawn very beautifully and should appeal more as she gets older.
5,Fantastic read-aloud book,"This is a great read-aloud book for kids of all ages. My 3-year-old loves it (though I think I may like it even more than she does!) and we periodically get it from the library to read over and over.The style of the story is perfect for young listeners - the frog starts by eating one small bug, then adds two larger ones, three even bigger, and so on. The rhythm is what makes this book the fantastic read-aloud that it is. You can take the pace slow, then speed it up as the alligator creeps to the surface.The illustrations are almost beautiful ... if they weren't supposed to be gross - bugs in the belly of a frog doesn't make the prettiest picture! But they sure do try.This is one of our favorite books so far in the life-span of my 3-year-old, and we have read a lot of books. Take our word for it and try this one out."
2,"Love the story, but boring Illustrations",I love Kharma's books and bought this one online. I was very satisfied with the story. I can read it over and over without getting sick of it. The only problem is that the illustrations are totally monochromatic and a little too abstract for little ones so they get easily bored looking at the pictures. Too bad. It's a great story for counting!
3,"Not bear, not very cute","One of the few picture books I've ever returned. I didn't realize when I was looking at 'A Frog in the Bog' that it's basically a 'little old lady who swallowed a fly' story except with a frog. One, maybe two, of those is cute but this would have been the fourth and that really is too many. Besides that, it's not a cute story that you want to read again and again. The drawings are nothing like her bear stories."
3,De Verdad no me gusto mucho,"el cd tiene unas cuantas canciones buenas, pero no me gusto por que esta lleno de rookies al reggaeton. pero la cancion ""Sacala"" esta a fuego!!"
3,This book will not help to pass the test period.,"I took the test today and I failed miserably. I am certified NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 MCSE. I thought the book was good but was off the mark to pass Microsoft test 70-292.Once again, the Transcender tests are the only thing to use to pass the test. It is not the fault of the Exam Cram series but the way Microsoft writes the question. This test (70-292) was poorly written by Microsoft and some of the questions and choices were very confusing."
3,Very Little Help,"I passed many a test using the Exam Cram books, but this one was no help. It's more like a review and missing many details found on the test."
3,Cadillac connector,This compression connector is good; but not worth the price. The Amazon description does not say how many you get in an order. You get just one. I think Home Depot or Lowe's sell good connectors for less.
3,Sounds great but fell apart,"These headphones sound great but they fell apart. We were using them with a portable DVD player while on vacation in Florida. I guess the heat in the car was too much for them.The outer cushion and foam pieces on the headphones were held on with double sided tape (at least that's what it looks like). The tape stopped sticking and those pieces fell off of the headphones. We bought some tape and stuck them back together. It works but it's not pretty.I don't know why these headphones were manufactured with tape. Maybe it's cheaper?These headphones do work great but they're not very sturdy. If you buy them, handle them carefully and don't leave them in a hot car like we did."
1,They broke and Amazon has no idea how to contact the vendor,"I bought these as a gift for my wife to use on airplane trips, she takes about 4 per year. Over the past 11 months, she's used them on about 6 flights and enjoyed the quality of the product and the user experience.On her most recent flight, they broke - the left earpiece detached and hangs by a wire. Since it has been almost a year, Amazon told me to contact the manufacturer, Tech B. I did a Google search and was unable to find the company, so I contacted Amazon for vendor contact information. They have none, I'm on my own. Looks like I'm SOL, so I'll get a replacement of something else. Jeff Bezos, shame on you. Customer service? Not!"
2,Sound quality ok but poor construction,"My headphones fell apart the first time I used them and I had to glue all the foam pieces back together. The sound quality was just okay, but I would spend more money next time and get a better quality headphone."
3,Worth the money,"Noise cancelling function works pretty well. I can definitely tell the difference between ""on"" and ""off"". I've compared them with Bose headphonse, and Bose sets are a lot better (better noise cancelling and more comfortable). I'd rather have the battery and control module integrated into the headset, but the clip on the control module allows me to clip it to my shirt pocket. I purchased one set, and on my first airline trip (overseas) one of the ear cups came loose from the headphones. Had no problem returning to Amazon for exhange. The replacement set has the same problem, but I've gotten proficient at putting it back in place. The issue is that it doesn't have a travel case. I use a bag to carry it and the connector cable and adapters in my computer travel bag. Therefore, the headphones are sometimes tightly packed in my bag. However, I don't believe Bose headphones would have the same problem, and they come with a nice travel case. Of course, you pay a lot more for Bose."
2,dissapointing,"The noise cancellation system produces a lot more hiss than I expected. For quiet passages of classical music, the headphones produced more noise than they canceled.I tried some more expensive Sennheisers at a store, and there was no detectable hiss."
2,"It is not for a 32"" deck","I can't find a chute for a 32"" deck.I tried to get Sears to give me a part number with no luck. They don't know anything. I looked here and found two chutes. I took a chance on the one that had no reviews saying it was for the 48"" hoping it fit the 32. It doesn't. so I am down 24 bucks in shipping cost for trying."
5,my favorite collection of music,"peace lilly, gives a flavor of the entire album, acoustic, mellow, sincere, sometimes religous. my favorite is ""i know what Christ would do"". more up beat than most songs on the album, and delivers parts of the sermon on the mount better than any Christian musician possibly could. the best song is probably ""tendin' to the blaze"", which is pretty slow, but describes how life can be way to busy. the whole album is acoustic with no special effects needed. check it out."
3,plodding account of life of little known figure.,This book is very academic and plodding. I enjoyed the class but not this book. It was hard to read and boring. I had to force myself to get through it.
3,"Up to date, colloquial, and conversational, but not thorough","Insufficient exercises and shallowness in the explanations of grammar are the biggest problems with this book. Use it as a supplement to a more thorough text, though, and it is very useful. The dialogues have very good content and the recorded versions are excellent--easy to listen to and not at all dry or stilted. The tapes also have question-and-answer sections where you can practice your spoken Hungarian. It's better than the average Teach Yourself books, so if you like that style you can expect satisfaction from this."
2,It rather circles its intended purpose.,"Teach Yourself Hungarian could do a little better. It's great if you're going to visit Hungary and not gain full proficiency, but it seems to fail being an effective grammatical text. First mistake--it starts off with dialogs, afterwards giving you a lengthy vocabulary list. The book may be for you if you can learn off of phrases alone, rather than taking apart each phrase and looking at a language word-by-word. If you are truly looking to 'teach yourself', may it be suggested to try something else"
1,One star being the highest,"These cassettes and this book have honestly got to be the worst investment that I've ever made in language-learning. It constantly skips around from one section to another, without even telling you! They hardly ""teach"" you anything. In fact, they only let you hear a dialogue once, and from that you are expected to know everything about what was said. As I'm teaching myself my third language, I feel that I can say that it was terrible compared to other purchases. Don't throw away your money on it like I did, try another one instead"
5,Worth watching over and over,I love this film. Humor is very British(dry) and extremely funny. Well written story and you really feel connected to the actors based on their wonderful performances
2,The End of the Book,"It was a chore getting through this book, but was ultimately rewarding at the end. The mention of Komar and Melamid and their Most Wanted Series, at the books finale was interesting and fufilling, and spoke more to the books purpose then the remaining hundred plus pages. There were a few other bright points, but really the rest of the book was more chest pounding and weak attempts at journal-like academia. Danto became famous for a single point, and it seems he intends to beat that point to death. If that is his intention he has done an excellent job."
3,It's ok for very small shredding needs,"I keep the shredder near the trash can so I can simply shred incoming mail. This is not a big time shredder so don't expect to shred more than a couple of peices at a time. In addition you will need to rip most sheets vertically so that the shredder will cut across the words on the sheet. This is the second unit I have had, first one lasted several years until it finally burnt out. The letter opener works just fine as intended."
5,"Anson Funderburgh and the Rockets ""live at the Emporium""","After having the pleasure of hearing this truly original Blues Band for myself at the old ""Loafers"" club in Raleigh, NC. I can only say that the Blues does'nt get any better than this. My complimentory copy of this CD was signed and given to me by Carl""Sonny""Leyland, who is without question one of the greatest piano players I've ever heard. As it turns out we are both fond of the cactus worm. If you're a fan of rockin'boogie woogie piano music, you really should look him up. He has three new albums available now at Amazon.com ""Boogie & Blues"" has my favorite piano version of ""The House of Blue Light"" It's Number 18 on the list. You gotta here this man play this song. The hair on your neck will stand stright up!"
3,"Light camera, average results!","I had Dynax 7000i for quite some time, and since the body developed cracks, I replaced that first with Maxxum 4. But that particular piece would occasionally turn off immediately after being turned on. So I returned that and bought Maxxum 5, with Vectis-1 flash. I am sorry to day that I got results worse that Maxxum4, and both were not comparable to what I got with my old rusty trusty Dynax 7000i. The advantages are light weight and small size. I didn't fancy the eye start very much, as I use it mostly in manual mode. To use the D lens's strength, you need to have D flashes, which are not cheap. There is absolutely no vignetting. If you shoot in burst mode, then it doesn't disappoint you.Final word - there are much better cameras out there for this price."
2,Strained dialogue and transparent plot,"Perhaps I was expecting a little too much of this book after reading Palmer's The Fifth Vial, which I found thrilling and well-written. I felt the dialogue in The Society was strained and that certainly made it all less believable for me. This was a barely entertaining yet quick read, and I easily figured out who was behind everything about halfway through. I will (cautiously) give Palmer another shot and am hoping he impresses once again."
2,Barely okay,"This is my third Palmer book, and my least favorite of the three. The overall storyline kept me going, but it's just not that great of a book as far as believability, dialogue quality and character development. The ending seemed a far stretch (downright silly, actually) and the epilogue was annoyingly preachy and one-dimensional. Meanwhile each character was purely one-dimensional - either ""good"" or ""bad"" - a bit simplistic, in my opinion. This had potential - but the author could simply have done it better."
4,HMO's Beware,I found the stories regarding the HMO's to be entertaining. The plot was fast and kept me going. Sometimes unbelievable things happen and you have to give the author a pass to keep the story rolling. (lady cop survives being shot in head but then can single handedly take down 3 tough bad people - highly unlikeley)I found Michael Palmer to be a new author i just found. Having first read Medical Cure and now this.This book is worthy of a run through.
3,Not Up To Par,"It's a good story: A vicious serial killer is on the loose and the victims have one thing in common: they are all high-profile executives in the managed care industry. With a story like that, you'd think it would be a fast paced, thrilling read. I was wrong. I couldn't wait to read Michael Palmer's new book but was so disappointed when I got it. It's such a slow read for the first 150 pages. His attempts to make the minor characters stand out are overdone and intrusive. By the time the book started getting good, it was nearly over. All of his other books are great, except this one."
1,Disappointing,"""The Society"" was a poor read.The plot was lame; the characters terribly stereotyped.Quite a superficial book, perhaps written more as propaganda rather than for literary purposes.Palmer could have written a decent book had he really chosen to explore the abuses of the HMO system.Instead Palmer chose to write something on the order of pulp fiction that would have bored a junior high student."
2,"Same Old, Same Old.","A bit disappointed. I really enjoyed ""The Patient"" but have been under whelmed with this authors more recent books. He is very talented at creating likeable protagonists and unlikable villains. I have however, become really tired of the same basic plot: a likeable physician gets involved with a villain or group of villains, the doctor's reputation is ruined, the doctor uncovers the notorious (and often unbelievable) scheme."
2,medical fiction....socialist preaching,"The premise of The society is written using a tired formula: Evil Corporations with unlimited power start killing to make $$. The plot is absurd. There are some interesting stories of managed care abuses and shortcomings. Then there are more and more and more. Palmer does a decent job of showing some of the problems with managed care then makes the misguided leap that the answer is socialism! He holds out the Canadian system as the ideal ( I know for a fact that it is not). If you think that socialism is the answer to our problems, you may enjoy this book. If you want to understand the complexities of healthcare and think for yourself, this book is not for you. Again, the plot is laughable, the message is aimed at the simple minded."
2,Just so silly,"This book starts out well. The character development of Dr. Will Grant is good. It gradually descends, though, into sort of a 'Dawn of the Dead ghouls as HMO executives'. The kidnap event in the end is very poorly done. I spent alot of time feeling embarrassed for the author as I listened to this book."
2,Not worthy,The problem with this book is that you don't know if you want to pick it up or just do anything else including sleeping. The main plot is fairly regular so you'll make an endeavor task to keep reading it. When you get to the final part you'll see that the book's finish is just ridiculous. If you read this book -that I don't recommend- you'll know why.
2,Too much rant mixed with too little good writing,"Had to stop reading about 1/3 of the way through. Love a good adventure and am no fan of managed care nor of HMOs, but this book is overwhelmingly preachy and hits one over the head instead of using good writing technique to make a point within a believable story line. Might make an interesting editorial but not a good book."
4,Definitely entertaining and fun,"This was my first Michael Palmer book, and I have to say that it was exactly what I was in the mood for! It was suspenseful, interesting, and had very likeable characters that I found myself rooting for. It wasn't too long, and the tone wasn't too serious or dark. It had some crime/violence without going over the top like a lot of thrillers tend to do. There was a little mystery, a little action, and a little romance-everything that makes a story fun and entertaining. I will definitely be reading more of Michael Palmer's books soon."
2,No more Palmer books for me,"I've read a bunch of Palmer books, and it seems like each one gets worse. This one is a greatly exaggerated indictment of managed care and promotion of a national single payer system (a concept which I basically agree with). The story line is same old same old -- although, admittedly, an exciting page turner (which is the only reason I give it a 2, rather than a 1)."
1,Try something else,"I found this book pretty boring. The beginning is OK, but then it's just one cliché after another. To top it off the author tries to sound as if he has any idea about serious health care issues, but in fact he is clueless. The premise: HMO - evil (they want to kill people), doctors - good (they want to save people) is overly simplistic and maybe good for a kindergartner. I wish he'd stick with the mystery plot. I recommend you try something else."
1,DO NOT RENT!,"The high stars that this has gotten was obviously due to reviews written by people involved in the film. We just wasted 4 bucks on something that I could have shot with my dogs over a weekend with my camcorder. We made it about ten minutes in, but the production and acting was so bad, we just shut it off. Yuck!"
1,Video Use,"I look at m any movies and purchase many movies as well. But this movie was horrible, first off they used a video camera for filming and itis very obvious. The actress seem like they are just feeling their way through the scenes. It is annoying to purchase a movie with a greatcover and find that it is purely video,. You have been warned if you purchase the movie."
1,Way too Confusing,"I'm not a fan of a movie that has so many characters in it that you can't keep track of who's who. There are too many scenes where the girls are showed crying, or thinking, or engaging in some sort of creative work, with a song playing and no interaction with people or anything taking place. I'm not a fan of that type of film making. It's like they just use that technique to fill up time. Boring."
3,Low-Budget,"An amateur film made film.If you like your films fast paced, with a clearly defined story and even clearer supernatural element, don't get this. I am a horror buff and I will give even low budget films a chance. But this one could have used a little more work."
2,REALLY!??!,"Come on...REALLY? Rented this movie because of all the high ratings, we figured half way through they were left by the filmakers friends since the movie was really amateurish. I felt like I was watching the a film school final. On the other hand it did have potential."
2,"With an additional $500,000 this film would have been pretty good","This is a three star story, with a three star score, played out by one star actresses against one star production values. The direction gets two and half. Schmidt is clearly competent but still has a lot to learn.Is it scary? No. There are some genuinely great moments and good scenes but bad acting, cheap effects and poorly mixed audio prevent it from being effective.It's a real shame that mindless crap gets the big hollywood money while smart, thoughtful films like this one have to make do with papermachet and shadow puppets."
2,earnest failure,this was a small shoe string budget independent movie which I didn't care for but I will say that the makers of this movie were trying to deliver as good a film as possible given they're apparent resources
5,Eine unheimliche ausgezeichnete CD,"In dieser CD, Nana bietet uns 12 sehr schOne Lieder an, das letzte auf Griechisch. Die Melodien, die Worte und Nanas Stimme sind sehr sehnsuchtlich und wunderschOn. The level of German used in the lyrics can by anyone understood be who elementary German studied has... Ha, ha! The Greek song was recycled from Nana's 'Spiti mou spitaki mou' album and is called 'Vale ton ilio synoro' which means 'Place the sun as your ally'. The title of the album means 'Songs that love writes' and it has a nice mix of adaptations anD 'real' German songs. This is one of the most hauntingly beautiful albums of Nana's career."
4,An examination of the evolution of the public's view on Indians,"This is the only book I am aware of that examines how the press shaped public perception of Indians. The press changed from writing of the the savage menace to a more sympathetic view of a doomed way of life.This book is an excellent background source for reading of any tribe as it helps to explain how the American public (and hence its leadership) saw the ""Indian problem."""
5,Outstanding,"On par with the best from Autechre and Squarepusher, ""The Need for a Sky"" offers a refreshing relief from the vast wasteland of electronic garbage... This disc explores many different ideas in music... ""Taiga"" and ""Comfort"" are especially good examples of this. This disc shows more maturity over the last release ""Catharsis"".I look forward to the work of this wonderful composer..."
1,"Very, very poor","This represents all that is soulless and wrong in music today, especially country. Adding a steel guitar for 2 bars does not a country song make. Moreover, he fails to even perform good songs, regardless of genre. You don't have to be Hank Williams, Sr. incarnate to be good. Uncle Tupelo mixed rock and country beautifully; Keith Urban does not. Nashville needs to really reexamine itself. Fake, lame, teeny-bopper garbage."
4,One of the Best CD's I Bought This Fall,"I love this CD. The songs make you feel as if you are reading someone's journal -- it's almost a diary of a relationship -- the ups and downs, the joys and the pain. Keith definitely sings about topics that I, as a 32 year old man, want to hear. His guitar playing is great, his songwriting is real, and you can hear the truth in his voice. This is a CD that I plan to give to friends. If you like Jackson Browne, Dixie Chicks, Merle Haggard, James Taylor, Jewel, Lucinda Williams.....you will like this cd. I read the review that the Amazon music reviewer gave -- I'm sorry, but I don't think he listened to the same album I did -- I think he quickly scanned his copy and moved on. This is an album to be savored -- to listen to over and over, and find new nuances each time you do."
5,Absolutely Spectacular!,"This CD has to be one of the best that I've ever owned. I don't think I've ever had a CD where I liked every single song on it. A few have come close, but not as close as this one. Of the 12 tracks on this album, none disappoint. My favorite was track 7, ""You're the Only One."" Keith Urban has a voice that grabs at me and makes me want to sing along on all the songs, even though I admit that I probably shouldn't since, unfortunately, my voice clashes with his. Really, this is great music, well worth the cost, and definitely good listening."
4,Keith Urban can do no wrong!,What can I say? It's Keith Urban! The man is hot and he can sing. The album is really good. I had heard some of the songs before but didn't realize they were on this album. I thought Golden Road was his first album. But for the Grace of God and Where the Blacktop Ends are two of the best songs on the album but they are all good. If you are a Keith Urban fan this album is a must!
4,Very Good,This is the only modern country act that I really like.Keith is extremely talented.This record manages to be mainstream and innovative at the same time.Impressive debut.
4,THE BEST LIVE recording of The Specials,"The tracks of The Selector are not all that good. ""Too much pressure"" is OK, but the rest are indicative of a band that never jelled as a group.But the second half of the disk...This was the Specials at the very top of their game. A tight group that was still having fun onstage. This is a glimpse into one of the briefest windows of musical excellence; a year earlier, they were a bit sloppy. Shortly after this recording they began drifting apart. Terry sings ""Concrete Jungle"" here, making one wonder why he didn't on the LP. And ""Long shot kick de bucket""/""Skinhead Moonstomp"" is one of my fovorite moments in music; much better here than the 12"" B-side version."
4,An Interesting Side Project,"If you're a fan of Ron Jarzombek's guitar work from Watchtower, then this is an excellent investment for you. There's a lot to love about this CD. It's very experimental in nature but it doesn't lack in the guitar virtuoso department. The only reason why I wouldn't give it five stars is because it's not exactly the type of album you listen to from beginning to end. I would say that the average fan probably either has their favorite tracks that they skip to or they listen to it in sections as their mood changes.No matter how you listen to it, though, you're definitely going to find something to like about it."
3,Spastic Indeed,"If you like instrumental ripping music, this disc is for you. There is no doubt these musicians are skilled and can play at lighting speeds with ease, but being bombarded by constant blazing notes and odd time signatures wears me out. Most of the tunes are rock/metal influenced. This is not something I play often because you need to be in a certain mood before the onslaught begins. In addition, the audio is not of the highest quality because parts were recorded on a 4-track.The disc is available for $15 through Ron Jarzombek's website. Add another star if you can handle intense shreds."
3,Weird Western,"Ken Maynard did not make traditional Westerns for Universal - in fact, he frequently clashed with studio bosses over the bizarre nature of his storylines. ""Honor of the Range"" (1934) has Ken in a dual role as the town sheriff and his weak-willed twin brother. Good stunt work and solid Universal production values make this one of Maynard's better efforts. However, if you want to see the cowboy star at his most outlandish, check out ""Smoking Guns."""
4,Voyages writing portfolio is a stationary kit,"I had been looking for a scrapbook/journal type album to preserve photo memories from a recent vacation. This portfolio is made of heavy cardboard covered with textured blue paper and latched closed with a wrap-around cloth belt with metal clasp. The inner front left side pocket is large enough to hold 8x10 papers and contains ten 8x5.5 postcards. The right side holds a removable writing pad with 100 lined sheets. It was not what I was looking for but I liked it so much, I decided to keep it anyway."
1,?????????????????,It is here that we ask ourselves if the chair is a rock/grunge type band or Mozart's helpersROCK LIKE YOU DID IN YOUR FIRST 2 ALBUMS PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
5,The best Rock,"I think that Silver Chair Rocks! Ana song is the best because it really describes a battle with anarexia. Reader, buy this cd it RULES!"
3,So-so,"Some good songs on this one to give a nice ride, but it feels like its dragging a little somewhere in the middle. If you're looking for an entry from rock to a more grunge sound not a bad choice, even though I don't consider this grunge I've heard it been called that, but if you've become accustomed to the sounds of the Melvins or Nirvana then this isn't a buy that you need to make unless you're looking for something new and don't usually worry about forking over the cash."
5,Deserves way more then 5 stars!!,"This is the best cd i have ever bought. A MUST BUY. you are missing out on great talent if you dont buy it. Daniel Johns (lead man in silverchair) did an amazing job, you really need to but this cd!"
5,BUY IT NOW!,"As a long time listener of Silverchiar, I feel this is their best album yet, it really shows Daniel John's writing and vocal skills, you can really see how the band has matured since their debut ""frogstomp"". I feel that everyone who hears this album will fall in lovw with it as quickly as I did, they have a very smooth sound and can play veried types of music. I highly recommend it! (Plus daniel Johns is a sexy bitch! )"
4,truly expresses the pain of eating disorders,"I bought this CD on a whim, having had it recommended by a friend. However, after the first time of listening to the beautiful and haunting voice of Daniel Johns, I could not put it down. It is refreshing to hear a CD in which so much of the artists soul is present. The lyrics are incredibly powerful, especially on tracks ""emotion sickness"" and ""ana's song"". In addition, ""anthem for the year 2000"" is a rousing song which demands to be cranked up. Neon Ballroom is a CD that every person should have in their collection."
5,We are the youh,"I've been a fan of silverchair's since they first released ""Frogstomp"" and have been a hardcore fan since. I heard the song ""Do You Feel The Same"" on a free CD and was a bit weary of their new musical direction, but after hearing a promo of the album I went out and bought it immediately. And just a few small days ago I witnessed it all live on stage and it worked so well- everyone loved it. The slower songs like Emotion Sickness and Miss You Love work so well with the heavier songs like Spawn Again and Satin Sheets. It's emotional but not draining and I love it!"
3,Depends on what you like.,"The problem with Silverchair is this: lyrics. Time and time again (and it's getting worse), Silverchair's lyrics get faker and faker. They just don't sound right. ""We are the youth; we'll take your facism away""? Come on. What are they trying to come off as? If the answer is know-nothings, they have succeeded. Now, the negative being said, where Silverchair shines is music. Everything from the carefully arranged instrumental parts, to the haunting, beautiful, or at least melodies with vaule to them... this album delivers, generally, about as much as their last two albums. Which is not to say that it is the same, but it isn't much noticeably ""better"". But how do you beat some of that old stuff? ANYWAY, the music is good, the lyrics... well, they're not good. Is it worth it. Depends on what matters to you."
4,Cool but should be more Heavey,"A great albun, but frakshow and frogstomp is way better. It should be more heavey!!!"
1,Sense of maturity? Give me a break.,"This is a sophmoric effort (albeit their third album) by a bunch of graduating high school seniors. The first single -- ""Anthem"" -- lets this be known with such idiotic lyrics as ""we are the youth; we don't want your fascism."" They try to be deeply political but come off as know-nothings. Want some good tunes with smart social commentary? Try Rancid, Chumbawumba, Blur or The Specials. (Unfortunately, Silverchair has a cut on the forthcoming Clash Tribute CD - yech.) Can I give this disk zero stars?"
3,Silverchair matures but is it good?,"these is no doubt a great cd, but as a huge silverchair fan i have to say, where did all the raw emotion, and hard dietorion guitair go? silverchair is at it's best when daniels got the distorion pedal hooked up to his guitair. as a musician my self, in a band we play a lot of silverchair covers and with this albulm i was hoping for some more, but for some odd reason the band didn't have a lot og graet songs like slave, israil's son, pure massacre, freak, no assotion..."
5,This CD is the best!,This CD is the best CD i have bought in a long time. The lyrics mean something and to a young artist like me this gave me a overload of insperation to write songs and poems and express more of my feelings. The songs are awesome and powerful.They have a good beat and some are sad and morbid but hey if you like that kind of stuff and If you like good quailty rock music this is the cd for you. Good musicans music should very from all kinds of styles not just stay the same. SilverChair can go from soft and mellow to a head banging hard rock sound which is really what i look for in bands and music today. I give this CD 5 outstanding stars! :-)
2,Difficult album,"Life must be hard on Silverchair. The young band could have settled into the role of Nirvana Jr and rapidly stagnate. This band has other plans and if one listened to tracks like ""Cemetary"" on their previous album ""Freakshow"" - you see the inspiration for this album.Silverchair continue the progression towards more emotional rock on this album but not without difficulty. Daniel Johns sounds more unsure of himself having shed most of the Cobain croon. Songs alternate between the new softer emotional stuff to some rather dull grunge. In sum, the band is going through a transitional phase giving hints of where they really want to be but are not quite there. At the same time they try to hold on to their past roots but to no avail.Unfortunately this album is less consistent than ""Freakshow"" which was in itself rather uninteresting. Most tracks miss their target. Its hard to fault the young band for trying and I think that their best years are ahead."
5,Silverchair is Amazing!,"My friend made a mix for me, and the minute Ana's song came on I was hooked! I went out and bought the CD the following week. All I really have to say is wow! There is not one track on this CD that I don't love. I went to Israel to visit fam last year and my friends were like, ""Hey which band is this?"" I told them it was Silverchair and they all loved them. Now Silverchair is widely known threwout all the main cities in Israel. That's how good Silverchair is! The best tracks: Black Tangled Heart, Emotion Sickness, and Ana's song."
3,Welcome to the Neon Ballroom,"For me the stand out song on this album was the gorgeous ballad Miss You Love (the reason I bought the album really). Oddly enough, it's the only song on the album mixed by Kevin Shirley. Which is a shame. But following close behind in my favourite stakes were Ana's Song and Anthem for the Year 2000. I found Spawn absolutely horrible, and Black Tangled Heart very uneven. Dearest Helpless, Do You Feel the Same, and Point of View hold up very well, and the rest of the album ambles into averageness. All in all not a bad album. When it's good, it's very good."
1,Silverchair...,"Neon Ballroom has some of the most interesting music I've ever listened to. However, this is probably the most depressing CD I own. Its good, in small doses..."
3,"They're good, but too many fillers!","This CD has some great stuff on it. Many of their songs are indepth with some interesting messages. I love the way they play, different from almost anything else I've heard. However, their biggest weakness is aside from the good songs, they're a bunch of fillers (70% of the CD). It seems like they were rushed by the record companies, because this CD had good potential!"
1,generic alterna-grunge,This is tripe that will appeal greatly to white suburban kids eagerly awaiting the same old thing.
4,Raaaaaaaaa,This album is a definite must do for your cd collection when you want something that is easy to listen to it has that capability and more this is a really good side to them and it shows off their talent really well. I think that this is the way that silverchair have tried to be before but not quite succeeded any way this is best silverchair album by far
5,this album stunned me when i first heard it,"The first time i heard silverchair, i was shocked by the power of Daniel Johns' emotions. i have never heard a band like silverchair. every song on the cd is fabulous and i can't live without it."
5,Neon Ballroom - a really great album,"I thought that Silverchair's Neon Ballroom was REALLY good. I thought that it had a nice combo. of punk music and heart-felt lyrics. I especially liked how they added some unusual musical instruments into some of there songs such as piano and harp. Over all, I think that Neon Ballroom is one of the best albums that I have ever bought."
5,This Cd is very positive and I think you all will enjoy it,"Silverchair is a great band with alot of potential to make them one of the biggest bands in the world.Not only is this a great CD but it also tells stories to go along with life.It makes you think of every day life and how some people are always more fortunate then others.This cd is very open to the idea of life.As people get older they realize what they did good or bad in their life and this CD can relate.The Anthem to the year 2000 is a great song that tells about how and what it will be like and what you can look forward to.This CD has helped me think and become positive about my life.And with it, it makes me think of the days past and the days to come.I love this Cd and it is my personal favorite and I think that everyone who needs a positive influence in their life should listen to it.Thanks."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!,"IF YOU HAVN'T GOTTEN THIS CD YET, GO OUT AND BUY IT. IT IS THE BEST. ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT AND WELL DONE. AND OF COURSE DANIEL AND BEN ARE SOOO CUTE!"
4,A good cd!,"THis album is well put together. I like Anthem 2000, it's pretty werid but it's a good song."
3,Ok,im gonna be honest. this cd was a let down. sure its beutiful and pretty. and if thats what your looking for... then this is for you. but if your getting this cd expecting it to rock like the old ones.... your wasting your money. this is too passive for me.
4,Very romantic!,"Some of these songs can take your breath away, 'Miss You Love' and 'Ana's Song' are some of the best 'slow songs' I have heard for the past few years, well, not as good as 'Black Hole Sun'. However, some other songs do let the album down, which is a shame. They have matured as a band, roll on next album."
3,Neon View,"I'm really kind of disappointed after hearing this album not because it was a bad album. It really depends on your taste. If you're the typical hard rocking dude then this is not the album for you. All the songs were written by Johns based on his personal thoughts,experiences and observations so you could really call it a John's album. One outstanding song I like is Ana's song which is musically and lyrically done well and very original. All in all I would rate this album second to Frogstomp. The bottom line is that if your musical taste is more on the hard rocking stuff then be prepared to be disappointed but if you prefer pop and ballads then go ahead and buy the album."
3,"Sparse Brilliance, ton of potential","We have to remeber that Silverchair is a band with a median age of 20. That being said this third album is a very hopeful example of things to come for this band. I have no other Silverchair albums but Neon Ballroom, although I know their other work. Neon Ballroom is very raw, emotionally and the first track ""Emotion Sickness"", is such an amazing, sad, desperate and beautiful song... that I hoped to hear more of it's originality and true courage... but while ""Ana's Song"", ""Spawn Again"", and ""Miss you love"" have their shades of brillaince, I felt most of the album did not live up to the potential of the first 5 tracks. But it's a very good album none the less. And I am looking forward to Daniel Johns' and the rest of Silverchair's exploration into their very core for songs that go further and further into their incredible artistic potential."
3,SOME GOOD SONGS...,"I really enjoy FROGSTOMP...But like FREAK SHOW, NEON BALLROOM got some songs that really don't make the album good...SATIN SHEETS, SPAWN AGAIN and DEAREST HELPLESS are some of best songs Silverchair recorded...But NEON BALLROOM got many mellow moments that really don't shine... If you want SILVERCHAIR look for FROGSTOMP!!!"
5,5 Stars all the Way,"Neon Ballroom is the most emotional album I've ever listened to. Daniel Johns' crackly vibratto sends chills down your spine as he sings about his battles with paranoia, depression and anorexia and carefully handles each string of his sincerely screaching guitar. Chris Joannou gives ""bass-player"" a new meaning as his grungy strums take over the undertones. Ben Gillies complicates typical beats to fit the dramatic cry of the background orchestra. At age 20, the boys of Silverchair have given teenage angst a new meaning. Another reviewer commented, Silverchair's albums just keep getting better and it's true. Right now, they are working on a new album and, unfortunetly for them, it will be hard to compare to this brilliant masterpiece. I, like many other listeners, have gotten great satisfaction out of Neon Ballroom and I highly recommend it; to anyone!"
5,SILVERCHAIR RULES!!!,"I HAVE LOVED SILVERCHAIR SINCE THEY FIRST CAME OUT. THE SONGS HAVE HAD SO MUCH OF AN EFFECT ON MY MUSICAL STYLE AND PREFRENCES. DANIEL JOHNS IS A GREAT POET AND AN AWESOME GUITARIST. THIS IS THE BEST CD OF ALL THREE AND THEY ARE ALL MY FAVORITE CD'S. LISTEN TO THIS CD AND CONCENTRATE TO THE LYRICS AND THE SOUND OF THE INSTRUMENTATION, IT WILL TAKE YOU AWAY. I LOVE THIS CD AND I LOVE SILVERCHAIR!!!"
5,Absolutely the best CD ever!!!,The latest cd from silverchair is their best. The songs are the reflection of Daniel's life in the past year or two. I loved their previous CD's but this one truly rocks.
5,Beautiful Blend of Instruments,"I never really paid much attention to Silverchair before I saw the video for ""Ana's Song"" on MTV, and I was totally mesmerized. I bought the album on a whim (I usually check out other song samples before I buy an album) and completely fell in love. The blend of instruments is awsome and unique. My favorite songs are ""Miss You Love"" and ""Ana's Song."" I totally recommend this Cd!!!"
4,Its alright......just like freak show,"i liked the cd a lot but i didnt think it was as good by far as frogstomp....freak show dissapointed me and neon ballroom...not too much better. ""Anthem for the year 2000"" was one of their best songs yet...and ""Ana's Song"" was awsome, but they went soft. not the same lyrics and such..."
5,A MUST FOR EVERY ROCK FAN OUT THERE!,"What can I tell you? Silverchair did it for the 3rd time, They made a CD that makes you go WOW! The CD is packed with awsome songs in the uniqe style that only Silverchair can write. If you don't have this CD then buy in now damn it! This version of the CD is more rare from the normal one you might find in your local store, This one has two CD in the box! This item will get rare someday so buy it now."
5,My friend can't write this so I'll write it for her,"I have a friend who loves Silverchair and after her making me listen to it, I love them too.The songs are very personal and I give Daniel Johns credit for writing them in such an emotional way.My friend and I are practically the only ones in school who even know who they are, and that's sad. Everybody else is to busy doing their little 'N Sync/Backsreet Boys thing that they forget about songs that are written from the soul and a band that actually plays their own insruments. If you really appreciate good music then get off your computer and go buy this C.D. NOW!"
4,Another Solid Chair,"I discovered this album about a year after it came out and I have to say this album is really freaking good. A little over-produced in section, but an excellent offering from a couple of 20 year olds. Songs like Ana's Song, Anthem, and Miss You love show a stark contrast between how light and dark this album is, especially when combined with other instruments. These guys have alot of talent and continue to show what they are made of. Pick up this album, it is well worth your while."
4,Very impressive,"I still remember my disdain for this band back in 1995, and their second album didn't help any. Though I respected what they were doing at their age, I was really bothered by their tired post-grunge sound. I recently heard this album though, and was in complete awe. I immediately lost my ""I wish I was Kurt Cobain"" view of Daniel Johns and realized what talented musicians they really are. Any band who can make that kind of evolution from songs like ""Tomorrow"" and ""Abuse Me"" to any given track off of this album is nothing short of amazing. I honestly believe that Silverchair may rank with Tool and Radiohead with their next release or so. In any case, this and Diorama truly deserve a listen, whatever you may have thought of them before."
5,Just plain awesome.,"Of course, if you've already listened to the other SC albums, you might think this one isn't as good because most of the songs are too 'soft'. It's true, they are soft, but they still rock in their own way. You just have to appreciate them. That was my case. At first, my listening was very limited, but eventually it expanded, and every song seemed powerful.This is a great album, don't miss it."
3,This is not what it makes out to be.,"The CD is a big letdown to all their fans. This CD contains 2 rock songs, not even as hard as Frogstomp. And all the others are just O.K. I feel partly that I have wasted 30.00 on a CD. I would listen to it before you buy it."
5,Very good cd,"First of all you should buy this cd based on the music, not on the looks, because it sounds like some people are too interested in the way D. Johns looks than what the music sounds like. Anyways this is a very good cd, if anyone is interested in buying a good cd than this is it. Believe me you won't be wasting your money."
5,"Hey, I'm Supposed To Hate These Guys!!","What the HELL happened? These Aussie kids took a break and came back with an AMAZING album packed with great songs, inspired creativity, huge melodies, and more variety than a petting zoo. I used to hate these guys for being wanna be grungers, but when I heard ""Ana's Song"" and ""Anthem . . .,"" my curiosity was peaked. If you didn't like Silverchair before, try 'em on for size now. This is one of the coolest albums since Radiohead's ""OK Computer."""
4,A Rarity: An Album You Can Listen to ALL THE WAY THROUGH,"Having bought Silverchair's first two albums I feel I am a bit of a fan of theres. As with many bands you seem to get bored of the same old routine. Not this time. Silverchair has matured more ways than one. The album begins with the ""eery"" piano-stylings of David Helfgott (Shine) on the song ""Emotion Sickness"". It then goes into the song ""Anthem for the..."", which blows my mind how much that song just ROCKS. The 5th song on the album, ""Miss You Love"", is one of the best ballads of the 90's. What a beautiful song. This album isn't for everybody though. It's pretty much for all the die-hard fans to either like their new work or not. Silverchair (on this album) is saying, if you don't like this, then you should get off our fan list because things are only going to change."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap - only 1/2 of unit heats after 4 months","VERY disappointed, product was sometimed difficult to rotate, now won't even heat up properly. Poor customer service. Bought this one after the ""less expensive"" unit did not last, expect much more for the price. Only used about twice a month...very sorry I purchased it."
2,inferior craftmanship,inepensive part that is now broken is not available so I can fix it will cause me to buy another waffle maker.Why are these parts unavailable from the manufacturer.Our society should not be a dosposable society.I want to fix this and not throw it in a landfill.
4,Love it!,"This makes breakfast so much fun...when I have the grandkids over for breakfast, they even want to help make the waffles. I like mine so much, I'm giving 7 of them as Christmas gifts this year."
1,Worthless Turd,"I received this product as a gift, heaven forbid I would've had to spend money on this defective hunk of junk! I have had this waffle iron, excuse me, this ""waffle plastic"" for just under a month, 28 days to be exact. Yes that's right, a measly 28 days. As soon as I took it out of the box I knew I shouldn't get my hopes up. Other than a few screws, the majority of it is plastic and I felt as if the handle would fall off just from gravity alone. I would have much rather the handle snapped off on me like I hear most do; however, mine just stopped working on me altogether. The first few waffles you make will cause your room to fill with a horid aroma almost as if there is a chemical coating on the inside of the ""iron."" I'm not going to lie I did have some tastey waffles while this inferior product lasted. Quite frankly though, I poop out things of better quality than this waffle maker."
2,"Good results, still it stopped working at 6 months","We purchased this unit from Target. It has done a passable job of making waffles. Doesn't provide an even browing, but seems to cook the waffles through. It also made blueberry waffles without problem. The only drawback: six months after purchase, the unit stopped working. No heating. We're going to try and take advantage of the 1 year warranty, though we don't have the receipt any more."
3,didn't work.,"I was really looking forward to this waffle iron,but when it came it didn't work.I tryed everything i made sure I wasn't the only that tryed to make it work(just incase I was doing something wrong)nothing.the seller was great through,they didn't jerk me around at all.They were fast to respond to me about trying to give me some tips to get it working & when all else failed they just gave me my money back.I will order from them again,I mean it's not like they sold it to my on purpose."
1,Only a 1 Star because 0 was not an option!,"Bought today, tried to make a waffle tonight - ate pancakes on the grill instead. This piece of junk - and I really mean junk was on sale for $40.00 and I will be getting my $40 bucks back tomorrow! Please do yourelf a favor and read all the 1 star reviews as they are 100% true and had I read them first, I certainly would not have bought this item. Flimsy, ready light does not work properly, lock does not work well, and the unit wobbles and does not stay level. Oh and for the record the two waffles I attempted to make pulled apart and hence stuck to the top and bottom of the unit and made it very difficult to clean and repackage! ... and yes, I used oil to lightly grease both sides! Buyer beware."
2,Great waffles right up until it broke because of poor design,"We bought this waffle iron at a local store less than a year ago. We probably used it 20 times. It heated well and made great waffles, but the handle came off. Nothing actually broke, but there is no effective way to retighten the handle due to a very poor design. I believe the stress of turning the handle to flip the waffle as recommended is responsible for loosening it a little bit at a time. Since the waffle maker is designed to be turned this way, I see no way it could be avoided. I would recommend looking for something sturdier."
1,Not Sturdy Enough,"While this product makes EXCELLENT waffles, the handle breaks and there is no way to repair it. I've been through two. It's a shame, since the rest of the design is great."
1,Defective and not worth the price,"My first Bella Cucina Belgian Waffle Iron lasted just over a year (used two or three times a month) and then it quit working--likely the thermostat. Yesterday I purchased a new one with a slightly different design, and today I'm returning it because it doesn't heat properly, and the signal light is erratic. If you desire heavy, soggy, barely browned waffles, and a signal light that goes on and off regardless of whether or not the waffle is cooked, this is the waffle iron for you. As for me, I'm going shopping for a different brand."
1,PUre china Junk,I am returning the second of two of these cheap waffle makers with a pretty high price.The off and on and ready lights go wild thru a cook cycle and youcan't tell if done or not.the latest one was defective out of the box. the handle will not disengage from it's cradle.
1,So irate!!,"The description say lots of padding in the footbed...well it DOESN'T HAVE ANY! Secondly,the size I ordered said 71/2 medium...well this shoe is a narrow! The shoe style is beautiful! And like the other review it is hard to get on...So mad I have to pay shipping back-after the shoe was described in an dishonest way from [...] ! I will never trust [...] AGAIN!"
1,Should Not Be Called Romance,"Rhys ap Owian and Isolde are a perfect match... they're both hateful people and deserve each other. No one but a ruthless, unredeemable character like Rhys, (although at some point in the book, we're told he's really a good man) could stomach a spoiled, immature woman like Isolde. Aside from having some artistic ability, she mostly cries, bemoans her wanton lack of morals, is rude to the servants and screams at Rhys.Oh, yeah. This reviewer forgot. When a man and woman constantly yell that they hate each others guts, it's called Romantic Conflict.With these despicable characters (not to be confused with a hero and heroine) at the center of the story, the plot is immaterial, and the conclusion is a who-cares. It also doesn't matter if the medieval setting was accurate. This reviewer was forced into scan mode much of the time and groaned in agony the rest.For a story with warmth, complex characters, good sex scenes and lyrical writing, READ ANY OTHER BOOK."
4,Fun pant,"A fun pair of pajama pants that always makes us laugh whenever they are worn. The color faded some, and the length shrunk after washing, but that was ok as they were a little long to begin with."
5,His best to date.,"The selections on this cd are great. A great mixture of classics and new songs. This one is not to be missed, possibly the best cd he has done so far. I love it and will recommend it to anyone who will listen."
2,Big City Rhythms,Very disapointed! Vocals were much too soft. I found myself straining to hear his wonderful voice and not just enjoying the total composition. jp
1,Am I the only one who hates this CD?,"I have all of Feinstein's other recordings. This one I bought, then gave away because it was so disappointing. The music overpowers his voice in many songs. I dislike the song selections. And I miss the sound and style of the Feinstein recordings that led up to this one. My favorite CDs are ""Isn't It Romantic?"" and ""Nobody But You."""
1,"I agree with ""Am I the only one?""","No, you're NOT the only one! I, too, disliked this album very much. I am disappointed in it for many reasons, including: poor selection of songs, the way Michael's voice was recorded, and just a general lack of ""verve"" that energized some of his other albums, like ""Nice Work If You Can Get It."" Now THERE'S a great CD. If you're considering buying ""Big City Rhythms,"" don't! Spend your money on ""Nice Work If You Can Get It."" It's infinitely better."
2,Not too helpful for a beginner,"As a beginner, I found this instructional video to be too vague. Ms. Glass obviously has a lot of art training so her projects look nice when finished. However, she mentions cutting the paint with thinner, but gives no guidelines. And ""tinting a glaze"" whatever that entails. She gives no tips on picking a color scheme which is something most newbies need help with. Techniques are a little out of date. What she does with rags and sponges can now be done with special rollers. I also found the resolution of the images poor and had difficulty seeing a finished pattern well. Some guidance on where to find the products she used would have been nice. Overall, this was not a very helpful video. Sorry."
1,For smokers only.,"This powerful smelling cologne generally turns people off when I wear it. My co-worker who happens to be a smoker told me the smell is so strong that he can even smell it when he smokes outside the building. From deduction, it must be a colonge for smokers only."
5,WOMEN ADORE IT!,"This is my nighttime cologne. I use X-Centric by Dunhill during daytime excursions. This has a scent that grabs you. It's very unique, like all Dunhill scents, and I just love it. My daughter LOVES when I wear it, and ladies want to get closer to me when they smell me. It's just good stuff."
5,Must have design resource,"This book is a must have resource for architects, landscape architects, and interior designers. The book covers appropriate sizes, heights, and clearances for all ages of children and all types of environments. Anyone designing a school, hospital, or even a playground will benefit greatly by adding this book to his or her library. The information is brought to you in such a cleverly thorough manner that you can tell it is written from the heart, by a mom herself."
4,Interesting and very Informative,Great when thinking about the safety of your child in a new space. Provides standards for child's environments
2,Obviously faulty thinking on Iraq situation by author,"At one point the author, Feldman, talks about how the USA should have just replaced Saddam with someone more benevolent and not gone to war with Iraq. Feldman, just how would we have done that? Saddam was very determined to keep his postion in Iraq as leader. He even provenly employed doubles of himself to thwart any attempted assassination overthrow of him by plotters. Also, Saddam killed over a million of his own Iraqis amd terrorized close to all of them while he was in power. Strong state you claim he had, huh? Sure! Terrorizing, national dictators often do manage to have strong states under their sway. Also, he sent SCUD missiles at Israel. Feldman, aren't you Jewish? He was bad for your Jewish cousins, if you are. Think about that for a while. Lastly, the USA has 350 million people. Iraq had around 23 million. We have a right to put ourselves before them in importance due to our much greater numbers."
5,Another Great CD By Cowboy Junkies,"Early 21st Century Blues is another great hit by Cowboy Junkies. The group has been together for 20 years when this album was recorded and they prove their sound and creativity is still fresh. Interestingly only two of the songs in this album is written by Michael Timmins. All the rest of the songs are by other artists including songs by Bruce Springsteen, U2, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Richie Havens and John Lennon. By far I feel the most interesting of all the songs is their updated take of the John Lennon song ""I Don't Want To Be A Soldier"". When John wrote this song it was in protest to the Vietman War. The Junkies update the song with some new lyrics to protest the war in Iraq. Then sing the new lyrics in a Rap sound that is so different from what the Junkies have done before that takes you by surprise. And it totally works! A great addition to any music lovers collection and a must for any fan of Cowboy Junkies."
4,Early 21st century Blues,Anytime you listen to the Cowboy Junkies you are in for a treat. An inovative group. Truly expressive of thought and feeling. Music is always mellow and bluesy. Not for listening if you want to party.
4,Finally another great album!!,"I have been a great fan of the ""Junkies"". These last 4 years I gave up though. Their intimate music had grown to something difficult to listen to. Proberly a way not to repeat themself, but not a sucess.All that the Junkies need are good songs and not to find a different path. Wit this song, although mostly written by other artists, they found back the sound of the beginning, caution horses and of course the trinity sessions.Happy that they are back!"
3,Good but not Great,"I haven't listened to this one as much as I thought I would. All the numbers are at least OK, but to me none were memorable. There isn't a Misguided Angel or Powder Finger here. I am a fan of the Cowboy Junkies and I will listen to this many times, but I don't think it will be one of my favorites."
3,You almost produced a great album.,"Memo to Cowboy Junkies:You are not an R&B; band and your fans don't need you to do hip-hop, which doesn't fuse at all well with other musical forms anyway.Please stop doing that, apologize for the execrable John Lennon cut on your new CD and promise that you'll never do it again.Thanks,One of your fansPS) Loved the covers of ""One,"" ""You're Missing,"" ""No More"" and ""Handouts."" Lotta good stuff here. Just that one cut. Ack."
3,A heartwarming collaboration,"In my headline I haven't mentioned the musical value of this coupling of the Brahms and Dvorak Piano Quintets. I well remember the heartwarming May-December union of the aged Rubinstein with the up-and-coming Guarneris. They gave us a special fusion of keyboard wwisdom and fresh appeal, and we are lucky to have the fruits of their collaboration.However, it must be said that Rubinstein plays tentatively in both works -- you would be hard-pressed to find mellower performances. The Guarneri Qt. gives him the lead, and therefore moments arrive (as in the second movement of the Brahms) when forward motion comes to a halt while everyone waits for the pianist to gain a little vigor. Ensemble is good throughout, considering, but in the end these are readings for fond remembrance rather than competiiton with the best recordings of eithr work. Good sound."
1,Alpha Bombs Again,"I should have known something foul when I got the DVD ad discovered it was Alpha Video. The picture quality isn't very good at all. On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being unwatchable and 10 being remastered, I would give this DVD release a 5. They also superimposed their logo on the corner and freeze framed the opening title screen. If you want better quality, I recommend the Sinister Cinema release on Amazon.com (about the same price as Alpha's) because their release is not altered. I'm more a purist and I prefer to watch my movies unaltered."
1,Not worth it,"Like the other reviewer, the one I received would not load a CD. This was a Christmas gift request, but we are sending it back and plan to shop for another brand."
1,Unreliable. 2 different ones failed.,"The first one I received would not accept a CD. It would not go in the slot at all. I returned it via Amazon and the next one worked.The CD player did function, pitch control worked, etc. Kind of hard to figure out the controls though. Not well designed.Then, this one started skipping with almost all cds, and doing funny things. Taking really long to load, etc. This was after about 3 months of moderate use. (3-4 hours a day.)I would not recommend it. Not worth the trouble."
4,Rough + Tough,"As mentioned by other reviewers, these gloves offer little padding. This is not really a bad thing. Use a pair of wraps underneath these to provide some extra support.The lack of padding gives you a good feel of impact. Your hands will hurt a little at first, but as you progress, this is not an issue."
1,"Yes, I too was duped!!","Upon seeing this video package and getting excited to purchase ""Inside - Critical Review/Rare Footage"", I bit off and got sucked in too. The company that puts these misleading garbage compilations out should be banned by Amazon!Save your money and wasted expectations. Buy Gentle Giant and Floyd at Pompeii for nostalgia! Those are what these types of DVDs are all about.Long live early Genesis and King Crimson despite Bob Carruthers!"
1,"What Garbage!!! RUN, don't walk.","The reviews here have said quite well what the issues with this DVD are. What has not been mentioned (maybe because they didn't know) is the horrendous sync between audio and video. There are indeed full concert footage available on Ebay of many of the snipetts included in this mess which have complete and sync'd audio/video.DON'T BUY THIS DRIVEL!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!Wosre yet is the return policy Amazon has will not let me return opened boxes. Understandable, but sad nontheless. This DVD will now become an 18.00 target for my rifle."
1,A real steal,"Don't buy this DVD, you'll see some unknown expert telling you their opinion about early Genesis album. Some very short footage out of sync.You will have about 15 minutes on Tresspass, and 6 minutes on ""Selling England by the pound"", not a single word on ""Firth of fifth"" or ""The cinema show"" and 3 minutes on ""The lamb lies down on Broadway""Very bad product and it is a bad idea to see this crap on Amazon."
1,read the below review,"There's nothing I can say that wasn't said in the first posted review, but I would like to add one or two things. I was particularly annoyed when one of the ""critics"" actually analyzed Supper's Ready by playing the opening piano line. I KNOW HOW THE SONG GOES! I paid to see GENESIS play it, not some arrogant critic who thinks I care more about his opinion than watching supposedly unreleased Genesis footage. I felt particularly teased by the snippet shown from The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, because I think a live video from that tour would be worth it's own video release."
4,if you like techno or dance,"If you like techno or dance music, you would love what are you about to hear this! I have known him since he started TM network in Japan! He is a great musician and producer who has made popular music there. I would also recommend to listen TMN(TM network) albums as well as his solo albums."
3,I wish I'd gotten the faves,"I wish I'd gone on-line and purchased just my favorite tracks. This CD has every song in and out of the movie--even if the song is only 10 seconds long. I loved the movie and watched it so many times, so I thought I'd really enjoy the soundtrack. In reality, there are a few tracks with aren't really in my favorite genres. My faves make up only half of the tracks. I paid about $30 for it (which includes S & H), but I think I'd rate my tracks worth about $10: Great Big World, Critters Have Feelings, Red is Blue, Glow, Top of the Woods, Bounce, Hoodwinked Theme."
5,Love the movie - love the soundtrack,"The kids love the movie, so this was a natural addition to our library. Love reliving the songs and sounds!"
4,Its fun for the difficulty.,"I got it for the lavender town ""myth"" it is indeed a creepy town as well as music, it gives me headaches. But other than that, it is the best out of all Pokemon games, if you like difficulty. if you are a collector enjoy, and if you are just a pokemon enthusiast, enjoy!"
5,Margaret in Colorado,"This is my second pair of these capris. They are a bit stretchy for moving and comfort. The fabric is not as thin as the bliss capris. The back is flattering because of the rear pockets. These are great, very cute."
5,wascal wabbit,"monty python's rabbit may have too many teeth to keep its mouth closed orthe inclination of the upper lip a little lame but that's being nit-picking,it's a hilarious product."
5,Amazing,This is a very great item. I am very happy with this purchase. My wife couldn't be more thrilled with the rabbit.
4,Out of date but still useful!,This book is way out of date. It was recommended to me and I was very skeptical but if you are doing any sort of flash extension programming this book is worth it. Pretty much the best reason to buy it is for the JSFL(JavaScript Flash) reference in the back which is around 130 pages long. I withheld a star because there is a large amount of out of date material in the book. I gave it four stars because it really helped me get a handle on JSFL.
2,Overrated.,Dissapointing. I found that the stories lacked substance and style. Bland writing and bland reading. It was an effort for me to even complete the book (short as it is).
1,trite and worthless,"Ethan Canin has little to say and he spends a lot of time doing that. I have thrown away more interesting books. This is a poor, poor representative of any kind of decent writing going on today."
4,Exquisite rendering of dialogue,"This book was literary star Ethan Canin's first, a collection of short stories. I'm not a huge fan of short stories, but I'm a Canin fan, so I read it, and I'm glad I did. He's able to find compassion, loveliness, and surprise in the everyday lives of people. In the tale ""We Are Nighttime Travelers,"" a retired couple rediscovers their love for each other, and in ""Star Food,"" a boy protects the identity of someone stealing groceries from his parents' store. His writing is straightforward but exquisite and should have a wider appreciation among the reading audience.Emperor of the Air was written during Canin's years as a medical student in Boston, reminding me of parallels with another boy wonder, Daniel Mason, who likewise wrote a dense and mesmerizing novel (The Piano Tuner) while he was in medical school in San Francisco. That it's possible to write like this while fellow classmates are struggling just to keep from flunking out just stuns me."
5,I regret having loaned it out...,"...because now I'll never see it again. Stated simply, this is a work of art. The stories are inspired, and the characters are handled with such compassion and subtle understanding that it is difficult to believe that this is Canin's first published work. I agree with the critics that it is also his best. Having read _Of Kings and Planets_ recently, I feel that his artistic integrity may be suffering the pressure of compromise coming from his book deal, but it may also be that his subject matter is exhausted. I thought that _Blue River_ was all right, though it was certainly outshined by this gem. I agree with the other reviewers that ""We are Nighttime Travellers"" and ""Star Food"" are the kind of stories that stop time dead in its tracks. If he never writes a good book again, Canin should still be regarded as an exceptional success."
4,Simply Wonderful,"This is one book that by some stroke of luck I plucked from the shelf at the library. I am a fan of short stories, and usually favor simple ones, Raymond Carver comes to mind. The stories in this collection were poignant, heart-warming tales of family and love. I had never heard of this author before finding this book, but I will certainly look for something else that he has written."
5,Simply Brilliant,This is one of the richest collections of short stories I've ever read. The author's sparse yet deep writing style kept the pages turning. I highly recommend this book.
4,What i needed,This does the job for replacing the stock one. had a little trouble with the cover the hides the bolts. didn't want to line up good but did go on. all in all good for price.
2,mirror wasnt right,The mirror for the passenger side wasnt right. the mirror dosnt have the same curve as the stock one does so it doesnt pan out like a curve mirror justs shows straight behind. if anything it looks good on the truck but it does not serve its purpose...
2,Not necessarily so special,"If you already have this album on CD there isn't much point in buying this unless you simply can't live without it. I was extremely disappointed. I had thought it had a 5.1 soundtrack which is what the UK reviews indicated. Turns out that the Region 4 release only has PCM stereo and Dolby 2.0. Since the extras are thing you watch only once or twice, it is hard to recommend it. If you do decide to buy it, make sure your version has the 5.1 soundtrack!"
3,My sons B day present,Its a little hard for a 6 year old which is saying something cause he can play playstation2 games with no problem at all.
4,This Game's Awesome,"This new version of Mortal Kombat by Midway is a great arcade-style game for both experienced gamers and novices alike. I can still choose from popular fighters like Liu Kang, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Sonya Blade, Kano, Scorpion, or Sub-Zero. Each player has his/her own special moves. My favorite is Scorpion. He could teleport and fire a harpoon out of his hand. All the fighters have universal moves like the low kick, high punch, or the jump kick. There is also the ""Test Your Might"" challenge in which a fighter could earn bonus points, a ""secret"" duel with the Reptile, a chance to battle the gigantic Goro, and a final showdown with the mysterious Shang Tsung for the title of Supreme Mortal Kombat Warrior. This is a great game with excellent graphics, cool sound effects, and memorable characters from the classic tradition of Mortal Kombat."
2,This book is mis-titled,"This book has nothing to do with DESIGNING sql 2000 databases. It is simply an administrative guide to sql 2000 - Ch1: SQL Server Overview Ch2:Installing and configuring ch3: Scalability and Availability ch4:Designing and Creating dbs Ch5: Security ch6: Admininistration and Active Directory ch7: backup and recovery ch8: english query ch9: import/export data Ch10. Analysis server (olap) ch11:XML ch12: Replication ch13: programming tools Ch14: Performance Tuning The only chapter that has designing of dbs, is ch4 which mainly deals with filegroups, autogrow features, etc. Nothing about design. If you want a good admin book for 2000 buy this, otherwise look elsewhere for a desgin book."
2,not worth it,"The beginner CD was much better. This one contains a few games, but really lacks ways to learn the material it presents."
5,Structure and Chemistry of the Apatites...........,"This book is a must have for anyone researching the calcium phosphates. Nowhere else will you find such an extensive source of information on their preparation, structure, properties, transformations, spectroscopy, diffraction and other analyses. The section on biological and non stoichiometric apatites is extremely informative and the standard XRD patterns are a particularly useful reference. The section on apatite cements could do with updating."
1,Thumbs Down,The product could not be used with my rather standard setup ie MacOSX on Apple G5 with a Pioneer Burner. I was told by the vendor that I MIGHT get it to work by downloading software from the web. It turned out that the download was not a simple everyday variety but required a sophistication beyond my modest abilities. ( MY local Apple vendor and repair facility advised me not to use the download. They did not want to try it as well). The product vendor was reluctant to provide a refund. I might add that they dragged their feet for over about a two month period. Eventually they said they would provide a refund less a restocking fee. I put the issue in dispute with MC.
1,A Rare Miss By Desert Essence,"The only redeeming quality of this conditioner is the fresh lemon scent. This conditioner does nothing to condition your hair. It doesn't even help with detangling. In fact, my hair was less tangled when I completely skipped this conditioner and just used the coordinating shampoo. It might work for short hair that needs very little conditioning. I would steer clear."
5,Smells so good!,Smells so good and made continued to smell good once out of the shower. I like the size of the conditioner because it doesn't take up much room in the shower. Somehow this product made my naturally curly hair less frizzy and I LOVED that! Will buy again.
3,Not Great,I used the conditioner and shampoo. At first it seemed to work well but by the time I came down to a 1/4 of the bottle my hair was drying out. I would not buy this again.
3,good,This a great smelling product seem to work ok if you have short hair or fine it did not hold smell on long thick hair.
1,Fragrance Free Conditioner - Leaves everything to be desired,"I bought this product because I am scent sensitive and cannot tolerate most scents. From this perspective the product was great - no discernible scent; and that's where the positives end. I used this twice: once with the amount suggested - the results were: couldn't get a comb through my hair, and it felt dirty and looked dirty afterward. Second time I used more hoping that perhaps with my thick hair it was the amount that was the problem - no change - hair looked dirty, felt dirty, and couldn't get a comb through it.I can't recommend this product at all. Very disappointing!"
3,Not bad!,"I accidentally picked this up at the store instead of the Lemon Tea Tree shampoo. I liked the smell so I thought I'd try it anyway and I like it a lot! I have fine hair and a pretty oily scalp which forces me to wash my hair daily, but I think doing this can make the length of my hair really dry. This conditioner is moisturizing enough to make my hair silky smooth and shiny without weighing it down with excess oils. I might be imagining things but I think the lemon in this conditioner also helps to enhance my natural blonde highlights. It is a very thick conditioner so I use it generously to get my hair evenly coated, but it still rinses out easily. I'll definitely be ordering the shampoo that goes with this!"
4,Awesome looking Ringwraith!,"This ringwraith is very large and made quite well. He has a good blend of plastic robes and cloth robes. He comes with two swords. I tried putting the little one in its sheath , but the other sheath and the plastic robes made it really hard. In the end, after pushing to put it in, the sheath just broke off. I'm not too sad, though, because the big one is much better. He doesn't look so clunky with only one sheath. He does have trouble standing up, but I finally found a position that works. He needs to be leaning back just slightly. This is a must have for all LOR collectors."
4,Nifty,"Not a bad model for the die hard minion of evil fans. The Witchking is decked out in both rubber and cloth robes, giving a nice amount of detail to him. He's got both his Morgul Blade and his regular sword (though mine was a tad wobbly). He is also fully posable but I found that he has a hard time keeping his knees locked, so making him stand on his feet straight was impossible. My only thanks is that the rubber robes help act as a support."
5,See the fish?,"This thing is awesome. Has buttons for everything, you can leave it in the case the whole trip until you can dry it off. Took it scuba diving in Catalina, Monterey, and Mendocino and it worked great! Perhaps try photo's with and without strobe (it has the button to turn it off). The case seems to be very well made although I have yet to drop it to find out. I would recommend it to anybody who wants to take some cool water photos!"
3,Great for snorkeling not for diving,"I have the Canon sx20is. It is a great camera for pictures on land but too much work for pictures under water. I own a Sealife DC1000 which does a better job. Everything is already programmed in the camera. Just point and shoot, the filters adjust the colours automatically for green or blue waters so that you don't have to play with white balance etc, fish move pretty quick so does the people you dive with, with the Sealife Dc1000 or the new Dc1200. I can take video and 60 to 100 pictures during a one hour dive. With my Canon I may get 20 if I am lucky. Happy diving and enjoy underwater photography..."
5,MUCH BETTER THAN LAST 2006!,I was able to catch 2-3 of these in theaters and I've got to say they are a HUGE improvement from 2006's mediocre to horrible line-up. Also it's nice the 8 films to die for are being released in a pack w/ all 8 films instead of 7 films + you have to go buy the most popular one (The Abandoned) and pay extra for it.Special effects are tons better as are the plots and the acting. I have high hopes for 2008 after seeing these! Don't let the mess than was the 2006 horrorfest turn you off of these!
2,Waste of money,The first Horrorfest collection was the best. This set can't compare. These movies look like they were cheap budget films with bad actors. Don't waste your time or money.
1,Forget it!,Save your money. These films have little or no plot making them hard to follow. The acting is bad also.Whoever makes these films should really consider improvements.
4,5-stars if it were widescreen,"It looks like Amazon is only selling the set as 1.33:1 aspect ratio. If you are like me, and like widescreen, you should probably look elsewhere."
4,I've Listened again and again,"This is a great CD and I can't wait to get to London to see the show. The lyrics are real, funny, and true. The music is great! I find myself playing it all the time, and am planning a trip so I can see it onstage. Get this CD and listen to it- you will not regret the purchase."
5,Personals is worthy of revivals in all major theater venues,"Personals is one of the most imaginative and delightful musicals I've heard. I attended performances during the original run in New York and awaited this album for years. At last. And, a great recording as well. In particular, I found the songs written by Joel and Seth Friedman the highlights of the show. They have a great gift for melody and musical twists and turns abound. Coupled with an incisive wit and insight into human vulnerabilities, their songs hit their mark."
3,Pocket-sized Prayers,This is a collection of common-sense prayers for almost every occasion a teacher will encounter. It's small size makes it easy to keep handy for when the need arises.
2,slow order pull,The product is the product no matter where you get it.... it took over a week for this to even ship. I ended up having to do the 30 mile trip to town and buy them long before I received these.
2,Dewormwer tabs,The tabs was to big for the cats to swallow without getting us hurt. And I don't know if I would buy this tabs again.
5,perfect,My cat wasn't completely infected with worms but we did see a few of them one day. I ordered this and only gave her half a pill as directed. The worms were gone within a week! Now I have these extra pills with no cat needing them. It is very hard to get the cat to swallow the pill though. I wish they had a liquid option with a syringe.... would be much easier.
4,Cat Worms,I like the product overall..my cat had tapeworms and I ended up using these tablets for her. It was a little hard getting her to swallow them but other than that I believe it worked!
5,Works,This works great and fast. Much cheaper to purchase on-line than going to the Vet. I have several cats and gave to all of them. It worked right away and I'll use it again if the need arises.
4,Mix it with water...,"This product works. It's just very tricky to give it to my 4 cats. I have to crush the pills, mix it with water, and give it to them in a syringe."
1,Trade Winds Cat Tabs,"I am sorry but I find it outrageous to charge $20.00+ for 3 pills the size of aspirin for cats with tapeworms. This company knows how difficult it is to administer a pill to an average family pet cat! Yet charges a ridiculous price for there distasteful pill that cats won't eat. They rip off the cat owner. Petco, Centinella Feed and other pet depots/stores charge this horrible amount. These pet companies need to help the consumer in helping their feline family members control their parasitic infections at an affordable cost."
5,Great product,"Works fast, received the tabs quickly, very satisfied with my purchase. Happy Mom & happy fur babies what more can I ask for?!!"
1,INFO PURPOSES ONLY ... Make sure you order enough,"This product only contains 3 tablets in it and it does not come with dosage instructions. So I had to look them up. Here is what I found ... Each tablet is 23mg soa cat 0-4 lb gets 11.5mg (1/2 tablet)5-11 lb gets 23mg (1 tablet)12+ lb gets 34.5mg (1 1/2 tablets)***DO NOT USE ON KITTENS, A PREGNANT, NURSING, ILL, OR IMMUNE-COMPROMISED CAT!***So make sure to buy the right amount if you have more than one cat. I only gave this product 1 star because I just gave our cats their doses. I will comment on weather or not it worked later on. Hope this helps you out."
5,Very good price for pet medication.,The product arrived two days late but I was not worried about it since it arrived nonetheless. I thought this was a great price for tapeworm treatment. I can go to my local vet and pay 20 dollars for one pill while this pack of three only cost me 12 dollars. It works just like the pills from the vet did. In fact they were the same pill. Very pleased.
4,Works Great!,"My cat got a nasty case of tapeworms, and these tablets cleared it up in one pill! Only gave it four stars instead of five because it doesn't really give you directions about dosage on the package, but I found it elsewhere on the internet. Anyway, this seller was great, got the tabs pretty quick, and they were sooo much cheaper than the same tabs at PetSmart! Definitely recommend!"
5,Works Great,Worked as advertised and with no repeat. The first pill was wasted due to my cat swiping it into the air so wrapped her in a towel and crushed into a small piece of cheese and placed it in her mouth and held her mouth shut and massaged her throat and she swallowed it. No more tapeworms!
4,"Works, well, works fast, but be prepared to fight with your cat","My cat had tapeworms. I gave him these tablets. Now he doesn't. Simple.However, these tablets are absolutely massive. I had to break them in half, have a friend hold the cat while I shoved the tablet in its mouth. Not a fun time.But it's cheap and dependable, so if you don't mind a little fight, go for it."
5,Magic! Use it- avoid the expensive vet!,"I have a very sensitive finicky Persian male cat who all of a sudden got worms in his poo, which of course made him feel under the weather, found this online amazon, ordered it, dissolved half a tab in some water and have to him via water dropper from CVS and walla! No more worms within his next poop!!! It's been a month and no sign of them returning!!! Yay! Plus I have 2 and a half extra for future !"
4,Good Product,noticed my cat had worms. Did some research and found out this was the way to go instead of spending butloads of money at the vet. It does work well.
3,Short and dark,"I'm not that experienced with adventure/puzzle games, but I do know what I like. I like to be able to see. Maybe it's my eyes or the fact that I play games on a laptop, but this game seemed particularly dark to me. I couldn't find several items except by the ""braille"" method.However, it's nice to have the puzzles related to the storyline and not just thrust in front of you because a puzzle seems needed (""I need to use the restroom."" ""I'm sorry, but you'll have to solve this crossword first."").The story seemed a bit short. I confess to using a cheat or two, but I don't think doing that sped up the time that much."
1,A Game?,"I have to agree with my fellow reviewers this game was highly disapointing. The graphics aren't that impressive, the easily motion sick people I suggest that you stay away from this game for when you move the graphics get quite blurry and the movement is quite wreckless.I got extremly board with the game and have yet to finish it (which I don't think I ever will.)This game (if you could call it that) is a waste of money and time. As many others have mentioned this game has little point and no clues as to where to head next."
2,You have got to be kidding me,"I am an adventure gamer. I love this style of game and I have quite a collection. This game is near the BOTTOM of the list.The ""puzzles"" are way too simple, the ""plot"" simply stupid and the ending anticlimactic. I am used to dreamcatcher games being very hit-or-miss, but I never expected this bad. I blew through most of this in half a day. The only reason it took as long as it did is that I had to download a few patches to even run the thing, ..."
2,Disappointed..,"The graphics weren't that great, they tended to blur and go out of focus while you were moving around. I ALSO had to go to their website and download some info so that the game would work right..otherwise I would never have been able to reach the end. It wasn't very challenging, the puzzles were not difficult. You pretty much knew what to do next, and what to pick up from the different scenes. I recommend Myst or Riven if you want a game that will be worth your money."
1,I hate this game,"I hate this game, I couldnt even get out of the first room with cheating with a walkthrough guide. The game was totally boring and wasnt interesting at all. Spend your money on something important."
1,Not Happy,Been to tech support many times to try to load this game. They were of no help to us. Our PC has all the requirements although no success loading. Has anyone else had this problem? Money not well spent.
4,Crystal Clearly Superior,"Pros:1. Beautiful, immersive, atmospheric worlds. Monumental architecture. Eerie music. Breathtaking cut-scenes. Ugly, creepy arch-villain.2. For the most part, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to solve the puzzles.3. Great high-tech tools to use, impressive vehicles to drive and fly, creative use of everyday objects. When you pick items up, they zoom off the screen into your inventory with a whooshing sound. The inventory feature is exceptionally easy to use.Cons:1. Some locations are too dark and murky. I suggest that for the very dark places, you might want to adjust the brightness/contrast on your monitor to make it easier to locate the hidden goodies.2. Some mechanical levers/controls respond correctly only if you move the mouse VERY slowly.3. The game crashed a couple of times, and I never was able to get autoplay to work.Bottom line: A superior, very entertaining adventure marred slightly by minor glitches."
2,Not nearly what I was hoping for,"Because the box showed shots that made it look a lot like Myst or Riven, I thought, ""Hey, this looks cool!"".Unfortunately, I forgot the adage ""Don't judge a book by its cover"".Even though the graphics we quite nice, and the game utilized the 360-degree environment which was pioneered by Presto Studios in ""The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy Of Time"", this game really lacked in a plot and story.Sure, there's puzzles that require a lot of thought. By the time you get to the end, though, your first thought is ""That's IT?!?!!? Boy, that wasn't worth it!"". A very disappointing ending.I played this game on a fairly up-to-date PC, and it never made the computer crash, but I did have to go to Dreamcatcher's website twice to download two programs that are important in the playing. Kinda stupid...as other reviewers noted, they shouldn't have released a game with so many bugs."
1,"A waste of money, a waste of time, a waste of 120mega bites","I'm sorry, I just could not get into this game.I'm not even going to talk about all the bugs in this game, that would take forever and I can only use 1,000 words anyway, so i'll just say this: There's no replay value - sure, you can play through the game once, but what do you do with it after you've beaten it? - and there's nothing to keep you interested in the game if you're stuck on a puzzle. I have to say, I think the only reason dreamcatcher makes games like this is so they can sell strategy guides.Basically, what i'm trying to say here is if you only get the chance to play 10,000 video games in your lifetime, MAKE SURE THE CRYSTAL KEY ISN'T ONE OF THEM!"
2,Unfinished Product?,"I think I'm being generous with the 2 stars I gave this product. This game seems unfinished, as if they ran out of time and just slapped it together. The graphics are okay in some places, not great though, and NOTHING like the pictures on the box. Do not be fooled. In fact, the playing window is quite small, which makes it seem as though you're looking through binoculars - very distracting and annoying. Most of the graphics are very bad. Some of the scenes look like unfocused pictures. The shadows are just black areas with no depth. I don't know what else to say - it's bad. The voice actors add nothing to this game. They aren't really characters, they just appear briefly to provide information. To top it off, there is no ending cinematic. The game just ends with a screen that says, ""Congratulations!"" The puzzles are sometimes entertaining, but that's it."
1,Yuck! Do not waste your money,This game is so full of bugs that it's almost embarrassing. What were the people at Dreamcatcher thinking? Riven and Myst set a very high standard for games. These guys don't even come close. Don't waste your money on this disappointment.
1,very disappointing,"Loved the look, hated the gameplay. I thought the UI was difficult and frustrating. It's too bad because the game seemed so promising."
1,THe Crystal Key,I thought it was going to be like RedJack Revenge ofthe Brethern and Dust etc.. It was difficult to play for example picking objects and going to places. THere was also no interaction with any othert characters in the game . At the end of the game all that the player got was a message that you saved your planet and freeded your people. I was disappointed.
1,Yuck,"Save your money and go get a root canal. I do believe it would be more fun. The only reason I gave it any stars is that you have to, otherwise I think it rates, say, a swift toss in the garbage. I had to turn up the brightness to its maximum setting just to see the lousy graphics. Of course then the colors were all washed out. The puzzels are few and far between. When you do find them, they are extremly easy. When you win, all that pops up is a screen telling you that you won. I kind of like a little more imagination than that, in my games. Also I tend to like games that take a while and tax me. I started this one at about 9am on a Sunday and wrote this when I finished at 2pm. No, I did not just sit there and play either, I managed to clean my apartment also. Like I said at the begining, save your money or buy a different game!!!"
1,Crash City,"Despite reconfiguring my computer more times than I can count I could never get this game to play for more than a minute without crashing and giving my entire PC some sort of seizure. Contact with Dreamcatcher elicited a polite but never-ending stream of things that must be wrong, settings that had to be changed, shutting down EVERY running program (including Intellimouse). Good GOD, Why would you put out a game that requires a user to COMPLETELY RESET their computer just to be able to play it! Yes, it's cheap--but that doesn't mean you should buy it. Twenty bucks for a game that doesn't work is still twenty bucks gone. Capsule Review: Beware!"
3,"Good beginning, [bad] ending","I actually really liked this game -- or most of it. The scenery was beautifully rendered and the locations were interesting. The story line was not really very compelling, however. It was more of a reason to put you in the game in the first place than a driving factor, but that didn't bother me too much. I also liked the puzzles, many of which involved lateral thinking and looking around the environments for hidden clues.However. There were an awful lot of bugs in this game and it crashed frequently. And it seemed that just when things were starting to get interesting, it was over. The ending was abrupt and dissatisfying.If you're jonesing for an adventure game, go ahead and play it because there are many enjoyable moments. But you might want to borrow a friend's copy rather than buy it."
2,A Big Letdown,"I bought this game because I had finished Myst and Riven and was hungry for a new adventure game. I spotted this while browsing in the store and thought it looked similar to MYST/RIVEN and would keep me occupied until the Miller brothers came up with more Myst sequels. That will be the last time I ever buy a game without checking online reviews of the game. While the graphics and puzzles are pretty good, I found the plot and characters two-dimensional. I also had a technical problem with one of the puzzles and had to download a patch that solved it for me. Gee, how fun it that? Dreamcatcher should've known better than to release a game with so many bugs in it."
2,does indeed fall short,"Crystal key has terrific graphics, yes. The storyline has a promising beginning. There are occasional snippets of good music. However, the game is horribly slow on my computer. It often took 30 seconds or more to move to the next scene, which made it cumbersome to use. The storyline falls apart after the opening and, while you go about seeking things and solving puzzles and such, the storyline virtually disappears. The creators have created a nice universe, but leave you with no information about it. The ending, as well, is horribly anticlimatic. You finish the game wondering what happened and why."
1,Confusing and Boring,Story and puzzels seemed illogical. Many pictures were very dark. Many items were hidden in very difficult to find places (far bottom of a screen and too hard to find). Had to jump from one world to another with little rhyme or reason. I did not enjoy this at all.
2,"Too short, too easy, no great thrill&#65533;","I experienced no technical problems, (though I'm running 896 megs of RAM, less RAM may mean more glitches and freezes), however this game is so simplistic, it's not worth the time.As a RPG fanatic, I have to say the main character had no development or real background, no choices other than to select where to go and how to solve puzzles. There is no interaction with other characters and, other than the graphics, I can't think of much that redeems this game.Save your money or spend it on something else."
3,You get what you pay for...,"Granted, the pictures and graphics are good, but the storyline could have been a lot richer - I felt like I was missing out on a large part of the story - the puzzles were good 9 there was a real-world logic about them, but DO NOT expect an exciting ending...considering how cheap it was, I'm not surprised."
4,Crystal Key,"Pretty good game. I would probably even play it again. I do usually cheat by getting walkthroughs for any pc games I play, but even with the walkthroughs, it still had some tough, challenging spots."
1,That crackling noise is your money burning,"This is dragon lady's daughter now excuse me, I am going to breath fire.Long story short, if you are intellegent, have a head on your shoulders, are not a martyr,enjoy a good computer game, and are not on heavy medication, DON'T BUY THIS FRIGGN' GAME!!!!!!!!!!! You spend an untold amount of time banging your head on the key board and yelling profanitys at the computer as you play this pile of filth. The gliches are constantly annoying, half the time the screen is too dark, the story line is so uncomplicated a preschooler would blush, and to actually get anywere through this quagmire you have to go online and get the cheats (speaking of which, the cheats I found online were obviously written by the company, because I wouldn't have been half as darn freaking cheery if I had written them.) Bottom line, whoever you are where ever you are love yourself dont buy this thing. (I refuse to call it a proper game)"
3,Not Dreamcatcher's best outing,The Crystal Key is probably best for players that don't have much experience with these types of interactive games. The puzzles are not too difficult for the most part and it does get boring rather quickly. Each section of the game is too limited as to how far you can explore an area. The scenery is not as lush and interesting as some games and the musical scoring could have been much better. I played this after playing Myst III which had more interesting graphics and characters to interact with. This was a gift so if I had payed for it myself it would have been a bigger disappointment.
4,The Crystal Key! (well Done),"I really liked the game. The puzzles are hard, but thats the reason why we buy the games. To let are minds work! But the game Puzzles might be to hard on some people, so i think you should give out HINTS or maybe some cheats for people not to get frustrated, and maybe they'll buy more of your games."
1,Not worth the time and the money,"Pass on this one. Game is buggy and conflicts with Quick Time. No help from the DreamCatcher web site and you can forget customer support. Even when the game does run, it's not very interesting and some of the places are so dark, you won't even see the puzzles. The company has a well-deserved reputation for shallow, half-baked games. Spend your money elsewhere. There are far better games on the market. Gets one star because system does not allow none."
1,Boring!,"The Crystal Key was over before it began! Not only were there few actual puzzles to solve, but they were boring puzzles at that. With no character interaction besides a Martian that you have to hide from, this game proved to be the biggest waste of my money."
1,Profound waste of money.,"All right, so it's going to be a while before we find something equal to Myst and Riven. I can accept that. In fact, I was expecting that. However, even without those two comparisons, The Crystal Key falls flat. The graphics, while beautiful, are confusing and overdone. It seems like if they spend countless hours designing these environments, you should have more freedom to explore them. No such luck. If it's nonessential you can't go anywhere near it, and if it's essential, it's too dark to see even with my monitor's brightness turned all the way up. The puzzles have a faint logic to them, sure, but it's convoluted logic at best. I had to resort to a walkthrough site at the beginning of the second world, and for almost every puzzle after that. The recorded messages make sense only in the context of someone there to tell you what's going on. All in all, it's either too set up or not set up enough, and not worth playing even at the low price."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this when I was in my ""Adventure"" mode. Several other games earned my dollar, such as Lightbringer, Gabriel Knight 3, Kings Quest 8, etc. This one, however, was not really with the $19.95 I spent.The visuals are beautiful. The gameplay is too linear however. You have to ""do this"" before you can ""do that."" There is no way to accomplish your goals in multiple ways. Whereas this concept was astonishing 3 years ago, it no longer appeals to the gamer.Another gripe: WAY TOO SHORT. If Al Gore had played and beaten this game, he would have demanded a recount and a re-recount. (LOL...oh, the political humor!)Buy this game only if you truly are a fan of mindless puzzles and rail gameplay. If you want a little more freedom in a game with a little more depth, story, character development and replay value, look elsewhere."
1,Waste of good money,"The graphics were mediocre, the storyline quite lame, and the clues very frustrating. Could not advance without a game book, but am not willing to spend more money on this game."
1,I want my money back!!!,"We were excited to find a game like Myst and Riven. Boy did we have a rude awakening. The movement was good as you went through the game, but you couldn't go anywhere you didn't have to go. There was no investigating. The game was almost impossible to go through with out some hints. The green screens about drove us nuts and the graphics were substandard.If you liked Myst and Riven, chances are you won't like this."
1,Don't buy this game. Just play Myst again. . .,"First of all, shame on Dreamcatcher for putting out a game withmajor bugs ... . Secondly, the plot is dull and too predictable. The only good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are nice; but even that was just an annoying reminder of what a great game this could have been. The authors shouldn't have bragged that this game was five years in the making. That just made it all the more disappointing. Crystal Key is not worth the money, time or frustration. It's items like this that makes me wish Amazon had a rating level of ""no stars""."
2,Disappointing,"As an avid adventure gamer, I found the plot to be less than intriguing and the puzzles to be simplistic and random. Graphics were way too dark, and having to go back to different worlds to pick up items frustrating. I give it a BIG YAWN!"
2,They tried,I was so disappointed in this game. It really had very little story line and the graphics were poorly done as well as the puzzles. I may have spent 3 hours on this game from start to finish and continued to be disappointed with the ending of the game. About all I can say about this game is that they tried...
1,a bit disapointing,"On the bright side this game had some nice graphics, but I could not get through it without the walk through. After I got the walk through, it still did'nt hold my attention. I put the game away and hav'nt picked it up since."
1,What the heck is this game about?,"I've had this game for months but due to lack of time I just got around to playing it yesterday. This is one of the most boring and annoying games I've ever played. I won't go into the grainy images, the dark screens, etc., as the previous 41 reviewers have said it all! While I did not experience any crashes or bugs (as I have with many other games by Dreamcatcher Interactive) I found no rhyme or reason to this game. Other than the fact that the Arkonian world has been devastated and Ozgar must be destroyed, there's no real plot or even one character that one can relate to. I've made a vow never to buy another Dreamcathcer game - ever!"
1,Don't Support Drug Addicts,"Unfortunately, all album sales and downloads are used to support a less than talented musician's self-admitted problem with prescription drugs. Making matters worse, Jackson ""Sneedles"" Sneed, was recently convicted of forgery after being caught manipulating and selling fake tickets to many concert goers. This is not the type of musician that Amazon or anyone, for that matter, should support in any way. Jackson needs to face the wrath of his mistakes. Hopefully, this will occur in the very near future."
1,"Worst album ever??,",This guys music makes WSP seem like the best band EVER!!!If you like an artist PISSING IN YOUR EAR then this album is for you!!!
5,excellent,The Food here is fast and taste incredible. I am new to raw foods and this book has many recipes my children will EAT!!!Thank you!
4,Not Bad,Title is catchy and I appreciate anyone trying to make it delicious and quick for raw foodists. Tried one of the recipes and it was good.
5,Just plain ymmy!,"The shipping was really fast, made it here before any of my other books ordered at the same time. The first recipe I tried everyone loved. I can't wait to continue on my quest for good health this year."
4,Raw in Ten Minutes,"I like this book alot. The layout could use some work and some cross-referencing of other recipes would be nice to have page numbers that match the recipe, but the food is really tasty by and large."
1,Garbage,"I was very excited when I found this book because so many of the raw food recipes are very time consuming. I bought this book at a book store, not on amazon, and I returned it the next day. This recipe book is more than disappointing. As others have mentioned a lot of the recipes take longer than ten minutes and taste awful. I have many other raw food recipe books and in comparison this one is complete garbage. Don't waste your money."
1,The worst cookbook you can buy.,"I was very disappointed. Most recipes took more than 10 minutes and tasted horrible. I have other raw books that the recipes really do take 10 minutes or less and taste really good. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, not even to make dog food."
3,Dissapointed,"I bought this book based on the reviews. We are very new to raw food and thought this would be a good one. I have tried a few of the recipes but don't find them to be very detailed. The Baklava is good but basically it says to cut the apples in four pieces and put the filling in. Do I peel them? What about the seeds? How do I get them out? I guess I am not much of a cook (or non-cook) so I need a bit more guidance than this book gives. I also agree that the recipes call for ingredients that I would usually not have, but then this could be because we are so new at it."
2,Raw in Ten Minutes is very disappointing,"The author states he is involved in many different endeavors. Raw in Ten Minutes seemed to be one of those endeavors that did not have complete dedication. Like other reviewers, I too agree there is too much fat from nuts. You can call nuts good fat, but fat is fat and it can build up in your arteries. As an example, one of the author's recipes calls for two cups of Brazil nuts. Using www.nutritionfacts.com, one cup of Brazil nuts contains approximately 88.4 grams of total fat and 20.1 grams of saturated fat. Two cups would equal 176.8 grams of total fat and 40.2 grams of saturated fat. Yikes! If the recipe was for two to three servings.....well, you decide if it is too much fat for you. I recommend that anyone transitioning to raw analyze your recipes for nutrition content. Also, read ""The China Study"" and ""Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease"".I gave this book two stars just for the author's enthusiasm for life."
2,Better Raw Books Out There,"2 stars for having a few decent recipes. Of all the raw 'un-cook-books' I own, this is only one that I've been disappointed in.Many of Au's recipes are very unbalanced, as if some of the ingredients amounts are incorrect - extensive changes improved them, but if the changes are extensive, I feel like it's not really his recipe I'm using anymore. Other recipes were fairly tasteless & disappointing. I couldn't get a few recipes to 'work' (gel together, or mix as claimed), no matter what combination I tried.The raw books by Alyssa Cohen, Juliano, & Sarma Melngailis are much more worthwhile."
2,Not the best,"I am a certified raw food chef but making fancy food can be a pain and pretty time consuming. I thought this book would be an easy help. I was really disappointed with the quality of the recipes, quick yes, tasty, not by any means. However, there are a few good ones on here but I think you would be better off getting a real raw food cookbook."
2,Sudden endings sour sweet sounds,"Charles Brown sounds fine, and the tunes are choice. But jerky editing creates abrupt endings that destroy the mood. After being jarred too many times, I gave up on this disc. Brown deserves better than this, and so do listeners. Find a more deftly handled collection. Even at the bargain price, this one is a bad buy."
5,dessert for the ears,"I heard this CD playing while walking the streets of Edinburgh and fell in love with it. Something for everyone. Traditonal, yet a few tunes rock. The sound captures the soul and spirit of Scotland for me, to listen to it now takes me back to the smell of hot coffee on Princes street. You can hear the cool gray skies as well as the warm hearts."
2,Small mini pendant,"We attempted to install these over our bar in the kitchen. These mini pendants truly are just that. We found them much smaller than we anticipated. Perhaps, we should have paid more attention to the product description. The glass color is beautiful. It should be noted that the glass pattern does have red as shown, but other colors (blue) were in pattrn as well."
4,Bluesy and Soulful,"This CD presents a live set by pianist Harris and his quartet (Frank Potenza, guitar; Luther Hughes, bass; Paul Kreibich, drums) augmented on some cuts by Red Holloway, tenor sax; Ernie Watts, alto sax; Brother Jack McDuff, organ; and Niki Harris (Gene's daughter), vocals. The music is soulful, funky at times, and always energetic. Harris is really solid on the piano, playing with both hands and really digging into the keyboard, and the rest of the group gets into the spirit of things, with only the drumming seeming sometimes rather routine. The highlight of the set is the Eddie Harris tune, ""Listen Here,"" which the band has fun with for more than 11 minutes. This may not be a CD that you will want to play over and over, but if you like your jazz on the bluesy, soulful, tuneful side, you may enjoy this set as much as the audience in Seattle seemed to have enjoyed it when it was originally laid down. The recording is good for a live set."
5,Nice for the price!,"I love this compass. I read a review about how the mirror was not clear. Too bad the guy didn't take off the plastic covering the mirror. It has a thin see through plastic for protection that makes the compass look hazy. But as I looked closer I seen the corner of it lifted up and was very happy to have a very clear mirror. Very good for the price! Don't need those extra things just add and subtract declination yourself. I need glasses to read from up close but can usually read normal size letters and numbers. I found that the declination numbers were too small for me and thought it was easier to just add and subtract declination by myself. Remember, declination east compass least. Declination west compass best. least you subtract and best you add. Have fun using your Suunto MCA-D Compass!"
4,"Nice item, a bit big",This is a nice-quality compass! I expected it to be a bit smaller but that's OK. Works fine :-)
1,Crap,I have been waiting almost a month for this and i have already been charged. The company just keeps giving me the run around. unless it washes dishes when it gets here it was not worth the wait.
5,Wonderful group,Sons of the Desert are the best group around. There songs bring out feelings from the heart. Even though they were dumped by there former record company they are going strong again with MCA. They are a great live performance to see as well. And very nice to talk to.(I have there Autographs)
3,A good primer on French culture.,"Edith Wharton was a very observant writer and a great novelist. Her observations on the French in most cases are right on target. However, people traveling to France for work or pleasure need to understand that she is writing about a France in the early part of the 20th centur before and during World War I. When a person writes about a culture there observations only pertain to that particular time and that particular place. Another, thing to rember she is also writes about upper-class french life, which is a problem I find with almost all books on the French. Other then those two critices this is a very entertaining and insightful book on the French.On parting coment, remeber that when someone writes about a diffrent culture they are using generalizations that may be true of the culture but not everyone in it."
4,smooth & nice soul,"Very good voices, nice and smooth tracks, a fine production. This really is a good soul-album :)"
1,Bored Stiff!,"Boring,unimaginative,predictable tales written by Snooze and Snore.A definite cure for insomnia.Stick to the ""Hot Blood ""Series for real sex and terror tales with real thrills and Chills.Worst collection of Garbage I've ever been punished by."
2,All the small things,"Blink 182 is a great band! In my opinion the best. All the small things is a great song i loved it from day one when the cd first came out! Emema of the state is an OK cd i guess. blink's old stuff is way better so if your an older blink fan like myself you may not enjoy this cd as much as you liked cheshire cat, buddah, and dude ranch."
4,good but not great,"i liked blink 182 since dude ranch came out,and i think there the best , but this song is dumb compared to their other songs.if you want expert advice listen to me. 1 dude ranch..........2 cheshire cat....................3 buddha.........4 in line 5.............enama of the state"
2,Disappointing,"The drive for Bible-based Christian unity motivated me to purchase this book. After reading it I was convinced that there was hope for some level of ""unity"" between the Church of God (Anderson, IN) and the independent Christian Churches/Churches of Christ. Thus I attended the Church of God's annual ""Camp Meeting"" in Anderson in 2000. What I found was a group transitioning into a more formal denominational structure, something that would be a direct block to unity with independent Christian Churches. The book was a great read, but now I know it belongs to the genre of ""Religious Fiction."""
3,"For the groove and Terry's voice , not the 'songs'","I was lucky to pick this up cheap - I say that because I already had Terry's LP called SEED OF MEMORY , which has a lot more form to it and which I had enjoyed .RIVER sounded formless and very much like it was being made up on the spot . I couldn't really make out what the lyrics were , which is important for me .I suppose some rock music made in LA in the 70's was the product of over indulgence - in a number of different things .I would recommend buying SEED OF MEMORY instead of this album as it is ( or seems to me ) more structured .Listen to it first , as your tastes may be different .I will be trading my copy of RIVER ."
3,River flows again in U.S.,"This is the album the great singer/songwriter Terry Reid made after he moved from Britain to California. The jet lag shows. This is one of his weakest records, yet most Reid fans will find it oddly satisfying. This rerelease is the same mix as the Japanese import of a few years back, but the packaging and liner notes are improved. The record starts out promisingly enough, with ""Dean,"" but then descends into what appears to be a series of demos. The final three tracks arrive just in time to redeem the effort. Four solid Terry Reid tracks make this disc worth my money, but others should be aware. Check out the wonderful records ""Terry Reid,"" ""Seed of Memory"" and (if you can find it) ""The Driver."""
1,Bad Bracket - Not for Honda CR-V,"This bracket does not fit a 2000 Honda CR-V as it is advertised....Do not buy it, I don't know what it fits but its not as advertised"
1,Fiskars has gone Chinese: Badly!,"Three years ago, I purchased a Stihl pruning saw that had a blade manufactured by Fiskars: this was the finest hand saw that I have ever owned. I just purchased two of the Fiskars 7"" saws from Amazon, mistakenly thinking that they would be of the same blade quality. I was wrong. The Fiskars saw will not cut with anything like the authority or ease of the Stihl (it cuts at half the speed and with three times the effort), and is likely to be of use only as a paperweight. This ""new"" Chinese-manufactured Fiskars product, in my opinion, will do a lot to ruin Fiskars otherwise good reputation. Amazon, would you like these saws back?"
5,Much better than expected,"For the price... this folding saw is much better than I expected. I expected to receive a 'better-than-nothing' folding saw to carry in my backpack and use when camping. It is sufficiently light weight for carrying in my backpack and much higher quality than I thought it would be. The handle is comfortable - even for my small hand. The saw has a hole in the handle which serves for hanging or attaching if desired. The blade is described as ""razor sharp"" and it comes out of the packaging dangerously sharp indeed. I also appreciate the fact that when I fold it up, the razor sharp blade is automatically locked into place and can only be opened by releasing the push button lock. This is a safety feature which I value. I am satisfied that this was a good investment of a very small amount of money. Free shipping was an added bonus."
1,compact saw?,Does not cut well. Blade clogs and requiresa lot of effort even though it is comfortable in your hand.Not the old Fiskars quality blade!
2,Not Impressed,"I was disappointed in the quality of this saw. The blade would barely cut. The teeth had been spread too far apart so I pushed them closer together with pliers to create a thinner kurf. This helped some but was still slow. I was surprised with Fiskars, usually top quality tools. They should stay away from selling low quality items even if the price is cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Gets the job Done,"I love this tool, if you are looking to cut small branches this is the right tool for simple gardening. If you need something more powerful this isnt the item. What do you expect for 10 bucks."
4,An honest account of Kathy's teen years,"Being 19, I could see my younger self in a lot of Kathy Dobie's actions, thoughts, and feelings. She was extremely honest about everything, including the gang-rape that she was forced into. This book is a good example of how mean kids can really be to each other, showing how they isolate a single person to make themselves feel higher & mightier. I really enjoyed this read, though I did think some parts were slower than others which is why I gave it 4/5 stars. I'd reccomend this to anyone."
1,BOOOORING!!!!!!!!!!!!,ALL I CAN SAY IS ITS NOT AN EASY BOOK TO READ BECAUSE I KEEP FALLING ASLEEP ON THE BOOK...IT WAS HORRIBLY WRITTEN...I DID NOT WANT TO GET TO THE NEXT CHAPTER AT ALL I JUST WANTED TO SEND IT BACK...
3,A happy family,"I can't quite figure out what happened to Kathy. Her family seemed to really care about her. No absentee father, abusive mother...so why the rush to become sexual at such an early age. What was missing? As a grown woman who also overcame the stigma of being labeled slut and all the other terribly hurtful words teenaged boys and girls sling I can look back and see how I was craving love and companionship. Kath....what motivated you to try to grow up so fast? An answer would be great...anyone?"
2,Disappointing,"When I first saw this book I thought it sounded very interesting, but then I was proved wrong. The book didn't have much to do with the title itself. The first half was describing every aspect of her home, friends hair color, etc. I found it boring. The middle got slightly more interesting. Then it was like she wrapped the entire book up in the last chapter. She went from child throughout the book to BOOM the rest of her life history in the last chapter. I also felt that she didn't explain very well what she learned through the experience. The book was jerky reading and as other readers said what was the real reason she was like this? She would one minute say what a happy family she had and then say how she hated them. Just made no sense to me. I have read alot better memoirs out there."
1,poor service,The watch arrived broken. I contacted the seller and there was no concrete response. Do not buy this seller
4,nice story,"the first story has to do with the planet of trill. there are riots among the people who are not joined with simbionts. they want equal standing and the truth of the history of the past that has been so well hidden. when the rioting is at it's worse, ezra embarks on a dangerous journey to find the truth. what she finds out could either help or destroy trill.i thought that this story was well thought out and a real pleasure to read.the second story is about bajor. according to the back of the book, captain kira would play a big role in the story. she was thrown in almost as an afterthought. the story spent too much time jumping to too many unknown people to be really interesting, and they spent too much time on sisko and his everyday life. there is a nice piece on jake though. any kira fans will be sadly disappointed. the small part she has was so predictable they might as well have left it out."
4,astropolitics and intrigue,"The first part of this volume on Trill was average overall but had it's moments where I thought some starting revelation would reveal itself or some amazing discovery would be made. There has been so much written about the ""secrets"" of the Trills, but the apparent ""secret"" isn't all that extrodinary. The revelation which was made doesn't do much to change the direction of the series but we do learn a little more about the origin of the parasites.I liked the second part (Bajor) much better because we learn what's going on with Sisco and his family and get back into the politics of Bajor which has always been interesting. There are two things which happen in this part which sort of changes the direction of the series. Something happens with Jake and a startling discovery is made. The startling discovery has to do with a destroyed village on Bajor and an Orb. Certain facts have led to the conclusion that there is a mole on board Deep Space Nine."
1,blackmore infomercial,"Ten minutes into this DVD I stopped being a Blackmore fan. This is nothing but a bunch of people I've never heard of, going on and on about how great and underrated Blackmore is.How about showing us, and let us decide for ourselves.In fairness, I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole, thing, so there may be something worth seeing on here, but, from what I saw, only the most hardcore fans will enjoy this."
1,unknown singer tries to cash in on band's past glory,"The description I read for this stated that Joe Lynn Turner and Graham Bonet were interviewed during this documentary. False. What you'll get is a 59 minute poorly made video of mostly unknown people who had nothing to do with the band, sharing opinions on who they think was Rainbow's best singer etc... It reminded me of the kind of talk I'd share with friends in high school except our conversation was more interesting and articulate then the people interviewed in this video. You'll see short snipets of the band, repeated, and opinions shared, and repeated, but the only band member actually on the video is a johnny come lately guy who made a rainbow album that most people never knew was even made when Blackmore threw together a band on a whim. Ever hear of ' Stranger in us all' ? Me neither. When the disc was over I wanted these 59 minutes of my life back!"
5,Great guide to Joe's,My husband and I enjoyed this guide and found it very useful for our collection. Great pictures with accessories. Just seemed very complete for the collector. Well done in my opinion and would recommend.
4,Great job overall,"I will start by saying I think this is just about the best book of its kind on the market. Lots of great pictures and item details. I wish book space hadn't been given for a price guide however because price guides in books are only a snapshot in time and 1-2 years from now may be worthless, but the toy history will last forever. Then only real price guide in my opinion is eBay and I wish people would stop putting price guides in publication. I also agree with a prior comment that most vehicle pictures were just top down shots and I think isometric shots of all vehicles would have been more valuable. Also a picture of the carded figures/boxed vehicles would have added nicely. Gripes out of the way, I do think that the amount of information and the order presented worked very effectively and I have not found another publication that comes close."
4,Better pictures would be great,"The book is great. Very complete, good text and interesting information. The action figures' pictures are also perfect. But ... the vehicles' pictures disappointed me a lot. Most of the pictures are top views, which I believe do not give a good understanding of the shape and appearance of the vehicles. Isometric or perspective views would be more representative. Last, many of the pictures presented in the book are OUT OF FOCUS! This is bad."
5,"Excellent reference guide for 1982-94 3/4"" G.I. Joes & Assessories!","Excellent reference guide for 1982-94 3/4"" G.I. Joes & Accessories! With a forward and additional notes from Larry Hama, and countless pictures of all of the first generation of 3/4"" G.I. Joes, vehicles, play-sets, and accessories, Mark Bellomo does a great job in covering everything with pictures and descriptions. If anything, we could have been treated to a few more pictures: notably better angles of some of the vehicles & play-sets and close-ups of the rarer items and/or more shots of the packaging. Perhaps the newer edition has these, but I got this one for the great price in comparison to the revised edition. Makes a great book end for Bellomo's Transformers guide of the same era, which is also very good. Highly recommended books, both!"
1,research more,"Two issues with these visors. First they arrived cracked. The external packaging was good, so wonder if they were shipped out already cracked.Second, the way these would install is directly onto the paint of the vehicle. Most visors go into the window well, which is what I was expecting. I wouldn't want to take the chance they would catch in a car wash and pry off the paint.I will continue to research better alternatives. These were the least expensive and the price comparable to my other vehicle visors, but do not install the same."
3,Not enough ground clearance on plowed soil,I had to return it because it was too close to the ground for seeding barley cover crop between grapevine rows. It would probably be great for lawn seed or fertilizer
5,A fun game for adults,"An interesting strategy game-- we've played with as few as 2 players, and as many as 5, and although play is a little slow, it's fun! If you're looking for an alternative to Monopoly, this game's for you!"
2,not very helpful,"This book has some interesting articles, however it does not tell one how to realize the goals of the title."
3,Time Hasn't Gone By...,"These songs are just as they were in the 1930's. I'm with Brett. I expected another forray into the ""Taxi"" cover style rock world. But...."
2,Let bygones be bygones Bryan,"I was truely disapointed with your music this evening. You are an intelligent man, but I am afraid your performance this evening at the Beacon Theater was a flop. Your voice was hidden behind the sound of your bands instruments. I expected a lot more ravery from you Bryan."
1,Who's singing?,"I was very disappointed in this CD - I didn't hear the distinctive Bryan Ferry voice I love. I played it once, not even to the end & haven't played it since."
3,Oh so close but ........,"Well I love Bryan but this album is just a bit flat for me. His vocal tracks over power the music, in volume not in tlalent (Sorry Bryan). I think if you are going to cover these songs they should be true to the original sound or go all the way and make them yours like Nina Simone does, she can create a whole new feel to a classic song without you wanting to here the original. Just a thought. Maybe some ""noise"" like on an old 78RPM would help these out and make them more ""real"". Who knows, but I still love the old Bry for trying. I know he can do it, we all love ""These foolish things"". Maybe next time?!?!"
4,As Time Goes By,"As Time Goes By being a cover album Ferry that covers classics such as ""As Times Goes By"", ""The Way You Look Tonight"" and ""Easy Living"" to mention a few. Compared to Ferry's These Foolish Things the covers are not quite as strong. Even so Ferry is an accomplish crooner and his vocals are impeccable. All the lyrics are included which is quite unusual. For each track we also get a list of whom plays what. The drawings are amazing and fit the songs very well. 4/5."
1,tired and superfluous,"Ferry used to put his heart into covers of old songs. His cover of ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" had an energy and excitement to it. On this CD, however, he sings everything in the same dreary, breathy croon, as if he wants this to be background music. You keep wanting him to clear his throat and sing. Even the selection of songs is uninspired; no one needs yet another version of As Time Goes By, when there are so many old songs that are unjustly forgotten. Much better stuff in this vein is Vic Godard's Songs For Sale, and Bjork's Glim-glo."
2,A surprisingly weak album from a great vocalist,"Make no mistake; I love Bryan Ferry. I got this album after hearing ""Falling in Love Again"" (which granted is one of the rare winners on this crooner's CD) at a restaurant. The rest of the CD is so-so, and Ferry's voice wavers surprisingly over some of the note arrangements. Instead of the robust voice that melts thorugh songs like ""Limbo"" and ""More than This,"" his performance is oddly tinny. Stick to his Roxy Music catalog."
2,Is this supposed to be some kind of joke?!!!!,"After 5 years of waiting after Mamouna this was all that Bryan Could come up with? Don't get me wrong Bryan Ferry is a great singer with a lot of talent but unfortunately this album doesn't show much of it. What we get here is something that reminds me of leftover musical table scraps. Bryan's voice sounds terrible and the music itself is boring, dry and devoid of any life. It seems like no effort put at all into the songs and the result was not very good. I,m sure that some fans may criticize my review but I stand my case. This is like the equivelent of eating paper when listening to this. I became a big fan of him especially after first hearing Bete Noire but I am sorely dissapoited with this one. On the positive side the CD itself is pretty well colored and makes a good coaster. It's also good to listen to while reading. It's not a total loss."
1,As talent goes by,"Yikes, this is one of the WORST albums I've ever heard of the standards. Bryan Ferry has recorded some of the most beautiful songs of our time, but he hasn't the voice, interpretive skills or finesse to do them justice. His instrument is shot; that's not singing, that's croaking, that's rasping. What a waste of vintage arrangements when you've got no tonal beauty for this material. That's a shame because these tunes are timeless. You don't have to be Tony Bennett or Frank Sinatra to sing them; I can think of glorious-sounding young pop voices like Tom Andersen, Jack Donahue or Brian Lane Green who can perform the classic songs with such feeling and fun. Believe or not, I've actually enjoyed some Roxy Music in the past, but I'm sorry: Ferry doesn't meet the high standards he's set forth."
2,dissapointing,"Bryan was best when For Your Pleasure was new. Now he sounds so very tired. If you like remakes of the music from the 30's and 40's (which I do), there are many superior efforts available."
2,he just doesn't have the voice for it,"the opening track is splendid, but don't be taken in - listen to a few more before you buy. the problem with this collection of covers from the 30s and 40s is that ferry just can't live up to the great singing legends who did them first time around. bryan ferry has always been seen as a bit of a crooner, but that's because he looks the part, and all of his songs were carefully crafted (or in the case of earlier cover albums completely reworked) to accommodate his rather strange and limited vocal range."
1,Jarring,"Some renditions are pleasant, but some are just irritating. In particular, ""The Way You Look Tonight"" sounds like a march for tin soldiers. Although nothing can compare with Ferry's ""Slave to Love,"" lovers of standards might be disappointed with this album."
5,Outstanding jersey,"My son was having trouble finding a throwback jersey for less than $100. He figured this would be just okay, but it was well under the $100 price point. He was very pleasantly surprised. The shirt came very quickly and is well-made and heavy weight material not a cheap knockoff. This is very well worth the money and the shipping is outstanding. I have nothing bad to say."
1,not charging,I purchase this product twice and each time the Shaver did not hold a charge. Got refund. Shame on Remington for giving this product to a third party knowing that the shaver's will not hold a charge because the batteries inside are too old. tsk tsk..........
2,Remington R9190,"Although the design and features of this razor are nice, the shave is lacking. After using this unit I still feel and look like I need a shave. The Remington foils do a much better job."
1,This one drew blood,"I do not understand how a company could engineer such a device that would actually shave the skin from your neck, but they have. I got this as an early Christmas present and tried it this evening. It literally ate me up. I've been using the same Braun shaver for many years and decided I would ask for a new shaver. My wife feels very guilty now."
1,Bugs.,"Bugs, Bugs, and more Bugs. After downloading the 2 ineffective patches (Cydonia, its former name, and Lightbringer patches), the Game is completely frozen. The Publisher, DreamCatcher Interactive, has Technical Support that will not answer its E-Mail. Must be tough getting 10,000 E-Mail's all with the same questions. Until DreamCatcher gets on the Stick, don't waste your money on a game that won't work."
3,Searching for Mother,"The search for the mother leads one cat out into the world. The little cat awakes to find it is home alone. It quickly takes action to fine its elusive mother. No one seems to see her, but she is always just slightly visible to the reader. There of course is the devastating moment when the kitten believes its mother is gone for ever, but of course it is a happy reunion in the end. It is a children's book after all. The book is simplistically written, but it has a lot of charm. All of us can relate to searching for something meaningful, and what is more meaningful to a small kitten then its mother."
3,Punk / Ska,"I bought a lot (as in random assortment) of punk CD's and this was one of the CD's included. I say this only because I doubt anyone will find this CD intentionally, much less read this review. Hence I will make it quick and straight forward...As it has been insinuated, this is a ska band who released their CD in the late 1990's. Theres two or three prettty good songs but the rest are fairly mediocre. Also the recordings pretty poor, it may take some time to adjust.Worth a purchase? Probably only for those really into the genre."
4,"pleasant, interesting, readable, enjoyable","This is a lot better than many mysteries I've read recently. The main character is interesting, pleasant, and believable. I do wonder, sometimes, about the police in mystery novels, so ready to let a relative or friend in on the police work, even before following police procedures. It would be nice if the police in these mysteries were also believable."
4,Lovely Plumage!,"This Norwegian Blue Parrot is a beautiful and graceful animal! Unfortunately, mine arrived in a deceased state. When I called to complain, the attendant just said it wasn't dead, it was pinin for the fjords! That lying pikey..."
1,Seven inch Blue Parrot,"This isn't a Monty Python parrot. It isn't officially sanctioned by the Python gang or the BBC.What you have here is a 7 inch blue parrot turned upside down in a photo.It's a parrot parody. The glowing reviews are, of course, written by Amazon third party salespeople...what a joke. Yeah, that's the REAL joke here. That, and the idea that they want you to pay about five times what this little stuffed animal is worth. I got one at a discount store for a fraction of the cost, laid it on its back and placed it on the coffee table. What a hoot, I thought to myself. Friends came to visit. Nobody asked what a dead parrot was doing on my table. Most ignored the poor chap. One friend actually started to play with him and squeeze the stuffing out of him. Not a bit of fun in my line of thinking.Nope, you can do better than this, folks. And, I'm sorry, no kids have an inkling of an idea of what Monty Python is, nor do they give a poot."
5,Joe Augustine___ what a talent,I have several albums by Joe Augustine. I love every one of them. I really can't decide which one I love the most. His music is so relaxing and enjoyable. I would recommend this album to anyone.
2,No illustrations,"Like many Oz-series books offered for Kindle, the illustrations are absent except for the cover image. The entire 'Baum' series seems to be available with most or all illustrations, but not many of the subsequent books by Ruth Plumly Thompson and John R. Neill. I returned this book, along with several other Oz books, once I realized that the illustrations were missing. I have high hopes for the future though, and do not mind paying a reasonable price for having the entire book available on Kindle Fire."
5,"I'M SO HAPPY, I'M CRYING","This is one of the best albums ever, great artwork also from a great band, which words cannot describe, if this was any better it would be bishop montgomery football"
3,Hit and miss,"What we have here is an interesting album by a very capable band. It starts strong with two very rocking emo-punk songs, somewhat reminiscent of Jawbreaker. Then, the album hits a big four song lull in the middle, drowning in emo cliches and boring music. Then, it picks back up with ""You Made A Way For Moses"", and amazing heartfelt acoustic song, and closes with a more upbeat rock song. There are some awesome tunes here, and each track has something to like, but musically some more thought could have been put into this. Also, the vocals and production are somewhat unpolished. Lyrically, this album is one of my favorites, but I wouldn't recommend to someone that is just getting into indie rock."
4,Good reference for beginner and beyond,"I'm an NT administrator, new to the world of Unix, and definately find this book informative. ""Mastering Unix"" is well written, not only as a reference for the experienced, but for those who are new to Unix as well."
4,you can't go back for love,"Love is good,but business is better,you can't go back for love.People move on and change"
3,I didnt think it was that bad,"The movie has beautiful people, styling, and scenery. OK acting, a very unrealistic story line, and the over all movie definitely could have been better. I'm not to familiar with the Great Gatsby so that may be why I just didn't get the movie... however it was captivating and kept my attention."
5,off the Geezy.,I have to say that I just love Richard T. Jones so I may be judging it on him. But I do like this movie a lot and could watch it everyday. I have bought it like 3 times already. Can't loan this one out cuz it's costing me to replace it.
3,Entertaining and pleasing to the eye.,Richard T. Jones is SEXY!! You will enjoy the beautiful scenery and people. Nice story line but the ending was disappointing.
4,Summer 's Romance!,"This drama filled movie involves a love triangle. Summer G, who is played by actor Richard Jones, the handsome Blair Underwood as Chip Hightower, and Chenoa Maxwell as Sky Hightower are the main characters in this film. G is a famous rapper who settles in the Hamptons to be near his former college sweetheart Sky. Sky, who also lives in the Hamptons is married to Chip, a uncle Tom, conniving, philandering, stock broker. When Sky and G run into one another at one of his parties, memories of their past love resurface.Soon afterwards, things began to heat up between G and Sky and Chip doesn't like any of it. While G is willing to give up everything he's worked hard for to regain the love he's lost, Chip will do anything to keep her. A must have in the collection!"
3,"not great, but i would't want a refund...","since there is a synopsis available above, i'll skip that part. with the great gatsby as an outline, it has a good story. c cherot did a pretty good job of interpreting it. richard jones and blair underwood do an excellent job of bringing their characters to life. unfortunately, i can't say the same for most of the remaining cast. there is some humor and pull to the supporting sidebars, but overall...they fall short. ms maxwell's performance was somewhat dry and distant, was it the material? eh...i don't know. in the end, it is an entertaining movie worth seeing. just don't get too ""geeked up"" about it, or you might end up disappointed."
4,A great movie,This is one for your collections - The main characters are wonderful actors. I have known/seen Blair but not Jones. Hey! the cat is too cool!!!
1,Stop the Madnesss,"Not since ""Solo"" have I seen a movie this bad! Based on the previous reviews that I've read it appears as though everyone else saw a different movie. My curiosity certainly got the best of me with this one. The trailer caught my attention, but in the end I was left disappointed by the writing and the acting of several creditable actors. The bad part is I lost two hours of my life that I can't get back, and that irritates me. My suggesstion....keep it moving when it comes to G!"
5,A wonderful disk improved through remastering.,"Rubinstein had an almost endless repertoire through Stravinsky. He had certain preferences and there were many things he never recorded I wish he had. But he had his reasons.This disk has many nice things from some live concerts at the height of his powers. He performed the Debussy many many times and the Ondine was one of his favorite encore pieces.I enjoyed all the performances here and recommend this disk to you without reservation. I have the older release, but this one should be higher quality because of the remastering. Still, there will be some limitations in the sound because of the technologies used at the time they were originally recorded. But don't let that stop you from enjoying these treasures.Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI"
3,Incorrect transliteration tables,"This is an excellent book as an overview of the language. The problem is that the Latin transliterations for the Turkmen and Uzbek alphabets are entirely wrong from the third character to the end. I work in a library, and had consulted this book while cataloging some Uzbek and Kazakh books, when I noticed the error. This is not useful to librarians or anyone studying these languages. If there has been an errata published for the transliteration tables, it needs to be made readily available."
2,important ideas,"There are many important ideas in this book, which almost make it worth reading. Unfortunately, Dr Rubin is one of the worst writers of prose I have ever endured. She prefers fashionable jargon to plain spoken explanations, and if a page will do she writes ten. Where was her editor?"
5,Love this bag!!,I love this bag so much. I am a nurse and like to take a lot of items to work with me - this bag is just the right size for me to take the things that I need to work with me without overloading myself (I am really bad about overpacking things that I do not use!) I love this bag!!
4,From the back of the book......,"Wayfarer in the Land is an account of the evangelistic ministry of Hannah Hurnard and her colleagues as they traveled throughout Israel during the 1930's telling of the wayfaring Man who nearly 2,000 years ago sent his disciples two by two, to every place where he himself would come.When, because of political unrest, a government regulation was passed that all civilian cars be taken off the roads, what had seemed at the beginning such a stupendous and impossible task was actually accomplished. Every single place in Palestine, as far as could be ascertained, had been visited at least once. In all the thousands of miles of difficult travel they had been spared from accident and violence, and from all serious breakdowns.The daily experiences of the Lord's wonderful care and kindness recounted here will interest all readers who want to know more about the ministry of the best-selling author of Hinds' Feet on High Places."
3,Disappointed in quality but not content,"Was surprised to open this ""like new"" book and find that it appeared similar to a copied book. Some of the pages were barely legible and the quality of the cover and binding was extremely poor. The content is what I was expecting to find--accurate and complete, and of course that is what is most important. However, knowing that this was a very expensive book when new, it's impossible to believe that the one I received was a used version of an original."
2,Disappointed,"For the amount of money I paid, I was very shocked to receive a used library book. I understood it was a used book, but this was definately not worth what I paid for it."
5,Gets better the more you listen,"I've had this CD for a few years, but I never quite understood their sound until I had the pleasure of seeing them in concert in Galway, Ireland while I was there for several months. Since then I've had a renewed interest in this CD and their music and general, and here is why. These talented musicians have such a strong understanding of the music, and their arrangements of the tunes are unbelievable. Low whistles aren't exactly common-place as the lead instruments in Irish music, but Lunasa proves that they can be. The way they take traditional tunes and layer the various parts turns the music into a true work of art. The more I listen to Irish music and develop my own abilities as an Irish flutist, the more I understand how amazing Lunasa's approach to music really is. Buy this CD and really pay attention to every detail. You will be amazed."
4,Outstanding instrumental music,A great album by a great band. I saw them live in Belgium and they were outstanding. The only thing I miss is a singer but if you like Irish music enough that is ok.
2,"It works, but performance is sub-par","This DVD burner is very convenient to istall: all a user has to do is load the software from a CD and plug the drive into the USB port. It does work reasonably well, although it won't meet it's advertised speed rating. I've tried it with several different kinds of 16X disks, and the best it can do is 8X.I tried to check the firmwere version, but there's no way to talk to the drive to read the version number, and the supplied Auto-Upgrade software doesn't work anyway. I bought the drive because of a very generous $50 reabate offer, but the old axiom is true: you get what you pay for.Next time, I'll buy a recognized name brand with good industry reviews and pay less attention to a cheap price."
5,Folk Resurgence,"Boot's Virvla is exemplary material for why Folk music is in resurgence. Virvla's got dominant Nordic folk roots, with varied instrumentation, but not with the overkill that makes it culturally unidentifiable. And it doesn't use extremes (either by utilizing technology or in its variety) that some artists can apply to folk music, which often tends to strip the soul out of it by removing the sensitivity of the folk element. The melodies are strong and clever, and the percussive accompaniment is well thought out to provide pulse and building -- all in service of the music as a whole.The Enhanced CD has two lovely but short videos on it if the performance of 2 of the works, with traditional dancing.Though I collect folk music & traditional music from all around the world, this was the first Nordic album that really grabbed me. I would highly recommend this for people that like or play Greek, Cretan, Irish, or Balkan folk music."
2,Nowhere near Lynda S Robinson and boring,"I started reading this book with great anticipation but was soon disapointed, both with the plot and the description of ancient Egypt. The reader is not transfer to that era and place."
1,"A good effort, but disappointing","Lt. Bak while undoubtedly an interesting character does not have a very interesting story or plot in which to reveal himself. The story is lacking in description and is pre-occupied with the ""manure"" smell of Egypt, rather than the color and feel of the land. Too much detail is put on the shipping trade and not enough into the characters and depth of the characters in it. It lacks color, emotion, depth and does not transport one to Egypt as do most of the novels I have read."
4,Husband thinks it is helping,"Our Jack is 13 years old, and the wear and tear of her active life has been showing especially in her back legs. She had ACL surgery in one hind knee, but she still suffers from some discomfort. Her hind legs will shake when she gets tired. We ordered this product because our vet recommended it and because of the reviews. My husband who is with our dog all day thinks he has noticed an improvement in her. I too think she seems better. We are only one month into the product use and will continue to use it. She is picky eater, but she does not mind that we sprinkle the capsule into her food."
2,They're ok,"This band is good, not great. Nothing too original here. Song 5 or 6 is cool. I was a little disappointed when i listened to this album, but hey what can i do? this band has potential, but most of it is unused."
3,Decent instructional video for 1 on 1 offense,"Good video for players with some basketball experience teaching drills and basic offensive moves. Coach Pitino and his players briefly demonstrate some drills for mid-range shooting, a couple of basic low post moves, and also some guidelines for warming up and 3-point shooting.This video does not cover team offense, passing, rebounding, or defense. It is also not for the beginning player seeking to gain a basic understanding of basketball. With that said, the information that is presented is worth 80 minutes of your time."
4,From The 27th State or Florida,This is a wonderful cd. The two bands together play for you some of the most beautiful music in the world. They know how to draw you in and really make you feel good. Pretty good vocals and some really awesome guitars! You will love it. If there is one emo cd that you should own it is this one.
4,"well, the first half...","my friend was ranting and raving about this split, so, to oblige him, i picked it up here at good old amazon.com. i can't say that he was completely right in saying that this was a phenomenal disc. the three songs by further seems forever are extraordinary, especially ""new year's project"". and yes kids, that is a llllleeeeeaaaaaddddd guitar that you are hearing. no more of this rhythm only thing. i can't wait to get their full length that will be out on tooth and nail in the future.i was dissapointed by the recess theory. the songs were decently crafted and the singer has an interesting voice, but i was not blown away. the guitar lines were a little too dissonant for me and the mix was a little off. nonetheless, a decent band. so, if you are looking to get some new melodic emo-pop rock stuff, this might just be the disk for you."
4,This was not at all the way Jennie had planned...,"to begin her search for excitement and a husband...With her new inheritance and her quick wit, the former headmistress - endeavoring to sweeten her astringent reputation -was en route to the London Marriage Mart to let fate and forture take their course.She arrived at the Laughing Jack Inn in time to wield her acerbic tongue against a handsome gentleman and his unhappy companion - a lady scandalously young enough to be his daughter. The youthful miss, however, was indeed Lord Marndale's daughter.After hotheaded remarks and apologies all around, Marndale's outrage turned to admiration. Miss Jennie Robsjohn would brook no nonsense from anyone - not even eligible gentlemen - and certainly would make a perfect companion for his willful young daughter. Perhaps, she would prove ideal for someone else as well..."
5,Super well done album,"A relaxing well done no nonsense album, just full of good picking and listening. Every song is a winner. If you are a country fan, the country hits half of this two-fer is for you."
1,"Typhoon Vintage Kitchen Mixing Bowls, Set of 3, Pink","After two attempts to send me a complete unbroken set, and that failed, I had to wait forever for a refund.I asked that you just send a replacement each time for the broken bowls and that was not a possibility."
4,Dune to Death,"Judith McMonigle and her new husband, Police Lieutenenat Joe Flynn, set off optimistically for the Oregon coast to spend their honeymoon. A dune buggy accident sends Joe to the hospital and leaves Judith alone in a spacious cottage. She decides to ask her cousin Renie to come and keep her company while Joe is on the mend. As soon as Renie arrives, the cousins find a dead body, that of their landlady. They become involved in the tangled affairs of the the landlady's family and their past, as they conduct their own investigation of the murder. Another dead body appears and the cousins become even more confused about the identity of the perpretrator. This is another entertaining ""cozy"" from the dependable Judith Daheim and should be pleasing to her fans."
4,Duned to Dance,This is a very entertaining mystery. Mary is quite inventive with her mysteries. I really liked this humorous tale of sleuth's Judith and cousin Renie. You can't go wrong with Mary Daheim.
4,Classic Judith,"Just to show no matter when or where Judith goes, the mysteries follow. That it happens on her honeymoon does not negate Renie's presence since Joe ends up in the hospital. A great place for him considering his attitude in the books that follow. I admit that this is probably one of the few books that Joe and his demeaning attitude takes a break. A fun little read for the evening."
2,Creed of Iron needs sources and better artwork,"Do not get me wrong... The book is an interesting read and should at least help wake the millions of slumbering folk by at least making people think about something other than coffee, SUV's and work. It is even a pleasurable read, but come on... No sources???? It would be nice to know where the author got some of his claims and ""facts"" if not only for the purpose of chasing down further reading. With no sources the entire book is weakened and really is just the opinions of 14 words press. Therefore, it comes off as a little too much like a sermon, rather than serious philosophical thought. A further problem is the simplistic childish artwork. I felt like I was reading a childrens book at times. One would do much better to read something historical or by Thorsson."
1,Unscholarly work,Does this author even use one source book? All of his theories have holes in them. This book is purely opinionated without an ounce of solid evidence to back it up.
1,Inaccurate and Offensive,"If you want to know about the ancient pre-Christian religion of Northern Europe, read the Eddas, or books by Edred Thorsson and Freya Aswynn. If you want to see the old Gods blasphemed by someone who doesn't actually believe they are real, but wants to use the cover of religion to cloak racist politics, by all means buy this book."
1,Racist junk,"It needs to be said that this book and others from 14 words press are racist. They are way outside the mainstream of Asatru and Nordic/Germanic heathenry, and their ideas should not be taken as typical of these folks. Most of their support comes from prisons, and is considered to be extremist and radical by most other heathens. The only reason to read this book is to familiarize yourself with the morally corrupt ideas of the enemy."
1,Racist trash,"I am a folkish heathen and even I have a hard time reading this crap. David Lane, Ron McVan and the vast majority of the 14 words press are all former members of the radical racist Christian Identity movement. These people do not believe in the gods, they use them as a tool, a cloak to obfuscate their obviously hateful agenda. I have one word for ""Creed of Iron"" and the rest of the 14 words publications... UTGARD!"
1,Racist Propaganda- NOT HEATHENRY,"Another supremacist propaganda rag from 14 words press about Aryan superiority. The fourteen words the press refers to deal with ""securing the future of white children"". Amazon censors, please stop profiteering from racist propaganda like this and drop 14 words press as a client, they do not represent the Asatru faith fairly. Mc Van lays out a twisted and paraniod version of dead gods, with Wotan as a symbol of an awakened racial consciousness. Woden is one of the high gods in the heathen religion. Our Troth, Teutonic Religion, and the Poetic Edda are much more constructive and educational books to read about heathenism and Asatru. I have no idea what Mc Van is about, but clearly he puts politics before the heathen gods."
5,Creed is essential,"Some people read various meditation books to jump start their days. My day is kicked into overdrive by this astounding book. If 6 stars were possible, that is what it would rate as it is an honest, read; real assessment of our Nordic heritage. It is not perfect and I would not want it to be. The effect of a graphic in the book is one I can't forget, it has a Viking that speaks a thousand languages but only one translated, the heart. It is also technical in that it has the ancient holidays and the mysterious tree of life. It is indeed a book that you cannot allow to sit idle for long as it calls out as the runes it discusses do. This must be experienced first hand to understand the effect. One last item concerning this amazing book, my little girl who is 6 loves it, and is starting to be able to read and understand it. If I were a missionary, this is the book I'd peddle."
4,Not quite a exact fit,"I received the product from the vendor on time & in good condition.The only problem I had, was the vent shade was a bit short on my car.It said it was for a 2001 Mercury Sable, but it didn't fit quite right.I'm still using the item though.Other than that, the product is as advertised."
4,a great choice,"getting into hootie and the blowfish late in the game, i was sucked in by the magnificent voice of darius rucker. i listened to clips of the songs on their other releases, and this one struck me somehow. i wasnt disappointed---darius has the greatest voice imaginable, and the lyrics have something meaningful to say---not just schmaltzy love songs. great!"
2,"It's decent, but too homogenized","Like much of mainstream American music, Hootie & The Blowfish have found their groove and settled in a little too well. The songs all sound nice, but each bleeds into the next much too easily. I would mention standout tracks to try, but when songs barely deviate from their comfortable formula of an easy tempo and the same damn three chords... Close your eyes, point, and try a sample song. If you like the thought of 12 tracks of it, you'll be quite pleased with Looking For Lucky. As for myself, I think I'll look elsewhere."
1,LOOKING FOR HITS,this album sounds as if after they finished up recording cracked rear view they suddenly all got kicked in the balls and were told to get back in the studio and immediately make another album.
1,Muhaha!,"There's nothing fundamentally wrong with college rock, but Hillbillystan college rock with lyrics so idiotic can be downright annoying for anyone concerned.I will credit them their first album which had equally silly lyrics, but was listenable, at times (with some generocity it could even pick two stars)... but this one is downright laughable."
1,a damn good joke,q:whats cheaper than blank tape and u can always find in the bargin bina: hootie and the blowfish
3,good stuff,"Hootie still has it, despite the Burger King commercial. Those looking for the band to release Cracked Rear View Part 2 won't find it here, but there are some great songs to be heard. I've noticed that on the last few albums there is a mixed bag of songs in terms of style and quality. These guys incorporate country, bluegrass, rock, pop, etc etc and for the most part it works. Keep in mind that most of the Cracked Rear View songs were several years old even when that album hit the ""big time"", so it is only natural for Hootie to move on to other material. Me personally, I don't think I ever want to hear ""hold my hand"" again, but on the flipside could listen to the hidden track ""closetful of fear"" off Musical Chairs over and over.Anyway, if you liked Hootie back in the day I think you'll dig a lot of the songs on Lucky."
4,"A quality album, with typical Hootie and The Blowfish sound","Overall, this is a good CD. The songs don't deviate much in style from much of their other material, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. It is mostly light rock/pop here, with creative lyrics throughout. I personally prefer Fairweather Johnson, the first Hootie album I ever owned. Also, there's Cracked Rear View, which has great songs but was over played. This is good new material from the band and is recommended for any Blowfish fan or people just interested in laid back rock/pop."
4,These Guys Still Rock!!,"What ever happened to these guys? I remember When Cracked Rear View came out, I remember thinking these guys are going to be the next Beetles. I guess when you release an album that's as great as CRV is you can't go any higher. Anyways these guys are awesome I miss hearing them on the radio, I hate the crap they play today."
5,PERFECT EROTIC COLLECTION!,"This is a superb collection of erotic stories. Not only is it hot, hot, hot, but fun and extremely entertaining. Each of the stories is very special...I even loved the biographies: ""He lives with his turtle and books in Augusta, Ga."""
5,"""The Reason"" I bought this...","I admit it. I bought this cd for the one track, ""The Reason."" This CD is fabulous. I like all the tracks, and was pleasantly surprised! You won't regret it, believe me!"
4,Great game! but only for older machines,"An adventure game like they used to make them -- intelligent, funny, challenging, and thought-provoking. One warning: There's a major bug about a third of the way through the game that crashes the game to the desktop on machines running Win98 or later. The manufacturer's solution? Download a saved game from their website that picks up after the problem. Better than nothing, I suppose."
2,No Big Surprise,":::sigh:::What can I say about Nightlong? It's tedious, the voice acting is pathetic, the graphics are strange, and the plot is nearly non-existant. This game ignores the details of the storyline, and puts forth all their efforts into opening doors and collecting dead rats. I was expecting an in-depth and interesting game, but was greatly disappointed in the end. There were so many areas where the creators could have pushed the story along to make it more intriuging, but of course they did not.Also, the puzzles are NOT logical. They're like standardized tests, only once correct answer when there are more possible ones. Lots of pixle searching, which drove me to read a walkthrough. And, with that, it only took me about ten hours to complete the game.Maybe my expectations were too high, I was hoping for another The Longest Journey. But, in any case, this game fizzled out long before the climax."
4,Runs on Windows 7 64-bit,Thought folks would like to know this game runs fine on Windows 7. I'm an old adventure game fan and if you played and liked Blade Runner you will probably like this game also.Just right click on the setup.exe file on the first CD and choose to install in Windows 95 compatibility mode. Worked for me.There is a bug in the game which makes it crash at a certain part on newer systems beyond the Windows 98 period. There is a save game file available to get past the crash point or you can use a virtual machine emulator to play the game.Still worth the hassle IMO if you like these types of games.
3,play along the nightlong,"a decent game, what you would expect from a quality company such as dreamcatcher, however , gameplay very slow and redundant, graphics are very good when you go to cut scenes, other wise basic gameplay is fuzzy, with no way to increase video display, with my geforce 4600 it begs to be challangeda good game at 10 bucks, worth it"
2,Ok Game,"Some flaws to it. Stopped working after about an hour of play. Will try again to see if problem continues the next time it is played. Otherwise, an okay game. Graphics not very good, but storyline is interesting and exciting."
2,Obscureness runs amuck,"Story line is intriguing, but some puzzles are too obscure to be fun. Although ""anyone"" could get them after awhile, after awhile, I could care less. If you get it on sale and need an adventure game fix, get it. If not, just be productive and mow the lawn."
1,dishonest company,This antenna will not pick up all the channels and the company is not willing to admit that they sold me the wrong antenna !!! They will not exchange it !!!
4,Swiss Army,"So far so good with this watch. Very good deal an quality for the preice. Usually, you can't go wrong with swiss army."
5,Marshal Field is an Icon,Anyone from the midwest knows about The Marshall Field store in Chicago. This book is charming and leads the reader through a past that is no more and is sorely missed!
4,Still the Blasters,"This is the Blasters first studio album since their original run ended in the 1980s. So there are no Dave Alvin songs or guitar solos here. That said, this is still a good record. Phil Alvin sounds as great as ever, embodying the songs with his big voice and big personality. John Bazz also remains from the original lineup. The new members fit well, and the songs are great. My only quibble is that there are no songwriting credits. I recognize a lot of the tracks as being old songs, but is the entire album covers? Are any of these originals?And on a final note, could somebody PLEASE reissue Phil Alvin's incredible first solo album, ""(Un)Sung Stories"" on CD?!"
4,4-11-44 Blast Off,"""4-11-44"" is as good as its gonna get without Dave Alvin. This is classic rockabilly blues. Phil Alvin's voice is like hearing an old friend and ""on the rebound"" would make Charlie Rich Proud. If you pine for the past (the 50's, 60's and The 80's) this is where it's at. Buy Now."
4,Great sound,"Very good CD.Would have been nice to have Dave Alvin on lead guitar and writing all the songs ,but hey there could be another reunion gig at any time.His replacement is very good on lead guitar.Dave did let `em use one of his songs on this project.That is ""Dry River"".Phil`s voice is sounding even better as he gets older."
2,"As a phone 0 stars, as email 5 stars","What to say. I have had cellular phones for nearly 20 years. Bag Phones, Bricks, Flip Phones, but none of the relics could compare to this piece of junk PHONE.Touch any button while trying to answer or use the phone and you will disconnect. Try to end a call, opposite result. How many friends have told me ""Heard you shopping at Costco""Ringer - Damn near impossible to hear. Genius response fron NEXTEL "" Oh yeah, those aren't very loud. Can I help with anything else""Battery runs dead quick. Once you plug in, 10 to 15 minute wait until PHONE has enough power. Total hassle if in a hurry.EMAIL DEVICE - No complaints. Actually can open mail that OUTLOOK will not open.SUMMARY - As a phone, buy some string and two tin cans. As an EMAIL device, pretty good. (Sure there is better by now!)"
2,I'm the first person to review this CD,"It doesn't completely bite, sounds like AC/DC meets the Sex Pistols. Both bands are better too."
3,Helpful supplementary study resource,I got some interesting insights out of this book during my recent 18-month study of Romans - enough for this book to be worth the purchase price. But don't get it as your primary study resource.
4,"Another great NorthSide sampler, still ""cheaper than food""","This is the second sampler of recording artists on the NorthSide label who play traditional folk styles from Scandinavia with varying degrees of modern touches thrown in, from Hoven Droven's full-blown rock to Annbjorg Lien's Middle Eastern touches to Wimme's ambient electronics. The music is like a moodier variation on Celtic music. Many of the pieces are instrumentals, and there are fiddles a-plenty throughout (but drums are rare). This CD is at least as good as the first, and maybe a hair better. Hedningarna and Wimme's pieces are more accessible than on the previous CD. This time around, every group only gets one track. Varttina's ""The Village Awaits the New Moon"" is the definite highlight."
4,The Best Of the NorthSide Samplers,"Again, NorthSide brings us some wonderful samples from the fertile Scandinavian folk scene on this Nordic Roots 2 CD. After taking a chance on the first one (after all, it was so cheap!) and being wowed, I had to get this one. Many of the same artistes from the previous collection can be found here, along with other interesting groups. From the infectious openers Vildhonung (Wild Honey) from Boot and Mettsän Tytto (Forest Maiden) from Hedningarna, through ultra modern twists from Garmarna (Vedergällningen, or Vengeance), Sorten Muld (2 Sstre, or 2 Sisters), to the jazz stylings of Lavalek by Groupa and the driving hard rock of Brekken by Hoven Droven, one would have to be dead not to find something to like here. Just one warning: this stuff is addictive."
2,Bamboozled,I grew up listening to Jimmy Briscoe and the Little Beavers and their ballads were always my favorites. Where were you (when I needed you) was not on this cd and I am very disappointed. Who the heck wants the theme song to any of the songs that were on the cd????????? My Ebony Princess and Forever were the only songs I enjoyed off the whole cd. I feel used.
3,Basic but with great illustrations,"This book is is a great summary/basic pathophysiology book. It has about 430 pages of disorders usually allotting one page to the pathophysiology and another devoted to an illustration. The illustrations are really great, but the patho part does not contain as much detail as I would like for this type of reference tool. It's a good basic book, but if you need more substance you will have to supplement your work with another reference."
5,great reference,When ever I have a patient with a certain pathophysiology i refer to this manual for any information i may need concerning it.Great tool!
5,Excellent book...,"I used this book as a replacement for the sad excuse of a textbook they made us use for my Pathophysiology class. I, personally, love that this book is straight to the point. No messing around with filler garbage. All text is presented in an easy to understand bullet-point format. I have found this book to be an irreplaceable reference. I am extremely excited that I am now able to DL it to my kindle."
5,Atlas of Pathophysiology,"I downloaded to my ipad. A very good edition and so much better to reference on the iPad, or a ereader of some type. Very well written and up to date. Worth every dime. Thank you."
1,don't waste your money,"In my opinion the pictures aren't very schematic (they don't show pathophysiological proces, or if they do it's only very external)there isn't any connection between pictures and textIf I can choose again, I would buy Atlas of phatophysilogy from thieme :)"
2,Bit Boring!,I thought this book drags out and could never really get into because it just lacked spirit for a holiday read.
4,Kids loved this,"Every year I read to my kids (no matter how old). I did a few stories from this, and they loved it. Made the holiday special."
2,A View From A Time Gone By,"I guess the best thing you can say about this film is that it gives the audience a sense of what gay life must have been like prior to the aids epedemic.The acting is not very good, the editing is terrible, the film quality is poor and the sound is bad.The best aspect of the film is the feature debut of Jane Olivor who sings a great rendition of ""Pretty Girl"" It is great to see her in performance from her early days in the business. Sometimes, however, the movement of her mouth and the sound of the film do not match.I also enjoyed the drag show with Diana Ross and Judy Garland.All in all, not a great movie, but its less than 90 minutes long so its worth a viewing...."
1,Academy Award Nomination for WORST FILM EVER MADE!!!,"I spent most of my Saturday Nights at the ""Tubs."" I enjoyed every minute, every man, every assignation and, of course, Bette Midler.I am ashamed that anyone would put this trash out as a representative example of a segment of gay life during that period. The film has the look of a terribly made home movie with a bunch of people (I won't refer to them as Actors) doing bad impersonations of what they thought gay men were supposed to be like.How tiresome. How pathetic!I don't think they even deserve the one (1) star I gave them. Perhaps a few dozen ripe tomatos would be more appropriate.BOO!!!"
1,Disappointment,"This is not a good movie, regardless of the fact that it is gay-positive, filmed in a repressive era. The quality of the filming an be excused, given the technology of the period. But the acting is naive and amateurish at best. So is the story line. I would have like more documentary about the baths rather than the silly love story between a gay-curious man and a young woman. There was more almost-explicit sex between them than the implied sex between the young man and an out gay character. The ""straight couple"" display full nudity. None of the gay characters do. A big disappointment on all counts."
3,saturday night at the baths-directors cut,"good, is more of a documentary instead of a moviewas and adult film when 1st screened, but is very tame bytodays standards"
2,Two stars for a glimpse at the Continental Baths,"other than that this movie is quite awful. The lead actor, in particular, creeped me out. His grilfriend here looks like a buck-toothed Mia Farrow and was just too liberal and giggly. Not much to the story and really dull as well. Cool to get a glimpse of the Continental, but turn the sound off and FF as much as possible."
2,Didn't enjoy it,I am 8 years old and I didnt enjoy this kit. Unable to use perfume and I didnt like the crystals.
4,Kind of cheesy,"It really is a cheesy movie, but I still like it. My kids, especially my 6 year old son, love the ""thing"". :)"
2,Lame,"The story of 4 astronauts who get caught in a solar storm and survive, but with their DNA severely altered. They develop superpowers and become the Fantastic Four. I didn't read the comic books so I don't care how it stacks up to them. The movie taken by itself is pretty bad. There is very little set-up to explain who everyone is and what exactly they're doing in space. In fact, throughout the entire movie there is little character development. The only person who actually acts in the film is Michael Chiklis as The Thing. Everyone else give awful performances, especially Jessica Alba. They're not helped by the atrocious dialog they have to say. The script must have taken about 20 minutes to write. I gave it 2 stars because I've seen worse movies and there are a few good effects sequences, especially at the end."
1,Fantastic Bore,"I was looking forward to this movie until I heard the reviews. I made the choice to rent it and i was not impressed. The movie was deeply flawed. For one thing, the heroes of the movie recieved amazing powers and acting like there was no big deal. The human torch for example, was setting his sun on fire just to impress women. Also, the Thing has nothing to say but ""I'm the Thing now. Hmmm what a bummer"". Another flaw is that the fantastic four seem to be causing most of the trouble, and people are applauding them.One more flaw, why is Jessica Alba the invisible girl? That is a horrible move to make. I want to see her at all times.The movie may be called the Fantastic Four, but this movie isn't even close to fantastic. In fact, this is one of the worst movies of 2005."
3,Not so fantastic,"There are two ways to go on a comic book adaptation. You can do a serious take, as in spiderman, or you can do a comic book take, as in Dick Tracy.The Fantastic Four gets stuck somewhere in the middle. It tries to do a serious take on the film while at the same time trying to be comical and lighthearted. In my opinion it comes up short on both.The character development is very weak, even if you have minor knowledge of the storyline and characters it still is not enough. You need to have been a real fan of the comic books for the story to work.All in all the movie comes out rather flat. So much more could have been done with this thst it ends up being rather disappointing."
3,Keep your expectations low and enjoy the low rent fireworks.,"Fantastic Four has the feel of the Marvel projects of old -- a kind of low rent kitch with linear plots and questionable special effects. It's more of an amusement park ride than a movie, and a lot like those modern roller coasters that are fast, comfortable, and amusing -- never dangerous or shocking.So, enjoy the Thing stopping an 18-wheeler, the Human Torch taking a guided missile on a race across the city, Jessica Alba in modest underwear, and a geeky Reed Richards slipping his hand under a door. It's a summer diversion like a fat marshmallow squished between two grahams and slathered in melted Hershey's chocolate."
2,Shockingly BAD! But watch it anyway,"This is a terrible movie, seriously this is one time when you should beleive the press, it is awful! In a shock move, however, I am going to recommend it. If you are reading these reviews then you likely enjoy the genere and if that is the case then you will glean enough entertainment out of the 3 of four quality movie moments in the movie to make it a worthwhile investment of 90 minutes.That said, whatever you do - DO NOT buy this movie. Rent it, wait for it to show in HBO in HD or even make it to regular cable but dropping hard earned green on this flick would be a travesty."
1,Silly 4,"This movie is just plain silly and dumb. Another reviewer has already mentioned Ben's wife coming out in her nighty. Why does Sue Storm have to turn invisible to get by the crowd when Ben and Richards just walk through it? Why do the 4 pay attention to their ""symptoms"" and totally ignore Von Dooms? These conversations in front of crowds were equally stupid. There is no reason why Ben would want to stay in his state after the fight was over.What kind of a ""scientist"" thinks that Johnny getting to 5K Kelvin would ""ignite"" the atmosphere and destroy the planet?I still find it hard to believe that people throw millions of dollars at a project and yet not spend any of that money on a good story. Surely millions at something would mean attention to detail right? I guess the dollar just doesn't go as far as it used to."
2,Save your money and just rent this one....,"I judge films on the genre and when you have wonderful comic book films that come to life like Spiderman ,the X Men and Batman, then you know that it is not impossible to write a decent film with protagonists that happen to have super abilities. That being said, I felt that the Fantastic Four went the way of Ang Lee's Hulk. The actors are likable, but the script is ridiculous. The only character remotely four dimensional is The Human Torch. Reed and Susan have no chemistry at all. Michael Chiklis comes close to bringing the Thing to life, but he is so bitter that it is not worth watching. Of course, I thought the scenes with the Invisible girl being left in her underwear were gratuitous, but if you got it flaunt it. Von Doom sucked out what life the picture may have had.Overall, I was glad someone treated me to this turkey. I would have hated to pay money for it."
2,Some good scenes but I can't recommend it,"Long story short, I liked Fantastic Four. It had it's faults, mainly it's portrayal of Dr. Doom, but it was fun. I was disappointed in the extended cut though. Most of the added scenes were OK. More character development, more story, a reference to the Puppet Master and that Herbie robot, but in the end, it felt as though they just Frankensteined this thing together from leftover parts. The scenes with Reed and Sue in the planetarium then again on the bridge being the exact same scene was the worst offender. And the part where Alicia gives Thing a spongebath just felt wrong on so many levels. There were a couple of interesting documentaries and the original version is thoughtfully included on this disc so for those who haven't bought it yet. All in all, worth watching just to see what could've been but it's no improvement over the original."
3,"good movie, not great, but good","My title pretty much sums it up. The casting was okay (but Jessica Alba as Sue Storm? C'mon!), the special effects were cool, and the plot was like something out of an FF comic. People have a tendency to look down on this one because it didn't live up to the epic expectations of X-Men or Spider-Man. However, anyone who knows the FF comic series knows that they are not grand-scale moral/ethical pieces like the aforementioned titles; FF is just good clean sci-fi fun. The script kept in line with the modern comic scripts, maintaining each character's basic vernacular. The group's dynamics were emphasized well and weren't overdone. Overall, it was an entertaining movie. Still better than Daredevil and Electra."
3,Better than reviewers said,But... Not exactly riveting entertainment. Great for a Friday night veg out though.
3,Series Possibilities,"Entertaining new addition to the comic book genre. Has possibilities as a series, but almost doesn't cut it by itself. Good effects, and looks, but they are the looks of most of the other comic movies. The story focused on letting you get to know the characters, which was nice. Unfortunately I didn't feel that they fed you into to the plot properly by building up the events leading to the creation of our superheroes. The actors did an okay job trying to portray their characters, unfortunately the writers decided to split up the lines evenly between the characters, I am guessing so no one felt left out. (And why would a girl want to be invisible, when she decides to wear the clothes they put our heroine in.) Unfortunately this movie didn't stand out against the other Marvel Comic legends, so I would only give it 3 stars, because it was a mediocre film."
2,It could have been better,"I wonder how can a movie with The Shield star Michael Chiklis and Nip/Tuck star Julian McMahon be so dull. The Fantastic Four was my favorite superhero comic book when I was a kid. In fact, it was the only one I would buy. Like most girls, I preferred the Archie books. There was one fun scene where The Thing tries to help someone who was going to commit suicide. All the superheros joined in to help and the world got to see their superpowers. But in general, it was unexciting. It should have been so much better."
4,Fantastic 4 stars.,"I won't say this is the best comic-to-film movie I've ever seen, but it was just what I was hoping for. It's simple fun, and decent action. A good mix of humor and action too. Five people in space, things go bad, all gain powers, four of them are used for good. I liked the effects quite a bit actually. The Torch and Mr. Fantastic were both done well, and I'm glad they used a costume for the Thing, instead of doing CGI like in The Hulk. It was more realistic. As for The Invisible Woman...wow. Turning invisible is a cool trick, but her super-power is clearly being smoking hot. I'd like to have seen alot more, and not less. Overall a good buy for comic/action fans, and will go great next to your Spiderman and X-men DVD's."
3,It Could Have Been So Much More,This film was going to be a wonderful superhero film. It would stand among spiderman and the original batman as the greatest of their genre. With 4 cool heroes and one sweet villain and more action scenes than you can handle what could go wrong? The stupid jokes. I'm not saying the jokes are bad they're funny but they don't belong here. Sure every superhero film needs a little humor but theres never a minute when the jokes let up. Spiderman was a great revival for superhero movies showing they can actually be serious and have emotional performances. But here comes Fantastic 4 destroying that idea. I guess we'll just have to resort to stupid little incredible hulk crap...
4,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!,"This is a great movie! It is one of the best movies of the year. A great storyline,action special effects,Drama acting and more! It is a very great superhero movie. I went into the theater thinking that it willbe action packed! And it wasnt really. it was a mixture of things. My only complaint is it could of had more action. A scene in the middle and a big scene at the end. But still a great movie."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With terrible acting (exception: Michael Chiklis), terrible special effects, annoying character interaction and a paint-by-numbers plot, Fantastic Four has precious little to recommend it."
2,Waste of Time,"this is not a good movie. i would not reccomend it at all, being that it is dull and tries too hard to make itself into a good action superhero movie. basically, the best parts of this movie are shown in the previews. again, i would not reccomend this movie. you would be much better off renting one of the Spiderman or Batman movies."
3,An Ok Show,"As a fan of the comics for years I was excited to see the adaptation to the big screen of many of my childhood heroes. This film is long on special effects and has a lot of fun action. But it lacks the story and acting that have made the early Spider Man and X-Men films fun to watch. It is still worth seeing, but it could have been much better."
2,Unimaginative and misguided.,"The overall plot of ""Fantastic Four"" is classic and decent and I don't mind the screenwriters attempting to add humor and romance to the action and sci-fi. A more lighthearted tone to appeal to all types of audiences was a good idea. But the film fails because most of the actors in the film are totally miscast (with the exception of Chris Evans). They deliver their lines with so much cheese that the humor and romance seem silly and the drama, action and science-fiction elements seen hokey. It's a shame because this could have been exciting and imaginative. I think that the worst part of the film is that director Tim Story has no sense of how to properly edit an action scene. Add that to the horrendous visual effects and you have for a pretty disappointing film."
3,I wish....,There was a longer version of this. It just seemed to lack something. Kind of dull after all of the hype. I hope there is a part 2 and it is a lot better than this.
4,Good movie..,"I'll be the first to admit. Fantastic Four has found a way into my ""guilty pleasure"" movies. I hear people go on and on about how it wasn't so great, that it was bad, etc. I, however, enjoyed it immensely.I'm not going to review the movie itself...since it would be like beating a dead horse. What I will speak about is the picture quality of this BD.The transfer is done by using a MPG2 codec. Unfortunately, while the codec can produce an excellent high def transfer, it requires a lot of disk space; for this transfer, a 25GB BD disk was used, which is not enough for the better MPG2 transfers. With that said, however, the quality is not bad at all. I wouldn't put it up there with the best, but it's definetly a big jump from regular DVD, and your eyes will be pleased."
2,It wasn't that good,I was kind of disapointed with this movie. I'm 15 years old so i know my movies. It was not good only because they spent too much time fighting with themselves that their enemies. It wasn't that good.
4,Surprised,"i expected this film to suck. Totally. I was surprised to see that it actually watchable. And pretty good! The story was solid, the charcters were treated pretty evenly, not too much focus on any one. The acting was believable. I wanted to hate it but I ended up liking this movie."
2,what was that?,"First of all, if a movie takes over an hour to build up the chracter of a villain , it should take more than ten seconds before that villain's wrath is over and done with. I like that a million comic book movies come out each year, but they should force the screenwriters of each one to read the comics and at least be true to the content for the sake of hard-core comic book fans like myself. Doctor Doom could take on these four punks and an army of other heros and not break a sweat, and anyone that is going to see this movie should realize that."
2,awful,"This movie highly disappointed me. The second one was a lot better. This movie had dumb jokes thrown in and a lot of stupid lines. The visual affects were pretty good which made me give this 2 stars. Worth a rent, that's all."
4,I'm a purist,"Okay, first, I'm angry because the original FF concept has been jettisoned for something different -- a la Spiderman, in fact.But then it occurred to me: the original FF was almost 50 years ago, from a time so quaInt, 6-year-olds wouldn't buy it.With that in mind, it's not bad.Jessica Alba is NOT Sue Storm. Sorry. ain't gonna happen, she's cute and all but NOT Sue Storm.Failing that, the cast isn't too bad.The special effects are necessarily 21st-centuy in nature, since this could not have been done 10 years ago.So four of five. I'd still like to see a faithful adaptation, but not likely."
5,Fantastic Four,"A must for everyone who loves superhero movies, especially those based on Marvel Comics characters. This was the original ""first family"" of superheroes created by Stan Lee. They are brought to the screen by accurately lifting them from the pages of the ocmics with their diverse personalities and petty bickering. Whether you saw it at the theater or not, this is a DVD to own, especially with the sequel only a month away."
2,Flab-tastic,"I heard this stank. Having finally watched it, I'd say it's even worse than most critics agreed back when it was released. It's more like a lame comedy than a fantasy film. See it, only if you are a hard-core fan of these comic books brought to life films."
3,A Fun Movie!,"Ang Lee's Hulk movie was hated amongst critics as this film is, and they are true opposites!""Hulk"" took itself seriously.""Fantastic Four"" didn't take itself seriously enough!""Hulk"" was heavy handed with it's psychological analysis.""Fantastic Four"" was glib with it's psychological analysis.""Hulk"" progressed slowly.""Fantastic Four"" rushes from scene to scene, at times feeling unglued.But when all is said and done, these are COMIC BOOK movies! They're not supposed to sweep the oscars. Fantastic Four is scattered and uneven, but it succeeds at being FUN... much how those Christopher Reeve superman movies were (not counting #3).And it's funny without being silly... like ""Batman and Robin.""It's fun without the heavy handed ""darkness"" of Tim Burton's ""Batman"", or ""Daredevil.""It's not as well made or as well scripted as the two ""X-Men"" or ""Spider-man"" movies ... still... It's FUN. Long live Marvel!Jeff Messenger, author of ""The Shroud of Torrington."""
3,Entertaining fluff,"Fantastic 4 is a fun, entertaining, action filled movie. The cast is pretty bad, especially Alba, who's hard to watch on screen. It's a good movie, but it's no Spiderman."
2,Fantastic Crap,"I saw this movie a couple of days ago and was anything but enthralled by this subpar superhero flick. To start the special effects are pretty bad and don't compare to any other movies of it's type. The cast at first glance seems to be acceptable, Chikilis and the guy from Nip/Tuck Jessica Alba is the only flaw i don't care she may be hot but her acting skill is comparable to Paul Walker. But the script is pretty terrible even the good actors struggle to make anything out of thier lines. The story is stupid and about 75% of the movie is a snorefest and the final act is just cliche and stupid in every way. As you all may know FOX would make a sequel out of The Passion so the next installment of Fantastic 4 will be hitting a theater near you."
2,"Horrible, horrible, horrible","...especially considering that there was some real, substantial acting talent here minus Alba, of course, whose role in any movie is mere eye candy. How many near-nudity/underwear shots were there? About 3, weren't there? Anything more would have been bordering on gratuitous...point made.To summarize briefly, most of the actors in this movie are standing around as if to say, ""Ok, Mr. Director, what do I do now?"" ""Something weird just happened...what do I do now?""Unfortunately, the plot contrivances are ploddingly predictable from the Thing's frustrations to where the internal conflicts within the group penultimately lead as well as Doom's demise (or merely defeat? muhahahahahaha!!!).I'm not looking forward to any adventuring with the 4 if the same directing/screenplay talent is employed. I only give it an additional star for the effects and the Thing's performance, despite the surreality of his surroundings."
3,Could of been better,"I was hoping for a lot more than this when I bought this movie. The premise for the movie was great, the special effects were great but the storyline was OK. It just didn't gel too well for the most part. A great movie needs a storyline no matter how great the special effects are. I just couldn't seem to relate to the characters or their feelings. It's worth watching for the effects, as long as you don't mind the storyline being weak."
4,Another worthy comic-to-movie title,"Fantastic Four was beautiful. Everything about it, excluding Dr.Doom was almost accurate. I agree some parts of the movie were meaningless or 'rushed' but panned out to be one hell of a sci-fi action flick. The characters were played perfectly by the actors, such as Mr.Fantastic's geekish behaviour potrayed by Ioan Gruffudd, to the cockyness of Johnny Storm played by Chris Evans. If you're into the comic fest of today and enjoyed many of today's string of comic-to-movie madness such as Spider-Man and Batman Begins, then get this."
3,Decent superhero film.,"With Hollywood's overload of superhero movies over the past 3 years, this one is ""just another one of them."" But I mean it in a good way. This film does a good job of equally focusing on each of the four heroes' powers and how they personally deal with them.Jessica Alba has really emerged as a beautiful woman and a pretty good actress. She provides good eye candy. The Thing is the best part of the film. It's quite sad watching him try to adapt to being huge and made of rock. It's amusing to watch himself hate the way he is for being so different. You kind of feel sorry for him throughout the film.I do regret the lack of action in this film. But, that does leave a good door open for a sequel especially since this film is doing well at the box office.Good summer popcorn action flick."
3,OVERPRICED ?,"I'm really excited that FOX is finally releasing some of it's catalog titles on Blu-Ray. But these titles are exactly that catalog titles, that are priced higher than most studios day and date releases. The picture and sound quality are on par with Sony / Warner Bros. / Paramount / Disney, not any better or worse. The ""extras"" are sorely missing. I'm really getting tired of certain studios setting up for the ""double dip"" by not including the basic extras from their dvd couterparts. Yes, I did purchase this movie, but I feel cheated having to pay this much to enjoy the Fantastic Four in Hi-def, when M:I:3 looks a lot better, is packed with features, and costs less. Come on Sony, Fox, & Disney step up your Hi-def game."
2,See what happens when you DON'T take the material seriously..,"Wow. What happened to this film? It was supposed to be this Summer's big hit. While watching this movie at the local $2 theatre, the answer came to me: Design by committee. A bunch of Hollywood execs got together to create this movie. Why else would they cast Jessica Alba as Sue Richards?This also explains why Doctor Doom looks like a big green, corny dialog spewing Van Der Graf generator.Fantastic Four was supposed to be this big blockbuster but hype can only carry a movie so far. If the makers of this loud movie bothered to pick up and read one FF comic, I think that the movie would have been alot better."
4,Not Bad,"They played it safe with this one and I for one am very happy they did. Having worked for Marvel and also being a big Marvel fan I was so afraid Hollywood would fak this up like they did with The Hulk, Daredevil and The Punisher I did not see it till now. It's not as good as X-Men but good enough for me to buy it."
4,Storm clouds Doom's future,"Cosmic energy in a cloudFive people up in orbitThe cloud blows in a bit too soonZaps them, and they absorb itOne heats up, one fades awayOne stretches to the maxThe fourth one's like a lump of stoneAll full of craggy cracksThe fifth one's also feeling itHe's on the darker sideThere's nothing he can nip and tuckTo mask his metal hideDoom hates Richards to the coreIt's over Storm they rageHe's not prepared to lose it allAnd plots to clear the stageHis power grows, he has controlOf energy resourcesIt's up to the Fantastic FourTo make him hold his horsesThe movie's good, but not too deepNo background on the playersAlthough it's shallow, it's a blastSo ignore all those nay-sayersAmanda Richards, December 23, 2005"
1,Pretentious worthless garbage!,"Insipid characters, really poor acting, bad script and lack of any good dialogue, ""Fantastic Four"" is just a joke and the studio once again fails to adapt this comic franchise onto the big screen well. Sorry guys, try again!"
1,Don't buy,"I'm not even going to tell you whether I liked the movie or not*, I'm just writing to say that any DVD that puts unstoppable ads and previews in the beginning will never see my money; I rented it, but won't be recommending it to anyone and definitely won't be buying it. I sat through ten minutes of this junk when I put the DVD in; can't get to the menu, can't fast forward, can't even stop it if you want to. They can blow me.*Alright fine, I liked it. It's not great, but it's fun."
4,Good fun.,"I am very partial to movies made from comic books, somehow, and this film did not disappoint.I thought the plot was pretty good, and I thoroughly enjoyed looking at the leads (wow, that Julian McMahon is a beautiful man). This movie had lots of action, nicely implemented special effects, and a satisfyingly vague ending. Will there be a sequel?? Hmmmmmmm...I didn't give this movie 5 stars because I have seen other comic books transferred to movies that were more gripping, but I would still heartily recommend ""Fantastic Four"". It was fantastic! :p"
3,"OK, MOVIE","i SAW THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS, i JUST THOUGHT THAT IT WAS JUST OK. tHEY ALSO RUSSED THE STORY TO FAST. i RECOMEND RENTING IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT!"
2,So So...,"Ok special effects...The story line seemed just a bit thin...also, there was no need for cursing the name of God...So...only 2 stars...glad I did not buy the movie...just checked it out from the library..."
3,They need to make Infinity Gauntlet already.,"How many more comic book films will we have to endure before they make Infinity Gauntlet, which is a series that involves Spider Man, Hulk, some of the Fantastic Four, Captain America, Cyclops and Wolverine, etc?Oh well. Until then, we'll have to deal with the many back stories on our favorite childhood heroes. This film captures the story of the Fantastic Four pretty well. The acting was better than I thought it would be but the film seems to peak too early and Doctor Doom (our antagonist) is dispelled too quickly in my opinion.I guess my largest complaint is that with all the comic book movies coming out, I thought this one would stand out a bit more. I didn't."
3,Fun but Not Fantastic,"When compared to movies like Spiderman 2 and The Incredibles, it is only so-so. But next to Catwoman, Fantastic Four is glorious Oscar material!"
4,Not fantastic but good,"It wasnt fantastic but it was good. Had a lot of laughs and action and o yea thats right Jessica Alba. So even if it did sucked which it didnt but if it did sucked it still has her in it and thats sweet cause shes so hot. And either way I didnt pay to see it cause I get in for free I work at the movies. Anyways good movie. I didnt know anything about fantastic 4 except that it was a comic book and a cartoon. The only cartoons that I watched when i was litle that were based on superheroes were batman, superman, x-men, and spiderman. Jessica Alba, Maria Menounos, Pascale Hutton, Penelope Corrin, Aonika Laurent, and Morgan Reynolds are hot."
2,"""Not So Fantastic""",This movie didn't really capture my attention. Only the graphic designing kept me from falling asleep during this movie.
2,"Fantastic Four? Yea, more like Fantastic One!","I saw Fantastic Four and noticed that all four of them are not so fantastic. As a matter of fact, the only one I thought was fantastic was Jessica Alba! She is so incredibly gorgeous, I loved her in this movie. I haven't seen anyone as beautiful as her for a long time--wait never mind, I have never seen someone as beautiful as her. She's amazing in this movie, and thank goodness for her. She really did stop this movie from going in the garbage bin! Another save from the beautiful Alba!"
2,A Cinematic Abomination,"My favorite thing about this movie are the new commercials for the dvd, if you listen carefully you can hear a character distinctly yell, ""don't even think about it!"" Good advice. My desire to see movies decreased after viweing this trash, don't say you weren't warned. The second star is for Jessica Alba. Look elsewhere for fun of any sort. I wouldn't be surprised if this is the last we hear from this fantastic four. Thank the heavens if that is the case."
2,Doesnt count,"I'm gonna say that this one doesn't count and the next time they make a F4 movie, it better be well thought out and more like the comics. There was some really dark stuff in the comics and they were generally fairly serious unless Spiderman or some other New York City hero was involved.Some reviewers have stated that what makes the movie a good choice among superhero movies is that the team all have issues with one another and this dynamic helps to overshadow the poorer aspects of the film. I disagree; I dont think the conflicts within the group were well conceived at all. Look at both X-Men movies. Now there is some well thought out conflict among that group. But everything in this movie just seemed childish and immature, not at all what I would expect from a Marvel film, and certainly not one about the Fantastic 4."
1,AWFUL!,"I hope i never have the misfortune of seeing such a debauchery of film again, how can you even call this a film?! If I ever have to watch something like that again, im liable to gouge my eyes out. The onlt thing that you can give this movie is that Jessica Alba is frickin gorgeous!!! But othe than that, this movie should die! Fantastic four ranks right up there with films such as lost in translation for the all time worst movie ive ever seen and now i think i'll go kill myself just because i saw it. Anyone who says this movie is remotely good, is an idiot with no grip on reality, this movie sucked!!!!!!"
2,Perhaps a More Fantastic Sequel?,"Doctor Doom starting out as an unscrupulous corporate head?!!!Forsooth!Other than the principle characters, there was none of the inspiration and innovation of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby present in this mostly by the numbers superhero flick. Let's hope the sequel, featuring the Silver Surfer, will be an improvement."
3,Was not as Fantastic as I had hoped,"I love superhero movies. I thought X-men 2, Spiderman 1 & 2 and Batman Begins were really well done. This movie is sort of like the first X-men . . . highly anticipated and hiped up and a little bit of a let down. I mean they put the ca bash on the Roger Corman movie back in the 1990's and made us wait all these years for this film . . . I am not sure it was worth the wait. I think the one thing that really disappointed me is that I really didn't feel any emotion from the actors . . . somehow it left me cold. The only exception was Chris Evans . . . He is perfect as the human flame . . . but the rest of the acting was like sitcom quality . . . maybe that is because they used several TV actors. I have seen a bootleg of the Roger Corman movie and although the special effects are pathetic the acting had a lot more heart. Maybe the sequel will be better . . . if there is one."
5,Fun entertainment,"Fun escapism in the realm of Marvel's most recognizable superhero team!Far more entertaining than the Elecktra, Daredevil, and Incredible Hulk debacles ( the Bill Bixby TV Hulk in a league of it's own and not to mix in with the CGI loser Hulk movie from Ang Lee )"
3,Most Extras Missing from Blu-Ray,"If you're considering the Blu-ray version, you should know that most of the special features from the DVD version are missing from the Blu-ray. Only the audio commentary and a handful of movie trailers remain.The hi-def picture and sound are very good.I won't tell you what I thought of the movie itself. There are plenty of other reviewers to do that."
4,Way better than I expected!,My son wanted this for Christmas. I am not really into *super heros* but watched it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised! Its funny and entertaining. Has your typical good guys and bad guys and dont forget a love story. I recently saw where a sequel to this will be out in theaters this summer. We will be going!
4,Cool sequel,"This is a decent sequel to the first film. Yes, the film does not follow canon exactly, but it is still a film worth checking out. Special effects are also cool, and the plotline is coherent. I know some people don't like this and from what I see the reactions are mixed, but as long as you set aside expectations that this is going to be exactly like the comics, I think you will enjoy it."
4,Great Edition,This Double Format Edition of F4 is a great buy. It has both Widescreen and Full Screen Versions of the film With commentary. However the featurettes are no longer included.
4,Extras,"This is a great movie and it looks wonderful. However, I do want to let people know that this movie does not have any extras. One review that I was reading about this version said that this edition had the extra scenes that I had seen on tv. It does not have any extra scenes. For the price however, it is a good purchase. I was just disappointed that it didn't have the additional scenes that I was led to believe it had."
4,Good for a Comic Movie,"Fantastic Four was a fun movie. I wasn't really familiar with the stories of anything like that except for the Wii game Marvel Superheroes. The movie has fun story and shows that being true to yourself is always the best policy. The characters, as far as I can tell, are true to the comics and are acted pretty well for a comic book movie. The special effects are pretty good in the movie. The look believable and flow with the film.I would recommend this movie if you have enjoyed X-Men, Spider-Man, or other comic inspired films."
5,I just plain LOVE this movie!,"I didn't grow up on comic books or stories... but I am really getting into the superhero movies that keep coming out. I really enjoy this movie because of the variety of characters. Of course, the addition of great actors is a bonus - especially the super-sexy Julian McMahon.Keep in mind, when you watch sci-fi, you have to suspend your disbelief and just go with the flow. Those who want to sit and question the science or analyze the movie aren't going to enjoy it. Enjoy it for the action, the people, the actors, and the basic storyline. Grab a bowl of popcorn and enjoy the ride!A good addition to your DVD collection!"
3,"Not. bad. Not great, . . . but not bad.","I remember when the ""Fantastic Four"" comic books first appeared in the early `60s and how I enjoyed the breath of fresh air they brought to the genre. Basing a live-action film on a comic book is something else, though, and the attempt is often winceingly unsuccessful. (The ""X-Men"" movie was pretty bad, in my view.) This one isn't too bad, mostly because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Ioan Gruffiudd is pretty good as the nerdy Reed Richards and Jessica Alba is okay as Sue Storm. The show is stolen by the other two members of the team, though -- Chris Evans as the smart-mouthed, narcissistic Johnny Storm, and Michael Chiklis as the anguished Ben Grimm, ""The Thing."" On many levels, of course, it's just another cliched superhero movie, but the writers didn't forgo plot and character development in favor of mindless ""action."""
3,Fantastic Four worth Three Stars,"The bar for comic book movies has been set pretty high with the success and quality of films such as the Batman and Spiderman series; not to mention Superman. The greaat thing about this movie is that the Fantastic Four gets the star treatment here rather than some B movie that does not do the comic series justice. Admittedly, I was only a casual F4 fna as a kid. This movie was very entertaining and is never dull. The actors are compelling and the story is decent. There are some fun scenes with nifty special effects. A couple of cool scenes include a time where the team comes together in a fight with Doctor Doom and they all use their powers collectively, and a scene where the Thing and Doctor Doom fight at the bottom of a pool. Enjoy this movie for what it is... a solid three star fun flick that looks great on DVD."
5,Great Picture Quality and Sound Makes a Good Movie Even Better!,"I'm not going to remark on my opinion of the story, actors or direction of the film because you can read that kind of stuff on a movie review site.What I will tell you is that the Blu-ray version rocks! The picture is great - so clear you feel like you are right there and the sound is clean, defined, and will shake the foundation of your house on the exciting parts if you crank it up.Don't even bother with the DVD version, you'll feel like your watching the flick with blur goggles on. Go with Blu-ray and experience the movie the way it was meant to be seen!"
4,Great fun,"Fantastic four actually delivers what it promises- a film which is based on a comic book. So if you put aside the negative reviews and watch it in a light and ""popcorn"" mood you will actually enjoy it.The film is about a team that goes into space to study a unique phenomenon which, in turn, alters their dna and they get special powers. And the Fantastic Four are born. Jessica Alba is gorgeous but Flame and Thing/Rock really spice the film up.The film is not really true to the comic book but it does not really matter as it is entertaining provided that you watch it in a relaxed mood. There are some flows and the romance outcome is predictable but you will enjoy it.Moreover it sets it self up for more sequels and hopefully they will be as good.The blu-ray version is excellent and the special effects come out in a stunning form. The picture is as sharp as it can be and makes the film even more enjoyable."
3,"Man, this missed the Fantastic Mark!!","When I saw this in the big movie house, I easily got bored after awhile. My wife thought the same, so it wasn't just me.Decent enough special effects, I suppose. But without great writing and acting performances, this easily becomes Marvel's weakest movie to date. (Even Electra was better than this.)Insofar as plot and acting and writing is concerned. I certainly hope they do it bigger and better the 2nd time around."
1,You will not be disappointed,this movie does not exceed expectations. It only proves not every comic makes a good movie.
4,What's not to like?,"From a fan of the comic book, the 'Fantastic Four' movie delivers. It quickly introduces the characters and explains the origin of their powers as well as introducing the best comic book villain ever and ends with a climatic fight scene. The special effects are good especially concerning Dr. Richards' elasticity. Yeah, the movie's appeal is only superficial, but I have no complaints."
2,Good special effects but to much profinaty,"Let me open up to say that this film had alot of cursingincluding a use of the lords name in vane. Okay the special effects where good, but it did not save this movie.Rated PG-13 for action violence strong languge and some suggestive content"
2,Disapointing,"For me If there's one word that can sum up this movie that word would be WAITING. Waiting for nothing. This movie is about four people who hate each other who go up into space, gain special powers, spend 99.9% of the movie arguing about how to return to there normal state. I thought I was watchin a soap Opera. Some parts are funny, but in a corny kiddie way. At the end they come togeather for the last 2 min. of the movie and spray the villan with a fire hydrant. THE END. Thats it. Thats all there is to it.No action, just disfunctional relationships. If there is one thing that really made me angry its ""the thing"". He spends the whole movie crying because he has super powers and when he gets the chance to go back to being a human he decides he'd much rather stay this way. Whatever. I gave this movie 2 stars for Speacial Effects and Jessica Alba."
3,"Get the exclusive, limited edition 3 disc set at Best Buy","If you're thinking of buying this then hurry to Best Buy as they have an exclusive 3 disc version that contains the film on DVD, cd-rom with the first 23 issues of the comic, annual of the Ultimate Fantastic 4 comic, Ultimate Fantastic 4 issue 12 comic, 8 collectible round trading cards, a metal tin and stand.I went today and they only had several left so it is quite limited unlike most DVDs that are called 'limited edition' but aren't really. On the other hand nothing will ever be as limited as the Xbox360 right now and if it fails to sell in future, Microsoft will deserve it.Also having the comics and extras will make up for all those liberties the studio took in not sticking to the comic origins of the Fantastic 4."
4,Did we all see the same movie???,"I've been reading a lot of reviews of this movie (from pros & average joes), and a lot of people are crapping on it....I really don't get it.Going in to see this movie I was expecting the worst...like Batman & Robin bad....however I was pleasantly surprised. It's not Spider-man 2 great, but it is on par with the first X-men (i.e. movie could have been longer and the ending ""bigger"", but the potential for a superior sequel is there)FF is definitely more lighter & comedic than other super-hero movies...and it should be. The FF has never been dark & brooding...it's always been about a slightly disfunctional family with super-powers.The one issue I had with this film was the editing...the transistion from some scenes seems very choppy...i get the sense that a lot was left on the cutting room floor to quicken the pace of the movie. Hopefully, a extended cut DVD version will be offered with those scenes placed back and the movie should flow better."
4,Good Movie,This Dvd came very fast in the mail.. within a couple of days I had it. It is a pretty good movie to own too.Thanks so much!
3,Fantastic 4 -- Not So Fantastic,"Unhappily, the film fell far short of even my limited expectations. Having grown up reading the comic book series, I do not recall a single story that was ""campy."" Besides not taking itself seriously, the film was thin on tension. The treatment of Dr. Doom was a travesty. The actors did the best they could with what they were given, but they could not pull this turkey out of the trenches. Anyone planning a re-boot MUST go back and study the original series drawn by Jack Kirby to gain any kind of appropriate scope for The Fantastic 4. This was one of Marvel's best-selling titles. It deserves much better treatment and respect than provided by this half-baked effort."
2,The Economic Review,"Normally, I like to spot off ad naseum. For this one, I'll keep it short. To toss this out there, I'm a fan of comics. The Thing is one of my favorite Marvel characters. Now the review-lite:Michael Chiklas (please forgive my poor spelling) is great as the Thing. He emotes well through the suit, and fits the Ben Grimm role quite well. Ioan Gruffudd is OK as Mr. Fantastic, but could have done more with it. Jessica Alba is a waste of space as Sue (albeit a nice looking one), and Chris Evans got annoying as Torch. Victor von Doom wasn't portrayed with any real gravity, either. Jokes were lame, but a decent attempt to portray the four as a family with their share of rows.Not a terrible movie, mind you, but not worth watching more than once. A rental at best. Here's hoping the inevitable sequel is better..."
3,Not the best I've seen,"When it comes from Marvel Comics, I know that this movie is a must see in my part. In the end, I was a little disappointed because the storyline was kind of weak and the acting mediocre. Although, what I've learned in film school is if the writing of the movie's bad, it can make the actors look second-rate. I've seen Jessica Alba perform much better in other movies and TV. Even though I didn't think all that highly of the movie, I am looking forward watching the sequel, ""Fantastic Four: Rise of The Silver Surfer"" which comes out in June of 2007. :)"
3,Fantastic 4 - somewhat fantastic... Somewhat not...,"Some of the extras on this disc, such as the Jessic Alba home movies taken during the promotional push for the film was interesting to watch once, but I was really hoping to get more featurettes on the origins with the comic book and the Marvel crew/animators (similar to what they did with the extras on the Spiderman DVD). There is a whole history to the characters there that gets mentioned very, very briefly by Stan Lee, but they never really explore that history in the extras, which seems a shame. Still, if you liked the movie, you'll enjoy the DVD."
5,Awesome Movie,"This is a great action movie, with a limited amount of violence, and therefore I would recomend it as a movie for ages 10 and up, but it is fun to watch for all ages, I am 20 and I loved it and I would recomend it to any of my friends."
1,I didn't get to watch it.,"Would've been nice to know that iPad to TV HDMI Output is not supported BEFORE I bought the movie. Thanks, Amazon."
4,Fantastic!!!,"The Fantastic Four is truly fantistic. And as an avid comic book collector, it was very entertaining. Not once did I tell myself ""that didn't happen in the comic"". The first time I saw this movie was a rental, liked it so much I bought it."
3,Not what I expected,"When I got this, I expected it to come in its own DVD case. Instead it was a thin case, like what you get for a TV Show series. I will keep the movie but thought future costumers would like to know that it doesn't come in a normal sized case, if they are trying to finish a collection like I was."
2,Wasted opportunity,"This film is a missed chance really. It could have been a cool production like the new Spiderman movies, but it ended up being a movie that cannot decide between comic and real drama. In addition to that there are some very strange facts. A beautiful blonde being a brilliant doctor..a reckless kid being an official space pilot...Sue being Doom's girlfriend with no passion of whatsoever on the surface..Dr.Doom is not nearly as impressive as the one from the Marvel cartoons. The special effects however are okay.(SARR)"
3,Buen titulo,"En realidad compre este titulo para mi pequeña hija, pero me gusto mucho este disco BluRay ya que usando un buen Reproductor y una buena pantalla LCD los efectos se veian muy bien. Ademas cabe señalar que aparecen algunas escenas que no aparecen en el DVD convencional."
2,A silly comic flick,"Nothing in the story was particularly interesting or even held together. As you can expect from a high budget US movie, the special effects were good. The acting was nothing much."
4,(:D) ....ok,"i thought it was good..a good second attempt in making the movie again, great cast and a good movie...hope they have a sequel...."
2,You Must Be Joking Right?,Okay this movie is not all bad but it's not all that good and after seeing a better comic book movie like Hellboy I began to see how weak this movie was. I mean it's just sooo cheap even The Thing's rocky skin looks fake but anyway not going to spend alot of time talking about this flop of movie all I can say is don't bother buying it. Two stars at best.
1,Piece of crap,This re-make of the Fantastic 4 brings the origional to shame. Sure the grafics are good but the story lines totally kills the cartoon series.
1,Pure Junk!!!,"What a pointless, bad written, acted, directed movie. I guess I didn't expect much, but it was beyond bad. there is really not much else to say. Don't bother watching this junk."
2,What Happen,"This year we had some great movies based on comics. Constatine was pretty good, Sin City was better than I expected and Batman Begins was great. So when Fantasic Four came out I couldn't wait to see it.But at the end of the film I couldn't believe what I saw. This was not the movie I saw in the previwes. All it is about is them trying to go back being normal The Thing finally goes back to being human but just changes back and all he was doing was bitch and moan. But when their fighting Dr. Doom that was a pretty good part of the movie but the only good part. This is worser than the Hulk. If they make a sequal find a better director."
4,"great music, great hearts, great spirits!","I've seen these guys in concert. they are absolutely awesome. they will no doubt be nationally famous very soon. They are on Take Hold records which will also be famous soon. they are a great hardcore band and they are awesome guys. they put on a great show, are really entertaining and their music is of highest quality. they are also very spiritual, influencing people for Christ and inviting them into a relationship with him. they simply rock! get their cd, you won't be dissapointed."
3,It's alright,Act of depression.I thought would of been aloft better musically.I men yes love sure pure and watch me die are brutal.but some of these songs was like the same riff for a long time it's like building up then the same thing.the vocals are awsome.could of been better cries of the past is better. some parts are good.but some sings are not good all the way though.it's like the whole song should be good all the way though.
4,some greedy people on here...,"I can't believe these people on here are trying to get over $100 out of this one CD. Don't get me wrong, I thought it was a good album but I'm sorry, that is just robbery to ask that much. 40-50 maybe only cause it's rare. But you people should be ashamed asking that ungodly amount. I own this album and would be happy to share it.(if it wasn't illegal) Ok, the album is before the band went more mainstream. Still Dallas behind vocals. The screaming is brutal and much more christian based compared to their latest works. Not for everyone but if you like Underoath it is a must have...just don't pay what these people are asking."
5,Metalcore At Its Finest,"An extraordinarily talented debut album. Dallas's voice is phenomenal and outperforms the new singer Spencer. Highly influential Christian lyrics with astounding guitar riffs & drum leads. A must have for any Underoath/Metalcore fan. I first downloaded this album about 4 years ago, and had difficulty locating the album. I observed that the price here is astonishing lofty. I was able to acquire a new print from Barnes & Noble at $23.00 a few months back..."
3,linda hayes comment,"for the record, the beautiful linda hayes is the mother of cathy lee crosby, and appeared thru the 40's in b-pics. roy was also lucky in having elyse knox (the mother of mark harmon) in another of his pics, in the ""pre-dale"" era. elyse much more well-known, even in few serials.."
1,Alpha Video DVD picture quality is terrible,You can always count on Alpha Video to be totally inconsistent when it comes to the quality of their DVDs; some are beautiful and crystal clear... others are terrible. Romance on the Range is definitely terrible video quality. The picture is so bad it looks like it was mastered from a second generation VHS tape. I can't believe Alpha would put out such an inferior product. Don't waste your money!
5,Fantastic!!!,"I watched this series of tapes as a samll child and loved it. It does so much for children and their desire to read. I just purchased it for my niece and she loves it just as much as I did, if not more! This is an EXCELLENT series! I would recommend it to all parents and elementary school teachers."
1,lasted 2 minutes,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present. We put in the batteries, she drove into the kitchen over the tiny floor divider. That was it. It broke. It may have been a fun toy. We will never know."
5,Rubinstein-Heifetz-Feuermann,"Artist-for-artist a better trio is not possible. When it comes to violin music, if Jascha has recorded it, I don't bother to see who else has."
4,bible songs,Many of these songs are the ones used at our Church of Christ bible classes so it is great as I don't know all the words.
4,Granddaughter loves them,Granddaughter loves them.When I play the cd she really seems to enjoy them and she is just turning 20 months. She does dance to the songs too.
4,Keep Your Mouth Closed Dear,"This is a funny story about a little alligator who just can't keep his mouth closed. He swallows many things, and his parents try and try to teach him to ""Keep your mouth closed, dear!"". This book was a favorite of my daughter when she was young and I would dearly love to purchase it now for my niece and nephews. I hope the printers will consider another printing of this delightful children's book."
5,"A great book, sorry it's out of print","Keep Your Mouth Closed Dear is the story of a small alligator who swallows all manner of things, including mom's wooden spoon, soap and other things - and the lenghts his parents go to trying to keep him from doing so. In the end, all is well - it's a great story. I loved it as a child and my children do to. Sorry to see I can't order it....perhaps it will be reprinted."
2,Not for the casual scientist/sci fi reader,"Asimov's collection of essays reprinted from various publications touches on topics such as chemistry, physics, electronics and astronomy as well as the philosophy of humanity's usage and development of these sciences. I have to admit that I didn't read them all in their entirety, but rather started them and read until I got bored or my head hurt to much. I am not personally well-versed in any of these areas, and so learned quite a bit. However, the information is rather dated especially in electronics and other technology. This is mostly a collection for the die-hard fan of Asimov, or some of his more scientifically educated fans. I'm pretty sure I thought it was science fiction when I picked it up, probably without even reading the back."
5,Great Book,"I've never been one to play those games at carnivals and fairs. This book caught my eye as something interesting and after reading all the reviews I wanted to know more. This book provides many hints and tips on how to win these types of games. It does not provide any illegal information or any method of cheating. Instead the author has practiced and practiced and figured out the tricks- the reason the carny can do it and you can't. He provides lists of the best games to play, the worst games to play, and a test to figure out your vision dominant eye. If you are ever tempted to play these types of games it is worth reviewing this book before going."
2,"Practice makes perfect, not this book...","This is the 3rd book that I've read on this subject. The author gives a method (that he uses) to win each game. I would like to point out that the ""carnies"" make their living from people who walk up to their games thinking they can win those big stuffed animals. The odds are strongly in their favor. The best method that I've seen, is to build your own version of the game and practice until you can get it right. And this book can't help you with that. I will say that the price of this book is the least expensive of the 3 that I now own. Sorry for the pessimism but that's just my 2 cents. :-)"
3,"Fun, but poorly written","Richardson gives genuine insights & background to common midway games, but the writing is about junior high school level.Example from Chapter 4: ""As I was coming to the table, I noticed a guy walking away briskly. Obviously this individual didn't have that much common sense for as I looked down in his former ball hopper...I saw two balls."" Why was it obvious that the guy didn't have that much common sense?Another example: At the end of the book, Richardson rates the top 10 roller coasters in America ""in descending order."" I know this may be nitpicking, but the list goes from #10 to #1, which is AScending order.The book is very small (only 4"" x 7"") with lots of blank space on the pages, but for [little money] I guess you can't expect too much."
2,I personally did not like this book....,"because he tells the readers what the games are than to tell us what the secrets are. After reading the whole book, I felt like I didn't learn anything new. Sometimes I feel as if the author writes too much ""un-necessary"" stuff...Perhaps if pictures were added to the book, the instructions could be more clear... and the stuff that the author says it's not that funny!"
3,Ink spills out of the cartridge,"I love the green color but something's not right. After a few days, the ink leaks out of the cartridge and into the cap and/or barrel of the pen. There were no instructions with the cartridges so I don't know if I'm inserting them right or wrong. I've been using Lamy refills for a while with other fountain pens, so perhaps it's fluke or my pen. I just don't know."
4,Stainless Steel Siding Nails do the job!,These Stainless Steel Siding Nails are strong and durable. They don't come loose because of the ribbed shanks holding power.
1,"PC users, BEWARE !!!!!!!!","I had spent many days looking for a controller for my computer. I carefully searched many others, but this one seemed best. I read all reviews, then I ordered it. When I arrived, I was so excited, I nearly fainted. About 3 hours later I had REGRETTED buying it. I tried using it to play games on my computer such as, Max payne 2 and Hitman 2. I tested the controller and it was fine but however, THE GAMES DIDN'T EVEN DETECT IT. I spent so much time trying to figure out how to get to play the games with the controller. Out of 5 games I had, only 2 were able to detect the controller. I would've given it 2 stars but,I contacted the seller for help, and they did not respond.All of this turbo, mapping, and false programming was just frustrating me.I don't have a PS2. Now, based on the other reviews, you should get this controller only to use with a PS2. DO NOT buy it for your PC."
1,Not a good way to prepare for the SAT!,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. I have been getting ready for the SAT and I was hoping to find some good tips--without having to take a course. Well, I went to the wrong place. I bought two books, the Princeton Review 'cracking the SAT' book and the Kaplan book, thinking they were the best in the business, and I was only right about one of them. The Kaplan book was filled with silly ideas that just didn't work.. . and it wasn't for a lack of trying. I worked with the book almost religiously for about a month, and my scores went DOWN! The techniques were silly and confusing. In fact, their ideas about how to do the math section were totally messed up. As far as the verbal section went, the only section I managed to not go down on was the critical reading section, and that's because I pretty much ignored it and did it my own way. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!"
3,Good for Circuit Training,"I bought this CD with the intentions for my step class but was disappointed. It starts with a 138bpm for track 1 as the warm up and tracks 2&3 increase to 140bpm but then tracks 4-10 decrease to 121-127 bpm. Then tracks 12-16 finally speed up to 130-138 bpm. Unless you have pitch control to slow/speed up the music, it's not that great for advanced stepping. I'd use this CD more for my circuit training/body conditioning classes instead. Overall the music is great and gets you pumped, the tempo fluctuations sucked tho'."
3,This thing is huge,"I assumed this was a standard size for a homeowner. It's not. It's for a contractor. They also don't tell you can't return it because it states on the thing that it contains ""highly flammable"" chemicals. So if you got it you keep it. It is standard deck glue and thus strong. It'll take me forever to use it but it will probably harden before that."
3,neat,"When I first saw this game I thought it was great, it was a little dissapointing. The moving was slow and the cd switching was a little anoying. It had great graphics and a great storyline. The puzzles are hard, I had to look at cheats. It is a neat game but it has it's drawbacks."
3,A so-so game,"I should start off by saying that I adored Myst and generallyliked Riven. My family and I have made a group pastime of solvingadventure games like these, and found this one to be only mediocre. I think this game had a lot of potential but was released entirely too early. The graphics are alright but your exploration of the surroundings are extremely restricted. The puzzles are also pretty decent; some are easily solved by intuition, some are pleasantly challenging but some are flawed--either convoluted or buggy. Overall, if you crave good adventure/mystery games like Myst, this is a good buy. It is worth the money, just don't expect a masterpiece. Some other games worth checking out are Beyond Time and Lighthouse. END"
1,Lightbringer Review,"I must say, when I played this game I was very dissapointed. I found it overpriced for such a poor game. The graphics were pretty good (though not the best i've seen), but it was dark and hard too make out certain areas. It relly annoyed me as you can only move certain ways at times. I found the puzzles a little too difficult, tireing, and I think they took way too long for one section of the game. Overall, I think the idea is of the game is appealing, but the overall game could defenatly be better."
1,Gameplay is not open enough,"I was first attracted to Lightbringer by the storyline, in which you explore the famous ""artificial"" structures located in the Cydonia region of Mars. However, after playing, I found that ""explore"" was a bit of a stretch. You have a very limited range of movement, travelling only in one or two directions that the game will allow. The graphics are nice, but they get repetitive, and are also a bit too dark to make out detail. This inability to see detail will lead to problems in some of the puzzles. I also had to use a walkthrough to play, as most puzzles have no real explanation of their prupose or the goal. Without a walkthrough, it seems the only way to get through most of the game's puzzles would be random clicking until the puzzle is solved."
4,Pretty good for Dream Catcher,"I own several of the Dream Catcher games and this one is by far one of the best. The rating is more 31/2 than a four, however I enjoyed the graphics and the story line. The puzzles were challenging but not to hard. Further, the game wasn't hampered by continual technical problem like some of Dream Catcher's products. The game was boring in places, and the game could have used more dialogue. Over all, I thought it was worth the investment."
3,"Starts out great, but...","The beginning is great with fast paced action, beautiful girls, and lots of buttkicking. But after about half an hour it suddenly starts to drag on. The romance is totally misplaced, the characters are dull, and the plot is completely undeveloped. I couldn't wait for the movie to end."
5,Very Good Movie,"This movie is really good. Besides the three actresses, it is certainly not one of those ""cliche"" like action movies. This film invokes a feeling that is quite different than most films I have seen similar to this kind of nature. The martial arts choreography is very good but with an additional sort of intuitive intelligence. The three main characters are very intuitive as if they operate on a much more complex level than so appears on the surface. And yes, the women are wonderful."
5,Love it!,"This movie has got some pretty, stunning asian girls. Charlie's Angel is nothing compared to this movie. The girls in Charlie's Angel can not even fight as smooth as these three asian girls. These girls fight like they've been doing it for a long time and they are so much sexier."
5,PHAT- PRETTY HOT AND TEMPTING..,THESE GIRLS WERE GREAT ACTRESSES. THEY MADE IT SEEM AMAZING. IT ALSO KEPT ME OFF MY FEET AND WANTING TO SEE MORE.
4,"SO CLOSE, SO GOOD","This movie is so good on so many levels. It has action, drama, a great script and fairly decent acting. It doesn't hurt that three females in the movie are hotties. I recommend buying this DVD as you will want to see it again and again. Hollywood: look here for a good movie."
3,The Cutest bunch of grown women ever!,"A good cute movie, meaning this isn't one of those major serious movies, but it was serious enough for me to own it... The Asian babes in it are all babes... Like dolls we men could play with, ya feel me? My gripe about the movie is a slight bit of lesbo action towards the end and some foul language... Why can't a movie be all the way clean for once? Oh because Hollywood is filth, no wonder! Gorgeous babes though... Classic Asian babes"
4,So close,"The title hits it pretty close to the mark on this one; so close. Cute, fun smart, sexy, tragic, action. Not the best film ever but certainly worth owning."
5,Excellent book for classrooms,I have added this book to my classroom library for 5th graders. They enjoy reading books about diverse people. Ben Carson is our classroom hero!
4,"Exelent story, and very good illistrations!!","Great autobiography I think the author could have given a little more efort into this book but as the book itself says he works a brain surgion all his life. He almost hit his mom and almost stabed his friend. Read more in this book about his temper and much much more. GREAT BOOK BEN I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ""Brian Gaughan"""
2,Predictable,"The acting, if you can call it that, was poor from most of the main characters. The story was predictable but with a weak ending. Just couldn't get into this movie and will sell it at my next yard sale!"
5,MOVIE ON HALLMARK,THIS WAS VERY ROMANTIC AND FUNNY AT THE SAME TIME. I ENJOYED THIS DVD VERY MUCH; BECAUSE I AM AROMANTIC AT HEART.
4,Very Sweet Movie. . .,I enjoyed this movie. It's innocent and innocuous and cute--perfect for a rainy afternoon when you just wanna laze around and not think. It's predictable and has a happy ending. BUT watch out. . this is the same movie as A Valentine's Date so don't be fooled. I think sometimes moviemakers do this to trick the consumer into spending more money.
2,Disappointed,"Before buying this album, I had not heard of Old Blind Dogs, although I enjoy Celtic (mostly Irish) music a great deal. I purchased the album on the strength of the other customer reviews. After listening to the album several times, I can only say that it is uninspiring. The singing is flat, without character. Same for the music. The CD case, on the other hand, is very attractive. Anyway, it's not bad, just unremarkable. I would never go out of my way to listen to these guys. Contrast this album with a much better album by Seamus Tansey called ""Easter Snow."""
5,Old Blind Dogs rock!,"We saw/heard this group (Old Blind Dogs) at the Lowell (Mass) Folk Festival some years ago. We remembered that they were great and full of energy. We especially liked ""Edward."" This album has great cuts - almost every one of them. Ever buy an album with a cut you loved only to find that the others were just filler? Not so with this album. You'll love it."
2,for children under 12,this book seems to target children under 12 years of age. It has very few pointers for adolescents. this book tends to be aimed at the education profession rather than parents.
1,"Great movies, lame double-dipping by the studio","I refuse to buy any LOTR Blu-Ray set that does not have both the theatrical and extended versions. Part of the whole selling point for BluRay is the huge amount of data that it can have. If they could do branching versions of the same movie on standard DVD (as with some of James Cameron's films), they sure as hell can do it with Blu-Ray. I really prefer only the extended version of Two Towers, but I just have to balk at this kind of insulting attempt at bilking the fans."
1,Rip Off,I am waiting and waiting for the true extended version... this is unfortunate that the studio chose to not release both...do not buy in protest!
1,Gouging the Consumer Again!,"Ridiculous. They're trying to gouge the consumer again just like they did with the DVDs. Blu-ray's technology makes it dirt simple to incorporate the theatrical and extended editions both in the same release with a title menu option. The studio choose to ignore and anger their customers by trying to sell the same movie to us twice to make a few extra bucks. Shameful display, and no excuse for it.Fantastic movies, but I'll wait for the Extended Editions thank you very much."
1,Wait for the extended edition!,"The title of my review says it all...""Wait for the extended version."" While I won't criticize them for trying to make as much money as they can--it is well within their right, I think it is a bit silly to release a theatrical version first and an extended version two years later--especially since both are already available on DVD.Release both at the same time, and let the consumer decide which one he or she would like to purchase. I personally will wait the two-years and get the extended edition."
1,STOP! DONT PREORDER/BUY!!,"Joining the boycott of this ridiculousness!!! There is absolutely no reason that they would not release the extended versions except for attempting to dupe people into buying them twice ... AGAIN! Release them both at the same time and let people decide if they want to save a few buck and get the far less superior theatrical versions. I've waited this long for them on blu-ray, guess another year won't hurt. I'm advising everyone else to do the same."
1,Only the theatrical version NOT Extended - Stay Away RIPOFF,"Was going to order it - then saw it was only the theatrical version NOT EXTENDEDThey will sell this copy, milk as much money as they can out of it, THEN sell the extended version on blu-ray. SKIP IT."
1,Great movie - Moneygrab BR version (Theatrical),"Like other people/reviewers, I think this LOTR moneygrab (like George Lucas' Wars never-ending updates) has gone on far enough.If they do not want to release multiple versions in the same package, fair enough. But they should make the Extended Versions available at the same time as the Theatrical Version and not force (or to be precise, induce) fans of the movies to doubledip on first the theatrical versions and then the extended. If both versions are available at the same time, people can decide for themselves which version they want.Like other people, let me insert the link for the extended version here so that people can sign up for that and hopefully, by sheer strength of numbers, maybe we can get the message across:The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Editions) [Blu-ray]"
1,Another 1 star vote to make sure no one buys this.,"Money-hungry is a nice way of describing this tactic. First get all the suckers to shell out $80, then hit them again later with what they really wanted in the first place. Don't fall for it. As a fan of the books, I pretty much hated the theatrical version of all the films compared to the extended version (which had its problems as well).On the topic, answer me this - The Hobbit, a prequel, gets two movies, but each of the books in the trilogy only gets one. Where the foresight? My hopes for The Hobbit being decent are in the hole already so I won't be disappointed as I was back in 2001, 2002 and 2003. Peter, seriously, leave it alone!"
1,Give me a break!,This is a bunch of crap. Release these movies properly. Do the right thing and cancel this crap and do it right!
1,This is completely asinine...,"Thanks New Line. Thanks for trying to milk us again. It'd be nice if there was some sort of tradeup program, or if they weren't trying to milk us on these purchases, which they clearly are by a) the price of this set, and b) the fact that the extended versions are NOT INCLUDED. I will NOT be buying this set and will instead be finding some other means of obtaining and watching these films in HD. When you decide to announce the release of the extended editions, I may buy them depending on my mood. Right now I'd say yes, but who knows. This is one customer that you will NOT be milking dry. I suggest everybody else do the same."
1,How GREEDY one can be!,"I agree with all other reviewers. Good People, PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BLURAY, unless you do not care about the extended versions of these films! The distributors did it to us all back when they first released these on plain old DVD...remember? First came the ""Theatrical Version"". Second came the ""Extended Version"". Third came the ""Boxed Set Version"". Fourth came the ""Special Extended DVD Edition"" in which each movie came with two additional DVD's (part 1 thru part 6) titled ""The Appendices"". Whew...well those are the ones I know about. All I can say is that I will NOT be played again. I will wait patiently for the extended version on Bluray, afterall, I do have it on DVD."
1,Shameless,"Peter Jackson is shamelessly greedy and argent if he expects consumers to double or quadruple dip at these price points. I already own the 4 disc extended DVD editions - arguably three of the best definitive DVD movie releases ever. Those picture transfers were excellent so I don't feel the need to upgrade. However, if I were, I'd hold out for the extended versions."
1,Just wait for it...,"Everyone knows how great the movies are...this pre-review is for the sham or releasing the theatrical version instead of the full one in hopes that people will buy both.I really hope people boycott this release and force New Line's hand to put out the extended version a.s.a.p.I loved all 3 movies in the theater but once you have seen the extended version,why would you want to watch the original one.I don't think that it will be much difference in price or number of discs.Funny but the selling point of Bluray over HD DVD was it was supposed to be able to handle more content on each disc but that's not really working out that way."
1,"No extended edition, no money from me",This is NOT the definitive edition of the film. Wait until 2011 to buy the extended editions.
1,Money Grab,"This is just another attempt by these media companies to fleece the very fans that support their business,"
1,What a rip-off!,I really hope not a single person on this planet will buy this version (but they will and that's what makes this so annoying).New Line should be ashamed.. So just to annoy them I'll download this version and buy the extended..
1,Deserves the bad publicity,Overt rip-off of consumers. They are doing the same with Avatar. Extended version of both of these films to be released later.Hold on to your wallets.
1,LET ME SEE IF I LOOK AS STUPID AS YOU THINK I AM!,"I LOVE this Trilogy and think it's possibly one of the best films ever made, HOWEVER, I will not be exploited and teased with the ""almost"" complete deal. NO WAY am I going to purchase this till they come out with the extended releases as they should have done in the first place. THAT's WHY WE GOT BLU-RAY!!!!!"
2,"Doo Doo, (only a baby thinks that's profiane)","Stinx. Why all the re-relesases and re=harsh hashes of films that were diluted to begin with? I bought the biggest and the best in '01-03 but PU-LEEZ most of us are wise to the way of the company avatar bouot now. git over it. OOh and make the one where Frodo becomes deformed like Golumn, then you've got my attention.see yaa!"
1,An adventure in fantasy film disaster...,"Goblins? Fairies? Ogres? Elijah Wood?People actually like this film?Get the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy instead.Christopher Lloyd. Michael J. Fox. Now these are REAL actors. The special effects in this trilogy are way better than the ones seen in the ""Lord Of the Rings""."
5,Theatrical versions only won 17 Academy Awards...that's all.,"I am writing this as both a review of the movies themselves and the blu-rays.First and foremost, everyone is complaining that these are not the extended editions. Well the theatrical versions ONLY won 17 academy awards...that's all. They are still amazing movies, and Return of the King was voted best movie of all time on Yahoo.Now for the blu-rays themselves. The movies look great naturally, and the sound is amazing. All the bonus features are great that come in this 9 disc set, including digital copies of each movie which was a nice suprise. Again people complain that this set does not come with the extended editions and I say to them; If you don't like it just don't buy it and wait for the extendeds. Just because all the fanboys are mad doesn't mean they should complain about it on Amazon.I'm just trying to give an honest and unbiased review of this product, disregarding all the fanboys, and the verdict is...5 out of 5, near perfection."
1,It's like good drugs,I want it and new line is the only person that can give it to me. So what am I gonna do? I'm gonna take whatever I can get.
1,blu ray lord of the rings,"you would think that they had already made enough money as it was. the extended version are truly better then the theaterical versions, and nobody in their right mind would shell out that kind of money twice! i hope that the people have learned their leason from the first time, and that nobody buys the theaterical versions."
1,Don't waste your money,Do not buy this . LOTR are one of the best trilogy's out there and these blood suckers want you to pay for the theatrical cut then later pay for the extended cut.. Do yourself a favor wait for the extended cut..
1,Not going to get it...,"Oh, please. I guess I shouldn't be surprised that the studio is trying to make people buy two copies of the trilogy again. I'll happily keep my extended DVDs over these."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"If anyone in the entire world buys the theatrical editions of the lord of the rings...again, I will be surprised and angry. This is a complete waste of time and money. Everyone who has seen the extended versions knows that the theatrical versions are nothing in comparison. This is a waste of your time and money and it is a very presumptuous move by the studio releasing it. Let's make sure they lose money on this release, this is complete BS!"
1,Money Suckers,"This is BS. It should be the exact same release as was on the extended, unless they were going to add even more. No passion in the films, all $$$$$.I won't be buying these movies again, ever. Not after this stunt. And seriously...I have a ps3.....yeah blu is great, but seeing those movies on dvd vs blu isn't going to change my life."
5,"5 Stars for LOTR on Blu Ray, 1 Star for the Lack of Extended Edition","When it comes to LOTR, I would normally jump at the chance to own them on blu ray. BUT....after seeing the extended editions when they were released, I just dont know how I could purchase $90 worth of blu ray that lacks hours of footage. I know it's just New Line trying to make money, but I will just watch the upconverted extended edition dvds until then. PREDICTION: Blu Ray extended release will come out one to two months before The Hobbit release."
2,Point less,This really is kind of pointless to get. If you already own both the Theatrical and Extended Edition DVD's. Sure you get a documentary. There are more documentarys on both the Theatrical and Extended Edition.Don't take me giving this stars 2 as meaning there bad movies. They are not they are very great movies. It's just for this DVD set. If you are someone who has not been able to get either the Theatrical and Extended Edition then I say go for it and buy it. But if you already own them then save your money.
1,waiting for the extended edition,waiting for the extended edition - not going to waste money buying the theatrical release and then have to buy the extended release afterward.
1,Great movie - Quaddip shame,"I echo many of the other reviewers here. As a Blu-ray boxed set, it really should contain BOTH the theatrical and extended versions. If not that, then they should AT LEAST release both versions at the same time. It is a sad, sad money grab to say the least. I have purchased the LOR trilogy twice already, and will not purchase it again until the extended Blu-ray version comes out."
1,Turn these into beverage coasters,"Give us, the movie-lovers, the chance to choose theatrical vs extended, and not at double the price and double the plastic."
1,2 or more years to wait for the proper editions? Screw that,"These are probably the finest movies of my generation, and the extended cuts even moreso. So to screw us over AGAIN, the studios can just suck it. They're saying now that it could be 2 or more years, maybe even 2014 before they release the extended cuts on Blu Ray? They'd better come with a $60 coupon then, or they can just keep both copies. The upscaled version of my extended cuts looks just great."
1,Not again ! ! ! !,"I wont buy this , how many times they want us to buy this movie , everybody knows that they could put the two versions together, this is an insult to our common sense, and don't get me wrong I love the LOTR movies, but this kind of marketing needs to stop, this is in another words a rip-off. When they release a truly Blu-Ray Trilogy I'll be the first on line to buy it , for now I keep my dvd's"
1,RIP-OFF!!!,Another way to get your money twice - shame on them. I was duped the first time and bought both versions - not this time!!! They should fire their marketing advisors because I cannot imagine too many people will fall for it this time - the movies are a masterpiece but still a few years old and the rush is simply not there. I'll wait for the extended version.
2,Not a great set,"Now, Warner's been getting a lot of flak here for their double dipping strategy. To be fair to them, it has been made abundantly clear that the Extended Editions are coming later, so it is not as if they are trying to ""trick"" anyone into buying this set.That being said, this is a pretty lazy, lackluster set. Reviews have already been coming out saying that the picture quality, while not bad by any means, are made from older transfers with some technical problems, including Digital Noise Reduction (DNR). Fellowship of the Ring apparently suffers from this the most. Furthermore, the extras are ported straight from the original theatrical DVDs, which means they don't amount to much.Take this information as you will. To me, it means that unless you absolutely want to have the theatrical cuts along with the Extended Editions, this release will ultimately be wasted money once the inevitably superior set is released later down the line. I'm going to wait it out."
1,I'll wait.,Wow. When I heard this was coming out on blu-ray I just assumed that theatrical and extended versions would be included. There's certainly enough room on a blu-ray disc. I'll just watch my DVD's until the extended versions are released.
1,YOU WONT GET ME TWICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,GREED!!!! SHAME ON YOU.. THATS WHY I DONT FEEL SO BAD ABOUT BOOTLEGGERS!! SHAME ON YOU!! ANYONE WHO BUYS THIS VERSION AND THEN THE NEXT ONE DESERVES TO BE RIPPED OFF!!! GREED!!!!
1,Agree,I agree with the rest of the reviews. I won't be buying these until they release the extended versions.
1,Fool me once shame on you...,Fool me twice shame on me... I'll be waiting for the extended cuts to come out on blueray no matter how long it takes. In the meantime I'll enjoy my extended cuts on DVD.
1,Bleh,"I was gonna buy this but thanks to all the informative negative reviews, I'm not. They're all right, bleed us dry!"
1,Pure corporate greed...,"New Line must think that we are a bunch of village idiots! If they think that they are going to get money out of me again, they are sadly mistaken. The only possible way of me buying this set would be if I found it in a blow-out bin for $9.99. Save your money and wait for the extended versions."
1,Why play the game,I have to agree with the reviews. Lets just get the extended version on Blue Ray. I will vote with my pocketbook and wait
1,WTF? Where's the EXTENDED???,No way am I buying 2 sets of these....WASTE OF MONEY....DO NOT BUY!!!!!
1,"Boo, come on! No extended editions, really?! No excuses!","You could kind of understand why they released theatrical editions before, maybe they hadn't cut the extended yet, maybe they didnt want to have to ship and extra DVD per package (due to DVD size restrictions) to reduce costs. Or the most obvious reason maybe they wanted to milk us of more money and the movies had just come out and there was lots of hype. But this time they have the extended cuts ready to go, with Bluray fitting 50GB of data they will be able to fit everything on one disk. Its just not right to pull this crap again, noone buy this, don't support this kind of behavior! Wait for extended edition Bluray!"
1,Lame,The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is by far my most wanted release on Blue Ray. I will not however be purchasing these due to them only containing the theatrical editions. In would recommend countinuing to watch your DVD extended versions over this release regardless of picture quality.
1,no way,"Enough already, New Line! No crappy BluRay with theatrical release. Extended Cut only. How many more times do we need to buy these movies!!!!. We already pay enough for BluRay Players and you expect us to shell out TWICE for your movies, New Line? NOT!!!! Be considerate of your loyal customers, don't screw them over, please."
5,Excellant,The product was brand new in original packaging and sent promptly. Thoroughly enjoyed the movies after reading the entire series.
5,good buy,"this is a good buy. although one does not need all the dvds, it does not hurt to have them. the extra minutes are excellent. if u read the book you would still be left wanting more, but i guess this will give you the most."
5,Great for anyone!!,"This is a perfect present for just about anyone - whether you are a Lord of the Rings fan, a lover of fantasy, or are fascinated with how movies are made (you'll love the behind the scenes extras!). I find myself watching these movies over and over again several times a year, and while the boxed set was a little pricey for a poor college student like myself, I have never regretted the purchase!"
1,Just to add my voice to the petition!,"New Line! You have no shame! What do you think you look like? Instead of having gratitude and respect from LOTR fans around the world, by this cynical act of greed, you alienate us all. There is a growing feeling that Peter Jackson alone, is the man to be thanked for this masterpiece - and you corporate leeches are just that - leeches on the flesh of the film going public! One day we'll pour salt on you and laugh!I urge everyone to boycott the theatrical release. It is my fervant wish that no one buys it, and that New Line lose millions in lost sales!Everyone, don't forget to tell friends and relatives that might be considering buying the theatrical version for you as a Christmas or Birthday gift - that you don't want it and would rather they spent the money on a ""New Line Corporate Leeches Really Suck!"" T-shirt instead!"
1,Can't believe they think we are idiots,I actually appreciate both the extended and theatrical editions. I didn't mind terribly having to buy both versions until....they were released together for less than I paid seperately! Talk about screwing over true fans for a little extra money. They must think we either or stupid or have no self control to fall for the same ploy twice! I cannot believe how arrogant they are!
1,Peter Jackson don't TRY and feed me this BS,"Folks the ONLY way to get the Blueray EXTENDED editions faster is to NOT buy this bollywood scam artists theater editions, rest assured the extended will follow this release and only UNTIL they squezze every last drop out of peoples pockets, shame on you new line cinema, you took a great movie and scarred it for life, it's the fans not the movie that got you all the money in the first place, if they are doing this now i quess the hobbit movie will be a rotten tomatoe 2 star movie, since clearly all this BS peter jackson said from the beginning that these movies are ""FOR THE FANS"" that is officially now BS, since you didn't ASK the fans to vote if we wanted this money making garbage in the first place"
1,Wait for extended edition,"The theatrical edition is getting a low rating due to product quality. The company could just as readily put the extended and theatrical edition on the discs, but continue milking the consumer. When the theatrical editions came out, more time was needed to produce the extended editions since the series was still in production."
1,Studio Execs can do better as BEGGERS,WILL NOT BUY until extended edition is released. Studio Execs are welcome to beg at my door and will donate rather than buy this set.
1,Don't waste your money,"Teach the studios a lesson not to rip us off with all these poor standards in blu-ray transfers. The extended version is 1,000 times better than this theatrical version, plus it is already out on DVD.Just buy the DVD version and tell Blu-Ray to go pound sand."
1,Wait for the extended edition on Blu-ray,Don't waste your money on this when you know there going to make the extended edition on Blu-ray.
1,Don't waste my time new line.,This is rediculous. They expect us to actually consider buying theatrical and extended in seperate boxes still??? GIVE ME A BREAK!!
1,We've waited this long....,"Seriously! Studios have to understand that if they are going to take THIS FREAKING LONG to release a movie onto Blu-Ray only to have it be the theatrical release and not the extended version, people will just continue to wait. IF they (New Line Cinema) had released this theatrical versions two years ago, I might have purchased it and waited for the Extended versions later, knowing this is the way of things. BUT as it stands, for taking SO LONG to come out with the Blu-Ray versions and it ONLY be the theatrical release....I will just wait. I'll wait another couple of years if I have to, I've waited this long...."
1,We are not that Dumb,"You guys(New Line) thought you could keep selling us all sorts of versions for a life time and we would fall for it every time? WRONG. Watch us not fall for this ultra dumb plot of yours. The only one falling for this will be YOU and only YOU.BTW - I have both the versions of DVD. (yes, I have already tasted the sand)"
1,Hope They Lose Money On This,"Only impatients or stupids will buy this if New Line doesn't correct their behavior.Then, when the fire-sale on this release happens, we all will buy it to get an early Blu-Ray look at a reduced price.Hopefully, that means the schedule on the extended version will be accelerated.Did everyone notice the scare tactics that suggest the extended version happens in 2011 or 2012?I predict 2010.Craig"
1,What a Missed Opportunity!,"I love these movies so much that I'm going to get the theatrical releases, then get the extended version releases when they come out...NOT...ain't gonna happen. Bad move. I'm keeping my $$$ and maybe I'll continue to watch my regular movies so much that I won't want the extended cuts. Who knows?"
1,Not buying,Just another one chiming in. I will be wating for the extended release as well. Already felt duped on the DVD versions.
2,"Wait, wait, wait","I plan to buy my Blu-ray player once the full director's cut is released, so I'll join the chorus saying don't spend your money until the Trilogy is released in the version Peter Jackson intended us to see."
2,Not a fanatic!,"I am what you would call a 'moderate fan', (not a LOTR fanatic). That said, even I agree with the other posters. Extended versions please!!!"
1,Extended Edition Please,"What a crock. The studio (as another user has accurately stated quite eloquently) is simply trying to take our money by releasing the theatrical editions, and then the extended editions next year (much like what happened with the DVDs). Please boycott this product"
1,Pass!,"Thanks but no thanks New Line. I had to buy 6 dvds already, and blu-rays are far too pricey to make us double dip. Shame on you. I hope everyone boycotts buying these RIP OFF theatrical blu-rays, and you lose a lot of money because of it. Judging by the over 2,000 negative comments on this set already, despite the fact that it still hasn't even been released yet, my dream may come true. You have a lot of nerve doing that to a group of extremely loyal, diehard fans. You will taste our nerdy wrath."
1,Injustice,"This is FUBAR. I can wait until the extended edition. Noone in their right mind should allow themselves to be screwed over by being asked to purchase a product twice. I, for one, will wait until the product that the consumers prefer is available. If I ran my company like this (flagrantly not listening to it's customers) I would be out of business...maybe the studio SHOULD be."
1,Please make a Shortened Edition with commercials,"Hello! Consumers need Shortened Editions with commercials before diving into Theatrical Editions. Something that's released only in black-and-white with worse resolution than VHS and only featuring mono sound to retain the integrity of the source material, please. Thanks."
1,Hahaha,"Nice try New Line, I think you know where to shove these theatrical version blu-rays.Pathetic."
1,Absolutely no respect for the consumer.,"Grow up, New Line. Do not buy this set. It does not feature the extended editions of the films."
1,$tudio's think they're $lick,"Enough! Studios have been ripping us off for years with double, triple, and (eventual) quadruple dips! I will not upgrade unless the extended versions are released in blu-ray format as well! $hame on you WB! They think buyers are not well-informed but, many are. I hope they take a big loss on this greedy mistake of a release!"
1,STOP!!!! WAIT and buy EXTENDED versions blu-ray LOTR,"Listen, wait and buy the extended edition version of LOTR on bluray when it comes out. DO not buy this theatrical version only bluray, you'll be spending twice the money. This is simply a marketing ploy to see how many suckers there are out there. This edition does have a TEASER preview of the extended DVD version on the bonues disc but big whoop.LOTR is what HP wants to be when it grows up! I mean you know how good HP is, that's how much better LOTR is especially the extended version. Einstein said once you expand your thinking it can never go back to its previous size, once you experience the non-stop 12 hr + journey of the extended LOTR you'll never settle for less. God Bless the director for getting it out.LOTR equals 5 stars...This particular release equals 1 star. Happy shopping and keep the one star reviews coming. Amazon rocks!!!"
1,Blatantly Insulting,These guys are just shameless. Don't let 'em get away with it. Do not buy this release.
1,They have no shame,I was going to buy this until i saw it was'nt extended. How many times do they expect us to buy this movie?
1,Very Very Sad,Theatrical and not extended - why ? just so the studios can make some more money off us the consumerMaybe if we all don't buy this version and wait for the extended we can send a message
1,Won't ever buy this theatrical version,Just read these reviews. I think we are all tired of movies being double dipped. My regular dvds of these movies will suffice for now. Will spend on the blu ray version of the extended versions once those come out. Don't care if it'll take years for it to come out. I can wait.
1,I Hope Waiting For The Extended Version Isn't an Extended Wait,LOTR is my all time favorite movie. I have the Theatrical and Extended Versions. This is double dipping. I want the Blu-Ray Extended Version
1,Garbage,Really ... Why not just sell the extended versions now so I can get busy wearing them out or breaking them!!!
1,new line shamelessly milking franchise,A blu ray release of the trilogy should obviously include both versions of all three films. Shame.
1,No extended version - no sale,"Add me to the list of people who will not be buying this. The extended versions are too good and contain too much material that is intrinsic to the original story for me to buy the theatrical releases. If they bring the extended releases out on Blu-ray, I will buy as soon as I can. Until then, my wife and I will just continue to watch the extended versions on standard DVD's annually."
1,Theatrical is not worth it...,"I won't buy the theatrical versions only when we all know that the extended versions are on their way some time in the future. Lucas has already gouged me for 3-4 different versions of the original Star Wars trilogy. I refuse to let Jackson & Co. do it to me again. As Michael Scott sayeth, ""Fool me once, strike one. Fool me twice... strike three."""
1,Extended version or nothing,"What a waste of effort and money to release this theatrical version. The extended version is the only version worth having and even then it falls short of the books.Save your money, get the real thing!"
1,I too vote for only buying the extended version,"Sorry, but there is NO reason to buy the Theaterical version of LOTR's, so I'm waiting it out."
2,Extended or Nothing...,I will not buy until it's Extended without having to change discs. The DVD version looks great on HD and my blu-ray player upconverts nicely. Good enough until Newline gets their act together.
1,complete rip off,"complete rip off. i agree with everyone else that is disappointed they would release the ""theatrical version"" (nice marketing - try to make it seem more impressive than it is) of the film now, knowing most want the extended version.second, if it's not available, how can there be so many reviews of it already? new line probably hired some people to pose as real customers and give it some good reviews to promote pre-ordering. of course, i doubt they are the only company that does that.anyway, i'd wait till they release the extended version. standard definition looks just fine until then."
1,Format whoring,"Yes - we're all fed up of the mercenary profiteering and contempt we the consumers are held in by the studios. We've all had it stuck to us by the nonsensical and restrictive practice of the DVD Regions regime and as for this continuing, sickening 'format whoring' - what comes next 3d BluRay? I'm no Luddite but enough already!!!!!"
1,Saruman's Revenge & Gandalf's Pipe!,"Warner Bros./New Line would be wise to put all their attention into making one stellar bluray release with both versions of the film and all previously included extras. They should then supplement this package with newer extras updating fans on the LOTR trilogy phenomenon, Hobbit film information etc.By releasing this monumental movie achievement in the same piecemeal fashion they did the standard DVDs, New Line is telling fans that they have absolutely no respect for them or the environment upon which they seem content to dump millions of unnecessary bluray discs. Talk about Saruman's revenge!Warner Bros. execs should ask themselves, (what would Aragorn do?) and react accordingly. Give fans everything in one pristine package. Charge a little more if they have to and confine the smoke blowing to Gandalf's pipe."
1,Not The Extended Edition,Going to save my money and buy the extended edition. Just adding my 1-star to the pile.
1,extended edition or nothing,"I add my one star (I would give 0 if possible) just for the statistics. I guess they're gonna sell quite a few copies of the theatrical edition anyway, but for me, it's extended edition or nothing ..."
1,boo - extended edition please,"just a quick note, this is just the theatrical editon, they need to know to release this on the extended edition blu-ray. don't buy this and demand they release the real edition."
1,Nice try New Line!,"New Line, there is an amazing invention out there called the internet that allows us to find out when we are about to be ripped off. I bought three different versions of LOTR on DVD. I have also spent hundreds on various licensed video games and countless trinkets. Thank you for rewarding the fans' loyalty. No wonder you've been sued by both Peter Jackson and the Tolkien estate. Good luck with this, New Line. I'll see you when you release the real Blu Ray set."
1,"Money Ploy, kick it back!!!","Theatrical release on blu ray...soon to be followed by extended release; what disrespect to fans in general, no ethics involved by New Line, how can they approve such a trash decision. Unbelievable...."
1,How stupid,"As MANY others have said, do NOT buy this version. Wait for the extended version. With the capability of blu-ray, there is NO reason to have released these as a seperate version, EXCEPT greed on the part of New Line. If I could rate it below a 1 I would."
1,How hard is it to make a Theatrical + Extended Edition,"How hard would it be for the studio to make a Theatrical & Extended Edition on the same set. In an era of movies coming out in Blu-Ray, DVD and digital copies in the same box, why make fans pay for each version separately.Bolt (Three-Disc Edition w/ Standard DVD + Digital Copy + BD Live) [Blu-ray]The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Editions) [Blu-ray]"
1,This is LAME,"First of all, why has it taken so long for these to hit blu-ray. Secondly, it's very lame to not include or at least release a separate set of the extended cuts. *Sigh* More waiting."
1,No Extended Edition = No Sale,"Please do not reward this blatant attempt at getting us, the consumers, to buy two versions of these films. Actually, it would most likely be a third, as I am sure many of us have them on DVD already. Amazon reviews seem to be something that companies actually pay attention to, so it is one of the better platforms to voice displeasure with this decision. Speak with both your wallet and rating, and rate this at one star."
1,Old trick: buy It now and buy It later!,"This is really a scam. I'm sure they plan this thinking of selling LOTR trilogy two times for the same costumer. One now, and one when the Extend version is out! Ridiculous!!!"
1,Scummy marketers,No fan would buy anything but the extended editions on Blu-Ray. This release is just abusing family and friends who buy these discs for a fan only to disappoint. Shame on the marketing team!
1,This needs to be six disc's...,"These movies are all three hours plus, you won't get both versions on the same blu-ray disc, at least not if you want them to look good. I would rather have two disc's for each movie, making this a six disc set."
1,Wait for the extended version,I have only seen the theatrical versions once or twice each and only in the theater. The extended versions are superior in every way and I will not support a double dip.
1,This is horse pucky!,those jerks really expect us to fall for this crap?!?! for the amount of money these films have made they can very much afford to release the extended versions.....don't they want to make more money?? dummies in the marketing dept. i guess..
1,Want the extended version,I totally agree with C. Burns. The studio (Peter Jackson) made a beautiful movie (or 3) and know that the fans want the extened version. Please don't burn us twice. Release the extended versions!
1,While I understand the detractors...,"I'll be joining the massive group of one starers to protest this release. Sadly, we are actually in the minority of buyers in the entire US of A. A huge amount of people don't give a bean to either or here. Most just remember the theatrical release and Blu-ray being a new media format, wouldn't mind buying this version to relive what they experienced when walking into the bijou."
1,Extended Versions Please,"I get that some people prefer the shorter theatrical versions, but that's no reason at all to withhold the CHOICE! I purchased the theatrical DVDs and the Extended DVDs, so I guess I can wait for the Extended BluRays, but it's just insulting that they're doing this double-dip again."
1,Scam,"First the credit card companies, then the health insurance industries, and now this. So okay it's not quite the same thing but still. Everyone is always trying to rip you off, even the friendly shiny movie people."
1,Waiting for both versions on 1 disc,"Simply put I will only buy the LOTR Blu-ray when both the theatrical and extended versions are put on the same disc so I have the option to watch whichever version I choose by selecting it from the menu. The sooner they release that, the sooner they get my money."
2,Same for me,"While I love these movies (and have both theatrical and extended releases on dvd), I will save my money and wait for the extended versions on blu-ray. This will also give me more time to buy a blu-ray player!"
3,How about the extended edition?,What about the extended edition? I don't care about the theatrical version. Once you see the extended you can't go back. Bring the extended edition in blu ray and then we can talk business (aka my spending money on the dvd)
3,Why not Extended edition?,"The movie (in standard DVD extended edition) is very good, but I can't see what the point of buying this in BluRay if it's not the extended version - I'll just wait and buy it when the extended version comes out and just keep watching the standard DVD extended version until then."
1,"Why the ""short"" version?","Why release the ""short"" versions of the movies. If you're going for the best format, have the decency to provide full versions. I have to side with other reviewers, one star for the product, although the fantastic movies deserve a 5."
2,Only the extended versions in Blu Ray would make any sense,"I own the extended DVD editions, I would buy nothing less than extended Blu Ray versions. I too bought the theatrical versions and then the extended trilogy series. The shorter versions are of no interest. I can watch this film in HD all the time for free on TNT network."
1,LOTR BLU-RAY = LORD OF THE RIP-OFFS !!!!!!!,"Like most of you, I bought both the Theatrical and Extended versions, but felt ripped-off by the studios for ""double-dipping"" us loyal LOTR fans. With the blu-ray version out next week, I am not the only one that feels the studios is trying to do the same thing again!! On top of that, most of the reviews agree the blu-ray transfer is terrible!! If you feel the same way I do, I am asking for everyone to boycott and not buy the blu-ray until they release a quality blu-ray transfer of the Extended version only. I can wait for as long as it takes and hope you do not fall into the studios plot to rip off the blu-ray consumers time-and-time again!!"
1,I want both theatrical & extended versions on 1 Blu Ray!!!!!!!!!!!!,I agree with others who would rather see extended release together with theatrical on one blu. I already have one set of theatrical and don't see any need to upgrade to the same content. Upconverting dvd must be enough for now.
1,Blu-Ray Quality looks mediocre! What's next? A Special Edition?,"The guy is very right. Another marketing trick just to fill ur library with 4 trilogies!! The DvD theatrical, DVD extended, Blu-Ray theatrical, Blu-Ray Extended-- a total of $200-300 just because we love the movie!!And by watching the Blu-ray screenshots it's easy to tell that there hasn't been much work done in clearing up the special effects which DO LOOK BLURRY!!Under my opinion they will release a digital remastered version too!!When the extended version get released they should have an exchange option!!"
1,Joining the crowd,"I want to thank those who (rather loudly) pointed out this was the the theatrical version of the series. As I did the ""buy one, upgrade later"" routine three times before (my fault on the second and third times ) I mistakenly assumed they'd put the best on Blu-ray rather than go back and start over.I realize we're rating a product we haven't seen yet, so I'd just like to make it clear I'm rating the _idea_ of getting put through this runaround again when the material is there already to just go ahead and put out the extended editions.How about this, New Line? Put out the extended edition, then let Peter Jackson search through his archives for what ever else he could possibly not have used, and then put out a new, ""Ultra"" edition later? That way we get the best of what's available now, and the new edition will probably be in 3D Blu-ray by then. :)"
1,Waiting for Extended Editions,"This is a sad example of greed. If it wasn't greed, they would release both versions at once or put both versions on one set of discs."
1,SHARE WITH A FRIEND,"Don't buy this. Wait for the extended edition.The only way Time Warner / New Line Cinema's decision to release a theatrical only edition makes sense is if fans buy BOTH the theatrical AND the extended edition. Otherwise they don't make any more money.Unfortunately this bone-head decision doesn't cost them anything other than a little time. People that don't know better will buy this theatrical edition while us true fans will have to wait, but they know we will still spend our money in a few years when they release the extended edition.So here's what I'm going to do: I'm not going to buy my own copy of the extended edition. When the extended edition comes out I will pool money with some friends and we'll share the movie - this is the only way to penalize New Line Cinema: they need to understand that this greedy decision will actually end up costing them money."
1,"#2 asks, ""How do you rate this item?"" Not, ""How do you rate this movie?""","EDIT 111709/0737 PST: Amazon had to lower the price by fifteen dollars. Don't fall for it! Wait for the extended version. If the price of this gets to twenty buck, I'll pick one up. 'Till then, I'm out.I'd give this item zero stars if it was possible. This is exactly what other 1-star reviews have called it, a blatant money-grabbing venture by New Line. First, the absolute worst of the two HD formats wins the war because of crummy PS3 popularity (admit it, BD Java sucks!), now we get invited to spend beaucoup bucks on a second-class edition... 'edit:-also, the PQ of the DVDs is so excellent, why bother paying for BD PQ until the Extended Version is released?"
1,2 VERSION SEPARATE RELEASE AGAIN!!!???? B***S***!!!,"I am with everyone else, unbelievable to think they could trick us into paying for both versions again, alas I did buy both versions on DVD, but I shall not do that again this time around! With that said I CANT'T WAIT for the HIGH DEFINITION EXTENDED RELEASE (hopefully with both versions together) to come out!!!"
1,Where is the extended version,Love the movie - but I want to get the extended versionI already have the regular and extended DVD versions - and the extended version is worth the time.
1,New Line = GREED!!!,"It's nice to see the fans stand up to New Line trying to double-dip us into buying these films twice! New Line is horribly run company and should be ashamed of themselves. First they screwed Peter Jackson out of his rightful share of the film's profits and destroying any chance of him directing the Hobbit. And now they are screwing with us on the Blu-Ray release! I guess they need a bail out from the fans, because LOTR is all they have. It's the only hit they have had this decade. Now if we can just stand up to Lucas:)"
1,Movie Studio Greed at its Worst,"Peter Jackson mentioned he will release the Extended Edition trilogy on Blu-Ray in 2011, to coincide with the release of The Hobbit's theatrical release. The two-year wait would be long enough to convince *suckers* into buying this non-extended release, and hopefully buy it again in 2011.Sorry, I'll be content with my Extended Edition DVDs until the Extended Editions get released on Blu-Ray. I feel that everyone is in the same camp as me. I may even pirate these versions in protest, but I will NEVER buy this knowing WB is purposely delaying the Extended Editions by two years.Hopefully, the amount of protest by the series' fans will reach the studio heads at WB and Peter Jackson. But likely it will fall on deaf ears. The same greedy idiots will be splitting The Hobbit into two movies (because one movie just isn't enough hype), so we already know that WB only cares about stretching the dollar with the series."
1,Don't be fooled,Just adding my support to the overwhelming majority. Hurry up and give us the extended versions that we all want.
1,Don't waste you money!,I have no intention on buying just the theatrical versions.Wait for the extended + theatrical release and don't waste your money.
1,Double-dipping again New Line? Please...,"You fooled me once when you released Fellowship of the Ring - THEATRICAL EDITION on DVD only to release it again several months later in an Extended version package. Fooled me once, yes, but the next 2 installments had me grinning and rocking on my heels before the Extended versions were released in a similar fashion.Now you're trying the same thing on Blu-Ray? No. I won't even buy it if there was a threat that the extended editions were never to be released on Blu-Ray. Give us the Extended versions on Blu-Ray or nothing at all. The Extended versions were definitely the way the movies were intended to be seen, especially the scene with Saruman in Return of The King (theatrical = Saruman goes *poof*).Don't be fooled people...and don't let New Line make idiots of us again."
1,Won't be screwed again!,"I already bought both the theatrical release, and then the directors cut/extended edition. Maybe someone else even bought the all three versions where they released the movie on one disc. Surely blue ray technology would allow both on one, or lets say it can't. Then put both discs in. How flippin greedy!If I were ever on a jury and someone was being tried for illegally downloading from a studio that did this, they would get an instant free pass from me!"
1,save your money!,"I have been buying videos and DVD'S for over 20 years and I have one simple rule when it comes to purchasing movies: If I already have it on regular DVD, the heck with the Blu ray version! The only Blu Ray movies I buy are movies that I don't own at all! When I converted over from VHS to DVD, it was worth it because of the widesceen format! You only have so much time in life to watch TV and your videos and play your video games! Stop buying stuff you already have! Spend your money wisely! Buy something you've never seen before! You might discover something else that's worth watching!!! However, if you don't own these movies at all, wait for the extended versions!!! Blu Ray is a gimmick and with the re-releases of all your favorite movies, it doesn't mean you should buy everything all over again!!!"
1,Nope... Nope... Nope!!!,"I will not be doped into buying this Bluray twice like I did the DVDs. I will NOT waste my money on buying the ""theatrical version"" when I know full well that the studios will be releasing the ""extended version"" sometime in the near future. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM! Make the studios pay for this degrading and despicable way of doing business!!!"
1,Won't be ripped off!!,Do not buy this product. Only custommers can put an end on this billion versions release!
1,Ridiculous,"Absolutely ridiculous that the theatrical cut was released without the extended cut as well. I bought the theatrical cuts on DVD originally, then the extended versions of all 3. I've been tempted to buy the blu-ray release, but upon finding out they aren't the long versions it's an easy temptation to resist."
1,they almost caught me,"I wasn't paying attention and I pre-ordered the theatrical versions. As soon as I noticed what I had done, I cancelled the order. I can wait, but then, why should I have to? What's up with these guys? Why can't they just do the right thing and be done with it? I will enjoy walking through the stores and seeing all the copies of the theatrical versions sitting on the shelves.J"
1,Greed and Avarice,I'm disgusted. New Line already made a bundle on fans as we bought the theatrical versions and then the extended versions. In return for our support they tell us to bend over and do it again. I'll wait. New Line should be ashamed!
1,Cheap trick...,"We all know the drill: release the theatrical version now, grab as much money from anxious buyers as you can; then, a few months down the road, release the extended version, and make a sizable percentage of those first-time buyers to shell out their money again - it's a win-win scenario!"
1,Save your money for the deluxe edition,"Read the fine print, folks -- this item contains the THEATRICAL cuts of each film. Plus, with a total of only 6 discs, there isn't much room for extras. Think about it -- the deluxe editions of the first two films already have 50% more discs than this entire box set!It's well known that Peter Jackson is hard at work putting together a mammoth deluxe box set of the LOTR trilogy that will include not only new special features, but also the theatrical AND the extended versions of all three films. In particular, the extended version of ROTK is rumored to dramatically improve the narrative flow of that already-excellent conclusion to what is perhaps the greatest movie trilogy of all time.It's hard to see who would be interested enough in LOTR to buy this set, but not interested enough to wait for the definitive edition of the films on DVD."
1,Absolute shenanigans!!,"I should have known that other studios would follow other shills like our most esteemed corporate greedmaster George Lucas. I am really confused as to how many times companies expect us to buy the same thing. 2011/12 for the EE???!!!! Really?? Give me a freaking break! The only reason they're doing that is to tie in with the Hobbit release and cash in! There is no reason the EE should not be out now! This is the same exact BS we got fed for the Star Wars original trilogy DVD's. Don't support this release and keep this ridiculous system going. A trash movie that comes out this month will be on full bells and whistles Bluray release in 3 months, and we're talking about films that are going on a decade old now people! These are done and in the can and ready for release, I don't need 175 hours of extra special newly discovered behind the scenes footage of Peter Jackson giving Hobbit foot rubs!"
1,Wait until the EXTENDED version comes out,"If you are like most people who already has the DVD version of LOTR (theatrical version), don't bother purchasing the DVD Blu Ray version. Wait until the Extended version comes out for DVD Blu Ray which will probably be around next Christmas 2010. It will definitely be worth the wait !"
1,New Line support your fans,What a cheep way to make a buck. If you cared anything for your fans you would listen. Release the EE.
1,"Hollywood, please come to your senses, if any...","Extended edition or we will not buy!! New Line, you are hurting yourselves because some greedy, greasy exec woke up one morning and decided this would be a good idea... Just release the darn thing!!"
1,Lame!!! Give Us The Extended Versions!,This makes me really sad to see that New Line Cinema would rather use and manipulate its fans into buying the original movie series only to have to buy the extended versions one year later. They are preying on the support of its greatest fans in order to make a few bucks. I would rather the company show its care towards its fans and release the extended editions at an increased price along side the original series. I would be willing to pay whatever extra more per movie in order to receive the extended version when the original comes out. I hate that I have to pass this one up in order to wait for the extended editions to come out on Blu Ray.
1,Another screw job.,"Yet another blatant attempt by the studios to milk people of their extra cash. The extended versions have been around forever now. WHY not release them on Blu-ray from the get-go? There is only one explanation for this, and that is MONEY GRAB.Warner Brothers should be shamed for this kind of distasteful business practice. VOTE IT DOWN and send a message!"
1,Complete Joke...,Just echoing what everyone else has said. Just nauseating... I already was a sucker buying the theatrical and then the extended versions of the DVD's. I will not be a fool twice. Will be waiting for the extended versions...
1,Double dipping my wallet (again....),"Like so many people, I already own the extended version on DVD. I was lucky enough to only buy Fellowship theatrical and then realized what they were doing so held out until I could get all three extended versions. Now I see they are releasing the theatrical version of this on blu-ray first. With so many great movies becoming available on blu-ray, not to mention the availability of movies through NetFlix, why would I throw money away on this? I will wait until the extended version is released on blu-ray."
1,This blows,I agree with everyone else. Extended versions or I'm not buying. Utter crap that they try and screws us.
1,Lord of the Rings Blu Ray Theatrical Version,"I am so disappointed in the studio's decision to milk their LOTR fans with a ""theatrical only"" version in Blu Ray format. According to Amazon.com, the extended release is not expected until 2011 to 2012, which is absolutely absurd !!! This is a blatant disregard to what the fans of LOTR really want. I wish there was a way to pressure the studio into offering the extended version much sooner. I will definitely not support the studio by buying their ""theatrical only"" version. Shame on them !!!"
3,Lord of the Rings extended version,"The first disc of The Fellowship of the Ring had a sticky spot on it. I don't know if it was honey or what. Even after cleaning the disc, the screen would preiodically dissolve into pixils while playing. Disc 2 has a scratch on it which also caused the screen to dissolve into pixils."
1,This is such a joke. Can you be any more greedy New Line Cinema?,This is pure B.S. Blu-ray has ample disc size to include both theatrical and extended release formats; absolutely greedy and pathetic of a business. Everyone vote this down and hopefully this movie-conglomerate jerk (New Line Cinema) will repackage this to include both versions.
2,No extended editions. No good.,These are still great movies but not providing us with the extended versions is pure greed and a big ripoff.Do not support this release. Do not buy this set.
1,Fool Me Once Shame On You...,Fool Me Twice Shame on Me...I will wait till all three extended versions are available.
1,This is a scam to get us to purchase it all twice,"I agree with all the above reviews, this is a scam to get us to purchase it all twice. I will simply wait......................it will be sweeter then anyways. Only disagreement with above, it's not the beancounter! We don't get to make decisions."
1,Go ahead and buy the theatrical editions ... because you're too impatient for the whole story,"The extended editions still take ""some"" liberties with the story, but if you want to watch the versions cut short so they could fit 5 shows a day in the theater, then be my guest. I'm fairly certain you also cut short your kids' softball games because they run over as well. :-)BTW, I call ""shenanigans"" on WB for creating a ""Blu-Ray edition trailer"" that pulls music from ""Gladiator"" & ""Requiem for a Dream"". :-("
1,Worthless waste of money.,"Could not wait to get this set. I have the VHS set, DVD regular, but only the 2nd and 3rd extended. I ended up getting this instead of buying extended #1. 1st movie skips and loses sounds for around 10 seconds on both sides. 2nd movie skips a whole chapter or something on both sides. And the 3rd skips from like the middle to the end. Couldn't even watch them. I even returned them for a brand new replacement, and they do the same thing. Can not believe they were released like this. Very unprofessional."
1,Booo Trying to cheat people,Come one there is no accuse for this its totally a rip off double dipping is bullshit you should know better than trying to cheat your customers like this im sad to be liveing in a world were companys abuse there customer and also try to rip them of there is no accuse for there not being both versions of the film on blue ray and all i have to say to those people is BOOOO!!!!! on youdont get it
2,"LOTR theatrical release on Blu-Ray: great movies, terrible version","These are great movies, but the fact that they put out the theatrical releases on Blu-Ray rather than release the extended editions (or put both on one set of discs) is a little ridiculous. I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if it was the extended edition of the trilogy - with the extra capacity of Blu-Ray and the fact that the work is done there's no reason not to release those.Unless they release an extra-extended release that has even more content and enhancements over the extended edition release, this is a rip-off. It's sad, and disappointing, but I'm going to hold out until there's a decent edition on Blu-Ray."
1,don't buy this version,Just like many of you have stated. this is a ploy by the studio to get us to buy twice. Hold out for the extended versions on blu ray.
1,Wait for the extended version,It's all about the cash. They want our money I only want to spend it once.
1,"Boycotted LOTR Blu-ray, you should too!!!","Complete and utter BS, my BD player (which upscales to 1080i) will suffice with my already purchased extended versions.Such sickening greed."
1,Lord of the Ring,I will not buy the theatrical versions. After watching the extended versions the theatrical versions are no longer enjoyable. I will wait to buy these movies on BluRay when the extended versions are released. Releasing the theatrical versions and not the extended versions is a rip off.
1,Shame.,Pure Greed. Simple as that. Will be waiting for the Extended Versions. ..to think the MPAA is so surprised when people pirate movies.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I'm eagerly awaiting LOTR on Blu-Ray but I will not purchase the theatrical editions. Why they have to wait and release the Extended Editions at a later date is beyond me. But I shall wait, as should you."
1,What a ripoff,"I can't believe they are yet again trying to make everyone buy the movies twice! This is really aggravating, and I won't stand for it."
1,Why bother?,"Seriously, why bother? I worked at Blockbuster at the time of the DVD releases, and with a little know-how with the search function, I (along with a LOT of my customers) became aware of the extended versions that were to come.Now we know that the extended versions are coming out on BD, why would anyone bother buying the theatrical release? Come on New Line, you don't think we're stupid do you?"
1,"Don't buy Theatrical Cut, they might release Extended sooner!","They could easily have 2 versions on one disk and switch through the menu. Instead we get some marketing rubbish.So comes the negative review. The lesser rating it has, the fewer people will buy it, the sooner we'll get an extended cut!"
4,Falta de informacion!!!,"Bueno,el problema es que no indican si las versiones extendidas de la trilogia estan TODAS subtituladas tambien en español. Envie un email al Customer Service de Amazon pero hasta ahora no me responden y ya van mas de 12 dias. Las versiones extendidas individuales no incluyen subtitulos en español, excepto The Return of the King. Asi que por favor ya que amazon no responde diganme alguno de Uds amigos compradores si es que en esta Trilogia si vienen TODAS las peliculas subtituladas al español.Por falta de informacion como esta solo he comprado la version extendida de The Return of the King cuando pude haber comprado la version extendida de la Trilogia.Gracias"
5,great films on blu ray,"Great films on blu ray, if you wanted the extended version, just keep you standards for now, I'm sure they will be releasing it sometime. By now being movie buyers you all should see how the studios systems work. This is how they make money. Just live with it or not, either way these movie look good and for all I care, I'm happy with these ones. I kept my extended versions and I've only watched them about 20 times, but it takes all day!!! I need more Simpsons time, so these theaterical will do just fine for me."
1,shame... shame...,seriously.... im glad there is an uprising. five stars (or more) for the films. no stars for this money grabbing b.s.
1,They're milking us fans for all we got.,"I'm not buying this release. The ONLY release I will buy has to have both the theatrical release as well as the extended version ON ONE DISC. Just like the first ranked reviewer states, the theater is just trying to rip us off again. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
1,Where is the Extended Version?,"I was so excited to see the Lord of the Rings Trilogy finally available in Blu-Ray! But when I saw it was the short version, not the extended version, I almost cried! I will NOT buy the short version of a movie when the extended version should be available. This is another gimmick to rip off consumers and fans rather than offer a quality product.I've made two resolutions regarding media: 1. No regular version if an extended version exists. I'll wait... forever if I need to! And 2 (unrelated), I will never buy a half-season DVD TV series again. We're tired of the rip-offs!"
1,I have to agree,"I normally do not post any review/comment on Amazon, but this absolutely noble and purposeful one-star-review protest for the beguiling theatrical edition blu-ray set of the Great LOTR trilogy resonates so strongly that I just had to post this as my response; I refuse to be hoodwinked once again!"
1,Just Say No to Thugs!,"Yes, one star for this stereo typical studio tactic. Initially releasing ONLY the theatrical versions until sales have dwindled to nothing and then we get the ""New and improved"" product that they had waiting under their wings the whole time.Holding out on us huh? Why I Otta... I strongly recommend that You and I the customers eliminate this pathetically transparent / Double your Money making sleazy tactic and NOT! Repeat, NOT purchase these releases. We have the Money. They want our money. We have the power to stop this greedy tactic by being smart enough NOT to keep buying into this. Do we want to complain? Or do we want to finally take a stand? What could be simpler. Just don't buy it! I'm not."
1,Why Would I buy this on Blu Ray for only the Theatrical Versions,Why would the distributor waste resources putting all the films on Blu Ray and ONLY contain the Theatrical Versions of all three LOTR Films. We or most of us already own the extended editions on DVD and logic would follow that the extended editions would find their way to Blu-Ray. What's the deal with reselling the theatrical versions of The LOTR Trilogy on Blu-Ray and not also offering customers the OPTION to purchase the LOTR Trilogy on Blu Ray in the extended edition form?
1,Gotta agree this is a shameful release!,Shameful to not give us the extended cut of the film to double dip on fans. I am adding my voice to boycott this edition until the full version is released. The film is wonderful worthy of 5 stars but this release isn't. :(
1,Not Gonna Buy!,"If you want my money...make these extended editions now and don't try to rip me off buy only releasing the theatrical versions on blu ray. For this price, they need to be the extended editions or substantially lower in cost."
1,Miserable option,"Let's see, you could get the shortened version of the theatrical release, or wait and get the extended version which is much better than the theatrical. The choice here is obvious, especially if you already own the extended version on DVD - you know what you want the HD version for!"
2,Lord of the Rings Trilogy Blu Ray,Once again the studios are trying to double dip and sell you the basic versions of the movies when they have already released the extended editions on dvd. Yes the Movies are definately going to be better on Blu ray but i wll not buy this and i will wait until the extended editions become available and then i will only have to buy the trilogy once and get the far better version.
1,"Rent Theatrical, but wait for Extended to Buy","Of course I won't deny myself watching Lord of the Rings Theatrical version on Blu-ray as soon as it is released. However, I will be renting it, not owning it. I'll wait for the extended version before buying my own copy. Might even wait for the 3rd blu-ray release when they eventually combine Theatrical and Extended options in one set (which they should have offered on this first release)."
1,No extended edition?,Waste of time and money to release the theatrical version instead of the extended. I'll wait for the extended version.
1,Theatrical? Are you kidding me?,Who is actually going to buy the theatrical editions? I can't believe they actually did this! It's obvious they just want people to buy this and then re-buy the extended versions when they come out 6 months later. Screw that. I'm holding out for the extended version.
1,Milking Us For Every Dollar!,"Well its all been said, but why would they release this non extended version? There could only be one reason because they are so damn greedy! I think that New Line may be getting the idea, by the amount of posts which show most people are really fed up with this corporate greed. I as most of you bought both editions previous and I will not be buying this blue ray version until it's the extended version. Thanks for the heads up everyone...I guess they will have extra copies of this release laying around. Bargain bin here they come!"
1,Don't buy this version!!!!!!!!,I wasn't fooled the first time and they won't get me this time either. Ridiculous!
1,Pointless purchase.,I am in absolute agreement with the other reviewers. Don't purchase this product. Wait for the extended version which will arrive sooner or later.
1,Love LOTR extended edition but not this one,"I absolutely adore LOTR, the extended version, but I'll be damned if I will purchase the theatrical version on blu-ray. They can forget it! If they choose to release the extended trilogy on Blu-ray, I will purchase it tomorrow. Until then, sorry Mr. Jackson!"
1,Don't waste your money. Wait for the Extended Edition.,"There is absolutely no reason for this product to exist. The extended DVD version rendered the theatrical versions of the DVD, the extended Blues will do the exact same to this set.I do hope the manufacturers of the Extended Version Blu-Rays will provide an elaborate packaging not inferior to the box set for the Extended DVD set, which made it a worthwhile purchase."
1,Technology moves much faster than the movie industry.,"This shouldn't be just the theatrical edition. It should be both the Theatrical and Extended editions. C'mon, it's Blu-ray. You can easily put both versions on there. The movie company is just trying to milk LotR fans and get them to buy the same movie 4 times (DVD, DVD extended, BD, BD extended). I won't pay for this, and neither should anyone else. Save your money for the extended edition. Just rent this if you need to see the LotR in full Hi-Def."
1,No extended editions until 2011 or 2012!?!,Why would anybody want to buy Blu-Ray editions of the theatrical version of these movies? The extended versions are SO MUCH BETTER. It's just money-grabbing nonsense that would drive them to wait two years longer to release the versions that everybody really wants to see. I'd sooner watch my DVDs of the extended version again than I would even put this version in my Netflix queue.
1,"Waste of money, for them and us...",Releasing the theatrical versions on Bluray instead of the Extended editions is a waste of both New Line Cinema's and our time as consumers. Nobody is foolish enough to buy these when we know damned well the extended editions are right around the corner.
1,No!,"Ridiculous decision if they actually release the theatrical versions only. Times being leaner, give us a good reason to buy yet another version."
4,remmark....,The only one thing is that first movie is only available in english and it hasn't subtitle in spanish
1,Downloading films rips of the movie makers.,Downloading films rips of the movie makers.This kind of movie marketing rips of the genuine movie goers/lovers.'Honesty is such a lonely word.'Billy Joel was right.
4,EXTENDED EDITION PLEASE,It's a shame with BD's seamless branching tech that we are getting slammed with this obvious double dip.The huge LOTR fanbase that has already purchased many DVDs deserves better treatment than this.Shame on New Line and Peter Jackson for their blatant greed.
4,"Blu-Ray LOTR Theatrical Version is good, but can't wait for Extended Version","As a LOTR fan since I was in high school in the mid 70s, I never thought Tolkien's books could be brought to the screen. Peter Jackson and friends proved it could be done. Is it perfect? No, but pretty darn close. The Blu-ray DVD is amazing and I only hope that the Extended Versions are coming sooner rather than later. After that bring on The Hobbit!"
3,This Product does have a Target Audience.,"I have seen and enjoyed all three movies. i am not reviewing the movies. i am reviewing this product. it happens to be the theatrical version of the movies. if that is all you want, then this is the blu ray for you. God knows that thirty years from now, if they had never released the theatrical editions--everyone would loose their minds asking peter jackson what his problem was in not releasing the theatrical editions. just look at the star wars saga to see that very example in living color played out to this day. but, if you are like thousands of other fans, you want an edition (an ultimate edition that has both regular and extended editions). Fine, then, you will have to wait. in the mean time, there's always netflix."
1,We're waiting!,"I'll keep this short and sweet. I'm not buying this on blu-ray until you give us the Extended Version. I love LOTR, but this is a complete rip-off, and I'm not falling for it."
1,Another Voice of Dissent,"I have learned not to expect much from the corporate studios but the usual greedy money-grubbing and tasteless, insulting fare. When I think of the good books they have managed to ruin and the excellent fare they have chosen to pass up, my blood boils. But I should probably be glad they haven't attempted some of my favorite books, eh?The movies get a resounding 5+ stars and if 10 were available I would give that.This product/packaging gets a resounding 0 from me. I am waiting for the extended versions."
1,"Trick me once, shame on you. Trick me twice, shame on me.","I'll be more than happy to purchase the extended additions when they are released. This is nothing but gouging the public in the midst of an economic downturn which is both unethical and distasteful. Like school on Sunday, no class!"
1,Money Loser!,"All I can say is they are going to lose a ton of money unless they press a very small number of discs, if this review thread in any way reflects the general publics feelings. I'm a big fan of the trilogy - I saw both versions once a week every week they were in the theater and got three different versions of the dvd's but like the vast majority of people here, i'm going to wait for the EE's. I may even wait to buy them used just so Warner's and PJ don't profit. Fitting punishment, I say. Who cares if they're being upfront about screwing the fans for a second double dip? How about just once giving the fans what they want and keeping them happy?"
1,"Don't waste your money on this edition, wait for the next.","As much as I love LOTR, watching all three films in a short space of time is a significant time commitment. One I can only justify to do only once in a while. If I'm going to be dedicating so much time to watching these films again then I expect it to be the full extended editions, not the cut down theatrical versions. I think most fans would agree."
1,The Perfect Trilogy With An Incomplete Package,"Peter Jackson's lord of the Rings has truly revolutionized that way people watch and make movies today, with that said this Blu-ray set is down right disappointing. The Extended edition can easily be considered perfect! and without this you might as well buy the theatrical versions for under $15!Not only are the extended edition DVDs astounding but the dvd extras are the other half of the perfect married couple! with out them this Blu-ray is a crushing blow to all fans alike and should easily be skipped. he best thing to do is simply wait for a few months for the extended edition (which will probably contain both extended and theatrical editions) and buy that version... if you're willing to pay for it. If you are interested in buying this set you should instead go out NOW and rent or buy the Extended DVDs for around $15-20 each today... its worth it."
1,This is crazy,There is no way I am wasting my money on this set. I will wait for the extended editions.
2,"Great movie, if you can watch it.","This is pretty much my all-time fave movie. Sadly, the discs would not play on my blu-ray player and had to return them. Sad face."
3,Any one please explain specific differences between two versions?,"I see a lot of people complaining about theatrical editions. How much difference between two versions? I only have one set of DVDs (Theatrical, I assume), and I am not sure if I want to wait longer for the extended version. Those who have both versions of DVD, would you please list some differences? Thank you so much. (I left 3 stars because I feel undecided at this time)."
1,double-dipping money grubbing thieves,Does New Line not realize that fans of LOTR are smarter enough not to fall for the same baloney twice? What a joke this is in this economy to gyp fans out of the best versions of these masterpieces and release both versions on separate Blu-rays. If this set is this price I can't imagine what the extended release versions will be priced at. Gimme a break. I'll wait til Black Friday this year for a more appropriate price for this trilogy.
4,La mejor trilogia del siglo,Lo unico que le falta es subtitulos en español para el primer episodio de la trilogia
2,THEATRICAL VERSION OR NOTHING,"WE LIKE TO WATCH THE EXTENDED VERSION, IT HAPPENS THAT I BOUGHT THE THEATRICAL VERSION AND THEN I WAS NOT ABLE TO BY THE EXTENDED BECAUSE IT WAS A LOT OF MONEY TO SPEND. IAM NOW ON BLUE RAY DISC AND I AM NOT GOING TO BUY A CHEAP VERSION OF IT."
1,What an insult....,"Come on New Line! How insulting can you be? First we get theatrical versions of the DVD and have to wait and spend more money to buy extended versions of LOTR which should have been available in the first place. Now it looks like you're going to do the same thing again? The backlash has already begun. Those of us that are true fans of not only LOTR but Blu-Ray as the preferred choice of media will not go along quietly with this release. Why don't you just do right by the fans the FIRST time around..... don't turn into the ""Star Wars"" franchise!!! BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! For the love of God, Peter, PLEASE put your foot down and demand that this be done right!"
1,"Great Movie, Silly Marketing",It's pretty silly to expect people to buy this version when the extended version was released several years ago.
1,Consumer Choice,"The fact is people may prefer the theatrical release over the extended edition. However, the cynic in me thinks that staggering the release of the two different versions on Blu Ray was an intentional strategy to sell more items to unsuspecting consumers. Beware."
1,*sigh*,"I've never written a review before but I had to show my support at fully agreeing with the one star ratings for this product (NOT the films).I have never seen any LOTR but I had decided I wanted to pick this up on Blu Ray and indulge in what I had been putting off for a long time. As EAGER as I am to jump on this, I realize this Blu Ray release is only the theatrical release and only to gouge our eyes later on the extended release. I'd rather pay twice the price for the uncut extended than pay for this and left wanting the full experience later. Please support by reviewing this product with one star."
1,LOT! blu-ray is another trick,"another trick from Peter Jackson & New Line to make more $$$$$$$, so please don't buy this stuff twice,please wait for the extended editions."
1,Hurry the **** up with the extended editions !!!,This is ridiculous just release it in extended...From the overwhelming majority of reviews it's what we clearly want. Keep giving this tripe a one star people as it's TOTAL RUBBISH to have an inferior product available because studios wish to screw people!!!
1,enough already,"I agree with others on here. I bought the theatrical version on DVD. Why release only this version on Blu-ray, when they could include both versions on the disc? Because they want to sell you the exteneded cut later. Blu-ray discs can hold a wicked amount of information. Don't let them take your money over and over again. The movie is 5 stars. This pick-pocket style of Blu-ray release is 1 star."
1,Rip Off,One billion dollars and they are still as greedy as ever. Peter Jackson must have learned the art from Master Lucas. Bad form!!!
1,No thanks to the theatrical editions.,"Disgusting that this Blu-ray boxed set is being packaged with only the theatrical versions of these films after every fan that would even consider buying these films AGAIN has already been spoiled by the extended editions of these films, which should have been shown in theaters originally in the first place. I know run-on sentance. Anyway don't throw away your money folks, just be patient."
1,I don't buy until the extended versions are available on BD. Period.,"Do you hear us, New Line. 1,000 plus people (and each of us represents some 10,000 others who feel the same way) who say, ""Are you joking?""George Lucas tried the same thing--- over and over and over. He lost millions of loyal fans. Millions! Don't make the same mistake, Peter."
1,Dont hurt the fans...,We are big fans of the Lord of Rings. We have the extended versions. I dont understand why both versions can not be on the Blu-ray Disks. We want both movies in the same set. We shouldn't have to pay for both separately.
1,Taking Your Money,They are releasing the Theatrical versions to get your money again come the inevitable release of the extended versions. Wait it out if you want to get the true Lord of the Rings experience on Blu Ray.. The DVDs still look good especially if you have a 360/Ps3/etc to watch it on.
1,Total rip off....,I will wait for the extended movies just like i did when they came out of the theatre. Just another greedy corporation milking us for all we are worth.
1,The audacity of these guys,How greedy do there Jokers have to be. In an economy like this they are still scrounging for everybody's money. I am definitely waiting for extended release.
1,This disk seems to be missing something,"Honestly, don't make folks buy the disk twice to get the theatrical review and the director's cut."
1,"I""m with the other one-star reviews","I give the movies 5 huge stars, BUT I agree with the other reviewers--come out with the extended versions at the same time, so that we can choose which to watch. In this set of movies in particular, the extended versions are so well crafted and integrated that they belong on my blue ray player!!!!!Three cheers for the movies!!Giant raspberry for the poor choice of marketing!!!"
1,Don't buy this Theatrical Version People!!!,"Movie = Epic, Legendary, Awsome & Award Winning.That said, New Line releasing a theatrical version in Blu ray of LOTR is just plain insulting. I really hope people wouldn't be buying this version so new line can feel the pain. How does that saying goes...""Fool Me Once Shame On You!, Fool Me Twice Shame On Me"". Maybe if they sell it for $10 then I might think twice. Again, PEOPLE PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS VERSION."
1,Love the movie! The REAL movie!!!,"As many others have said here, I too will be waiting for the extended edition. In the wise words of Eric Cartman: Suck my balls, Warner Home Video!"
1,Wait For Extended...,Don't do it. Wait two months after the theatrical releases and you will see the announcement for the extended editions.
1,Entended rage,Just another review asking the powers that be to release the blue ray extended version!!
1,Extended Release,"Yep, I fell for these tricks a few times before back when DVD sales were becoming a large part of the marketing plan for movie studios. A common trick would be to release a more complete version of a movie after sales of the ""vanilla"" DVD started to drop off. This would encourage fans to spend their money yet again on a more comprehwensive package. LotR did this as well on their initial DVD releases.Now that this fantastic film is ready to hit Blu-Ray, New Line Cinema is releasing the Theatrical Version only to start things off. Well, most LotR fans know that the extended version is the far superior version and will undoubtedly be released on Blu-Ray. It's too bad that the studio could not release both versions in the same package which is why this gets only one star."
1,Don't be a sucker,"Don't be a sucker, wait for the extended version. If enough people boycott this then the extended will arrive quicker."
1,"Shame on you, NLC....","....how much more blatant can it get, that NLC is ONLY after our hard earned money on this one. It's really a shame and puts a shadow over the whole, otherewise undoubtedly fantastic, production.DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION !!!!"
1,There's plenty of room!,"Warner! There's plenty of room on a Blu-Ray for the Extended editions, why cheap out like this? Oh, right, greed.If you had even bothered to do *any* market research you'd find that the same demographic that has adopted the BD format are the same ones who will skip the cheap-O edition and wait for the Extended editions."
1,Rip Off,Another 1-star reviewer and LOTR fan. This is ludicrous. I'll be waiting this one out for the extended edition blu ray release.
1,That Weak Sauce! (LOTR Not extended),First we have to wait years for LOTR on Blu-Ray now they are playing their old trick with theater release and extended release. I know you want really much to have that movie because I sure do but don't waste your money until they release the extended edition.
3,very good presentation ... but no sub-titles in the first cd,"muy buena presentacion... pero no sub-titulos en el primer cd.soy de latino america y aunque conozco el idioma ingles, en mi opinion la primera pelicula deberia de tener todas las caracteristicas completas...very good presentation ... but no sub-titles in the first cd.I am of latin america and although I know the English language, in my opinion the first movie should have all the characteristics of complete ..."
1,A total waste of time and money,I do not recommend anyone to buy this product. It's the studio's ploy to rip us ( the paying customers ) off again. Buy the extended version which is already available in the market.
1,"Time are tough, stop double dipping","With today's economical woes, you are still willing to screw over people out of their hard earned money? Boo to New Line. Just boo."
1,Do Not Buy This!,Ok. Ill just say I love these movies. But I was one who waited for the Extended version to come out before I bought them. I did not double dip on the dvd sets and I wont do it for the Blu Ray either. If New Line would go ahead and release the Extended Cut on Blu Ray at the same time then Id highly recommend buying it. But do not let them dupe you into buying the theatrical cut unless your just not into the extended versions. Those of us who really enjoy the full story will wait and make New Line see we wont be bought out. Anyway avoid this and maybe New Line will give us what we really want.
1,They've got some Nerve,"Don't buy this, it's not the whole movie. They will release the whole movie at a later time. Wait for the one that says Extended Edition."
1,NOT A SUCKER THIS TIME !!!,Sorry people... I won't get suckered again!!! I'm waiting for the Extended version BluRay to come out. This theatrical version is for the birds. DON'T GET FOOLED PEOPLE. Be patient and wait for the Extended Version.
1,and in the darkness bind them,"like everyone else, not binding me. I'll either wait the 2 years for the extended or wait for some retailer to heavily discount these theatricals even if I do break. I spent way too much collecting them in various DVD formats to do that again on BluRay. Oooh heavily discounted Star Trek BluRays! Ill buy those first and bide my time."
1,I too will wait.,"I will just have to wait for the extended editions. There is only one reason they can't release them now, money. I love Lord of the rings! I have a beautiful set that I will watch again soon, and then when the Blu-Ray extended set releases we will watch them again anew."
1,Rip off,They should have released both Theatrical Editions and extended at the same time. This upset me the first time around and never did buy the extended and I will not buy this until they come out with both. We can send a message to the studio.
5,A must own for any serious LOTR fan,The extra footage is amazing and well worth the additional cost over the theatrical release DVD's. If you're a serious LOTR fan you absolutely need this box set!
1,No Thank You! Too Lazy for Flipping Discs Over in the Middle of Movies,"Not sure if I'm the only one that noticed, only had time to read a few of the reviews here, but these movies are placed on an inferior quality disc not capable of holding even the Theatrical version on just one side, and therefor must be flipped over while you're sitting comfortably on your couch, snuggled in for a night of movies. Unless you have a multi-dvd loader, and two copies, you're getting off your lazy butt mid-way through to flip these discs. Have fun with that. I'll wait for the Blu-Ray version of this set."
1,Lame,"Brilliant. Make the diehard LotR fans wait even longer for the extended cut... If this wasn't a cheap marketing ploy, they would release both at the same time. Add my name to the boycott list. =PI guess I'll have to wait until 2012....of course by that time there will probably be something better than Blu-ray and we'll have to go through this all again. JOY!"
1,No reason for the theatrical version!!!!!!!,New Line is playing with their customers; or they just want to make money off you!!! The extended version is the one the true fans are waiting for: and we shouldn't wait that long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Ridiculous,"I'm sick of movies having all these ""editions"". Buy the super special directors edition now. But in 6 months re-buy it in mega uncut extended special edition?? Ah, no. If you want my $70 give me all the footage or no sale!"
1,Total Rip Off,Making a review to add my disgust with this rip off. I am just agreeing with the majority of reviewers. Do not let them get away with this.
1,Fool me once,"Nope, not going to do it again. If New Line wants to attempt to make money by releasing both versions separately, be my guest. But I will not buy this version."
1,Waiting Game,"Love the series, own the extended edition on DVD, and own a blu-ray player. I would LOVE to own LOTR on blu-ray but I'm not stupid enough to buy the theatrical version."
1,Lord of the Rip-Offs,I don't mind spending more on a complete version but I totally agree why should the public get the corporate shaft with multiple versions in Blu-Ray? NOT. They made enough money off me on the numerous DVD versions. JUST SAY NO to this Blu-Ray multiple version trickery. We won't get fooled again.
1,"enough is enough , we want the extended cut !!!!","extended cut and only the extended cut is worth buying , if the theatrical release comes with that , i dont mind , but spending money on this version is just not reasonable , especially when some of us own more than 2 editions in standard dvd format !!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Lord of the Rings Trilogy,I had a very good service during my firt buy with Amazon.Interesting experience.
1,Booo!!! Extended Edition FTW!,"I have loved this series more then any other movie, and i'm sure it will always be my favorite movie. That being said, I was also one of those people duped into buying the movie twice. Theatrical is such a rip off! Sure they ""Needed time"" to clean up the scenes and put them in the movie for the extended sure... but Blu-ray come on! They should give you the most complete LotR movie ever! It should include the Theatrical version, sure, maybe even some commentary about why they cut out certain scenes. This is ridiculous though if they think i'm going to spend my money on something that I know will be sold in what I really want 2 years from now. *anger* It's like buying Harry Potter year 1-5, why the hell wouldn't you wait until you can get 1-7 on blu ray?"
1,Disgraceful,"LoTR fans are some of the most dedicated/devoted on the planet. As one of the book and movie die-hards, I have purchased the trilogy twice now on DVD: first, as part of the theatrical release and again for the extended editions. Asking us to purchase them TWO MORE TIMES just to make a buck is a slap in the face. Raise the price a bit, if you're really feeling greedy, but for the love of all things holy give us both versions on ONE BLU-RAY please. Because, if it doesn't have both versions, I (and many, many others) will simply not fork out the money; so this will end up being a losing proposition."
1,Don't give them the satisfaction.,"Trust me, everyone's pockets have already been lined sufficiently with the LOTR franchise. I personally own all 3 dvd's, and then all 3 extendeds, and I saw each movie probably twice in the theatres. What is that, like $200 personally to New Line?Don't give them the satisfaction of purchasing this set. Vote with your dollars to get the extended released"
1,Filthy Movie Studios! We Hates Them!,"Stupid executiveses wants money, only money, cheats customers! We hates them! Give us the precious extended versions!"
1,Please cancel this release. Give us the extended version.,"Please cancel this release. Give us the extended version on Blu-ray instead. It is a waste of your time and our time to keep waiting. I am not buying this version, and so are millions of fans of this great trilogy.I will wait until the day Amazon realize they have an over-stocked supply of this release sitting in their warehouse; and lower the price to maybe $10 bucks. Then I may consider it. Just maybe."
1,Waste of money!,"Come on New Line & WB? What the heck is wrong with you? Can't you just release the EXTENDED version of LOTR Triology? I doubt anyone will fall for this trick you guys keep doing on major releases. SAVE YOUR MONEY EVERYONE, WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED RELEASE!!!"
1,Useless Release.,"Why bother releasing. I was a victim of the first LOTR release dvd vs extended. So I bought it twice so I could have extended. This time, I am the one doing the back-stabbing. :)"
1,Waste of time an money,"Sincerely, the guys that worked to produce this Blu Ray title wasted their time. The extended edition is really what the movies should have been, filling in much needed pieces that didn't make it to the theaters (for whatever reason).Don't waste your money on this title, and support petitions to bring the extended editions to Blu Ray. I'm sure New Line is watching, and I'm sure they thought they would be smart to wait until the Hobbit is out to release everything together (2012+)"
1,the more the merrier...,"I can't add anything, but want to help make sure the message gets across. My DVD player does a fine job upsampling the SD disks, and I can hold out until the extended editions are released on BD."
1,RIP-OFF!!!,"Who in their right mind would buy the theatrical version on Bluray?!?!?!... and why on earth would 7 bluray discs be required? Perhaps these New Line fools are unawar of the capacity of a bluray disc... or perhaps New Line will probably just copy it over from the DVDS. No effort and maximum profit. GREED, just plain greed! It is an absolute joke and I'm certainly not going to be taken for a ride with this one. Wait for the extended version with over 2 hours more film enjoyment."
1,"Come on guys, really?","What a monumental step backwards and a really ill-conceived money-making ploy. I might Netflix these, but maybe not even that."
1,Voting for EXTENDED edition,"I really hate how they milk their fans.Thanks for the alternate link A.T. Mahr, I'll put it to good use."
1,wait,"Will wait for the extended. I do not know why they can show movies in 1080p on satellite and euro cable, but they cannot on US cable. Also, if there exists an HD source with DTS audio, then release it ON BLURAY already!"
1,The Internets have spoken! Say NO to price gouging!,"I really want these movie on Blu-Ray, but I want BOTH versions. In this day and age that is more than possible: It's expected. Go back from whence you came. Dark sales tactics will not avail you! YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"
1,Displeased,Enough of the same old money grubbing crap. Give us the REAL product. I am a huge LOTR fan and I REFUSE to purchase this in blu ray without the extended options available on the already spectacular DVD's. When will they ever learn?
1,Refuse to be duped into a double dip,"Both versions of this movie should be available from day one. I totally understand holding off releasing Blurays of the trilogy until 2011's Hobbit release and 10 year anniversary, but releasing this misleading incomplete theatrical-only cut now is simply a cynical cash-in."
1,A big rip off,"This release of the movies is totally unnecessary. There is no reason not to release both the theatrical and extended versions of the movies in one complete set. If you buy this product you will be sorry when a new set is released with all the versions of the movies. Even if you do not want the extended versions you should wait and see if they release them together, you have nothing to loose buy waiting to see what the studio will do in the future, just rent these if you really NEED to see LOTR on blu-ray."
1,Really?,"I'm not about to plunk down another $70ish dollars towards a half-step; just release the full versions already! Until then, my money stays in my wallet..."
1,Awesome Movies but bad product.,This is truly a money scam. By not doing a double version release (theatrical and extended editions) they are trying to force the fans and consumers to buy this theatrical version since it is the only blu-ray version available. Then as soon as sales on this version fade off they will re-release the extended editions on blu-ray to get everyone to buy the movies again. It is highly recommended that you wait to purchase LotR on blu-ray when the Extended Editions are available.
1,No more money from me.. dont they have enough???,"Well well well,Just another lame-a** attempt to get money out of the general public. They make millions already, and it STILL isn't enough!Jokes on them, as I will NOT be buying either copy this time around. Nope, I'll torrent what I want. No more will my hard earned money go to these leeches!"
1,"FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU; FOOL ME TWICE, SHAME ON ME!","""Pay, I say, pay attention boy!'""Ya built too low, the fast ones go over your head, you keep missin um!""I say son, what's the gimick, what's it all about?"""
1,Save your Money,Another ploy to steal your money by releasing ONLY the theatrical versions. If you don't want studios to keep stealing your money...then stop falling for thier ploys....wait for the extended versions which will definitly have the theatrical versions included...all good things to those who wait...and you get to teach the studios a lesson.Don't buy this set wait for the set that you really want.
1,No more double dipping!,"I've got to get on the bandwagon here. Pay attention New Line, we don't appreciate this. We're holding out for the proper editions, and I think you'll find this will sell poorly. Send them a message people, no more double dipping!"
1,Total Rip-off Without A Doubt,"No fault of Amazon but this is a total rip-off by the makers.As many, many have said on lots of reviews across the world, on the net and in other forms of media - WAIT for the fuller versions.For crying out loud, there is LOADS of space for both versions to be incorporated to this Blu-ray disc but no, ""lets rip-off the public as much as we can"" is the attitude of the makers.Its a disgraceful action on behalf of the film company to allow this to be released.Sadly, some will still buy this rip-off - but a true fan will have better sense and wait.AVOID NOW - and get the fuller version later."
1,Noooooooooo!!! Wait for extended edition,New Line - you are not going to rip me of again. Release the Extended Edition now. What are you waiting for.
1,"Do NOT, I say, waste your money.....","I will join the thousands out there in saying this.................we will not bother to buy the short edition blu-rays of LOTR (UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND EXTRA MONEY AND COLLECT THIS BOXED SET) I won't mind waiting months or even a year for the extended editions to come out, blu-rays are generally expensive and I myself personally only buy the ones that are worth it. Now since there is no release date for this title yet, maybe New Line will change it's mind and include the extended version, but if not I for one will not be buying."
1,Theatrical release is worthless,Why would they release the theatrical version when the extended cuts are far superior. I don't know they would waste their time and money on giving us this lesser version and to be honest I don't know why I would waste my time and money either.From what I hear the studio wants to wait until The Hobbit comes out to let us own the LOTR trilogy on Blu-Ray in the extended cut. Poor decision!!!
4,Inspired me to read the books and visit New Zealand,"I think this is a good series for kids to watch, but adults may find the acting to be overly maudlin and the plot sometimes drags. There are some spectacular views of New Zealand, and some of the scenes are interesting...but I found I was seeing the actors as actors, not as the personages they were meant to portray. However, it did inspire me to read the books, which I am sure will be better."
4,Great deal and fast shipping,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy tends to be quite pricey so I was very happy to find such a good deal online! I received the dvds and they seemed to be in good order and just as described. They played very well but there was one spot in the third dvd (the return of the king) that I had to skip because it was messed up. It didn't seem to improve much even after cleaning... So, I'm giving this 4 stars."
1,Lord of the Rings Trilogy,"It is a terrible copy of the LOTR Trilogy...it does not work! We bought it as a gift and the recipient that we gave it to was not able to view any of the DVD's no sounds, no pictures nothing...but we cannot return it at all..the time has expired we are out over $100. bucks and we will NOT buy from Amazon ever again. We will go to Best Buy from now on. It sucks that we cannot get our money back nor exchange the defective item. Buyer beware plus they charge you shipping back and re-stocking fee...."
1,BLUE RAY IS LAME PERIOD.,BLUE RAY IS SO LAME.NO MATTER WHATS DONE WITH IT.I PEFER STANDARD DVDS BETTER.BLUE RAY IS MORE PRONE TO BREAKING.
5,"Yes, the movie studios are trying to get money","So is EVERYONE in America. If you want to wait for the Extended Edition to hit Blu-Ray, then WAIT. Maybe some of us are happy with the theatrical release in Blu-Ray."
4,Ripoff!!!,"This isn't any more than what we all already have! This is only the 3 movies Extended, as 2 have already been released! And, who hasn't bought them already!? I, along with many others have purchased the Extended Gift Set's with the good stuff! And, even those who didn't still purchased the Extended movies! But...if for some reason, someone hasn't been purchasing each one...this is pretty good, although nothing really special is new here! You still have to get up halfway through the movie and switch DVDs! This isn't even High Definition! You already have the movies...if not, burn them...wait 2 years for this Extended Trilogy to be released on Blu-Ray disc in its true High Definition glory and put in one disc per movie!"
1,the rambo trilogy was better than this mess!!,i would watch santa clause conqures the martians over this!!!kong is jacksons only good movie!
1,What a rip off...,I cant believe that the movie industry again wants to rip off all those ppl who have anyway waited far too long for the LOTR blu-ray buy just releasing a theatrical editon.. Dont buy this product and show them what the customers really want!
1,"Disappointed In Product, not film quality",Very disappointing we are not getting the extended cuts of the films in this package. I will not buy this product.
1,"Sad, Sad, Sad",It's one thing to sink our money into the DVD releases but to do it again with Blu-ray? Nope. I will wait for the extended Blu-ray editions since I will not put down that much money again and again. The Best Buy exclusive tin is nice though...
1,Utter BS,"This is unacceptable. Please please don't give in to these people and buy this. Even if you only desire the Theatrical edition, please wait till the other one comes out. Their sales need to take a hard hit before they realize they cannot screw the customers over and over again. Please do NOT buy. They take us for fools every time."
1,LOTR BD - Theatrical ???!?,"I agree with everyone who has given this release one star -- this is nothing but blantant, insulting greed perpetrated on the public by the studio.I wouldn't take these for free -- seriously, I wouldn't. Once you've seen the extended versions, going back to the theatrical is like seeing a movie on TV, cut to pieces to fit a time slot. Not happening."
3,All things come but not all ends well,"I also purchased both versions when they were released on DVD. I prefer the extended version and see no reason why both versions could not have distributed simultaneously instead of the Theatrical only. That being said, I did purchase the Special Edition blu-ray for no other reason than to have it as a collectors set. Am I happy with the blu-ray quality?No, it frankly is as quality a copy as that I have in the extended DVD when upconverted. Some scenes are grainy and have poor contrast, while other scenes are amazingly clear. Unless you see that there will not be a huge number of the Collectors version extant and find one, I would avoid purchasing this version utterly. Wait for the Extended Version in blu ray and hopefully all of the scenes will be remastered instead of what appears to be just a blu-ray copy of the first DVD set."
1,Disgracefull and blatantly greedy marketing. Don't buy,I agree 1000% that buying this theatrical release is a bad idea and will only encourage this sort of marketing from the publishers.Extended release for these titles scheduled for 2011 2012!?! Why so long? So that they can get us now and then get us again later.Makes me want to boycot these titles altogether.
1,Booooo!,"Has George Lucas taken over Newline? Come on Newline, you know we all want extended. Your double, triple or quadruple dipping titles is coming back to haunt you."
1,Skip it...Gonna have to wait for the extended edtion,"The the price of Blu-ray, i'm going to have to wait to the Extended Edition. Can't afford to double dip"
1,Extended and Theatrical Together or not at all!,I am sick of dealing with these huge corporate movie companies ruining the Trilogy by trying to make a little extra money! God nows that this Blu ray set is going to make bank! The only reason they won't give the fans what they want and put the Extended Version and the Theatrical Version together in one set in the first place is because NEw Line and now Warner Brothers are greedy! They treat Peter Jackson like DIRT and then go crawling back to him. Now Warner Bros. and New Line are starting to treat the fans like dirt. The Trilogy will not be ruined through this infamy! This ends now!
1,"Boo, New Line","Agree with all who've written --- the beauty of Blu-ray is suppose to be how much content can be put on a single disc. First off, Give us BOTH versions (theatrical and extendend) + all of the bonus content from before + additional stuff we haven't seen, including stuff to get us excited about The Hobbit... put it on 3 Blu-ray discs at most. We don't need 7 discs and you know it, studios. One 50GB disc per movie is fine! It's all about the illusion of value with you guys. Just more discs to get scratched if you ask me."
2,It doesn't have Spanish subtitles like it says it has,I was very disappointed to find out that the package I bought didn't have Spanish subtitles like it says it has. I bought them for my parents so they could watch them too. It should actually say that instead of Spanish subtitles it has French subtitles like it's described at the back of the box. They should change the description of this product; they are deceiving the buyer thinking what they show is what they sell. It was a rip off.
1,This is not a definitive edition,I personally prefer the theatrical editions because of the extended editions lengths. But there is no point to not have both in this set. They will probably release the extended edition later and make a lot of money. But people should protest and not buy this until New Line makes a more definitive edition of LOTR.
1,Love the movies - hate buying them twice!,"The LotR trilogy was a big risk. So many people know and love these books - vast in scope and how could it possibly live up to our collective expectations? Somehow they met and exceeded them. True, the theatrical version were quite long - for watching in the theatre so I understand cutting some of the extended scenes even though the extended versions add so much. Watching the movie at home IS different. You can take a break if you need to. I loved the movies and so like many I bought the theatrical and extended versions of the DVDs but I will only buy the extended Blu-Ray and encourage everyone who loves these movies to do the same. Send a message to the studios that you want them to ADD value to earn your business with the highest quality of BOTH the theatrical AND extended versions as well as a digital version you can take with you. Let them know we the consumer have choices now (some, unfortunately net them no profit at all). Vote with your dollars!"
1,Half of what I already own twice on DVD.,"I'm so sick of getting screwed on these re-releases. It's no wonder people pirate movies of the internet when you have studios insulting your intelligence on a regular basis. A very wise man once told me, ""You can shear a sheep over and over again, but you can only skin him once...""I will buy worth while releases over and over again. But if you expect me to replace the 2 DVD trilogies I've already bought with this half-baked garbage, just to turn around and release the extended editions.... well, then you should at least buy me breakfast the next morning."
1,Waiting -- along with about everyone else,"Nothing new to add. Frustrated like everyone, that the scheme to get you to buy this, and then buy the extended version that is better loved, is being repeated once again."
2,Lord of Rings trilogy on Blu Ray Delayed,"[...]New Line/Warner has delayed 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy' originally slated to hit Blu-ray this November.The 7-disc set scheduled for November 3 has been removed from the slate and will now be released sometime in 2010 (likely in the Spring).Warner has not provided any reasons for the delay, however there is some speculation that the studio doesn't want the title to ""get lost in the crowd"" from their other high profile releases according to reports from The Digital Bits.Bummer."
1,Wait for the extended. This isn't worth it.,Hopefully New Line will realize that this is not the best way to keep customers happy.
1,Not this time...,No thanks New Line. I am not going to own 4 copies of the same movie. They can drag the EE Blu Rays to the next century for all I care. I'll be sticking with the DVD version.
1,Really??? Like I'm really gonna waste my money....,"This is ridiculous. Who really wants this when the extended versions are the clear winners over the theatrical versions?This is purely a case of suicidal greed and I hope it fails as a release. I will, however, be buying the extended version on blu-ray once it is released.So, you'll get the sale, when you offer the right product. Thank you :-)"
1,Don't be a sucker . . .,". . . and order the ""theatrical version"" that has been obsoleted by the extended version.Please do not support a poor trick on consumers and fans."
5,The greatest fantasy story ever told...?,"It is probably very unnecessary for me to add my review of The Lord of the Rings, however, it is not often that a treasured fantasy book such as this, becomes a worthwhile film. If you allow yourself to get caught in this story, it really is a fascinating world that Tolkien has created. I never thought I'd see a film that would be a worthy translation of the book, but nonetheless, Peter Jackson and company have done so. Sure, there were some things left out from the book that I would have liked to have seen in the films, but regardless, they did a fantastic job. If you would like to lose yourself in Middle-Earth, take the time to read the books and watch these films. But before you do, introduce yourself to Middle Earth by reading the Hobbit. Its a fantastic journey!"
2,"Way, way too much credit given to this trilogy","The Lord of the Rings trilogy is okay and that is about it. The first movie, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was so painful to watch because it was so long. The story seemed to take forever to get going. I can't imagine it having an extra 30 minutes added. The second installment, ""The Two Towers"" is better. There is a more moving plot and some comedy is added. The third, ""Return of the King"" is definetly the best story. Was it worth best picture? I would say no. Some of the awards it did win were justified however.Off hand, the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Godfather, Back to the Future and Beverly Hills Cop trilogy, just to name a few, are much better than the Lord of the Rings. Even the Harry Potter series, which has 3 movies out at the present time, is far more entertaining. If the movies would have been trimmed, it may be a better set. I would recommend this movie to someone who really, really loves mid-evil things, and has A LOT of time on their hands!"
1,Widescreen only??,"I think for this price, amazon could at least offer this in full screen. Their are a lot of people, that like myself, hate widescreen format!!"
1,These movies were just awful....,"Sincerely, what a bunch of nonsense. Halflings and wizards. Malarchy.There is only one trilogy, and Star Wars is its name."
1,I have to agree,"I generally don't support this type of review. But since I bought the theatrical and extended versions of the standard DVDs, it's not like I'm reviewing something I've never seen.Fortunately, people have become wise to these marketing ploys over the years. I hope sales of this theatrical version are low.To the person that is happy they released the theatrical version because the extended versions are too long, I would ask why do you suppose they didn't release both allowing the consumer to choose? Better yet, why not optionally play the extended versions from the same DVD?"
1,Disappointed,I am very disappointed to see Warner Bros. Double Dipping on this release. I will not have it! I'm not gonna buy this!
1,Extended or Nothing,"It is nonsense that we have to wait for the extended release on blu-ray. I will not buy this product, I'm waiting for the extended versions on blu-ray."
1,RIDICULOUS,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy should be released with both theatrical and extended included already. It is RIDICULOUS that they are trying to get over AGAIN like they did with the DVD and I agree with most critics....DO NOT buy this version but wait for the extended version...I would not be suprised if they come up with a ""special extended version""."
1,Theatrical version only? Seriously??,Releasing this in just the theatrical version only is a purely financial decision by a greedy studio. I will not buy this until the Extended Edition is released on blu-ray.
1,newline cinema...lord of MY ring......,"Im with everyone else here. completely tired of getting ripped off again and again.. so..the theatrical version only BDs can sit in the bin with the LOTRs lunchboxes, paperweights, bookends and pantyliners...I can wait. Ive waited this long. unbelieveable isnt it???? do not buy this BD. hold out for the real deal extended version BDs..."
1,Shameful!,"As per the above reviews, this is not the Extended edition. Don't buy it.It's a rip off...loud and clear."
1,"Waste of time, WAIT WAIT WAIT!",I remember being sp excited to purchase the original DVD release and the first thing advertised on the DVD was a commercial for the coming-soon extended versions. What a disappointment!I'll just wait for this release to pass!
1,"DO NOT BUY, WAIT for EXTENDED RELEASE",This is the theatrical release NOT the extended version. Wait for the extended. Don't let the studio make you repurchase later to get what you really want.
1,Corporate greed,"More money, more money, for a few. How sad these corporate types are in charge of art. This is what happens when corporations own art."
1,The Studio Can Bite Me!,Can you say rip off? Well that is what you get with this release. Wait for the Extended version and keep the one star reviews coming until the studio barfs it up.
1,money ! money,"Commercial ! sortir la version cinéma et dans 6 mois les versions longues c'est se moquer des Clients que nous sommes, c'est décider malgré l'envie de voir ces 3 films en BR je n'achéterai pas, version longue ou rien..."
1,GREED of the Rings,How many times do they expect us to pay for this?!This should come free with an extended version!!!
1,WAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I'll wait for the Extended Blu-Ray also.I bought the regular and then the extended DVDs so I'm hooked, but I will NOT buy the regular Blu-rays!WAIT!!!"
1,Wait until they release the extended edition,"As a couple thousand other people have mentioned, this is not the extended edition so it's a waste of money. Wait for the extended edition to be released on bluray."
1,"Wasn't fooled the first time, won't be the second time either","I didn't fall for the buy the theatrical release then like a sucker buy the extended version later on. I won't this time either. Studios, you won't be suckering me into buying the same movie twice to get ALL the content that should have been released the first time."
1,studio ripoff,"Why buy this wen you can get the ""Extended"" versions down the line.....shame on the studio"
5,LOTR rocks!,"This is one of the most action-packed, exciting trilogies I've seen. As a kid I appreciate both the serious and the light-hearted moments. Having read the books I was afraid that the movie wouldn't measure up, but Peter Jackson and the cast did a phenomenal job.This is a movie I will show to my kids one day."
1,Blu-Ray Review,"Have extended on standard, why would I buy anything less? Will wait for extended. Also, learned my lesson about double dipping with standard dvd's. In no way will I do it with blu-ray."
1,Thank You...,"Thank you for all the reviews about this movie. I wanted to buy this when I saw it on TV but I'm glad I didn't. I have all the extended DVD's and the extras. I was thinking this was made into Blu-ray. Only reviews can tell the entire story and because of them, I did not waste my money..."
1,I will not purchase this edition !,"Waiting for the extended edition on blu-ray. I will not purchase this edition, just like I didn't buy the theatricals on regular dvd."
1,Where is the extended cut? It is far superior,"While Fellowship of the Ring was great as released, both the Two Towers and Return of the King had noticable flaws and gaps that were well remedied by the extended release.Why on earth is the blue ray release of this trilogy of the theatrical, rather than extended edition? The extended edition exists. The technology to put it on blue ray disc exists. There is no excuse for not release the extended edition on blue ray except to try to rip off consumers with double dipping.Wait for the extended edition for your blue ray selection!"
1,"I'm not made of money, guys.","I've had it with movie studios releasing movies, which everyone runs out to buy because it's the only version of the film available, and then the studio almost immediately releases the better version that everyone wanted in the first place.You double-dipping c*********s. Knock it off."
1,Agree with the majority,"Great movie, ""But don't get fooled again."" I am with the others wait for the extended versions."
1,Shouldn't even be one star!,"If you want the short version look up that ""how it should have ended"" on youtube. Stop anyone you know from buying this half hearted production and demand the extended, truer version."
1,Helping The Boycott Vote,"Studios PLEASE listen to us the customer and stop trying to make us Double Dip. Work on a great transfer. Stop coming out with multiple versions of the same film over and over just to squeeze money from the fans pockets. Since New Line/ Warner Bros already has the Extended Cuts in their possesion why not release those first?The Extended Cuts were so much more entertaining and complete. I will, as will so many others, wait for those versions before I buy.Stop the Double Dip Greed."
1,A Disappointment to Rule Them All,"I have to say that I share the general sentiments of many others--with a film series that has such a solid fan base, it deserves the best treatment on Blu-ray. While I did enjoy the theatrical cuts, the extended editions of the movies definitely expanded the universe and added a great deal of depth. I suppose, along with many other disappointed fans, I will hold onto my money and wait for the extended editions. As for New Line and the many other companies who follow suit in producing useless edition after useless edition, listen to your customers. Stop releasing half-hearted products and give the fans what they want."
1,"no extended version, just another vote","Yup, thanks for the reviews. When this showed up on the sidebar of my amazon page, I was thiSClose to ordering it on the fly, but the reviews saved me.Again, thanks for pointing out the flaw."
1,Theatrical edition.... come on...,"I was so excited when I saw the LotR on blu ray, then I saw theatrical edition... NOT EXTENDED... come on... the extended versions are the definitive versions. No one wants the theatrical. GIVE US THE PROPER EXTENDED VERSIONS. I will buy the extended blu ray editions the second they are released. Until then I'd rather watch my DVDs."
3,"Great Movie, but why not the extended versions","There is no need saying that the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy is an awesome movie. I just don't understand.. If Peter Jackson can put the Theatrical and Directors cut of King Kong on 1 blu-ray, why couldn't he put the Theatrical and Extended versions of Lord of the Rings on 3??"
1,Screwjacks at Warner Bros. Tryin to Steal Our Precious!,"I cannot add anything new to how specious and ridiculous New Line Cinema and their parent company Warner Bros. have been with the release of the LotR trilogy for Blu-ray that hasn't already been said, but I can say that I will not be making this purchase this time around. I'd rather save my money, the ""precious"" amount I have, and buy the EXTENDED EDITION when it comes out, whether that will include the theatrical versions or not I honestly do not care, because quite frankly who wants to see less of LotR? Certainly not me and neither should you. I want to see all that Peter Jackson has to offer, and if that means two-hundred and some minutes of pure fantastical entertainment then so be it."
2,extended edition please,"In agreement with many of the posters here. I want the extended edition on blu-ray. I would even pay a bit more for it (if it were available).. It's good to see people giving this a bad rating, maybe somebody will get the idea....."
1,no more double dipping,"BE warned, these are the theatrical editions of these movies.Today, paramount announced the Star Trek original movies on blu-ray and yes, they too are the theatrical edition only. This is because they are 'working' on the extended editions for later release. The same enhanced and cleaned up editions that have been on DVD for two years are somehow not ready for blu-ray.And now, the LOTR movies that were enhanced, cleaned up, and extended for HD cable TV broadcast a few years ago are suddenly not clean enough or ready for blu-ray and will come later.ENOUGH ENOUGH ENOUGH!"
1,Not Again!,I can't believe they trying to double dip again. Do they thin they can get away with it? Don't by this Blue Ray edition. Wait until the extended version comes out. You know it will. Shame on them!
1,wrong one,What can I say that hasn't been said. Wait for the extended edition. I made the mistake once on the original release. I will not make it again.
1,extended addition!!! NOOOT!,I was so excited when I saw they were finally releasing LOTR on Blu-ray now I am just bummed that it is not the extended addition!!!
1,Disappointed- Extended Edition Delayed,"Not too much to tell here- this is simply a double dip. WB really should have released the Extended Edition on Blu Ray. I have no doubt the product will be a phenominal BD. Unfortunately this is a case of the studios realizing that people will pay two, three, and four times for the same product."
1,Are this guys from New Line Cinema idiots?,"So, they take years to publish LOTR in Bluray, and yet they want to sell us the theatrical version?I hope they dont sell a single copy and they have to use it to warm their rears in the cold winter....They just are treating us like if we were a joke.We want extended edition! if you are going to sell us theatrical you better be ready to see red numbers.does this give you guys any clues of what people want?2,197 Reviews5 star: (148)4 star: (15)3 star: (36)2 star: (30)1 star: (1,968)if you dont understand it, go get an abacus, because im sure you foes don't have a brain big enough to handle a calculator...."
1,We need the Theatrical and the Extended Versions of this Awesome Trilogy,I agree with the statements from other reviews where it says that the Studio needs to release the Theatrical and the Extended Versions on Blue-ray NOW.
1,Wait for the REAL version you want,"No need to say the same things other reviewers have said - all the ""1 star"" reviews have already said it.But - notice also that the ""specs"" for these versions say they have DTS-HD High Resolution audio. That is NOT the best possible soundtrack (it is not a lossless format). So that is 1 more reason to wait for the ""real"" set of LOTR you want which is inevitable. Only DTS-HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD offer lossless audio for movie soundtracks (of course you have to have the equipment to make use of these high-res audio formats - and that probably means at a minimum a receiver with HDMI audio/video inputs). So there are TWO reasons not to get this set: the extended version option is NOT included, and the soundtracks are not lossless audio. No doubt both of those shortcomings will be addressed in the subsequent Blu-ray release which is INEVITABLE - just have patience."
1,Greatest Fantasy Movie of all Time or Greatest Rip-off?,"Now let's see. I buy these Blu-ray ""Theater"" versions now, then in a few months ""The Director's Cut"" and then six months or so later, ""The Full Extended Version"" will be released. Neatly tripling profits as was done with the first DVDs. I don't think I am going to fall for it again."
1,One edition to rule them all,"How can they give us 9 Blu-Ray discs (that's potentially 450gb of data!) and not give the extended version. Wow - well, as others have said - stay away until the real version - extended directors cut is released.Greed is all consuming - Hey does anyone think they meant to do this to see if we can resist the temptation of The Ring? Naaaa - they just want the extra cash..."
1,Greedy little pigs,"It does not surprise me that New Line put out the theatrical version first in a money-grabbing scheme as they are a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, who switched allegiance from HD-DVD to Blu Ray right after the Christmas holidays so Xmas sales of their Harry Potter box sets and other HD-DVDs wouldn't suffer. These studio attempts to bilk the public have turned me off to buying DVDs and Blu Rays. I only rent now, and have no problem with people who turn the tables and download pirated movies. You reap what you sow.The shame is that it has been over 6 years since The Return of the King was released. The extended version should have been made available on Blu Ray long ago, but now the purported excuse is to release it when The Hobbit is released to theaters. You can count on another box set to come out later that will include both LOTR and The Hobbit.Greedy little pigs."
1,New Line should be ashamed for holding extended edition hostage again!,"Terrible decision...just tick off your fans, why don't you. Both versions should be on one Blu Ray...you'll take my money again with some super-fantastic definitive collection on Blu-Ray. I'll wait for that."
1,WE WANT THE EXTENDED EDITIONS!!!!!!!,This is complete and total BS. I'm not buying it until the extended versions are available.
1,They are being so obvious,The studio's greed is so intensely obvious only a turkey might not notice it. 1 star all the way until they release the extended version and honestly even if they did this ploy will make me take at least one star off the extended.
2,this is very unfair!,people! dont buy the theatrical versions...of course there great(its lord of the rings)! but when you experience the extended versions the story is broader..more details and even new characters!THE LORD OF THE RINGS are my favorite films and trust me the extended versions are INCREDIBLE AND WAY EPIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
1,Fool me once...,"I fell for this theatrical-version trick when the first movie came out for the first time on DVD. To say I was pissed off when I discovered their scam is an understatement. I will NEVER fall for it again. Don't these morons realize that Blu-ray people are usually real movie fans?Studio hacks: Put this edition back under the rock you crawled out from under, then let me know if you ever decide to release the REAL version.Oh, and one more thing: If you think you're going to rip me off for a huge Blu-ray premium, (some Blu-rays are as much as 70% over their DVD counterparts!), forget it. I understand there is R&D; to recover, but anything over a 25% premium is just a plain rip-off. If you choose to try to extort more than that, I'll keep my money, and you can keep your discs."
1,Give us a break New Line,"You have already reaped the benefit of these movies. It's time to give the fans, and paying customers, what we want. (5 stars for the movie, by the way, 1 star for New Line)"
1,Not my money!,"Include me with those who will not support New Line in trying to double-dip by releasing the theatrical version two years before the extended version. Face it, we all know that the extended version is far superior, so I will join with the others in agreeing not to buy the theatrical version. Release the version we all want and we'll buy it. In the meantime, I'll watch the DVDs."
1,I'll just wait......,"Sorry, english is not my language, so I'll just silently join an angry mob and wait for extended edition."
1,We want the EXTENDED version! Not spending my $ on this version!!!,"Come on New Line & WB? What the heck is wrong with you? Can't you just release the EXTENDED version of LOTR Triology? I doubt anyone will fall for this trick you guys keep doing on major releases. SAVE YOUR MONEY EVERYONE, WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED RELEASE!!!"
1,This is great,I've seen releases like this before and this is why people download movies instead of buying them. Juicing our wallets. People keep posting sarcastic remarks and starting verbal riots! They won't get away with this!
1,Zero Star,"I would rate it zero star if it's possible, it sure is a rip-off. The studios very well know that the consumer is willing to pay for the Blu-Ray version then why are they not doing it for the extended release unless they are planning to add another atleast say 10 minutes of movie to all the three individually and then also the theatrical version release is just bogus."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Warner Bros is at it again, releasing an inferior product so you have to double dip later. There is no reason to release the theatrical version instead of the extended except for to take more of your money."
1,WILL NOT BUY!!,Not releasing the extended version is a slap in the face to all the fans. I watched the movie multiple times in the theatre. I bought both the regular and extended DVD. Enough is enough! There is no way I will buy this.
1,Don't waste your time or $$,"Those of us who care enough re-buy this item on Blu-ray hopefully know to wait for the extended edition of the trilogy. If you don't care, you should! You don't know what you're missing out on."
1,Do not buy this version. Wait for the extended versions!!!,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. DO NOT GIVE NEW LINE ANY MORE REASONS TO DOUBLE DIP US THE CONSUMERS.
1,Not Happy,"I want to watch this version but I dont want to also buy the extended versions, that I want to watch also. I will buy one set. It seems to me that there will most likely be a menu to see the the theatrical version with the extended verson....soo I will wait. Shame New Line."
4,Love this story,Every time I watch this movie I fall in love with the story over and over again. This is a great edition.
1,I'm not buying this movie twice.,It's not that I feel entitled to an extended edition or anything... they just shouldn't feel entitled to a 5-star rating for a product that they're trying to get everyone to buy twice.
1,No extended footage,"This is retarded, along with anybody who would buy the non-extended version. Save your money."
1,Thanks for the Rip Off,Nice job in dragging this out even further. I'll wait for the extended version thank you very much.
1,I'll keep waiting...,"Sorry, I really love this movies, but I'll keep waiting for the extended editions, many of you are right, they could have throw one package with everything in there... so I'll wait."
1,ripoff,"W/ 1080p bluray, you really don't need bluray discs anyway. You can't even tell the difference between a bluray disc and a standard disc AFTER a blueray player upscales a standard disc. Too, LOTR should only put released on the EXTENDED edition. Anything less is a ripoff!"
1,Excellent movie. Greedy release.,"Rather than add to the numerous complaints please let me point you to the release that you should buy instead, the extended edition on blue-ray.The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Extended Editions) [Blu-ray]If you must have all releases, wait until the extended edition is released. The theatrical edition will drop in price significantly by then. I, for example, gave away my extended edition on DVD and repurchased the set in gift box version with additional footage, concert, and figurines for twenty-dollars each--don't be surprised to find a blue-ray gift set with additional content.In the mean time, enjoy the DVDs with an upscaling player. Cheers."
1,Last Bastille against greedy movie companies,"A little story:I just recieved a golden ring. I put it on my finger and suddenly a red, greedy eye appeared. And a deep voice told me to by some BlueRays of ""Lord of the rings"" (the movie versions only).It was this moment, when I realized I had to take a journey to amazon and strike this evil with my keyboard and mouse.Take this WARNER !"
1,And then they wonder...,why piracy is so rampant in their industry. greedy aholes. what goes around comes around.+1 who will not be supporting this disgusting corporate behavior.
1,Argggg!! Theatrical edition!? This really make LOTR look so bad!,"Theatrical Edition?! I have both theatrical and extended version on DVD and I can tell you the theatrical version is as good as in the trash bin. I'll rather stick to the extended version on DVD, it aren't so bad playing on a blu-ray player with upscale.And I would give this zero star if I could."
1,Do not buy.,This is my vote for a boycott of greed and indifference. I waited 3 years for the movies to be released. I think everyone can make due with dvd for now. The true fans probably have both versions including the box set which will suffice until the extended versions are released.
1,"We need to stick together, don't buy this item!!!!",All of us LOTR fans need to stick together and NOT buy the blu ray theatrical release. Wait for the extended version. Shame on New Line.
1,Extended Version please,"I ad my voice to the chorus. I will not buy this until the extended version comes to blueray. I didn't fall for it the first time, and I will not fall for it this time."
1,What a con - we aren't stupid,"New line must honestly believe that we are completely stupid. After all, who would want to buy this knowing that the extended version must be on the way? And what excuse would New Line have for not giving us the two versions right now?Just plain profiteering.Don't buy this. Screw them."
1,Will *NEVER* Buy Theatrical Version in Blu-Ray!,I will *NEVER* buy this version. Only the EXTENDED cut will do. It's simply greed on the part of the producers.
1,Milkin us dry!!!,Why are you trying to take advantage of the loyal fanbase that LOTR has produced???Release both the theatrical and extended versions at the same time. That's the way to reward the millions of fans who have made you rich!
1,Extended Editions + Theatrical Editions >>> Theatrical Edition,"Wow...the movies have been out for what, over 6 years now? Come on, it's just plain greedy to release the theatrical editions on blu-ray when everyone knows there are extended editions. Please give us theatrical editions + extended editions + more extras when you finally release LOTR on blu-ray."
1,Disappointed Fan,"I am a huge fan of the movies, but totally agree with the idea that we are being ripped off. I will buy the blu-ray when the extended trilogy is released. Until then, the upconverted DVD's of the extended versions are just fine."
1,Do you take us all for fools??,"It's at least insulting to release the theatrcal version and anounce the release of the extended for sometime in the following years...Any decent studio would have the courtesy not to rip of its public like that.You can very easily release them both together, or make an edition in which the viewer can select which version he/she wants each time he views it!After this kind of treatment do you think its a wonder that many people resort to illegaly obtaining a large part of their music or movies collection???Respect your clients and they will respect you back!!"
1,Shameful,"Excellent Movie. However, this is another shameful marketing attempt to fool fans of this great series into filling the studio's already enormous sack of money for a third time. We all want The Lord Of The Rings on Blu-Ray but it's an outrage that they're only going to release the theatrical versions of the movie and probably wait for it to sell an incredible amount of copies before releasing the extended versions. Do not fall for this marketing scheme and wait for them to come to their senses and decide to actually please the consumer this time by releasing the extended and theatrical versions on Blu-ray at the same time or in the same package."
1,Why No Extended Edition?!?,"So here it is again: WB is trying to double dip with the Blu-ray versions of Lord of the Rings just like they did with the DVD releases. I agree with most of the reviewers here on Amazon that it is disgraceful for this studio to try to make more millions off the same scheme instead of giving us both the theatrical version and the extended cuts and letting the buyers decide which to buy. I was even more upset when I saw that THE STUDIO DOES NOT PLAN TO RELEASE THE EXTENDED CUTS ON BLU-RAY UNTIL LATE 2011 OR EVEN 2012!!!! Its time studios stopped being greedy and did something good for the consumers!NOTE: As others have said, I am NOT giving a bad review of the LOTR trilogy. It is one of the finest produced set of films I have ever seen. I even decided to rent the theatrical versions on Blu-ray and they do look FANTASTIC (something I suggest you do if you cannot wait to see them in Blu). But I refuse to spend $50 on WB's scheme to make me pay twice."
1,money grubbing fail!,"The money grubbers trying to rip me off by providing the theatrical edition, instead of the extended edition, go just forget it. I won't be fooled again.Wait for the theatrical edition.Don't waste your money!"
1,Dont get fooled...,"Image quality is the same as on DVD Theatrical version...In pre-order said that a bunch of subtitles options were available, now, it only has two languages.Don't buy it if you have the DVD, same stuff, but more expensive."
1,Add me to the list...,"It's all been said already...love LOTR, but will wait for the extended editions. The DVD transfer is top-notch, and will suffice until then."
1,Don't buy this edition.,The studio could get my money when they offer the extended.I'm sick and tired of buying movies in different formats and in different editions.
1,Here we go again!,First question I had when I saw this product now available ...I wa...yet againnted the extended version and not waste my money again...thanks for writing your reviews and alerting us!
1,It's all about the money,"My argument is the same as everyone else's...they're releasing this to make millions and then going to release the extended edition at a later time. According to an interview by Peter Jackson I saw a few month ago about the Hobbit, he said that the extended edition was a definate for blu-ray and it would probably be released before Christmas of 2010. So i'm pretty frustrated as to why they don't just release them both at the same time and charge more for the extended edition."
1,"Sorry New Line,not this time","I fell for this ""ONCE"" with the first DVD version of the first movie. Not this time. I also found it quite ballsy of Mr Jackson in the last chapter of the extras of the first movie to mention all the extras he would put into the directors cut. Nooo,not this time. I will wait.No stars to whom ever made this decision."
1,Say no to greed,"I don't have anything to add to the hundreds that have preced me, but hopefully New Line might see the financial light (though I doubt it). I won't buy these because I prefer the extended editions, which will inevitably be released on Blu-ray, and see no reason to buy these twice once again (as I did on DVD). While that is a sufficient reason in itself not to purchase, the blatantly cynical intent of New Line to double dip on this title is disgusting."
1,This made me sad,"Seriously? Why? With the Extended Versions out there who would want the regular editions? The movies are so much better with the extended scenes. This is just an act of greed cause New Line knows that people are going to rush out to buy this and then when they release the Extended Versions, people will rush out again to get them. Well I will be one of those who will be waiting.You've really saddened a lot of people with this scam."
1,Don't pay twice!!!,It's one thing to release a theatrical cut of a movie and then work on an extended edition that is released later. Yes I paid twice. I had no idea there would be an extended edition.But why release theatrical version again when the extended editions are universally preferred and already exist???????The only explanation is the studio has some sort of misconception that everyone who bought theatrical and extended cuts the first time will do it again.Not a chance. There's already an extended edition.I'M NOT GOING TO WATCH THE THEATRICAL EDITION IN BLU-RAY WHEN I ALREADY OWN THE EXTENDED EDITION IN ON REGULAR DVD.GIVE ME THE EXTENDED EDITION ON DVD.AMAZON SHOULD REFUSE TO CARRY THIS.
1,Theatrical cut only? No Way!!,"Don't buy this set, it is only the theatrical cut! Come on New Line, there is no excuse for separate editions this time. As soon as the extended editions are available I'll be ordering it, but not this set."
1,New Line Rewards LOTR Fans with a Dissapointing Blu-Ray Relesase,"Like most of the reviews at Amazon.com. The best way to stop this kind of double dipping is simply not to buy this version. It cost the studio money to make the discs, if we don't buy it they will lose money and learn not to screw the fans."
1,Still waiting for Extended version...,"Well, just like hundreds of other reviewers here, I will veto this release entirely and wait for the extended version on Blu-Ray. There is no reason apart from pure greed for not releasing the Extended version also or even in one bundle of Theatrical/Extended.I will support the boycott of this release!Come on NewLine, how much more bloody money do you want to make on this?Sign-up for the Extended version instead of buying this one!"
1,Hope no one gets fooled,"The time frame I see on Amazon at the time of writing is ""Apr 6 2010"" for theatrical and ""2011 or 2012"" for extended. Nice try! I hope no one is stupid enough to pay for this version and regret later when they release the extended. People need to show the studio that they are not idiots, so please don't waste money on this. You could just rent this on blockbuster or netflix if you really want to watch it on bluray once."
1,A solemn pass on a long-awaited release,This is an unfortunate release as any fan or otherwise will want the extended releases as their first and only Bluray of this great trilogy. Obvious money-grab and a real low-blow to fans and casual consumers alike.
1,Pointless release,"In all seriousness, Warner Bros. have lost the plot.They should either release both films together in one deluxe box set (the size of BR disks would easily allow for this), or just the Extended versions with branching technology, NOT this mess of a release.No purchase from me."
1,Release Extended Editions NOW!,"Please read the product information carefully. These are the theatrical editions, NOT the extended editions. Again we as dedicated fans are going to spend way too much money because we can not wait to get our hands on blu-ray discs of LOTR. But we have to wait another two years in order to get the Extended Editions. Sound Familiar. This is a crime. Please look over the reviews and mark all one star reviews as helpful and perhaps make your own one star review. Perhaps we will be able to make the studio realize that we are tired of being duped out of our money."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! PATIENCE.,Save you money for the extended version. I can't stand companies who do this. I never bought the extended version. I'll just wait until it's on bluray and then RENT IT!!!
1,Waiting for the EXT Edition,"Another fan that is going to wait for the Extended Blu Rays to come out. Come on New Line, you can do better than this."
1,LOTR LITE,A terrible decision to release this version. Hopefully they will learn a lesson when thousands of these discs are sitting on the shelf unsold when the extended edition is released in blu-ray.
1,Shadin,"As has been stated, this is just a double-dipping attempt from New Line to get people to purchase this set, then the Extended edition when they release it later. It's a shame they're being so blatant about it, but hopefully this version sells poorly and they rethink treating their fans this way in the future.Save your money and just wait for the Extended version release."
1,Wait.,Wait for the extended release. This one is just the studios casting their nets for extra money.
1,Pure rip-off!!! Don't buy!,I totally agree with the other reviewers that this is pure rip-off. I don't want to pay for something 3 times... I already did buy the DVD pack now i need the blu ray but only if it is the complete extended version. Also i read that the quality of the transfer is way below what is to be expected of this edition (ref. High Def Digest recent review).I hope the studios will finally quit this let's rush it and just release it scenario.Don't buy this!p.s. The movie is awesome but this PRODUCT is NOT!
1,Boooo Theatrical Versions!,"Can't believe they're doing this AGAIN! Theatrical versions first and then a few months later the ""real"" (extended) versions. Why does the movie industry have to be so f-ing evil all the time? Money Money Money.Please everyone, show your disgust and do not buy the chopped up theatrical versions."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,WARNING!!!!!!!!! WARNING!!!!!!!!!! WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WAIT FOR THE EXTENDED VERSION OF THE 3 FILMS ON BLU-RAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE EXTENDED VERSION TRILOGY ON BLU-RAY WILL COME OUT RIGHT AFTER THIS CRAPPY STANDARD VERSION IS RELEASED!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT BE A SUCKER AND WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LET'S ALL SHOW THESE MONEY HUNGRY FILM COMPANIES KNOW WE ARE SUCKERS NO MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!VOTE YES IF YOU AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT.THANK YOU ALL!
1,No Extended Cut = No Purchase,"Without the extended cuts, this set is a complete waste of money. Why would they even think this was a good idea to release. Save your money and wait for the extended cut that is sure to be released at some point."
1,"5 Star Film, 1 Star product","Reviewing this product, I consider all facets of the purchase. This is a 5 star film released by greedy greedy men trying to get more cash out of me! I saw the movie in theaters a dozen of times...each. I have theatrical version for each on DVD, and extended, for each, on DVD. Now they want to trick me into buying all that over again? They won't release the extended until this 1 star product finishes selling. Lets finish sales early and not purchase this blatant waste of money. Bababooey!"
1,I agree! WE WANT EXTENDED VERSIONS!!!!!!,"With 357 one star reviews and counting, I don't need to say much. Why on earth would anyone who has seen the extended versions want the theatrical versions? Why even release the theatricals except to make money? They could even give the option of choosing extended or theatrical on the individual discs. A lot of movies have that. Come on we've all been waiting for a long time already.BTW, this is my first ""complaining"" review and I think it's totally justified."
2,Lord of the Rings Bluray,"This non-sense is getting old. Meter it out to the public in bite-size form to extend the profits. When will we learn this tactic on this set of movies. And Digital copies are a sham, I've never had one work for me. I'm avoiding them in the future. Enjoy, just know your being taken advantage of....again."
1,Where is the extended edition?,"The extended edition is already finalized and just needs to be converted to Blu-Ray...just as is this theatrical version. So where is it? Why is it not coming out at the same time??? Hell, I wouldn't even care if I had to pay a couple dollars more for it (over the theatrical version)...but ONLY if it were coming out at the same time. Instead, they are just being money hungry and I'm not buying into it. Hell, I never bought the DVD version just because I have been waiting for the full-length Blu-ray version for years now! I can wait you out even longer. :) You're not getting my hard earned money that easily..."
1,A-greed...,What a surprise! Hollywood execs want to bleed us dry squeezing out every penny they can before they play this one out.There is no justification whatsoever for releasing this other than greed. The discs could contain both versions with little effort.
1,wow... Theatrical Edition? Really?,"Im not wasting my money on this crap, sorry, been waiting forever for them to release this on Blu-ray only to be foiled by theatrical edition, give us a break and stop being idiots Newline."
1,Another Extended Vote,"What the heck are these people thinking? They are going to LOSE money on this release. Why did we wait for 4 years after the first movie came out to buy the extended version of it on DVD. Now with the popularity of BR, why wouldn't we wait for it now?"
2,An attempt to boost revenue ?,"It had been assumed that the HD version of the films wouldn't be released, until ""The Hobbit"" was produced and in the theaters, so that the greatest amount of buyer-excitement was generated...The 'early' release of the theatrical versions, may just be an attempt to generate revenue during the slowdown in the economy... (anyone know what New Line's fiscal report looked like for the past year ?"
1,Who do they think they're fooling?,"I refuse to give my money twice to the movie studio that came up with this fiasco. I've watched the extended version of each of the LOTR movies and I will not waste my money buying the theatrical versions. So get on with it, people at the movie studio! You're going to waste your money selling this version and nobody who appreciates the LOTR series will buy it. I guarantee it!"
1,Manipulation of your fans is bad business...,"New Line is perfectly capable of releasing the full extended editions of this incredible series, but choosing to squeeze as much money out of your fans during a recession is an egregious abuse of marketing power."
1,WAIT FOR EXTENDED VERSION!,"This isn't the one you want! $70 for the THEATRICAL release??? Puhleeze, give me that sweet extended version on bluray. Waiting patiently for the extended version.... That's what we got the Blu-ray player for man!"
1,Won't be buying this,"As with everyone else, I won't be purchasing this product. Why? Because there's no reason for Newline to be holding out and not giving it's customers what they want. Maybe someone at Newline will take notice but what are the odds? Pretty slim I'm sure. Anyways, I would advise anyone looking at this to steer clear and wait for the extended cuts on Bluray."
1,Will not buy,"I'm holding out for the extended editions. Sorry Warner, I can live with TNT a little while longer."
1,Waste of money...,"You will not get my money New Line. I have already the EE DVD version, and it still worths the 40$ I've paid for.What is new in this cheap blu-ray package ? Nothing! Even the features will be on SD format. What a skinflints!!"
1,fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me.,B.S. to these. Release the extended editions you jerks. This product is absurd. They want to rip you off yet again. Wait for the extended editions.
