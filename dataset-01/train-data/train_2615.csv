2,Poorly Written,"This book is not written clearly. The equations are not described adequately and logical steps in the solution descriptions are missing. I teach physical science and wanted to brush up for the Physics CSET exam. Even I, an educated person with a masters degree, could not follow the logic outlined in this text. The author attempts to teach you how to solve physics problems, but there are no practice problems to test your understanding in the book. I don't recommend this book to anyone...especially dummies ;)"
2,Good if you just want a general idea.,I bought this book to help me with my college physics class. If you are considering the same do not buy this book.The book explains very little regarding the full complexities that come up in a physics class. It will teach you all the easy stuff without giving details that you will need to complete a true college level course. In other words it's like reading the first few paragraphs of each chapter in your text book and leaving the rest out. So if you just want to know what physics is about then this is a good read I guess. As a supplement to your studies it fails miserably.
4,PHYSICS FOR DUMMIES,"I FOUND THIS TO BE A REALLY VALUABLE QUICK REFERENCE TO USE WHEN TRYING TOEXPLAIN SOME OF THE MORE COMPLEX CONCEPTS FOUND IN FLUID MECHANICS.THE MATH IS KEPT TO A MINIMUM, BUT PRIOR MATH EXPOSURE IS MOST HELPFUL.I DID NOTICE SOME CONFUSION IN CHAPTER TWO (2) WHERE AN EXPLANATION TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS IS GIVEN, THIS IS A MINOR THING BUT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS TO THE UNFAMILAR STUDENT.ALL IN ALL THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK AND I RECOMEND IT TO ALL."
2,not a study guide,"I dont think of this book as a study guide for those in a physics class, be it high school or college level. It explains some concepts only, and doesnt have a variety of practice problems that you can work on for each chapter. It also doesnt go deep into each chapter, just sort of skims the surface. It's ok for those that just want to know a bit about physics, but is surprisingly unhelpful (b/c it is very unlike the ""for dummies"" books ive read before) for students."
4,thumping good story,"I liked it all the way. They did not shy away from the interracial aspect of the couple at all. I learned a heck of a lot about another culture. I really liked the characters, they were people I wanted to know. The mystery element was just right. But I wanted them to touch each other more, I wanted more physical love between them. The one love scene they had was quite endearing and gentle. Now I want more :-)"
5,An excellent modern Native American romance,"I have been an admirer of Aimee Thurlo's books for years. She knows her Native American history and lore. In Redhawk's Heart she ably demonstarates that white and Native clutres can indeed mix and fall in love.Along with an excellent knowledge of Native customs, the author offers us an excellent mystery set in the wilds of the Navajo Nation.It's a book I found hard to put down. If you like a good mystery or an excellent source of Native American customs - or both! yoou'll enjoy Redhawk's Heart."
5,Chicago's Best Blues,"Nothing like Live Blues!These guys deliver it with power, and they all come to play like no others can. Howard's vocals are a perfect match for every song and yes, he's churning out that fantastic bass too. Every member of the band is top notch, but my favorite has to be Dan Bellini's harp playing on ""I Got My Mojo Workin'""! Dan plays great guitar too but his harmonica takes the music to a completely new level! Get your mojo working and buy this disk!"
5,Excellent instrumentals,"When I first bought a CD player a few years back, Ghost and Other Great Hits by Spectrum was one of the first 5 CD's I bought. It has remained one of favorite's over the years.Spectrum does a wonderful job turning some good songs (mostly vocal) into flowing instrumentals."
5,A Must Have for A Celtic Rock Fan,This CD really shows the best of a truly believable and dedicated Celtic Rock group. This band plays their heart out on this CD. This is a must have for your music library. The diversity and incredible sound on this CD will make it one of your favorites - it's in my player as the default CD!
1,Flawed - Not fit for purpose,"This mandoline suffers from significant design flaws. Since the main blade sits flat across the product (instead of at an angle like many others), it takes a lot of force to cut harder vegetables like carrots or potatoes. To make matters worse, the blades aren't at all sharp in the first place. Cutting fries or dicing vegetables doesn't really work because the secondary perpendicular blades aren't quite long enough to cut fully through each slice of vegetable.Avoid this product."
1,Dont waste your money,"This product can only slice butter. Ripped tomatoes instead of slicing. Could not handle carrots.I don't think you would be able to cut your finger with these blades.Save your money or spend a little extra on professional slicer.Fortunately seller refunded money, but i still got charged for shipping."
2,"For the collector, only.","Grainy, flickery, black and white SILENTS. Only ""Little Red..."" has sound. More useful to the collector, than someone after entertainment."
5,Peril's Gate - One of the Best,"Peril's Gate is a wonderful addition to the Wars of Light and Shadow series. It is the continuation of a great story line not unlike the works of Tolkien or Frank Herbert. The characters continue to develop with a depth not normally seen in fantasy literature today. The plot line is intricate, well paced, and exciting enough to keep you on the edge of your reading chair. It is a book that you will want to have in your library so you can read it again and again. I can't wait for the next book in the series."
4,Wurts creates a beautiful tapestry of land and characters,"What I like about Janny Wurts's writing is how beautifully textured and rich the world and characters are. While I wouldn't recommend starting with this book, I would highly recommend starting with Curse of the Mistwraith, the first book in The Wars of Light and Shadow. Wurts creates characters who grow, make mistakes, change, and sometimes do amazing things. Arithon, the hero, draws readers in from the first book. I also like that the world of Athera is itself almost a character in the book. The characters affect the land and the land affects the characters. I can never predict where Wurts will take her characters next; I do know that I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the next."
1,The Plot needs more Development,"Janny Wurts really should stick or confine her stories to a a trilogy or a set of 4 books max. Geez,she can really drag on a story. I used to be a fan of her books, but her latest series is realyl disappointing. The plot of each book minus all the prose can be written in a few pages. In fact, the pace of the story is soo crawlingly slow that it just makes me want to scream. This series could certainly do with more story/plot development. At present, the story seems to be stuck in a loop of Arithon running to some new place and Lysaer chasing after him, again and again."
2,"Enough, already","Janny Wurts can really write. And overwrite. Not to mention italicizeanditalicizeanditalicize yet again. I've read all of her books, and enjoyed this one least of all.200 pages less, and Peril's Gate would be a fine book. Mayhap she's lost the ending?"
4,football fun,I was pretty excited to give this to my boys but I also wanted to paint one of the teams to be the vikings. That took a couple weeks but it is done. Then the viking lost the NFC championship and i lost all passion for painting the other team to be the colts. Anyhow we added some details. I made a bunch of cards and some rules and now we have a game. Last weekend the boys had some fun with it. We will give it a whirl again this weekend probably. Nice simple toy and as I have set up they can learn many things about the rules of the game.
2,Little Football Guys,"My son loves football, he likes to use his action figures to play an imaginary game of football. I gave him the Football Guys for Christmas. He played with it Christmas Day, and a couple days after. He hasn't played with it since. I thought it would have been enjoyable for him."
3,"Good Content, Poor Photo Reproduction","The book's detailed content on the operations and controls of the X-15 is quite good. The book is from the early 1960's and contains mostly text and line drawings. The quality of most pages is adequate (legible). While some photographs in the book are OK, 13 at the back are of very poor quality. They appear to have been photocopied multiple times and have no gray values. (In fairness, the Amazon Book Description hints at less than perfect quality: ""This affordable black and white facsimile has been reformatted. Care has been taken however to preserve the integrity of the text."") Too bad that an original copy was not available to the publishers."
2,NOT for Beginners,"The title of this book is misleading. It is definitely NOT written for beginners. The book is geared towards those familiar with homeopathic jargon and is a very difficult read. I was hoping to learn the basics of homeopathy with this book, but was very disappointed."
2,A satire that grows implausible and disappointing,"The narrator comes off as a likeable rogue spewing the kind of self help you can even see on PBS, but after consuming a heady brew of cough syrup and drugs, he has a vision and goes off the deep end, taking the book with him as he sinks."
1,"Title a misnomer . . . great concept, but doesn't deliver.","I agree wholeheartedly with the Oakland, Pittsburgh, and St. Paul 1 & 2 star raters below. Glad I checked this out of the library before buying it. It went back well before the due date.I was excited when I read the review for this book. I anticipated a book chock full of photo references from 35,000 feet to help decipher the view below. Instead, what's presented is a bunch of satellite photos that have absolutely no relevance to the perspective one has from a plane.While there is a lot of good information for the geography buff, I'm rating this only one star because it clearly doesn't deliver what the title suggests.And kudos to the King County Library System for quickly acquiring many copies of new releases, allowing me to try before I buy without waiting months."
2,waste of money,"I had such high hopes for this book, as I'm an avid window-seat landscape watcher, and am always wishing there was some way to find out more about what we were flying over. This book has a great concept, is nicely packaged (Chronicle always does a great job) but the ""window seat"" offered must be from the Space Shuttle. The book is illustrated only with Landsat photographs, unnaturally colored, from such a distance above the earth that it has no connection to the landscape we see at 35,000 feet. So disappointing! And so unusable as a flyer. And the text seems written for a 12-year old. The list of things you might see in any given terrain are never overlaid on the landscape images, so its wasted as a 'key'. Sorry, but I'm off to try to resell this to Powell's."
2,Grounded,"I ordered this book with soaring expectations. Only recently, I had flown over a meandering waterway and wondered what it was. When I read about this book in the Wall Stree Journal, I ordered it, hoping that it would answer that question as well as others. However, other than some really neat satellite images of some of my favorite destination, this book seems little more than a short geography text book. I'm afraid it's not worth the money and perhaps next time I travel I will order an FAA sectional to take along."
1,Take this with you on your next Shuttle flight!,Duh! Guess I didn't read the reviews! My bad. Aerial shots these are not! Only astronauts could use this book with its satellite shots. A colossal CHEAT!
2,Not that great,"Just not as detailed as I would like, and I probably will not use it much. Covered too broad a spectrum."
4,Helps flights go faster.....,"I'm not going to touch on the aerial/satellite issue, as that's already been covered. It is a clever idea for a book, educational and fun, and when flying over major land formations like the Grand Canyon, it is useful. Since our snacks, movies, free drinks, etc have been taken away, looking out the window is just about the best entertainment left on a plane, and this book helps take advantage of that."
4,Good Book,"Anyone on a plane should be looking out the window. A nervous passenger, the passing sights have been my one flying pleasure. This book does a good job of not only capturing the essence of what can be seen from the air, but describes the basic building blocks of our continent and how out society has developed on it and affected it. I wish the format was a little bigger, but it will fit in a seat pocket as published."
1,I am Giuliani...before me there was only darkness...,"This is the gospel according to Rudolf Giuliani, the former prosecutor who, as mayor, encouraged the New York City law enforcement community to believe it could do anything it wanted and get away with it. Diallo, Louima - - those are only the best known victims of a culture of repression that was part and parcel of the Giuliani administration. He may or may not have made the city a safer place to be. He unquestionably made it a less tolerant one.This is Giuliani's official biography, and without 9/11, it would have been viewed a good deal less positively. Remember that Rudy was around a long time before 9/11 - - and the results were decidedly mixed."
1,A self proclaimed hero,It's sad how politicians become heroes during tragic times. 911 glorified Giuliani and made him an hero whose rating was plunging south. Although he deserve for his efforts in bring down the crime but it was the strong economy boom in the 90's that was more of a factor.He does not deserve to be called a Leader. Anyone in his place would have done the same. Rather the hard working New Yorker including the Firefighters/Police men who deserve to be called True Leader.
5,Best spinach I ever tasted,"This doesn't work too well as a novel of manners, but it's the best source of Vitamin K you can get for the money."
4,Smart Leadership Insights,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book -- plenty of unusual (how he got rid of aggressive panhandlers masquerading as car windshield washers!) and insightful (why you should stand up to bullies, how he used computers to stop crime) lessons for both business leaders and public policy types. His excellent leadership post-9/11 aside (textbook crisis management), Giuliani deserves the credit for making NYC a livable city again (the drop in crime rates are staggering) and he shares a host of stories which I found relevant to my own business. Minimal gossip and lots of straightforward storytelling. Not a difficult read, either."
5,O U T S T A N D I N G ! !,"I found this book riveting. I am not much of a reader, I used to follow the Dangerfield see it in a movie in less time theory, but I am currently on my second reading of this book. I simply could not put it down the first time. Excellent insight to the behind the scenes workings of New York. No one could imagine how to handle an incident like 9/11 but Giuliani was prepared long before 9/11. Excellent ideas for leading a company or your own life. I Highly recommend this book."
4,A-,"Very good book, does a great job of providing insight into Rudy's style/methods of management & accountability. One star lost because it can be a little dry at times. Anyone who is a fan of Rudy Giuliani should have this book."
1,Giuliani ... big time!,"Awful text and words. I cant understand how his publisher let him wrote this book. He does not have a clue on how internal politics or Leadership is done and the only thing he has taken advantage of is his Sept. 11 actions, wich in my opinion he did not make anything out of the extraordinary."
1,Why Giuliani isn't a great leader,"Giuliani isn't a great leader because he exploits things to his benefits. For one he exploits religion and art. Does anyone remember the Brooklyn controversy when Giuliani denounced ""The Holy Virgin"" as anti-Catholic for his senatorial advantage. Well its great that he has an opinon except, he never bothered to see the exhibit, ""Sensation."" And by the way he calls himself Mayor of America and on what grounds? He's anti everything that isn't Giuliani"
1,UGH....croak........,"you people don't actually STill think this thing is a ""hero"" do you? oink, oink...he's ganna teach anyone about morals...what a joke...and all of you that still fall prey to his falasies...and fantacies.one star because zero seems to be missing here. BIG zero."
4,Very good,"I got this book out of the library. I liked it so much I bought 2 copies. One is for me, the other for my daughter."
3,Good Examples of Time Honored Leadership Principles,"As a New Yorker I read this book because I really loved what Rudy did for the city. His courage really lifted the whole city. I was riveted by his account of the moments after the first plane struck one of the World Trade Center towers.As far as leadership goes, Rudy uses examples of his administration to illustrate his point. Having read plenty of leadership books I can say that while all of Rudy's points are solid, he doesn't tread on any new ground.Still, I would recommend this to anyone interested in learning how to deal with the administration of a big city like NY."
5,Excellent Book,"A complete course in leadership and management! Rudy, run for president! You have my vote."
5,True Leader,"Amazing to see how this man changed New York City into the greatest place on earth. He's a true genious and inspiration! Great reading, I read it in 2 days. I couldn't put it down."
5,Giuliani stood up when the towers fell...,Forget about politics. Forget about extreme Muslims. Forgot about Republican or Democrat. Forget about Giuliani's personal life. Just forget about it.This book is about the defining moments of 9/11 and the leadership it needed in order not to descend into chaos. This man has put his heart and soul into this event and showed great leadership you can learn from.The writings in 'Leadership' give you great insight into the situation of the event and dealings of the mayor. Courage as well as leadership prevail in keeping the objective of his mission close. Information is critical when chaos is lurking around the corner. Sleep can be denied.Being European I'm not biassed in my judgement of the person or politician Giuliani. When you read this book about mayor Giuliani there's a lot you can learn from.
4,Great lessons to lead by...Repetitious in some chapters,"I read this book because I was doing a speech on leaders in one of my classes. I enjoyed his lessons that he presented in each chapter. I knew this would be good because he led NYC out of 9/11 which earned him Time's Man Of The Year for his leadership.Here are some of the lessons that he describes throughout the book so that you have an idea of what to expect.First Things FirstPrepare RelentlesslyBe Your Own ManReflect, Then DecideStudy. Read. Learn IndependentlyThose are a few of the chapter titles. These lessons are almost generic, but he does a good job of explaining how he uses them each day. Everyone has there own ways to lead, but Giuliani will go down as one of the greatest for his effort on 9/11. Other than it being by Giuliani there are not any new lessons to learn on leadership. You will just see the ones that he uses to lead."
4,Good? Yes... But maybe a bit self-congratulating!,"I've read this book before, the result of a random purchase, but bought it again as in different continent (cheaper than getting sent from home) for a university assignment...Without any other knowledge on what happened during Rudi Giuliani's term as New York City Mayor, this book provides a pretty good read and insight into the practical application of what stands as really solid techniques to good management and leadership. Worth the read in that respect.However, with alternative knowledge on what happened during his term, especially his handling of 9/11 (prior and during), this book ignores serious errors of judgement on his part which really undermine all of what Giuliani talks about.Yes, get all the small details right - those that affect how your staff relate to you in good times; but also make sure of getting the big things right - those you will be remembered for in your legacy.A good book, but don't take what's written as absolute gospel."
1,Self-Promotional Aggrandizing,"In my book, a genuine and great leader has absolutely no need to write a book on leadership.Leadership is demonstrated, not talked about."
1,egotistical journy,"I did find New York mayor Giuliani's daily modus operandi interesting. However, it is a pity that one has to endure his burly egotism in the book. I got half way and called it a day."
2,this is not a leadership guide,This is not helpful for developing leadership skills. This is a book about management or perhaps just his autobiography. Giuliani dicusses how to manage departments but very little in how to be leader. He never once discusses how he developed future leaders.The book has some interesting stories but one should look elsewhere for a better guide to developing leadership skills.
3,A typical ME ME ME book,"Being a mayor of city as huge as New York is a big challenge and responsibility. Looking backwards it can be easily said that Giuliani managed to bring city's prestige back, mostly by effectively fighting crime. He also faced huge challenges after 9/11 attacks and coped with them.Despite being a succesful mayor, he was nots so succesfull in book writing. It can easily be defined, that writing this book was part of his ambitions to become the president of USA so it is a openly ""me, me, me"" book.When reading it, sometimes it seems that he was fighting the bullies and rescuing people from Twin Towers all by himself.Still, he gives some valuable tips about succesfull leadership - every chapter is devoted to one exact feature. They are absolutely true, clear and easily implemented, so it's worth reading this book.In the end - one quick tip: if you're very busy, just read the taglines. In most cases that's enough."
5,Great piratical book on leadership!,"I really like this book a lot because Mayor Giuliani really shows you how he uses all leadership principles and how they have helped him run and better New York City. It's not like John Maxwell (I love John Maxwell books also:) or other books that talk about leadership and the five keys, pillars, secrets or things like that, he really shows you why integrity is important how it has helped him. Why working hard is important. The chapter on bullies is really great! This book is leadership in action. Sometimes I felt that he was boasting a little bit to much. I also believe that you still have to balance your life and I did not feel that Mayor Giuliani did that very well. All being said If you are serious about becoming a great leader then this book is for you!! It is really a 5 star!! The minor negatives are just to small. Enjoy"
3,Half way through,"I am about half way through this book, i do like it hpwever it is very repetative and somewhat confusing with all the names he mentions it's hard to remember what happened in the chapter before once you get to the next chapter."
4,A good example,"I have heard some great things about Giuliani, but this book made me believe all that I have heard. Giuliani's style of leadership while mayor is a great example for all of us learning the basics. He has set his course and kept to it. He knows what works for him and gives us the breakdown. Not that his course will always fit our own style of leadership, but it provides some great points to remember. At times, I felt myself reading an election bid for President. If he did run I would seriously consider him since I now feel that I have a better understanding of how he would take charge."
1,Pure Garbage,"Someone gave me this ""book' to read. What an unadulterated waste of time.Are these the type of people that we are supposed to hold up as heroes? Not!! I guess infidelity is OK just because you are a mayor?"
3,Real Hero of Sept. 11 and Much More,"I'll never forget the man who truly led America on Sept. 11 -- Rudy. With George Bush hunkered down somewhere, it was Rudy who stood tall, spoke credibly of both grief and strength and rallied the American spirit. Others would attempt to do the same later, but Rudy was there first. Just as he was there during Reagan's go-go '80s when Wall Street swindlers thought they could get away with bilking millions of ordinary people. They learned otherwise when Rudy led them off in handcuffs. Guiliani is a true man-of-the-people who sometimes go against even his own political party to do what's right. This book shows us all how it's done."
5,Great Insight for all elected officials,"As an elected official myself, I really appreciated Rudy's insight and practices in organizational management. I have recommended this book to my fellow governmental leaders. There is a lesson here for all of us, in creating opportunities for everyone empowered with responsibility to rise to the challenge, while empowering others to share in decision making and leadership roles. Some of his own observations about how he approached problem solving, and ""making his case"" will stay with me forever. I know I will be much more effective from the lessons I have learned from this book. A must read for those who already have assumed a leadership role!"
3,"They're good, but",They are as described - reusable. What I didn't care for is the fact that the stickers constantly lifted and curled. I thought they might stay in place until they were to be used again. My 3 1/2 year old son enjoyed it when he wasn't begging me to flatten the stickers out.
2,No Real Hook,"I expected better of Mr. Woods. This rambles along at a leisurely pace, introducing character after character - while the reader just waits for something to happen. Too much going on, too little excitement."
2,Lack of substance and interest,"I've read one other Stone Barrington book and enjoyed it, so I was looking forward to Cold Paradise - what a waste of time. This book read like an Archie McNally novel - light, fluffy, no ""thrill factor"" at all. I knew from the beginning how it was all going to turn out.If you enjoy reading fluff, you'll love it. If you're looking for a story with some substance, however, skip this one. It's not worth your time."
3,I love Stuart Woods but...,I love the stone books but this one had to many things going on. I couldn't really get in deep to anyone story because I was waiting for someone else to pop into the story. It was a easy read and it did keep my intrests but I hope the next Stone book is a little less jumbled with people.
3,Too Many Ex-Loves.,"Stuart Woods serves up so many ""ex-dishes"" for Stone Barrington to handle it is difficult to remember ""who was who"" or why they were important. Somehow, the story, which has a good premise gets lost in all of the previous encounters and Stone becomes a celluloid copy of his former self without the time to build the suspense necessary for a satisfying thriller.The image of Stone running around Palm Beach in Vance Calder's castoff clothes doesn't fit the suave Stone, whose taste and means gives him access to the finest of New York's haberdasheries. One kept hoping he'd find a charity outlet for their disposal.If like me, you enjoy the Barrington character, you'll keep reading to the end. A parody is good for relaxation, but we all await the next installment of Stone's adventures.Nash Black, author of ""Qualifying Laps"" and ""Taxes, Stumbling Blocks & Pitfalls for Authors 2007."""
4,Saw it coming . . . but that's OK,"I'd like to hang around with Stone Barrington for a couple of weeks, buy $150 dollar shirts for my friends, $50 dollar socks when I need the right shade, know what kind of an engine goes in a Bentley, and get $25,000 dollar watches from ex-lovers as a thank you. And the women. As Dino would say, ""Marrone!""It's good to be Stone. And that's why we go to read him, for the same reason we read Spenser and go see old Sean Connery movies as ""Bond. James Bond."" So what's wrong with that?I like to read Stuart Woods. I don't expect to remember any quotes, won't laugh too hard, never shed a tear, chuckle at Bacchetti's New York humor, and try (hard to do) to keep track of the women. So many women, so little time Stone might quip. You kind of saw this one coming in the third inning. Still good to read. 4 Stars. Larry Scantlebury"
3,Predictable!,"Not his best work but an enjoyable,quick read. This is one of those books that you figure out very early. You continue to read to see how the author actually brings it all together."
3,Not exciting like Woods' other books,"I'm a Stuart Woods fan and have read nearly all his books, but this is the only one I have not found exciting or very interesting. It's an easy read but was somewhat predictable and I did not feel much suspense building. I hope the next book is better, and more exciting, like his earlier books."
3,An Entertaining Read,This was the first Stone Barrington novel I have ever read and I thought that it was very entertaining. There were a few too many different uneccessary story lines (as others have said) that may leave a bit to be desiered if you've never read any of the other Barrington books. However the novel did continue to hold my interest and I did find it to be an entertaining read. If you are looking for a good light beach reading book this summer this is it!
3,Although I love Stuart Woods,"As well as the Stone Barrington character, this was not my favorite of his Barringtong books. While most Woods books aren't very predictable, this one was easily figured out too early in the plot. While there are twists and turns, the main idea was too obvious.Be sure to read ALL the Stone Barrington books before you read this one though...while not neccisarily a ""series"" this book does built tremendously on events that took place in previous Barrington books."
2,"Same Old, Same Old","If you have read previous Books in the Stone Barrington series, don't pay much to read this one. It's the same old story; rich clients, gourmet food, fast cars, hot broads. On the other hand, what's wrong with that story?Barrington, who eats incessantly, never exercises but never gains weight, is in Palm Beach cavorting with characters from previous Woods' novels. Woods even brings back some dead characters rather than bother writing something new.Unless you are new to the series, pass on the rehash."
2,Woods disappoints with cranked out thriller.,"I have read all of Wood's books and have enjoyed looking forward to the next, until now. Woods appears to be in his ""retirement years"" where writing is merely a way to squeeze cash out of his publisher...he certainly isn't putting much effort into his writing. This book proves the point. Instead of wasting time developing charaters and storyline, he reverts back to the rapidly stale getting Stone Barrington. To make matters worse, he decides to call up virtually every character and love interest from previous Barrington novels and throws them all together in a boring novel about a search for Paul Manning; a murderer from, again, a previous novel. Somehow, all the old love interests also ""just happen to be"" in Palm Beach where Stone is conducting his search from the deck of some wealthy techno tycoon's yacht. I hope Woods puts more effort into his next novel, otherwise he is about to lose a longtime fan."
2,Too Many Story Lines,"Woods is an excellent writer who has finally gotten too full of himself with this one. The story line starts out great, but in the middle of the book strays too far away to keep the reader interested. The basic story is captivating, but throwing in his ex-wife and ex-lover (whose child might be Stone Barrington's, although for some reason we never get closure or even acknowledgement on) just detracts without credibly changing the atmosphere. That is, except to lead to long, boring asides, like the drifting (read: dragging) yacht scene. Stone's new love interest is an engaging character through the first portion of the book, but she inconceivably becomes background noise through the remainder. Woods needs to refocus and bring quality, not quantity."
2,love boat: a male fantasy,the world of stone barrington is from the pages of a gq with an attitude or of a remington steele episode which has gone soft porn. as slick as the pages of playboy. all bare boned action featuring cardboard stereotypes of the chichi set in palm beach. mindless entertainment.
1,Awful; huge disappointment,"This story was so ridculous. Stone Barrington is asked to find a woman that Todd, a billionaire met in a restaurant in New York who went to Palm Beach (Todd doesn't even know her name). Of course Stone finds her almost immediately and discovers that he has previously defended her. Puhleeze! And then the billionaire allows him to stay on his yacht where of course Stone immediately beds Todd's assistant (I really don't what to call her, but she sleeps on the yacht too). And then there's Stone wacko ""wife"" who shows up. Story was way too stupid. Bring back Vance Calder from the dead. Stone is too boring at this point."
5,Stone,I love all Stone Barrington stories. This was a very good listen. It certainly makes the travel time go quickly.
1,Big Disappointment!,"What a disappointment! The plot goes nowhere, the dialog is boring and unrealistic, the characters have about as much depth as the piece of paper on which the book is written. I have read most of Stuart Woods' books and eagerly ordered this one, but it will certainly be the last one of his books I ever order."
1,contractual obligation,"Although Stuart Woods has written several excellent stories (Chiefs, Grass Roots), this latest book strikes me as a contractual obligation. Stone Barrington continues to fancy himself a ladies man and the sequence of events seem as likely as me winning a lottery. I sense that Mr. Woods, now that he has achieved a measure of success, has lost some of his creative story telling talents. An unfortunate occurance as he has shown a flair for telling a story. His readers, in my humble opinion, will disappointed by this latest effort."
4,Fun read,"Like all Stone Barrington novels this was an enjoyable read for a day at the beach. Also like all Stone Barrington novels it is very superficial and not very deep. The characters, including Stone, are all one dimensonal and the plot is fairly flimsy with a predictable ending. Yet despite these flaws it is still an enjoyable book. I guess the secret to his success is that the reader gets to live vicariously through Stone who basically has it all. Basically it is a ""trashy"" mystery novel, but a fun and easy read."
4,Not Perfect But Still Good,"No, Danzy Senna's Symptomatic didn't live up to her amazing debut, Caucasia. However, I still found it to be an interesting character study and an enlightening look at what biracial people experience in this country. I was particularly impressed with Ms. Senna's portrayal of her narrator's sense of isolation and loneliness. I would have liked for the book to have been a bit longer and to have explored the character of Greta Hicks in more detail. I almost didn't read the book based on the poor reviews. I'm glad I didn't pay attention to them because I found Symptomatic to be a compelling read and I enjoy Senna's writing style."
4,Glad I got the chance to read it...,"I almost didn't read Symtomatic but because I liked Caucasia (from 4 years ago)I went to the library and there it was. I like Senna's writing style, it's different from most of the author's writing I'm use to reading. Very dark and gothic-like. I liked the winter in New York setting, the creepiness and learning about the mysterious Vera Cross. I thought that the ending was interesting but I wonder if Senna put that in at the last minute when she was completing the novel. Maybe there should be a sequel to this or have the main character written into future novels. The only thing is that she didn't have a name. This book was good enough to make me wanna read her next novel."
4,The Review,"Captivating.I enjoyed this book as I identified strongly with the protagonist who is coming into her own.Although the protagonist is black she is fair to the point that she can pass for white and although that is not my dilemma (smile) I identified with her as for me she wanted people to see her for who she is and its not about denying who you are but also forging an identity for yourself.The plot twists in this book, especially one, takes you through, but is a ride worth taking.I commend the author, Danzy Senna, on her writing style as I was right there in the trenches and felt that I was reading about me and not about a character out of a book."
5,A beautiful book to cherish for life.,"Muffy VanderBear is a delightful character that you will cherish once you've seen this book. Muffy talks about her life, her friends and her spirit. She has a vivid imagination and you will delight in all the layers of information and interactive elements that she sticks in her special scrapbook. There are letters, postcards, games and even her passport with stamps from all over the world where Muffy has been. Children will love to look at the book again and again. Each page invites you into a special place where only Muffy can explain how a teddy bear dreams of being a butterfly or why teddies never age. This book is a special keepsake of a special bear's life and you will love reading about her wonderful adventures. Parents will love reading this book with their children and I'm sure it will soon become a family treasure as it has in my family."
3,Game for Kids,"If your looking for a realistic high-quality hunting sim, this is not it.I would recomend it for 13yrs or under. I got the game last night and I finished it within the next 5 hours. The hunting grounds are super tiny and you can see where animals are on your mini-map. The graphics have nothing going for them either. Not even a game for you if you just want to blast away at everything you see because doing so will cause you to fail the mission."
5,fun game,This is a really cool game. My kids and I enjoy it. There are several levels to play and I recommend it to anyone.
3,Cabela's African Safari review,I liked this game. I liked in on the PS2 when I had it.Pros: Fun game that makes you feel like you are in the wilds of Africa hunting animals other than the usual domestic deer & bears.Cons: Graphics - it was as though I was playing it on my PS2 - same graphics. Luckily it was/is the same game so I will keep it because it is fun.
1,Cabelas african safari,"This Disc was NTSC, so I couldn't use it on my European X Box 360.It isn't available in Europe.So I'm screwed basically.Thanks Microsoft.No complaints about the seller though. arrived quickly and in one piece etc"
2,Not as good as the old one that I had on OS 9.1.,"The four of diamonds has the number four, but five diamonds on it, which is irritating. More irritating are the cartoon characters wandering on and off, which I would definitely like to turn off if I could find a way to do so. There are not enough options on the plays.I do like the choices of styles for the face cards, and am currently using the Maya royalty."
1,OK Game - Installation Unfriendly,"While the games themselves are OK but Masque misses the mark with its unfriendly program installation. On a Mac, the program install in a users folder (whoever is installing) rather than the Application folder. If there is more than one user on the computer you have to install the program that many times (for each user) or drag the program to the Applications folder. If you take the latter option, the user must have Admin privelages on the computer in order to save game stats. Not an option in my household. There are no installation options other than what is hard-wired so if you do decide to place it in applications folder you have to manually move it after the install. Why chew up disk space with multiple itterations of a program and why use anything that requires you give Admin privelages to a user so they can get full benefit of the game features? It doesn't make sense."
2,Very disappointed in options...,The games seem to have help functions that can't be turned off. The screen is not easily modified. Very disappointed. I have already donated the cd to charity.
5,Best soliare game available!,"There are many options to choose from for solitaire games on the market, but none come close to the Masque system. Many tout their games/programs as ""the best,"" etc., but they're not even close. I know. I've tried them. Masque has it all right. Don't be fooled by the claims of others. I was. Now I have the best one and I enjoy it on a regular basis."
5,Intelligence by Osho,"The author deals with a complicated subject very simply. He givesgreat credit to animals for the intuitive reasoning that theypossess in the conduct of daily life. According to Osho, intelligence is not per se subject to precise measurement.In addition, there are conditions which impede intellectualrationalizations and applications. For instance, great stresscan inhibit our ability to function meaningfully on the creative or intuitive level. The author gives credence to the notion that relaxation methodologies; such as, formal meditationprovide the requisite environment for the creative side of ourintelligence to flourish and grow. The book provides a freshperspective on what constitutes intelligence and creativity.It would be appealing to a wide constituency of readers inbusiness, academe and the general readership.It is a good value for the price charged."
3,Awesome book!,"At first I was hesitant to buy this book because of the author. I questioned his credibility and ideology. But, after I read this, I am very glad I did. The book gives many examples to explain true intelligence and how to unlock it in you. You will learn something new and definitely be curious about other books by Osho."
4,Living in the Now,"Osho shows us that the only way we can truly be in the now is to be like animals or even young children who are able to just enjoy what is in their present. We as adults need to relearn this. It is our baggage, our fears that disallow us to be fully present. Osho shows us through various means that we can achieve this and then unleash our creative powers. Osho shows us a diferent approach to life, a more fulfilling one and one that feels as though we are of importance.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
2,pictures lie,"i ordered this because in the picture it shows to have the tubes, the tubes is what breaks and you cant buy them seperate, there are plenty on heater cores showing they don't come with tubes online and show that, this one shows it does but doesn't."
5,Here's to Good Health!,"I read somewhere that chocolate is now good for you. I don't remember where. It was just one of those things that stuck in my mind. I suppose it's because I've always liked chocolate, and especially really dark chocolate. Oh, you know, in that article, it also said that the darker the chocolate, the better it was for you. Go figure. Well, it used to be that chocolate was bad because it had a high fat content, but these days it seems that there's bad fat and good fat and chocolate has the good kind. Plus, this chocolate (70% Cacao content) is organic, not the ordinary kind. Modern nutrition is marvelous. Well, all of this came to mind as I strolled by the candy rack in a nearby Fresh and Easy Market where I was grocery shopping and this Green and Black's Dark Organic Chocolate Bar (3.5 ounces) was impossible to pass by. Did I mention that this bar is really tasty? Here's to good health!Gary Peterson"
3,Simple and Somewhat Effective,This workout offers you a different way to work your buns and legs besides traditional squats and lunges by using the disc-mostly. You still do a fair share of lunges and squats but you are able to take it up a level when you incorporate the discs. I only did the workout a couple of times as I found it boring and not as effective as it claims. It is a true legs and buns workout as you only do a few minutes of abs and upper body on the total body workout routine. I would recommend it to add something to your current routine but I wouldn't use it as my primary workout.
5,Excellent CD,"The CD is wonderful, a joy to listen to. Although I purchased it used, it plays like new. I have played it several times, and enjoyed it very much. This is one of my favorite Kingsmen lineups."
1,JON E HAND WARMER,WE LITE THESE WARMERS TWICE AND TWICE THEY WENT OUT WHEN WE NEEDED THEM MOST. WE USED TWO AND WISHED TO RETURNED TWO BUT WE THEN SEEN WE ONLY HAD FOURTEEN DAYS TO RETURN ITEMS.EXPENSIVE PIECES OF JUNK!
3,"Works, but not high quality","Purchased this at premium price mainly because it is made in USA. The product works with encouragement and serves the purpose, but I would have liked more quality for the price. Come on America, we can do better! I will add that this sifter is so much better than the squeeze type. I wish I still had my mom's sifter like this, it was the best."
1,Returned for refund,"Was received with some small dents around the top lip which appeared to be cosmetic only, but when we tried to use the for the first time it would not sift the flour. It appeared that the wires were not very close to the the screen which may have been slightly out of shape. It may have been possible to to play with this by reshaping the screen and manipulating the wires but one should not have to mess with a $25 sifter."
5,Four-flopper sifter as a gift and reminder of family history.,"My mother-in-law, who was among other things an excellent cook and baker in the traditional farming sense, insisted that a baker must have a ""four-flopper"" flour sifter to adequately prepare flour for baking. She passed away several years ago but I remember and use many things she taught me. When I discovered my son did not have a flour sifter, I wanted him to have a four-flopper, even though it does not have the same significance to him. There may not be as much need to sift flour now, but I am delighted to know that my son has a reminder of his grandmother, even though it is more a reminder to me than to him. Things are not people but sometimes they can be a reminder of wonderful people."
3,Fair,The consruction is somewhat disappointing as to older Bromwell shifters I've had. I had to bend and squeeze the can to get the blades to work correctly.
3,"Nice Try, But There Is a Better Theory","I have read different parts of the book. Certainly there is a neurological problem in CFS. But, there is another theory out. A Dr. Poesnecker who wrote Chronic Fatigue Unmasked 2000 is treating and healing patients of CFS or CFIDS left and right. His theory: The adrenals are the origin of the problem. He uses adrenal extract not cortisone to heal his patients in a very slow but sure manner. I am one of his patients. I have CFS. I also have adrenal insufficiency. A medical test proved it. I am in the process of being treated with adrenal extract. My insomnia is now gone and also my racing thoughts at night. I am now looking forward to a complete recovery."
1,Goldstein is wrong.,"He is out to make money on the sick, IMHO.His theory is all hot air. I do not know of one person helped by him.Sorry."
1,If the synopsis is any indication.....,"Inasmuch as Robert the Bruce never actually lived at Castle Tioram, as the book states according to at least one reviewer, I might exercise some caution......"
2,disappointed,This was not a very good book. . .I was disappointed because I had hope the author would have spoken from some depth.
1,FELLOWES LITERATURE ORGANIZER,THIS PRODUCT FALLS APART THE MINUTE YOU PUT ANYTHING ON IT . POORLY CONSTRUCTED AND NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD EVEN FEATHERS!
1,The lowest quality product I have ever seen,"I'm requesting a return for this product after attempting to assemble it for the past 20 minutes. The item is shipped with only dowels and craft glue to assemble. It is impossible to hold together. All of the shelves and compartments are made of cardboard. Not heavy duty, laminated cardboard. That might have passed as acceptable. Box grade cardboard that crumbles as you handle it. I have never been so disappointed. The product is impossible to assemble and if you manage to get it to stay together with the glue and toothpicks, it will crumble under the weight of 10 sheets of paper."
2,Not suitable for PEBC preparation,"As far as I know, there is no exam guide for PEBC and Canadian students have to use American guide books to prepare for PEBC. There are some good American books which contain a lot of information, this is definitely not one of them. Overall, the questions are too easy and too simple. The answers are often incomplete and there are many incorrect answers and questions. Actual PEBC questions are more complex and difficult and this guide book may only be useful in the beginning of preparation to see where you stand. I think Comprehensive Pharmacy Review and Appleton & Lange's Review of Pharmacy are much better books to study."
3,Get A Real Review Book Instead,"This book is great for quizzing you so you know what subjects to brush up on. THe CD can also get you used to the CAT format. But having taken the NAPLEX after using this book and several others, you will never see these questions on the NAPLEX. The chances of seeing the same question is almost zilch. Its better to know your key subjects well (HTN, DM, HIV, etc) then learn facts here and there about everything. That's what this book does for you. Its a compilation of specific questions. I recommend a review book such as APHA's Comprehensive Pharmacy Review, or Kaplans Naplex review instead. If you spend more time with these than the question books, you'll be glad when you see the questions pop on on the actual exam!"
5,Very Pleased!!!,We both this for my daughter's 4th Birthday and she loved it!!!! She have taken the pieces off MANY times and they still come off easy and apply to the book with No Problem! Her friends come over and they have a blast! I've really enjoyed watching her play with it and she even let's me change the outfits sometimes!
3,Dress up Clothes are see through,"My 5 year old daughter likes this book very much and is quite happy with it. My main contention is that the quality is mediocre. I like that the clothes are peel off vinyl and can be removed and restuck on the pages, but the color on the clothes are somewhat transparent so that you can see the princesses' undergarments through the dresses. I think that is pretty tacky and lame. But my little girl is fine with it."
2,Paint comes off,"The paint scratches and flakes off and the little pieces can easily get lost. I want to throw it out, but my 4-year-old won't let me."
5,Good for a pastime,"I bought this item as I thought it was inexpensive extra gift for Christmas. I thought it would be great for the 2 hour trips to Grandma. I was a little disappointed the at dresses were not darker as to not see the princesses under clothes through them. But that's an adult opinion.My daughter loves the book, loves dressing each princess each morning (perhaps to an annoying level, but it's good she likes to do something other than watch TV). She likes putting hats, shoes and necklaces on the scenery, such as fairies (Aurora page) and fish (Ariel page). It's a great activity book for those with young princesses of their own."
5,Great entertainment at low price!,This is the second one in about 2 years and not because of lack of quality but rather my 4 yr old daughter plays with it nearly everyday. Great for pack and play breakfast or airplane rides. We make up new stories everytime about the princesses sharing clothing. It's great! Highly recommend for any young girl or boy.
3,"Great for little girls, but pieces tend to get lost","My 5 yr old daughter loves the book and changing dresses, but the pieces are tiny and easily lost or vaccumed up. They stick for the first couple times, but then they lose their stickyness to the book."
3,great idea - needs some work,My 4-year old loves this book but the pieces do not stick well and tend to fall off or stick to the opposite side of the page when she closes the book. Great for keeping her busy for awhile but she gets frustrated when the stickers do not stay right where she wants them.
1,bad,"only worked for 4 days and then it stopped spinning , now i am stuck with it it does not work i should of returned it but i did not so it sits there collecting dust"
2,Must be an acquired taste,I got this book as a Christmas gift along with a painting by the artist. He's a good artist. Make no mistake about that. But you'd better be an ardent gamer to really enjoy his subject matter.
5,"New Age, but in a good way.","I am not a huge fan of new age so I am hesitant to call this CD by that title, it is more like relaxation music. Sacred Light is perfect for calming you down after a rough day or just bringing a little more light into a already great day. Whatever the case Sacred Light is a great CD and Ruth Cunningham has taken a strong step into her first solo album."
5,A Massage for the Soul,"Warmth and sunshine and pleasantness, together with peace and tranquility and contentment envelope you as you relax with this beautiful CD. It's like a massage for the soul."
3,"Great Concert, but does she have to drop the ""F"" bomb?","I thoroughly enjoyed the film style of the concerts, and audio and video quality of the Blu-Ray version. Rather than reiterate what many others have described so well, I only want to make one unfortunate comment that Sara drops an ""F"" bomb while speaking to the audience. Considering I watched this with little kids, I felt this was very inappropriate, and unnecessary to have not edited it out of the final production."
1,So-So Concert,Was at the Filmore. Loved Raining Jane. Sound quality at the Filmore was not great. Hope they do a real good job cleaning it up...
5,found captain zero,fast paced and beautifuly writteni read it in a day and its no small booki found the author managed to drag me in and keep me enthrawlednow i gotta buy cosmic banditoscant wait
2,"Not much insight, but an entertaining read","Surfing is something different to all people, the author has his opinion, I have mine. I didn't find much insight into the human experience through the author's eyes, I perceived the lesson to be about karma, of which the main character shouldn't be surprised about his current state.My opinion only, the book is entertaining. How can you go wrong with a book about surfing?""Everybody must give something back for something they get.""-Bob Dylan"
3,Great Disposable Writing but Nothing Profound Here,"Zero is one of those titles you pick up when you want mindless rambling to distract you from the complexities of life -Weisbecker's biggest worries in life are finding the perfect wave & reuniting with long lost surfer brother, Christopher. We should all have a life this ""complicated."" I found the surfer lingo exquisitely trite however the storyline was amusing. This book is perfect if you're suffering from a male midlife crises and want to relive the endless summer days of your youth when chicks still found your saggy surfer body attractive."
1,Confusing at best,I have very little to say other than this guy can not write! He continues to belittle and criticize all those he encounters throughout his travels. I was fortunate enough that I bought this at a garage sale for $1. It took me to about pg 4 to realize I had been fooled into buying this and at about pg 23 I had to leave it on the subway as it became unbearable to slog through utter nuanced garbage. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!
2,Too clever,"I guess I'll have to be one of the few dissenters about how great this book is. For me, the author's intent is show us how great a writer he is by using language that interferes with the story. Two examples: ""Besides, I don't want to be caught driving off-road after dark and I'm burning daylight with the fuel of indecision"" or ""I'm struck by the mood to record his visage now, before my instincts are skewed by too much knowing."" This is the kind of writing you'll find over and over and over on every page. I made it to page 15 and you'll find my copy at the local used bookstore. It apparently appeals to many readers but I find it annoying and distracting."
4,"Good even for non-surfers, even if a bit testosterone driven","Weisbecker weaves a captivating tale right from the start as he recounts his search for his long-time friend who vanished after heading to Central America some years prior. The fact that Weisbecker even embarks on such an unlikely pursuit, is made all the more fascinating because it's reportedly based in fact.The tale will be best received by surfers, as it describes his multiple stops along the way in search of good waves. Having said this, these elements are not done in such a heavy-handed fashion that they would distance the casual reader. What I did find heavy-handed, and this is my sole criticism, is that I sometimes found Weisbecker's writing style to be what I can perhaps best describe as ""testosterone driven."" A bit too much machismo comes through at points, which I believe could in fact distance female readers. I found it particularly interesting since his editor is a woman. Regardless, it's an enjoyable read nonetheless."
2,Not the *official* new siddur...,"Readers may be confused by the description of this book as the `long-awaited new prayer book' of the Reform movement because of the authorship by Stern. It is not. That siddur is called Mishkan T'filah (Tabernacle of Prayer) and has not yet been made available to the public. No slight intended to Mr. Stern, who has apparently incorporated the same changes agreed by the Reform movement into his version, but this really should be made clear in the description of the book."
1,I Tried to Order this But....,"It's interesting that this prayer book is still listed for sale here, as I recently attempted to purchase it and was told by Amazon that it was not available (after I waited for three months). I love Amazon, but if this book is not findable it shouldn't be listed here for sale. It's disappointing to order a book one really wants only to be told it can't be located."
3,An egalitarian Siddur for Jews looking to bring daily prayer into their lives,"The language is gender-neutral, many of the readings and prayers are modern. And yet this book offers an excellent alternative to often hard-to-follow and entirely male-focused traditional Siddurim.But there is also something missing. In the rush to correct the exclusion of all female pronouns and to recognize the matriarchs along side the patriarchs as we pray, something was lost. It's hard to find and identify some time-based prayers here. And much of the personal communion with G-d so present in a traditional Siddur has been replaced by the group or community focus the editors of this volume seem to favor.As a woman, it's a better choice for me than a Siddur that talks only about our forefathers and not our foremothers, or one that seems anxious to use the male ""he"", ""King"", or ""Lord"" as often as possible (despite our knowledge as Jews that G-d has NO gender!). But it's still not quite what I was hoping for."
4,lesson to be learned,"This book is really cute. I originally bought it for my 10 year son whom has difficulty ""sitting still"" however, my 5 year old LOVES it!!! I am glad I made the purchase because whomever is reading it is getting the important message of sitting sit!"
5,secure your pistols.,"This unit is available for many brands and calibers of pistols. You can carry even Glock's safely. I have for a 9mm, .40 both Glock's, and, Kimber 4"" .45acp. You can hike, run, hang like a monkey etc 5 stars !"
5,You did it again!,"Lauri Ward's book is the perfect little weapon for all decorating problems, especially non-obvious ones! After reading her first book I was thrilled to get my hands on her second book and learn even more. I'm so glad someone out there has made me feel like I can take my home into my own hands. It's very rewarding to beable to fix my decorating problems in minutes whether I'm just taking a break from my work, or in an artsy mood. Thanks!"
3,Helpful but a little bossy...,"While I enjoyed most of the suggestions in this book, I did not enjoy the way it was presented. I felt a little like a new recruit in bootcamp! Yipes! And what to do about my beautiful leather loveseat? Throw it out? I did however rearrange my living room so that my fireplace in the corner AND television nearby are both focal points. HELLO... we are real people with real homes and YES we do occasionally watch television in our real home. Color pictures would be great too. Maybe we have all just been conditioned by glossy magazines companies to expect pretty color pictures with our text. Well, we are the demanding and drooling public and WE WANT PICTURES! I'm glad I borrowed this one from the library and didn't purchase it first!"
5,Trade Secrets,"It is wonderful to have a follow-up book to Use What You Have Decorating! The book is full of sound advice that is easy to understand and follow. If you are beginning the decorating process or just want to refresh what you already know, this book is for you. I highly recommend it."
1,Save Your Money,The design ideas in the photos of this book are generally poor and not at all in keeping with what one would expect to get from this author. Her use of art is way overdone and totally top heavy and flies in the face of good design.
5,help from someone who knows what she's doing,"Lauri Ward's classic design principles are the ""gold standard"" as far as do-it-yourself home decorating. You MUST know the rules FIRST. If you wish to break them, that's up to you.Trade Secrets takes over where Use What You Have left off. Both books, together, give you the foundation for tasteful decor. TRADE SECRETS is a definite MUST BUY!"
5,REALLY USEFUL INFORMATION,"...This book is a no-frills, practical, quick read that is already providing me with invaluable information. It has lots of easy decorating tips that I have started to implement already."
2,VERY old video!!!!,"The description states that the DVD was released in 2006. However, as my husband and I watched it, the video was clearly very outdated. At the end of the DVD, the production date was shown as 1990 (as in 19 years ago!) I have been on an Alaskan cruise and was hoping to show my husband some of the beauty of Alaska and the inside passage. If you are ""into"" museums, native dancing, local artists, etc. then perhaps this might be of interest to you. But if you are looking for more complete (and up-to-date) information on scenery, sightseeing and excursions while visiting Alaska, save your money!"
3,Not a set I would choose again,"Basically my daughter got the Loving Family kitchen set for her birthday that she already owned, so I took that set back to Toys R Us to exchange for some other LF set. Their selection was abysmal (right after Christmas) and I didn't want to go home without a LF set to give her so I took this set (along with the African American mom and baby, which was a good buy).This set is just kind of ... not that interesting. It might be more interesting if they included a real rabbit instead of painted on ones (the cats and dog are some of the favorite pieces of the LF dollhouse). The hose keeps on coming unrolled, and the kids don't find the flowers that interesting. They do like the apron though. The apron fits well onto the mom or grandma.I can see why this was the only set left in the store!"
2,Not so hot!,"Two years ago I purchased a mail cart which has since been discontinued. I was so pleased with it I looked for a product that would be similar. I thought this would be the one. I don't recommend it. The cart was more expensive, cheaply made and difficult to put together. I am very disappointed."
4,An excellent reference book for study of psychic phenomena.,"Kole and Holley, both professional magicians with over 60 years combined experience in illusion, tackle the questions surrounding the authenticity of psychic phenomena and astrology. This is a great study guide with easy-to-reference passages from their years of research. The authors present their evidence against that of the ""pro-psychics"" for a well rounded view of the issues. It's short but packed with solid research. Highly recommended."
2,"Disappointing, but the disappointment is in the product, not the business","My book arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The book seller I got it from handled things professionally and expediently. However, the product itself was a disappointment. Not only is it written ffrom a space of fear, but it's research is out of touch with 21st century America. The only criticism I have about the book itself (and the bookseller) is that, if it is a skeptic's guide, then that should be listed on Amazon as well as the title. There's nothing more annoying than anticipating a book with a title like that, and then finding out that it is slanted and ill-researched. I like this book seller, and will continue to do business with them as the situation arises, and on my end I will do more research, since that is truly where the mistake was!"
3,Fundamentalism Undermining Its Own Premises?,"Kole and Holley set out to undermine belief in astrology and psychic phenomena, but do so through methods that are incommensurate with their own worldview. I applaud evangelical Christians who are willing to listen to scientific discourse on these matters, and realise that replicability and research design are good guides for public policy. However, the methodological problem here is that we only have a priori opinion and skewed interpretative communities that provide us with evidence of the existence of Christ. We only have their word for it that the historical entity in question was capable of supernatural feats,and no direct evidence that was the case. I do not accept the existence of those alleged miracles, and neither would most of the Skeptical sources that are cited. The fundamentalist belief in miracles needs to be held to stronger Lockean standards of empirical proof, which the authors admirably provide for astrology and ""psychic phenomena."""
2,Just painting,"If you are looking for examples of different color combinations that you just wouldn't think of, this book has some pretty unusual pictures. If color in any other medium is your plan, this bowon't help that much. There are no pictures of buildings with siding or house trim ideas or anything.I think its use is limited but it's pretty to look at"
2,Not easy to make any sense of.,"Well... All I can say about this book is that my money would have been better spent on something else, for it is the most boaring and my least favorite of all the study materials I have on the subject. I give it 2 stars only because it's got to have something of use to the average student somewhere within, or they wouldn't have published it, or would they? I just havent found that something yet. Perhaps you will. Good luck."
2,Unclear explanations,"I bought this book because it was touted as good for an absolute beginner. However, the directions are written for someone who has experience with all of the tools and skills for beading. I'm quite disappointed."
1,Pretentious crap,This band can't play its way out of a wet paper bag.And the singer sounds like he is gargling Drano. And the lyrics are stupid.Maybe next time they should try writing songs first and then getting wasted.
5,Beautiffuly made!,This was ordered for a custom necklace and the customer was thrilled with it. The quality is excellent and I would deinitely recommend.!
3,Many of the problems in this book could appear in late middle and hish school texts,"Moscovich is excellent at putting together bind bending puzzles. However, while some of the items in this collection do bend the mind, many are relatively easy, almost trivial. For example, on page 55 there is the problem, ""What is the probability of rolling either a four or a six on a given toss of a die?"" On page 59 there is a binary treat the fourth level and the question is ""Can you tell how many birds will be sitting on its branches by the tenth generation?""As this sample indicates, there are many problems of the type that appear in finite mathematics textbooks at either the late middle or high school level. Therefore, if you are an advanced puzzler, a great deal of this book will not challenge you."
5,"Review of ""Through the Patient's Eyes""",I find this book very interesting and highly relevant to the study and importance of patient expereince which is my research area. In my section we use this book as reference to both conceptual framework but also as reference when interepreting empirical results in our studies. This book should be mandatory to everyone studying patient experience or patient satisfaction.
5,A Memorable Memoir,"Suzanne Tilden-Mortimer's book ""Do I Know You"" is a book that I will remember reading for a very long time. It is extraordinary in every way. Because my own mother passed away from Alzheimers-related complications, many of the stories Suzanne has told rang clearly in my memory.The story of her daughter Carey simply broke my heart. I know what it's like to watch a mother figure crumble - but watching your own child's life unravel and spiral downward had to be its' own private hell.The life of a caregiver is demonstrated vividly; a sometimes thankless job with more than its' share of sorrow and pain. This book pulls no punches and would be invaluable to caregivers of all types dealing with any kind of homecare situation. The reality of day to day life is spelled out in graphic and honest detail.I know the word is often over-used and usually said as a gratuitous comment - but in my case I say it from the heart when I say this book is simply ""stunning""....."
4,Disappoint Ed,"The text is great, BUT No maps or illustrations is UNACCEPTABLE!!!!Either Kindle or Desert Book totally screwed up .They should correct the problem and reissue corrected to all past and future buyers"
5,Great Book.,"In this first novel, ""the Shadow of the Succubus"", a writer checks into a Vermont Inn to recover his muse. He gets more than he bargained, not only with the colorful townspeople but there is a haunted hotel thrown in, to boot! In the second novel, ""the Eternal Thirst"" Condenzio has an outstanding story of a demon hunter. Forget ""Van Helsing: The Movie"". This is the blood chilling drama without the over-the-top Hollywood camp. In both I found the prose robust and articulate (reminds me of the late Clark Ashton Smith) and the characters and scenes were vivid. Whether you like Josh Whelan's ""Angel"" or just like neo-gothic suspense, then this one is for you. If ""Shadow"" is patterned after Wilde, I found in ""Thirst"" homage to his friend ""Stoker""."
3,So far so good,"Pros:Got the product today, does a decent transfer. I havent tried speed test on it so far. When connected to a USB 2.0 Port, speed is better than a USB 1.1. When i connected the device to a toshiba pocket pc e335 through a USB host cable, it did not automatically detect the device, but when i loaded PHM's device manager and tap on other devices it comes alive. (You need a freeware USB mass storage driver to see the disk)Cons:Casing does not look sturdy when compared to Sandisk 256MB cruser."
1,Not Marketing or Engineering info about the Microsoft Xbox,"This is about Xbox Technologies, the company, not the Microsoft Xbox gaming console or anything to do with it."
4,Thrilled,"Purchased for son. Quite pleased with the book, however, as noted in shipping documents, a corner was slightly damaged. The damaged is almost unnoticeable, otherwise very pleased. The material seems to be very comprehensive."
3,Very handy to introduce custom dragons and gear,"This is a very good resource book with plenty of details given about the primary dragon races. The main (and really only) down side is that it wasn't pubilshed after the conversion to v3.5. Still a really good resourse, but can get pricey"
2,A great big beautiful pile of nothing.,"When I first got this book, I thought it was great. It has lots of cool artwork, it's about dragons, it's ... well shiny and pretty and ... I'll never use 80% of it. Unless you're an absoluted dragon fanatic whose never read anything about them in his/her life, this books will seem like a waste of time. It's very specific about what each dragon type is like, their habits, their color, their young, the way they brush their teeth after eating and adventurer, but who cares about that. Who at Wizard of the Coast decided that dragons had to fit into such stagnant, uninteresting categories? They're not crocodiles. Aside from one or two prestige classes, a small handful of feats, and a few spells, this book is a waste of money, which means I'm glad I paid $5 for it on ebay. It's an absolutely gorgeous book, but it just plain wrong and really will never fit into a campaign I run."
2,"Been there, done that.","Not as good as the one done for Second ed. It is good, but not worth the full price. They don't add enough new stuff to make it worth while. They even left out the Sunwyrm from the Fiend Folio."
1,A Waste of Time & Money,"I have bought and used these organizers before, but I'm afraid the quality has really deteriorated in the past decade. First order arrived damaged and had to be replaced. Second order arrived in good condition, but it is not possible to assemble it correctly because the dowels provided are too small for the drilled holes. No amount of glue can compensate for this flaw. I don't know whether to reinforce it with angle brackets, or send the dumb thing back and give up."
1,Waste of money,"Made of cheap cardboard. Could MAYBE support the weight of a very small stack of paper on each shelf, 20 sheets would be my best guess at the max number of sheets of paper per shelf without the whole thing collapsing in a matter of months. Returned this because it was not described at the time as being made out of cardboard."
2,Very weak effort from a great filmmaker,"If you want to see Mimi Rogers ... then get this video. She is ...through most of it and she is stunning. However if you are wanting to see a Nicolas Roeg film then you will probably be disapointed. There isn't much to say about this. After watching it, I felt a little sad at seeing a once great director wasting his talent with material that was beneath him. What happened Nick?"
3,I Want to Massage Mimi,"This movie is such a disappointment because you really wish that there could be good acting and a good story to go along with the gorgeous Mimi Rogers -- but it's not so great. If you want this erotic sexy movie soft-core you would be better off with ""Sexual Intrigue"" or even ""Body Heat"" which is not as naked a movie, but is very good acting and story. To me, the whole point of these movies is to get the girls turned on for the rest of the evening activities, especially now that I have perfectedthe mastery techniques of the video ""New Sex Now."" But this Mimi Rogers movie doesn't score the job so well because it's not a very compelling movie, so the girls don't get turned on, they just get antsy to go home."
1,Porno without nudity...,"That's very impressive, I've never seen before puritan porno, and this is it. I thought porno is when you see intercourse and male nudity and all this is dirty (and I hate prono), and erotique is when it is limited to female nudity and full of romance (which is my preference). In this film you see Mimi fully front nude only a couple of times for few moments, that's it. Most of the film she is dressed ok for the party, it's just she covers with the towel what would be covered with the evening dress. So by this definition it's neither prono, no erotique. But it is porno, it's how piritans would make it. Imagine porno film, where intercourse and nudity are taken out, but all the dirt left intact. You'll get the picture. Do not buy it, it's a waste of money and time."
5,Mimi's breasts in starring role!,Who cares about massage? Mimi's chest is the star of this movie. The video may be pricey but when you see her chest you will think it's a bargain!
1,Full Body Massage,I saw this movie originally when it came out. The VHS I purchased was edited and a lot of scenes were cut or removed. I wished I had not bought this product.
1,Buyer-beware!,"Don't buy movies from Australia!Australian movies suffer from a retarded censorship system... if it looks like some girl in the background MIGHT have her top off then they will just cut the scene regardless of plot... I kid you not, right at the part ""& the murderer is!"""
1,Bad beyond belief,"Any way you look at this, it's a complete letdown. The plot is idiotic. The nudity is dull, poorly photographed and so unflattering that there isn't a single exciting moment.What were they thinking?"
3,"Unrealistic drama, poor massage technique, but sexy Mimi....","If you thought you would learn about yourself, the characters, or massage you're looking at the wrong video. But if you want to see Mimi in all her splendor and glory....look no further. For those of you who were comtemplating your first massage, believe me, they aren't like this."
3,Mimi Rogers.... wow....,A so unreal plot with senseless flashbacks. But Mimi Roger's bod rules -- no question about it. Don't bother about her acting (or lack thereof). Anybody who's interested in mature ladies' beauty just can't miss this one.
3,Best Chest Laying Abreast,"The plot is the title here as the dialogue requires a French nationality to believe in. That doesn't mean there aren't some good discussions here. It's just not ever the intended meat of the show. Worldly life philosophies don't put me off but I know they put some people to sleep. The cure is- turn volume down.Starring Mimi Rogers (see my review title) & Bryan Brown from Gorillas in the Mist & F/X, Mimi puts her full body in Full Body Massage & Bryan Brown is one Lucky S. O. B. that gets points for being able to read his lines ( I doubt he could remember them). The cutting room floor was a good reason for this DVD to of had an outtake disk. We unfortunately didn't get one.If you rent or buy this you already know why you did it. Please leave all Playboy & Penthouse excuses at the door. 90 min's of rub a dub-dub. Hubba, hubba. I do wish this had been a screen film. The cutting room would have gotten less.3 1/2 stars for the movie. 5 stars for the bodacious Mimi Rogers."
2,I never knew Mimi was so HOT,OH MY GOD. I couldn't believe my eyes. Mimi Rogers is built. Thank you Mimi for giving us this video. I'm obsessed with this woman's chest now. I've got to buy this movie.
4,4 1/2 Stars -- Not The Run Of The Mill Legal Thriller!,"Line Of Visiom, an Edgar winner and David Ellis' first book, is well worth reading. The plot, which involves the confession by Marty Kalish, an investment banker, to killing his lover's husband and the trial to defend him is well-developed, the characters -- and especially the main character -- are very credible and three-dimemsional and the pace, once the trial begins, is faster than a speeding bullet. If that's not enough to generate interest in reading this strong first effort, it's filled with red herrings and lots of surprises. The only factor that keeps me from giving Line Of Vision a 5-star rating is that Ellis takes a bit too long to get to the trial portion of the book. Despite this minor criticism, Line of Vision is a well above average legal thriller and David Ellis is an author that deserves your attention. Enjoy!"
2,Below Average.,"No atmosphere, no action, no villian, no steam, no surprises. Stretches the trial out unnecessarily. Lightweight fare; mostly dialog. Could appeal to someone looking for easy reading."
4,Very good story teller,"This book firmly belongs to sub-genre of legal thrillers.That usualy means some confusing crime(mostly murder)has been described in a confusing manner in order to confuse the reader.I don't read many of those books.They are more plot driven and weaker on character developement then I prefer.All that said, Mr.Ellis is a very good story teller and even if I am not a convert to legal mystery as such, I wouldn't mind reading few more of his books."
3,"Decent, but you scratch your head at the end","The protagonist is either a manipulated fool or a genius, he can't be both. The book reads well but betrays the readers trust at the end."
1,Forget it,"This may have won the Edgar, but once again those guys on the panel have lost their compass [they aren't the same judges from one year to the next, which is why the Edgar can't maintain its quality]. After a stupendous selection last year of David Liss' A Confederacy of Paper, this novel is a total disappointment. In the first place, it's written in the present tense. In the second, the narrative is sophomoric. If you like hard hitting legal thrillers or hardboiled detectives, this book will not excite you. Borrrrring is the only word for it."
5,scheming duos,"a legal thriller worthy of the name. the question is not who did it, but rather what version of events will the jurors buy. plausible scenarios ably crafted by the prosecution and defense and adjusted along the way according to the shifting plotting and conniving of the protagonists. an excellent debut novel, not to be missed by fans of legal fiction."
3,A Good Story With a Twist at the End,"Having read ""Life Sentence"" a few months ago, I looked forward to reading the author's first book. This book is about Marty Kallish, an investment banker who confesses to his lover's husband, whose body has yet to be found. The rest of the story centers around Marty's digging into the life of his lover and he finds (and so do we) things aren't always as they seem. A pretty good story that tended to drag in places, but the end is worth the trip."
4,"Another outstanding product from Doreen Virtue, supplied by Amazon.com","Doreen Virtue's work and ""Angel Wisdom"" is great! However, The CD Angel Medicine is a great tool for meditation and peace of mind. I recommend this for anyone that wants to learn meditaion as a start to healing."
3,Pleasant.,"I purchased this CD, because I enjoy the books written by Doreen Virtue. I have been using guided meditations for over 25 years. However, this is one of my least favorite meditation tapes. The imagination is wonderful and the message is healing. I just have a hard time with the unevenness in the way it is spoken, the uneven flow between guided images, and I wish some of the words would have been chosen more carefully. That being said, I am still happy to have experienced one of her meditations. I love her books."
4,Wonderful,"I liked this book as well as the CD. If you've read/heard her previous books , then you already know her easy communication style . She describes her travels to interesting places and new information she has found along the way ."
5,Best History I've Ever Read,"I received this book as a gift for my 18th birthday. I was not looking forward to read this massive volume, but very quickly, I couldnt put it down, and finished this book in a week and a half. I avoided TV, the internet and even sleep to read more.Anderson, like William Manchest, author of ""A World Lit Only By Fire"", are great story tellers, and informative.Anderson shows the enormity of this war, the great span of the first world war, which was fought on the fields of Prussia, mountains of Appalachia, trade routes of South East Asia and over the sugar of the Carribean.My words do not give this book justice, to put it simply, it is a great read and I recommend it to anyone.-student in Scotland"
5,5 stars,"This is the only book on the 7 years war you need.Well written, packed with details and information!"
4,Excellent,"I won't try to restate what so many other reviewers have said in praise of this book, because they're right. Anderson explains more about the Seven Years War than I ever imagined could be told, and why it was truly a history-changing event for so many people. But he also notes how such results were never inevitable, even through the repeal of the Stamp Act which marks the narrative's end. Lots of individual events and people spiraled into the results we now take for granted, especially in the wake of what happened after the mid-1760s.The book is long but not terribly difficult to read. Anyone who really wants to understand U.S. history and/or that of how the British Empire came to be, simply must read this book."
5,Best book on the Seven Years War available,"This book is amazing. Anderson uses a large amount of sources for his argument and he writes very well. Through 700 pages Anderson never loses sight of his stated objective, which is to write about the Seven Years War as a separate event and not the small skirmish leading to the American Revolution that many of us think...a good book..."
2,Lost in the Forest,"The book wasn't at all what I expected - there's no disputing that the author knows his topic but tailors the text towards a predominantly USA readership. I'm a New Zealander, wanting to know more about the taking of Canada from the French. I got bogged down in interminable petty disputes between the Native Americans and the colonists. Every now and then there'd be a reference to an upcoming Revolutionary general - I picked up on Washington but a lot of them passed me by. That part was almost similar to a movie prequel. I gave up after working solidly through over a hundred pages.So, if you want to know about the Seven years War in North America, I'd suggest going elsewhere. If you want to know what your favourite revolutionary general was up to prior to 1776, want some local background on your area - it's in here."
1,Bad writing,"I know bad writing when I read it, and this is bad. This is a long book, but mostly because the author chooses to write a paragraph to express a sentence. And the observations he does make are banal. For those of you looking for well-written and well-conceived history, this is not your book."
5,Great one volume history of the 7 yrs war,"I'm not a colonial historian by any means but by my reading I thought this was a well put together, comprehensive, and clarifying history of the Seven Years War. I think its most important component is the degree to which it goes to explain the importance of inter-tribe relations as well as Euro-Indian relations as factors in the war's development and outcome. The quick snippets about Frederick's campaigns throughout Prussia were very well written and terrific to read. One criticism is that it that there is not as much contextual information about the pre-war French empire in North America and the Caribbean, as well as background on the war policy deliberations of the French court, as I would have liked."
3,Good But Not Great,"Overall, Crucible of War is a pretty good but not a great read. At times it is riveting. But other times it bogs down in too much detail, especially political detail.The major weakness of the book is the author's bias. The overall tone is decidedly anti-British/American. He also has an anachronistic, politically correct view of Indians, which makes large parts of the book all but unbearable to knowledgeable readers. (Read Allan W. Eckert's ""Wilderness Empire"" for a more reasonable treatment of the Indians during this war.)"
1,Broken joy!,Purchased as a gift for me by my husband. It arrived broken in several pieces. It was not packaged well from the company. In fact it appeared to be a older product maybe sitting on the shelf as the manufacturer's box was covered in dust. Quite possible it was broken when sent from Amazon. I would love to order again because I love Nao and the price is outstanding but I am afraid it too will end up broken on arrival. Help Amazon! Assure the items arrive in good condition. Try using UPS to ship they are much more careful than the USPS.
2,Becareful when using with intel Mac OS,"Could never get this to interface properly with my Mac laptop or Imac. The tech support at Nikon really put in a tremendous effor tto get it right but to no avail. I would have to say that perhaps because I'm using OS 10.4.10 the Nikon software wasn't compatable. Other than the unit being way overpriced, if it worked I would have kept it. Nikon software with Mac OS's seem to always have issues."
2,Nikon WT-3A Wireless Transmitter for Nikon D200,Nikon needs to help the public with this one. Its well constructed but not user friendly. It would take a software engineer to get it to work...
5,Great idea,The dinosaur mat is so colorful and just really beautiful. The quality is very good and changing the item from a floor mat to a box is very simple. My son loved this for Christmas.
3,Good for addition to dinosaur collection,"Does not include dinosaurs, so is only useful if the child already has them in possession. The box is pretty cool for the way it's designed and the graphics. Good for holding all the dinosaurs. When it opens, it does not lay completely flat due to the bumps from the straps, so often the toys are not able to stand and fall over. If the toys are big enough or stand on 4 legs, no problem, but the 2 legged ones struggle to stay 'on their turf'. Not really a big problem once the imagination kicks in, so a good toy for kids and stimulating for creativity."
4,Dino bin review,I think this product is great. It doubles as a fun area for my son to play with his dinosaurs and as a storage bin when he is done. He really enjoys it.
5,A favorite of my nieces'!,"This is a great story about assumptions. The things that *seem* like they'll be good (getting a balloon) turn out to be bad, and the things that *seem* like they'll be bad (waking up a lion) turn out to be good after all!We go back and forth like that, but there's a happy ending. That's GREAT!"
2,HOT WHEELS Slot Car Racing Police Pursuit Set,"It's not as good as I thought it would be. The cars move nicely and stay on the track, but the track just comes apart and you need to keep re-seating them. This gets tiring having to perform this function several times a day. It's durability will be short lived. These things are nothing like the tracks we had when we were kids.I must say that it has provided a decent amount of fun for our twin boys. They like it and the only thing they fight about is who is going to be ""the man""."
3,Read before you buy,It's awesome once you buy the batteries... i had one of these when i was a kid... and it plugged into the wall... this one has a battery pack that takes 4 D batteries... Let me go back to 1980 and get them... come on... who has these lying around?But once you get the batteries... hours of mindless drunk racing fun!
3,Flimsy fun,"My slot car set was one of my favorite toys as a child, so I bought one for my nephew. I don't remember if mine was this flimsy. The track junctions are very sloppy, but the cars seem to go over well enough. We had to custom build the overpass supports as the included ones didn't keep the track level."
1,Fell apart LITERALLY within 5 Minutes,The cars fell apart within minutes out of the box. The track wouldn't stay together. The remote controls didn't work. It was worthless. Someone got this for my kids for Christmas. The pieces were cheap and flimsy. I was going to take it back but my husband was so exasperated he just threw it away. You may want to consider something different.
4,THE AutoHarp Master,"OK, so Bryan Bowers' singing isn't the best, but the instrumental work is outstanding. Several tracks stand-out for listening again & again. If you've ever had the opportunity to see this musician perform live, you'd love to have this album as a lasting memory..."
2,"Great songs, Bad recording!!","I love the Nat King Cole Trio. But save your money on this one, folks. While the songs are great, the recording quality is not. Lots of white noise ruined this CD for me."
2,"His crystal ball was badly, badly broken","Having the advantage of hindsight, I picked up this book 3 years after publication and saw that he had concluded with the hilariously off prediction that AOL would dominate the AOL-TW merger and that this power would be the king of media.He got just about everything wrong with this wrapup prediction. The AOL types were spanked in disgrace, to the point of their name being taken off the bldg in New York, and TW is not ruling the roost by a long shot."
5,"Great Beach Read, Beautifully Written","Money to Burn is an exceptionally well-written book that offers a look into the mind of a federal judge and a criminal planning a heist. The book is that much more interesting since the judge and criminal are the same man.Read this book as a fast-paced crime novel, or for a chance to peek inside the mind of a federal judge or both. I loved the book for its realistic detail of the crime and of the Chicago that the characters inhabit."
3,reads like a screenplay,"I thought the first half of this book was building up quite well.There was good character development and decent depth to make it a non-linear story.But for me, once the heist was perpetrated it started to read like a screenplay for an so-so movie (eg see Sneakers for a similar break-in/heist premise). The storyline became too contrite for my liking (ie almost every prescient move of the criminals resolved to some masterstroke).I liked the court cases that the judge presided over, some of them got me intrigued about the author's moral judgements.(no pun intended ;-P)Still, if this was a movie I would go see it. As a book I expected more (especially for a debut effort).Overall I would say I am marginally satisfied but I won't be seeking any future books from this author."
3,"Money to Burn , but well worth it","An exciting and imaginative tale of a daring crime by the most unlikely of criminals, a federal district court judge and an interesting cast of accomplices. Fast-paced. Well written. Dialogue is natural, descriptions very readable.But perhaps one of the most interesting facets of the book, at least to those of us that are lawyers, especially lawyers who try cases in front of this district-court-judge/author, James Zagel, is the insight it gives into the workings of the judicial mind."
3,Leaking,Well 2 of the colors leaked a lot when I opened the package. I ended up installing them with gloves on. If I was over the carpet I would have been pretty mad. Never had this happen with with Canon ink. Still gave it 3 stars as it seesm to work well once they were in.
1,Don't work for Canon-i550,"The headline says it all. They just don't work. Canon printers are not all the same. I can't say if these work for some of the other printers that this company sells them for, but I certainly wouldn't trust anything they said about any product they sold. They should know better!"
4,Good refills.,These ink cartridge refills worked fine in my Canon printer. I experienced no problems with them. They were a good bargain.
4,Good Ink,Works fine in my Pixma IP3000. I haven't printed pictures with it. Wear gloves and be careful when installing. I spilled some ink when twisting off the shipping cap.
1,A serious mistake - non recommendable,I would NOT recommend this at all. Quality of print is terrible and for each color print we have to clean my header. The cost is less but entirely waste.
2,No Good,"They leak, the printing color does not come out correct, They print very few pages. Save your money and buy another brand. Sorry The only good think is the price."
5,Good product,"This ink fits my Canon iP3000 printer. Quality ink, but have not used it enough to tell how long it lasts."
4,"so far, so good","I don't use my printer a lot, but so far the cartridge that I installed (black) is doing ok. No problems at all. I haven't needed the color cart yet so I can't comment on that."
3,fun but too many problems,"I really like these crosswords, however there are too many wrong answer glitches. It would also be easier to play by using the arrow and enter keys rather than having to hold down the ctrl key so much."
2,Eh. Pretty schlocky.,"Nothing new or original here. ""Trite"" and ""cliche"" are the order of the day. Maybe read on a plane, or in the toilet. But only if your life is otherwise an empty void."
1,Availability of Rain Fall,"All the reviews place importance on reading Barry Eisler's Rain series in order, however the first, Rain Fall, is not availible in Kindle form in Australia. Think I will give up on trying to read this author due to these regional restrictions."
5,A Gripping Read,"An excellent story with twists and turns that keep the reader entranced. John Rain is a mysterious and fascinating protagonist, and immediately engages the reader with his deep sense of ""honor"" despite his chosen profession. I am eagerly awaiting Mr. Eisler's next book. I am more of the Oprah Winfrey Book Club type of reader, but thoroughly enjoyed this book's action-packed story line and character development."
5,Awesome series!!!,Great series. Every John Rain book has been excellent and leaves the reader wanting more. Great characters and the detailed settings are very well done.
2,The detractors of this novel are right on!,"Initially, I thought it was me. I found it a challenge getting through this thing. It was boring, not much action until the latter part of the book. There was so much discussion about the layout of Tokyo; so much, I truely believe a resident of this city would be confused. All this discussion of streets and subways was obviously intentional but not really necessary. Perhaps, a reader from Tokyo might find it more enjoyable.I have no problem with the plot, however, as stated earlier, be prepared for little action."
5,An authentic taste of modern tokyo,"What struck me within the first 15 pages of this book was not only how accurate the author's description of modern tokyo is but also his grasp of the little nuances that most people living there never pick up on. After living and traveling extensively in Japan, this book felt like reading about home.The authenticity of the location, coupled with the writer's engaging style makes for an excellent read. Before I started reading I was worried it was going to be another psuedo-japanese fiction like 'rising sun', fortunately I was proven utterly wrong. The author has obviously walked the very streets and frequented the very bars he writes so well about, as well as has a solid grasp of the culture, which comes through in some interesting observations made by his main character, John."
1,Ghastly overrated,"Much hype has been made about this series and its protagonist, John Rain, an assassin operating in Tokyo, Japan.But I can't remember the last time a novel had a hero so hard to like or sympathize with in the slightest. Rain remorselessly murders innocent people for relatively small sums of money but then expects us to care for him when he whines about how rough Vietnam was. We're supposed to accept him as slick and unflappable, but he acts like a horny 13-year-old boy around pretty women. Supposedly he is super deadly, but he never once engages in a fight where he doesn't totally outmatch (and subsequently butcher) the competition. And Rain's sudden urge to protect the hot daughter of one of his victims is never explained or written in any remotely convincing way, except to say that he wants to sleep with her.Replete with ultra-dull prose, almost no action, and hopelessly lame descriptions of Japan, this thriller is excitement free, a complete dud."
4,Warning-Graphic Violence and Sex,"This is the first Barry Eisler book I read as part of the Rain series. I checked out the reveiws here and thought this would be a thriller I would likely be interested in. I wasn't disappointed. The book is quite good. However, I was struck by the graphic depictions of the violence (pointedly-Rain is a cold blooded killer even if he is a somewhat likeable hero) and I also found the parts involving Rain's sexual encounters to also be a little too graphic. I am not a prude it is just that there are going to be some out there who will purchase this book for the Kindle and be a little put off or shocked by what they find. I read the second book in the series, Hard Rain, hoping the violence and sex was a little less intense, but it wasn't. You can see my review for that book. I have decided not to read the rest of the series."
2,"OK, but not enough...","John Rain has something in common with John ""Lilly"" Lelankevitch, the main protagonist inEvil, Be Gone. Vietnam left them both skilled but scarred. In Rain Fall, I didn't find Rain's skills demonstrated enough to sustain the interest of the ""action novel"" reader in me and I didn't sufficiently feel the depth of his scarring to become emotionally invested in the story. I will definitely give Barry Eisler another chance to snare me as a fan, but Rain Fall fell short for me."
3,ENTERTAINING!,"Was in the mood for some spy thrillers and I think I have found a good series. Rain Fall was entertaining, novel, with plenty of action. The book went smoothly and quickly and I was certainly entertained by the main character.For a first novel, it whet my appetite for more. Shall order the 2nd in the series. Love series novels."
1,No action - slow read.,"One reviewer commented that you shouldn't start it unless you have all night to read it in one go - implying a roller coaster, non-stop page turner. Hah. Well, reviews like that suckered me in. I kept waiting for something to happen. Or at least to discover a character or situation that was interesting. This was the most boring, uninspired read that I have experienced in a long time. I had to give up on it. Give this one a miss."
2,Hard to get into,"I've read many series about cops or mercenaries, all of which captured my attention at some point. I'm half way through this book and find it torturous to complete. I agree with another reviewer who commented on the constant Japanese/English translation and the depth to which they explore his Japanese heritage to me is not very interesting. There is little action so far which is why I read - entertainment. At some level the entire book up to this point feels like Rain telling his own story to the reader. There has been little dialogue and frankly very few characters. I'm not even sure at this point what the story line is getting at. I'm going to try to choke through to the end, but when I consider other books that I had trouble putting down, well, I have had trouble picking this one up to be brutally honest. I even found myself resort to solitaire to occupy my time... Would not recommend this to a fan of action novels."
4,Well Written and Engaging,"This intelligently-written page-turner thriller is impressive as a first effort. Very engaging, with sympathetic characters well drawn. The lead character's Vietnam War backstory, though, seems artificially injected and carelessly concocted out of a mix of My Lai and Apocalypse Now. Trauma from war experience was an implicit theme in hardboiled detective literature, but I'm not aware that any of those classic noir writers ever felt it necessary to delve into gory flashbacks.Mr. Eisler is a major talent, I'm glad I discovered him, and I intend to read more of his books in the hope that this is not his best work."
3,a good read but..,A good story sometimes mired in too much detail. I personally could have done with out the endless Japanese to English translations . To me they added nothing to the story and quickly became tiresome . Ditto to the endless geography lessons. I could care less which subway line crosses what street and what department store is on the corner of this street and that. I would have preferred that the author stick to the story and trade craft.
3,A different culture...,"is not enough to sustain a reader's interest. Lots of detail about how to follow someone, repeated endlessly. A villian who's left for another day. Not enough to come back for."
4,Good book but....,"This was a suspensful book and very interesting. It got a little repetitive a couple of times with the flash backs but not overly so. I would have given it 5 stars except that I have a hard time with the protagonist being an assassin. Oh well, I suppose that it might be camp these days. If he was an assassin for the ""good guys"", it would have been more palatable to me, but that's just me."
4,Great Book but slow at first,"This book once it got going kept me until the end. Barry Eisler at times did a little too much detail at times, but since this is the first book in the series I can understand it and know why. Great character development and a great plot. Be prepared to not put it down toward the end chapters as it picks up quickly."
5,Arrived quickly and in the condition specified,Arrived quickly and in the condition specified. What more could you ask for?The story itself is great; good airplane reading. I like this John Rain character and plan to read more of Barry Eisler's books in this series.
2,Thumbsdown!,I lost interest in the book. It had a strong start and then went qiuckly to idle. I would not recommend it to friends.
3,"OK, but not great","I read another book by John Rain that was much morere suspenseful and seemed better written. I learned more about Japanese culture, too. Sorry, I don't remember the name of the other book."
4,Not bad for a quick read,"This novel is clever in that it portrays (fairly accurately, I think) what the author believes to be wrong with contemporary Japanese politics. The main character, John Rain, is a former CIA officer of half-Japanese descent that finds himself lost between two cultures - the United States and Japan. Still haunted by his experiences in Vietnam, Rain manages to finally get revenge and put some of his nightmares to rest while falling for a beautiful Japanese jazz pianist, who happens to be the daughter of the politician Rain kills in the opening chapters. Overall, this is not a bad book. It's not a great book either. But if you are looking for a quick read, this book is well written enough that it will keep you interested. Those of you familiar with Tokyo may find this book more interesting."
5,Good as New,This book is used but came to my in perfect shape!! I couldn't ask for more or better service !!!
5,Ronin`s guide to Japan`s dark side,Ronin meets Shogun in this tale of an assassin who specializes in inducing death due to natural causes. Immerses you in Tokyo's culture while putting you into the mind and lifestyle of a master hit man.
3,"Very confusing, but a likable John Rain","As with Hard Rain, all the confusion and description in this book, along with all the Japanese names and speach (translated) do get a bit tedious with time. I've read the later books and am going back to read the first and how the series got started. The characters are well done, and it is well written. It's just not my style of story I'm afraid, so only 3 stars. And I suppose I will keep going now that I've got this far into the series."
3,John Rain in Japan,"I love the John Rain character and all his special abilities but, it was too much Japan. If the Japanese references were a little less and the Japanese expressions less I would read every book written. The action and story line were great."
5,rubbermaid basket,Great item. If you live in Louisanna...you know it gets real muddy. My daughter just puts the shoes and socks in it....go with a hose....and they air dry!!
5,Berry good Goji and Green Tea,I love this product so much I signed up for Amazon to ship a case to me every two months. I love all of Yogi Tea's so far and have ordered several other types to try.
3,Bitter Taste,"I love the flavor of most of the Yogi green teas, my favorites being Super Antioxidant and Triple Echinacea. However, the Green Tea Goji Berry has a noticeable bitter taste that I don't find in the others. I still give this tea 3 stars because it is organic and good for you. But due to the bitter taste, when I finish this box, I'm not buying more. Note, I'm a ""supertaster"" and if you're not a ""supertaster"" you might not have a problem with this tea."
5,Looks well made.,Well I have gone on the recommendations of people with alot more experience than I that this filter is that much stronger. I have used a couple and they seem very sturdy and well made.I have always used Fram rough duty but I was talked into this product I really have no way of knowing if it does everything they say it's supposed to do but I have to go on other peoples knowledge.
5,"One of the best Dick's Picks releases, if not the best one.","It's 1973, it doesn't have Donna, it's not awash in synthesizers and MIDI technology, Jerry's voice is crisp and clear, and it's 4 discs, for less than 25 bucks. You can't go wrong with this."
5,One of the best Dick's Picks,"The versions of Weather Report Suite are alone worth the price of admission on these discs. There is also a really killer version of Morning Dew. This is a great Dick's Pick for people who can actually appreciate the slower stuff by the Dead, and you have to appreciate the slower stuff in order to be a true Deadhead."
5,I saw and knew I wanted it.,"I have a new HP Photosmart 1218 printer and have been looking for a great digital camera to team up with it. At my sons birthday party, I noticed a guest quietly shooting pictures with the Epson 3000Z. A day later I got an E-Mail from him with the download for the pics he took at the party. They came across at 75 DPI and I juiced them to 600 DPI and printed them. At first I thought that the picture quality would be poor because it came over the internet and I juiced the DPI from 75, but the pictures were amazing! I couldn't even imagin them looking any better. If the pics were this great downloaded from a low level DPI, what would original shots look like at higher resoulution? You will absoultly freak out, that's how! Don't buy any other camera until you check this one out. I'm glad I saw this camera being used because I may not even have considered it. What a mistake that would have been. Don't miss this one........."
3,Not useful as a reference guide but ok for entertainment,I bought it for myself but gave it to a professional editor who works for me. I didn't have the patience to read through the text. He found it entertaining but I found the narration too detailed and analytical and the examples too few. Ok for the right audience.
5,Autry Musical,"This movie was a classic western musical. It had the talents of lovely Ann Miller, famous dancer, the fabulous comedy of Jimmy Durante and Gabby Hayes and of course the sweet voice of young Mary Lee. Gene, a radio star, returns to his home town of Torpedo as honorary sheriff for a day and winds up running for a permanent place as sheriff. The bad guys were ruling the town and Gene had to stop them. This was classed as a musical because of the many songs and dance routines, but it was also a classical Autry action movie as only he could make..If you have never been an Autry Fan or seen any of his movies this is the one to start with....Strangly enough, this is the very one that made this Autry collector fall in love with the life and legacy of Gene Autry and I have been collecting since that time....I highly recommend this movie!!!Give it a try and you'll become a fan of America Greatest Singing Cowboy!!"
5,A CHANCE TO MEET ROBIN HOOD,"First of all, a novel that pays homage to E. Nesbit and Edward Eager catches my attention. In your mind's eye imagine going to the library, checking out a seemingly ordinary book---then discovering that it is extraordinary, unlike any book you've ever seen. You can enter the story. You can visit Sherwood Forest and be with Robin Hood. This story idea is brilliant; I tip my hat to Nina Bernstein. She did an incredible job with this. Buy this novel for the young people in your life, they'll love it."
1,Poor sound quality,"I thought this was a good headset, but, after using it, on several calls, people said I sounded faint. I had to move the microphone directly next to my mouth and even that was marginal. I didn't have this problem with my previous headset (I forgot the brand) but had to get rid of it when my dog ate the microphone ..."
3,"Susan Oliver, An Almost Forgotten Actress","Many Sci-Fi fans remeber Susan as Vina, a Star Trek character in the pilot, ""The Cage"". Her book talks about her life as best as she could remember. Readers can feel her struggle through unhapiness. Jerry Lewis tried to tell her that one day she could inspire someone by just being in movies. His Comedy Film ""The Disorderly Orderly"" stars Susan Oliver as Susan Andrews, who suffers from an acting heart and tries to take her life, much like beautiful Susan Oliver in her book. If you like her, try to get a copy of her story. I wish I could have met her."
3,Not sure it is worth the trouble,"I am not a philosopher, and purchased this just out of general interest in the topic. I found it quite tedious to read and not really very accessible to a general audience. There is a great deal of cumbersome philosophical terminology that I found very difficult to navigate. In the end, I did learn something about recent philosophers' views on the meaning of life, but not sure it was worth the time and at times tedium of reading through the entire book."
4,Good book,"As a person with no formal education in philosophy I cannot provide anything approaching a proper critique of this mostly acedemic work. Still, like many, I have wrestled with the question that is the title of this book and, while not a light read, I found this book to be accessible and on point. It is an exploration of the writings of historically significant philosophers who had something of interest to say on this question. Mr. Young applies his formal and informal analysis and criticisms of the varying assertions offered up.There is an endorsement, of sorts, of an insight by Heidegger in the final chapter but you will not walk away from this book with the question put to rest. And rightfully so. Some well-plated food for thought, though, and I plan to read this book again."
5,Great book; loaded with practical ideas,"I have found this booklet really easy to follow and full of information that is relevant to educators, parents and other interested individuals.It appears well supported by research and although they cover numerous points discussed in other books there is also a lot of new and important information as well."
1,!!! I WISH THERE WAS A NEGATIVE STARS !!!,"ANYONE GIVING THIS CD ANY PRAISE IS STUPID. THIS CD IS STUPID. THE LYRICS, ARENT EVEN BAD ENOUGH TO LAUGH AT, ONLY MAKE YOU WONDER WHY? WHY DIDNT THESE GUYS GO TO SCHOOL TILL AT LEAST ""PAST"" KINDERGARDEN. WITH THESE GUYS BASIS OF HUMOR BEING SH!^ AND GIRL JOKES, YOU CAN SWEAR THEIR MATURITY LEVEL IS ABOUT EQUAL TO ONE OF MICHAEL JACKSONS FRIENDS. CMON GUYS, THIS AINT MUSIC, ITS A DRINK COASTER. THANK FOR AT LEAST KEEPING MY TABLE IN GOOD SHAPE."
3,"Uneven, but not without its merits","In some ways, this book deserves 5 stars. The research effort was stellar, and the descriptions of the island and the battlefields really capturing the essence of Guadalcanal. But in other ways, the story was a little rocky. The characters were somewhat 1-dimensional (the All American Boy, the crazy guy, the grizzled sergeant, etc.), the scenes between the action often dragged, and the romantic interest felt very forced. In particular, having the main protagonist responsible for every clever nickname in the campaign was a bit jarring. So overall I give it 3 stars - a little uneven, but it held my interest until the end."
1,"good book, bad presentation","No argument with the other posting re. quality of content BUT: The worst written-to-electronic form in 62 purchases. Presented format is broken up to the point of being unreadable, or nearly unreadable. Not used to decyphering sentence structure this bad, so will limit future purchases if they continue like this."
2,Where's the beef?,"I loved their last book BLUR because it was chock full of decisive, useful insights to leverage the economic change we face. They wrote of Bowie Bonds and other interesting concepts that are just warmed-over in Future Wealth. Future Wealth would make a great essay, but there's not enough new substance for a book. Still, I'll eagerly await their next book, for I know what this duo is capable of."
2,Black tulips for today's market,"Future Wealth is populist, upbeat and a typical product of the latter stages of a booming stock market. It succeeds Blur by the same authors. The good times are going to last for ever, risk should be seen as opportunity, the way to the future is to find ways of borrowing the cash value of your skills and to commit it to the dance. Everyone's a winner, there are no losers (or they don't rate a mention). The book is interesting primarily as an example of shrewd marketing of reassurance into a boom economy."
1,Glib and superficial,This book picks on a couple of transient epi-phenomena of a crazed stock market and interprets them as new verities. But the market is returning to reality as they speak. The authors' attempt to ride the latest intellectual fad has backfired this time since the ideas in this book were obsolete before the book was published.
3,Fabulous thinking - but haven't we heard all that before?,"Although the concept is surely interseting, but I think that the contents are more or less inspired by ""Fture Shock"", ""Net Worth"", and many similar books , most notably customers.com. Overall, I rate it another book on e-economy subject"
2,Light Reading,"This book is interesting but the authors suggest that the Marx theory of ""....taking property out of private hands and giving it to the state........But the corruption of the theory didn't necessarily disprove the underlying thinking."" This is suprisingly shallow thinking when the failure of communism is so rampant worldwide. The underlying thinking of Marx is diaster. The social planning of Daivs and Meyer is evident in thier ""saftey nets"" and calls for socialized medicine.I expected more from this book."
5,Concerning the melding point of musical creativity,"Collaboratively compiled and definitively co-edited by Rene T. A. Lysloff (Assistant Professor of Music, University of California - Riverside) and Leslie C. Gay, Jr. (Associate Professor and Coordinator of Musicology, University of Tennessee - Knoxville), Music And Technoculture collects together fifteen original essays by a variety of learned authors concerning the melding point of musical creativity and the options that technology makes possible to budding musical artists. Transformation of musical creations as well as the staying power and influence of local style form the heart of the insightful and varied discourse in this scholarly anthology of modern changes in music study. Music And Technoculture is an impressive, informative, and highly recommended addition to academic and professional History of Music and Contemporary American Cultural Studies reference collections and reading lists."
5,A must!,"If you are trying to do the Jorge Cruise or any low carb, this is the only book that has the sugars in it."
4,easy to understand & useful,"Loved this book, it is easy to understand & useful. Lots of foods listed that I couldn't find in a few other books."
5,A Must-Have Companion For Dr. Atkins Dieters,"After thumbing through this book at the bookstore, I've decided it's a must-have and will purchase it from Amazon.com. The book will enable any person to be aware of and to track their carb, fiber and sugar consumption anytime and anywhere. It's the most comprehensive food counter currently on the market for Dr. Atkins dieters."
1,Not very durable,"I bought this to replace my wallet and hold my Blackjack. The case is very nice and functional. Unfortunately, it is not very well made. The inner layer of the front cover, where the magnetic catch is located, started separating two weeks after I received the case. After a month, it was no longer useable, because the cover had completely come apart. Very disappointed in this product. It was great when new, but it should last longer than 30 days!"
4,Very fine novel,"Set in pre-WWII Austria, this is the story of Christa; her father, General Helmer; Christa's marriage to an American writer, Lan, and her relationship with Josef, an enigmatic Jew who is working to thwart Hitler's takeover of Europe. Lurking around the edges is Robert, Christa's childhood friend, who becomes a Nazi, and who will either be the the destroyer or the savior of her family.This story is involving from the first page; it's partly a romance, but one with more serious undertones than the usual (given the times in which it's set). It's that rare type of novel where we are given the opportunity to really know these characters--the author lets us into their heads & their lives; no one is left out. The kind of book where after you close it, you say, ""Damn, that was a good read!"" And you wish that the story went on, or that there was a good sequel. If you find it in a used bookstore or your local library, I urge you to read it."
4,viewfinder is out of focus,"I've experimented with this camera 3 times now including a DisneyWorld trip. The viewfinder is out of focus. Sometimes it's hard to find your subject in the viewfinder too. But lo and behold, the pix come out great! Not sure if the viewfinder problem is common but I didn't have time to return it for another. It's definately worth the $90!!!"
4,"Very tasty, good value, would buy again!","I was so happy to find a box of rose Turkish Delight alone--it's my family's favorite flavor. The pieces are a little larger than other imported brands' pieces and they're sweet, firm and tasty."
3,Homedics 6 Point Back Massager w/ Heat,"Great heat option, not so great massage. Still at the price purchased, is a great bargain."
1,DISCREPANCY!,"I'M NOT GOING TO BUY THIS ITEM BECAUSE THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE STATED PRODUCT FEATURES NOR THE PHOTO. THE SIZES DETAILED IN THESE TWO HEADINGS ARE DIFFERENT. PLUS THE PHOTO SHOWS A TWO DOOR UNIT WHILE THE DESCRIPTION NOTES A ""BI-FOLD"" DOOR CONFIGURATION. SO WHICH IS THE CORRECT SPECIFICATIONS AND WHICH DOOR SHOULD BE SHOWN IN THE PHOTO? I'M LOOKING FOR THE UNIT PICTURED WITH THE TWO DOORS AND ONE THAT FITS A MASONRY FIREPLACE OPENING OF 28"" HIGH BY 34"" WIDE.SORRY TO PUT THIS ON THE ""REVIEW"" PAGE BUT YOU DIDN'T PROVIDE A METHOD TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND THE INFORMATION DISCREPANCY."
1,very bad,Every phone I have ever owned or any product I have ever owned from Southwestern Bell breaks in a few months. I will never buy from them again.
1,SouthWestern Bell Freedom Phone,Worst phone I ever bought. Wish I had read the reviews. Constantly losing its security code so you can't dial out on it.
1,Sorry sound quality,"Ouch. I'm returning my GH2400. Audio quality is erratic, and the the volume control can't be adjusted while one is talking (dumb). My Sony 900 mhz is so much clearer."
1,Replacement batteries for this phone are hard to find,I have had this phone for about a year and a half. I have been very happy with the phone's performance until I recently needed to find new batteries. The replacement batteries are a non-standard size and are difficult to find. Most cordless phone batteries consist of 3 or 4 AA-sized battery configs with a jack. Thia phone has a 3-AAA config and I have yet to find - even on directly through SW Bell or on the web. Buyer beware.
2,If you like throwing money away then buy this phone,"We bought this phone at [local store] about a year ago. It worked great for the first eight or nine months and then the battery started to die in the middle of conversations. Now when the phone rings and you pick up the receiver the phone makes a very loud beep in your ear. Many times, when you dial a number for some reason it will only dial the first few numbers, so you are sitting there waiting for the call to go through when in fact it only dialed five numbers. I have to agree totally with the person who said good luck getting a battery. I have searched high and low [local stores] and unless you want to spend [price] on a custom made battery forget it. The SWB website doesn't even list this model.This phone is good for two things. Either take it out fishing with you and use it as a boat anchor, or ... This phone is a joke. Don't waste your time like we did."
5,Fantastic resource.,You can get all the answers you need to get started in this business within this book. It is a great source of information on what steps you have to take to get started and run your business. Includes handy forms that cover all areas of the coffee shop business (and many that I hadn't even considered). Well written and easy to understand.
4,You Should Add This Book to Your Organic Collection,"This second revised edition further enforces, applies, summarizes the concepts in stereoselective synthesis presented in Carey & Sundberg's Advacned Organic Chemistry Part B. Topics include stereoselective catalytic reductions, stereoselective non-catalytic reductions, stereoselective oxidations, stereoselective carbon-carbon formation via nucleophilic addition to carbonyl and via pericyclic reactions. New material has also been added on homogenous diastereoselective hydrogenation, enantioselective oxidations, and, novel chiral auxiliaries. This revised edition includes materials and examples from updated and current research. Organic chemists and researchers should no doubt add this volume to their organic collection."
3,"This ain't the '70s, bird brain","Budgie released some gems 30 years back. ""Never Turn Your Back On A Friend,"" ""In For The Kill"" -- dynamite. ""Bandolier"" -- fantastic. And such fun. Wouldn't it be something if the band's 2006 album, ""You're All Living In Cuckooland,"" sounded like those '70s titles? It would indeed be something -- something inexplicable. Vocal chords have aged. Personnel have changed. We've entered a new century, no less.Budgie have evolved, which of course they'd have to to have a new(ish) album. The new does have some in common with the old. Lots of big guitar. [The new(ish) guitarist, Simon Lees, is good.] Vocals by Burke Shelley -- recognizable, though (understandably) less nimble. Quirky song titles. Interesting cover art. And Steve Williams' drumming.The result is a solid album (3 1/2 stars) and a bit of redemption from Budgie's rather run-of-the-mill recordings in the early 1980s. New feathers. Wings flapping."
4,"Great 1st set, singles","Indeed this is a great pick for 1st set type singles. I personally prefer the jazzier Dead of 1972-1974. But they had long improvised jams in all their incarnations, this just isnt one of those experimental nights I love the Dead for. They are as professional as they ever were here, if not as experimental. I wish the producers had added some tracks from other concerts on this release, as there is PLENTY of unused space on CD's 2 and 3. This is a great pick if you only own a few live releases--but less impressive if you have a big collection of Dead shows."
4,Excellent example of the '77 sound,"i agree with the other reviews that this concert doesn't get the love it so richly deserves. the true gem, i think, is 'He's Gone' on disc 3. that track by itself is worth the price of the cd set. 1977 was a great year for the dead, and gets occasionally ignored, somewhat like 1973 in the wake of the Dead's stellar 1972 campaign. unfortunately, the true gem of 1977 was 5/8/1977 from Cornell U. if you're reading this pondering purchasing vol. 15, without a doubt do so. then, befriend a deadhead and score a copy of 5/8. the two together will keep your ears and imaginations busy for weeks and weeks. you can't go wrong with this cs set.cheers!"
4,Marykate's review,"Yes I love the book because it was more than one story. There were about 36 stories in all, not just one big one. They were more of Halloween stories but they were all good for any time. I had 2 I really loved that I want to tell you about. One of the stories was the ""Golden Arm."" She loved it so much that she told her husband that when she died she wanted to be buried with it. But the husband was thinking what he could do with all that gold.I thing I said just enough but you should read the rest.I would think if you liked to read not too scary books then this is the book for you. It's not too scary, but it is funny."
5,Breathtakingly beautiful,Wondrous and fun photographs that will amaze you. I am going to buy copies for all my nieces for Christmas.
3,intriguing coffee table book,"Almost entirely composed of photographs : amazing microscopic shots of a butterfly wing, limescale, snail's teeth...then aerial shots of river deltas and icebergs...and to me the least interesting section on outer space. A really interesting book to pick up on peruse but I'm not sure you'd go back to it much after an initial browse"
4,"Awesome book, Buy the hardcover","I bought this book for my wife, and the pictures are amazing. You really can't go wrong with something this fantastic. The biggest problem is the binding is garbage - hence the 4 stars - on the paperback. After looking through it ONCE, it is already falling apart. Worth the extra couple of bucks for the hardcover."
5,Heaven and Earth - What a fantastic book,"This book contains one of the best set of images I have ever seen. There are pictures of different subjects on a whole variety of scales and colours, which are fantastic design sources for many arty/crafty people who lack inspiration for various projects. Some images are unidentifyable and are impossible to understand without reading the blurbs - I spent a while guessing what some of the pictures were & quite often got them completely wrong. It's one of those books which make you realise that you are glad that you cannot see to microscopic levels, especially of bedbugs & flies etc..! Well worth getting & some amazing photography."
4,Great images,"All of the images in this book are noteworthy; some are truly spectacular. The only thing that the various images have in common is that the images cannot be seen by an unaided human eye; the images span from the microscopic to astronomic. Considering the quality of the images in this book, it's too bad that the paperback version is so small (under 9x6). Given the quality of these images, the larger size of the hardback would have been well worthwhile the slightly higher price."
2,BORING!,"This CD was sort-of boring. All though I like her music, I have to admit this CD was not very good. I mean she doesn't sing or perform. It was a real waste of money, sorry Whitney I'm not trying to be mean."
3,Searching for the perfect Egyption Musk,"I have been using a particular Egyption Musk product for several years, however, they have changed the formula, and I have been searching every company that makes Egyption Musk for the scent I fell in love with.This product is close, but not exactly what I was looking for.The service and feedback from this company is superb, and I commend the professional way they handle problems such as this. Unfortunately, my initial review was for the musk itself, not the company, they deserve an A+ for customer service.Thank you for the opportunity to right a wrong I made.Susan Alicea"
3,Weak,"Based on the sample I got with my order, it smells nice enough. Like a grassy musk. But the strength is so weak, I would never buy it."
1,"FOR THE LOVE OF DOLLY,.","I bought this dvd,and I am so disappointed on how this was done,I thought it would be much better than a bunch of crazed over weight Dolly fans runnung all over the place. I called New York ABC television once when they did the Dolly show on getting some items,and the guy told me (THAT SHIP SAILED ALONG TIME AGO). Also this dvd dosent show the real Dolly fan that had everything thing from the 60's that use to follow Dolly everywhere,and actually had the first fan club. Margo Dowdy,is the name. I do not understand who claims to know so much yet knows so little on the real Dolly Fan. Margo took awsome photos,and owned really rare items,she dyed at the age of 90,and everyone in Tazwell Virginia knew her for all the Dolly stuff she had. No one knows where or what happened to the rare collection. Id love to own it,for it was a treasure trove. Dolly knew Margo."
4,REMEMBERED WELL,"IF YOU LIKE MUSIC THEN YOULL LOVE THESE CLASSIC SONGS BACK FROM THE YESTER YEARS WHICH REALLY WASNT TO LONG AGO,ITS FULL OF CLASSIC ARTISTS YOULL ALL REMEMBER IF YOUR A GARAGE FAN,ALL THE FAVES ARE HERE,PERSONALLY IVE NEVER HEARD OF A MORE BETTER ALBUM PUT TOGETHTER THAN THIS,BELIEVE ME IT WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO SOME GOOD GOOD TIMES,YOULL BE A FOOL TO MISS IT.!! THERES SOME TUNES ON HERE YOULL LUV,AND HATE BUT HEY WE CANT HAVE IT ALL OUR OWN WAY CAN WE,THE BEST THING MOW IS FOR YOU TO LISTEN AND FOR ME TO BE QUIET , ENJOY."
1,fake product,"Greenweb has sent the product of another producer, that's not nearly the same as Durex, something cheap and with no label at all ????? WTF guys ????"
4,Spice things up!,Worth the investment. Maybe could be a little cheaper since they are only single use.
1,Mood KILL!,"Three out of six of these didn't work. How better to kill the mood than having to fumble around for not one, not two, not three, but FOUR before you find one that works. I would not buy these ever again. They are not cheap, yet the quality is very cheap. I should write Durex and get my money back.Don't let this happen to you."
2,No Great Shakes...,"My boyfriend and I tried these and were both underwhelmed. The novelty is fun the first time, but, they're a kind of a nuisance after a while. They are what they advertise, they're just not all that fun or stimulating. I don't recommend these."
5,WOW!!! I LOVE THIS!,"I have tried other ""plastic"" toys and have found them to be to big and to much work. This one works great!! It is so easy to use and is small enough that you can place it in ""just the right spot""!!! I do like the fact that it is disposible and is ""sanitary"". No more cleaning afterwards!! The price may be a little high, but there are so many positives that I cannot complain to much. Thanks. My husband and I are really pleased and will continue to be a return customer."
1,Don't waste your money on these...,2 of them didn't even work when we finally got them out of the package. 2 more turned on and off unexpectedly. So that left about 2 good ones that actually worked. I thought they were overpriced anyways but after 4 of them weren't even fully functional they were definintly not worth the money.
4,Love it,I moved to this camera from an APS autofocus camera... what a difference! Not only is the film processing much less expensive (the price never came down on processing) but the photos are stunning. I am excited about learning how to get even better photos with the right filters.
4,Great First RC Car!,"My son got this for Christmas and he loves it. It doesn't go so good on carpet, but it's great on other surfaces. After just a few minutes of demonstration my 21 month old was pushing the controller himself. Every time he plays with it he gets a little better at steering it. He even has learned the word ""drive"" because of it. He just loves this toy and wants to play with it all the time."
4,"Good ""first"" remote car","This is a very durable and great ""starter"" remote control car. It is pretty easy to control and even though it isn't for big kids, it is great for that first remote control experience."
4,A fun toy,"I bought this for my 3 year old daughter, she likes it a lot. However, to turn is quite difficult too control."
1,Disappointed...,"As a fan who has been enjoying McCaffrey's stories for over 10 years, I found this book to be far below what I've come to expect from her writing. The various series she has published - from Pern, The Rowan, Crystal Singer, Dinasour Planet, even Freedom and Brain Ships - are all well written and utilize a similar style and level of competence. The stories on Acorna, however, seem to be written by someone else entirely (her son, perhaps?). I don't know how to describe it other than by saying it is far below her usual standards, with childish dialogue, nonexistant plot, and flat characters. If you don't like this book, don't give up on her; go read one of her other series (Dragonsinger is a great intro to the world of Pern), because she really is a talented writer."
3,Not bad.,"I read these books out of order. You really do need to read them in order, it gets confusing if you don't."
5,Loved it.,"Being a long standing fan of Anne McCaffery, I had to try this book. I wasn't sorry that I did! I've loved her Pern books and this was just as great. If you love fantasy, you WILL love this book!)"
2,"Choppy, disconnected, but still interesting","Acorna was an interesting story populated with characters you could invest in and a ""message"" (the evils of child labor/slavery) but it was choppy and, in my opinion, poorly written. It lacked a sense of flow and the story-line felt like it wasn't quite finished or filled in. After reading it, I wondered if Anne McCaffrey was a bit overrated. I have since read some of her Dragonriders of Pern novels and found that she can write great stories. But as for Acorna, I really wouldn't recommend it when there are so many other tales that one could be reading instead."
1,Waste of my time,"I wanted to like this book. I wanted to say that I read an Anne McCaffrey book and enjoyed it. I got about a third of the way through it, and the story hadn't really gone anywhere...so I shelved it. I don't plan to go back and finish reading, which is unusual for me."
2,Lower reading level than expected,This is a good series in itself but I found that it had a much lower reading level than many of Anne's other books. This would be a good read for someone in junior high and could be considered boring to someone beyond this reading level.
2,Disappointing,"I have read and enjoyed most all of Anne McCaffrey's books and was sorry this was such a disappointment. The characters were shallow and often their actions didn't make sense. The idea for the story seems like it ought to be good, but the realization is lacking."
2,The Unicorn Girl ( Acorna),This book was surprisingly disappointing. The author is well known and well loved for good reasons. However the main chracter was poorly developed. It was difficult to feel much empathy for her. The plot was good and the conflicts clear. However a friend of mine said it was like reading a book without a main character. I agree.
4,Not suitable for pre-teens; good light reading for others,"I am a big McCaffery fan, and read these books with interest, but unfortunately not before I had given a set to a 12-yr old girl relative. Had I done so, I would not have given them as a gift.These books have some pretty strong sexual connotations and situations not suitable for pre-teens, including references to child abuse, prostitution, exploitation and s-m practices including very suggestive dialog between unsavory characters.For more mature readers, they are an entertaining though unchallenging adventure."
4,Interesting,"A excellent book with just the right amount of suspense. The uncle of one of the men who rescue her, is an amusing character. He wants to ""collect"" Acorna to add to his collection of unusal things. What happens is most interesting."
2,Not up to the standard of either co-author,"I expected better from both Anne McCaffrey and Margaret Ball. While there were some scenes that resonated emotionally (the opener with Acorna's parents, the first meeting with the children in the mine) on the whole it felt very formulaic. A number of the characters were cardboard and much of the plot seemed predictable. This book gives me no reason to look for the sequels."
3,"Good, up until the end anyway","This book had wonderful characterization and a strong plot. However, the end of this book came too quickly. It was mostly resolved within a short amount of pages, which made the conclusion seem almost to be written by a different author. The ends were tied up a little too quickly and neatly, and that didn't leave much to base the sequel on. If you can deal with that, you'll like this book."
2,Unsatisfying.,"I have long been a McCaffrey fan, gobbling up the Pern series and the other series she has done with a variety of collaborators, but this is one I won't pursue. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot predictable, and the dialog stilted. I'm sorry, Anne, you blew this one. Better luck next time."
4,Acorna: Unicorn Girl,This novel is a very good story. It held me enthralled as I paged through the adventures of Acorna and her commrades. I would recommend this book to any McCaffery fan.
5,Insight and Intelligence,"This is a truly unusual biography. Written with insight and perception, Ruth Lord's protrayal of her father lead her to an understanding of him that she never had when he was alive. That any adult child could write of a parent with such objectivity is really remarkable.The world of wealth and privilege comes with responsibilites and obligations. H.F. du Pont met his but not without personal hardship. As as a child who was never supposed to amount to anything, H.F. left lasting accomplishments in the world of the decorative arts, dairy breeding and horticulture. A fascinating story of a remarkable man, this is a book well worth reading."
1,Doesn't even deserve half a star,"I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor, but this ""movie"" left me stunned in my chair.It's so bad that it could just not have been any worse. Not once did I laugh at the sadly attempted jokes in this movie. I have watched and enjoyed several parodies of big movies, but unfortunately this one will allways be the one I remember best - in my nightmares.The only reason anyone should want to watch this, is if they want to enter a coma for a brief period of time.Oh, and this is the SINGLE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!"
1,Life's too short to waste time watching this junk,"Frankly, one star is a little too generous - it represents more times than I smiled, let alone laughed, at this dreadful film. The situations are forced, the script lame and the acting a fast-track to an also-ran career. As a spoof, the plot soon became tiresome.....go watch Pulp Fiction again if you've got a couple of hours spare - there's a lot more laughs in it for a start."
1,"wow, this was REALLY bad","Despite three good lines and some significant talent, this cutesy, in-joke-laden Tarantino send-up was dull, self-satisfied and for the most part a waste of time. I've nothing against movie violence, but I can't STAND to see jokes beaten to death--especially when they're resurrected again and again to REALLY be driven into your skull. For all its hip insider-ness, the humor is broad enough that even a ten-year-old would find most of it too obvious. The nun sequence seems to violate the space-time continuum as it goes on forever, the Walken impersonations were funny ONCE, and the Natural Born Killers resurrection at the end will make this the longest 82 minutes you're likely to find outside of a Kenny G. album."
1,Worst ever!,"This is by far the worst movie i have ever seen. Its been a few years since I saw it and nothing has come close since then and i doubt that there ever will be a movie produced that is as bad as this. It tries to make fun of a variety of different movies, for example 'Nell' (!) and instead of funny its just pathetic. Whatever you do, don't rent or buy this garbage and if someone throws it at you....turn around and run the other way!! I'm a huge Pulp Fiction fan by the way and have watched that movie a couple of times. Still waiting for the Pulp Fiction special edition DVD to come out."
4,"Worth watching if you're a fan, otherwise....","Funny, entertaining, but basically a sketch, not a movie. If you're a Paul Dinello fan, you gotta see it. If you don't know the comics already, you may be a little non plussed. Download it, it's worth a few bucks. :-)"
3,ha ha funny,"Plot is similar to Pulp Fiction. Includes parodies of Nell (starring Jodie Foster), Natural Born Killers (starring Woody Harrelson), and Resevoir Dogs (starring Harvey Keitel). I like Julie Brown and it's pretty funny. Not worth the price [...]"
1,This Movie Just Isn't Funny,"I rented this movie expecting it to be hilarious. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs are two of my favorite movies, and I also saw Natural Born Killers and Forrest Gump. Some of the visual scenes (such as the Reservoir Nuns receiving their identities) will cause you to smile, but the movie is plagued by a poor script, some bad actors (the actors portraying the main characters from Natural Born Killers were the only good ones) and about 95% of the jokes are just not funny. This movie was painful to watch and incredibly disappointing."
4,hey publisher listen-up!!!!!!!!,"A dictionary should be an edited volume with multiple authors. That volume does not exist yet. Blackwell just published ""A companion to Hegel"" which is a masterpiece. They should employ those same editors and writers and compile a proper dictionary. ""A COMPANION TO HEGEL"" is the best volume on Hegel to date. Blackwell should follow that methodology and get a proper dictionary ""out there""........."
4,Not bad,"I obtained a copy of this book as a required text during my physical therapy education. It did a pretty good job of simplistically explaining the role of the heart and lungs in health and what happens (technically) when problems arise. This was a good reference book for hardcore scientific facts and it is specifically targeted at the rehabilitation disciplines. If that is what you are looking for, this book will be the one you need."
1,Missing information,"This is yet another one of the Great American Western offerings that has no product information available. The cover art indicates that two discs are included, yet product data say it's one disc. The price is double that of a one disc product - but, again, which movies are included?"
4,Practical Microsoft SQL Server 7,"I thought the book was very good for beginning users. I found especially useful the Introduction to SQL Chapters and the planning chapters. Including a CD with some sample tutorials would be very beneficial. Overall, if feel the book did a good job on SQL."
4,Good book but you need to experiment with substitutions,"I wanted a book that would give me ideas about how to cook without sugar - the proportions one would need of a liquid ( of any sort) that would replace dry sugar in a recipe. I have not used the sweetener the author uses but substitute what I can find - i.e. apple butter, fruit sweetner from Black River in Mississauga, Ont, Canada (comes in small 500 ml sizes for about $5.00 bottle)and the recipes have turned out very nicely. I would love to try her sweetener too but oh well..This book was a good introduction to how to cook without sugar- if you like experimenting with anything sweet that is not straight sugar. You just need to be a little inventive and use her proportions!"
2,"Fruit-Sweet and Sugar-Free: Prize-Winning Pies, Cakes, Pastr","I too was disappointed in this cookbook. I bought it with the same assumption as the other disappointed woman who submitted a review of 2 stars. The fruit sweetner is is sold as a commercial made product only and not for the average consumer in mind. You can order it through a natural food store, but you have to purchase a case of 4 gallons at $35.00 per gallon. Obviously this is not something the average home can afford to buy nor store. She does offer the options of substituting fruit juice concentrates for the fruit sweetner, but she doesn't tell you which ones to use in place each recipe. Ex. Do you you use apple, white grape, orange or a combination of these for a particular recipe. Also she recommends to cook down the fruit juice concentrates before using them. This is time consumming and not beneficial to a family on the go. I would like for her to rewrite this book for the average consumer in mind."
2,Disappointing...,"I bought this book thinking it would be a healthy and tasty way to cut down on sugar. After I got it and read through the Introduction and the recipes, I realized the author calls for the use of a concentrated fruit sweetener that is very hard to get. She buys her supply in 1,500 pound shipments from a fruit processing company in California. I don't think too many people have access to something like that without a lot of trouble and expense. The recipes looked delicious, though. There are a few that do call for frozen juice concentrates. I just wish I had found a cookbook that was made for real people instead of professional bakers."
3,Beautiful but ergonomically disasterous,"Beautiful and weighty, this set is beautiful to behold but ergonomically disasterous. The slippery design, coupled with the weight, easily slips out of your hand. While the slim orthogonal lines are eleagant, it is difficult to grip and use, especially when balancing several things (e.g., utensils, plate, cup) at once. The weight of the utensil lies in the handle (rather than evenly distributed or at the center). The kids have a difficult time handling it and consequently hate using it."
2,Quality Control...was left out of the interpretation,"I suppose my interpretation to Good does not equate to what is rated as good. I thought the book was ""well used"" to say the least and I am glad I am taking the course online because it looks like I bought it at a garage sale for a dollar and even that was too much money. Please be honest. For the price of what I received, it was not a deal. I was over charged."
3,Tedious Tale of a Young Wizards Journey to Magical Maturity,"I have never read any of the other books in the Recluse series, but I found the fantasy world and the themes interesting. As for plot, however, the novel was painfully tedious and slow moving. The book chronicles young Cerryl's journey to adulthood in pages and pages worth of unnecessary detail. The other main flaw is that there is a preponderance of references and hints that are never resolved at the end. Some of this makes sense because the next book continues Cerryl's story, but many of the lose ends are too minor and occur far too early in the story to provide a good carry over to the next book. I did enjoy the novel enough while I was reading, but I was left rather dissatisfied."
5,The White Order,This book was great. I loved the emphasis on the White side of the story. It makes you think that the 'bad guys' are not all bad. It let you understand both sides to the story and more fully enjoy the series.
5,Upholds the proud tradition of the series,"Hey, if you've been following the series up to this point, there's absolutely no reason to stop now. A fun, absorbing tale from the perspective of the Whites that holds true to the high standards of the earlier books. If you haven't read the earlier books, this is still a good place to jump in, since knowledge of prior events isn't required."
3,"Good, but it left me hanging...","OK, so who exactly, killed Cerryl's parents and more importantly, who slagged his Aunt and Uncle while they were out sheepherding on some remote, mis-begotten moor? And oh, by the way, who really sent those two guys down in the sewer to kill Cerryl?I will presume that Modesitt will answer these qustions in the next book but I've got an uneasy feeling that just possibly, he won't. The book is just not that tightly constructed. After all, he kind of left the Magic Engineer dangling, didn't he?If there is a sequel, he's got some serious plot devices to figure out. One, we already know how Jeslik(sp?) gets his bottom fricaseed (unless my memory fails me). Two, we know that Fairhaven gets nuked by Justen. So where does the Cerryl line go?But all in all, an enjoyable book. And I love those craftsman/shop details! Gimme more! END"
1,Unusable stickers,"This book is an excellent concept but a heartbreaking failure. Your child may assemble trains of stickers by placing stickers of engines, coaches and freight cars on pages showing tracks and colorful interesting backgrounds. The stickers curl. They will not stay on the pages. Some scenes cross the binder leading to awkward placement of stickers across it. The book cover deceives. The stickers are bordered in white. My child was trilled to have this book, but after several hours, it was trash. This is a shameful production of a great idea."
2,Disappointing quality and design,"I was disappointed with this product even with the reasonable price. The stickers curl. The sizes of the cars are such that it is almost impossible to create a decent length of train since the binding in the center inevitably ends up in the middle of a car. An engine, one car, and a caboose won't typically fit on one side of the page. While the stickers do peel off--sort of--they don't stick well the first time, much less the second time. I would skip this one. There are better options."
1,Poor Quality/Not Worth the Price,"Yikes, this is a poor quality item. Penguin should be ashamed to have this item represent the Grosset & Dunlap brand in the marketplace.The stickers are backed with such poor quality low-tack adhesive that they curl up and are useless as soon as you remove them from the die-cut.In fact, I'd say this product is designed only to separate Granparents and parents from their money. Obviously, this item was never intended for actual use."
3,Alexander's Adventures?,"I've enjoyed most of Lloyd Alexander's non-fantasy- what I'll call ""Fredonia"" (in deference to the Marx brothers) adventures. This one seemed to ring a little too close to *The Prisoner of Zenda*- a wonderful story in its own right. Go to the original"
2,Confusing,I think that the book The Beggar Queen is a little confusing because its just that like all of a sudden a character pops up out of no where. ANd i really dont understand it! i have to take a test on it tomorrow and i really dont understand it and i am having to read a HALF of the book tonite then skimmin and scannin it ... so yeh~~Katie
1,Stick to the original!,"There is only one Barry Manilow.Don't waste your time and money on this CD. Besides Barry's voice, what made these songs so unique and successful in the 70s were the original arrangements and orchestrations, which of course these versions don`t really measure up to."
2,Somewhat disappointing.,"One should really be made aware of the following:1.The DVD may have been issued in 2006,but the film dates from 1994.2.The aspect ratio is 4:3.3.The picture quality is rather poor.In fact the only saving grace is the quality of Solveig Larsen's singing.Although the commentary is in german,with no english subtitles,for the scenic delights of Norway's western coast,from Bergen to The North Cape,I would thoroughly recommend the Golden Globe title 'Hurtigruten'.This is a 98 minute film,issued on,region free,Blu-Ray,and available from Amazon.de.The scenery is absolutely stunning."
4,System requirements,"In response to the review above, here are the system requirements for 1914: The Great War from the JoWood website:* Pentium III 600 MHz or compatible* 128 MB RAM* 3D Videocard* Windows XP/ME/2000/98"
2,Purple unicorn,"Trying to find this game anywhere is like looking for a purple unicorn. This game was high on my list but as the previous reviewer states, information is scarce."
4,Truck,This is a Christmas present so I haven't seen this toy yet. It appears to be a good quality and should provide fun and also imagination for my 3 year old grandson.
1,Not happy about the drill being inoperable!,"This toy would have been pretty cool for my 4 year old, however upon opening it as one of his birthday presents, we put batteries in the power drill the most exciting thing about the toy only to discover it will only go in one direction. The other direction on the toy has no response. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I would not recommend this seller nor the toy because of the disappointment on my sons face when it didnt work properly. Also it was not in its original packaging which leads me to believe it was returned and then repackaged and sold to me."
4,2.5 year old cant get enough,My son plays with this over and over..he loves it! only reason I did not give it 5 stars is if the screws get on to tight the drill does not have enough power to get them out.
5,a big hit!,"We bought the 4x4 Battat Take Apart toy for our 4 year old nephew, and he loves it! I am buying one for my 2.5 year old son for Christmas. The drill is so cool - they can actually build stuff with an actual working tool. Definitely a favorite toy!"
5,Great value,"Our 3-year old grandson understood right away that it came apart and that he could put it back together. He did need to learn how to use the ""power"" tool (which attachment for a screw or a bolt), and how the parts fit together, but the toy kept him fully interested while he worked through that. His 6 and 7 year old sisters liked it too."
4,Fun toy for 3 year old,"I bought this toy for a friend's child after my son received this for his birthday. It's a great toy, that really works on hand/eye coordination. The parts are big enough for little hands to manage. The concept of the drill being able to screw in and out is a little too difficult for my three year old, but it will come with time. I think this is a creative toy that is good quality. I'd highly recommend it for any three year old."
4,My son loves the drill the best.,"At first we were confused on how to put it together, but I think that the lack of sleep on Christmas Eve and the amount of toys to assemble on Christmas Day had us worn out. After looking at it again, it was pretty easy! My 3.5 year old loves putting the car together, but I think that he likes the drill the best. He loves just using the drill on other stuff and ""fixing"" things!"
4,"Fun, but...","This is a really fun toy for our three year old. He likes taking it apart and putting it back together. As with a number of the other reviews, my big complaint is with the drill. The forward and reverse do not work as easily as they could and he has trouble moving the direction from reverse to forward. He ends up using mostly a manual screwdriver that came with another toy set."
2,Only Great in Theory,"Grandson loved this toy for the whopping 4 hours it lasted. The ""clutch"" went out of the screwdriver and now only works in reverse. It's a great toy idea, but what a disappointment for a little one. Called customer service with the company and have yet to hear back. Very disgusted."
5,Princess Puzzle Book,My daughter absolutely loves doing the puzzles and then reading the story that corresponds to each puzzle. It's added a little excitement to her usual 'bedtime story' routine.
2,Pieces do not stay in the book,"We bought this book for our 3 year old daughter for a flight as a ""convenient"" way to carry a bunch of puzzles in one book. She liked the book well enough, but there is one major problem: the puzzles that are embedded in the pages of the book don't stay in the book. As a result, if you finish one puzzle and turn the page to go to the next puzzle, it is pretty likely that the just-completed puzzle from the previous page will spill all over the place. This flaw makes the book completely useless almost immediately (at least in its book form). The only real remedy is to put the puzzle pieces in containers once you are done, which basically defeats the point of the book format.The puzzles are nice and pretty, but be prepared for frustration when the completed puzzles don't stay in the book."
5,Puzzle pieces falling out? Not a problem!,"My daughter has been crazy about jigsaw puzzles since she was 2 and half years old. She just got interested in Disney princess before she turned 3. She received this puzzle book for her 3-year-old birthday and has been constantly asking for it. I was not happy with the design at first when the pieces fell out after she had turned the page, but I came up with my solution right away. I closed the book with all the puzzle pieces where they should be, and opened it to the page my daughter wanted to work on and used a large(about 2"" wide) binder/paper clip to hold the previous pages. This way, no puzzle pieces will fall out and no clean-up required. We likes this system and yes, parental assistance is required -- a yound child does not have enough strength to handle a binder clip that size. Another option is to use one or two large rubber bands to bundle previous pages together. I hope my ideas help!"
2,"good idea, bad execution","Looks like you are getting your money's worth, but in reality, the pieces fall out once you do it. So, all the pieces end up in a baggie, and your kid has to sort through to figure out which pieces are for which puzzle."
5,Highly Recommended,"My 3 year old LOVES this book; she got it for Christmas!!! She is very into the Disney Princesses and loves for us to read to her and look at books by herself. She does the puzzles in this book at least once a day, and we read her the story on the opposite page. At first, we needed to do the entire puzzle with her, but now she is able to separate the border pieces from the center puzzle pieces, and she can do 85% of the puzzle all by herself!! We have had no problems with the pieces falling out of the book; we've had no problems at all!!"
2,"Daughter loves it, but cleaning up is a nightmare!","The puzzles are great and a lot of fun for my two-year old. She loves anything 'princessy' so the princesses were a big selling point. However, after she did each puzzle a couple of times, the pieces didn't stay in the book. When we'd flip the page, all the pieces from that page would fall out. We ended up taking all the pieces out and putting them in a container, which is not the point of the book at all! At least the backs of the pieces are colored specifically for one puzzle in the book, and my daughter gets practice at sorting her colors for half an hour before we can play with her puzzles."
4,Great Soap for the Price,This is a great soap for the price. It allows me to get a great shave and does not dry out my skin like other shaving products. The only shaving prep that I like better is Tom's of Maine shaving cream.
1,My rating has nothing to do with the product...,"...but the outrageous amount I was charged for shipping. Which I didn't find out from the seller until I couldn't cancel. I wanted to buy one bar to try, and the shipping for this item was almost double the cost. STAY AWAY!"
1,Colonel Ichabod Conk Amber Glycerine Bar Shave Soap 2.25 Oz.,A lot a people have been having problems with CacheBeauty. My problem was the Shipping & Handling. The product was great. I've converted over to shaving bars from gel. The main reason I like the bar is that there's no guessing of the amount of gel. I always put way too much on and wasted almost a 1/4 of the can.----------Shipping & Handling of CacheBeauty.Standard (3-7 days) $8.80 (Order Total: $12.30)Expedited (1-3 days) $19.80 (Order Total: $23.30)
1,Shipping and Handling,"It's a fine product, but the Shipping and Handling was not worth it. Try to find it elsewhere, or try a different product. For the record, this is a great soap that last a very long time."
2,Ripped off,"""I should have read the other reviews...I can't believe what this vendor charges to ship a bar of soap that cost $3.50. I paid $4.50 via USPS in shipping charges which clearly leaves me with that ripped off feeling. Amazon should really look at this vendor and their ethics practices. There was no where in the order process that spelled out such an outrageous shipping. Don't order from this vendor...if you do...just bend over and get screwed"""
5,A dialogue of the great masters by an imaginative author.,"I highly recommend ""Lightening Fast Enlightentment"", a compilation of the wisdom of the world by a searcher for the truth who intersperses these gems with excellent prose that binds all together into an interesting story. What makes this book different from the others with similar intentions is the dialogue between great masters on subjects chosen by their enduring dilemma for mankind. I look forward to more from this imaginative author, especially the use of his own creative prose. The format of beginning with a story reminiscent of pre-celtic myths and legends of Ireland, Scotand, Cornwall and Wales is very effective and engaging.Leon I. Hammer, M.D.Author of: Dragon Rises-Red Bird FliesChinese Pulse Diagnosis: A Contemporary Approach"
1,Stolen quotes,I found and this book was one of the worst books I have every opened.It was so bad the I think that any college student could have written a story stealing quotes from bugs bunny would have been better.I recently met the author in NY and he is very odd.
5,Interview with Gary Zukav,"This is an hour-long interview Gary did with New Dimensions Radio, and it is excellent. Anyone who is enthusiastic about Gary's ideas and Gary himself will enjoy it."
3,butterfly tattoo,i like a cuple of songs that i have herd. i like the beet of the songs. the lerics are good and my dad might like it so i have somthing that parents wold find it exeptable.
4,Great Music,"I think that this cd was pretty cool, I like ""Loves got a hold on me"", ""Arcadia"", and the aong Annie. I like the different and neat lyrics to these songs. I liked how the rhythm was put in. I thought it was neat how they took the wine names and out them into Arcadian. The cover was lifelike with the Butterflies. It goes with the title good. I think that some songs I would listen to all the time, and others are just not my type. That's true on all the cds I listen to. This music is for all different types of music lovers."
4,LED flashlights are the best,"I really have a love of LED flashlights in all sizes and functions. I love my Photon II Microlight, but this Streamlight is a great price for some basic features. Carry it in my car for emergencies where I want to make sure I have a working flashlight over time. Love that it actually has an on/off switch and that you don't turn the lense to power it on."
2,Bright but fragile - Fixed under warranty,This flashlight gives a bright light when it works but one drop on a carpeted floor and it's dead. Contacting Streamlight I found out that it has a lifetime warranty. I took it to an authorized repair center. It was promptly fixed at no cost.This is an edit of a previous post. I would like to change the star rating to 4 stars but didn't see a way to do it.I am purchasing a second flashlight as a backup in case I have trouble again.
3,Flashlight is.................meh,"This is the second one of these flashlights I have purchased. The first is excellent as a rugged tool box light, durable and waterproof. The second arrived DOA with a faulty tailcap switch. This seems to be a recurring problem as stated by another reviewer. I still recommend it but keep the box and paperwork in case you need to send it back. Good thing Amazon has such a great return policy."
5,"Strong beam, great battery life","I have owned mine for a year now, and I am very pleased with this flashlight. It has a strong beam, relatively compact, and I have yet to use up the 4 AA batteries. After a big storm, we were without power for 2.5 days and I used this flashlight quite a bit. I dropped it several times and the LED lights did not go out. This would not have been the case with incandescent bulbs."
5,Throw away your old flashlights!,"I can't imagine why anyone would purchase an incadecent bulb flashlight after trying one of these. Compared to any other flashlight I've owned, the light is brighter and clearer than anything else. I'm thinking of buying the larger version of this flashlight in the future.It sounds like a few people got defective units and wrote poor reviews, but I doubt very many of these are defective."
2,Dim light that lasts a very long time!,"If you want a dim flashlight that lasts for a very long time, this is the light for you. For the price, the level of illumination is very poor. I have two single led flashlights that put out significantly more light than this ""7-led"" light. Save your money!"
3,"Powerfull Light, not Long Range","I have to say I expected a better product, yes it has a long runtime life with the batteries (I use Sony 2300mAh rechargeable) but I was expecting a strong light with a strong light range (it{s too short), anyway I bought it all the way from colombia, Next time I'll buy the streamlight Xenon not the Led's One"
2,Bad ergonomics,"I've had this for several months and have not been very pleased with it. My frustration started on the first day, putting in batteries. There's no clue whatever on how to orient the batteries! Eventually I figured out that you need to put two in facing one direction and the other two facing the other way. (Maybe this is supposed to be obvious, but it wasn't to me!). The light is quite dim, even compared with other LED lights (my 2-AA Princeton LED headlamp is much brighter). My biggest complaint is the placement of the switch, at the back end. A flashlight is meant to be held in one hand, and turned on and off with the thumb. You can't do that with this: it's a two-hand operation to hold it and turn it on and off. Poor design!"
1,Bad contact - poor quality,This product worked well for a bout one year then stopped working because of a bad contact. The light would intermittently work when used at a certain angle.
1,Works great until it stops,I have two of these lights and three bulbs burned out on one and four bulbs burned out on the other. It was a nice light until the bulbs burned out after minimal use.
1,Warning,"After a year of non-friquent use, the lighbulbs (3 of 7) started flickering. It is impossible to work under such a flashlight."
1,Dangerous when used with rechargeables. Misleading,"Be careful when you buy this light. I never saw any warnings before I bought two of them. Product listing at Amazon only saysStreamlight 68202 4-AA Battery 7-LED Flashlight, Yellow by StreamlightBut in the fine print that comes with the packaging it says this light should only be used with alkaline AA batteries - not rechargeables.I never read that and put in eneloop rechargeables in one light, energizer rechargeables in the other.The power draw causes rechargeable AA batteries to overload and leak acid. Buy at your own risk.This should be clearly written in the product description for all to read before they purchase."
1,There are better options,"I have been a Streamlight user for years, and have an 30 year old SL-20 that still works. The Streamlight LED flashlights are poorly made. These LED flashlights fall within a couple of years, and the cost to repair exceeds a new light. The switches are the weak link, the contacts fail or the switch itself fails, and is not covered by the Streamlight lifetime warranty. There are better, brighter products from companies such as Maglight."
2,quality concerns,"The flashlight did not work. I reloaded the batteries, tried different batteries, and then reloaded the original batteries. It finally worked after the fourth battery loading. Who knows why. I wouldn't depend on this item unless you have a good backup or else your need isn't critical."
5,Outstanding Flashlight,"Very will made and waterproof. I use this model light on a saltwater fishing boat for the crew. They hold up very well in tough conditions. Just the right size to fit in a jacket pocket, and provides a good broad beamed light for use on the deck or in the cabin/cockpit.I've bought 9 of these lights over the last 2 years with no failures."
1,"Okay for residential but not for heavy-duty, everyday use!","I have gone through three Streamlight flashlights at work. In the begining, the flashlights performed as good as expected. But after a while, the flashlights started to flicker on and off. On all three flashlights, the ball contact pitted the negitive side of the battery causing an intermittant contact. On another, the switch completely failed after the rubber boot tore off. I finally ended up putting them in a vise and throwing them away. I think this is why Costco stopped carring them. I keep the fourth flashlight at home for dinking around the garage. This flashlight is okay for occasional but not heavy-duty use."
4,Streamlight 4AA Great light,"I purchased one to try out while on jobs outside of the plant. The flashlight worked so well that I purchase two more for the maintenance dept. Everyone likes them so well that we have to make sure that they do not walk off. Flashlight is smaller and lighter than the 2-D cell maglites that we use to have. It is much easier to use around the equipment and out on job sites. Light quality is great and so is the battery life. I even put these lights in my wife's and sons cars; my brother is even going to get one for his birthday. If you want a versatile light, this is it. I have no problem recommending this flashlite."
1,Cheaply made product,"I just received this flashlight in anticipation of Hurricaine Irene. I paid the extra money for 1 day shipping. When I installed the batteries, I found that the seal around the head of the flashlight was not tight enough to keep the light on. SO much for emergency lighting durng the upcoming hurricaine. A waste of money."
2,worked...for a while,"Worked for slightly over a year, then the switch failed. Nice flashlight up to that point, but why pay for a Streamlight that doesn't last? You can get that from a generic for less than half price."
1,Design Flaw,"This flashlight has a design flaw. After a while, the lights began to flicker. The factory replaced it and the replacement did the same thing. I called again and they said they would send a new one, but they never did."
4,LED Flashlight,It's plenty bright for just 4 AA batteries. Buy the mounting bracket because there isn't really any other easy way to secure it to your turnout gear.
2,Expected More From Streamlight,"Yes, it's bright. Yes, it's light. Yes, it pretty much runs forever on a set of batteries.With that said, I expected more from Streamlight. I love all of the metal LED flashlights I've bought from them; however this flashlight lacks the same quality of it's metal cousins. The fit is loose enough where it allows the batteries or some other electrical contacts to move around resulting in a shake on/off effect. While this is tolerable in most instances, it should not happen anytime."
1,poor streamlight owner,"I received many of these FREE from my job, and feel I paid to much. Junk pure junk. Lots of various problems, I need to keep stretching the rear spring because the batteries loose contact, spring must not be tempered correctly, bulps quit, one leaked water from the rear button, etc.Does not project light very far (10 yards), batteries rattle, etc. As a Quality Assurance Specialist it's embarrassing to carry."
2,No longer a good deal,"4 years ago I thought this was a good flashlight, but a lot has changed since then. For the same price, you can get better LED flashlights from other brands. Even Mag makes a better LED flashlight now. Almost any flashlight with either a 1- or 3-watt LED will be brighter and run off of fewer batteries."
5,For Firefighters,"Excellent flashlight for a firefighter helmet!!!It's really easy to handle even with the gloves on, and it has a shinny light."
3,"Worked great, hot auto storage.. now finicky","When I first got it, it worked very well. This thing is bright and well contained. However, after I put this in my glove compartment and kept my car outside in hot California desert summer, the heat started to deteriorate it's functionality. It seems that when I turn it on it has ""two"" brightness settings that it goes through, first dim and then very bright, but sometimes after using it a while and clicking it off and on it will stay on the lower brightness. Basically, I think the inside heat of my car weakened the circuit. Yes, I've changed the batteries.It does have a nice ""glow"" feature within the LED bulbs (after turning it off you can still see the LEDs glow in the dark).Be careful of dropping it, especially when it's dismantled. The shiny reflective part has begun to flake on mine.Bottom line, if you're storing this in the car, beware of this flashlight's resilience to heat. Of course, your results may vary."
5,excellent resource,"I suspect this is my problem and have found this book to be an informative resource, but hemochromatosis is not just 'chemical' iron overload, but a 'magnetic' ironload, too. I urge every one who has this disease of iron overload to to read the Bioinitiative Report at [...]and then to search for cell phone towers and antennas on [...]because this is likely why you have the disease and the gene. We have too many manmade electromagnetic/microwave/radiowave fields in the environment today, especially with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. It seems there is a cell phone tower on every corner, and many people use cordless phones, too, which is the equivalent of having a cell phone mast inside your home. Please research this for yourself. The cause of Hemochromatosis is electromagnetic and microwave radiation from power lines, cell phone towers, radar, etc... This book will really open your eyes though."
4,Excellent source book,"Book is certainly a great source of information, though obviously some contributors to the anthology are better than others. Many excellent illustrations in the printed version."
4,Evil gets its day,The premise behind this book is what caught my eye - evil defeats good. I wasn't disappointed. I was surprised by the number of different approaches the authors took. (I was expecting a lot of re-told fairy tales...)
4,Excellent read,"The pace of this book is pretty good overall. There are a few amusing stories, but for the most part, these short stories have a dark, somber mood. That doesn't mean that the stuff in them aren't exciting! Sometimes, it's hard to figure out just who is the evil one. The points of view are diverse, showing us that not every evil is doomed to be thwarted."
3,It was dull,"I thought this book would be an interesting read, and I was a little disappointed.The writing style was only mediocre - readable but not fabulous.Plus for a famous person she had no controversy so that made it a little dull - there were some interesting bits, for example, when she suspected another famous personality of leaking her opinions of her movies to the press. Plus a few others including her difficult times at school and financial abuse by her father...butThis book was another skillful dodge of controversy by Shirley Temple Black, I think this book would've been better if she had written from the heart and given her opinions instead of just reciting events chronologically."
4,very good tsunami video,"This is the best movie I've found about this catastrophic tsunami event. Good explanation, good footage of the terrible power of the tsunami as it came ashore and moved through towns; well paced. Get this movie while it is still available."
4,Look at an extraordinarly life,"I'm very impressed by Sylvia Browne.She is the most accurate psychic I've ever seen.I think she has an amazing talent. And I have read a few of her other books. I was fascinated by her stories of all of her psychic experiences and her detailed account of the life of a psychic starting in early childhood.That being said, I disagree with some of Sylvia's beliefs about God and the afterlife.Those are just not my beliefs and I can't fully reconcile or incorporate them into my own.I would recommend this book for any fans of Sylvia or anyone interested in any kind of psychic phenomena."
3,a generally uninspired collection of essays,"It is not surprising that this collection of essays is uneven, since such volumes usually are. Here, only two of the essays stand out as particularly instructive -- David Wilkins's on whether a lawyer should subordinate his or her identity to (certain) professional ideals, and Koniak & Cohan's on counterproductive incentives built into the class-action system. Several other essays contain an interesting idea or two, but most often they are too impressionistic, and their recommendations too general, to be of any real use.I also must mention one odd thing about this book: it almost appears that someone involved in its production bore a grudge against Wilkins, because his name is misspelled in the table of contents, his bio is strangely truncated, and there are...many egregious typos in his essay..."
5,Brent era grace,Excellent early Brent era show surpassed only by #5 in the Dick's Picks series. Excellent singles as well as jams. Excellent sound quality.
3,A look into the fashion of the past,"An interesting delve into the restrictive fashion rules and standards of the 60's. Reading this proved to me how much more social freedom we have now, yet we create our own prisons with clothes and the social standings that we classify by them."
5,"Elegance: the best fashion ""how to"" ever written","Yes, this book may be a bit restrictive and dated, but it is still the best and most sophisticated book of its kind ever written. My copy is old and tattered, but I too reread it every few years. First, know the rules, and then if you want to break them, fine. If you like retro, this is a must."
4,"Charming book, no dust jacket?","I received this book promptly, and it came in good condition, but without the (pictured) dust jacket. It's certainly not a deal breaker for me, though I believe if it's in the picture, it should be in the package. Otherwise fast, easy service, and a charming book."
3,If You Are Looking for This Bulb...,"You may find it a Walmart. I bought 2 today at $2.42 each. I use it in my Luxo desk lamp. I do not find that they last very long (the one that just failed lasted less than 6 months) and for my purposes they get quite hot. BTW, the GE number on the package is 90401; it is marked as a specialty bulb. Their is also the number S11 on the package. If Walmart doesn't have it, I also saw it at Staples today for $5.99 (wow). Search the internet, you can surely find a cheaper replacement.I also purchased a GE 25 watt bulb at Walmart that has the same base and was also marked as a specialty bulb. It is GE number 90466 and T7. The bulb is called an Indicator 25 and states it is for a microwave oven. The back of the package says it replaces the 40T8N and can be used in ""microwaves refrigerators and oven"". I am using it in my Luxo now and it doesn't give off near the heat that the 40 watt bulb does, yet still gives me ample light."
1,Worlds most expensive bulb,"The entertainment center I purchased, five years ago, uses two of these bulbs. On average, I get 50-60 hours of usage per bulb. At four dollars each, I've spent a bloody fortune. GE doesn't even list an estimated life on the package as they do with many other types and styles of bulbs they manufacture. The bottom tip of the last bulb I replaced was not even attached. It resembled a button in that you could push it down and then it would pop back. I'm in the process of trying to find a replacement bulb. Unfortunately, all of the retailers I have visited only carry this bulb. I may end up having to replace my cabinets current lighting configuration just to get away from having to spend any more on these bulbs."
1,only lasted 3-months,I cannot believe that this light bulb only lasted 3-months. Wow. Obvisly a bad product and not worth the trouble.
2,Don't Last,"The first one I bought lasted a good while. Have not had a good one since. Seem to last about 3 or 4 weeks (avg 8 hours day), and then the filament burns out. That's a lot of money (60/yr) to spend on a single lamp. I'm going to try one of the asian knockoffs which I think cost 1/4 of what these do. I don't think they can be much worse. Lol!"
3,Georg Levin - Can't Hold Back,"Oftentimes, a vocalist's solo album depends on his producers. So with Jazzanova at the helm of Georg Levin's debut, CAN'T HOLD BACK, it can't go wrong. Can it? Generally not. The rhythms here are mellow, and the vibe chill. There's the slow electro of ""You Know What You Want But You Won't Get It"" and the subtle rhythm guitar of ""When I'm With You."" The downtempo goes perhaps a little overboard with ""Everything,"" slipping into soporific territory, and the back-and-forth on ""Insider"" doesn't quite work, but ""Can't Hold Back"" makes up for that deficiency. ""(I Got) Somebody New"" tacks on a mellow house beat. And though no one can deny the soulfulness of Levin's voice, at times it takes on a nasal tinge that dampens the mood. But as a showcase for his voice, the clean arrangement for the piano ballad ""Mrs. Superficial"" puts his voice front and center."
4,Loved it. Like A Funkier Donald Fagen Project,"Georg manages to mix R&B structures with contemporary sounds and instrumentation along with Steely Dan-esque horns and yes, guitar solos. Love the chords he uses for the tunes. A few downtempo tunes, so not entirely correct to label this ""Dance"", but they are all pretty pleasant.""Mrs. Superficial"" is the only one I don't like. Doesn't fit with the rest of the set. Otherwise, it would have 5 stars from me."
3,Georg Levin debut cd,"The cd on a whole was pretty well rounded...it has a few standout cuts like ""In my car and the smash hit ""somebody new"".,bu there werent any other uptempo dance joints such as ""Somebody New""(which also features Clara Hill on vocals.)I hope that the cd gets some shine as well as some remixes done soon.The vocals are smooth & might remind you a little bit of Vikter Duplaix.What makes this CD a worthy purchase is the tightness of the instruments."
2,fit at 40,"Ive been wanting to do Pilates more, but not with these two broads! On the DVD I have, you get to go to Blondies Malibu mansion to exercise, get to see how the other half lives, and good grief, what a joke that is! But I couldnt get past the boob jobs on these women, who did they make this tape for anyway? And the camera angle is over head just in case you missed all that cleveage. My my, dont they stand up straight tho! This would be a great tape for men tho, and I highly recomend it to them, but for us ladies, it was a sad statement about what we are all supposed to have and look like. And they didnt really do Pilates in the first one I watched, just regular old areobics. I hope I can sell my 4 DVDs, what a joke this is."
2,Not very good quality,I loved the other three fit at 40's but this one had poor video quality which made me not want to mess with it.
2,Good potential sadly not realized,"after finding the demo I bought the game to see what else it had to offer answer ""not much"" the game has several bugs not the least of which is your main weapon will use all your energy to kill one creature ""maybe"" in the mean time his friends are having you for lunch. To make a bad situation worse the game is largly unsupported with no patches available and only one rather schetchy walk-thru. There are better games out there."
5,Yogi gives insights to meditation only...,"I was friends with Arun while he was producing this book. I was in awe on the wealth of experience and knowledge he had on the topic. He always impressed me with solutions to common things most of us overlook, including other authors on this topic, and the book is just as knowledgable and helpful.I have enjoyed this book immensely over and over again. It is a must have on my shelf so that when I become lost again, all I have to do is pick it up, open to any exercise, and practice. Yogi makes it feel as easy as getting back on the bicycle again after you have fallen off."
5,"Very nicely packaged, variety of goodies","Sent this as a Mother's Day gift. The lady who received it thought it was wonderful. The 3 decorative oval boxes can be reused. They contain a variety of sweets & goodies that taste good and last a while. Although I had it ""gift wrapped"" by Amazon, you don't need to do that because the original gift packaging is already decoratively designed without the need for additional wrapping. All in all, a nice gift for a lady with a sweet tooth.A previous reviewer mentions a ""watering can"" which is NOT part of this gift; this food gift tower comes in 3 graduated size oval hatbox-style containers, not a watering can."
4,cheering gift,"It was cheering the whole clinic while this gift pack arrived in according the nurse lady there. So 4 stars here. If I had a chance to taste the candies, I might raise the 5th star~"
2,Very POOR Quality,"I've used these fewer than 5 occasions and the plug-in adapter already has some type of short, therefore useless. If you ""fudge"" around with it enough you may get it to work. FRUSTRATING!"
3,RCA 900 MHz wireless headphones,"I own an older pair of these, so decided to get another one based on performance of previous model. Like this one better in terms of ease of use (auto tuning), but don't like the headphones because they are very uncomfortable. I have taped the inner tension panel to the upper panel to make them less tight on my head."
4,Absolutely delightful!,"I first saw this on VH1 and loved it! I had no idea I could buy it. I am a Jewel fan, and I understand this was before she became a success. A must for diehard Oz fans like myself."
3,Amazing Concert,"I saw this on television when it first aired in 1995. I bought it when it first came out in VHS for my young children. Have watched it for years and enjoy it every time. HOWEVER, I am so disappointed waiting for it to be released on DVD and Blue Ray. there is another whole generation of children who would love this but VHS is going the way of Beta and 8 tracks. can we please move this into the 21st century. I now have grandchildren who would so love this! Please release this on DVD!"
1,"The most disappointing movie I have ever seen, ever!!","This has to be a joke... they are actually reading their lines from a script. And the scenery, if it can be called that, is the leanest and cheapest attempt I've ever seen. I've seen better elementary school plays...including some of the acting."
3,Flawed but shows great promise,"Niki Kwik is a talented young Phoenix singer-songwriter in the acoustic rock vein. Her live performances are spirited and enjoyable, as is much of the material on this CD. Niki's voice is reminiscent of Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders, her acoustic guitar playing is excellent and she writes catchy, tuneful songs. Unfortunately, this effort is seriously flawed by production errors, most significantly, the fact that Niki's guitar is noticeably out-of-tune for most of the recordings. This gets my rating bumped by two stars. I am sure, however, that Niki's next effort will be a significant improvement. This first disc will have to do in the meantime and will be an interesting collector's item if she manages to break out into widespread popularity, which her obvious talent warrants."
5,Chock full of ways to use tea tree oil for health and beauty,"Explains well the many ways to use this incredible natural remedy. A frined follwoed the books instructions and it healed the fungal infection on his foot. As the book recommended, I told a girlfriend to massage some onto her scalp and add some to her shampoo, to get rid of her itching scalp and dandruff that she had unsuccessfully tried many dandruff shampoos on, it worked. I used it for my eczema, like the book said and finally have something safe and easy to use for my skin problem. tea tree and this book are staples I wwould not want to be without - they are great!"
1,TERRIBLE,"The only good track here is the lsat one from The Lost World. A cool piano/synthesizer rendition. Everything else sucks. I bought this for the Batman and Robin tracks, I thought at the least they would be synthesized renditions of the orchestral score, but they are just songs performed by this ""American Film Orchestra"" band. The Con Air overture is decent too, when I bought this I was not expecting a CD with vocals."
2,Too scholarly. Skip unless using for a sociology paper.,"I found this quite well-researched book too clinical for a juicy subject of the organized crime. More than anything it is a consolidation of previous works of journalists and investigators presented in a tone of a laboratory study. Few interesting historical backgrounds in each chapter are outweighed by bland data analysis that seems endless, and in this respect the book, in my opinion, is of low literary value to the general public. Spare yourself time and money and look for authors who interview the subjects firsthand, such as C. Freeland, P Klebnikov, R. Freedman, etc."
3,Well made,"The hood protector is very nice looking and built well. The only problem with it is the fasteners they send with it. First time through a car wash and it blew right off, broke all four fasteners. Fortunately I didn't run it over when pulling out of the car wash. I replaced the fastners with S/S bolts."
3,Good..but not complete,"If you are studying for the MCP exam this is a good start but beware, despite claims from Microsoft, this is not all you'll need. At minimum you'll also need the Windows 98 Resource Kit in order to learn info needed to pass the exam. Interestingly, if you buy the Micorosft exam prep package it even refers you to the resource kit for information on many of the questions. Do yourself a favor and buy both books at the same time."
3,"Good, but if you're doing the MCP you need more.","Microsoft Press have kept up their tradition of a difficult-to-follow-in-places book-and-cdrom set, which is designed mainly for people studying for MCP 70-098, like myself. With the practice exams anyway (I have not yet sat the real exam) I found that I needed suppliments to it - mainly the Resource Kit. It makes you wonder if this is some conspiracy from MS to make us buy..."
3,"Good Book, Not enough, CD is useless with Explorer 5.0","The Book is fine. As the others have said it's not enough, but close if you use the review book. The CD does not work with Internet Explorer 5.0."
4,GOOD BOOK,"This is an excellent book for the candidates appearing for their mcp's and wanting to test thier fake in the beta exam.this book provides all the necessary items to be completed by the mcps,but he thing is, not all books provide all.The Pre-reqisite is builiding a self-confidence all proceed all with your efforts.Success is on the road,which is visible to you.For instance this is book is good. thanking you"
5,Cracked,I live on the coast and wear sandals a lot. I don't want my feet to be cracked and dry. This Foot Works is wonderful. It doesn't feel oily or greasy and my feet look and feel soft and smooth. I love it.
5,Great foot cream,Love this cream. It keeps my feet soft and nice. Would highly recommend to anyone. Arrived quickly. No problemsPut this cream on your feet before going to bed and your feet will stay soft and supple. I just love it and Amazon.
5,The best book on the Great White Shark available,"Richard Ellis and Dr. John E. McCosker bring their years ofexperience and knowledge about the Great White Shark to the public in this exhaustive study of the world's most fearsome predator. With their words and hundreds of stunning photographs (by Al Giddings and others), they reveal an animal that is not the monster of popular fiction but instead, an efficient and awesome product of evolution. This book is a must for any student or fan of the Great White"
5,Great but..,"The book is amazing, the authors made an excellent rewiew about the great white shark but...the cover of the book off when I was in the middle of it. Bad quality cover"
1,"Not the original ""Spectrum"" that Richard & Karen were in.","This is definitely just the music of the Carpenters. When I got this CD, I was excited to think I was getting a CD with early songs that Karen & Richard did with their group, Spectrum, but alas, I was greatly mistaken. A nice collection of Carpenters music (no vocals)."
3,Music of The Carpenters by Spectrum,"What would be great is if you could get copies of one of the first efforts of Karen and Richard Carpenter, when they (along with friends) formed a group called Spectrum."
5,Great replacement part,"Works like the original. Easy to install and all the screws fit perfectly. Feels like a quality part, not some cheap knock off from China. The price is very resaonable, so instead of buying a cheap no-name, I recommend buying the Beck Arnley."
5,Badge Holders - Just what I wanted.,Just what I ordered. Good price. Good quality. And I was grateful they shipped a lot sooner than projected.
4,Great value for the price,These name badges are a great value for the price! We are using them over and over and they have held up well. We are very happy with them. Will buy them again when we need more.
1,Sorry service from movie mars,"The DVDs arrived in a timely manner. I watched the first one. THen tried loading the second disc to watch the conclusion. My DVD player kept saying disc error. I removed the disc and looked at the back of it. It had been broken and then concealed completely across the width of the disc. Then some sort of cosmetic seal across the break. Regardless it won't and still won't play. I contacted the seller, and contacted Amazon. Nothing was done, I have never heard from the seller. I wont recommend Moviemars for anyone as they are unreliable and do not live up to the Amazon contract. THey do not stand behind their product and this borders on deception."
4,Must Read - Trip Back in Time to the 70s!,"This novel, VELVET SKY by Rusty Van Reeves, is a multi-story effort. This guy knows how to cook on all cylinders. Once this book sets up the main characters it thrusts them into the fire and you find yourself (the reader) being pulled in from every direction.The book has a few minor grammar errors and a typo here and there but it takes NOTHING away from this multi-harmony storyline! Four stars outta five! _Bengi"
3,"ok, not great","I like the smoothe,spacey Dead in general and this is more raw and heavy. ""estimated Prophet"" is very good but I thought most songs were rough. Go a few years back or forward. The ""heavy"" Dead in the late 1970's has a bad sound. ""the wheel"" is just plain lousy and thin sounding. It is still a solid CD but I wouldn't buy it again."
4,Classic GD,"The reason i like this release so much is because they go the extra mile on the tunes. This is taken from 2 nights plus some songs from the Milwaukee show. Like most Dicks Picks, the songs really stand out. The first disc which comprises a really nice 1st set stands out w/ Deal and Music Never Stopped as big hits. The 2nd disc is the 2nd set from The UNI dome show and is one of the best 2nd sets/ or 90 minutes of dead in one disc. And the 3rd disc is the 2nd set from the Feb 3 show in WI which is solid playing throughout.I am more a fan of progressive rock (Genesis, Premiata forneria marconi), but the tunes on DP 18 are all high energy and are classic Grateful Dead = )Additionally, the disc w/ the Scarlet - Fire from Cedar Falls deserves 5 stars. It is some of the best music they've done or has been done on earth = )"
4,A solid Dick's Pick,"I primarily bought DP 18 to hear the Scarlet Begonias>Fire on the Mountain combination on disc 3, which is widely regarded as one of the best ever. I was not disappointed. Discs 2 and 3 also provide a number of beautifully understated versions of expansive Grateful Dead songs, including an Estimated Prophet>Eyes of the World>Playing in the Band>The Wheel>Playing in the Band mix and a Truckin'>Drums>Other One>Wharf Rat mix. Disc 1 presents a standard mix of first set material with Cold Rain and Snow being my personal favorite. The quality of the music and the sound are solid throughout. As the jamming in DP 18 generally tends to be very understated, it took me a few listens to really appreciate the beauty of the playing in these shows. If you are patient, I believe that you will really enjoy it too. Highly recommended."
4,"Dick's Picks, Vol. 18","Product was a Christmas present, Dad opened it immediately and listened to it immediately. He has no complaints with the product. Service was great, received the gift ahead of expected time."
3,Excellent condition.....,I love the way the packages was sent. Not damages great condition the movie was ok; I should have pick a better movie. Definitely I will buy again...
2,This movie sucks,This movie sucks. Trench looked good in it but it sucks. I could have done something better with my time.
1,Why?,"I am personally tired of all the ""Women are wonderful, Men are horrible"" rhetoric, sheist. This movie is a complete waste of time, and plastic used to make the DVD. Ask an honest question. If men are dogs, what are you calling his parents, in particular, his mother?I'undi."
4,Funny,"I thought this movie was funny enough to be on DVD and not a major motion picture. They did right by putting it straight to DVD. I thought the characters were hilarious but why did Robin Givens have to be in it. I really don't care too much for her at all, but i will admit she did do a pretty good job."
2,Crooner BRIAN EVANS is in this movie! Only thing GOOD ABOUT!,"This movie sucked. Let's be real. Brian Evans, the singer, appears but naked. ONLY this good about it!"
3,OK Rainy Day Movie,"This is an OK Rainy Afternoon Movie, its obvious why it was straight to video, although you have some well known actors involved. If cussing makes you uncomfortable this movie may not be for you, and if questionable content (i.e. adultry, STD's, etc) is offensive, you may want to skip this movie. It was all in all an ok movie, but a little heavy on the female bashing, men may like that after all they generally are on the receiving end of the bashing. But if all of the above doesn't bother you, you may want to check it out if you are having a Saturday at the movie kind of day."
4,The way a man sees us,This movie gave another pont of view from a mans point of view and i really gave it alot of thought and used this movie to not make those mistakes with my man.
4,Comfortable!,"Comfortable sandal. But it's good for the narrow foot. If your foot is kind of width, it might be not the good one for you. Or you can order 1/2 size up. Anyhow~ I really love my Clarks sandal!!"
5,Variety for everyone!,"I've had my copy of this book for almost 10 years, and I never get tired of the variety that it contains. Face it, we've all become more dependent upon lean protein like chicken, but for many of us, that can get pretty darn boring night after night. McNair has responded to this problem with a broad range of recipes that are guaranteed to please all tastes. (I've never run across the typo mentioned by a previous reviewer, but anyone who cooks on a regular basis should be able to spot such a misprint immediately, if it exists.) McNair's recipes have been able to withstand the test of time in my house, and I'm happily anticipating his next volume--FAVORITES!"
4,Yum!,"This soft-cover book contains some wonderful chicken recipes (the chicken tamale pie is my personal favorite). And the photography alone makes you hungry.This is my first ""McNair book,"" but it won't be my last!"
5,Libertarianism - explained,"This is an outstanding book, especially as a first read regarding a libertarian philosophy. Boaz not only explains classic liberal development and application of libertarianism to today's issues, he offers suggestions for addressing our present day loss of liberty and the unfortunate advance of socialism in America today. This is a much better source regarding libertarianism than ""The Conscience of a Libertarian"" (Root)and the solutions suggested are less radical, clearly thought out and more rationally adopted. I would also recommend ""A Return to Common Sense"" (Mullen) as a fine companion for this book."
4,Guaranteed to make you think!,"A very good, intellectually stimulating book on modern Libertarianism. This is a short but packed book that is a must read regardless of your political beliefs. It is certainly guaranteed to make you think."
5,Libertarianism is an education in politics and economics,"For those who feel as if their lives are increasingly being directed from above, this book is a vindication of such feelings, and an explanation of why it is true. The book disects the idea that proposes that a small ruling elite should manage the masses, and exposes it for its shortcomings on moral and practical grounds."
2,There are better choices,I started reading this book but had to stop after disagreeing with the author on too many of his examples. In the opening pages he cites Argentina as a great example of how Freemarket reform brings success. This was true when the book was written but since then no-one can disagree that free markets in Argentina have imploded and have not been to the benefit of its citizens. Maybe I'll finish the book someday but for now its been relegated to the bookshelf.
2,Con Job?,"The book is splattered with a few good or at least interesting ideas, but you get the feeling that Boaz is trying to peddle off a perpetual motion machine."
1,trashing mine,"I was as enthusiastic as everyone else when i first hooked mine up. install dierectly to my stereo was a no brainer. I got the thing just because I like Pandora radio. It worked great for about a week. Since then its been nothing but a source of aggravation. It's either randomly turning off, or it ""can't connect to squeezenetwork."" And when it is conected half the time the connection is weak and fades in and out. I think Id be better off with a coat hanger. And I have absolutely NO problem with my mac connecting to the wireless network. Ever. It's back to itunes for me. wouldnt recommend you buy this piece of crap in case I didnt make it clear."
1,I also have nothing but silence,"I too can relate to all of the reviewers who can not get sound. Slim Devices drops my wireless signal about every three minutes. It is very rare that it will play a whole song. I have tried a linksys G router, a US Robotics router, and now a D Link router. I am not using other wireless resource while it is playing besides my latop. All of my other wireless devices show ""excellent"" signal strength while this thing can not seem to locate a network. Customer support said it was my router's power settings. I am on my third router from three different manufactures and I think it is the sqeezebox. I would recommend passing on this product as I am sitting here playing MP3s on my laptop speakers looking at my Squeexebox screen stating its usual ""Problem, can't find a wireless network"" message."
4,"Great film, DVD Extras too limited","I hate to be the first person to give this item less than 5 stars since we've owned and enjoyed the VHS version for many years. We just recently obtained the DVD, partly to see the extras. The 'bonus' items were good, although I would have liked more. Something that discussed the ""Nine Old Men"" as a group, focusing on Frank and Ollie's role within that esteemed body would have been fantastic. The main reason for withholding a star is that the DVD Extras have no ""Play All"" feature. Some of the bonus items are very short and going back to the menu each time is a pain and time waster."
4,Practical Strategies for Teaching Teens Who Struggle with Reading,"I highly recommend this book because it offers strategies for literacy/reading teachers that are not only practical, but strategies that teens will use."
1,bad dartboard,"Was looking for a dartboard, with a cabinet for our basement game area. The product was price right. Upon receipt of the dartboard and unpacking, I realized that I had purchased a bad product. The unit came unassembled and what was really bad was the cabinet, with only staples to hold it together. I had to drill holes and screw it together. Was one of the worst products that I have ever purchased on line."
5,This Book Will Mesmerize You,"Once I started reading City Room, I had only one regret--that I had to get my customary quota of sleep. Every night, I was tempted to forget the clock, and enjoy more of Arthur Gelb's enthralling story about his lifelong love affair with The New York Times. Yet the book expands far beyond reliving the development of a writer and his newspaper. City Room reflects the emergence of the nation during some of America's most historic events. Plus, readers will enjoy the author's stories about celebrities he knew, interviewed, entertained, and wrote about.City Room will mesmerize you. I expect to remain under Athur Gelb's spell for a long time."
4,A Wonderful Resource for Confused Shakespeare Lovers!,"This a fantastic little book that makes the play ""Much Ado About Nothing"" really come alive! You understand so much when you read it that you never realized before. I am definitely a fan of the No Fear Shakespeare collection and plan on reading more!"
5,I enjoyed this book very much,"Although this book (series) is geared towards high school students, there is something in here for everyone. The essays vary in their subject matter and style, and anyone can learn something from reading them.I highly recommend this series if you are at all interested in the history and current situation of our relationship with the Middle East, and why 9/11 and the 2 Iraq war(s) occurred."
3,CAUTION!!!!!!!,"this rack is not what is pictured !!!! the left & right mounting arms on the front of this rack are not as pictured!! ...I was dissapointed to find this out after i opened the package and I immediately saw that this was not the rack in the picture!!. The front mount is 1 piece (not seperate mounting arms as pictured).. designed with 1 screw-hole, the hardware inclosed gives you a universal fit, I had to fit it to the small cross bar that ran horizontal between the factory frame mounts..( looks like the letter ""A"") between the seatpost and rear tire..It ""works"" but it is a ""cheeessseee"" way to mount this rack ..it is not as sturdy as it would be, if mounted to the seperate ""arms"" and factory screw-holes on my frame as the picture might indicate. Unless you have fabrication ability..I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RACK !!!!...THERE ARE NO INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS ON USING THE UNIVERSAL MOUNTING PARTS."
3,Bike Rack,"Rack mounted easily and works well. Only thing missing when compared to ""real"" Pletscher rack on my other bike is a flip up bracket that keeps larger items from sliding out from under the spring loaded arm. The mounting holes are there but there is no bracket supplied."
1,Worst rack ever!!!,"I tried mounting this rack to my bike and was utterly perplexed as to how I was supposed to mount it much less how exactly it functioned as a rack. It comes with no hardware or even instructions. This thing looks like some sort of black cable reel and not at all like a ""vintage style"" cargo rack."
2,A Concise Review of the 2004 Primary,"Alexander pens a concise review of the 2004 primary with what he calls an ""insiders perspective."" Unfortunately what results is not news but rather a simple historical review of what happened. This book is poor on analysis and perhaps even poorer on its account and its claims of access to the candidate and the campaign.However, for those looking for a short read on the simple events of the 2004 Democratic primary, ""The Candidate"" will suffice. Unfortunately, if one is searching for the magical key to Kerry's historical turnaround or how the Dean machine fell apart, bitter disappointment is the only result."
5,10 Stars: My highest of ratings!,"Reviewer: Renee S. N.Y.C.This is one of my favorite Francis novels, because of the intricasy of the plot and the fascinating look into the world of photography, regular and trick. As always, Francis gives great value for your money, and for your reading pleasure. My highest of ratings."
4,Reflex,"The book ""Reflex"" is well written. The writer perfectly mixes the horseracer's life with photographing. There are many suspects that will keep you guessing who the killer is. The book also gives clear picture of horeracing, and it also has photographing techniques. It's recommended for anyone who enjoys a good mystery."
2,disappointing,"Pace was slow, too focused on technical photographic insights, and no real human interest component. No real surprises and sadly a poor read."
4,Yum!,"This delicious cookbook has an incredible variety of chocolate cake and icing recipes (who could imagine so many variations of Devil's Food??). I have made a few cakes from this cookbook, and they have been absolutely to-die-for. My only complaints are: 1. that they don't tell you which recipes produce that heavenly-looking slice of cake on the dust jacket, and 2. too few color plates! The recipes themselves vary from simple to very complicated, and from lightly to intensely chocolatey. There is sure to be something for everyone who likes chocolate cake here!"
4,I recommend it,"A great product... I own three of them!Plus:* Good clarity* Nightvision* Can be clipped onto ur laptop* compactMinus:Sometimes the nightvision is turned-on even though it is day, i.e., when the cam is in a comparatively dim-lit place, it starts glowing. And I hafta put it under the light source to turn it off."
2,"I bought 2 from DreamBargains, one DOA and other died.","I bought two of these, one of which never was recognized by any PC and never even lit the LED's. The other did light the LED's and I could see picture for a couple of days, then it started connecting and disconnecting from the computer (the USB status) while still plugged in. I tried it on several computers with the same results - finally it just quit connecting completely (but the lights still light up).I contacted DreamBargains and they offered a full refund for both if I send them back to them. I checked and the cost for me to pay to ship them back plus my time isn't worth the effort. I'll keep the around as ""dummy"" security cameras."
2,Simple is not always good.,"This camera was really cheap to buy ""new"" and really easy to install (plug and play). It does have its issues though.Pros:+ Adjustable picture quality to make for a crisp picture.+ Plug and play allows easy use on many computers.Cons:- Clip does not hold to laptop well and falls off frequently.- Even with volume all the way up, everybody hears me as a whisper unless my face is 3 inches from the camera...in which case, they see a REALLY big close up!Overall, it was less than 10 dollars after shipping and tax and the video part works fine. If you have a microphone built into your computer, this would be a great buy!"
4,Good price,"This is a good web cam for the price I paid. Works good, easy to install, and easy to use."
3,Webcam with Lights,"I got this product because it had a microphone as well. I love how clear the webcam is and how easy an image can be adjusted; however, I have some difficulty with the microphone as others have relayed they can not hear me for video conferences."
3,Great camera for the price,"This camera is excellent for its price. I paid around $15 with shipping. I haven't used it with the audio part yet since I haven't had the need to. It works perfectly with Yahoo. Only thing preventing it from getting a 4/5 star rating is that the camera does not have Vista 64 drivers (not a major issue if you don't use that version of Windows) and there is no way to control the lights on it. Don't believe the ""night vision"" claims, just because it has 6 leds on the front that are turned on in low light environments does not mean it is night vision.I would recommend this camera if you just need something cheap and simple."
1,cam,i got this cam and it doese not work i need the driver for this cam and can not gind it this is not a good gam
5,AMAZING CD,"I remember when I first heard about Deepsky it was 1998 and i was just 12 years old. my freind was a dj and he had this 12' vinyl called Deepsky - Tempest 98' after listening to that song I became a very big fan of Deepsky i would go to the store and grab anything that had Deepsky on it without listening to it and their live PA's are just awsome I saw them for my very first time last year and they rocked the house no one was disapointed what really amazed me was that they played their remix of Sasha -Wavy Gravy man when they played that song the whole crowd was in full BLISS they never released that remix on vinyl. this cd is an Amazing cd from Prog. Breaks ,Drum & Bass, Prog. House & trance this cd has it all I've been a fan of Deepsky for 6 years and they have never let me down favorite tracks View From A Stairway,Jareth's Church,Ride,3 Sheets To The Wind,..."
5,Top Quality Techno!,"First lemme start off sayin ,I love this cd!Every single song is different in its own little way.The first time I saw Deepsky was in Charlotte,NC at one of the Flavor parties and they blew me the hell up!They have so many different influences,including Trance,Techno,Drum N Bass,Breaks,Electronica...and the list goes on.I'll ""take a ride on the rays of the sun"" anyday with them...If your a fan of ANY electronic dance music go out and buy this now!"
4,Good Album from an American DJ,"I first learned about Deepsky after hearing the song Stargazer in some club. I was very satisified after purchasing their single last year.I must say that this CD does not have one single song which stands out like Stargazer, but most of the songs are not bad. I like songs with a good melody, and Deepsky carries good melody.Regarding Deepsky the musicans, anyone who has seen their live gig before can tell you that they are amazing. They actually perform the synths live, in addition to playing the DJ sets. They are also one of the few good American composers (as opposed to mixing other ppl's pieces) in the progressive trance scene (Utah Saints do not do trance nor are they Americans)."
3,A decent album,"While not the best album I have heard in a while, Deepsky's debut is a solid listen nonetheless. Being more a fan of Breakbeat than trance, I tend to like tracks 1, 2, 3, 7, and 12, while listening to the other 4 on the floor tracks sparsely. The best track on the album by far is the track 12, the Hybrid-esque ""Let me live"". It's a somewhat slower tempo progressive breaks masterpiece that smacks of Hybrid's ""Finished Symphony"". After that, Track 7, ""Metro"", is a great song to drive to on a lonesome highway at night, while the trancey ""Ride"" (track 4) is an energy riddled dance number if your into the 4 drum."
5,Best electronic record of 2002,"One of the best electronic releases I've heard period. This record is a melding of breakbeat, techno & progressive trance. What separates this record from similiar records is the overall strength and quality of the songs. Any fan of Crystal Method should appreciate this record and yes its every bit as good as Vegas. Too bad this record didn't receive more hype and promotion because its definitely an underappreciated gem."
5,a must buy dance cd for 2002,"this is the best cd's i have bought, other than Politics of Dancing(PVD). i didnt like it much at first but i gave it a listen like a month later and it has been a favorite of mine since. i dont have any favorite tracks i like them all. i see some people dont like the song ""smile"". i love it, thumpin bass line and awesome breakbeat. anyway support deepsky, go buy their cd"
5,Great remastered video and sound,"This set contains six of Gene's best films, nicely remastered, with great picture and sound. Many other video releases of Gene's films are taken from scratchy and spliced up 16mm prints made for TV stations in the 1950s and those look horrible compared to this set. This set is a proper presentation of these films, from 35mm materials."
3,Not bad at all,It's not the greatest but works fine and we've had fun playing with it. Took awhile to get the darts put together. Overall for the price is good. Not recommended for heavy users or those practicing to go on a dart team. But for ocassional fun it does fine. No problems with unit.
1,disappointing,"The darts do not stay assembled. On our first time using the product,3 darts broke (one shattered into many pieces). It was frustrating to spend more time setting up and hanging the board than actually playing the game."
2,LCD Dartboard,Dart tips are easily bent and broken. I should have bought the regular dartboard because it's too loud to play in the office when it gets contact with the dart. It's all plastic.
4,Worth the price.,"I bought this a few days back and am it is totally worth the money. There was a slight problem with the LCD, which is what prompted me to give it 4 stars and not 5. It came well packaged with all the parts (including screws, which were too long and too thin). It is fun to play with it and trust me is an instant hit with friends."
5,Value for money,"I have had this for over 4 years now. Still going strong. The darts broke after a while. But the board still works, no problem with the display.A Good buy"
4,good old memories,I dont have this anymore but i remember playing this alot with my ex fiance and it was a good board and fun. it come with darts of course and extra tips for when they start wearing out and the board is good because it doesnt keep poking holes in it till its swiss cheese. it comes with several games preloaded in its computer so it is really fun for friends and family.
3,Great built in games and battery life,Great built in games and battery life. It would have been better with additional darts. Jody Bissoon
3,dartboard,"I ordered this item thinking it was going to a great passtime for my husband and son and of course the price was terrific. However, when we attempted to put the darts together and try out the board the darts did not want to stick to the board.....we will keep trying it"
2,Ok for the occasional tosser,"But for someone that plays almost every day it's not that great of a product. First, you have to get your own darts, the ones that come with it are crap, but that's expected I suppose. Second, I've had an extraordinary number of bounce-outs, I change tips about every other night. And third, as the batteries get older the computer scores incorrectly, I'd never heard of a triple bull until I lost to it one night. But if it's going to hang in the basement and get played once or twice a month, it's probably decent for the money. [...]"
4,Kitchen gadget lover,"I recently bought this pan to start replacing my T-Fal that is starting to chip after only 5 years. I LOVE this pan. It works great for our family of 4. The clear glass lids are wonderful and nothing sticks to them. Clean up is a breeze and gets me out of the kitchen fast.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the handle on top of the lid gets very, very hot. Not a great idea, as a plastic one would work, but probably would melt if put in the oven.It was worth the money and am back to purchase another one at this great price!"
3,"Great nonstick pan, bad lid","This pan's nonstick properties are a league above Circulon's (my previous nonstick pan). It is incredibly easy to clean. The lid, however is a different story. The glass is easy enough to clean, but I have noticed that grease gets stuck in the grooves (where the glass meets the stainless steel). The pan alone is worth the price, so I would purchase it again. Otherwise, I prefer the Commercial Nonstick line, which has (one-piece) stainless steel lids."
2,"Disappointing - hot lid, burns food","The craftsmanship of the piece is very nice, however, I was disappointed by a couple of things:1. Even though the handle is nice and cool, the lid is metal and unfortunately gets very hot - it can be a big shock if you are not prepared. Too bad since they clearly have the technology to keep it cool.2. Compared to my other 2 1/2 pot (Wearever), this pot burns food a LOT more easily. I am not sure why - it seems water just evaporates faster in this pot. Sure the surface is non-stick, but it's no good when the food is burnt.It is a bargain, and the finish is nice, but ultimately a disappointment for me."
1,Size and Substance,"Two words. Glass Lid. Give me a break on the shallow. I've never used over 2.5 qts of sauce in any domestic cooking endevour. I can't handle having to watch(through the glass lid) well over 6/7ths a quart of sauce friviously simmer. I have traveled the necessary avenues with the manufacturers on placing a ""fill to here"" line on all saucepans. Please contact me via email and I will keep you abreast of all line updates.And that's a review!"
2,Huh?,"At first glance, this looks like a great piece of cookware at a great price. However, it's not without problems.(1) The glass lid. Have you ever cooked with a glass lid and greasy fingers? Have you ever had to clean up shards of glass from the kitchen floor while your kids and pets poked around, and then lost a perfectly good piece of cookware?(2) Do you REALLY want aluminum seeping into your food? That stuf is all kinds of poisonous.I don't think I'd recommend this, but if you're really careful and don't mind the aluminum part, this is a good buy."
4,(More Like 4 1/2 Stars) Good and Solid,"I'm very happy with this purchase. This is a heavy, well constructed saucepan. The coating has proved to indeed be non-stick as advertised. The domed glass lid, while not the see-thru asset I expected (steam prevents that), does help food retain it's moisture. For beginning gourmets, such as myself, the heaviness of the pan takes some getting used to when moving it about (I'm used to light-weight, less expensive cookware). Yet, the overall workmanship is reassuring (I'd be surprised if the lid ever breaks).I got this saucepan as a Gold Box purchase, at a price I now know to be a ..., and consider it a good introduction to fine cookware."
3,Lid is a problem,"I ordered this in October to add to a set my husband purchased. I had to have this one replaced, the lid was bent. I re-ordered and sent this one back, the lid looked OK so I stored it until use in December, not realizing the lid did not fit, now the box is gone and I cant send it back. I have a saucepan I cannot use with the lid. The handle on the lid gets very hot on this style and you must use a pot holder to open it. I wish I had chosen something different. My husband purchased a 10 piece set for me. I like it other than the lid, and you must make sure you use appropriate utensils so you dont scratch the surface. However;I did e-mail the company and they said they would send me a new lid and if they do they definitely stand behind their product, will let you know"
2,disapointment,I use calphalon for the most part. The lid on this producthas gaskets securing the handle to the lid. After very littleuse these gaskets fall apart from steam and heat making thehandle itself loose.
4,Songs written for a movie,It seems to me that bits and pieces of the songs on this CD were written for the movie then fluff added on to call it a complete song.
5,They are perfect for INDOOR stovetop smokers!,"Yes, it IS very thin slivers of wood, more like sawdust than chunks, but that's what it's supposed to be for a stovetop indoor smoker. Please ignore poster who gave negative review. It's clear he/she isn't familiar with such products. This product does precisely what it's supposed to do and does it well."
3,A little slow....,"This was a free kindle download so I figured I could not lose. I did end up finishing the book but I am very glad I did not pay for it. I think this story has such great potential I kept thinking "" Its going to get better "" but it really never did. It just seemed to go on and on at a sleepy sunday drive pace. I'm not sure why this author's writing style just did not engage me. I am used to lots of different fantasy writers poetry and long drawn out scene and character descriptions so that was not what bothered me. It just seemed ""flat"" and kind of boring."
1,NOT VERY USEFUL IN THE REAL WORLD,The techniques and stratgeys in the volume are just not workable or effective. I have been doing therapy for many years and had heard lots of praise from new therapists and some interns for this therapy....I was disapointed in this approach...
4,"Dark, depressing, you'll have a great time","Waking up in a body bag with amnesia, that can't be a good sign, but this is the first sign Tycho Caine recieves to an impending adventure. Tycho finds himself in Phoenix, Arizona, a dark and despressing city surrounded by a cape by the name of Frozen Shade. He qucikly finds himself to be a major pawn in a game for the calling of the Dark Ones into our world. He joins a band of agents of a person referred to by the name Coyote, Not only does Tycho have to stop whatever is trying to enter our dimension he also discovers he's the primary target for a traitor in the ranks of Coyote's group. The book is a little hard to get into, but once you're there you'll have a heck of a time. Stackpole builds a dark, depressing world and a plot that is kind of a hybrid of Blade Runner and Call of Cthulhu. This is truly a gripping book, if you like dark cyberpunk thrillers this is a good one to pick up."
4,Faithful to RPG,"If you are familiar with the RPG from GDW this book falls right in line with it. Mostly an action story with enough conspiracy theories to fill out the gaps, it's a simple, easy read. If that's what you want, give this a go. If, like me, you remember Dark Conspiracy fondly, you'll probably like it even more."
5,cover blurb says it all,"This book has got to have the best cover blurb of all time (get a copy and see!)This is one of Mr Stackpole's better books. One of the few I've read more than once. Depressing, realistic, detailed and exciting. It's also based on a game which really exists, called Dark Conspiracy."
3,From Back Cover,"Annie Darling, owner of the Death on Demand bookstore, is shocked to hear talk about her husband, Max, and a beautiful blonde. By the time she's faced down a hostile police chief and bailed Max out of Chastain, South Carolina, jail, the lady has vanished and Max is the prime suspect in an unspecified crime. The baffling, bloodstained trail leads straight to the doorstep of Tarrant house, home of a venerable Southern family with a violent history dating back to the Revolution - and ghosts of a far more recent vintage.Annie and Max find that the dignified facade of Tarrant House hides a hotbed of deadly passions as the family turns on itself in a mayhem of murdous motives and angry accusations. But in the end Annie must summon all her sleuthing skills to stop a desperate killer who is ready to strike again to keep the secrets that haunt the Tarrants from the light of day...[8th in the Death on Demand series]"
3,Somewhat bizarre,"It gets a little annoying when mysteries become politically correct and are used to make societal statements. If you are politically correct, try this and some of Nancy Pickard's books. They have the same effect."
5,Don't forget!,"What a great book. A fascinating subject, fabulous photos and a fun read. The authors give us condom history with a sense of humor. The photographs are wonderful, and the prices helpful."
4,Worth the Hype,"This was the stuff that made me say goodbye to pump bottle shaving creams. Overall a great product, but even with the smallest amount of brush to apply it lasted me at least 4-6 months. I'm a repeat buyer. I do with the cost was under $20 though."
2,You love the cover! What are you kidding?,"The cover doesn't, nor do the example in the book, suggest the potential for the modeling that is possible with formZ. I have read the previous reviews and read the book and understand the admiration for the attempt to write and easy example based tutorial manual, but the fact of the matter is that this book falls amazingly flat in opening a new users eyes to what, after a few months of using the program, they might be able to create. The admiration for this cover being the most blatent proof of this contention. For god's sake the potential for almost photo-realistic portrayls of space and objects is phenomenal and nothing in this book even approaches that kind of detail or even attempts it. FormZ is a powerful tool, one should try and convey this."
2,"Needs alot of work, but is better than nothing","Unfortunately, the author (who writes terrific reviews for software on CADence by the way) is not too good at writing an instructional book for FormZ. Granted, if you have a question, you can probably find an answer to it within this book, but good luck finding it. The organization is mediocre at best. The flow is haphazard and the author never gets the perfect mix of going from a)""This is what this feature does"" to b)""Try this as an example."" My advice to all computer book authors is to read George Omura's books and emulate what he does. THAT is the perfect way to both teach complete functionality while ""learning as you go."""
2,not for beginners after all,"When I encoutered this book I thought it would be the key to unlock the simple task of rendering architectural spaces for school. I was wrong. Coming from a background Photoshop, I thought this application that runs on Mac would be more user friendly, but it isn't and this book definitely has not helped me unlock some of the elementary skills. I have tried many nights to figure it out but sadly I am going to have to wait until some lab course at school opens the doors for me. Very hard to follow ""workshops."" No wonder it's on sale!"
3,"Nice pictures, but incomplete","When I saw the book in the store I was very impressed by the diagrams and illustrations. They are very clear and wonderfully descriptive. Also I was glad to read that the book was 'comprehensive' and covered form*Z 3.0 - I was hoping it would cover the new 3.0 features more in depth than the small addendum published by form*Z. While the book covered some subjects very well it was NOT comprehensive. It does not work well as a reference, and more importantly it does not cover the new features of form*Z animation well at all. The books gives only a few pages on animation - the manual is more useful. Also, in the case of a lot of other new renderering and modeling features, Into 3D with Form*Z seems to offer nothing in addition to the manuals.I recommed that if you are interested in getting a suplement to your form*Z manual or are looking for additional information on new 3.0 features, look elsewhere."
5,Great idea for girls sleepovers,"I absolutely love this book. I think it's so funny and yet at the same time it gives younger women answers to questions they were way to embarrased to ask, and on top of that you can finally stop wondering in the ack og your mind if your sexual relationships are the weirdest ones out there, 'cause there not."
4,"Nice to know what the ""other side"" is thinking","An interesting publication. Despite the first reviewers complaints about the literacy of Doctors and Lawyers, I think that there was plenty of information in the book. The survey was wide in scope and so were the answers which shouldn't be surprising as we all have our own ideas about sex.Perhaps a woman wouldn't get much out of it, but men will."
4,Great for older and younger children to watch together,My younger kids always want to watch a sing-a-long but my older boy finds them endlessly boring. This video has turned out to be a great compromise as it is not all cartoon and even has a few shots of dinosaurs. The Animal Kingdom Park is all about conservation so I didn't find the mentions about what people can do to help save wildlife habitats at all out of place and actually is a good conversation starter about environmentalism with the younger kids.
1,Utter Disney Drivel,Sadly this dvd was below what we have come to expect from the Sing A Long series. My 18 month old lost interest in this DVD after three minutes.I can not believe that I paid for this DVD that comes across as a blatant commercial to see Animal Kingdom.... and Animal Kingdom is worst park in Disney World.
2,"Little Gator in Gainesville, FL didn't care for video","My son is 15 months old and loves the Disney Sing Sing Along videos that feature the children singing. His favorite is Beach Party and I thought he would love the Animal Kingdom video. There is to much time between songs to keep his attention. Also, Flick gives short educational updates that break up the flow of the video. My friend's three year old daughter also found the video boring and I can't even give it away. In addition the quality of the photography involving lighting does not meet Disney's normally high standards. Maybe older kids would like it, but none of the adults that have watched along have cared for it."
2,Possibly the weakest Disney Sing Along Songs video,"This sing along tape is pretty uninspired, and for the undemanding kid. Or for the Disney Sing Along Songs completist.In this show hosted by Flik from A Bug's Life, you do get to see Disney's Animal Kingdom from Walt Disney World Florida, but the songs aren't really too impressive- either A Bug's Life or The Lion King related. Also, the words on screen seem to be a little delayed making it hard to sing along to.If you want to get your kids started with Disney Sing Along Songs I'd recommend another one.Suggestions: Friend Like Me from Aladdin, Zip A Dee Doo Dah from Song Of The South."
2,Didn't really need to hear the sermon,"This was really disappointing. We have all the other live action Disney sing alongs, in preparation for taking our 4 year olds to Disney World in February, and this one was not up to par. Fun at Disneyland is much better, as is Campout at Disney world. I didn't mind hearing about the different animals, but as soon as they announced the contest among the children to photograph the most dangerous animal, I just had to roll my eyes and *sigh* -- I knew a lecture about human encroachment was coming. Just in case anyone from Disney ever reads this -- I don't buy a Disney product for a sermon on environmentalism -- I can get that in the public schools. I buy Disney videos so that my children can enjoy the magic of Disney. They would have done better to stick with their established routine and not try to teach a lesson that any preschooler would have had to have been raised in a very dark cave not to have heard before."
5,Great sing-a-long for kids,"My two year old daughter loves this, as well as the other Disney sing-a-longs. Videos like this are difficult to find. Thank you Disney!"
5,Great book - everyone should read!,"Great book - read it after seeing ""Consider the Conversation"" - keep up the good work teaching people about what end-of-life is like and how it can be!"
3,Redundant,"Pros: The content was clearly well researched, contained several true stories, and was thought provoking. The book was also well written simply from a literary standpoint. He does have a compelling style. Also, I respected his personal lamentations on his own experiences with death, as they were powerful and gave a sense of credibility.Cons: Redundant/repetitive, no clear structure, and a little whiny at times. I agree that the way our healthcare system deals with death is insufficient, but I would have appreciated a more concise book, because it oftentimes felt like rambling. Sometimes less is more.I was going to purchase this for the unit manager of our hospice, but have decided not to simply because it is too repetitive. However, I am keeping the book for myself as there are several relevant points in the early parts of the book that I want to have access to for potential use in my nursing career."
2,Not much in the way of practial advice,"This book has a lot of stories about how the process of dying has been done badly, as well as a few stories about how it has been done well. There is a lot about how the current systems (health care system, insurance system, legal system, etc) make the process more difficult and painful. But not very helpful if you are looking for practical advice about how you can help do it better today.It was an easy read with a very enjoyable narative that did not get bogged down in jargon."
3,"Maybe it's good, just not for me.","As a longtime Drake fan, I jumped to hear an SACD of his music (never expected his own recordings would recieve that treatment at the time). I'm sorry to say, that this just sounds like jazzbos missing the emotional point of most of these songs. As Nick Drake tributes go, it ranks somewhere below ""Brittle Days"" for me.The sound, however, is lovely, with surround effects limited to setting you in an intimate space with performances well-recorded in front of you. The musical styles have a wide variety - there are no lounge lizards here. Listen to the sound samples before you jump."
4,great footage,"Alain de Cadenet is an engaging and qualified (having raced for Porsche and Ferrari, among others, in the 60's and 70's) host of this video which chronicles Porsche's racing from the beginning to the present. All the great cars are here: 904, 908, 917, 935, 962. Fantastic footage, particularly of the 60's - the segment with Brian Redman driving us through the Targa Florio is great. If there's anything to fault, it's the audio: mostly too soft and unfortunately does not capture the wonderful engine noises. The last few minutes where Alain talks about the Boxster and 996 are shot in video as opposed to film, and seem tacked-on and a bit too commercial. Otherwise, an excellent documentary."
5,surprised but pleased,"I bought this becuase I love Roxann Dawson, Lenard Nimoy, and John DeLance, and Ethan Philips. When I bought it, I didn't know that it was a reading on stage of The Lost World. It turned out to be fantastic. It is cool to see how they made all the sound effects. Definitely fun to watch!"
5,FANTASTIC!!!,"When I 1st saw the ""Alien Voices"" program on TV, I was greatly impressed by the performances not only by the main actors, but the ""Foley"" artists as well. I already have this and The First Men In the Moon on VHS, and am looking forward to purchasing the Halloween programs. This show got me re-interested in collecting the old radio shows such as War of the Worlds, the Shadow, and other classics..."
4,Delightful Story,"Dandelions on 240 North is a book that brought a world to me that seemed no less ""real"" than our own. The way David Schnieders' characters reacted to the realistic situations around them was simply superb. I could see children of that age in our world today acting just the same way in similar situations. Mr. Schnieders was clearly skillful in the way he presented the lives and enviroments of his characters.This book is one that I feel should not only be read by avid readers but those in school (especially middle school). I gave Dandelions on 240 North a 4 out of 5 because I loved reading about its characters and the problems they experienced throughout this delightful story."
5,"Different...as in ""special""","Having a selection of Benise's CDs as well as having seen them perform live,I can tell you that this is a very special group,with both a quality of musicianship as well as a variety ofmusical influences that set them apart from the rest of the""world-music"" crowd...if you like South American/Latin Americanmusic,with a healthy dose of spanish guitar and exotic percussion ,with a rhythm section that is both tasty AND tight,check out everything in the Benise catalog...you'll really enjoy it!"
5,Buy the entire Benise collection,"Benise is a must have. If you want to experience a new kind of music that will take you on a range of emotions and a musical journey like no other artist can then you must add Mediteranea to your collection.Judy,Jacksonville, FL"
1,YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Boring! Is it me or does all his albums sound the same? Benise is the McDonalds of the guitar world. Serving fast food music that lacks anything sophisticated! in short, it sounds that Ron Benise knows 4 chords and has used them over and over again in every album. Come on..."
2,I don't get it!!,"Lots of people giving this 5 stars? I don't getit. The first CD is really bad. I mean really terrible. The second and 3rd CD's have alot of great jamming but the sound is far from great. CD's 2 and 3 are worth many good listens but 5 stars and a good place to start? naaaa! Of the Picks I've heard so far, I'd say start with Vol 2."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I agree with Joshua Polak's review below - this is not a 5 star DP, in my opinion. What you get here are slow, low engergy renditions of a lot of the stuff that would come out on ""American Beauty"" and ""Workingman's Dead"", counterbalanced with normal, nothing special renditions of their standard late 60's stuff. Interesting solely for the historical reasons that the band was, in some ways, in transition - from the acid-soaked garage band of the late 60's to the more country-based sounds of the Hunter/Garcia duo that would come to typify the Dead for most of their working life. Other than that, this is a yawner. And if you want to hear something that'll make you literally cringe...give the Dire Wolf on disc 1 a listen. There's proof that they really did rehearse things in front of a live audience that they had barely ever played before. Just awful, painful stuff. For completists that want to have everything, even the leftovers."
4,ONE THING WORTH MENTIONING,"This volume includes one of the most beautiful ""We Bid You Goodnight"" ever recorded."
4,Fillmore 11/8/69,"Confused? Me too! However, just about every review I've read has at least something that will contribute to your critical understanding of this release. That said, the pervasive support for discs 2 and 3 reflect a unique and remarkably fluid run that make this show a must-have for any Head w/ more than just a casual interet - yep, I said it. If you're new - keep moving...check out the more ""accessible"" referrals by other reviewers or just go to dead.net or deadhook.com and ask. No need to recite the setlist - but take a good look at it: That interweave with Dark Star contains just the kind of tasty suprises you'd expect (I love the - albeit too short - 2nd DS>UJB Jam). Strong finish with a terrific WBYG & just-plain-sick TOYL. Beautiful."
3,Not my favorite,"I like Dick's Picks 26 from april '69 alot better than this. Disc 1 is a nightmare, and I usually enjoy at least half of the first sets of most shows, but this one just makes me cringe, ""Dire Wolf"" does NOT need to be 9 minutes long (or however long it is here, too damn long). Jerry's guitar sounds plunky and tone-less throughout the entire show, Contrast his guitar tone on here to Dick's picks 4, he is playing the same Stratocaster and amplifiers, and it is absolutely searing. But here it is dull and sustainless. Maybe it is just the recording, as the entire band sounds dull and plunky. It has it's great moments, as most all dick's picks do, but this one left me a bit cold."
3,"Fascinating information, but a tedious read","Mahl does an excellent job unearthing data that the British secret services sorely wish had remained secret. With copious footnotes, Mahl shows how Britain manipulated public opinion, lied to the American people, and subverted the democratic process. Mahl also demonstrates how Britain could not have pulled this off without the complicity of American Anglophile elites with stronger devotion to a foreign power than to their own country.While the information is interesting and well-supported, I found the writing style of this book to be tedious. Despite the fascinating material, this book is not written in a way that grabs your attention for a sustained read. Still, it's history, not a novel, so at least some of this is to be expected. If you have any interest in the intelligence field, and particularly the effect of covert operations on politics, policy and civil society, I recommend this book."
5,About learning the real challenges of dance,"Christine McDonnell's Ballet Bug tells of Bea, who thinks ballet is boring until a slumber party movie awakens her passion for dance. She enters a ballet class and learns the real challenges of dance as she struggles to catch up with her peers and faces a pair of vengeful twin competitors."
5,An excellent starting point,"This book is an excellent starting point for delving into Chinese history. From this book I was able to get a cursory understanding of the creation and evolution of the Chinese state and society. Although Chinese history is massive, this 300-page book manages to navigate the reader though the labyrinth without getting bogged in details and most importantly without losing the reader. This is no easy feat."
3,A Concise History of China,"I had this text for a class I took, therefore, I had to read it. It was a fairly good overview of Chinese history, but it wasn't written all that well. It was hard to get through and the author was very inconsistent with the amount, or lack, of details. I think that if you're considering buying this book that another one would be better."
2,Waste of great source material,"The history of China, from what I have heard and read, is a fascinating story. Chinese history, like most other history, proves that the best stories are true stories. Unfortunately, this is lost of JAG Roberts, the author of this book.I purchased this book to get an overview of Chinese history. But it was incredibly boring. The author packs so much information in such a small space, nothing is explored with any detail, feeling, or creativity.A good historical writer will propose a thesis in the beginning of the book and support that thesis. (ex. ""The Chinese Communists are a continuation of (or a break from) the old dynastic regimes"" or even something so simple as ""China has a long tradition of civilization"") Roberts does nothing of the sort. The reader merely gets a confusing outline of dynasties, leaders, and events in no narrative flow whatsoever, all without a purpose.It is not even entertaining."
3,Not as concise as I wanted,"I realize that China has a long history, but I needed more of a concise summary. I really didn't need to know the personal details of the various rulers 500 years ago. And I guess I was looking for more about China's interaction with the outside world and more about modern times.While I found the book interesting and informative, I disagree with reviews posted here that call it easy to read. It's written by a scholar... not by someone who can make things easily accessible.I made it all the way through the book but it was a chore."
1,Dull & poorly written!,This is an extremely simplistic historical outline that is very poorly organized & written. DO NOT BUY IT!
5,Why no Stephen Leather,"Stephen Leather has a great new book called The Stretch ,what a shame you cannot buy it on Amazon.. But you can get it through the U.K. site.All Stephen Leather books are a good read.fast paced with good story lines,and always well researched."
2,it's not Leather at all,"Stephen Leather is an exceptionally good writer but this book is not Leather at all.Though it has potential to develop the story to powerful climax, Leather gets soft overempasizing unrelated issues like Hutch's(main hero) girlfriend Chau Ling a daughter of a powerful magnet in Hong Kong.It gets so unbelievable to the point that Chau Ling can challenge the allmighty DEA in Thailland get away with it and have her way.Mercy Mr Leather,you have writen masterpieces like Hungry Ghost,Vets,Double Tap,Long Shot,etc.please do not ruin it with incorporating highly improbable events.Keep up the good work."
5,Drinking straight tequila,"Some of us remember the experience some of us don't, but Chris Cain helps us relive the moment or urge that got us there... He has a deep rich voice - wonderful for blues - great guitar and amazing energy. Don't pass up an opportunity to see him live. A blues experience to be remembered no hangover involved."
4,Great band,"The band is slammin, however all the songs are mislabeled. What is song 5 is really song one, etc... Is it just my cd???? Other than trying to figure out what song is which, it's a great album."
1,it's a research paper,"I'm not sure exactly how to review this book. I bought it sight unseen and without having read any reviews of it. From the title, I hoped this was an historical and archeological look at changes in pueblo architecture at Orayvi (Oraibi) over the course of its use. I assumed it would cover things like changes in building materials, design, and pueblo orientation over the past 600 to 800 years.However, this book looks at one specific question - how did pueblo room sizes, numbers, and usage change from the 1880s to the 1940s? It covers that in great detail, but reads very much like a graduate thesis. That is, it's very dry reading and repetitive.If you are an archaeologist studying puebloan sites, you probably already have the book. If you're an interested lay person (like me) it's probably not going to satisfy you."
3,Nostalgic Fun,"Talk about a blast from the past! Intellivision was one of my favorite game consoles in the early 80s, so when I heard about this title I jumped at the chance to own it.The graphics are of course laughable by today's standards, but the games still hold up as fun and (for the most part) inventive, if not exactly challenging.And in addition to over 30 games, this title also has interviews with the programmers, a vido segment telling the history of Intellivision, and bonus commercials that you can unlock by achieving goals in some of the games.One negative is that only Intellivision titled games are present in this collection, so no Microsurgeon or Atlantis or AD&D; (the best game for the sytem).However, there are still a ton of classic and fun games, including: Space Battle, Sea Battle, Utopia, Snafu, and Astrosmash."
4,Brings me back to my gaming days,"Yes this game could have been made much better .. but if you're a true old school gamer, it's the nostalgia that matters. This game brings me back.. 4 out of 5 stars."
1,Only For Nostalgia.,"To be honest, I liked this game, but for %99 of you that did not grow up with this game system, walk away."
2,"If you want a great compilation of games, look elsewhere because all this is is a botched up advertisement.","Intellevision Lives attempts to bring the player back in the 80's but this seems more like an advertisement than a game. The soundtrack songs are corny and sound like radio advertisements. The graphics of the games still remain blocky and the new graphics added were poorly done too. The presentation is crappy. It sets the player in a diner which has 5 Intellevision arcade machines. This game fails to provide decent bonus content as well. There are 60 games in here and due to so many, you would enjoy them in short bursts, but there is only one problem. The frustrating controls which never seem to explain themselves.To sum it up, this game is a great collection, but it was too rushed up and that was it's downfall. Look elsewhere for a decent compilation."
1,Lame - Don't waste your money/time.,"I've purchased games that turned out to be less than expected, but this one beats them all. As noted in other reviews, the graphics suck, and the controls are beyond all attempts to describe the level of suckiness. If you're looking for some old school arcade games that are half decent, get Namco Coliseum or Midway Arcade Treasures."
2,Beware,"I couldn't get my hands on a copy of Windows 2003 Small Business Server, so I opted for installing Windows 2003 Server on my server. After wiping out Red Hat Linux, and installed without any major problems. After several hours of patching and applying hot fixes (and rebooting), I was up and running.However, I found 2003 Server unusable for my purposes (thankfully, I got an evaluation copy instead of the full, non-refundable version).I wanted to make it the primary domain server so I could manage my PC accounts better. I also wanted to make it a file server, email server and web server. Unfortunately that is where the problems started.Windows 2003 Server cannot be a Primary Domain Controller without Active Directory Services. Active Directory Services cannot run without DNS services. I ended up giving up and going back to Linux and Samba (which will act as an NT4 style PDC).Yes, 2003 does have a lot of features, but for users who like Win 2k and/or Linux, the benefits may not be worth it."
1,Not recommended,"I would stay away from this product! I am running a dual Xeon 2.4 Ghz with 2 gigs of ram and a RAID 5 controller, and can't get the operating system to install, it simply locks up. There is no tech support for this product Microsoft says to go back to were you purchased it for support. Once you break the product seal there are no refunds. SO I am stuck with a $1,200 piece of software that doesn't work and still have to go out and purchase software that does. Your best bet is to not risk $1,200 that is usless.I have been working with computers since 1978 so I am no amateur to operating systems.Kent,"
1,Stick with WIndows 2000 Server,WIth all the Updates WIndows 2000 Server is a stable os and needs no upgrade to a costly new product like 2003 server.Save your money and stick with what you have.
5,Gives Good Coverage,"Worked very, very well after a knee replacement. My physical therapists said I got the best kind there is for reducing swelling and maintaining temperature and adequate coverage.."
3,cold pac,a very good product---works as advertised. does a wondferul job in rehabing injuries--it's very cold but tolerable. You can you it after workouts as well for quick muscle recovery....highly recommend it
2,A little too busy!,"I love Celestial Seasonings rooibos based teas--in particular their Madagascar Vanilla Red, and Moroccan Pomegranate. Red Safari Spice tries to do too many things and creates a busy blend that did not grab me. The combination of fruit and spice was just not tasty--and I am not a fan of banana flavoring in tea.Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.Quote from the box: ""In all things of nature there is something of the marvelous."" Aristotle."
5,Red Pepper Tea?,"Before I tried this tea I couldn't imagine a tea with red pepper in it and now this is one of my favorite Celestial Seasonings blends. The red pepper has a fruity rather than peppery taste and along with the other fruity flavors, I find it a very enjoyable blend."
5,I Love This Tea,"I'm a tea drinker exclusively--in the morning it's black tea, and in the afternoons and evening, this is my #1 favorite herbal. The perfect blend of spicy with just a hint of sweet, it's delicious on its own, and fantastic with a cinnamon cookie."
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this game since I'm a big fan of pinball and a huge fan of the movie Lilo and Stitch. I loaded the game and it was entertaining for about 10 minutes. There are three levels of the same table, one for kids, adults and pinball wizards, which translates to easy, medium and tough difficulty levels. My disappointment with the game is it only contains one table and no content. I expected multiple levels or maybe even a cut sceen or two. This software title is extreemly lacking in development, content and is a disappointment from other Disney Interactive titles. This would have been better as a freebee of Disney's website or even an extra on the DVD."
1,Be Aware.,"We recently purchased this software game for our children. They played & enjoyed it. The next day, when I went to boot up the PC, I had this error message waiting for me on the screen:""ERROR: error loading explorer.exeYou MUST reinstall windows""What a headache. I had no windows. I had no data. All was lost! I spent hours just trying to get the PC back to normal. I didn't know why or what had happened....until my daughter reinstalled this software again, so she could play it, and the exact same thing happened all over again.A real bad glitch is in this software! Be careful & be aware that this could happen to your PC."
5,a excellant book for beginers,"I like this book although it might lack certain information on several important battles in medieval europe it does however make up with it's beautiful illustrations. I would say this is a good book for people who want to make it simple, and for the serious reader I suggest reading Medieval Warfare: A History. In all even to some it might be a tad bit steep but you wouldnt be disappointed."
3,Needed more discussion on the Islamic history,"Although the term ""Middle Ages"" often referred to the European age of transistion, other important events went on the other side of the Mediterranean Sea where Islamic science and culture advanced beyond western's comprehension. Apart from the short descriptions on Reconquista, Crusades, and Ottoman Empire (Devlet?), not much were looked into the making of Islamic history.The appreciated work reflects the serious research done by the authors but discrepancy on Islamic historical accounts slightly missed the ""edge""."
5,Master Class,"This is one of many Masterton books that are just brilliant. I have a collection of paperback versions of Masterton's works, and I have been consistently impressed by his ability to scare.If some enterprising person would just option Masterton's works, we might find a breed of Horror film that surpassed many works.From the initial discovery of the demons, through the moves to the denoument of this tale, this book delivers chills in the best possible way.So few writers now-a-days can even come close to Masterton's first person delivery. I hope that Masterton's older works will eventually get re-printed in hard-back, since they are worth keeping.This book, along with WELLS OF HELL, and TENGU, are but one of a few that can deliver a few sleepless nights. Sheer magical fun from the greatest modern horror writer, bar none."
5,The scariest book I've ever read!,This book is a little old now as I read it years ago. I can wholeheartedly say that this is the ONLY book that scared me enough to prevent me from switching the light off! Masterton is the king of describing events in such detail that they're almost believable. Where does he get his ideas from! Does any other author come close? James Herbert is a pretty close second. King and Koontz are in Division two by comparison.
2,I was really disappointed with Sing a Song with Pooh Bear.,I would not recommend this video. Disney should be disappointed in itself for realeasing this substandard work. The animation was poor and did not seem to match in places--almost as if previous works were edited together with the new material surrounding the songs. The songs were not very cute and the characters appeared to have a hard time in singing and keeping in tune with the music. I have purchased other sing along videos from Disney and believe that these are put together much better than this Pooh video despite the fact that most of their material has been recycled from other movies and cartoons.
5,Pooh at his best,This is a very cute sing a long. My 2 year old loved it and sang a long with the songs. This is a typical pooh cartoon set to the winnie the pooh music. A must have for any child who loves winnie the pooh and his friends.
5,Pooh is awesome....my kids drove me nuts singing to this,This is a must for Pooh lovers. Young and Old will be singing along with Pooh.
4,fun video for little ones..,"very fun.. good colors, songs and dances... i gave only 4 stars due to so much time wasted at beginning of tape for ads, and previews and commercials. actual movie is way less time then expected."
5,Our favorite sing along!!,"This video is by far my little girls favorite! (and we have lots to choose from) The story line is cute and they have included all the classic Pooh songs along with a couple we had never heard but soon came to love! Our favorite is ""The Kangaroo Hop"" my daughter loves to bounce and sing along! And even I catch myself singing the tunes long after we've played the tape! One of those rare videos that you never get tired of! It's a keeper!!!"
1,Shows the degeneration of Disney's Pooh,"The original Disney Pooh films were charming, and showed appreciation for the gentle humor and poetry of the original books. Since then, there's been a steady slide into garish slapstick. This compilation of musical sequences (some borrowed from old films, some new) is proof of the decline. Kids may enjoy it, but adults with taste will probably be wincing."
4,Sooper Dooper,"The music is extraordinarily good as well as the video. Just fascinating to a two year old who wants to see and hear it over and over again. I would give it a five star rating but to get to the main presentation, one must go through almost ten minutes of previews.In the entire Winnie the Pooh series, this tops them all by far. A masterpiece."
2,Not made in the US,"Note that the 94A ball valves are the Apollo ""economy"" series and are not made in the US. Quality is about on par with other generic made-in-China ball valves. The one I received had a loose stem packing nut from the factory and it leaked when opening/closing. After removing the handle and tightening the nut it no longer leaks."
3,Black/Gold vase,The vase was a great addition to my mantle until I lifted it up by the handles and one of them came unglued and broke. I had to repair it as best I could. I then place it back on the mantle with the broken area facing toward the back as not to be seen.
2,Take a cold shower,"This is an attractive book: good quality paper and pretty pictures, but there are many other cookbooks that really deliver the goods.If you think this is a cookbook to spice-up the bedroom, then the answer is ""maybe."" If you want to use this to get some good recipes, the answer is ""no."" And if you want to buy this to look at the pictures, then the answer is ""you can do better.""Don't be fooled by the title - there are other consumer goods that have been sold by sex in the past."
4,Beautiful.,This cookbook is gorgeously sexy. An old roomate introduced it to me years ago and I fell in love with the idea of food in this context. The photography completely makes the book--beautiful!
4,The cook book you can't put down!!,"All I can say about Intercourses is ""WOW""! Not only are the recipes devine, but the photographs are amazining. This cookbook is an artform!The cuisine is both delicious and erotic, and as soon as you read this book you will want to cook! I mean, everyone knows that oysters and strawberries are aphrodisiacs, but pine nuts? You will learn some interesting ways to get your love life cooking. I definitly advise you read this book, if not for yourself, then for the person your cooking for!"
2,"Pretty fun, when the recipes work","It's a fun book, but may not be for the cooking amateur. I tried making the French Toast and am completely convinced that the recipe is completely fake. My result was nearly inedible and normally I would blame myself for my failure, except that some key things which were supposed to happen such as the bread puffing up, did not. I would still recommend this book for your coffee table though."
4,Great idea!!,"This is a wonderful and EASY way to spice things up with your special someone. The recipes are easy and fun to make. Couldn't say for sure they work as well as claimed, but it's sure fun trying!"
4,Great - kept me awake despite a raging Hangover,"I saw this at a convention 2 years ago, just after it had been made, and it is great! It is a bit more than just a plain reading and a bit less than an actual play, you COULD watch it with your eyes closed - or just get the audio version! - but you would be missing out on a lot of the facial expressions and body language - great"
4,Just give'er,"You are now in Terry and Dean's world. Follow them as they smash, crash, splash their way through life with the motto that ""You just have to give'er."" It is a documentary, mocumentary or is it real life? You never know. The website doesn't help you decide. Snort beverages through your nose as you laugh your way through this soon to be cult classic. ""Whether the doctor says pain or the forecast says rain....it's Friday night so I'm just gonna giv'er."" Definitely not for the yuppy crowd."
2,waynes world meets drunk canadians,I am actually more fond of the sequel but this is a must watch if a fan of canadian humor
4,"""Fubar"" product review","Funny movie. A little dry, a lot trashy, but an entertaining mockumentary nonethless of two Canadians living their dream together."
1,Very misleading,DVD had several deep scratches causing itto freeze throughout the film. This DVD didnot advertise it having any scratches. Extremely annoyed and will not be ordering from this person again
4,a strong show... thank you Mr. Hornsby,"This is a solid 90's show, although it does not represent the best of this era. Bruce Hornsby inspires the band to play well, set list is great, rest of the band is in good form."
2,A Real Disappointment,"A good-looking setlist, but a sadly uninspired gig. The first set is OK, nothing great, but not bad either. The second set is sloppy and sluggish, the jamming short and undeveloped. Using two keyboard players on this gig clutters up the sound, Bruce Hornsby's piano is high up in the mix and he clatters away with little regard to the mood of the songs, and hits an appalling bum note in 'Terrapin Station' that ruins the whole song. The bonus marathon 'Eyes of the World' is good, but it's not worth paying out for this and an OK first set. There must have been better Dead gigs of this period that should have been released instead."
2,Typical early '90s,A somewhat lost Garcia being overpowered by well-played but horrid-sounding keyboards. The rest of the band is merely adequate. It earns better than one star b/c I'm saving that for the first '95 release.
4,Nice Evening,This was a beautiful evening and the DP package is nice. Disk 2 is a favorite. 9/20/91 would have been a better choice with the Help/Slip/Fire.
4,solid90's show,"Dont knock al the nineties shows, there are some godd shows including this one. Solid all around. I am burnt out on 70's shows and enjoy the variety this dead show provides. Solid ""queen jane"" and ""terrapin"". ""eyes"" is from another show and quite exellent. If you like Live Without a Net this is better."
2,Blueberry smell.. weird taste.,"This tea definitely smelled like blueberries but upon tasting it, it was a very sour /bitter taste to me despite not over steeping the tea. It almost tasted like cough syrup. added a bit of organic sugar and it tasted a bit better. Maybe I Just don't like herbal / fruit flavored teas."
4,Best Tea Ever,I have loved Celestial Seasoning's True Blueberry tea forever and I finally decided to make sure I didn't run out for awhile. Buying the 6-pack of twenty bag boxes should last a couple of month. And a great price too!
5,blueberry Heaven,"a huge discount on a delicious blueberry flavored tea. Natural and no caffeine. How can you go wrong? This tea with some honey in a mug morning, day, or night. Its perfect! Also try the Peach tea. But blueberry still has my vote for number 1. TY Celestial."
5,My favorite tea!!!,"Damn, I'm hooked on this fantastic tea. I usually drink it with 3-5 packets of Splenda or Equal, and I'm up to 4 or 5 cups of it a day. I guess I should be a little worried about my artificial sweetener intake, but I can't help it this tea is so darn addictive. I've tried all of Celestial Seasoninings other herbal offerings and I would list them in this order of preferenceBlueberry -> Cherry -> Raspberry -> Multiberry -> Peach (yucky aftertaste on this one)."
2,"Blueberry aroma, not taste","Don't buy this tea if you are looking for the blueberry taste (I was). This tea does have the very nice blueberry fragrance for a minute or two, but the taste is mostly hibiscus, which is nice, but far from blueberry."
2,not a true blueberry flavor,"this has a very strange taste, not a blueberry taste at all, at least not concerning my taste buds. Bigelow is much better."
5,Blueberry,"Blueberries. I could eat blueberries all day. I guess I need to move to Maine just so I'd be near all those blueberries.This blueberry-flavored tea is mouth-watering and quenching. I put the bags in my water bottle, and the bottle goes in the freezer until ice shards begin to form. Then I can drink it. I even tried this blueberry tea with sparkling seltzer water, and it is really good.The rich blue packaging is also appetizing."
4,Truely Blueberry,"On a cold night, when I want something warm, with no caffeine, Celestial Seasonings True Blueberry herbal tea hits the spot. Wonderful berry flavor. Add a bit of sweetening and it's the perfect hot drink. It also makes a very good iced tea. I can't keep enough of these around the house. This tea is even flavorful enough to drink without sweetening."
1,Don't waste your money,"Anyone with any experience running simulation will not find anything in this book besides frustration. System C examples are woefully incomplete, without even one useful example. The authors attempt to describe semi advanced techniques without even laying out the basics of instantiating a complete test bench structure properly. About the only thing useful are flow charts of a proper testbench."
2,not good,This book is not good at all. Poorly written and incomplete and typos in examples/illustrations. Most of the examples are written in test Builder even though the book says SystemC Based Approach. Many of the concepts in verification methodology can be found in other verification books and this book adds very little value.
1,This mini size is just too small,This mini size is just too small. I ordered 3 of the items and wanted to return them but I took them FOREVER to get back to me how to return them. All in all it was a not a good buying experience for me.
2,Nixon - Double-crossed again,"Richard Nixon, in his lifetime, had the poor judgment to explicitly trust people who would sacrifice him for their own interests - John Dean, Al Haig, Henry Kissenger, and now Monica Crowley. How sad that she would bring such harm to this noble man by selling him out for the price of a book publishing. She paints him as a selfish and senile old has-been who so resents having lost his place on the national scene that he plots against those who have taken his place. She might pay better attention to the books she helped him write. They show the ""real"" Nixon far better than the tarnishing she gives him in this book. Better that she had stopped with her first book. It may have been simple, but it wasn't cruel."
1,Plagarism is not nice,"A lot of this book is plagarized. Crowley regularly ""borrows"" whole paragraphs from other authors. She just did this again on her radio show. I wouldn't waste my time on this book."
2,noisy,not for the serious dart player....electronic voice is annoying and there is no way to turn it off. the sound the darts make when they hit the board is also loud and very fake.this would be a great product for kids but not adults.
2,Next year hire actors that can act and a director that can direct,"A good story, plot, and scene selection which highlights both the conflict of homosexuality with a traditional, orthodox Jewish family and the coming out process of their oldest son. However, the movie is ruined by poor, over-acted performances by the physically attractive principals and over-the-top stereotypical ""Jewish-ghetto"" behavior by the parents, uncle, grandfather, and rabbi. The best, and most believable performances are delivered by the broken fiancee and the two brothers. The camera angles and lighting in the home apartment scenes are distracting and someone should have told them to turn off the ceiling fan / light combo during shooting! The obvious low-budget does not distract from the storytelling but the acting does."
3,Not Perfect but a great try,"While the production value of this film is questionable, the writting is very solid. It tells a difficult story about difficult issues and treats these issues pretty well. Considering that this is the director's first try he had done a very good job. I have to question the review about this film needing a shower and a change of clothes, I can not imagine that this person actually watched the film."
4,Accurately portrays the feelings of the gay Frum Jew,"While some of the acting and production values may illicit chuckles, the film really nails the feelings of a religious person recognizing the 'unacceptable' in themselves and learning to live with and accept it"
4,Fascinating,This novel put me on the edge of my seat!The plot was filled with twists I wouldn't have expected. The next book is even better!!
5,The best in teh series so far!,"Very exciting book, excellent plot, wonderfully written - I could not put it down!!! I can't wait to read the 5th book to see in what kind of trouble Rachel Morgan gets into next!"
4,A fast adventure with a likable heroine,"Rachel Morgan, a witch working as a private investigator (of sorts) in a world where supernatural creatures ""came out of the closet"" is a likable axis of this adventure. Tough in combat, using humor to combat her fears, and vulnerable to her friends and love interests, she involves the readers in her problems and victories. The supporting characters are colorful, and sometimes interestingly three-dimensional.As before in this series, the plot is fast and full of confrontations, there are good allies as well as bitter enemies; and possibility of deceit is always present. The plot is heavily involved with shape-shifters, and Rachel is getting more involved with their supernatural politics in this installment.The book comes to a satisfying conclusion, but leaves plenty of threads, and reader interest, for more sequels."
2,Downward spiral,"I thought the series was OK, & like many thought it had potential. But, each book seemed to get more slow moving than the previous. Also, not really enough romance for me, and Rachel's actions contradict her thoughts so much that she can seem trivial at times. It gets annoying."
3,Somewhat disappointing...,"I always enjoy a visit to the Hollows but this one left me a little disappointed. I do not want to see Rachel become mired in the same goo in which Laurel Hamilton has placed Anita Blake. Anita went from being a strong decisive character who solved mysteries to star of badly written pornos. As a previous review stated, I also think of the situation with Ivy as a subplot and not a very interesting one. Also, the idea that Rachel is an adrenaline junky demeans the relationships she has developed and makes her appear shallow. I loved Kist and Jenks and hope to see more of Trent. Hopefully, in the next book, Rachel will have more substance. I have really liked this series and would hate to see it fall apart now."
3,Sadly lacking. Wish it weren't.,"And it's not to say this is a bad book; it isn't. It still trumps anything Laurell can write, with a hand and two feet tied behind its back. The focus on Nick and how he isn't the normal human they thought he was is perfectly fine, and not surprising. The fact that he gets his arse handed to him is great, because he has it coming. But the almost total exclusion of Kisten is a disappointing shame, considering it took three books to get him where he is, and he gets shunted off for the ex. And the blood tryst subplot is deplorably ridiculous. Rachel has been adamant about not sharing blood and has been traumatized because of her demon attack, but in the back of a van she has a revelation? Give me a break. And the explanation of her inviting danger to keep herself feeling happy is laughable. I could see Anita Blake being pinned with this, but Rachel Morgan? Uh, no. Way to turn your character into a sad little masochist. The next book will hopefully be better."
3,maybe a fistful of ideas would of been better,This is the weakest story so far.The plot taken out of the Hollows suffers beacause the characters are out of the area they know.The only good thing is that Nick is out . What happens to Jenks is almost like a desperate ploy to gain sympathy and pad out somthing that you know will come back to haunt in another book. Hopefully a better one than this.Miss this book out and keep the others!!!!
4,Pretty Good Read,"This was a pretty good read. Especially if you are like me and are depressed about the way LKH has proceeded with the ""Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter"" series (i.e., LKH has destroyed it and doesn't even have plots anymore). At least Kim tries to put together a real story with a plot and everything. <sad smile>"
2,Very Disappointed,"I loved the first three Rachael Morgan books. When I picked up this book I got out the first three plus and sat down to read them all in order.I started with Ivy's short story in Dates From Hell which was OK, then went to the first book which was good. The second book was better - you could see some character improvement. By the time I finished the third book I was really excited.One quarter of the way in I became very disappointed. I disliked the turn that Ivy's and Rachael's relationship took. I missed Kist and Trent etc.. The writing didn't seem as sparkly.I don't know if I'm going to buy another book in this series because I feel it may have jumped the shark. And that makes me sad because I truly cared about the characters."
2,I think I'm sick of this series,"I like Rachel a lot, and Jenks was great, but I am so sick of Ivy! She's beautiful, powerful, and it's still not enough. The ongoing tension between Ivy and Rachel has just put me off these books. It never moves forward. Until Ivy gets over herself, I can't read anymore."
4,"if you didn't like nick before, you're going to hate him especially after this book.","This book is the next in the series for Kim Harrison's good but oh-so-bad girl witch. I've been rather impressed with Harrison's series so far and the characters are very easy to become attached to. Harrison is very good at creating both unique characters that haven't been very thought up before and taking existing personas and giving them new twists within the series. I big on the vampire/dark fantasy books. I would definately recommend going out and giving this series a try. The action within the series is fun to read and Harrison has a very inventive mind.If you like Anita Blake, you're more than likely to like this series too. =)"
2,This one is way off track,"I love Kim Harrison's world of the Hallows and the interesting characters she has created. However, Fistful of Charms is not a good addition to the series. The focus of the book on Weres was just not interesting to me and I think removing the setting outside the Hallows was not interesting either. How about a book set in another city's ""Hallows"" instead? Also, I must be the only reader who is getting tired of all the angst around Ivy. Why not just hook her up with someone interesting and work out of the whole Rachel/Ivy will they or won't they routine. I'd hate to see Harrison start going off track into Laurel Hamilton territory--a writer I used to enjoy but now wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. Ms. Harrison has developed wonderful materials to go forward with--like Keasley and Ceri--let the Hallows rock!"
1,My last read....,"I'm sorry but this is my last book in this series. I never liked uptight, high strung, poor me looney Ivy - Rachel had to be careful around her all the time for fear she would insight her blood lust, that's a friend? And then there was Rachel always going off hell bent for leather like she was omnipotent. Well Ivy finally almost drained her dry in this book and when I found myself not caring at all I realized it was time to quit."
3,A Fistfull of Charms,"The best I can say about this bok is that it was better than it's predecessor. It wasn't exactly bad but it wasn't nearly as god as the first two of Ms Harrison's Hollows series.Nick was totally out of character when compared with the first two books. I just didn't buy it. Trent was totaly absent which disappointed me since I find the relationship between him and Rachel to be one of the most interesting in the series. Rachel's angst over her relationship with Ivy is getting tedious. It's been going on for four books now, enough already. I've also been hoping that she would explore the social dynamics between humans and Interlanders. Granted that humans are quite literaly at the bottom of the food chain and the Interlanders probably don't care what their next meal feels about the situation but the total lack of any look at the dynamics of the two species annoys me."
2,Thought these would be better,"Eh...This was passable. Something about this just didnt grab me.The action was okay. The characters went places and did things, which is what you look for.I just didnt find many of the personal interactions among the main cast very engaging, or compelling.I will probly try a few more of these, but I think the bloom is off this series."
4,Good But Not Great,"I enjoyed this book although not as much as prior books in this series. In my opinion this book has less action and suspense than the previous books. That being said, I would still recommend it. It moved the story forward and I do look forward to the next installment."
2,Great series. Weak book.,"I think my great disappointment with A Fistful of Charms is exasperated by the great appeal of the previous books in the Hollows series. The old charm just isn't evident here. Firstly, AFOC isn't set in Cincinnati. Trent and Al--important characters to the evolving story--are absent. Ivy, Rachael, and Nick read like entirely different characters from one book to the next. Finally, there is the hundred odd pages of yelling. Everyone seemed so nasty. A good story need not focus on likeable characters in order to be enjoyable; however, they should still draw one into their story.Essentially, all the good ingredients in the Rachael Morgan series are missing."
4,Strongest book in the series,"Harrison's strongest book yet, this one is a pleasure to read. She tilts the balance between plot and character development a little more toward character in this book, without going to the unfortunate lengths that have plagued the later Anita Blake books. I really enjoyed the developing story with Ivy; it's well done but doesn't overshadow the plot, which is a fun one.The book seems to be a bit better edited than the previous ones (which weren't great examples of the craft of editing) but, still, when you come across howlers like ""mute point,"" it's really hard not to wince and get pushed out of the story, however briefly. Even basic proofreading ought to catch something like that, let alone professional editing.Still, if you like this genre, I highly recommend the series, and this book in particular."
5,Great Book! Suprise ending LOVE jenks!,"Well this one was not as good as the others in some ways but greater in others.I loved Jenks in this book and we learn a wee bit more about ms. mysterious Ivy.Racheal is getting on my nerves though, becasue she keeps second guessing herself and worrying too much about the charms she does. And she was STUPID to get Ivy to bite her and seperate out love/sex/ect.. with her bloodlust.Grrrr.. But i am eagerly waiting the next and Racheal is NoT Anita Blake (ms. I am always horny worship me) so, i am pleased...Lookiing foward to the next ones and will definetly purchase them new and not used or library read."
2,Good Story but the Main Character Sucks,"I am late in starting this series but I just have to comment on this book.The story is great and I love where it is going however, Rachel, the main character, is the worst written character I have ever read and I have been reading for a LONG time. The first 3 books she was bad but this one, she is horrible and I am debating on continuing because of her.Rachel Morgan aka Witch, is flat out stupid! She is a condensending, self centered moron and the way the author explains away her faults is just rediculous.I have the next book in the series so I will read that one but if the character of Rachel does not change, it will be the last one I read in this series because as much as I like the story and the secondary characters, I just cant stomach Rachel. I find myself throwing the book down in disgust."
2,Super Reader,"Best thing about this book is probably the cover. It is way too long and padded, and barely anything happens. Extremely disappointing after the first ones, and definitely showing signs of deterioration. It is also definitely showing signs of needing editing.A book like this shouldn't be 500 pages long I am pretty sure. Lame, and lacking in adventure. Give it a miss."
1,Horrible,"I loved the previous three books in the Rachel Morgan series but this one was horrible. Very boring, lack of character development, and horrible character voice. I hated this book. I think Kim Harrison has ruined her books! I am sorely disappointed. The plot is awful. It is poorly written."
3,A Pre-Retirement Book,This was a book bought on the recommendation of a friend. It was not general enough to apply to many people.
1,Terrible Formatting & Poor Content,"The format of this book is horrible!! The content is formatted like you might expect with Questions and Answers. Unfortunately, the author doesn't keep it simple. Instead you will find ""Green Light"" and ""Red Light"" examples and poorly written content within slightly humorous titles. I don't have the time to go into great depth but if you want a more serious publication on interviewing then I suggest: ""The Complete Q&A Job Interview Book"", Jeffrey G. Allen. The formatting and content complement each other well.Best of luck to you!"
4,The President's Counselor: The rise to power of Alberto Gonzales,Excellent book with great background information on Bush as well. The Texas politics parts are fascinating. A really good writer. I hope he does a follow-up on Gonzales and his role in the government in the nearer past.
5,The Senders CD,You really have had to be part of the downtown NY music scene in the early 80s to remember these guys but they were a terrific rock band that never quite 'made it.' I always wondered what happened to them and found them of all places on Facebook. They have their own site and the music is as good as I remember.
2,Not a practical book,This is a book which explores the combination of colored pencil with a myriad of other techniques. This is a book for the advanced colored pencil artist wishing to expand their horizons. Definitely not a how to book- not very practical.
2,Some dry reading,An incredibly dry introduction of basic IIS functions. It manages to stay away from any in depth knowledge of the product and does fine on basic administration and use of MMC.
3,So Far So good,"Well to be honest I didn't rely on just the Microsoft Press book to pass the IIS 4 test. You may want to read a study exam cram in addition to the IIS press book. Plus bone up on plenty of SQL and ODBC. I am hoping the Proxy is as easy as everyone has said. I will probably duplicate the same effort, study both the cram and study guide along with the transcenders. I am hoping this strategy will make good a sixth time."
2,You'll never pass the IIS 4 exam if you only depend on this,"Easy to follow, but far from complete to pass the exam. I noticed the average reviews were much higher than mine. I can only guess that MS changed the structure of the exams. Very heavy emphasis is now placed on SQL, ODBC & SQL error codes, and similar items that are just not covered in this book. To be fair I should say that most books I viewed in the books stores don't cover this material. Check the Microsoft exam points on their web site. You'll need more than just this book to pass."
3,Buy it (if you've other ressources for exam preperation)!,"I bought this book (before i decided to go the MCSE track) to learn something about IIS 4. I had to administer IIS 4 in our company and therefore i needed some more information. This book covers nearly all of the daily operations done with IIS 4, but doesn't go beyond the surface. So don't expect too much. For the IIS exam, it's not enough. You can combine this book with a bunch of daily work experience, then you'll be able to handle the exam. And don't forget to read the online help, which covers most of the topics! For the MCSE track it's a good idea to buy this book at the beginning, because together with IIS 4 you also get an evaluation copy of NT 4 Server, SQL 6.5 and Proxy 2."
2,Content is dry and varies in subject coverage...,"This is one of the driest books I have ever read. The covering of IIS subject material is a real roller coaster ride. One chapter will go into fair detail about a particular aspect of IIS while other chapters barely even cover other key areas of IIS. I can't recommend using this kit alone in preparation for the IIS exam. Definitely purchase OTHER recommended books to supplement your reading. The main reasons to purchasing this kit is that you get a 120 day evaluation copy of NT Server 4.0 along with IIS 4.0, and Proxy Server 2.0. Also, this kit covers two tests (IIS and Proxy) instead of just one. The second reason to buy it is to give you that warm fuzzy feeling that you are reading ""Official"" Microsoft content. You could download IIS and Proxy from Microsoft but having the CD's handy might save you time and frustration. Summary: If you have the extra cash and don't have the needed software then it is definitely worth purchasing this kit."
1,Don't buy unless you need the software.,"I bought this because of the negative reviews for almost all IIS 4 MCSE books. I found this kit lacking in detail, inaccurate on some basics, and not very exciting. I reviewed books not targeted for the MCSE exam and bought ""Administering IIS 4 by Mitch Tulloch"" Mr. Tulloch teaches IIS 4 in a clear manner and covers most of what I found to be on the exam. I also used ""SAMS TYS IIS 4 in 14 days"". SAMS is multi-authored and ranges from excellent to fair depending on who wrote the chapter. A good complementary book. IIS is very complex, read the on line Docs for indepth information. They are very good but overwhelming and will consume a SIGNIFICANT amount of paper if you try to print out just the basics."
2,You could memorize this book and still not pass the exam.,"This is the fourth Microsoft training kit I have used and by far the worst. It is very dry reading and doesn't seem to be organized in an effective way. My biggest complaint is that it contains several long chapters on material that is not even touched on the exam--Transaction Server, ASP, and Certificate Server. At the same time I had 10 - 15 exam questions on subjects that were not even mentioned in this book. (I did manage to pass the exam by two questions thanks to some lucky guessing!) The writing style in this book is also very dull making it a struggle to get through it without slipping into a coma."
1,There are better and cheaper ways to study for this test,"I found this book extremely ineffective as a study tool for this test. I passed the core MCSE exams by primarily studying the Microsoft text, and using the ""4 dummies"" books to fill in the minor details. However, I worked through this book page by page doing all of the labs, and found I knew little or nothing about administering IIS 4. This book also strays rather far from the material you can expect to see on the exam. I eventually passed strictly by studying the ""dummies guide"". You are better off passing on the Microsoft text, and if you want/need, you can put the $ you save toward other prep books on this subject."
1,Garbage,"It's so badly organized it's sometimes painful to read. The book is rampant with non sequiturs, and when it talks high-end technology it ends up as repetitive nonsense.I can't compare it to other study guides, but I know I'm not going to be able to carry much from this into the exam. I should have listened to the majority of these reviews. Look elsewhere."
1,abysmal,"By far the worst computer book I have ever read. Pompous. A lot of complicated paragraphs to explain very little about IIS. I have already passed MCSE and the IIS exam, and I know this book would have been of zero value. Don't waste your time or money."
3,barely enough information in book to pass test,"Decent book with good layout but only the bare minimum to pass the test. The book assumes your passing Enterprise and TCP/IP. Basically, I would not suggest this book but as the first book of many tools to pass test. Be ready with hands on experience. You will need it."
1,Not the book to use as a Study Guide,You can't get much worst than this. Very brief explainations on how stuff works and what it is. Mentions topics that it takes for granted that you already know about IIS4.0. This book should be taken off the market to prevent people from wasting their money.
4,great as always...,"like all the graphic novels i've read so far, this oh my goddess! is great -- it's not my favourite, hence the four stars, but it's still as clever and funny as ever."
5,"strange, but good","This volume begins with Belldandy falling ill. Keiichi wants to revive her using one of Urd's potions, but he doesn't know which one will works, so he tries them all himself - with strange results. Also, an old flame of Urd's comes by, and he's the extra jealous type. Then, Keiichi has to deal with a tough bike race, a girl wants to perform an exorcism at Keiichi's place, Megumi wants to defend her softball team's right to practice, and Keiichi has to deal with a dog. I seem to be reading a lot of sweet manga lately, but they're fun to read and can be a nice breathe of fresh air after dry nonfiction or depressing novels. The artwork in the Oh My Goddess series is, as usual, gorgeous, and I really enjoy the character interactions and humor. None of the main characters feel two-dimensional. I definitely recommend this volume."
4,Great for entertainment value only,"Warning! Do not buy this board if expect it to improve your standings in steel tip league play. Do buy it for family entertainment value, and to introduce the game to newbe's."
1,I LOVED this thing..while it worked.,This is a really great looking device. I was so much fun until the board started getting stuck. I returned it and the next one lasted only two weeks. I really want one of these boards as soon as this problem is fixed. Seriously!!! Make the changes and this will be a great product. All it needs really is a way to loosen the panels inside without having to take it down.
2,Such a disappointment,"I bought this dartboard hoping it would give me the flexibility to use both soft tips and steel tip, but found that I can't use either. The darts don't stay in like they are supposed to.The screws that held one of the doors in place has been stripped out and will not stay in place.The top half of the dartboard is intermittent in its scoring. When it doesn't score you can press the scoring pads, but sometimes that doesn't even work.It cost $60 to have this sent to me and it is going to cost another $60 to send it back. With the money spent in shipping alone I could have bought a descent board that actually worked.If you have a camcorder you can watch your shots as an instant replay so you can see what you hit. Then you can keep score the old fashioned way on a seperate piece of paper. I think that is the best way this dartboard can be enjoyed.Enjoy your purchase of another product. Do not buy this one."
1,Halex,I was totally disappointed with this dart board. The pictures look nice and pretty but the product is poor. I am using with the plastic tip darts and almost every dart is a bounce out. Don't waste your time or money.
2,Needs work,"I bought this dartboard and recieved it damaged. I had to fix the cabinet that it came in. Then lost the sound in the board witch i also fixed, the magnet fell out of the speaker i just had to glue it back in but for $200 plus you should just pug it in. Darts do not stick in board very often either. I would stay away from this product."
2,Halex 69805-MAP Cricket View 5000 Dartboard in Wood Cabinet,"Board worked well for about a month and then all the lights stopped working and the power kept shorting out. Also the board stopped obsorbing the darts. After only a month of use, the darts would hit the board and fall instantly. Do not purchase this item. Terrible product."
2,Voice commands/sound does not work,"I was disappointed because the audio system does not work. It is only static. We tried to contact the vendor and never heard back from them. This is a nice ""Manual"" dart board. We purchase a second, with the same internals set up but a diffrent cabniet. That one is fine. This one I let the kids use."
3,Came broken,The company shipped this in its original box. So when it came the box was beat up and one of the doors was broken. Now I have to deal with exchanging it. The box should halve been placed inside another box for protection. There are also not enough instructions on how to hang it or attach the dart board to the case. It was also missing screws.
4,"Good product for value, but what's with the elk head?","I bought one of these a year ago, and had a heck of a time with Halex service to replace it. A buddy suggested that we had clearly used it enough to pay for a new one, so I did. Haven't even plugged it in yet, but thought I'd let people know this one came with an elk head on the front panels, over the wood veneer. Actually looks cool, but not advertised as such.If this one lasts a year with the pounding I gave it, fine with me. When it's working, it's a killer app - pretty good play with automatic scoring."
4,Great little product,"I received these through a promotional offer and didn't think they would make a difference. I was wrong! These work great - very compact, comfortable and useful. I've had to sleep through some very loud situations, and these really help."
3,Shadows of Mercy,I found this book nice but in a juvenile way. It took two days two read this book. The plot was well constructed and it held my interest all the way through but I wish the book dealt with issues that are important. You'll love this book if you give it a chance and hopefully John can give us something more with his next book.-Jennifer
3,Interesting Reading,"This well written and informative book focuses in detail on the terrorist and military threats that the United States faces from people like Osama bin Laden. I thought the book was very good at discussing America's vulnerability to terrorism. What you do NOT get in this book is any kind of biography of Osama bin Laden himself or a sense of the goals and ""mindset"" of his oganization. This is essentially a technical terrorism book written for the layperson. For a book on the transnational Muslim fundamentalist movement itself which is causing so much heartbreak and devastation right now, I HEARTILY recommend Anthony J. Dennis's book ""The Rise of the Islamic Empire and the Threat to the West"" (also available through amazon.com) which eerily predicted and warned against the very events we are witnessing now. Both books are excellent and, together, make for complete reading of the issues in the headlines today."
5,A fantastic investigation into public enemy number one,The New Jackals is packed with information on Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network -- it's still more up-to-date than any of the news coverage I have seen since September 11. I'm just amazed the author has managed to collect all this information - I only hope the administration in Washington has read the book and talked to the author - he clearly has managed to talk to the top people in Pakistani intelligence and militants inside bin Laden's al Qaeda network. I can't recommend this highly enough - we all need to be aware of the growing danger posed by terrorists.
4,Already out of date,"The New Jackals has been superceded by events. It does, however, give a good background to the problems we are now facing....I HAVE read The New Jackals (when it was first released) and, whilst it was a valuable resource at the time, the information is now somewhat out of date."
3,Ramzi Yousef in focus,A decently researched book with ample detail and facts. A good introduction to the Al Qaida group and their geographical spread and strength. But if you are looking for a book with a focus on Osama Bin Laden then this is not the one. The focus of 'The New Jackals' is Ramzi Yousef - the first World Trade Center Bomber.I was a little disappointed because the information in the book was dated. I would recommend this as a light intro to where this new breed of terrorism is stemming from.
2,Not what I expected or wanted,"I have Sills (in her Julius Caesar, and in highlights from Semele in an anthology), and Sutherland in Alcina and in highlights from Julius Caesar. I love it all. Both voices, but particularly Sills', are rich and luscious. I was looking for more of the same when massive raves and praise induced me to buy this. It is done on period instruments, the soprano's voice though agile (though most of the songs are slow), is not rich. It is a simple ordinary soprano. The music on Piau's disc just sounds like typical Baroque music, I was particularly reminded of recorder music. Maybe Sills and Sutherland are exceptions, maybe Piau is how it's supposed to sound. But I did not enjoy, like it. When it comes to Baroque, my opinion remains unchanged. All I like (the Sills & Sutherland Handel notwithstanding) is Bach sonatas (nothing vocal, orchestral or on an organ, except Offering and the Brandenberg)."
5,Great!,This was definitly made for Leann not trisha. By the wy trisha is just a horrid singer! This song is great and sung by the right person. Congrads Leann!
5,tamara,i love this song i dont usally listen to country music but the first time i heard this song on one of my favorite shos days of our life i fell in love with it and have loved leann everysence she has a lovely strong voice and i wish her the best in upcoming songs i also plan to use this in my wedding
1,Do not buy this,"Garmin on longer supports the old BlueCharts, which means if you buy this, you cannot get the absolutely necessary 25 digit unlock code to actually use it. You must upgrade to the g2 software.Garmin Bluechart Pacific Saltwater Map CD-ROM (Windows)"
2,"Very Firm Support, But it SMELLS!","While I am extremely satisfied with the firm support and comfort of this pillow, the smell is so unpleasant that even after more than a month it has not dissipated, and I'm not sure if I can continue sleeping on it! It's something of a cross between new tires and medicinal. I have tried all manner of pillow barriers and protectors, yet the smell is so strong that it saturates three levels of coverings, and my skin and hair smell of chemicals when I awake."
2,Not as soft as I thought,The pillow is very nice but it doesn't really conform to you head. It sits a bit high which can cause slight neck pain. Although the pillow is cheaper here than in any store.
2,Not really a contour pillow,I have been trying to find a memory foam pillow to replace my old one but this one is not really what I expected. It is harder then memory foam and one side has rubber in it (coolcore) which I can feel. The other side is just plain cotton filling. It does not support my neck at all like a contour pillow would. For the price it was a waste. It now lives in the guest bedroom.
4,Perfect size,"I love these bowls! They are the perfect size for every day. The bowls that come with the place setting are simply too large, but useful for other things. I just wish they had more than one design for this size bowl."
4,Close to Perfection,"These are some of the most beautiful men I have ever seen. The potographer captures them so well. If you like guys, ckeck this awesome book out!"
3,Cheesy but fun!,"This was the first Betty Neels book I ever read and I rather enjoyed it. The plot revolves around a kind-hearted and lovely young nurse (Jane Fox) and her ""rescue"" by Dr. Nikolaas van der Vollenhove, a Dutch surgeon. After Ms. Fox's grandmother, to whom she has been devoted, dies, Dr. Van der Vollenhove saves Ms. Fox from penury and substandard jobs by proposing marriage. The characters were likable and the writing style pleasant. Dr. Van der Vollenhove seemed a bit cold and paternal rather than adoring of Jane Fox, but otherwise, it was a pleasant enough story. Not your typical hero and heroine carried away on waves of sentiment and/or passion, but there is true affection by the end of it all."
3,book,Book is ok. Just haven't gotten around to reading much of it. Lots of good stories in it about Southern Gospel music.
1,hymns for the family of god,"I ordered this item as a gift for someone who needed a spiral backed hymnbook with a hard back for use at the piano. I was sent a package of hole-punched pages with with no hardback and no spiral backing. They were just loose pages. It has been a month now and no explanation has been offered for the discrepancy between the Amazon description and the actual product by Amazon. I returned it, but I still do not have a hard bound spiral backed hymnbook."
5,Greatest collection of the greatest hymns,As a church music director and organist I can say that this is one of the best collections of standard and contemporary hymns. Great alternate last verse arrangements and descant lines allow this hymnal to stand out from others. The font is easily legible and the titles are logical and not just the first line of the song. A wonderfully organized table of contents round out the package. I highly recommend.
3,Serviceable but instructions would be appreciated,"I was able to install this product eventually, but potential customers should be aware that the seller provides no instructions whatsoever."
4,"Great foundation to ""start"" understanding Russia today","Clowe, West and Kassow gather a collection of 22 essays that address from every conceivable angle the subject of Russian civil society, and civic identity-- aka ""obshchestvo"" and ""obshchestvennost""-- all during the transitional period from imperial rule to the Russian Revolution. The volume looks through the lens of social history, work ethics, civic associations, professions, classes, and many more perspectives to create a definition of civil society (or ""middle class"" as Clowes, West and Kassow choose to identify it in the title.)For those of us attempting to make sense of what is occuring in Russia today, it is critical to take a long hard look at its past. And, that is just to start the road to understanding. I recommend this book to the hard-core Russophile or anyone wanting to build a historical literature review of Russia."
5,BLAKE & BRIAN ROCKS!,"I bought the cd just after it was released because I saw something in them. Blake Weldon has this knack for hitting those notes in an unbelievable way. There isn't a bad song on the entire cd, and I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to hear what real country is about. Curb needs to get B&B out there and push their music more so we can see more of them! Here's to future relases from B&B!"
3,Too Wobbly,"I bought this product because I could not find the one we used in a yoga class. Unfortunately, it feels like the rubber (plastic?) is too thin and plyable, making the foot bend at the toes rather than exercising the balancing talent of the ankle. When further inflated in an attempt to tighten the skin, it begins to shape like a ball and gets too rounded. I use it, but am looking for a replacement."
5,a sad but true novel...,"i like the realism, the truth about dictatorism, i just wanted to say that i am very sorry, sorry in the name of all the Moroccans, for what happened to this family and these kid.KIDS SHOULD NEVER BE PART OF A WAR AND POLITICS!!!!!!!Great novel Malika and thank you for sharing your story with usyou are all women's muse, you are our hero.i wish you all the happiness in the world and can't wait to read ""Freedom"""
2,Bluechart was not what I expected,"When ordering the BlueChart Americas I thought I was getting just that. A chart that covered all of the saltwater areas of North America. Unfortunately once opening it and going through the set up process I was only allowed to open up one small geographical area without paying additional fees to open other areas. I was lucky enough to have it cover the area I was intending to travel to immediatley, and will have to decide later if it will be worth it to pay additonal fees for the other areas I will be traveling in. I guess it pays to know the product you are ordering before you order it."
3,Great Product but Beware of Licensing Caveat (Licensing Stinks!),"Over all, no complaints about the product. It works as advertised. However, the licensing is not well advertised at all. You buy the whole CD titled Bluechart Americas, which contains the whole of Americas. However, only slivers of that can be activated with the license. For example, I live in the pacific northwest and that is the only regions I have access to. I cannot, without buying another license, use the charts for southern california or the gulf coast. I think that is bogus.So, buy it with both eyes wide open. If I had known, I still would have made the purchase but I just wouldn't be as ticked off."
1,Very misleading!,"CAREFUL - you don't get much coverage! It has been awhile since I have been so mislead by a product. Great charts, but what they don't tell you is that this CD is cut up into a bunch of sectors. YOU ONLY GET ONE sector and have to buy each additional sector - which for one that I checked was MORE than the original CD! I'd say RIP OFF if the charts were not so good. No...on second thought, I do feel like I've been ripped off!"
1,Crap Charts and no Support,"If you have a question or need support, forget it!!! I sent a email to Garmin support ""5 to 7 days"" for a reply. Ah, call them, 9 to 5 CST and a 90 minute wait.I love the GPS but needed help with charts and learned that Garmin does NOT SUPPROT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!If it takes a week or more to get help, I would say that the company has issues. I think that their hardware has some great engineering behind it but the company does not value its customers and does not support them beyond the sale.I'm not sure of the alternatives but I'm looking..."
1,Garmin Support is AWFUL,"Six weeks now and I still don't have this GPS running. Wait 45 minutes for tech support to get on phone, then they have to hand you off to someone else which means another 45 minute wait. Their instructions and web site are not intuitive and are very unclear. A friend who is a software designer can't figure this convoluted mess out. The best help is through others who have struggled with this and posted remarks and solutions on the internet. I would not recommend Bluechart Americas to anyone. This was supposed to help me navigate in my kayak, but it is giving me ulcers. This is a good stock (GRMN) to short. It just has to go down."
3,The Good and Bad,"The BlueChart Maps provide plenty of detail and are fairly simple to read on your device. The programs are also fairly simple to load on your PC, unlock and upload onto your Garmin device. There is one major flaw to this software...when you buy the CD you can only unlock one very small portion of the maps, if you want to unlock additional maps on your CD you need to purchase an unlock certificate for each region you wish to unlock. IMO if you buy the CD you should be able to access and use the ENTIRE CD. Just another way to rip off the consumer!"
3,Blue Chart Data for Newfoundland,"The Blue Chart Data on this CD for Newfoundland is considerably overpriced. I purchased the same data for Polynesia two years ago and was able to get chart data for the entire area we anticipated being in from the Marquesas to Western Polynesia--a fair amount for the money involved. This time, however, I was able to unlock on SW Newfoundland. I would have needed to unlock two-three more regions for the rest of Newfoundland and nothing in Labrador.Not sure why this region should be so expensive for so little. My second complaint with Garmin is that they still do not provide support for Apple computers--my platform of choice. Many promises, but no delivery."
4,Fine For Open Water,"Fantastic amount of detail for open water navigating. More limited for coastlines, such as creeks, small bays, any area involving adjacent land. easy to use and great support from Garmin."
2,Amazon shipped old version,"Amazon doesn't specify which version of BlueChart you will get. Amazon sent me version 9.0. I later found out that the current version is 9.5. Garmin now charges $75 to upgrade from 9.0 to 9.5. The charts are good, but Amazon should tell you which version you are getting."
5,Stick to this original version...,This is the version that everyone should be excited about. Franki Valli was a genius by introducing horns and trumpets in this delightful melody about a girl he cannot stop taking his eves off of.
4,FANTASTIC,"We bought this TV about 4 years ago as a grande finale when we found out we were having a baby. We had to replace the lamp about a year in and it was kind of a pain, but it was covered under warranty. It just sucked not having TV for a week or so.. But- we still have it. It's a great quality picture. I still walk through BB comparing, and only the SUPER expensive HD TVs compare."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Am am a electronics junkie who is well informed of the latest and greatest however this is not a 1080p TV like they say it is! Toshiba is lying to get stupid people like me to believe them. Thought is was a great deal to get a 1080p for about 2000 less than the bigger names. Should have listened to my instincts. 1080p DLP HDTV is the name of the ""engine"" used to make the pictures but has absolutely nothing to do with actual picture quality. It only will ACCEPT and DISPLAY 10801!!!!!! The quality is also horrible. At 480 or 720 resolution (both p and i) you cannot even see the faces of basketball players. 1080i is ok but you will have to stand 20+ (Manufacturers suggestion is 10-25) feet back to even get a decent picture. What is the point of a big screen if you have to be so far away. We replaced a pioneer HDTV from 3 years ago, no HDMI, 1080i is the best it can do, and it is by far better than this one. I REPEAT, DO NOT THIS PRODUCT IT IS NOT 1080p!"
3,Nice product but a bite expansive for its features,"This software enables you to create a visual database of your folders. Nice monitoring, easy previews, and quite user friendly.But the features are quite limited and I would have expect some more for the listed price.Good but expansive, that's why I rated this software with a 3"
4,Shopping around paid off,"I would not have thought the a simple plastic fracture pan would have been the answer but it has been.Without details, my husband has refused/been unable to take part in the process of his care. As a matter of fact, he is often resistant. So with that in mind, I knew I needed something that would slide under with a minimum of lifting on my part. This pan seems to do the job.I wish it held just a bit more easily because removing it and emptying it can be tricky. I guess I might need liners but since it is thoroughly cleaned after each use, I hate to spend the extra money."
4,Great poignant book.,This book has some great advice summed up in simple to remember axioms. I read a friends copy and bought a copy for myself for referencing.
4,Really Enjoyed Material -,"Especially erecting the Giant Wind Turbine, though I found host Sean Riley's constant hyping irritating after awhile."
3,A handy little guide to eating out in Budapest,"This is a handy little guide to eating out in Budapest. The reviews which I believe are taken from the newspaper, The Budapest Sun, are chatty and entertaining to read. The layout of the book is perhaps a little basic but I have found the title to be quite useful and have discovered a few really good restaurants within its pages, that I might not of tried had I not picked up this book."
3,Not So Much a Guide,"The campgrounds featured in this book are top notch and I applaud the author for choosing them. However, I don't like the way you have to read the author's little narrative story to extract all the info about each campground. I would prefer to see a list of activities for each campground and near by alternatives in case you can't get a reservation. I recommend that you supplement this book with a Moon Camping Guide so you get more specific info. Other than that it's a great book to have on hand if you're a camper."
4,one of the better in this series,I appreciate the more personal notes in the descriptions and discussion of surrounding areas. I have sometimes found other books in this series focus almost to a fault - the specifics of the campground with the exclusion of the surrounding environment which often plays into why I'm interested in staying at the campground anyway.
1,do NOT buy if you like to tent camp.,75% of the sites in this book allow RV camping. The title is extraordinarily misleading.
1,OMG This is not a cd worth buying,"I love American Idol as a TV show, but I think America found it's idols last year. These kids are great singers, but this cd is soooo boring. I would only buy this cd if I wanted to fall asleep. Sorry."
1,What happened to real music?,"I completely agree with amanita9's review and could not agree more. This is just proving that our nation is supporting greed for money and status. What ever happened to artists writing thier own music and having passion in what they sang? I hate seeing shows like this where they are ""manufactoring"" if you will, stars instead of letting them rise up on thier own. I have the most respect for the artists that sing thier own songs and have passion as well as talent."
5,better then the first one,ok now i review the AI1 but this one is better what more can i say just go out there in buy it cuz this cd will leave you speechlees cuz its 2 good
4,American Idol Fan Must Have.,"With the exception of Corey Clark (who still makes my ears bleed) this is a pretty good CD. I like the CD over all but have to say my fovorite performances are from Kimberly Locke, Clay, Ruben, and Josh. The others were good but no where in the league of these four.If you were a fan of the shoe this is a must have."
4,Good CD for American Idol 2 Fans,"This CD is filled with some amazing songs. Ruben Studdard's Superstar is amazing and so is Clay Aiken's On The Wings Of Love. Two that surprised me as being actually very good are Rickey Smith's Back at One and Kim Locke's Over The Rainbow. If there's one thing I have to say though, is that American Idol's (season one)CD is much better. Although I may be a little biased since I am a Kelly fan, I think that the songs are better and the talent is better for season one. I would recommend buying that instead."
4,Ameircan Idol...,I thought this cd was good my only complant would be that Ruben got a long song. . .my favourite was Clay and I think he should have got a longer song.1.What the world needs now final 11: 3/5 okay song kind of cheesy and boring.2.Superstar Ruben Studdard : 1/5 probably one of the worst songs on the cd..way too long and boring3.On the wings of love Clay Aiken: 5/5 most likely the best song on the cd Clay sounds amazing and he was my favourite since the begining4.At last Julia Demato: 4/5 great song just too short to actually get a feeling for the song.5. Three times a lady Josh Gracin: 3/5 says the chorus to much.6. Lets stay together Treynce : 2/5 BORING!7 8 9: all 2/5 NOT GOOD!!!10. How do I live Carmen Rasmusen: 4/5 one of her best songs11. Over the rainbow: 1/5 too low!12.Overjoyed: 3/5 fun at first gets anoynin13. God bless the USA 5/5 my favourite on the cd!
4,Awesome Cd,"Hey everyone. Well, this cd is amazing. for all of you that are clay, ruben, or k lo. fans, this is it. i can't wait for the solo albums... but, i'm sorry, carmen needs to get rid of whatever it is that she has--though i will credit this to be one of her better songs. enjoy y'all!"
4,"The American Idols (some of them, anyway) Go For The Gold!","I was surprised by the quality of this cd. I thought it might have been a bit ""cheesy"", but it is not. The highlights are: ""What the World Needs Now"", ""Over The Rainbow"", and ""On The Wings of Love"". While none of the vocalists ventures onto new ground, the overall sound and feel of the cd is pleasing nonetheless.The WORST: Reuben Studdard's rendition of ""Superstar"". If you like songs WAY oversung with simple words turned into 20 second excercises in ""special vocal stylings"", then Reuben is your man (e.g., ""radio-ye-yo-ye-yo-ya-ya"" and ""again-ya-yen-ya-yen""). This song is a complete misfire, with Reuben at the helm murdering its simple and passionate plea. Yuch! I can't BELIEVE he won the title, ""American Idol"".The BEST: Clay Aiken has much respect for the original recording of ""On The Wings of Love"", yet makes it his own with refreshing subtlelty. He makes it sound effortless."
4,Sounds good,I really enjoyed this CD.They picked good songs to sing and the vocals were good.God Bless The USA was really good at the end!
3,Kimberly Locke is the best thing about this cd...,"As much as I like watching American Idol, most of the songs on this cd are worth skipping. Clay and Ruben both add considerable polish and quality to this disc (as they are known for), but Kimberly Locke's 'OVER THE RAINBOW"" is, for me, the true standout on this cd. I believe Randy Jackson called her rendition of this all-time classic number ""A master class in singing."" He couldn't be more right on! ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" has been heard so many times over the years by so many different artists, but Kimberly adds new magic to it. ""OVER THE RAINBOW"" fits Kim's jazz-colored voice like a glove. I certainly hope to hear more from her in the future. As great as Ruben and Clay are, Kim is a very high quality vocalist as well. Another singer to check out on this cd is Trenyce. I guess one could say that she adds some modern r&b diva flavor to this compilation. On the whole, AMERICAN IDOL SEASON 2: ALL TIME CLASSIC AMERICAN LOVE SONGS is passable."
4,Reuben is the Man,"Reuben Studdard is the one and only American Idol, not Clay Aiken, so all ""Reuben Haters"" should just accept it and move on. Reuben sounds great on the CD, but Clay as usual gets more hype than he deserves(he sounds more like a broadway singer than an American Idol-which is why he lost). Go Reuben! 205!"
4,Not Enough Clay Songs,I guess what Im really waiting for is a CD filled with the full version of every song Clay sang during the competition. This CD will do till then I suppose. It's a nice sampling of the top 11 performers- who we all came to know over the months. It gives their voices a different twist when you listen without seeing them. I like it. Cant wait for Kimberly L's CD either.
3,thankful,"its okay, but kelly clarkson' thankful is the best, music for everyone. she can sing and the songs are great"
3,Gracin-not a good singer,Why does being a marine make Josh Gracin an idol? He can't sing. He is definitely the worst one on the show. Reuben and Clay definitely have the best voices-which this cd reveals and one of them should win.
1,No stars if I could!,"This is absolutely the worst excuse for music I have heard in my entire life. If I went to a kareoke bar, I would hear better singing than this. That is basically all this is. It isn't like any of these poor kids wrote any of their own songs or are singing these songs from the heart. It is all driven by the desire for money, power, and status. That is why this album makes me sick and what is wrong with America today. Shameful!"
3,american idol review,"Ive only heard some of the songs on this cd. I don't know what happened to Julia on the show, but her song (besides clay) was great. If she had of sang like that on the show she would have went alot further."
5,Good album!,"I particularly liked Clay Aiken's powerful ""On The Wings of Love"" (though I've heard more impressive versions from Asian Songbird Regine Velasquez and international balladeer Martin Nievera for this particular song) and the ensemble song ""God Bless The USA"" (great harmony, very heartfelt rendition).The previous comment is hilarious, but yes, it's a relief that there's no squeaking on this album. LOL."
4,"I'm a Big Fan of the show, and I will cherish this CD","I don't understand all the previous negative reviews. I'm am extremely pleased with the CD. Rueben was hauntingly beautiful. Julie with ""At Last"" was surprisingly good. I thought all the performances were relaxing and pleasant. I like falling asleep to the music at bedtime. I give it a 4, because I usually skip over the first song (what the world needs now--group performance), and I'm not fond of the song, ""Over The Rainbow"" (even though I love the singer, Kimberley Locke)."
3,"It's decent, but there's a big hole in the recording","So far, I haven't checked out the whole recordingyet, but I've listened to a lot of it. What's good on the disc is that most of the songs are well done, except the flattish backing tracks. However, what's missing from this album stopped me from picking it up right away at the store. That would be Vanessa Olivarez. Skipping her on this album is a mistake. If this is supposed to be a compilation of the finalists' best work, they really need to include all of them. Thankfully, though, she was back on the show for the finale and will probably be on tour with the other 9 that will be there. Gracin and Clark weren't present, so I'm assuming they won't be on tour.Still, after hearing a friend's copy, I may get this because it is well done. But I'm still not happy they skipped my personal favorite, Vanessa."
4,Preparation for the Tour - Live v CD,"Generally a good CD for an Idol fan - probably less so if you came to it without knowing the Characters.Some song choices were not good - Clay's was a cheezy song - but as always he can make even a dog of a song GREAT! 5/5Good Rendition - but Kimberley L needs to let go of the Rainbow -enough already! 3/5What a surprise Kimberley Caldwell, Julia, Carmen and Charles can sing when given studio production and good song choices 4/5As to the rest - ho-hum - what was Ruben thinking? 3/5Josh was OK but ordinary 3/5Rickey copied every phrasing and breath - this is not supposed to be an impersonation of the original 1/5Everyone who can will just hit skip as soon as Corey starts 0/5Worth having the CD tho and good preparation for the tour to see how much magic happens in the studio - hope that Corey is not on the tour!"
4,A must have for AI2 fans,"It's fun to hear these talented young people through the benefit of studio production and a good stereo system. Most people up to now have only been able to listen over the TV or computer, so this is a real treat. Clay Aiken's voice in ""On the Wings of Love"" soars to the heavens and he nails this one to the wall. Kim Caldwell also comes through very impressively with ""Killing Me Softly"" and it's good to hear Rickey Smith's wonderful vocals with ""Back at One."" And the group versions of ""God Bless the U.S.A."" and ""What the World Needs Now Is Love"" are really lovely."
5,American Idol Season 2,"My favorite American Idol was Kimberly Caldwell. Then Ruben but he was in the bottom 2 last week!?Anyway, I think this cd is great. The only problem is that Vanessa and Charles aren't on it but Corey is. Great songs! Great music! Buy this cd before it runs out ..."
4,hmmmmmmm,1. God Bless the USA - 5/52. What The World Needs Now - 4/53. Superstar - Ruben Studdard - 5/54. On The Wings of Love - Clay Aiken - 5/55. At Last - Julia DeMato - 5/56. Three Times A Lady - Joshua Gracin - 4/57. Let's Stay Together - Trenyce - 4/58. Back at One - Rickey Smith -3/59. Killing Me Softly With His Song - Kimberly Caldwell - 3/510. Open Arms - Corey Clark - 2/511. How Do I Live - Carmen Rasmusen - 1/512. Over The Rainbow - Kimberley Locke - 5/513. Overjoyed - 4/5
4,gets better,ok songs but the voices make up for it good just go buy this ull like it theres nothing much 2 say
5,Best CD ever,this is a awesome cd.My Favorite songs are on the wings of love (clay aiken)3 times a lady (josh Gracin)Back at one (rickey smith)and some where over the rainbow(kimberley Locke)if you a AI2 fan you will love it
1,All Time Classic Love Songs...Ruined,"Seriously, this CD is BAD. The only song that I can say is any good is Ruben Studdard's rendition of Superstar. And if you like that song, go buy Ruben's album, because this is not worth your money. The only reason I can see anyone buying this album, is if you are just into collecting AI merch. Other than than, SKIP THIS ONE."
2,...,"this album really [is unacceptable]. if youre planning on gettin this cd, save your money. i only listen to trenyce, julia, kimberly, and charles on this cd.1. Superstar (Ruben Studdard)- his voice was good, but the song is kind of boring.2. On The Wings Of Love (Clay Aiken)- horrible! i was a fan of clay's in the beginning, but hearing him on this song makes me wanna say thank the lord ruben's the american idol.3. At Last (Julia DeMato)- i love this song! amd julia sings it pretty well.4. three times a lady (josh gracin) - this song [is unacceptable]!5. let's stay together (trenyce) - love it!6. back at one (ricky smith) - love the song.7. killing me softly (kimberly caldwell) - love the song8. open arms (corey clark) - boo!9. how do i live (carmen) - she ruins the classic!!!10. over the rainbow (kimberly Locke)- does she not know any other song then this?11. overjoyed (charles grigsby)- i love it!i'm not trying to be simon or anything but this cd really reeks."
2,Where's Vanessa Olivarez?,Where's Vanessa Olivarez?...how cheesy not to have included her. Top 11? Makes no sense.
5,One of the Best This Year,"This CD doesn't have a weak track on it. The selection of songs was great and the artists rendered some of their best performances. Clay's and Ruben's performances were strong, but Julia DeMato's rendition of ""At Last"" really blew me away. I hope we hear more from her in the future. Kimberly Caldwell gave one of the best renditions of ""Killing Me Softly with His Song"" that I have ever heard. Trenyce and Kimberley Locke were also exceptional. I look forward to hearing them live this summer."
4,Review,I thought the only good songs were On the Wings of Love by Clay Aiken and What The World needs now is Love. Clay Aiken Rocks!
1,It seems to me that there is no creativity in this...,"sure these people can sing, but there is no creativity, these are all other peoples songs! I believe the real talent is in writing and performing music. Like the Beatles or Dave Matthews Band... and it would be better if they were origional songs, not just covers of famous songs. That's what really gets me, is that they are covers. Rather uninspired to me. And having God Bless The USA on this is just a marketing ploy because Americanism is hip in America. Too bad all the radio stations play the same songs over and over again in the US. I guess I just wish that the next American Idol has not cover songs but origional songs."
3,Zena,Most of the CD is pretty good the group songs sound good but some of the solos needed some fine tuning.The Big Stud is great as usualClay gives me goose bumpsK-Lo is wonderfulJulia is so soulfulTrenyce was just ok what a disappointmentJosh was goodRicky was goodCarmen was OKCory was OKKimberly Caldwell left something to be desired I skip this song.But I miss Vanessa
4,American Idol,This CD is even better than the first one!I could believe how good it was. You should definetly buy it.My Opinion on the Songs by the finalistsRuben Studdard: Great version of the song 5/5Clay Aiken: Another great version of the song 5/5Julia Demato: Good rendition I could not believe it was her 4/5Joshua Gracin: Perfect Song!I love it without the country thang! 5/5Trenyce: Bland Version of the song sounds a whole lot better on tv. 3/5Rickey Smith: Not as good as I thought it would be. 3/5Kimberly Caldwell: Great song for her! 5/5Corey Clark: Not good! Sounds like a girl in the song! 2/5Carmen Rasmusen: Horrible! Sounds like a goat who has a cold 1/5Kimberley Locke: Sounds alot better on tv. 3/5Charles Grigsby: Sounds Great on this song! 5/5
4,Love Songs,"I borrowed this CD from the library, because I love romantic music and thought the collection was nice. Some songs were better than others. My favorite was Clay Aiken's ""On the Wings of Love."" He sang it exactly like the original singer. I do, however, feel that Judy Garland is the only person who could sing ""Over the Rainbow"" and I can't tolerate ""At last,"" but I guess it was sung well. They all were."
3,Ok but not great,I watched every episode of AI2 (but will never watch it again). I found the majority of the singers to be better live so didn't really care for the CD much. I loved Clay Aiken's On the Wings of Love (which was the only reason I bought the CD) but was very impressed with Julia Demato's track as well. Ruben's Studdard's track was a total yawn from start to finish and Corey Clark's version of Open Arms should never have been released. The rest was pretty middle-of-the-road.
3,Buy it for the top 3 singers,"Kimberley is good. Ruben is good. Clay is amazing. The two group songs are great as well. Other than those five amazing songs, don't expect much. Give five stars to those songs and not so much to the others(Ricky's is the best out of the rest.)"
1,Not like the salon version at all.,"When I received the product, the packaging was different - something about an ""elastashield"", and when I used the product, I noticed it was much more watered down than the one I buy in the salon, or even the one they sell at Target (both the shampoo and conditioner were the same). My hair didn't feel nourished at all - it was dry and frizzy, and limp within a day. I was very disappointed - this has been my favorite shampoo/conditioner brand for years now. I won't be buying Redken online anymore."
1,Redken must have changed the formula,"I have purchased Fresh Curls shampoo and conditioner for years. My most recent purchase (not from Amazon) fits the description of the two other reviews at this site: much watered down, doesn't provide any body, and leaves my hair feeling like straw. The color of the packaging is slightly lighter hue. I'm convinced Redken changed the formula, left the name the same, didn't add text saying ""new/improved"" etc, and left the consumer disappointed. This isn't our former Fresh Curls conditioner."
2,Jules and Jim,"In the beginning this book seems as if it will be interesting, or scandalous, or something, but it quickly proves to be an endless series of repetititive vignettes about the two title characters and their innumerable attempts to find love, or passion, or a reason to live, or something. The second half of the book is centered mainly on Jim's long affair with Kate, Jules' wife. Jules completely approves of and even facilitates their relationship, so there's really no conflict there. The conflict comes from their innumerable break ups and reconciliations. When I say innumerable, I mean it. After a point I found myself not really caring whether they stayed together or not, but just praying for the relationship to be resolved one way or another so that the descriptions of their silly, melodramatic fights would end. The book is kind of interesting in terms of its style and its commentary on social and moral values in early 20th century Europe, but overall I found it a bit of a bore."
3,Accurate storyline,"Three of Chandler's short stories told in comic book style are fairly accurate to the originals. The first, ""Goldfish"", has mediocre graphics --and I'm being kind! The art is sometimes so poor that it becomes confusing as to what character is speaking. But the second two stories have excellent illustration that graphically enhances the storyline. These two,""Trouble Is My Business"" & ""The Pencil"", make the book worth reading and provide an interesting adaptation. Any story in print, however, is the best way to appreciate Chandler and neither film noir nor comics can surpass the experience he provides on the printed page."
2,Meh.,"These games are tried and true, but kind of boring and redundant. They are mostly focused on fun for the riders and not so much fun for the horses. If you want something unique and different, get The Pony Games Book. It has original games whereas this book has a lot of games like Red Light, Green Light and Around the World, which almost everyone has played. The Pony Games Book is a more useful learning tool."
2,Very Basic,"This is a very basic book, could be great for an instructor of kids or a 4H group. Not what an adult rider would want."
5,Seduction of The Heart - Tim Lehaye,Excellent for every CHRISTIAN to read and apply to your life.This book makes us aware of subtle ways Satan deceives each and every one. God has a way of teaching us through His Divine Word-Through His Son and The Holy Spirit - through Pastors- Song -and - yes - through this material written by Tim Lehaye. If it is offensive - then it must be convicting. We must be made awareof Satan's lies and how he lures us and our families into hisweb that will eventually ensnare. I do not agree with the otherreview written that this is depressing-negative -- If it is takenin the context intended - it will open your eyes to the ways of the Father of lies and this world. Christian- we are not OF this world - but IN this world. To be a better Christian and do theKingdom Work God has called us to do- then we best steer clear and not patronize the cable companies and the ads and all thatdraws us away from God.
3,2 and 1/2 stars really..,This is a concequences of sin vien book. The opening testamonies are kinda long but the comentarial scriptures are strong/sound.
4,"Comfortable, well-built shoe for a nice price","This is a very comfortable shoe, at a great price. I have not yet worn them for a full day (as a teacher, I'm on my feet all day)but they feel very good on my feet, and seem to have adequate support and cushioning. I'd love to see a gel insert or other extra cushioning, but for the price I can put in a pair of inserts. There is a cushion at the heel to prevent the shoe rubbing against the ankle; this is a nice touch and something I considered crucial when shopping for a shoe."
3,Tender Tails Lady Bug by Precious Moments,So cute but got a single star in durability and 3 star overall rating (both antenna were missing - was this a second?). This one also has it's nose as a separate plastic piece (not sewn on) and may be chewed off or pulled off by smaller children causing a choking hazzard. Never leave child unsupervised with this toy.
2,Good Overview but somewhat lightweight,"This book is primarly geared toward the VB folks. He addresses the C API but barely touches the COM C++ interface. Specifically, questions which are not resolved are 1.) Do I have to use smart pointers when I do not want to? 2.) How do you handle MSMQ Events with the C++? The examples given in VB do not extend to C++ and there is no clear way to go from registering MSMQEvent to the _DMSMQEventEvents implementation. I had to resort to the C API."
3,For future programmers of applications that use MSMQ,"I like to see published a book about MSMQ. This is a book mainly for programmers of MSMQ applications, the guys who actually build the application and already know Microsoft programming & environment very well (not for architects of MSMQ applications). With this book you will learn about a sophisticated product and this book is not for beginners. Maybe it goes to fast to details and it is difficult to grasp the whole picture. I personally liked most the analisis of Object Shipping, Transaction Processing and MSMQ Performance. If you want a book about messaging & queuing use cases try ""Distributed Computing with IBM MQSeries"", and if you want a book about messaging & queuing arquitecture and theory try ""Messaging & Queuing Using the MQI""."
4,very good,"The book is awesome, it is like a sermon because it gives you quotes of the Bible all around, it also gives you a very good idea of the world in which Ezekiel lived, and links his life with that of Jeremiah. At first I though it wasn't going to be that good because I saw more expensive books, but the lowness of the price is not at all indicative of its very fine quality."
2,minor league,"The writer's okay with that kind of brisk prose that glides along but in the end I wondered if he ever really had a story in mind or if he just stared at that photo that graces the book jacket and imagined it all out. I mean, sure, that's a valid starting point for a novel but I got bored after awhile and wanted a plot. Something to twist the narrative in a direction I wasn't expecting. I mean, sure, Nixon was sweating My Lai at the time but then that's such an obvious choice for an author. A better writer would have skipped past that and dove deeper into Nixon's myriad of complexities and not played him off as a simple fool surrouded by unthinking gobots."
4,Poor Carol Neulander!,"This crime was shocking because it involved a beloved mother and figure of a Jewish community in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. She was brutally murdered in her home by two men. The shocking twists was that it was her husband, the beloved Rabbi Neulander, who orchestrated the murder in order to avoid a divorce. The Rabbi is no saint because he was having an extramarital affair with one of his congregants, a prominent radio talk show hostess. The Neulander tragedy is sad because we don't expect this to happen so close to home. Poor Carol Neulander! all she wanted was a family and ran a successful business as well. Her murder was particularly heinous and just evil because it was just so brutal. How can a husband especially a Rabbi or even a minister do such a heinous act? He robbed his children of their mother and a community of a beloved figure. Rest in peace, Carol."
2,Very disapointing,This book was very boring I had to skip thru a lot of it.All the author talks about is the trail and does not do any research on the backgrounds of the people involved.This book was a big dissapointment. I would not recommend it to any true crime fans.
2,dated and basic,This is not what I expected. More about running meetings than anything else.The section on how to use overhead projectors should have been a clue to the lack of updates.There are a few good random speaking tips from experts at the end.
3,Cool Toy,"This is a cool toy. I brought it to a New Years party and it was an attention getter, people got a kick out of it."
1,worst toy ever,"sure the robosapien was a hit,but the robosapien v2 is just a piece of crap,you need to have it on a special kind of floor to make it walkit cant sit down or get up right,dont buy i bet they hired people to make it look good,and bowling? do i really need to go into this? his hand precison is the same as the first one as he only tries to pick toys up from two differnt modes of pickup for each hand,DO NOT BUY,get a aibo instead as altough they are alot of money atleast they do not cause this much trouble (inless you get a defect one,no machine is perfect)"
5,WOWWW,I got for christmas. I wanted it so much. I love his dance. (he is doing the robot) Cool color identefication and your hand. just Very cool
2,Total Disappointment,"I would Seriously not Recommend to Buy this Robot as Mine Malfunctionedwithin A Day when I tried different Commands from the Remote, & Customer Service was very Horrible as till date they did not get back to me & itcost me a Bomb & its like a Crash Dummy sitting in a Corner of my Living Room.Pls be Careful when you Purchase any Stuff from Needful Things as there is No Gurantee for your Money!!!"
4,Robosapien,"I bought this for my six year old grandson. It is a little sophisticated for him, but I thought he could grow into it. He loved it. Unfortunately, there were a couple quality control problems with it, so I had to return it. Maybe in a couple years, they will have a more durable product. I will definitely consider it when my grandson is eight. He loves robots and is being raised to be a computer geek.Overall, I would recommend it."
5,great gift !,"This was a christmnas present for my son age 9. He played with this so much, we went through a set of batteries in 2 days. This is great gift for any child (and adult). Too bad it does not come with a bunch of batteries. My hats off to the inventor and to Amazon for getting this delivered to my door on time. It made christmas worth while to see the look on my son's face when he opened it."
5,robosapien,"This was purchased for a 6 year old for his birthday I was hesitant at first thinking it might be to advanced, but with a little help he is doing fine with it It is one of his favorite toys It is well made and educational I do suggest rechargeable batteries"
3,Novelty fades fast...,"It was cool for about a week or two, now he mostly sits dormant in the corner taking up an unfortunately large and conspicuous area. Still generates interest from visitors for whom we turn it on and let it dance about for a minute or two before returning it to its corner.On our tile floors the walking gait is a bit out-of-control at times. He seems to be a tad spastic in his gait which causes him to gradually build swaying momentum from side-to-side that eventually causes him to topple on his face; which, considering we paid quite a bit for him, does make me cringe a bit. So I keep a close eye on him and make sure to put the brakes on if I see him start the swaying.In the end, I like gadgets; and he's definitely a cool gadget. If you're contemplating gettin one I'd think hard about waiting for version 3.0."
4,Not Bad,Bought this robot for my nine year old for xmas. He says it is the best gift he has. I will recomended this present for any kid that has time to read the instructions. It takes some time to practice and use all the functions. You must read to obtain full advantage of this product. This is not a real robot but a toy with some advance tech stuff ment for children.
4,Perfect!,I couldn't find a case for my phone ANYWHERE sooo of course I had to search Amazon for a few that suit my girly personality. I found a ton! The one that seemed to fit me perfectly was the one above and when I received it (about 4 days later) it fit my phone perfectly! They have oppenings for every speaker and the volume control and it comes with a handy belt clip (that can be used to sit your phone up). The only thing that I would change would be to cover up the volume control since I don't use it anyway..lol!
2,Very Loud Fan,"I had a similar fan by Duracraft that I used for years, and I loved it. I was hoping that this fan would be a good replacement, and it isn't.This fan was purchased for use in my bedroom.Pros: Dual control fans; hardware available for mouting vertical as well as using it horizontally. Affordable.Cons: Pulling out the side extensions is tricky work, but manageable. The ""low"" setting is more like a medium, and thus it is pretty loud. Having both fans on the low setting makes the side extensions rattle because the fan is working so hard.I would not purchase this fan again. I would have returned it if I had not thrown the box away."
1,Faulty fan,I purchased this fan in June 2008. One year later one of the twin fans has stopped working altogether. I do not recommend this Honeywell Enviracaire Fan. Not nearly as good as my Holmes Accutemp fan.
4,Exceeded our needs.,"The fan works very well. In the product description, I misinterpreted the side screens on the sides of the unit to mean a screen in the unit. This fan only has slats to direct air flow. There is no screen to filter out bugs, but that's my problem.The unit reverses flow amazingly and doing so doesn't appear to phase the fan at all, even on the highest settings. I suspect that it would be perfect for instances when you just need to vent quickly.If you did your research, you'll probably end up purchasing this product."
1,Broke down after 4 months,"It did work very well for 4 months before one of the fans started spinning much slower than the other. It is very weak now. I use the fan all the time but that is no excuse for it to fail after a few months. The plastic they use for the body of this is the inexpensive kind as well, which is how they keep the price down I would imagine. I have also bought Honeywell fans before and the motors do give out with regularity. I have since bought a Bionaire."
1,Great...till it died.,"I had a much older window fan that was working well, but I liked the advantage of this model's duel controls. I loved this fan! It was quieter and easy to switch to exhaust. I am really sad though, that it lasted less than a season. I turned it on one night and, poof!, big flash of light and then nothing. My old one control, two-speed fan is back in the window for this season until I can find a good long-lasting one."
3,A lot of wind comes with a lot of noise!,"Whoever said in their review that is fan was ""whisper quiet"" must be sleeping with ear plugs. It is loud! Yes, it does produce a nice breeze, but I set only one of the two fans on low and you'd think you are in a room with an airplane. If you want loud white noise and are willing to give up the sounds of nature outside - this for you."
4,happy with purchase,I have bought two of these fans and I'm in agreement with the reviews so far on the performance of them. When you set them to high they are a bit noisy but at low setting they are pretty quiet. I would recommend this fan especially for this price.
4,great fan,"nice fan - fits in lower sash of window - would be ever nicer if it would fit in top of window - I purchased four (4) fans, and had to make supports for them fit in top of windows for true exhauts effort - they work very well, I'm pleased with the fans"
1,Beware- Not as described,"Bought this fan to put in my sliding window, but found that it takes a permanent installation of a bracket and screws. Side wings will not stay open with any pressure on them, even when locked. This fan is going back. Did not bother to plug in, so I don't know about noise level or if it was defective in other ways."
1,Junk,"This fan is junk. I received it on 5/26 and on 5/31 it quit working. Didn't even make it a full week. I'm sure Amazon will take care of it, but I'm done with Honeywell."
3,Noisy,"I expected the fan to be virtually silent at slowest speed, but that is not the case. I could distinctly hear it from 15 feet away. Thermostat works as expected."
2,One MAJOR design flaw,"This fan is a very good product in every way EXCEPT for one - but that one flaw is a MAJOR flaw. I really like all the speeds and the fact that you can adjust it to blow in or out, however, the locks on the side panels are on the wrong side. If you're trying to adjust it to fit into your window how are you supposed to reach the other side in order to lock the panels in place? And if you turn it around then all your controls for the fans are on the wrong side. This fan is powerful and versatile, but it takes so long to try to get it in place that I just end up aggravated by the time I finally have it in. And keep in mind that that's with one of four locks unlocked when it should be locked because there's no way to lock them all. Had I realized the locks for the side panels were on the wrong side I would not have spent $50 on this fan - the design is just dumb."
1,Doesnot put out the volume of air cool I was wanting for our small office space,"I needed more cool aire functionability,,thought since our ac had gone out in our small office this would help until an new or repair had been completed. No.Not really.I was not impressed. but its cooling capacity..."
3,window fan,"This fan is o.k., but I guess I expected more with the way the ad and description talked about it."
2,Noise Noise NOISE,This fan is VERY NOISY!Low speed is like the highest speed on other fans. The middle and highest speeds are like listening to a twin turboprop jet ready to take off.Even at the high speeds it doesn't move a lot of air. The circular duct around the fan is too short to be effective as there is more air space around the perimeter of the fan blades than the blades themselves.The retractable side panels are attached to overly strong springs. It takes 2 locks to hold them in place and they would be much easier to use if they were on the inside of the house rather than facing the outside.I first bought a similar $19 no-name twin window fan at our local Menards (regional box home store like Lowes or Home Depot). That cheap fan was too loud but as it turns out it was quieter than this highly rated Honeywell. Others I looked at are all made in China (the Honeywell too) and all have the same cheap plastic construction. I don't expect any will be quiet.R
2,I hate this window fan,"I hate this window fan. It is loud on anything other than the lowest setting. It is also impossible to clean. You can pry the two front grills off, but good luck trying to wipe down the blades."
1,poorer quality control than Duracraft model it replaced,"I bought these Honeywell window fans because photos indicate that they're identical to a pair of Duracrafts that served me well for many years, and which I can't find available new.Well, the HW-628s aren't as good. I might just have gotten unlucky, but the two I ordered both have left side fans that rattle slightly but bothersomely during operation. Not enough to persuade a busy person to stick them back in the boxes and send them back to Amazon, but still -- it's annoying, and the fact that the same problem occurred in both fans I received suggests that other prospective buyers might want to be careful before ordering.No complaints about delivery or packaging. My problem is with the product."
1,Broken after few months of use.,"I brought one from Amazon and hardly use it. One day I turned it on, heard some 'zipping' noise and saw electric spark on the left fan monitor. Now the fan is working only with the right fan monitor (until I decide what to replace it with). I check the warranty and decided it's not worth the trouble - just a few more dollars, I can buy a new one. The question is, do I want a another Honeywell?"
4,Reliable Fan,I bought this fan for my son's room. I needed one that stretched out more than most other ones I looked at. I have been very pleased with my purchase so far.
4,"Works great for the money, but has some caveats",The Honeywell window fan works pretty well. It's pretty self explanatory. It's able to blow the hot air out of your room as well bring in cold air. The temperature control doesn't work too well. It would be nice if he corresponded to some numbers.The fan didn't fit very well into my window. I had to use some duct tape and cardboard to keep in in place. I have a side sliding window.
2,Got a lemon,"We bought this fan because of the mostly good reviews that it got on amazon. Sure enough it worked fined for about a week then the right fan blew out. Just stopped working for no reason whatsoever.When it DID work, it worked ok. It did what it was supposed to do. Unfortunately that did not last. In the process of trying to return it."
3,Good Fan But Not Quiet,"I bought this same fan many years ago. It was very quiet but not much power. This new fan I just purchased has a lot more power of airflow but is very loud for me, even on low. I do like the features this fan has to offer. Thermostat controls, reverse exhaust, and directional airflow. It also comes with a mounting bracket in case you need to mount it sideways in your window. The older model came with little detachable feet to stand it up by itself but not this one..too bad. I'm keeping it. Really cools off my room."
4,Works well; a bit noisy; strange design,"This fan works quite well, blowing fresh air in, out or both at once. Controls and function are well designed and the fans are very efficient for their small size.Drawbacks: Doesn't fit the window snugly nor does it have any kind of screening. This allows bugs in around and through the fan (unless its blowing outward). Also, the latches which hold the expanding sections in place are on the OUTSIDE of the unit. This makes it very awkward to install and remove because one must reach over the fan while holding the expansion section in place (which springs back into the fan body if released) while sliding the locks on the outside of the unit to lock the expansion units in place. It's a poor design in my opinion.Finally, it's noisy. Not terribly noisy but it sounds like a couple of small model airplane motors when running on high.However, it does the job well when you want to ventilate a room."
3,"Reliable, underpowere---but removable grills are great feature","It's best feature: the REMOVABLE GRILL PANELS. Ever try cleaning a window fan without them---just pull the fans off, rinse off in the sink with a little cleaning spray, and back in the fan for another go.It's reliable enough. I've had this fan in my living room window going 24/7 for 3 years, and still going strong.BAD: It's underpowered. IT will not remove enough air for a large room. I bought the fan because I smoke cigars and want a strong exhaust fan. This one is just underpowered for the purpose of exhausting cigar smoke..."
1,Problems with side panels,I bought two of these fans in June 2009 and in less than a year the side vents (made from plastic) were both split with large holes in each. The vents are meant to expand to fill any extra space on either side of the fan but with gaping holes in them they are useless. Thank God for duct tape. Buy a role if you buy this fan--you're going to need it.
3,Seems alright,"The product is quite good except what bothers me the most is its operational noise. I don't think that at high sppeds, the noise is low enough to help one concentrate on reading assuming the fan is fitted to the window right next to the reading table."
3,Problems,"I bought one of these fans at my local Target store about 6 months ago and it works great! That is the only reason I am giving this fan a 3 star rating.Since the fan worked so great I thought I'd order 1 from Amazon since my local Target was sold out of them.After about 2 weeks the right fan quit working. Amazon, having the awesome customer service that they have had no problem returning it for an exchange.Well, here I am now about 38 days since the exchange and the right fan has quit working on this one too. Unfortunately Amazon has a 30 day exchange policy so it looks like I am just screwed on this one. I guess I will try contacting the manufacturer for repairs."
4,Honeywell HW-628 Twin Window Fan,"I've used this fan for a number of years and the originals are starting to fail. I searched high and wide for replacements and found them only on Amazon. The fans are relatively quite, have reveraile motors (inflow and exhaust). They have a thermostat, which quite frankly, I never bother to use. The biggest selling point for this fan over others I've seen is the movable grills. By rotating the fan grills, you can direct airflow to where you want it. It's necessary to have this feature given the window/furniture placement in my rooms. They fans seem fairly durable. I've owned the originals for a long, long time and run them all day on hot summer days (exhaust during the day, fresh air in during the night)."
1,1/2 Capacity less the 2 months,"I have had this fan for less 2 months and one of the fans no longer works. Also a jet engine would have less noise then when both fans are on high. I would, if is was possible, mark this review with a negative rating."
4,Efficient air mover,"The fan does precisely what it is designed to do, move outside air through a window inside; or, reversing the process , drawing the air in a room through a window outside. The controls allow you to use the fans blowing together or with one working opposite the other, exchanging stuffy air inside with fresh air from outside.Some may find the fans a bit noisy, especially if used at night near your bed. Others will find the ""white noise"" effective at masking the sounds of traffic, etc. The accordion type extensions at either end of the casing only pull out a foot or so, making the maximum usable width only about 36""."
2,Deficiencies in quality and design,"My unit also rattles, because the plastic parts consisting of the blades and the cones to which they are attached are somewhat warped and therefore out of balance.The blades of an exhaust fan should be in a circular opening with only a small gap between the blades and the edge of the opening, to prevent back flow. The blades of these fans are mounted an inch in front of their circular openings, not inside them, so some of the air they blow out gets into the blades from the sides, not from the room. This design wastes electricity and requires a noisier speed to exhaust a given amount of air.I use this unit to ventillate my basement. I would not want to have it where I would hear it.I should say though, the fan costs less than it would cost just to mail it back to China, so I should not complain. The instruction book even lets you know that Honeywell merely sold its name to the actual manufacturer."
3,No Pull,Was disappointed in the exhaust. The main reason I purchased the fan was to draw the smoke from my bedroom. I only smoke in my bedroom to save the rest of the house. It is not as powerful as reviewed and has developed a rattle.
5,Minimum rough opening dimensions,"The unit is 12.5"" high and 24"" wide, so your window must be at LEAST that big to fit this in.I couldn't find this information anywhere, so I called Uncle Joe's, who pointed me at Honeywell, 800 382 6693, and they answered my questions.I don't have the product yet but I ordered one based on people's positive comments."
4,Good circulation,"This fan has provided my room with some much needed air movement. It works pretty well with different settings and what not. The ""thermostat"" doesn't really work that well, so the fan tends to just stay on all night rather than automatically turn off when it's not too hot anymore."
4,"Great power, almost too much","I gave it four stars instead of five simply because you can't put it in a 'quiet' operation (other than off). It has more power than I need to vent a bathroom, and to usher in cool night air, and could probably handle a good size room. It's lowest setting is still very powerful, so it's always fairly noisy. If you need the force, this is your buy. If you want it less powerful but quieter, try a Holmes HAWF2030 Twin Window Fan with Comfort Control."
5,does what it says - well worth the money,"Works great. I love how you can adjust each fan separately and have one blow in and one blow out. It keeps the air moving. It is not super quiet on low but for its size, to keep the air moving, it has to have some juice behind it. I would recommend to anyone and since it has a thermostat - could use in attic window or in any room to get fresh air in or blow hot air out or circulate."
3,Not very quiet,"Imagine my surprise when I found this fan at my local Target for $10.00 less. I was also disappointed because it was not quiet and I bought two of them. I also purchased two Holmes Twin Window fans at Target for the same price. They are very quiet compared to the Honeywell. Also, the Holmes have digital temperature control rather than the graduated dial on the Honeywell. I have two of these fans on each of the 1st and 2nd floors of my home. I place them on exhaust when the outdoor temperature rises above 80 degrees and place them on fresh air during the night when the temperatures drop. These fans keep my home cool without air conditioning. I do not keep other windows and doors open when the temperature rises above 80 degrees. I plan to sell the Honeywells and buy two more Holmes."
4,Works Great!,"I like this product a lot. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the 'wings' do not stay in place when pulled fully out. I think I may have gotten a 'returned' fan just based on how it was packed. The locking system would not lock it at it's most extended position. Although this was frustrating it was not that big of an issue for me overall.Another reviewer stated that it fit a 40"" window and I purchased this hoping that this was the case. On the vendor website it states 37.5"" so I knew the risk. Also the other review was 5 years old so design could have easily changed. It definitely only opens 37.5"" wide.Bottom Line: Fits easily into my window and the window screen can remain in place. The fan, at the low setting, is sufficient for cooling. The thermostat works as designed. The ability to control the direction of the air flow is a nice feature. All in all I would recommend this product to keep cool in the summer."
2,works. it's loud,"loud, but fuctional.We don't have to take our screen out to run this fan.the high settings really move some air.addendum, 2012:by now the accordion material that allows for different width windows has cracked and broken, making this a not-so-long-lived window fan. BOO.see if you can find a fan with more resilient material to close off the air on the sides"
1,Loundest ever. I'd give it no stars if i could.,"This is now the third fan i've purchased. And despite the claims on the box, it was the loudest one of them all. The rest did not fit my window. This one fits on the sides by leaves gaps on the top and bottom. It is very poorly constructed."
3,Fan,"The fan has some nice features to it. I like how the vents can be moved left to right. However on the back of the fan are little lock clips to lock the side bars that fit into the window. This is not convenient if the fan fits into a window with a screen. You have to maneuver it on one side to get the side bar fitting in the window while sticking your hand in the back to lock the 2 clips on the right to lock the right side bar in place. When you do this its hard to fit your hand behind the fan and the screen of the window to lock the clips. Most fans have clips on the top of the side bar to lock the side bars in place. Also in the description it states that it is a quiet fan, actually it is not too quiet."
1,Incredibly Loud Fan! Do not buy!,"Despite what the manufacturer claims (Whisper Quiet Operation) this is one of the loudest window fans I've ever heard. On low, the fan is so noisy, it can be heard on the entire top level of the house. On Medium, it can be heard on the lower level, through a foot of insulation. On High, it can be heard throughout the house, even in the basement.I have purchased honeywell brand hepa filters in the past, which do have a near silent low setting. This fan's low setting is comparable to most fan's high setting. The reviews claiming this fan is quiet are lies!It does move air, and the only suitable use would be the low setting in an unoccupied garage.I have since purchased the Bionaire, which is quiet, moving as much air, even on the medium setting. Do not buy this fan, buy the Bionaire instead!"
1,Terrible Product,"I read several comments on here about the good quality of this product, so I decided to purchase it. It worked OK for two days, then when I flipped one of the switches from ""Fresh Air"" to ""Exhaust,"" a bunch of sparks shot out the switch at me and the right fan stopped working. The fan on the left still works, but I'm a little afraid to touch it now...anyway, clearly a defective product. Too bad to get it repaired under warranty I have to spend $10+ to ship it to the manufacturer, and include ANOTHER $10+ for return shipping (that's right, they don't even pay return shipping). So, probably around $25 shipping fees to save a $40 fan. Guess I'm gonna try to fix it myself..."
2,i dont like it!,"i dont understand why people are so excited about this fan. It is loud! The slowest speed is way too high.I bought this fan to use it at night so I dont have to run AC, well this fan is almost as loud as the AC. I am disappointed. I wish there was another speed setting for night use.This fan is too powerful and too loud."
5,Great fan for the price,"I bought this fan because my house is small and all one story. In the spring, we have hot days but cool nights, so it is not worth turning on the air conditioner. This fan works great, especially when you set it to exhaust and open one other window on the other side of the house. It pulls cool air in, bringing down the temperature of the house. The fan is a little loud, but not so much as it would keep me awake at night. All in all, a great fan for the price."
4,MS,"Another good Honeywell product. No problems yet, none expected.I would recommend Honeywell products."
4,2 1/2 out of 3 fans survive,"3 units purchased September 1, 2006. Two are still doing the job while one developed a problem with one of the two fans. One side still works, the other side the fan motor will turn slowly and will no longer start even with a nudge.Nice removable grill that allows easy cleaning of grill and fan blades. We have kitties so the inevitable wads of hair that accumulate must be cleaned off.Nothing to compare these fans with but they do seem to be fairly quiet on the two lower speeds. I'm debating replacing the one fan with the same unit."
1,This fan blows hot air,"This fan got generally good reviews which I don't agree with. It's noisy and can be heard throughout my house. It doesn't exhaust or create enough negative pressure to allow fresh air to enter a nearby window. I can bring in fresh air when blowing in, but that doesn't help cool any other rooms. Also, the side panel adjustment lock is on the outside of the panel, so you can't adjust it to the window easily from the inside.In short it is a big dissapointment, and I would return it but it's a hassle and then there's the postage cost.I guess it's a matter of physics... you can't expect to move a lot of air with such small blades. Don't waste your money."
5,Perfect window fan,I recommend this window fan for anyone who wants to cool a room off without spending the big bucks on electricity for an a/c.
1,Noise,"I bought this fan for a bedroom window, it works well BUT, this fan makes so much noise that I canot use it anywhere in the house, it mite make a good garage fan!!"
4,does the job,The fan has a number of options that are helpful. You can bring in air from the out side or reverse to pull hot air out. You have a number of fan settings which is nice. Overall I would recommend I may get another one for next summer.
5,does not compare to other models - superb,"I bought the Holmes model similar to this and it was like a battery powered fan, very weak, and as promised it is manually reversible (that means you open the window and turn the fan around).This honeywell fan blows it away. Incredibly powerful for the size and a super convenient switch to reverse the flow of air, plus the bonus of only running 1 at a time. great product."
2,Annoying Rattle,"I purchased this fan and really like the overall design. I like that you can remove the grills for cleaning and it is pretty compact. But one fan is ""quiet"" and the other has an extreme rattle. Unfortunately, I already threw out the box, so I can't return it. I have to replace this item and will be hesitant to buy another product from this manufacturer."
4,"Good fan, strange temperature control","I love the power of this fan! I was dying in my college dorm room without air conditioning until I got this fan! I am a little skeptical about the temperature control feature though...for one thing you are not selecting actual temperatures, but rather differently sized squares indicating some sort of scale... I have an actual electronic thermometer in my room and the fan does not always turn on consistently when the temperature rises. Whatever, powerful fan, works for me. By the way, an amazing setting to use is to set one fan to blow the air OUT of your room and the other to blow air IN to your room...amazing breeze!"
4,Nice and cheap,"The fan works perfectly, cools my room and circulates air as advertised. It is just a bit too loud and heavy. Even on low setting the fans are quite loud. I am used to it now but whenever I walk in my room I hear a sudden surge of fan noise."
2,Dosn't fit,Dosn't fit my window(the fan is too deep)And on low it is very loud to loud to use in my bedroom and sleep at night.
3,It is noisy,"This replaces an older version of the fan. This one, however, is noisier than our original. Otherwise, it is a decent, durable fan."
2,Not what I was looking for,"It just didn't have the umph I needed. Might be good for a small space, but I just didn't notice a lot of air flow."
1,Basic product information is missing,"I own a house which will be 200 years old in 8 years. I need window fans for the upstairs, which gets extremely hot and stuffy. Due to the age of my house, the windows are quite narrow (22 1/2 inches wide). Nowhere in any of the reviews, nor in the product description, is the MINIMUM width of this fan displayed. The maximum width is mentioned, but not the minimum. Shouldn't it be?? If the minimum width of the fan is too wide for my (or anyone else's) windows, then I can't use it!"
4,Fly blender and Fan in One,"This fly blender has a compact plastic two tow electric fan made of cemented ream beacons which divide one part from the next. Intended to be used in homes or cramped zoo cages, placed ideally near a fishing aquarium, it blends up roving insects that happen to fly in the ""zone"". In 2 years you empty the bag and feed it to the birds or fish, add some salt and then replace the bag. Has enough energy to dry a car battery dead in one month and enough dead fly capacity rarely seen in third world droughts."
4,Great product,"Great fan, a lot of setting, not to loud on low for in the bed room but still enough circulation. I like the ""exhaust"" setting so it will suck the warm air outta the room"
1,Worst Design for a Window Fan,"The fan is very noisy, & the tabs to lock the fan in the window are on the outside. Seems they should be on the inside of the fan to make it easier to adjust in the window. A real hassel to fit into window."
5,Great Buy for the money,I'm using this as an apartment fan for the summer when I don't want to use my AC. This thing is great and it has a lot more power then I expected when I opened it up.Overall just a good product for the money and it's amount of usefulness.
4,Good fan but a little noisy,"Nice fan, but a bit noisy. In exhaust mode, the thermostat doesn't work very well to shut off on a cool night. Side extension release is hard to reach on the outside of the fan. They should have put them on the inside."
4,Good value,I had borrowed a Holmes unit from a friend and thought that it was great except for not being able to control each fan separately or to direct the airflow.So I got the Honeywell. It's about the same noise level as the Holmes and each fan has its own control. There are louvers on the fan so you can direct the air to some degree.I didn't like that the lowest setting was not really that low. Also the panels that pull out from the side to help it fit into the window were on a spring and hard to manage.But still a great buy.
4,"Works well, but a bit noisier than I had hoped","I bought this fan for my sons room, which doesn't seem to get much air flow like the rest of the bedrooms. It took about half an hour to get it installed in the window and then we turned it on. As I said, it is a bit noisy and I would imagine it would be hard to fall asleep with it on. It does an excellent job of cooling the room if the outside air is below about 73 degrees. The one downside that I noticed is that when we have the central air conditioning on, there is no way to close off the fans from the outside, and the heat can come right in. Perhaps Honeywell could consider including a couple of pop off covers for this purpose. If I were looking for a fan again, I would probably get a quiet floor model instead."
5,An adorable fan,I had this unit for about a month now and it has been it has been a workhorse in keeping me cool this summer. It has a slight audible whine and increases somewhat at higher speeds but not enough to disturb me (I had been using a 20 inch box fan that moves about the same amount of air for a penalty of 3 times the noise and didn't even fit in my window). I appreciate the temperature control which stops the rotation of the propellers when it reaches your adjusted setting then restarts them when the air goes above your comfort level. I highly recommend this unit as an alternative to running a power guzzling air conditioner.
4,Reasonable quality for a reasonable price,"We bought this partly because the idea of a twin window fan with separately adjustable exhaust/intake ability for each fan (i.e., you can set one fan to blow in and the other to blow out) sounded appealing. However, we hardly ever use this feature as it doesn't seem to do anything worthwhile. Almost invariably we want the fan to blow in if it's cooler outside than inside, or to blow out if we're trying to eliminate an odor (e.g., from cooking).We paid $40, and for this price it offers reasonable quality; it's plastic of course, and an off white color. Perhaps a tad cheap looking (compared to our much better quality Hunter Century table and floor fans) but for a lower price. It's also a little difficult to keep clean as it doesn't disassemble easily."
4,Honeywell Window Fan,I have had these fans for two years and have had no problems yet. The unit is loud but I just use it during the day in the bedroom to create a draft in the living room. The unit is made in China and has a cheap plastic case. It is UL listed.
4,Great Value for Money,"Many good features for a good price. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the side extenders weren't long enough for wide windows and they were hard to fully extend and close.Otherwise, a great product."
4,Does the Job,"We really needed the fan. We only have one bathroom and it is adjacent to the living room. Having this fan in the bathroom window helps avoid any embarrassment from escaping aromas. It would be a bit loud for a small bedroom, but it does have great power when you need to cool off or aerate a room quickly."
2,A little disappointed,"I ordered this fan based on the reviews here at Amzon. It is a well made product but I felt that the airflow was inadequate, especially when the fan was blowing air from inside to outside. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I ended up returning it."
1,Did Not Work,"Only one side of the fan worked so was returned. Rather blew my efforts to buy on line as a time saver. The part that bothers me the most is that this is a brand new item that is land fill. It didn't seem to have much metal, if any in it, so it probably can not even be recycled. Why can new products not be produced that consistently work. I would certainly be willing to pay double, triple etc for a product that is made well enough to go on and on doing the job for which it was designed. Made of metal please so at ""the eventual end"" it could be recycled. So I'm back using a fan that is probably at least fifty or sixty years old. It bangs and clangs but works.Amazon was easy to deal with and refunded the cost plus return shipping."
3,Pretty average product.,"It's not the best fan but does the job. Relatively quiet and moves a good amount of air. I got this fan because it had the dual intake/exhaust feature. However the side extensions are flimsy and don't stay open even when ""locked"". Furthermore, the directions recommend that you not leave this in a window during the rain...what's the point of making a window fan if you can't leave it in a window?Over all it is an OK fan, but feels relatively cheaply made. If you are going to use this more than just occasionally, or desire to leave this in the window for long periods of time, you would be better off getting a higher quality fan."
4,"Powerful, but loud","I purchased this Honeywell twin window fan to replace a Holmes twin window fan, model 2041. We use this in our bedroom nearly year round to draw air out or in, depending on the weather. The Honeywell fan is much more powerful, but is so loud we cannot get used to it for sleeping. Even the slower setting is much stronger and louder than the fast setting on the Holmes. We will use the Honeywell for an upstairs window instead, to remove heat during summer months."
4,"Nice fan, a bit noisy","I bought the Honeywell fan to replace a Duracraft that was identical, except for the name and the method of extending the side panels. The deciding factor was the rotating grilles which direct the air and which I haven't seen on any other fan. This one works fine, but is somewhat noisier, so I don't operate it above the ""low"" setting at night. Still, it's a whole lot less expensive than AC and keeps the room comfortable. And some people might welcome the ""white noise""."
5,Couldn't be Happier,"Terrific, powerful fan. The construction is solid and the reverse-direction is very handy. I highly recommend this product."
2,Disappointed,"The low setting for these fans is disturbingly loud, and not all that low. I had hoped for a fan that I could leave running while I slept, but one would have to be very tired indeed to sleep through this noise."
1,"Great Fan I'm Sure, if it WORKED.","On a 98 degree day in the city, I opened the box and installed the fan in my window. When I turned it on, it didn't work. After checking all the outlets, etc, I finally had to take it out and send it back."
3,Good but don't expect too much.,"I read all the reviews and this one seemed to have the least complaints. If you beleive the positive reviews you might expect too much. It will make one room seem a little cooler but don't expect a dramatic change in temperature. I seemed to have found that it works best for me when I use both fans to suck out the hot air and then use both to blow in the cooler air from outside. It can be pretty noisy on the high setting but the low setting works well as white noise. Overall, I don't regret the purchase. I won't rush out to buy another one but I am happpy to keep this one. Also, the standard free shipping was great! I ordered it on Wednesday and had it the following Monday!"
4,Good fan,We purchased a Honeywell twin fan years ago and liked it. With the recent heatwave we decided we needed another one. We went to Target (where we got the other one) and they no longer had them. They had another brand. I bought it and it was awful. I returned it and found this Honeywell online and have a nice cool home!!!!
4,Great window fan,Great window fan. Has all the bells and whistles - exhaust or fan with individual controls (can have it on one exhaust and one fan simultaneously) with individual controls for the speed of each fan. Easy install into the window.
5,GREAT!,I love these shift levers! I have a Bacchetta recumbent bike and they are so much better than the twist shifters that come with it.
4,I likes 'em,"Although I'm still reaching to click with my index finger occasionally, I STILL like that i can use my thumb for shifting up and down and don't have to move my fingers off the brake lever. It's especially nice with low-normal derailleur and downshifting on a climb with little effort.I haven't used a wide variety of of decent mtn shifters, but I know that these are pretty great for the cost. I swapped out some low-end shimano brake-shifter combos for these and find these much nicer to use. Combined with a set of Avid Dial 7 levers, these give you a quality, affordable set. I'd recommend them, but haven't had them long. Maybe I'll edit this review after a trip to Moab next month."
1,The Wasting of Time,"This is a pointless book full of ungrounded mental and philosophical masturbation. Don't expect to come away changed by this book. The blurb on the back cover suggests that humankind can change fundamentally but don't expect to be shown how. Oh no, anything resembling commonsense in this book is kept suitably mysterious. It's a maddening conversation occasionally brought into focus by the contribution of Bohm.It is instructive to read what Bohm thought of Krishnamurti's teachings down the track, later in life. Here is an example: ""One may wonder whether such a person as K claims to be is at all possible. But leaving this question aside there is overwhelming reason to doubt that he is what he claims to be."" (page 327 Infinite Potential - The Life and Times of David Bohm; paperback edition Addison Wesley)."
1,A Waste of Time,"K was such a clever businessman. He would invite the gullible Bohm over for ""talks"", then have the talks recorded, then cobbled into a book that his foundation sold for profit; allowing him to travel the world on a virtually unlimited expense account! It's so interesting that K who knew absolutely nothing about physics and had no scientific training whatsoever, always led the discussion with typically ""murky"" questions, such as ""Can there be an end to time""? This book like the other exchanges with Bohm, is mostly a ""big waste of time""."
1,Pass the joint.,"Yuk! and they call this the disemination of ideas.I am with hawkesed (another reviewer) in consideringthis book a waste of ink on paper. Written in a dialoguestyle of Socrates, it was difficult to maintain a line ofthough as these two in discussion jump all over the place.This makes reading difficult for me and surely does not helpthe disemination of any ideas. I'm sure these two hadsomething to say, but they did not say it to me.Purchasing this book was a waste of money and shelf space.Sorry Thomas."
4,Butterfly Kisses,"Butterfly Kisses was played at my daughter's wedding for her dance with her father. There was not a dry eye to be seen. The song totally summed up the closeness between my husband and our daughter, she has always been been ""Daddy's Little Girl"". This song just totally brings everything home to us as a family and the love between father and daughter. Jeff Carson does a beautiful rendention of this song."
4,Confusion,I am trying to find out the female that sings butterfly kisses/daddy's little girl. I am also confused as to who sings this version. It's the last track on Butterfly Kisses CD by Jeff Carson. Can anyone help.
5,This album has the wrong title. More like 12 Gems,"Jeff Carson has the best, most talented voice in country today. The songs like Butterfly Kisses was an excellent remake. He has enough talent to run against Tim McGraw and Alan Jackson.This is worth is people."
2,TO DJ WILD BILL,"I was quite upset reading your review where you credit the wrong person for writing this song. BOB CARLISLE definitely wrote this song. He wrote it for his daughter Brooke, then 16. And after listening to Bob sing it, I can only give Carson, at best, two stars."
2,Credible remake....,"I wonder about the statement in a previous review of this title in which Jeff Carson is credited as writing ""Butterfly Kisses"". In the liner notes of the B. Carlisle release the song is credited to B.Carlisle/R.Thomas. Now, unless Carson's real name is R.Thomas I doubt he had anything to do with the creation of this song. This is a credible remake for those who must hear this song with a more country vibe. Seek out the original Carlisle version, you will be glad you did."
2,1983- (Patricia Hills)Alice Neel monograph MUCH better!,"This new monograph has been released to coincide with the Whitney's retrospective. Both the long over due retrospective and the new monograph are lacking in quantity and depth needed in doing justice to this amazingly prolific and important artist. Abrams' previous Neel monograph had many more images and excerpts of important interviews with Neel throughout the book (provided by the forsight of Patricia Hills.) The new book, under the Whitney museums' auspice, includes interviews with some of the sitters. While these anecdotes are interesting it doesn't make up for the total superiority of the 1983 monograph (reprinted in 1995.) If you can find a used version of the previous monograph, you would be wise to aquire it. I also recommend Pamela Allara's ""Pictures of People, Alice Neel's American Portrait Gallery"" which puts Neel's work in a cultural context (from the depression through the feminist movement.)"
2,"Wanted to love it, but ultimately disappointed","Very portable and easy to use. But it eats AA batteries like no tomorrow and pictures were not as sharp as I expected. For landscapes and pictures when you have time to set up your shot, pics are beautiful. Love the panoramic mode for this. But I found that unless the sun was directly behind me, there was a glare-y halo on my pictures that made them look fuzzy and washed out. And, yes, like many other reviews here, the flash takes forever to recharge.Not really a 'bad' camera, but I expected better from Nikon."
3,Quite good but...,"I was expecting a better product from Nikon.The quality of the images is not the problem, in fact is quite good. I think that the first problem of the camera is that it doesn't have image stabilization, this makes virtually imposible to take pictures without flash or a tripod couse it will allways be blured.Movies are also shaking a lot because of the same problem.I've read about the time it takes to turn on and that it takes a lot of time to recharge the flash between shots and I bought it knowing that, but using the camera you notice that after every picture you take."
3,Good but slow,Pros:PriceSimplicityFeaturesQuality results in normal environmentsCons:Recycle time in flash modes unacceptable!If you need to repeat a shot you must wait 6-10 seconds before ready. This will not work in spontaneous shooting or gatherings with restless people especially kids. Nothing beats continuous mode in SLRs.Consider Canon for speedy digital point and shoot.
1,Do no buy it,"It takes too long to focus and shoot! This, coupled with the very long time it takes to write to the memory card, well, it is horrible. People who write in saying they didn't notice the the slow focus and writing, must be either paid by Nikon or total nubs.Do not buy this camera.It did take decent movies, and the size is nice."
2,i returned it,"i bought this camera based on an older 3mp version a friend of mine has that i liked. the older model is far superior. this camera is slow to focus, slow to shoot, and slow to save. i took 5 pictures in a row of the same thing in the same lighting condition (indoor, medium light) on the automatic setting, all 5 pictures turned out different, only one turned out clear. i returned it the next day and bought a cannon that i am very happy with."
2,Nikon Coolpix L6,"Disappointing. This is my 4th digital camera and I thought this was an upgrade. At 6 megapixels, I expected sharp, crisp photos, but they are not. Writing to the card after each shot is very slow. Look for something else."
1,Nikon L6,Poor and slow Focus and flash. Thought Nikon had a good name.......WrongIf you like this camera it must be you first digital.
3,"Good concept, nice design, Bluetooth average","I love the design and the concept. The sound is great!Unfortunately, the range isn't that great (it would be better with BT class 1) and sometimes, when I loose the connection once in a while, it reconnects to another Bluetooth audio device (my neighbors TV - if he knew :) ).The documentation is really bad. Here are some instructions, that can't be found inside the manual:1) If it is automatically connected to another (undesired) device, press the button for about 2 seconds to drop the connection so that it's open again for being connected to your device.2) To pair it with your PC, you need a pairing PIN, it is: 0000"
2,Loses signal very easily,"I bought this device so I can listen to music from my LG Chocolate on my home stereo wirelessly. Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that the range tops out at about 15 feet. At greater distances, the device loses signal very easily, which requires a tedious pairing reset process.I also found that it loses signal if you try to do too much with the phone- for example scrolling through songs while one is already playing. It keeps the signal if I just setup a playlist and leave my phone near the device.On the plus side, it looks slick and is quite small. It integrates very nicely with my entertainment center."
1,yuck.,"Let's be quick here:-line level output was very low, so your attached sound system must be cranked way up, creating gain structure issues, signal to noise issues, mismatched input device levels, etc.-poor receive sensitivity, so your Bluetooth music source must be very close to the WBT310-just plain nasty sound qualityThere are lots of other devices on the market like this, only much better. Don't waste your money on this unit."
3,does what it does,"At twelve dollars its a steal, but the technology is limited and it can't compete with airtunes in regards to quality. There's occasional static, and my computer is never more than 6 feet from my stereo. but on average the quality is good and i'd recommend buying it. Its not a perfect item, but its a perfect price."
2,Good when it works,"Its cheap. It works moderately well.Pairing is easy. Once paired, the sound quality can be occasionally choppy, but this is generally not bad enough to be a huge turn off.The major con I've observed is that reconnctions with a bluetooth audio source (like a laptop) is not something that happens very smoothly. I often have to manually turn it off and on to get this working.If you're looking for a cheap way to get a PC quality speakers to hook up your laptop while surfing the web and listening to music, youtube etc., this might be a good buy. But if you are looking for a higher fidelity experience with a high quality speaker system, you might want to invest in something else."
1,dont buy,"This receiver has poor audio quality with intermittent static, the price is low and so is the quality.My PC was about 10 ft away from the receiver and there was still static, and the music just sounds really bad, flat."
1,Quality- None,"I opened this up and plugged it in. I paired it with my computer as per the instructions, and set my computer to use it as audio output. After about a minute, I shut it off. The quality loss on this thing is absolutely horrible. My sound is immensely distorted and sometimes not even understandable. I do not recommend this product to anyone. Definitely returning it."
2,Telephone quality,"I was able to hook this thing up to stream from my laptop. My laptop normally runs sound at 48000hz, or dvd quality. the jensen was only able to get me 8000hz, or telephone quality. So it is not worth it if you expect to play high quality music."
5,AMAZING!,480 fps this cheap in a metal pistol!! I love mine!! Plus it's Daisy so you know it's quality!!
2,Daisy Air Pistol,I cannot give a fair review as the air pistol jammed the first time the trigger was pulled. Item was returned and a refund was processed.
3,Good basic starting point.,"This book was helpful. Not exactly bubbling over with information but it does give a good insight into what it takes to be an image consultant. I really appreciated the information on training programs and supplies that the book offers. This book seems to give a very basic look at this industry that most people already interested in this career might already know. Such as...image is important. Overall this book is a good read, and a great place to start for a person very new to this business, also there are so few books about this topic that it is just nice there is a book to let people get their feet wet."
4,Image consulting,This book is very interesting and very complete. You will find everything you need to know to become a successful image consultant. It gives you also lots of references to complete you research of information.Highly recommended for anyone who wants to make it in that business.
5,Autry and Champion,"No one like this singing cowboy and his horse. In a (movie)world filled with excessive bloody violence, these Autry movies are a real pleasure to watch over and over again. Film quality is also very good!"
5,Also a good book on C,"This book isn't just a handy reference for programming in C in the UNIX environment; it's a useful reference for any C programmer. For example, the discussion of file I/O is very clear."
5,Excellent book,"This book gives an excellent introduction to systems programming in unix. Within a couple of weeks of buying this book, I was able to design and implement a multi-process client server (socket based) application from scratch. The author also discusses the common C library functions used and the caveats there of. (for instance, the gets() function is a dangerous one!) Although I program a lot in windows NT, I still find this book to be a good reference, especially when porting applications from unix to NT. One thing that I wish the book had is a discussion on remote procedure calls (RPC)."
1,Not true to John Gardner's Grendel,"I am a high school English teacher. My class reads John Gardner's Grendel in conjunction with the epic poem, Beowulf. Not only is the animation painfully dated (and not in a cute Flintstones or Rocky and Bullwinkle, Fractured Fairytales way) but the movie trivializes and jumbles the novel. Bumbling characters are added to Hrothgar's entourage... ye gods this movie is painful to watch.An actual line from the movie... ""King Hrothgar's official message, ""PUSH OFF!""Seriously?And why is Wiglaf a part of Hrothgar's entourage? Gah.If you are a purist to the epic poem, Beowulf or the novel, Grendel don't pick up this movie."
3,Average,"This ""model"" was very easy to build. For its many pieces i put it together in about 2 hours and it held up ok for about a year collecting dust. the problem was that it was so long and heavy it couldnt be played with or moved and when i tried after the year it bent and cracked in the middle. So it became knon as ""Titanic the II"""
5,The USS Kittyhawk,"(...)Very good model of one of the Naval Fleet's largest Aircraft carriers. The USS Kittyhawk is memorable and filled with fun. The time it takes is at least 6 hours to build. It's not hard to make just hard trying to find the pieces for that step. You could also add it to a Abrams tank, Tactival Fighter, and a Destroyer to make your own army. Get a bucket of legos and build an enemy base to defeat. It provides days of fun for you and a few friends. Thank you for reading.(...)"
4,Wowzers,"I actually bought this product almost 10 years ago while i was in the navy and had nothing better to do, really tedious build but still fun and the size is amazing, the only downfall is Price!!!! it was 79.95 8 years ago, i guess i wont be rebuying"
5,better than legos by far,"I adore this model so much. I have the biggest lego/megablocks collection of anybody I know.This model is certainly the biggest and best edition to my collection.My favorite part about the model is it comes with 8 f-14 aircraft, although it doesn't come with any f-18s or helicopters.I really like the SAMs(surface to air missles)but i think it needs some deck guns.The AARS(advanced air recovery system)is really cool.This model stays together very well, better than some of the lego models. So far this is my favorite set i built but i cant wait to get the Sea Wolf."
5,a very good toy for someone interestd in the military,"If you ever had dreams of being in the military, then this toy is for you. The Aircraft Carrier i around 3 feet long with 8 micro machines type F-14 Fighters. It is an idel model for someone who is very patient, for it took me about 8 hours to make. The stickers are rlatively easy to put on, and it comes equiped with 2 elevators to lower or rise, wit storage spac inside. The ship comes with 5 wheels on the bottom so it can go just about anywhere. An if your a real Aircraft Carier enthusiust, and know how the planes take off and land, then you will find this one a great buy. Since this is a MEGA BLOKS brand, it is much larger and less expensive. The LEGO brand would have this priced [much higher]. I recomend this for anyone over 5 cuz it takes a lotof perserverance and patience."
3,Black and White,"We bought an old house with an old yard that needs a revitalization program, hence the purchase of this book.Well, the good and the bad of this book is that it is in black and white.It has illustrations that I love. The illustrations are of a man next to the plant in question, which gives you a lot of perspective on what that plant is going to be at maturity. It's great, I love that.It has black and white photos of the plants. I hate that. A black and white photo of a plant just doesn't help much. You have to look the plant up in another book with color photos to see what it actually looks like.The book has good information on the varieties of plants, how much to water, where to plant, etc. It is just too bad this one book could not be THE book instead of coming up short."
5,Pray Hard by Pamela Walker,"I don't consider myself a very religious person. And while the title gave me pause, the book itself was not at all ""religious"" in the way I expected. It certainly lends itself to any interpretation from holy intervention to something more ""other worldly"", if you believe that WE are all connected in some way. The characters are funny and the plot engaging. I wanted to finish it all in one sitting.I expect to use it as a ""read aloud"" with my 7th grade language arts classes in the fall. I think they will love the narrator and Brother Mustard Seed. I know I did.....Upstate NY ELA TEACHER"
4,Works great! Not quite as large as I'd like,"This cargo net is very good for the price. It is very stiff, which can make getting stuff set underneath it a bit interesting, but this is a necessity for properly securing things while riding at speed on a motorcycle. This product secured my schoolbag loaded to the gils while traveling at speeds ""in excess of the limit"" on the highway with absolutely no budging.My only negative comment is that if this product were an inch or so wider, it would be much easier to situate items on my 2002 SV650. Newer bikes generally have thinner tails, however, so this may not be a problem on new bikes."
3,Nice net - buy locally and save shipping charges,This is a nice net which has been very useful. I later found the same size net at the Harley dealer at close to the same price. I could have saved shipping charges.
3,You will be lost if you want to start from the beginning,"This is definitely a reference manual, don't expect to learn from it if you are a beginner, you will feel in the middle of nowhere for anything you look, if that topic is not something you knew but you forgot"
2,Disappointing purchase,Seems to be an okay resource for people just getting started. However it is completely inadequate as a reference. Better resources are available on the internet for free.
4,Printing error,"So when I first purchased this item this book was missing pages 17-48. Amazon was kind enough to respond by email within 12 hours and create a one day shipping order to replace the book. When I got the new book it had pages 17-48 twice! Now this could be a low probabilistic coincidence or the factory that manufactured the set of books Amazon received had a problem with when assembling the book. Either way, having the pages twice is better than having them zero times.As far as the book goes it seems like a fairly well written book (although I must admit I have not read much into it). I have seen many of the complains people have written and I personally think they purchased the wrong book. This seems like a very nice introductory text for those who have no experience (or very little) with LaTeX. If you're looking for a more in depth coverage - obviously this is not the text you're looking for. You get what you pay for."
2,Not the whole Document Preparation System,"One would expect a lot more for the price of this book. Instead of being a comprehensive guide or even complete introduction to LaTeX, this book is a nearly cursory introduction.Commands and options are not described in detail, leaving a lot of guesswork in doing simple tasks like laying out equations, including an abstract, or including graphics. How to program your own environments is left for the Latex Companion. The reference section in the back is poorly laid out and missing quite a bit of information.The book is a good introduction for those who have never used LaTeX but gives very little for one's money; books on other computer-related topics, from C to HTML tend to be more comprehensive. I'd recommend this book only because there aren't many basic introductions to LaTeX in existence."
3,"You'll need it, but ...","We TeX-heads (with apologies to Knuth that I didn't say TeXnicians) should all bow to Lamport for his LaTeX package, a masterpiece of macro programming and design. That said, while you'll need a copy of this book with its handy tear-out card as a reference, it is not the best way to learn LaTeX. For that you need ""LaTeX Line by Line"" by Diller. The problem here is that Lamport created the package, but he hasn't organized the material very well to explain it. I remember back when I first encountered LaTeX (circa 1987) and tried to learn it with only the first edition of this book. That was truly an excercise in futility. It's much easier to come up to speed by NOT using Lamport's book as your primer. But go ahead, buy the book. You'll need the command reference and that little fold-out card... ."
2,"Don't get this - Get Kopka & Daly's ""A Guide to LaTeX""","I thought I hated LaTeX - in truth, I hated this book. This book gets you started and then frustrates you. I believe the author tried to be concise and cut too much. After struggling with this book for way too long, I bought Kopka and Daly's ""A Guide to LaTeX"", which a great book; it has a good introduction for beginners and serves as a great reference for experts. Skip the pain I went through and just get Kopka and Daly."
2,"Adequate, but there are better books out there.","Leslie Lamport's often cited ""Latex"" book is an adequate guide to this document preparation system. The problem with this book is that it's slightly too complicated (and dated) for absolute beginners (when I was learning Latex, I tried to read this book but couldn't and ended up using ""The Not So Short Introduction to Latex"" - available on the internet, instead), while not being detailed enough for more advanced users. At only 272, there just isn't enough there to be of much use. I also own a copy ofThe LaTeX Companion (Tools and Techniques for Computer Typesetting)and I find that I use that book far more often than this one. This book is adequate if there is nothing else for you to look at, but there are better books out there that you can spend your money on."
4,Very good book for all level users!,"As a person fairly new to TeX, I found this book most helpful. I made a surprising discovery this summer while working with professional scientists who write almost everything in LaTex: many of them used this book, too! It, along with it's companions, are THE reference for many of these scientists. The one shortcoming of this, as well as every LaTeX guide I have seen, is that it doesn't explain how to include external postscript graphics at all, something we all need to do, it seems."
3,Be warned...,"This book had the makings of a great romance novel. H and h grow up together, horrible villian, they escape together, they find a savior....then it goes off kilter...an added mystery that just does not make any sense what so ever!!!! I finished this book on a 6 hour flight, so it is a short read 245 pgs. The big ""misunderstanding that keeps the lovers apart"" is ridiculous. The h even says it in the book, ""do you think I am so stupid to allow that to keep us apart?"" Then every other page in the second 1/2 of book is ""the h is so beautiful""...I am all for a beautiful h, but I feel it took up space and was too repetitive. The character of Mike (dad) was not fleshed out, it was such a short book that had much potential. Finally the evil villian in the second part of the book was like....dropped out of the sky...I was thinking, where did this come from? I am used to more fleshed out characters, if there is a mystery it is played out well and this did not do it for me."
5,A Keeper!!!,I love this book!! I've read it over and over again. I have given away a lot of books but this one is a keeper!!! It's one of Dallas Schulze's most touching and best.
5,Love the lenses.,"Of all the sunglasses I have tried, the Polarized Sandstone lenses reduce eye strain better than any other. Since it may make a difference to someone else, these fit nicely inside my motorcycle helmet without pinching or pressing."
5,A Gorgeous Book!,"This is a very lovely little book. It has no words, only beautifully-painted pictures. The little mouse scampers over a blank book and carefully chews away at the page, revealing the ocean underneath. He proceeds to make a little paper boat with the page and sails away to adventures on the high seas."
2,Good vocals and great bass player,This is a decent band at doing covers tunes. Good vocals and a very good bass player. St. Somewhere is missing a good guitarist. There is a ton of great music out there for purchase. This CD is not one of them. Fun band to listen to live.
5,Excellent LCD,"I found this TV sitting among some notable brands in the store: LG, Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, and Samsung. I was surprised to see that the picture was on par with the Sony and Samsung and outclassed the others (the Panasonic was skewed too much towards red and the LG and Sharp both seemed lifeless in comparison). The hi-def on this TV is excellent (both component and HDMI) and even the regular S-video looked great! Also, there was no ghosting to be seen on this TV.The most amazing part about this TV that I found out when I got home was its speakers! I was surprised by the limits of their volume, all without distortion from the bass they were pumping out. Makes me not need to go out and get a home theater setup! Overall, I would recommend this TV (and the Toshiba name in general) to anyone.*Just remember that you need to get a cable box to watch TV on this LCD*"
2,Eh,"This microphone has provided me with somewhat acceptable results. If you are new to recording, you probably find it very beneficial on acoustic guitar, male voice (can sound harsh), female voice (can sound harsh), and with guitar amps if you are careful. Mine broke a little after six months and I'm pretty sure that the pad and high pass filter didn't work. So, I would rather save up a bit more and buy a AT4033 used (absolutely great microphone) instead of essentially ""wasting"" my money on this.I guess it is a learning experience."
5,"AN OUTSTANDING WORK! I WAS DEEPLY MOVED ,","For anyone with a sensitive heart, I cannot imagine a better gift than this book. The emotion which runs through these pages is so simply expressed and so genuine that it is almost possible to overlook the fact that this --- at its core --- is a wondrous work of art. There is a natural quality to Robert Sexton's prose and drawings that I have never experienced on paper before. Reading it; seeing it was like witnessing the best parts of my own life again, as if they had been lost in time, then suddenly carried back by Sexton's mind and heart and pen. I have begun to make a list of all of the people I haved loved in my life, and I plan to share this book with each of them."
1,Knights of the Nine,I can't use this game because I can't dwnld. the code as I have windows 7 You should warn folks of this. Because now I won't be buying anymore games at Amazon.
4,Better than nothing,"If you have not played the origional for a while it does take some time relearning the controls,etc. Playing with a character who has good equiptment and good stats makes this addition too easy.Some of the other mods mean you are wandering from point a to point b for a new residence."
1,Install Woes,I was unable to get this to install. Checking Bethesda's web site on the error number and message was an exercise in futility. The error was listed there indicating it was most commonly caused by not having administrator rights when installing and refers you to Installshields site which is totally useless. The account I was logged in as had administrator privileges. I also tried it logged in as administrator and still no luck. My system configuration is more than adequate to support this product.
1,"Despite the hype, a letdown","I'm going to shock everyone. I don't like it. Why? The game doesn't save. I have trouble with all the different keys. Oh, and I keep getting killed.I was really hoping to give it a good review, but atlas, I can't."
1,MISLEADING INFO,"I was terribly disappointed because this particular product is an expansion pact and this was NOT clearly stated!! I bought it as a gift, expecting it to be the video game and ended up buying the expansion pact and was really really annoyed. if it's not the game, IT SHOULD BE CLEARLY STATED, right up front.the rating is low, but who knows what the game is like?"
5,More Expansion Fun!,"This add-on is indeed terrific fun. There are so many more facets to the World of Oblivion to explore, and this is simply one of them. The quests herein blend wonderfully with the usual Oblivion Quests. Some of the quests don't really do more than give you more than another place to stay or store your stuff, but they're still cool. But other quests add hours of Monster killing action. It was worth the money, especially here on Amazon."
2,Product sizing runs small,My brother has been wearing size large in thigh high medical hose for over ten years and over that 10 years has worn different brands with no problems. I ordered these on-line and had to return them because he couldn't even get these size large over his heel.
2,Very Tight,"I purchased this product after very carefully selecting the appropriate size. I even went to Truform's website to get the specific measurments for each size, paying close attention to the thigh measurments.When they arrived, I tried the stockings on and was shocked with how tight they were on my thighs. In fact, the top band left a visible ""ring"" around my leg! They were so painfully uncomfortable that I immediately took them off, repackaged them, and sent them back to the seller for a refund.I gave this product 2 stars only because the stockings arrived as pictured with no runs or holes or visible defects, and the material used was good quality.If you decide that you are going to purchase these stockings, be forewarned that the sizes seem to run small. Here is a link to their sizing chart:[...]As for me, I think I will stick with the knee high and full length/above the waist styles."
2,Very hard to get on and off,"I ended up returning these compression stockings. I'm 7 months pregnant and could barely pull them part of the way up my leg. You really need the help of another person to get these on. The compression was far too much for me (and I know I had the proper size). I'm also not a fan of the thigh high. I thought I would be, but it's really uncomfortable to have something that high up on your leg bunching up all the time. I ended up getting a knee high 15-20 compression instead and I'm a lot happier and still feel like my legs are getting good support."
3,Didn't stay up good,"My husband uses the stockings for varicose veins that he has, He likes the knee high length a lot better, especially because these do not stay up when you are walking around."
2,Disappointing,This product was a disappoinment from the get-go. The silicone button bands on top would not stay up. They kept rolling down.This was not worth the money and I will never buy this product again.
2,could not wear,I should have followed other reviewers advise. Could get hose on my legs and felt good however the band at top of thigh was too tight. So uncomfortable and painful I had to pull down to below my knee to wear. I was running errands and could not remove. Comfortable hose but band is just too tight. I have ordered others that stay up and are comfortable.
4,Just as expected,"I miss the closed toe! The open toe was the best price, but I like the closed toe tights best"
5,Luke Thant has a killer of a case.,"Dorothy Simpson's DEAD ON ARRIVAL presents the reader with a complex page turning who done it. Insp. Luke Thant has a victim, Stephen Long with his head bashed in by a blunt instrument. Stephen ranked high on the hit list of everyone who knew him including his own mother.This traditional police procedural will keep you turning to pages and guessing as Thant wonders and discards suspects only to return them to his list as new evidence against them rises to the surface.A classic you should take to the beach and enjoy.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
5,SUPER WEIGHT,"I LOVE MY PAPER WEIGHT, I HAVE IT ON MY DESK AT WORK AND GET COMPLIMENTS, BIGGEST FAN OF SUPERMAN, THANK YOU FOR YOU PROMT SERVICE."
4,Parties,"Have to say that I was rather dissapointed in book, expected more! Never than less it is fine book to read, wont make you a caterer over night but gives you an idea."
5,very good book,"Book is well written and the material is well organized. Attractive layout, a pleasure to look at and read. Lots of handy reference information. Free from obvious errors such as typos and layout problems. Might also be useful for the home cook to get some organization tips for planning meals."
2,Absolutely no pictures,"I expected to see a caterer's flair for presentation and exceptional recipes. The recipes are quite ordinary and there are no pictures whatsoever for party presentation. What you get are tables to multiply ingredients for 12 to 75 people. If you've ever taken a math class you can do that yourself. I was not impressed with the menus, but I'm a foodie, so maybe I expected too much."
5,sophisticated but easy,"This is my new favorite book because the flavors are sophisticated but the recipes are easy! Interesting recipes in quantities for 12, 25, 50, and 75 are hard to find. I will probably use this book more for filling my freezer with family dinners and for brown bag lunches in single serving containers. The advice is practical. Plus there is tons of fun extra information, substitutions and saving time or money. Even decorations and invitation ideas are provided if you want to knock yourself out.So far I have cooked the Arabian Nights menu with Marrakech Chicken and Lamb Tangine. Both were well received at a luncheon meeting for volunteers and by my husband. With Tabouuleh Salad, Minted Yogurt Sauce and Pita for side dishes, I didn't bother trying the Chocolate Baklava, but will do so another time. The recipes seem to be well-tested and accurate in portion sizes. Both the chicken and the lamb were rich and complex without using chiles."
4,National Symphony Orchestra-recommended recording.,"When I attended an NSO performance of ""Ma mere l'oye"" at the Kennedy Center, last month, this was the recording recommended in the program notes. It met my every expectation."
5,Neighbours From Hell 1,Worth buying! It will give you many hours/days of challenges and a great deal of laughs! I would say the first of the 2 in this series is the best (the second of the two wasn't so good). The graphics are beautifully drawn and rendered and in a cartoonish style.
1,Boring and repetative,"This is THE most boring game. First it doesn't let you place objects in obvious places- you have to play the same ole level over and over again until you find out which item the GAME wants you to put where. Like you find a felt tip pen and you should be able to mark anywhere with it to make the neighbor mad right? Not in this game- you can only mark family portraits & on some pics it won't work either.It's set up in the old ancient ""see 2 or 3 levels"" all flat like a comic book page. The tutorial was worthless and it is hard to use. Once you figure out what item to use where- it's not worth the nieghbors reaction which is the same all the time anyways- he gets red in the face and steam pours out his ears- oh WOW, now doesn't that make you want to play the same level (from the beginning) 5 times to see? NO!!!"
3,Not completely worthless,"Definitely better than her Falling Woman, but not even close to the Hobbit (And I understand that is not the intent). Worth a read, but could have been shorter."
4,Unique take on an old classic.,"I am a fan of Tolkien's work, the Hobbit and the Rings trilogy. When I initially became aware of this book, I was a little skeptical that the author might be using Tolkiens great story as a crutch for a mediocre writing style. Despite my reservations, I picked it up.And I was glad I did. This author definitely has her own style, which is solid and distinguishable from Tolkien's. The story does not run parallel to the Hobbit in all ways, which is good.All in all, this is a good, fun read for sci-fi and fantasy enthusiasts alike."
5,I used to admire Paula Deen,"But after reading her book, my respect and admiration for her beyond words.This is a woman who has survived and not even that, has thrived beyond anyone's dreams. There were parts of her book when I got chills and as an author myself with a little guy, I could relate to her drive and desperation to build her business. My circumstances aren't as dire as hers were but after reading her book, I ended with a sense that if Paula could do it, I could too!And Paula if you're reading this, I just love it that you use ""bawdy"" language! Sometimes gumdrops just can't express certain feelings.If you enjoy an honest, no-holds barred ""conversation"" with a dame like Paula, read this book."
4,Interesting Story,"I enjoyed reading this book. I have seen Paula Deen on TV for the past 4 years and I like her style. The book gave me a closer look into the person, not just the cook. She has many interesting people in her life and I like how she is very honest and up front about the part they played in her life and her untimate success. If I ever get to Savannah, GA I will stop by The Lady & Sons restaurant, I won't mind the wait in line. Thanks to you Paula for sharing your story with us.Carrie.Tracy, CA USA"
5,Paula Deen It Ain't All About The Cookin',A fantastic book about a truly amazing woman who deserves everything that she has attained in life. She told a life story that most people would never tell that are in her position. She is a remarkable lady.
4,It Ain't All About the Cooking....by Paula Deen,This was not what I thought it would be....but I enjoyed it and kept it.
5,Paula's book is cookin',This book was so easy and fun to read. Paula's writes like she talks. I admired her courage in starting a business. She never allowed herself have the option of giving up.
2,the books doesn't help me like her,"l liked to watch her cooking shows even though they never turned out for me like they did or her. yes that ya all is cute but sometimes a wee much. even on qvc she dishes it out thick, but tell me why do we buy her pots and pans??? she is southern but no lady, her use of the f word is just a tad too much really being only 1 year younger then her, no l did not sleep around so yes l never talked about it thank you. yes sex sells but when you are a cook why do we need to know way to much about her bedroom doings. she used people to get where she is big time, seems proud of it. sorry l just didn't care for this book hope a,ll ladies from the south aren't like this thank you."
5,Just amazing....,"Paula Deen is an amazing woman with an inspiring, touching story. I never would have imagined the incredible woman I have enjoyed watching on tv had such a history. A definite must read for any Paula Deen fan!"
4,don't mess with Christmas !,"I laughed, I cried, and I agreed when she said ""don't mess with Christmas."" She was determined to provide for her children and hold her family together and she did it. I admire her honesty, and the fact that she's not ashamed to say she loves her family. We need a ""Paula Deen Movie of the Week""."
4,Another Paula Deen book I just love,Although this book doesn't have the amount of recipes in most of Paula Deen's books it is an interesting read about her life and how she became the cook everyone loves - hard work and determination plus a love of cooking have brought her into our homes. If you love Paula Deen you will enjoy this book but if you are looking for a selection of Paula Deen recipes try one of The Lady and Sons books.
5,paula deen rocks,the best book biography i ever rea. good resipes. need to by it. gives you a great life story of her.great buy.
3,Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cookin',This is not a literary masterpiece but it is a down to earth commentary on a lady who came from nothing and achieved financial and personal success.
1,Not a southerner,"Yikes! This was given to me on audio, and being one who always finishes a book once started, I am forcing myself to listen. Perhaps I should have read the printed version, but this woman is getting on my nerves big time. Her ""poor darlin' sons who needed her so bad............"" For heaven's sake - they were in their 20's! Late 20's!!!!! Many of us hve been in a bad marriage, battled hardship, and thrived. I'm glad she was courageous enough to do so also. However, it isn't a life story I would ever recommend. Oh - and to keep seeing the married man while in ""love"" with her soon to be second husband ?!?!? Is this normal?!?!?!?!? I can't wait for the final CD so I can stop suppressing screams of frustration while listening."
2,Paula is a party,"Where to begin? I bought this book for my mom for her birthday and since she was out of town for a while, I decided to read it first. Well, now I'm too embarrassed to give it to her. Don't get me wrong, I am glad she overcame her illness and everything else she had to deal with, but some of the things she says are just filthy.Just because that's the way you talk at home or to your family doesn't mean you should put it in a book! God! Come on. I was raised by Southerners who didn't know the difference between good and bad grammar but I'm sure Paula knows the difference. And another thing. So much of the book doesn't even sound like Paula. I think huge sections are basically her ghost writer's words because Paula's ""voice"" just isn't there. I agree with the other posters that said to save your money. You can get most of the story from her shows.Oh, and Paula's Party show stinks. It is almost too painful to watch.Lucky"
5,Great Book,"This book is wonderful. If you like Paula Deen and ever wanted to know more about her, this book will satisfy that need."
5,What's REALLY cook'n at Paula Deens?,"I was sad to read the last page of this delightful book. Once I started this delightful read I was immediately taken into Paula's world. Her candar and her sense of humor throughout is delightful. She is a kind, grandmotherly-like Auntie who speaks just what she believes, never mind what YOU think!! Her recipe interjections are helpful and the spice of her life and yours should you cook some of what she shares. I loved the book and hope she'll write more about her life. I think such a read is VERY helpful for those who may be considering starting a food-related business be it restuarant or catering...after reading it you will be better educated whether to take that plunge or not. I highly recommend this book to any Paula Deen fan or anyone that embraces an honest, forthwright woman of whom she certainly is. Her celebrity is hard-earned and greatly deserved...Cheryl-Tacoma,WA"
5,Wonderful Read!!!,"This is an easy and wonderful read full of heart and the highs and lows of Paula's life along her road to success. She tells her story with sincerity and in a way that is just delightfully Paula. She shares her secrets, her heart, and even shares her ""how to's"" for someone wanting to do what she has done.Reading this book makes you feel like you're reading a letter from a dear and close friend. One of her many gifts has always been her ability to connect with others and she easily extends this connection through this media.This book can easily be enjoyed by anyone, whether or not they cook. It's the story of a woman who may be a lot like your friend, or neighbor, or sister, or mother, or aunt, or you. It's the story of a woman and her survival."
4,It ain't all about the cookin',I enjoyed the book. It was a fast read. It told her life story and had much humor in it!
1,If you like Paula Deen on Food Network don't read this book,"I was a HUGE fan of Paula Deen before I read this book. Based on her Food Network Chefography I was looking forward to learning more about her struggle to succeed and the more personal side of her divorce and rebuilding at age 40. However there are some stories that don't need to be told. While her life wasn't picture perfect it was pretty close. The introduction on her show makes it seem as though her husband left her at 40 and she had to scrape together pennies to put herself back together. That is not the case! She left her husband, she slept with a married man for 10 years and she used her sons as workhorses. While she does own up to most of these things and I can appreciate her honesty I can no longer watch her show or her Smithfield commercials. If you want to read a wonderful story about a Food Network star, pick up Made From Scratch: A Memoir by Sandra Lee."
4,Woman with guts,"Paula is a woman who has guts and determination but like all of us she ""aint perfect"". She went through alot and came out on top. She is like most of us. Reading her book, I thought we could be friends"
5,I read two thirds of this book within the first 48 hours I got it!,"I just enjoyed this book so much. Paula has so much spunk, is so down to earth and highly spiritual at the same time. She has so much incredible wit and wisdom. What a lovely person Paula is, inside and out. I work at the Visitor Information Center for Virginia Beach. The first time I heard about Paula Deen was over three years ago when my co-worker Jill went down to Georgia to cook with her. Jill shared her Paula Deen cookbooks with me and now I cannot get enough of Paula Deen. I watch her show whenever I can and her movie Elizabethtown is due to arrive in my mail today. I cannot wait to see it. Paula's recipes are so fabulous and yet she encourages you to add your own touches to them. I feel like I know Paula after reading her book, but actually I feel like I know her when I watch her on the Food Network as well. My co-workers and I think so much of this unique, creative, special woman!"
1,Not for gamers,"Wussies of the Coast has completely destroyed the game this time. Their committee approach to game design has resulted in a bland, watered-down, thoroughly boring system. Character classes are now completely meaningless. Humans-in-funny-costumes Syndrome (HifcS) is now complicated by every character having access to every skill and every feat. Why not just play GURPS?"
3,unnessesary redo,"Okay, i've been DMing version 3.0 for a couple years, and so my characters are fairly far along. I picked up the DM's guide and monster manual 3.5, and found it easy to convert those aspects. only one thing, no players handbook 3.5! i needed the new spells, so i got it, and thought it would also be easy to convert, too. Boy, was I ever wrong! they took off some skills that my PC's used extensively (animal empathy) so I had to let them re spend those. the ranger in the party had so many changes, he had to redo his character, as so many of the abilities he relied on were removed. I ended up not useing the ""revision"" (except the spells)at all! So, if your an experienced DM and use 3.0 rules, stick with it as far as players go, or your in for a nightmare. I gave it 3 stars because if you are just starting a campaign, it would probably be better. get the DMG and MM 3.5, as the improvements are useful even without the PH 3.5 (some Spell like abilities may need changing though)."
1,Not Very Authentic Version,"These rules are cumbersome and don't really capture the spirit of the original game.Rather than inspiring creativity, the rules cover too much. The bizare character feats and options will mean the DM will spend hours trying to roll up an NPC. Creating adventures is a nightmare and combat in this rule version is slow with an overemphasis on miniature wargames.The rules have the atmosphere of medieval superheroes or computer games rather than the original settings based on the writings of authors like Jack Vance, Fritz Leiber and others.The artwork, while well drafted and in colour, has the feel of a video game.They are very poor value for money, especially as the rules changed from edition 3 after only 3 years.If you want to get into Dungeons and Dragons try getting hold of the 1st edition AD&D; books. If you want to learn the game, try the D&D; basic rules from the 1980's - they're actually much better."
1,The Wizards money-(...) machine,"After borrowing the Third Edition Player's Handbook from other gamers, I decided to get my own--and then I found out that Wizards was coming out with this Version 3.5. So I decided to hold onto my money until it came out. ... I think the new charts are a bit nicer/more organized, especially the huge Feats chart. And it seems that some classes, such as Monks, have been tweaked a bit (now you can do Flurry of Blows with weapons)...yet the Spells have also been tweaked (the Shield spell only provides a +4 bonus to AC now). Also, 3.5 does not point out the new changes throughout the book...I guess if you have read the old Handbook, you would know the changes anyway, or if you were a newcomer it wouldn't matter what the new changes were in the first place. But dangit, now we have to learn stuff all over again!!!..."
1,If you already bought 3.0 dont bother...,"First, I will ignore the economics of the new version.I would also add that before buying you can find a list of changes on the WotC website, if you own 3.0 already check it out.With this in mind I would conider this a unneeded revison. By far the most changes were to spells. For example, Polymorph other and polymorph self become Polymorph and Baneful Polymorph, not much difference other than duration. Also, Harm has been reduced to 10hp per level damage. Does any one out there with a PC cleric actually prepare Harm? (as reviewed in Dragon Magazine)The one cool thing I found in the revision notes was that a Paladins warhorse is now a summoned creature. Very useful for those that travel by sea or Teleport often."
1,Awful... burn it before you read it.,"3.0 was a breath of fresh air into the D&D genre. A new system with new rules that kept most of the flavor of the 2nd edition of the game. 3.5 was not playtested, that much is painfully clear, there aren't any playtester credits in the back of the book. 3.0 had two full pages of fine print playtester credits. It can be summed up in one sentence: Some idiot out-there's houserules for actual D&D.Darkness spells light up rooms, druids turn people into frogs, dragons and horses are square... Pathetic. my only fear is that a new generation of gamers pick this peice of garbage up and begin to think it's D&D."
3,"It's good, but it could have been great.","I liked this update, it saved the ranger. But it didn't do hardly anything for the beleaguered fighter and sorcerer, nor did it curtail the out of control codzilla (the cleric and druid classes, which are considered by many to be overpowered). This version also seems to be heavily based on minis, which not all of us in nerd-land collect them.All in all, however, it's good. Those classes that did receive updates are better for it."
4,Hard to judge...,"This is a hard product to judge. I like it just a little bit more than the 3.0 product. There are still some errata in it (unfortunately, some of the same ones that carried over from the 3.0 product). But, on the whole, I think things were cleaned up and re-thought.If you're a rules-lawyering powergamer, this edition will bother you. Just to let you know."
2,Not worth it other than as a replacement,"as my title states, this run of D&D is only worth the cash, if you are replacing your beat up copiesof the 3.0. Because that is just another WoTC plan to get more money out of us.. Nothing too new to be better than below average.."
4,Still the one,Dungeons and Dragons is still the best and most popular table top role-playing game on the market today. My only complaint about this book and the game in general is the sheer volume of companion books you have to get in order to play the game. It'd be nice for them to break down one day and make a good all-in-one product for a change.
5,Great Price for a Great Book,"Being a new book, the price was great. I saved money over buying it in the store. Even after the shipping, which was well handled, I had this book in just a few days, and now I am using this book every day.As for the item itself, if you have an interest in D&D; you must get this book. It is a must for any D&D; player. And on top of the endless supply of information this book provides, it also has great art to go with it. I found this book in itself fun."
3,No longer the only book you need to start,"Well, I like the additions WotC made to the D&D 3.5. Some of the rules clarifications and balance adjustments were definately needed.What I don't like is the fact that they removed the mini-monster manual from the back of the book. The best thing about version 3.0 was that if you didn't have a lot of money you could buy just the one book and actually play 1 or maybe 2 levels of characters before NEEDING the Dungeon Masters Guide or Monster Manual. Now you MUST HAVE all 3 core books. For people on a tight budget who'd like to start upgrading this just STINKS!!!I know people who would love to purchase the 3.5 version to start playing D&D again (they hadn't played since version 2) but now they can't consider it for a LONG time.Why Wizards removed what was a great ""get you started"" piece from the book is beyond me. It just goes to show how truely interested they are in Money over their customer."
1,This is NOT Dungeons & Dragons,"This is not Dungeons & Dragons. It is a cartoonish parody of what made the game great.d20 system? It's a clumsy, unintelligent mockery of what the game should be about - playing a role well.I have played all editions of the game and recently made an educated decision to return to the original rules and play the game the right way, once again. My players are happier, I'm happier and the game is fun again."
4,From God to Us,"I'm only part way through the book and so far I'm learning a lot. A person has to like reading technical writing to enjoy this book, it isn't for the casual reader but for the student who wants to learn. It's an in depth study on how the Bible came to be and why the books that are in the Bible were chosen out of all the scripture that had been written. Now the trick for me is to be able to retain all that I read so I can have an inteligent conversation about it when the need arises."
5,"A fascinating, clear, self-refuting work","I highly recommend this book to both religious and non-religious readers. It sets forth very clearly the theological position for the bible as a god-given book, which will serve the interests of the religiously inclined reader. For the atheist or agnostic reader, it similarly well demonstrates the weak logical and historical position of the theologician. After reading historical/ academic works such as ""The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture"", I found this book to be fascinating - honestly, I couldn't put it down."
4,quality tack lifter,I used this while restoring an antique steamer trunk and it served very well in pulling out the tacks and nails that are usually bent over or turned back into the wood on the inside of the trunk. This tool allowed me to dig out the bent nail from the inside first to minimize the damage to the wood before pulling it out from the outside.
5,"CLASSIC, HEARTFELT LOVE SONG!","TIM AND FAITH ARE A ONE OF A KIND DUO WHEN THEY SING TOGETHER. YOU CAN SEE THE LOVE AND EMOTION IN THEIR EYES WHEN THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER. THEY ARE JUST AWESOME, AND THEY SOUND SO GREAT TOGETHER. THIS SONG IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LOVE SONGS EVER RECORDED, AND IT REMINDS ME OF MY LONG LOST LOVE I FOUND AGAIN AFTER 13 YEARS. IT IS NOW ONE OF OUR SONGS, NOW THAT WERE TOGEHER AGAIN, AFTER ALL THIS TIME. THANKS TO TIM AND FAITH FOR GIVING LOVERS A SONG TO LIVE BY!!"
5,Tim McGraw has a voice that seems to reach out and grab you.,"I love almost any song Tim McGraw sings, but when he and Faith Hill team up, its out of this world."
3,Poor Shipping Practices,"I do not understand why you would bill me on (September 1st) and not ship my order until (September 7th). I know Labor Day was on September 6th; however, you had 3-days,"" Wednesday, Thursday & Friday"" to ship my order prior to the holiday weekend. So, in summary, I paid for my merchandise on September 1st and it is now September 10th and I have an estimated delivery date of September 13th... that's just about half of a month between billing and receipt of my merchandise. As per our experience and other reviews that I have read, it looks as though you need to reevaluate your policies & procedures..."
2,Not sure what the fuss is about???,"I purchased this after reading tones of reviews from various websites. I have broken out while using this, when my face was clear and I hadn't had any spots for 6 months. This mousse cream feels very much like wax and smells like it too. It does however sink in fairly well and doesn't feel greasy, but although my face doesn't feel dry afterwards, it doesn't look very hydrated either. It leaves the face looking dull and l'd much rather have a healthy ""glow"". I won't be buying this again. Will use it on my chest and stomach to get rid of it fast as it does nothing for me."
1,not right for me and smelly,"I have really oily acne prone skin so I decided to try this out. Firstly, it smells really gross, almost like some weird asian herbal medicine scent.The texture is like a gel, and it feels weird on my skin. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I don't understand why it got such high reviews?"
3,absolute moisture,this product works well overall but i didn't like it as much as the other bioelements moisture creams. i use it at night and after my suncreen
5,Country Boy sings with heart!,"Where has this man been hiding? Truly he is one of the most exciting and gifted musicians to come down the pike. ""Blind Dated Woman"" is one of the best songs I've heard in a long while.Look for more things from this talent.Good Job Mr. Conniff!!"
2,Disappointed in California,"I have been waiting months for a new book by Mr. Greenwood and was excited when this book was finally published; but alas, I was extremely disappointed in 'Texas Homecoming'. The story is slow, boring, very little action, and all gibberish. The two main characters, Cade and Pilar, had nothing in common except old family feuds. They just didn't click with their boring personalities, which I contribute, in part, to Mr. Greenwood not providing his usual character buildup/background. The bickering between grandparents and Cade and Pilar started to annoy me about a third way through the book.I can normally finish one of his books in less than two days; this one required a lot of determination to finish.I loved and kept the Bride and Cowboy series, but this one just isn't worth keeping. However, I will try to give Mr. Greenwood the benefit of the doubt and will await the second book of this series, and hope that it rates at least a three."
3,Good,It was an ok book. I felt like it was missing more of thrill. Glad I read it. Glad I got it for free
4,Good book,"Very good book, kept me on the edge and had to keep reading. The story line was great and the romance was perfect."
4,describes an execellent personal understanding of tai chi.,"This books describes, in a personal way, a deep understanding of tai chi. The sort of book that seems to be written by an old friend, by a chance meeting on our crossing paths.A non technical book, but a book that allows tai chi to reflect the our personal growth/development (or breathing the sweet air, in tai chi speak!).Carries on the work of Girda Geddes and Bob Klien.The book holds a braveness of heart that encourages us to explore ourselfs with tai chi.Marageret helps to disolve the barrier of teacher/pupil; a book well worth reading.Thank you Margeret.hartley davies (kax88@dial.pipex.com)"
3,Great gift for my nephew.,"For Christmas, I got this doll for my 12 year old nephew. He was very happy and got the hang of the mouth pull very quickly. I was a bit surprised (because of the price) that parts of the clothing did not have finished seams, and the shirt is not a complete shirt. Overall though, my nephew's reaction at opening the gift and how happy he was to show it off to his friend, I feel good about this purchase."
1,Don't waste your money!,"My 10 year old son saved his money to purchase Danny O'Day. He was very excited he finely bought one, only to be disappointed in the quality. Very hard to operate the mouth without the whole dummy moving around. Shoes won't stay on his feet. It's very clumsy dummy to operate! Mouth sometime sticks open not a smooth movement."
4,Iron man dvd,Good toy for my grandson. He liked it.. Was a great christmas present for a little boy. Great price in it.
3,sweet.,"Redheads everywhere. It is great, way better and different than the movies. Aniimated like the awesome Batman movies. Not as good as Batman and the Red Mas, but hey what is... Iron man as a teen, team work, KO'd in every episode, not a spoiled rich, only super genius, brat, playboy none Super hero like Tony Stark in the movies. Set in the near future with other super genius, rich, techno - mages (Babylon 5) like villians. Great imaginative young writers, well directed,acted, drawn. I'm 29+ and will be watching more."
3,A Promising Writer and an Exciting Story,"The other reviewer went into great detail about the plot, so I won't; rather, I'd like to communicate my experience with the book, both Pro and Con.Pro: Exciting story line, exciting locations, brisk pace, visual in placesCons: writing came across strained, style was very choppy, characters did not have a lot of depthI realize that this is a relatively new author, and it shows. The sparse style is difficult to pull off for many authors, but I ""get"" that the author is trying to find his voice. While the style was a bit sparse and the language often stilted, the ideas were great. There is clearly enough promise here that I will not hesitate to pick up the author's next novel."
4,An Exciting Tale,This was a great tale; exciting and riveting. I became invested in the characters and had a hard time putting the book down. This story is made for the movies.
