4,The water tastes better now,"This Crystal Quest tap filter has proven to be just the bee's knees for our water problem. We can now drink the water directly from the tap without gagging on the taste or smell of it. It is not perfect but does the job we hoped it would. It is small, convenient, easy to instal, does not leak and has good pressure. I would recommend this product."
3,Not quite a biography,"This isn't really a biography. It reads more like a bunch of shallow record reviews strung together with some contextual info. To be fair, some of the quotes from people who knew him, especially in the 60's on the English folk circuit, are interesting and revealing. Although the book breezes thru most of his career, it spends far too many pages debating the morality of his making ""Graceland""."
4,I couldn't sleep after reading this one,"This book contains excerpts of actual recordings taken from the ""black boxes"" of airplanes which crashed. Black boxes are those voice recorders which monitor the voices of airplane pilots and often contain details which explain how and why a plane crashed. Author Malcolm McPherson has brought to life the last moments of passengers and crew during the worst kinds of emergencies imaginable and I doubt you'll be able to put this one down. In many cases, the recordings have never been shared in their entirety before so this book is a rare chance to get details you might not read about otherwise.Some of the incidents are famious (such as the 1996 ValuJet crashin the Everglades) and others are less well-known. McPherson does have a few errors in this book, mostly in explaining the terminology of aviation but his basic information is accurate and only the most diehard aviation buffs will mind the errors."
2,Disappointing,"A book of CVR data that is all in the public domain already, edited by a non-aviation writer and littered with basic errors. It would be over-stating the case to say this work is offensive to those who died and their next-of-kin; nonetheless, it adds little of value.The good and interesting parts of this book are the CVR extracts. If you are interested in CVR data, check the NTSB or AAIB websites. If you want to read well-written accounts of air crashes written by someone who knows a bit about the subject, try MacArthur Job's 'Air Disaster' series."
2,Disappointing,This is a book that covers the CVR recordings of many well known aviation accidents. However it should be pointed out that almost everything in this book can be found on the internet. Unless you just want these transcripts for some compelling reason you may find them at no cost on the NTSB web site or any number of others. Caveat emptor!
2,It helps to know about the crash before you read this book,"Unfortunately, there is nothing new in this book. For the most part everything in the book, except for the few comments provided by the author, is available on line and most sites include much more detail. The CVR in and of itself does not tell the whole story and a little more background on each of these disiasters would have helped to make this a much better book. If you are not familiar with the accidents in question this book will do more to confuse and create questions than to provide you with insight and information."
5,5 stars just does not do this book justice,"The book is a facinating look at all elements, not only human but enviromental factors that have caused some of the most horrific airline disasters in history. I am an airline enthusiast myself and I really could not put it down, I found it fascinating, and must thank the author for not censoring it like may other authors > would have done, leaving it in its entirety has done both the author and his book > justice."
2,I was disappointed,"Being a frequent traveler, I was compelled to pick up this book. After having read it, I feel more technically knowledgeable about the components of aircraft flight, but the book still left something to be desired. I didn't find it as ""chilling"" as other reviews had promised. It was interesting, and kept my attention, but not quite as scary as I had anticipated (and I'm easily frightened!)"
4,Compelling Reading,I suspect the reviewers who were looking for excruciating details are more of the anorak/spotter/enthusiast persuasion than certificated fliers. Personally I found many of the transcripts contained lessons that will certainly follow me into the cockpit. The CVR transcripts also show a level of professionalism and skill that I think the flying public is by and large oblivious of.
3,Nothing new,"If you spent any time reviewing CVRs, then there is nothing new in this book. Although there are several inaccuracies/mistakes, the worst part of the book is that it gives almost zero insight into what happened in each case. A short one page write-up at the end of each CVR would really help this book."
1,PLAGIARISM,"This collection of CVR transcripts from air crashes and near misses is a huge waste of money. MacPherson just reproduces excerpts from the transcripts that can be found on the internet at the NTSB website and many other sites. In their complete form and for free. His short paragraphs of explanations of the incidents involved add nothing to the book because it is obvious that the author knows nothing of aviation. If you are a true student of air crashes, look up the complete accident reports on the NTSB website or avsaf.org or a number of other sites. These are free and much more informative. Black Box is a cheap excuse for jounalism. I'd actually give it less than 1 star if I could.[...]"
2,Disappointing neoRomanticism,"A lot was made in the program notes about Liebermann's fondness for tonality and other vestiges of Romanticism. While there is nothing wrong with that and, in fact, it's a welcomed trend after so many years of aimless atonality and minimalism, however, there is nothing new in the way that he treats his materials. I fell in love with his Sonata for Flute and Piano years ago, but for me that was his high point. This music left me with a ""ho-hum"" feeling that will probably keep me from listening to his music in the future. I'm very sorry to have to say these things. I would like to give him praise, however, for the third movement (Largo) of his Symphony No. 2. If the rest of the music had been up to the quality of this moving, and original, movement then we would have something to rejoice about. Unfortunately, it doesn't."
5,Modeling and Sculpting the Human Figure,This is the top rated book according to our instructor. It is the most thorough book of its kind since sculpting has become a sort oflost art. Our instructor is a professional sculptor and his work is in museums around the country and has sculpted for Hollywood films.I find the book very interesting and helpful. It is a bit old for today but it is an excellent guide for the beginner as well as the professional.
2,modelling and sculpting the human figure,"too much text for a visual clay beginner, maybe more helpful for more advanced person"
2,TOO MUCH CLASSICAL,"A to much classical style for my taste. There is an extreme rigour, out of date nowadays. Besides, it presents few photos and hands and feet are forgotten!"
3,"Two movies, one review","I was looking for QUESTION OF FAITH, which seems to be only on VHS and out of print. I had found it helpful, informative and inspirational a few years ago, and look forward to getting a copy somehow.The Amazon reviews refering to the monastery and catholicism belong, I believe, to A QUESTION OF FAITH, which sounds like quite a different movie."
1,A very poor science fiction pseudo-religious drama,"Never before have I seen a movie script that treats the subject of miracles in such a shallow, silly, and simply ridiculous manner. Miracles are supposed to be events that go BEYOND reason, not contrary to reason. I had to force myself to see this movie through the end. Would you consider reasonable a ""miracle"" where your dog slowly starts to become a cat? Or your car turning into a boat? Take a ""miracle"" like that and sprinkle some cheap biblical spice on it and you can probably come up yourself with a better and more believable plot. This is a very, very, very poor movie. If you are into religion this movie will probably find this movie insulting and annoying. If you're not, you will likely find it just plain unintelligent. Spend your money and time someplace else."
5,Good replication,"Straps were a close replication of originals on my 65 Twin. Fit was perfect and the look was good, replacing the original straps which were rusted beyond fixing."
3,The author should use a few more pronouns,"Well, first off, I did not read the entire book, but from what I've read, it's a good and interesting story. Maybe perhaps because of the battle scenes. Definitely good to introduce young readers to the genre. But the one gripe I have is that this author should really use more pronouns. I see ""Corin says..."" and ""Corin drew his sword..."" and Corin this and Corin that. Sure, that's the character's name, ok. Well, you don't really need to tell the reader his name every time Corin does something, do you? I saw every line or every 2 lines. It sort of became annoying for me."
4,Good read,"I enjoyed the first cities novel, but this one was a much better read overall. The characters are very interesting especially the Gnome and I hate Gnomes. The action is excellent and the plot interesting. Ok it is a little predictable, but I will forgive it that as it was just plain fun. It is certainly worth a read if you like Forgotten realms novels."
5,"Majestic solo guitar album soars ""Beyond The Clouds""","This is a very beautiful guitar album. Doug Smith has a liquid technique on the guitar, and his music seems to flow effortlessly. His solid technique is second to his compositional gifts, in which he balances beautiful soaring lines with cool tapping and artificial harmonics. My favorites are ""Millenium Force,"" ""Dance of the Gnomes,"" ""Beyond the Clouds,"" and ""A Nursery Rhyme."" In the end, the guitar is only the tool by which the spirit of the music speaks, and Doug Smith is a master composer and musician."
4,Hodgman/Ayoob,I know D.A. Hodgman and can assure you he is not Mas Ayoob.The books in the series are very good taken for what they are: pulp fiction.
1,Simply Doesnt Work!,DO NOT BUY. This product is junk. I tried to use it with several different computers and no luck.
4,Short & Sweet,"The reasons that it only gets three stars is that for a collection there are only eleven songs ranging from 1965 - 1973, and also the songs that are omitted. The quality of the music on the disc itself is fantastic; I must admit that I was curious to see how earlier tracks would stand up in surround. I think the sound images are placed really well considering the age of the material on offer. Not included are tracks such as; how sweet it is (to be loved by you), you're all I need to get by & too busy thinking 'bout my baby, also older tracks like sexual healing are also missing. With the body of work an artist such as Marvin Gaye produced, there should have been plenty of scope to include B-sides, rarities & live tracks on the disc. Although it is short with not a lot of features - just the basic lyrics and photo gallery, the price amazon's selling represents value for money."
2,NOT impressed,"I am playing this DVD audio in a acura that is capable of playing DVD audio. This is the first DVD-A that I am NOT impressed with. On the other hand, if you are a big fan of Marvin Gaye...it may not disappoint you. Just dont expect this DVD-A to sound as good as others."
1,Horrible transfer of sound.,The worst audio recording I ever bought on dvd-audio.His estate obviously doesn't care about his fans in my opinion.The recording sounds like listening to music under water. It's Horrible.
3,not the best sound,"The song list was good, but I was expecting more from the DVD-Audio. It sounded like any other CD"
2,More or less a CD on A-DVD format,While the music is just great this is really not a good example of what DVD-A can do. It sounded like a quick port of the CD over to DVD-A which is not what I was looking for.
2,Poor Audio Mix,"I purchased this disk along with others to play in my Acura DVD-A system. I found the overall audio quality to be a bit disappointing...and the mix to be a bit ""over the top"" with surround effects. Major vocals coming from rear speakers, etc.I also found the overall sound to lack the brightness and crispness on this specific disk. In fact, the demo disk for my TL has the Marvin Gaye song ""Let's Get It On"" and it is remarkably brighter on that disk than on this collection.If you are looking for DVD-A disks with 5.1 surround...I'd pass on this one and maybe purchase the CD of this album."
5,Great information about cholesterol!,"With much confusion in my mind about cholesterol, this book clarifies many of the controversial concepts about this naturally occurring item in our bodies. The book explains cholesterol's necessary role in our bodies in easy to understand terms and sites many important studies that have been done over the years. Learn what really causes heart problems. Analyze the falsehoods circulating out there from this well-written, short, informative book. Read it and learn many truths!"
5,Super cute and super comfortable,"I love this sweatshirt! The colors are great, it's good quality and it's really soft and comfortable. It is a little tighter than a regular sweatshirt -- I'm a street size 0/2 and it's hard to push up the sleeves -- but it's very cute on and just looks like it's supposed to be fitted. Be aware when ordering that if you want a looser fit like a regular sweatshirt, maybe order a size up from your normal size."
4,"Larger than it looks, but very nice","I like this a lot, but it is probably not going to look very good on a smaller person. The pendant didn't seem so large in the online picture."
2,Not Impressed,"I used this product on the scars that i have on my arms. I know this is designed for acne scars, but it indicates that it can be used for other types of scars as well. I've tried other scar treatments before, and nothing helped, so i decided to give this product a try. I don't see any significant improvement. It seems that the scars would fade and look a little better, but for a short period of time - then the effect wears out and they are back to looking the way they did before."
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this for the dark circles under my eyes and because it's from a company I trust. However, it doesn't really do much for the dark circles. It is a thin product, so you only need a little bit, which also means that it's going to last for ten years. I found also, that when I put it on it would make my mascara smudge after a few hours. I would get even darker circles from my mascara smudging. It's an average product, but probably not worth the price."
3,"Storyline ok, but overall movie is slow.","Not keen on the inspector and few things he says are inappropriate. Ultimate storyline is good, but the movie moves pretty slow."
3,More hype then substance,"Rented this one while it was hot off the press and was ready for an entertaining thrill ride...it just didn't happen.The visuals are stunning and the set pieces and references are colorful and abundant, but the movie, plot and conflict of pace will (overload) your head.The film is busy and relies too much on flashbacks, time shifting and coincidence, which cause a lack of flow and continuity in the story. It's not until the final quarter or so of the movie did I see the film finally hint where it was going, up to that point I just kept waiting for something to happen.Slow at times, after it ended I was serioulsy curious where all the hype came from...maybe I was just burned out on the publicity and had too high expectations. 4 stars for setting and 2 for plot, notchy acting, and uneasiness of story..."
2,Boring,"I rented it, watched in 3D, and fell asleep after 45 minutes. Next day I finished watching it fortified with coffee. Still, outside of occasionally nice 3D scenery I found it a boring experience and I could not care about characters. I am not sure why the movie was made."
2,Expected Much Better,"Very disappointed. How this is considered a childrens movie will be mistaken, too long boring with poor story line.Beautifully made scenic wonder, but at the end should have been 40 minutes shorter."
3,"ok, but not great.","Could have been so much better. Weak story line after a bit, I actually got bored to be honest. Wasn't bad for a kids film but I'm not sure that's what Scorsese was going for."
5,A Work of Art For Everyone to Enjoy,"Some movies are put-together, some are spit-out, other are even made, but this film was crafted. It is rare in this ADD world to see a work of art, but Hugo is that and more. Excellent acting, a great plot, wonderful pacing, and scenes that will both excite and tug at your heart strings. For the old, the young, and everyone in-between I can't imagine anyone not enjoying Hugo."
4,Hugo,"We felt it was a wonderful family movie. The children enjoyed it as well as the adults. The ending was terrific and very happy. The boy had a difficult life yet he harbored no ill feelings toward the young girl that was granted an easier life with her gardians. It was a shame that the boy had to steal in order to eat, but the times were tuff and he really had no one to provide for him after the death of his father. Truly a good movie."
2,A big disapointment,"I wanted to like this movie but just couldn't get into it. The placement of the characters seemed as though they were there only to extend the film to a normal two-hour production. There were bits and pieces of a few stories just thrown together to make a movie and call it complete. There was an idea to this picture that never really got off the ground and the whole thing was a certain bust. I was even expecting the mechanical robot to have more significants to this movie, but he also left me feeling as though he was added to fill the gaps of a flat film. This was boring. In fact, it took me more than three attempts to finish viewing film as I kept loosing interest in hopes it would get better, but I was determined to reach the end. When I did - Bam - A big disappointment. I gave this movie two stars only because I enjoyed the cinematography and the streets of Paris looked like art."
2,"Visual, but the characters and plot, garbage","I actually yawned. Im not sure why this thing made it to the academy awards (there were better films) but it really left a lot to be desired. Come on, a kid, a key, an orphan, and then...oh my god the ridiculous story of the old man and his wife. It was just...ummm. whatever. I could have done without it.I really did give it a thumbs down."
5,Great Movie,"This was a great movie! Well done, If this movie was for purchase i would have bought it but thankfully it is free on Prime!"
5,A Must See Movie,I cannot believe all the things I saw in this movie! The scenery and props used were wonderful! I felt like I was in the train station and part of this movie. Wonderful acting and a great story! Go buy this!
5,Well Satisfied,"Product was exactly as it was described, new and I received it in just a week. I was completely satisfied with my purchase."
5,Hugo movie watched,"Excellent movie which I had seen at the theater, but wanted my spouse to enjoy it as well. He liked it too!"
5,Hugo,A wonderful tale of a young boy finding a home and allowing others to start dreaming again. You just need to watch the movie to enjoy it. This movie is set in the 30's and its hard to state whats so great about it.
3,"Do NOT expect much. Average film, it is","First of all. Movie does NOT really have any good story line. Everything sort of forced together to fit some how. it could very easily be a theatrical play since the entire movie takes place in a small section of train station. Ben Kingsley a great drama actor was wasted in this role. Characters in the movie are shallow, none has any impact into the story line. Movie is not for young kids ( ages between 4 to 12), because it is slow and boring. it is not good for teenagers, again slow, boring, no action and it is not even feel good or romantic movie. As for rest of us, movie makes no sense at all, due to weak story plot. If you can rent it, please do so before you spend any money to buy it."
3,"Rent, don't buy","Ok. Visually pleasing, but a plot that seemed contrived. We never got fully engaged watching it. Worth a rental watch (especially if you have Prime) if there is nothing more engaging in your watch list."
3,Perhaps,"The premise is wonderful, much work was done on the sets, the acting was good, yet, it failed to ""engage""."
2,A little disappointing given the hype,"Cute enough movie and it has some nice special effects, but predictable, unoriginal plot. An OK kids' movie. Stick with ""Up,"" I'd say..."
3,Flat storyline,"I was so excited to watch this movie, but for all of the Hype and praises it was a major disappointment. The movie was pretty to look at, but I thought the story was a bit thin. Could have been a great movie if the story was fleshed out lot more."
1,Waste of time!,I am sorry to say but this movie was so poorly conceived. Yes there were some interesting scenes but there was clearly a mismatch between the different stories in the movie. It was too slow also.
1,Ponderous Kiddie Movie With A Serious Message.,"This film contains a lovely little tribute to the great Georges Melies, and a lovely message about the magic of the cinema. Well and good, nice enough and all that. Alas, this tribute and message are contained in a kiddie movie of downright elephantine ponderousness, about some kid living in a railway station who winds the clocks -- I dare you to give a damn about him, as embodied by Asa Butterworth in what has to be the least engaging child performance in recent cinematic history."
3,Hugo,I was expecting an exciting movie but it turned out to be a tear jerker. It was good but not what I expected. There was a lot of slow action where I thought they could have sped it up a bit. It is based on true events which I did not know before I saw it so that does have something to do with it. It is a good movie all in all.
2,Disappointed...,I like Martin Scorsese very much and he is responsible for many excellent movies. But Hugo is not one of them. I rate it with two stars because of the visual effects. And that is it.
2,A very beautiful but boring movie.,I'm not sure what audience the creators where targeting to because it was too long and boring for a child and not complex enough for an adult. I'm giving 2 stars for the gorgeous visuals and good acting. It needed a better developed story.
4,Not really about the Robot..,"Hugo is a film that was miscast. From the advertisements it appears to be child's film about a mechanical robot. From the trailer we assume that there is something magical about this little robot and that it is the subject of the film. If you see the movie with that in mind, waiting for the robot to take on a life of its own, you will likely become bored or disappointed and lack interest in the real storyline. In reality, the robot is more prop than actor. This might explain why Hugo didn't get a wider audience when it made its theatrical run. Like the real subject of the movie, the fictionalized life of turn of the century film maker and magician, Georges Méliès, there is slight of hand, but in this case misleading the audience does not amaze them. See Hugo, but view it with curiosity about the magic of film making and how synchronicity brings unexpected solutions."
1,Long & boring,"I normally like magical children films, but this movie had no magic in it. First of all I do not understand why people are in love with Martin Scoreless films. He never stays close to the truth, not even in historical movies. He threw in a bunch of things into the movie that had nothing to do with the book it was based upon. He turned this children's movie into a psa on conserving old films, an over two hour psa. Throwing his obsession of old films into this kids movie destroyed the plot making this movie a garbled mess of tossed together bits and pieces."
2,Ready...On Your Mark...Get Set...FAST FORWARD!,"Had my heart been in the right place this afternoon, I might easily have awarded HUGO three stars: The dark-hued settings (especially of Paris) were dazzling; the animation mind-bogglingly realistic; the subtle music by Howard Shore underscored the action brilliantly; and the appearance of Christopher Lee (in any role) always makes me stand at reverent attention and joyfully call to mind his signature role as the evil Count from his signature film (HORROR OF DRACULA - 1958).However, because the expectation of an ultra-clever, ultra-exciting storyline from this extravagantly reviewed, 5-Oscar-winner film was so stratospherically high, its overlong, often standstill plot turned out to be a catastrophic letdown, causing me to nosedive into a near-irreversible funk -- and forced to rely on my remote's fast-forward button more than once."
4,Hugo'n,"Interesting story line, good acting, and oh those special effects,outstanding. Hey listen if this is your kind of movie, and it is mine, I highly recomend it, especially in blu-ray."
3,Another non iTunes digital copy! Ugh!!,"Great seller. 3 stars for product. The not so great review is for the product only. Seller gets 5 stars. I have nothing but disdain for any digital copy medium other than an iTunes Digital Copy. The process of procuring said copy is cumbersome & unreliable. Even after two rounds with Paramount tech support I am still unable to download my ""included digital copy"". My last correspondence was ""nevermind, I will make my own digital copy"". Ultraviolet digital copies will never become mainstream as long as they have these types of issues. iTunes has always been ""enter code & bam it's downloading"". I refuse to purchase a blu-ray with a non iTunes included digital copy. I still haven't seen ""The Lorax"" for this reason."
2,I paid for HD and got SD,"I know that they warn of the possibility that an HD movie, because of technical problems, might be shown at SD. That happened to me, although I don't know why. My Netflix movies, if labeled HD, always show at HD. And when I replayed the movie just to see if it played a second time at HD it did. While I was not charged for the movie due to a forgotten promotional credit, I do believe that if they send out a SD version for whatever reasons, then the customer should be billed at the SD rate. I doubt that I'll use the service again. For the rental price of a two movies I can go with Netflix unlimited one-at-a-time DVD plan. And my set-up plays SD DVDs at a much higher quality than the SD version I watched."
5,"Lovely movie, good quality","We loved this movie, glad we were able to get it with the Amazon coupon a couple months ago. Quality is excellent, process for download/ viewing is simple."
5,hugo,cute show - it arrived safely and was enjoyed. it was part of Christmas so we all got to watch it several times.
4,Hugo,It tugged at my heart strings. I found it sad at times. I did have alot of trouble hearing the conversations in the movie as they spoke so low.
5,Great,"Great movie. Love the lighting/cinematography. Looks great in BluRay. Had read book before seeing movie, and wasn't disappointed by handling of story or the way in which the movie was done."
5,Brilliant,This is masterful storytelling. I love the developing stories of the many great supporting characters. Sasha Baron Cohen's best work.
4,Timeless Classic,Can be watched again again. The silient segments are almost work the price of the collection. The young cast do a good job.
4,Great movie!,"Great movie to watch with or without the kids! Martin scores again, directing another winner.Highly recommend watching this movie/DVD."
3,Visually stunning; script/acting... not so much,"If not for the visuals, this would be laughable. It is sad to think that a backward-looking film; devoted to honoring a flim pioneer, would be so poorly done. Ben Kinsley saves the movie when he is in it. The boy child actor was a poor choice. The female child actor was excellent. The script was a hash-mash and not only hard to follow at times, but left me not really having empathy for almost anyone in the story. It is a shame. Such fine art design, the sets, the costumes, the digital work; how infuriating it must be to spend so much on such an undeservingly thin storyline. I watched it to the end, but cannot recommend it to anyone really."
3,Slow to pick up,"Although, the message and the graphics of this movie are quite alluring, I found the movie to be a little too slow to pick up. The first hour is very uneventful and only well within the second hour of the picture, we truly see the movie come alive. I loved how they presented the old movies and how they were made. The acting was pretty good. Although, I find the Hugo character, very whiny for most of the length of the movie. I think, they should have cast a less sad and whiny character to play the part of Hugo. Not the boy's fault of course, but how the character was imagined in the movie. For me, was good to watch only once."
2,Nobody Liked It,We rented this because my mother was visiting and so we let her pick. She wanted to see it because she heard such great things and remembered all the academy award nominations. I fell asleep during the middle and nobody (five of us watched it) would recommend it.
4,Good movie,"Good story; great scenery/special effects. Good historical setting. A bit deep/emotional at times for small kids, but great for say, 6+yrs old."
5,hugo,"terrific, surprising story. I didn't know much about the story until I saw the film, then I read the book, and it was even better"
5,Hugo,It was an incredible surprise. The story is just fantastic. High quality special effects .A beautiful film by Martin Scorsese. Just amazing!!!
4,Hugo and company,I enjoyed the history of film inside the story of Hugo. The acting was okay. The little love stories were neat.
4,Different and Innovative,This movie was fun as well as thought provoking. I can see why it was nominated for the Oscar. Not something I would have expected from Scorsese.
4,Overall good movie,"THough it plays a little loose with the historical facts, a good retelling of the beginning of cinema and why we create."
2,Painfully awkward,The first 90 minutes are almost painful to watch. The characters seem very uncomfortable and it is full of awkward silences. The story could have been told just as effectively in about half the time. The last 30 minutes finally managed to find a comfortable pace and almost made it worth watching.
4,"Good movie, but it takes it's time","I was really excited when hearing that Hugo was being made into a movie, and after getting the Blu Ray I was amazing at the visuals, but really thought the story moved very slowly. Give this movie a chance, because I think in the long run you'll be happy you did."
5,3D review,This is the best 3D blu I have ever seen. Scorsese designed this film as 3D and shot very naturally in wonderful sets.I would say it is better than Avatar technically.It is a must own blu.
4,Magical,"Lovely story that's beautiful to watch. It's an amazing mix of Charles Dickens and film history, mixed together into visual magic by the great Scorsese. There's plenty here for kids to love. But it's a must-see for every movie fan."
3,To Scorsese: No. Just. No.,"Sorry, Mr. Scorsese! This was a good, entertaining film. But worthy of an Academy Award? Nope. The beginning of the film was a bit off and slow; the plot really didn't pick up until about 40 minutes into the film. The best performance in the film was by Helen McCrory who portrays Mama Jeanne (Georges Melies' wife), but the others were decent. I feel like people (especially the Academy) are only crazy about this film because (1) it's Scorsese, and (2) it's about film history -- particularly honoring that history. There is no doubt that Melies was a visionary genius and his films are legendary, but this story and film of his involvement with a curious, orphaned boy sort of seems like something that should be made in the tradition ofMars Needs Moms,The Polar Express (Widescreen Edition),Beowulf (Unrated Director's Cut), andDisney's A Christmas Carol-- those performance-captured computer graphic films."
5,Got a great deal on this great movie!,"This movie was great, i found a really good deal on Amazon, way cheaper than you would get in a retail store. The movie was visually stunning and the story kept my full attention during the duration of the movie. I highly reccomend this film."
3,Hugo,This movie was interesting but didnt meet all of the hype from reviews I had read. My kids thought it was ok...
3,a little disapointment,"I just write this review to let people that are expecting like I did that the movie will have some sort of action that they could be disapointed. Based on the preview which I should know by now always shows the best moments of a movie, I was thinking this movie could be categorized as fantastic and would show some cgi or action scenes. It is not really the case. It is a nice little story I agree but not very exciting to me."
4,cinematic excellence,"Incredible visuals, good storyline and nice characters. Hugo is a masterpiece visually. It is very entertaining tail thanks to the great actors that follow Hugo's journey. This is a nice story of a very unfortunate orphan that follow his heart and discovered an important message that changes his life."
3,Intersting story,"This is an interesting movie to see, it feels a bit like a short story that was made into a movie (mind you, are some really good short-stories out there).I liked the narrative, and was expecting something much more science fiction (the automaton generates that expectation, I guess)All in all a nice way to spend a cold Sunday afternoon."
3,MY GRADE: B minus to B,"A charming tale about a historically alternative Post WWI French society based around a metro station with many clocks. A 12 year old boy named Hugo is an orphan after his drunken uncle dies but he secretly maintains the clocks not wishing to be discovered as that would mean he would be sent off to some scary orphanage. It won five Oscars, including Best Cinematographer and the the Golden Globes gave Martin Scorsese his third award for Best Director. B based on Brian Selznick's novel ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"". STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: B minus to B; CINEMATOGRAPHY/3D: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday."
5,great effects,"Hugo creates magic out of a book.Wonderful movie, great book. Can be watched over and over just for the sound track."
3,"pretty, but... meh","Visually this was amazing! Like watching a moving painting. But the story was only so so. Actually, the story had potential but the final product seemed to miss some development. But all in all, I would still recommend watching it."
1,I endured it for 15 minutes,"I rented this on Amazon and suspect if I was less than eight years old and had never seen a movie before, this plot would have held my interest. But after 15 minutes of endless views of gears and digital settings, coupled with gratuitous slapstick...and trying to deduce what anyone's motivation was for their actions (especially, Scorcese's motivations) I pulled the plug on it. Hey, it's not the first bad use of four bucks I've made.It was Scorcese's imprimatur that convinced me to watch it. I did not recognize his touch in any of those fifteen minutes I endured. It appears that he phoned it in and relied on the state-of-the-art digital effects to putty over the obvious flaws. If you hope for intelligent fare, you might want to steer clear but if you are stimulated by Jersey Shore and American Idol and loud glittering things, this will appeal."
1,Pure crap,This movie is boring from start to end. It's one of those movies that tries to be art and maybe it is if your into that kind of thing. Buyer beware!
2,Should have been called A 2 hour movies that makes absolutely no sense,I rented this movies a few nights ago and couldn't even finish it.Nothing about it held my interest. The story takes way to long to get to and even then they hint at it but go off on incredibly pointless side tangents that have nothing to do with the story. The only thing going for it was the camera work. Beautiful set and lighting it would have made for a good movie if it had actually made sense.
1,Half of Hugo!,"I enjoyed the first half of this movie--thought the acting and the atmosphere were verywell done, and being caught up in the mystery I was very upset when halfway through, thedigital picture broke into pieces. I was told this happens when cheap digital copying isdone. Also. I didn't appreciate the long commercials preceding the movie. I still don't knowhow the movie ended--wish I had gone to see it when it was being shown in theaters insteadof buying the DVD."
1,Not much in the way of acting or originality...,"The movie is not original in any way and with acting at an average to below average level, it amazes me that it was considered highly by anyone. Rarely does a movie prove interesting or viewable when the acting and script are poor, certainly the set design and cinematography (and CGI) do not raise the film high enough to be bearable let alone watchable."
2,Beautiful.....but sooooooo boring!,My title says it all. Great direction and beautiful effects but the storyline ( and I use that work loosely) was so pointless and boring. The lame ones always win all the awards. Oh well.
1,HUGO is Slow and Slower,"I realize that Oscar has to give out awards for various classifications. To put it bluntly, HUGO was a Vapid breath of slow stale French air. Don't buy it. Rent it (GAG) at red box or wait till you can download it for free. Slow and slower are the best ways I can describe this movie. It's not a chick flick either. If I were to buy a $12.00 ticket at the local movie theatre, I would walk out of this and sneak into another show. Don't waste your time as life is too short. JJ"
2,Big disappointment,"With all of the Oscar buzz surrounding this film, I decided I had to watch it. What a disappointment! While the film is stunning visually, and I like the homage to early film maker George Melies, the plot and pacing was so slow, I wanted to turn on fast forward.It's ironic that the film is shot of 3D but the characters are really two dimensional. Just not what I expected from this esteemed director."
1,BUMMER,This movie was a total let down. The quality was great but the movie it's self was terrible very slow.
1,I do not know why this movie ranks so high --- it is just vague,"I usually like this sort of film. Granted, it has top-notch actors in it, and the sets and props are dazzling. But the story just never caught my interest. At first it seems like it might be a mystery, then it seems like it might go more into fantasy ...... then all of a sudden we're getting a history lesson on the earliest film industry. They should have picked ONE of these things to try to do --- not all of them. The movie just (pardon the pun) seems to be skipping gears and not running like a well-oiled machine (movie reference).Overall, this may have been an interesting book ....... but it just turns out to be a history lesson wrapped in the promise (unfulfilled) of a fairy tale.If it comes on TV - watch it once, so you can say you've seen it ......... but don't waste your money buying it."
1,Beware of wrong region on Blue Ray discs!,"I expect this would have been very good, except that I learned the hard way that Blue Ray discs from europe and other contenents have a region code different from the US and cannot be played in US players. I saw no such information on the Amazon page I selected it from. In this case the disc came from a seller in England. While they were gracious and offered to refund my $15, it would have cost me $8.00 for postage to ship it back. To avoid this I gave it to a colleague in my office that was on temporary assignment in the US from europe."
2,Nicely filmed but utterly boring...,"I was so disappointed. From it receiving awards to looking promising, this ended up being a boring plot line that really went nowhere and left me wondering why I spent my time watching it. I love stories that make you think and give you insight into life or end up being funny/quirky/interesting. It really held none of these. And if you care about it having Jude Law in it, well...he barely makes an appearance. It held no charm the way an adult's fairy tale should. What a shame. It could have gone so many good ways, and instead fell flat."
2,Two Hour Video Game,"You know a director doesn't have faith in the story, or the acting, when the background music is never ending. On, and on, and on it goes trying to build drama and insight into an empty, visual show 'n' tell with all the depth of a video game."
3,overrated,"With all the rave reviews, we were kind of disappointed after watching it. Interesting but we were all bored. Supposedly awesome ""special effects"" are just the clocks and gears, that's pretty much it."
4,Different kind of movie,This movie was very good. The addition of the robot-like figure in that era was very interesting. I enjoyed the character development.
3,"Great 3D title, but mediocre in 2D.","So this is the best use of 3D I've seen yet in a live-action film. Not that I've seen many, mind you, but I did see the Harold and Kumar 3D movie.That said, it's only mildly entertaining. The story is weird and the only good character is the station guard played by Cohen. The book, on the other hand, seems much better with nice drawings and a creative approach to story-telling.I just think this book should have stayed a book, I guess, but it's nice having an easy-to-watch 3D movie kicking around I suppose. Hopefully some day someone will make a 3D movie worth watching more than once or twice."
4,"Scorsese's gift to his 13-year-old daughter appeals at the adult level, too","Martin Scorsese's 13-year-old daughter asked him why she wasn't allowed to watch any of his movies. So, he created one for her. But this is no mere kid's film. Hidden inside is an ode to the director's true passion: film preservation. That's something that slid right by my nine-year-old nephew. He just thought it was a neat story - he liked the trains, the two young stars, Sasha Baron Cohen's hammy physical comedy, theBrazil-like catacombs in the train station, the clocks and other visual feats. It's a feast for the eyes.Meanwhile, I liked learning about Georges Méliès, seeing Ben Kingsley (a personal favorite) shine, getting a kick out of Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour (co-stars on stage and screen inThe History Boys) in small roles and building up my Scorsese portfolio.And, let's face it, I loved that train station, too. In this master's hands, it's a magical place and a universe unto itself."
3,Mr.,Hugo was a good children's movie. I enjoyed many of the effects but was a little disappointed with the overall story. A worthwhile investment nevertheless.
3,Hugo,"Nice story and very well made movie, entertaining for both adults and kids. My only complaint is that I bought it principally to see a good 3D movie. However, the 3D effect is not nearly as good as one would find in an IMAX 3D movie."
5,Brilliant,This is a brilliant movie that never ceases to hold my interest. It's so beautiful to watch. Thank you Hugo!
5,outstanding family movie,Great movie wonderful cinematography. Would highly recommend. Good story adorable young actors the film moves along and keeps you watching.
5,Awesome movie!,This is an awesome movie with a very good message! Well written and very well directed - it is a most enjoyable show!
4,Great movie experience but not for young kids,"I originaly purchased the movie for my kids, I did not sow it at the movie theathre but from the review it seems like a family film.Not realy it very beatifly made film with great directing and cut but in parts bil slow that would not keep the kids in seat.In my opinio it is not intended for kids 12 years and younger to comprehend the story behind.I was also very pleased with Sasha Baron Cohen performace, it was great suprise from his cultural spof movies. Great support actor for this movie."
4,One of the most wonderful movies I have seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is one of my most favorite movies!!!!! I was a bit disappointed when it didn't arrive in the origional case but rather in a paper sleeve, but that was my fault because I didn't read further comments. But the cd was in good shape just without a hard case to put on the shelf with other movie collection."
3,HUGO 3 D Movie,I was not impressed with the story content. It had nice sound and photography but waas rather disappointed in it.
5,Prompt delivery.,"Very prompt delivery. I am very happy with the purchase, and I was even able to give the regular DVD disk to a neighbor with a buch of kids. They all love it."
2,A nice story with unfulfilled potential,"I didn't like this film because it did not have a climax and had no real point. It was just a slice of the life of this young boy. I continually hoped for some plot twist or excitement, but it just didn't deliver."
2,As if two 50 year old accountantss made a childrens movie.,"What is with those accents. The girl and boy seemed to be from the same universe, but everyone else was from London. It is set in Paris. They could have smoothed everything out to a mid atlantic accent that would have worked for both British and American actors and it would still have been believable simply from the consistency. I somehow had visions of two fifty year old accountants sitting in an office telling each other ""I know what kids like. They like Harry Potter and those damned funny Limey accents. That's what kids like. Just ask me, I know"". This had the smelly hands of a gym and an armored car heist all over it."
4,Hugo VIDEO Review. Making of Scene.,"Length:: 2:12 MinsHugo is one of the best children's films out there, full of fun, light, color, magic, and heart.This short making of video shows the lengths Martin Scorsese - one of cinema's all time great directors, and his talented cast - Asa Butterfield, Chloe Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, and Christopher Lee, went to, to make this film a success.Guest star: James Cameron.Three cheers for Hugo!"
3,An okay movie,"I was very enthusiastic about watching this movie, but at the end it was very disappointing. The visuals is outstanding, but the story itself leaves more to be desire.Pros-beautiful visuals-okay acting-nice endingCons-Way longer than necessary (trust me i can stand watching a movie for 3 hours without a problem, but this story line was prolonged for no reason.)-a bit boring (and i don't get bored easily when watching a movie)-I was expecting something more ""magical"" for me the meaning of the movie is somewhat lost."
4,Wonderful family movie,"Simply wonderful story that all ages can enjoy. One instance, I think, where the story is the star. Even in the hands of a less experienced director, this film would have had life. There is always a place for movies and literature that entwine fiction with real characters."
1,Biggest Waste of Time,"We were so excited to see this movie, only to be utterly dissapointed. After the first 15 minutes of just watching the boy run around his labrynth of clocks inside the train station we should have known then to turn it off and return it. The only thing that was really good about the movie was the background music. It was one of the most boring movies we all had ever seen. We kept expecting something big to happen, a climax to form, but nothing. We didn't even know where the movie was going until the very end. The actors all did an ok job, but they should have put their efforts into a movie that actually meant something. We also felt that this was just a way for the movie makers to feel good about themselves. I thought it a little pathetic. Watch any other movie out there, and I promise you will be better entertained."
1,Utterly disappointing,"I'm a big fan of magical realism but this was pure, Hollywood-processed garbage. This is Scorcese trying to channel Terry Gilliam and flopping miserably. The fact that the academy and most movie goers don't recognize its stink shows just how weak this year's movies were. Some of the worst child-acting since The Phantom Menace."
2,This movie did not live up to the hype.,"I was board out of my mind! I wish i could get my money back.While I loved the actors in the movie, it did not deserve and Oscar nod.I also don't think this is a movie children would like to see."
1,complete waste of time and money,"How a director like SCORSESE can view the final version without cringing is beyond me.....sure the visuals are awesome.....they must have taken about 99 % of the budget as not a cent seems to have been spend on little things like... STORY.....DIALOGUE.....ACTING or anything else that would normaly make an engaging movie.....this is painfully boring and amazingly long.....it seemed like a 6 hour movie when it finally finished.....it could have been a 30 minute visual feast wihtout dialogue or actors...it would have been awesome, but at over 2 hours it is a criminal waste of money and resources"
1,TOO LONG & VERY BORING,"i went to see this movie last week with my younger daughter (16) and to get to the point - it was really terrible. Why it is up for so many awards is beyond me. I guess its the Hollywood cliche working. Anyway it is very slow and very boring.I tried very hard from dozing off and my daughter wanted to leave. We walked out about a little over half the movie. Couldn't take it anymore. Save your time and money, especially with the high cost of movies today."
1,Could not afford an editor,"This movie was extremely slow. They obviously could not afford an editor. Its glacial pace was reminiscent of every awful European movie that you have ever seen. Not only do I want my money back, I want my hours back. I understand it was done originally in 3-D. I doubt that could save this dreadful waste-of-time."
5,It really is a masterpiece ...,And the acting by the two teens is Oscar-worthy. Captivating from beginning to end. Special effects at their best. A+.
4,A good family movie with a good example for your children,I watch and buy alot of movies and was happy with my purchase on this one. I think that it sets a good example for young kids even though the kid is essentially stealing to begin with. My 4 year old was able to grasp the plot and what was going on which is important to me. He has asked to watch it again and makes references to it.
4,A tick to much,"I enjoyed the film but would have enjoyed it even more if there was less of it. I think that the clock ticked a little to long, shorter in areas would have been better for my taste.I still thing it was worth seeing if even a little slow."
1,Buyer Beware,"This is a great movie, but unfortunately many of the sellers are purveying Region B discs which do NOT play in the US on standard blu-ray players. The 3 disc version is probably safe, but the single disc version is most likely not Region A or regionless. When buying from such vendors ask ahead of time what region it specifies because the listings are not specific. If you buy from Amazon, you can return it without paying for postage, but if third party vendors will probably not refund the postage.I can not review the movie further because it will not play."
5,"I lovely story, and beautifully done film","This was a pleasure to watch... You can read reviews all you'd like, but it's well worth watching! Allow yourself the time to really watch it, not just have it on in the background, or while you're doing something else..."
3,"Beautifully filmed, but the story, the emotion?","This was a beautiful movie to look at and magical at times, but in the end it left one flat. While it was touching to regard the inventor of movies receive the acclaim he deserved (or was it, his movies looked a tad silly), it did not seem to be enough of a conflict or problem to inspire an emotional tie. In short, this viewed did not cry at the end, he merely shrugged his shoulders. A decent enough movie, but not great. It certainly does not deserve to be included in the pantheon of great Scorcese films."
5,Just superb,"After reading the book,The Invention of Hugo Cabretmy family was hooked to see the movie. Interestingly the movie also won several Oscars in 2012. The concept of the movie is simple and powerful. I like the way the movie has taken shape. The scenes in the train station, the train moves etc are awesome. It is also gripping and sound effects on a 5:1 surround are spectacular. I watched the Blu ray and not 3D. It is a worthy collection to show off to friends and enjoy with kids."
5,well done,"The acting and storyline aren't my favorite but my son, who has Down Syndrome, is totally in love with this movie."
4,Cue the flying monkeys,"I really enjoyed Hugo. This movie is quirky and VERY slow paced but it is also deliciously stylized and intelligently written. A visually sumptuous, steam-punked homage to the golden age of silent film, the central story line, a child's odyssey of discovery, felt a bit reminiscent of the Wizard of Oz. When well done, and this was, that is a very good thing. Like that classic, this movie would at first seem to be an ideal kid's movie but Hugo's upsetting themes and slow build suggest otherwise."
5,A thoughtful fun film!,The childs point of view was so well maintained that everyone had to think about what was happening and why. Some of the story was totally visual and required thoughtful attention to detail. It was great with a great ending. Perhaps it is too hard for some people.
5,Outstanding film,"This is a truly magical piece of movie-making. Martin Scorsese, his cast, and crew have created something terrific. I saw the film in a cinema when it came out and talked it up among my friends. I wanted my niece and nephew to see it, so I pre-ordered a copy (which was delivered on the first day of the DVD release).I ordered another copy for myself and watched it at home. And I'll be watching it again."
5,Hugo,"I liked this movie very much. I thought it had a good plot line, original, and fun to watch. Good family movie."
4,Well designed film with an interesting story.,Beautifully shot. Very interesting story. Enjoyed it very much. Amazing segments combining digital with live action. It was a lot of fun.
3,Not as expected,"I had heard that this was a ground-breaking, great film. Maybe if I had watched it in 3-D, I would agree. But as a story, it was not very intriguing. I didn't really care what would happen next and the message being sought was not defined well at any point, including the end. Overall, I would call this film contrived. So sorry - I was disappointed."
5,A 3D Masterpiece,"This delightful movie is so visually spectacular that one can easily conclude that it was produced to compliment the latest high resolution 3D technology, and I highly recommend this movie for inclusion in every 3D collection. Prior to viewing this movie, nothing I had seen other than animated movies has displayed anywhere near this level of 3D depth and screen separation, and Hugo seems to have raised the 3D movie bar to whole new level. The 3D effects are not only great, but I found the combination of filming, set design, costumes, and cinematography to be a visually stunning combination, and a total pleasure to view.The intriguing story captures the attention in just the first few seconds, and keeps your eyes glued to the screen right until the very end. Scorsese and Selznick have collaborated to produce a masterful treat for young and old alike, and in my opinion this movie is destined to be a classic."
5,great movie!,"Hugo is a ""feel good"" movie. If you have young children it's a must have, and if you don't, it's a must have for the child still in you. Martin Scorsese is a genius!"
1,"Maybe for a child its great, just watch it on regular DVD...","Not worth the 3d aspect...Also dragged, very boring movie...3D movies so far that have my approval is Journey to the Center Of Earth part 1 and Sanctum...Two movies that will have you excited and immersed in the movies...I havent seen Avatar yet but James Cameron did produce Sanctum, which I heard had you also immersed in movie with the ways the 3D aspects were used."
1,A lot of hype,"This movie was a major disappointment. It never really had much of a plot, it seemed more scattered than anything. The acting was decent except for the little boy playing Hugo. All-in-all this film really failed to hold my attention and I felt myself wondering when it would end. I would not recommend you watch."
1,Boring,"I could not watch the entire 2 hours. I think the filmmakers got lost in the cinematography and forgot that there would be an audience expecting to follow a story. The film takes huge stretches of timeline to show us that Hugo is a lonely orphan that has had an unfortunate life. Then there is an old guy that is uncharacteristically angry. I didn't see the end so I don't know why he was angry but after 90 minutes of ""is something going to happen..."" I really didn't care.This film reminded me of the Accidental Tourist. Another film that drew great praise but bored me to no end.And I'm not an action film junkie, just tell a story without 90% of the time being ""look at the beautiful set we made"" or whatever they were trying to do."
1,"Great film, but you must sit through lots of ads","Great film, but the makers of this force many previews (ads) the cannot be skipped. You should be able to watch a DVD when you want to, not after a bunch of ads. Why do producers of DVDs hate their customers?"
2,Scorsese pays homage to Scorsese yuk Time Waster!!!,"This movie was slow, boring and dull. And the worst part is, all I could hear in the back of my mind was Scor.... saying to himself ""look how great I am"" . The book experience is way better."
2,snore,"Ok, I get that it's arty - it was beautiful. Good color selection, marvelous makeup and costumes to create a world you probably remember from a certain sort of children's book. The actors do a good job creating full characters - Kingsley was particularly good. And I also get that it's a paen to movies and their history. But, sorry - it just doesn't work as a story, or at least not as a movie. I can imagine reading the book this was based on and liking it well enough, but the movie was tedious. It was sort of Tim Burton-esque, so maybe if Nightmare Before Christmas is one of your favorites, you'd like this one too. I found it tiresome in the extreme."
1,Hugo,Terrible picture!!!!!! I recommend this picture to nobody!! Boring!Boring! Boring! The great Scorcese missed the boat on this one!! Hugo is for file 13!!!!
1,Boring,I can't believe any one could watch this movie and be entertained. How could so much money be wasted on such a project? I tried to watch it but so much was cartoonish and you knew exactly where it was going. The characters were not engaging. Perhaps children might like this movie but I was bored to tears.
2,Dull,"I was very disappointed. The movie is very slow leading up to some major revelations, barely keeping me from giving up altogether.And the main subject is about a film maker that was almost forgotten and movie preservation!By the end of the film, I almost feel like I was watching the life-time achievement awardceremony of the Oscars! This is probably a cherished topic for Scorsese, probably reflecting his childhoodmemories, but it does little for me.The Station Inspector character is a major failure. You can tell he is simply not a villain, but then he's nota clown or someone worth sympathies for (considering the children he had sent to the orphanage). As a result, you never feel the kid is in any real danger escaping from him, andthere is just not a lot of tension.Like Isabelle, Hugo's friend, I was looking for an adventure (with an automaton no less!), but didn't find it in this movie."
2,"Promises, Promises!","Visually, the movie is well done. The acting is fine. The plot and dialogue were weakly presented imo. I expected and hoped the movie would live up to the trailer. They seldom do unfortunately. I thought it was weak, but had great potential.I kept forwarding it because it dragged so often. I must learn not to trust trailers!"
2,Too boring to follow,It's not that the story is carried at a slow pace. It's not that the subject is totally uninteresting. It's the underlying trace of pointlessness and lack of connection the movie has that just makes it unbearably boring.Way overrated movie.
3,"Gorgeous movie, but...","One of the most beautiful movies you'll ever see (especially in blu-ray), and I love the concept, but for some reason this movie just never fully engaged me. There are so many things that are right, in concept, about this story, yet it needs a little extra sprinkle of magic. Definitely download or rent, but buy? Eh. 3.5 stars."
2,L-O-N-G and Boring,"Obviously I am in the minority, but I found this movie to be long and boring. The central story was good, but there were a lot of long, drawn out scenes and diversions that didn't add anything to the overall plot. Sasha Baren Cohen was funny, but it wasn't necessarily a funny movie. It was just sad. The cinematography was wonderful however."
2,not that great,"This was recommended to us as a great movie, but we were disappointed. The 3D aspect didn't add or distract from the movie, it was the story line that was disappointing."
2,Expected more,"For being an award winning film I expected a lot more, so maybe that's why I was disappointed in the movie. Glad I didn't fork out the dollars see ""Hugo"" in the theater. The set seemed dark and depressing and the the story-line was slow. This quote best sums it up for me ""I would have been more forgiving if the trailer was more accurate instead of making the film look like it was a magical sci-fi or something MORE than what it actually was."""
2,"read the book, skip the movie","Watched this movie because I enjoyed the book (basically a graphic novel) VERY much. The movie is overly long, boring and tedious. Scorsese playing Spielberg."
3,Looks great but somewhat dull,"The actors all do a good job and the production design is beautiful, as are the recreations and uses of very old film footage from the earliest days of cinema.Somehow, though, this is not all that entertaining. Something about it just doesn't work, at least not consistently."
3,Major Ghosting Marred What Could Have Been a Stellar Release,"Some scenes of this 3D Blu Ray release are incredible, but typically followed by a horribly ghosted scenes that makes you go cross-eyed!I was able to make adjustments from scene-to-scene, something the customer shouldn't have to do if encoded properly.Clearly the folks at Paramount are inept at this, or more likely, just don't care.For a movie over 2 hours, any visual disruption only adds to the fatigue of having to sit through it.By right, Paramount released a faulty product on this and only a product recall would be in order. But it's Paramount, so they'll release a re-code years from now at an additional cost to us if we actually want to re-purchase this film.p.s. it's not just me, several sites have reviewed this and agree."
2,This one lost on me. Glad I did not spend money in theater on this.,"Curious because Academy Awards nominated for best picture. Well after viewing still curious what all the fuss was, is about. Oh, being an engineer, I loved all the clockworks, gears, special effects BUT not worth the price of admission, i.e. watching this slow, prodding film. Do not recommend."
1,"Silly, self-absorbed, dull nonsense","My daughter and I read the book and thought the pictures were wonderful, but the story was dull. The book's ending was so absurd that I thought the movie must have a different ending since it was receiving such good reviews. Wrong! The movie is as silly as the book plus some. Ben Kingsley's character, George Melies, is distraught when, after the first world war, his films are no longer popular among returning soldiers who have witnessed the horrors of war. Does this realization cause him to gain perspective on life or make new films to appeal to this more sophisticated/hardened audience? No. It turns him into a depressed bully who spends decades lamenting his lack of popularity until he's rediscovered and appreciated. Instead of sympathy for the orphaned boy, it's all about what each of the characters can do to boost Melies' self-esteem. It was also overly long with some seemingly pointless scenes, and overall was slow-paced despite the melodrama."
1,Book was better than the movie,This overhyped movie production doesn't have anything on the book version of the story. It was actually more entertaining to read this bookThe Invention of Hugo Cabretthan to watch that movie.
1,Boring movie,"I tried to watch this movie a couple of times, very little narrative and boring. The set designs are outstanding but the movie cannot hold my attention."
3,Solid production quality. Story felt anemic.,Enjoyable movie. Good cast and solid production quality. Worth a watch if you are looking for a good film to wind down the day with but nothing that will blow your socks off.
4,Hugo,My 8 and 11 year old grandsons really liked this movie. The 8 year old had read the book but the older grandson had not read it. I read the book and liked it better than the movie. The movie was beautifully made but it did not follow the book as closely as I would have liked. Also there is no way to know if the digital copy has already been downloaded. That would be very helpful infomation when a person buys a used Blue Ray/ digital movie.
4,Different movie,"The way Hugo deals with Melies is enchanting in itself, but the film's first half is devoted to the escapades of its young hero. In the way the film uses CGI and other techniques to create the train station and the city, the movie is breathtaking."
4,HUGO,"I REALLY LIKED THIS MOVIE, IT TOOK A WHILE TO FOLLOW THE STORY LINE, HOWEVER AT THE END OF THE MOVIEEVERYTHING CAME TOGETHER AND COMPLETED A GOOD STORY."
3,Takes too long to get into the story line,"A really good movie but takes too long to get into the story line. Too many scenes without dialog or action. It takes over a hour to get into the real story line. The actors were great, the history of the silent films was wonderful. The last hour of the film was well worth watching the movie for. The special effects were splendid."
3,"Nice special Effects, but...","The film is pleasing to the eye with all the great special effects, but is way too long and did not even pull me in to the underlying ""Coming of Age"" love romance story of the young couple."
5,Story included in The Chronicles of Pern: First Fall,"Unless I am mistaken, this is the same story included in The Chronicles of Pern: First Fall. I read that book and thoroughly enjoyed it. I highly recommend it!"
2,Disappointing,"Anne McCaffrey stumbles in this mini-story about dolphins helping evacuate the original landing site on Pern after the disastrous eruption of Mt. Garben. This is really a story-fragment, not a full-fledged novella. Unlike -Nerilka's Story-, which *was* a separate novel about the lady who sooths the heartbreak of Moreta's main squeeze, -The Dolphin's Bell- requires that 1 read -Dragondawn- to understand who each character is, & why we should give a damn. This is information that simply is *not* given - &, consequently, we don't.Don't read this unless you've got -Dragonsdawn- & the time to check out who's who."
5,Read this book,This is a great book combining 2 of my favorite things dolphins and Pern. This is a very good book. I couldn't put it down.
5,Hands down one of his best!,"I've been on a tear of P.J. O'Rourke's books lately, starting with Republican Party Reptile and so forth. This is by far one of P.J.'s best. I'm on the other side of the coin politically (fairly liberal) myself, but P.J. usually spares no one, and I admire that (Rush and his wacko friends could learn a thing or two).This book is just about how to get by if you're a bachelor. It's incredibly funny for the most part (the cooking sections should not be read if you've just ate!). This is a fantastic little book, very helpful if you plan to live like a slob or like a typical college freshman."
1,The author should be fined; the editor should be fired.,"I was trying to decide whether I should buy this book for my 21-year-old step-son who lives alone, and so so took a ""look inside."" I saw that the author used ""then"" when he should have used ""than"" in a comparative sentence. If the author and the editor cannot edit any better THAN that, THEN I will not spend my money on this book.FYI: here is the offending sentence from the first chapter: ""Any item of clothes or bedding that has to be dry-cleaned more often then you commit a cardinal sin in it should be thrown away."""
4,Scathingly Funny,"Although Mr. O'Roarke usually writes from a conservative perspective, this book can be read by anyone. The pictures are even funnier than the text. The only complaint I had was that it was too short."
3,wasn't 100% happy,"So when you first click the picture it's the VIXEN WOMEN""S SEXY PIRATE COSTUME. Then suddenly the link changes to SWASHBUCKLER SEXY PIRATE. I didn't figure this out until after I got my item. It sucked because I had already bought all my accessories for the other costume, & to tell the truth, this black one i got wasn't the same as the red one AT ALL. When I got the black one I was okay..until I tried it on..then I had to go buy a tutu thing to go underneath for 30$ at a halloween store..then the hat costed 30$ also..so that really sucked. I thought I'd be saving by buying this one but I ended up spending 40$ more than if I just bought the VIXEN pirate in the store."
5,Best membrane reference book out there,"I've been in the Membrane business for over 20 years and seen both from an academic/research side to the inustrial/business side. This book is a ""must"" for all membranologists. It is a screening test all new membrane ideas must pass. It is a must for all marketing/sales types who want to look at market potential. It is a must for all scientists who simply enjoy understanding things."
3,Various Artists - not the original,"As with the prevous review, I was very disappointed with this CD. I put this CD in my player and was alittle shocked that these were not the original artists. Why wasn't this advertised on the CD or in the Amazon.com product discription? In any case, the music isn't that bad. I just don't believe that this CD was properly marketed."
5,Great Film,"I love the books, I love the Swedish movie version and I love this version. Each has their own things that set it apart from each other. What's not to love about more Lisbeth. I think David Fincher did an excellent job with this film. I also loved the packaging for the DVD which some seems to complain about."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"So much violence and sexual violence at that. I'm sure it adds to the story, but I can't stand to watch it. Without it, I enjoyed the suspensefulness of the movie and the crime solving. Interesting story."
3,"Very enjoyable thriller, 3.5 stars to be specific","Some areas were overly dramatized; other than that, it was a very well produced show.The villain actually played a similar, creepy role in at least one movie that had to do with a young girl. It does not deserve four stars in my book due to its too Hollywood style, predictable ending of the thriller part--problems get solved, bad guys get caught, etc. But the ending of the movie itself was very nice, almost gives one the taste of enjoying a short story. The female character was quite charming in her brutal honesty, and dark integrity. You will like it, --it's better than many junks we get on this side of the Atlantic.Again, the phrase ""dark integrity"" (my coinage, :-)) comes to my mind when I think of the girl with the dragon tattoo."
2,Caution:UltraViolet Bluray digital copy,"The movie is a great portrayal of a very compelling story by Stieg Larsson.However, this format of a digital copy is currently not worth the money, time and effort. I was instructed to open an account with UltraViolet. I have an Ultraviolet digital copy of another movie which I was instructed to download with Flixster. Apparently I should have used the same account name for each, now I have to use Flixster for one movie and UltraViolet for the other. Can't merge them. System is too fussy. A single download to iTunes allows me to easily access digital copies from all of my devices. Hopefully the UltraViolet System will oneday be worthwhile."
5,Solid Package,"As an avid David Fincher fan, I'm pleased with my purchased. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has become a classic among my blu-ray collection. I enjoyed the dark tone of the film as well as the acting, specifically Roony Mara (Lisbeth). Having previously watched it online, I looked to purchase the Blu-ray/DVD combo, which I found for a good deal on Amazon. The video and audio on the transfer are outstanding, it's definitely worth spending more for the blu-ray. I did have an issue downloading the UltraViolet digital copy but eventually got it working. Highly recommended if you find it on sale."
4,I like em all,I won't compare this to the Swedish subtitled versions because I think they are all good. I have read the whole series and then watched the swedish subtitled version. Then I watched the American version (This one). Then I went back and watched the 6 part swedish extened version with sub titles. The story is exceptional and maybe because I had read the books even better. I would reccomend reading or listening to the books first so you get all the details the first time through. All three episodes are available in audio books and swedish subtitled video.
4,girl with the dragon tatoo,"the movie was very good, but I found the Swedish vergin to be even better. some things were left out of the English movie"
2,Brutal and Dark,"Dark, brutal, strange. You have to wonder what the author experienced or has warped day dreams about. Why am I being forced to write 20 words about something. That is silly."
1,"Sent swedish version, bate and switch!","Sent swedish version instead of what they claimed to be as shown. David Fincher is a great movie maker, but thats not what i got!"
3,Big Disappointment...,"OK, I didn't read the book. Now that that's out of the way, and without eight paragraphs of text to impress ya'll about how movie smart I am and analyzing every character and performance to death... Hollywood should stay out of this game. Do yourself a BIG favor and go watch the ""real deal"". For pure entertainment value, you cannot beat the Swede's on this one. Go stream ""Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition"" on N&$F#@X to see it all."
1,These producers think Americans are dumb,"I watched this movie with my husband after I had already seen the original Swedish version with subtitles. The American version is so dumbed down from the original it is insulting. Everything is spelled out as if the viewer couldn't possibly make simple connections about what is happening without being told exactly what is happening. The characters in this film don't even seem to have the same depth or likability. If you're not sure which one to watch, I highly recommend the original Swedish film."
4,The best version I think,"It is a murder mystery film, however it is also about the two main characters and their interactions and working together to solve a murder, or series of murders. I do not want to give anything away as the story and how it unfolds is what makes the movie run so well. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the US version is quite long. However it is a movie which you rather it not end due to the entertaining characters and the intense visual situations which you wish to look away from, but you can't.My opinion Its the best one of the lot."
5,Best movie of the year,"The soundtrack is unique, the plot is exciting, the suspense is palpable, the acting is great. David Fincher really nailed it with this work. I'm surprised it did so poorly at the box office."
2,BE CAREFUL,"I ordered this disc for my parents. When they received it, the first thing they noticed was the non traditional DVD sleeve. Then they opened it up and it was written on with a marker like you would your photo discs or something like that. When they began watching it, it was very dark and they couldn't hardly understand the dialogue. They said it looked like someone was sitting in a movie theater and filmed it and slapped it on the DVD. What disappointed me is that it was shipped direct from Amazon! This certainly isn't the quality that I have been used to all these years. I contacted them this morning and told them I think that they were duped. I'm writing this in hopes that the customers will be careful when purchasing this item. Mine might have been a fluke, but I just wanted the information to be on here just in case it involves more than just my copy."
1,Badly done and not needed to be done,"Three major defects to the movie. The sound was not properly recorded to the movie. Going twenty to thirty levels per scene and a lot of the sound was muffled and distorted. Which I think was an affect, but! Second, the film is really NOT film noire and the use of black and shadows did NOT enhance anything. In fact I would term parts of the movie as being designed for the blind. Third and importantly, the movie has sexual perversions which do NOT really help the film. Personally, I think the film deserves a black listings along with the actors and crew. De Sade lives on in this jerk flick. Stripping the defects the script and camera work really was super-sub parr! Thanks, Harry."
1,Looks like a Bootlegged DVD,"I purchased this DVD as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She opened the DVD and found what looked like a bootlegged DVD. The DVD was packaged as though it was new, but the folded case that the DVD was held in appeared to be slightly worn. I have decided to return the DVD."
3,Why? Why when the Swedish version dubbed was already available???,"Watched all 3 Swedish ""Girl"" dubbed English and liked the series very much. Rented the American version out of curiousity. What?? Why was this film made?? If you want ""Girl"", do the Swedish version and skip this. Did not like tinkering done with end of this one either. Not recommended. Get the Swedish version."
3,Shocked,"I received ""The Girl with Dragon Tatttoo"" today. I was shocked to see that the title on the DVD looked liked it had been put on with a Black Sharpie???! I paid $19.99 for a new DVD -- is this DVD legal! The package it arrived in looked legitimate and the movie played well."
1,Movie Great - Boycott UltraViolet Products,"I bought this after seeing it at the theaters, but want people about buying any UltraViolet products. This is no way provides a digital copy that can be used offline. Let alone, you have to register with all of these different companies keep track of your sign-in and password just to watch something that you have already paid for. Buying a digital copy with a blu-ray/DVD should be buying a disc that you can insert and upload to your device to watch later when not connected. Therefore, BOYCOTT ALL ULTRAVIOLET PRODUCTS."
1,waste of time and money.,"As with any book produced into a movie, it's hard to capture the whole story with full detail. In my opinion they missed the mark with this one. The movie follows the book to the T, but if I hadn't read the book i would have been lost in the movie. The actors mumble a lot, so it's hard to follow the dialogue. The scenes jump so quickly from on to the next, once you do figure out what's going on they have already moved on two scenes. I suggest you save your money and read another book."
2,Why Did They Even Bother to Make This Movie?,"After sitting for over two hours trying hard to have an open mind, I just ended asking myself ""Why did Hollywood even bother making this movie?"". ""Were they trying to prove that Hollywood could do it better than Swedish Cinema?"". ""Did they want to reach the audience that simply refuses to read subtitles?"".If they wanted to make an Americanized version, they should have at least changed the story and characters to take place in the US of A. The Swedish ""accents"" were annoying and everything felt out of place.Yes, I know I feel this way because I watched the original trilogy first, and I would probably feel the same if I watched an Italian version of ""Gone with the Wind"", it just would not feel right. (With all due respect to Italian Cinema, one of my favorites).If you liked this version and have not watched the original Swedish version, I recommend that you do, then judge for yourself."
1,This is not region free,"This 3 disk pack is advertised for all regions, but in fact only Region A is supported. Suggest that you purchase from Amazon UK when it if you are from Europe or Australasia."
1,looks fake- pathetic,got my DVD.. the case is made out of cheap cardboard and the DVD looks fake. basically looks like someone burned and and sold it for $18. the title on the DVD looks like it was written in magic marker. pathetic. 1st time buying a DVD from amazon and the last time. what a shame.
1,Not a review of the movie but of Ultraviolet,"I just wanted to add my frustration regarding the ""digital copy"" aspect associated with this package. I purchased with the belief that a digital copy would mean that I could download and use on my portable device. That is not the case at all. The only download capability is to your computer. I agree with the other reviewer. I should have purchased the HD version from iTunes. It is $2 cheaper and I could play everywhere.The movie by the way is very good and I would rate it 5 stars."
1,This was a pirated video that we received!!!,We opened the package to find a pirated video. It was a Sony DVD with Sharpie Marker writing. I am very upset being that this was a gift!! How embarrassing.
1,Was not a copied disc not an original factory disc,"When I purchase a product, I want a factory product not a copy. This had what looked like original packaging but a boot leg product."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. POOR SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY! THE NAME OF THE MOVIE WAS WRITTEN IN MARKER ON THE DISC. NOT AN AUTHENTIC COPY.
1,save your money ! !,"This movie is really POOR... They do not much follow the plot, had you not read the book you would have no idea what was going on, poor photography, poor acting. Buy the Swedish version with English subtitles..."
3,Ehh..,"This isn't in any way bad, its just not as good as i thought it'd be. Being a fan of the first 2 of the Swedish films (havent yet seen the 3rd) and a fan of Fincher's films and Daniel Crag as an actor i expected much more from this. Craig is of course great in the film, but Rooney Mara as Lisbeth doesn't seem like she was that Into the role at times. I found myself thinking certain scenes weren't up to par or as powerful as in the Swedish film, for instance: when Lisbeth is mugged near the beginning there is no sense of Danger at all involved, its just a Simple bag snatching scene with Her yelling distortedly at the single mugger. And another example would be at the end where the Car explodes. It really isn't as powerful or deep compaired to the Swedish version. And the same goes for the flashbacks. As i stated, the film isn't bad at all - i just feel Fincher could've done much more with the story. Hopefully the next one is better. Somewhat a disappointment in said areas. 3 stars."
3,What was wrong!,"I found the mood music totally irritating. To me, it sounded like a diesel engine with sloppy valves. To have this on top of voices is unbearable. I though my sound system had gone bonkers because I could not understand the voices. Then I realized they were attempting a Swedish accent. On top of that, it was dark, I suppose for effect. Don't know what to think of Rooney Mara. They did a terrible makeup job on her, more like a Vampire chic. I preferred the ""don't mess with me vision of Noomi Rapace"". One must look at the face of Noomi, one can not avoid it. She acts more with her eyes and her mouth than with words. One does not have to look at Rooney more than once or twice. Rooney does have a nice girlish body that does not fit the discription of the book's Salander. After all that, it is an good adaption of the book. I am just not a fan of Fincher. Think Alien 3."
2,Get the Swedish Version,"I don't know if watching the Swedish version first ruined this movie for me, but something did. The female lead, Rooney Mara, didn't stand a chance in reinterpreting Noomi Rapace's version of Lisbeth Salander. Noomi Rapace IS Lisbeth Salander. Daniel Craig was adequate but Michael Nyqvist owned the male lead character as well. The Swedish version is rawer, grittier, and the tense mood is retained throughout the movie. I don't know if it was just my connection but I also had trouble hearing some of the mumbled dialog in the American version. Maybe it was just me. I felt like I needed subtitles for this version too. If you get the chance, check out some of the Swedish films. Sometimes I think Hollywood has a lot to learn. I see lots of foreign films for $7.95/mo on N$tflix."
3,Girl with the dragon tattoo,"Pretty good movie, good story line. There are some scenes that were pretty bad so just fast forwarded through them. I did like the acting so all in all I would give it 3 stars."
3,Book,"Book review, hard time getting into the story but good once past a few chapters. I found the video(DVD) helpful after I watched it."
5,Amazing!,"I heard about this movie but until I watched it (for the first time), I had no idea just how absorbing it was. It kept me sitting on the edge of my seat throughout the entire showing and I was never disappointed. In fact, I’ve watched it numerous times and I always saw little things I missed the first time. FABULOUS MOVIE! They were the perfect actors for the parts. I bought another DVD just in case I wear out the first one. I just can't wait to see the sequels of the trilogy."
1,Bootleg copy,"I have had nothing but trouble with my order for this movie...first I received the wrong movie..I ordered the version with Daniel Craig and was sent the Swedish version. When I called your customer service I was told the correct movie would be sent out (over nighted) at no cost to me..and a return label would be e-mailed to me right away..the next day..no return label and no movie...I called again and the person I talked to told me the distributor had noted not to send the return label as it was just the packaging was incorrect, and the movie was the right one...NOT SO. Received the return label and yesterday received the movie.. opened it this morning and the packaging is correct but the movie is a boot leg..it is copied on a Sony DVD-R disk and the title is hand written on the disk."
1,DVD-R COPY WTF,Just recieved my copy and it is a dvd-r copy of this movie. I should send this to the FBI for illegal downloading. Not happy at all
1,looks fake- pathetic,"got my DVD.the case is made out of cheap cardboard and the DVD looks fake. basically looks like someone burned and and sold it for $18. the title on the DVD looks like it was written in magic marker. pathetic. 1st time buying a DVD from amazon and the last time. what a shame. I could have made this for $5. Amazon, you are pathetic."
1,Kindle Special Offer,"Redeem your ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" Kindle Special Offer at Amazon.com by 4/24/2012 and get 50% off another mystery film.Is this an Oxymoron or what?If you're read anything about the UltraViolet Digital Copy system, you will know it is useless on your portable device unless it is Wi-Fi connected....try that on most planes, a road trip, or camping.This movie is OK, so was the Swedish version, but my advice is read the book if you want the real story, and in-depth character development. I could not put the book down; the movie would be hard to follow if you haven't read the book."
1,Horrible,"Boring, way too long and too much stuff that doesn't add to the story at all. What a waste of time"
1,The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"The packaging for this item was very poorly made. The case was cardboard. The disc appears to have had the title written on it with a permanent marker. There were no previews for other movies on this disc, just the movie that was ordered. The movie description on the back of the case is just a piece of paper glued on the back of the case. It has strong resemblances of a bootleg disc."
4,"Solidly done, but.....","A man who works as a journalist is asked to investigate the disappearance of a woman in the 60's. He teams with Lisbeth Salander, a woman who, let's just say, is very unique. She is a computer hacker who early on in the film takes revenge on a man who brutally rapes her. The two are working together to solve the mystery of Harriet, who mysteriously vanished years ago. The film is technically outstanding, well-acted, and it maintains the realism and brutality of the rape and revenge scenes involving Lisbeth Salander. Unfortunately, the movie is overlong due to an unnecessary revenge sequence involving a businessman that the journalist had been convicted of libeling. With David Fincher at the helm, I expected a great film, but what I saw was merely a good one."
3,Just a Little Off,"A decent move, but I found that it was a little off...not just from the book, but just a little off from being a great movie.If you haven't read the book and you are torn between the book and the movie, run to the book....do it. Then, once you have read the book, you can watch the movie.Overall, I would give the movie a 70/100."
2,Dragon Tatto (U.S. Movie Version),"This appeared to be a ""copy"" or pirated version of the authorized movie. Not sure I'm comfortable with this purchase.However, I also purchased ""Dragon Tatoo TRILOGY"" Extended Edition which contains 4 DVDs of the Swedish Series. This is a MUCH BETTER PURCHASE then the American version starring Daniel Craig. In fact, they should have released this Series in American theatres! Even though the Series is ""dubbed"" in English, you would almost never detect it, as the dubbing is excellently veiled."
2,Book is Way Better,"This movie did not do the book justice at all. Daniel Craig made Bloomkvist seem comedic and unbelievable. Why would he walk back into the serial killer's house at the end of the movie, after he had already escaped. Stupid."
2,Received a pirated version of this DVD,"I was really disappointed when I received this DVD. It wasn't the original version, it was a pirated disc in the case. I've ordered a lot of things from amazon over the years and never had any problems until now. And I'm pretty sure that pirating DVD's is illegal."
4,"Wonderfully acted, suspenseful, violence more graphic than necessary!","Roony Mara was superb! When she was onscreen, you noticed no one else. Daniel Craig is so much better as Mikael Blomkvist than as James Bond. He was perfect. The story seemed a little choppy at times, the way it see-sawed back & forth. Could have flowed better, but I liked it. While I understand the sexual violence was necessary to the plot & story, it was overdone. The director must have been trying to shock us, but remember nothing shocks viewers these days!We can certainly get the picture without having to actually see every gory detail!"
4,Reel Deal DVD?,"I ordered and received the movie, ""The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo"" and watched over the weekend. However, I noticed a few scenes in the movie were either ""edited"" or simply ""cut"" . I am asking AMAZON to kindly advise if this was the ""original"" theatre version ordered. If not, then this particular version has certainly been edited or someone tampered with the movie and deleted scenes from it.Please let me know your thoughts. Yes, I saw the movie in its entirety and scenes were missing.Thank you,Denise Torres-Vazquez"
4,Very Good,"this movie had the typical David Fincher look--kind of dark and dreary(hope spelling is right..-oh well). The acting was great, particularly the girl with the dragon tattoo. She wins you over very quickly"
4,"A page turner, but this book will not change your life.","I waited for the hype to die down before reading. I still don't fully understand it. Sometimes the writing is really choppy and factual without being relevant, like ""Lisbeth spent 5000 krona at the 7-11 before going home"" (I'm making that up, but it's not far off) which can be irritating. Also, if this is so women-kick-butt, ladies to the rescue, then why is Lisbeth referred to as a ""girl"" throughout this entire book? Is not 25 old enough to be considered a grown a** woman?"
3,"the cast did a very good job. daniel craig was very good, rooney mara was excelent . BUT, hollywood did it's usual hatchet job","the cast did a very good job. daniel craig was very good, rooney mara was excelent, BUT hollywood did it's usual hatchet job on this movie. i read the book, have the swedish movie of all three books. they were far better than hollywoods try."
3,Changes,There are some changes that the American version made that don't make the film as powerful as the foreign version is. The characters have changed and some of the motivations too. There is a small romance thrown in that the foreign version does not have. I have not read the series so I cannot say as to how well either did in keeping faithful to them. It is still a good story but I would recommend that you watch the foreign series it is better.
5,Great movie-Rooney Mara is fantastic as the girl with the Dragon Tatoo,The movie is very entertaining and Rooney Mara's performance will make her a star in the near future. I loved how she changed into the beautiful blond in the ending.
5,Excellent!,This is an excellent adaptation of the book. I was engrossed from the start. I had my doubts about Daniel Craig because I am so used to thinking of him as 007. He is great and Rooney Mara is fantastic as Salander.
5,Great Movie,This movie is awesome. A must get on blue-ray. I can't wait till the rest of this series comes out.
2,Hyped but barely readable,"I have often thought that, yes, popular books may not always share the finest literary styles, devices, or elegance, and may lack in character depth, in thematic development, in intellectual interest--but would fulfill reader expectations of pacing, of suspense, of interest. Well, judging from this volume, apparently they needn't fulfill such expectations either. I got to page 50 or so and then let myself stop reading."
1,Disappointed,"This is the second BluRay of this title that you sent. Both Blu Ray disc are unplayable in Australia. This is despite Blu Ray being region free. I tried the dvd in three different BluRay players, all with the same resulting message...that the player and disc were incompatable.Even the normal dvd qaulity was not good, with the dvd sticking on a couple of occasions.I will not buy BluRay from you again"
1,"Don't waste your time, watch the original","This is a poor remake of a good film. The american adaptation is a poor quality copy, instead of a unique interpretation. The thing I really enjoyed about the Swedish version aside from the great job of casting, acting and good story is the silence or space in the dialog. Just like some music, the space in between the notes is what makes it great, it's the same here with the dialog. The Swedish director uses the space in the dialog to great impact. The american version has no space between..."
1,The anatomy of a remake.,"This film is a disaster. I kept waiting for it to bait me but it never did. The film moved along to fast.I still prefer the Swedish version of this movie. It creeps up on you slowly and uncoils like a snake. It had that ""Ah Hah"" moment that I did not get from the American Version.I just wanted to remove the disc from DVD player and watch the Swedish version again....I thought Rooney Mara was horrible as Salander(And everyone has their own opinion). The locations were nice in this film. As they were in the Swedish version also.And I have read the books. I have enjoyed all three. And I also understand that the American movie version is closer to the book. But I still would recommend for folks to watch the Swedish version of this movie........"
4,Well Done,"Without having read the books nor having seen the Swedish versions of the story, I found this movie very intriguing and complex with dozens of characters to keep track of. Rooney Mara who plays the female lead role is very believable and steals the show from Daniel Craig. The dialogue is well written, but sometimes the actors mumble, so be prepared with the rewind button.PLOT:A journalist (Daniel Craig) is hired by a wealthy businessman to investigate the disappearance of the man's niece forty years ago under the pretense of writing his biography. As the case unfolds, he decides to enlist the aid of a computer hacker (Rooney Mara) to assist in gathering more information.WARNING: contains scenes/themes of rape, incest, torture, homosexuality, and consensual sex. I fast forwarded through several disturbing scenes, because it's easy to get the gist without having to sit through it."
2,Great movie but this product is horrible,"The movie was all around very well done and is not the reason this product got only 2 stars, if it was JUST the movie itself I would have given it 4 or 5. The fact that this only comes with an ""Ultraviolet Digital"" copy instead of a fully usable, real digital copy is why I gave it 2 stars. I like to take my movies with me on my iPad or laptop (which doesn't have a BD drive) and when I'm on the road I don't have wifi access so I can't stream the UV copy with out using all 5gb of my data plan. So without a legitimate downloadable digital copy this version of the movie should be at least $10 cheaper since you can only watch the UV copy where you have wireless internet."
2,THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO,I HAD READ THE BOOKS THEY WERE VERY GOOD. I BOUGHT THE VIDEO TO SEE WHY THE MOVIE DID NOT DO AS WELL AS THE BOOKS.THEY LEFT OUT SOME OF THE MOST DRAMATIC SCENES AND INFORMATION THAT GIVE THE BACK GROUND OF MADE LIZBETHLIKE SHE IS.
2,slightly disappointed,"I bought this as a gift for my grandfather. It said it was facctory sealed but the dvd was a burned dvd with a hand written title on it. Kinda disappointed about that. Still played though, that was a relief"
2,"Good movie, but not great digital version","Really enjoy the movie, however beware if you are purchasing for the digital version. I have had nothing but issues and have learned that it is not compatible with an iPhone / iPad / iTouch. Perhaps this is common knowledge, but after several emails with customer service with Sony, I unfortunately am going to end up purchasing a digital copy of movie again."
2,English version a total disappointment,"I don't want to say that the movie was horrible, BUT it was dump down. I'm not crazy about the violent scenes from the original movie, but it delivered a very strong message about the main character. Also, this english version had to go back and give you flashes reminding you of things and over explained things that were best left to the imagination. In addition it just extended a non existent relationship between the characters that, to me changed the flavor of the movie and the essence of the characters. This one draaaaaged..... The original movie, now that one is a GOOD movie! [...]"
3,Lousy adaption of a great story.,I've seen both the Swedish version and this American version. I've read the entire trilogy.I'm not a fan of subtitles but even with that handicap the Swedish version was far better. The acting in this version was very good but the script was bastardized in many places. The director and his ego obviously thought his story was better than the original. He was very wrong. If his version was a book it probably wouldn't have done as well as the original. Watch it for the acting but be prepared to be disappointed if you've already read the book.. Watch the Swedish version for the acting and the story as it follows the book very well and you won't be disappointed.
3,Movie great- product pilfered,I ordered this movie having seen it in the theater and wanted a copy to watch at home. I like the additional features and additional picture quality of Blu-Ray. The one disappoinment was that the third disk in the case was a DVD copy of the movie however someone apparently pilfered the OEM version and put a copied DVD-R disk with a handwritten label in the case. This must have been a returned product but sold to me as new. I did not return it since I really just wanted the Blu-Ray copy and didn't want the hassle. I would expect someone in the Amazon shipping centers to pay more attention to the product before they put it in my box especially if it had been returned. :(
3,"Slow at first, then jarring, and then good.","This movie was not for me. I do not have an issue watching violent movies, but this one was too much for me. I didn't think that was possible. It is very slow moving for the first 45 minutes or so, and then it vamps up. I've heard that the books are great, but I'm afraid this movie made it where I don't want to read them no matter how good they are. The actors were great, and the story was interesting, but like I said, it was just way too much for me. Even my husband didn't like it, which is odd."
4,Solid Adaptation,"I just wish this adaptation were as magical as the Swedish film..................there are aspects of Fincher's I prefer: the ending, the cat, the supporting cast, and some of the locations..................the 2 leads are really better in the Swedish film and why Fincher does not give Lisbeth the choice of saving Martin was puzzling to say the least. All in all I really enjoyed this film; Fincher is one of the best directors working today..................you cannot make a Zodiac or Fight Club every time out, but this is a solid thriller."
1,Not my cup of tea.,"There was something about the show that kept me watching, although I can't say I really liked it. I have not read anyof the books in this series."
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL COPY,"THIS DVD IS A BOOTLEG COPY, THIS IS NOT... THE ORIGINAL I PAID FOR !!!! I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT I DID NOT GET WHAT I PAID FOR !!!"
1,UltraViolet limits this release,"Why not include an option for either an iTunes download or the UltraViolet service, and the consumer can choose which they prefer?"
1,Ultra Violet Garbage,"Like the reviewers said above, UltraViolet is garbage. This is streaming, not a true digital copy. Is it so hard just to give us an Itunes code?"
5,I really liked this movie!,"This item arrived quickly in good condition. The movie keeps you interested all the way through. It is rather violent, however it relates well to the books."
1,Did not enjoy this movie at all,Did not enjoy this movie. It could have been a good movie if there was not so much focus on sexual content. Will not suggest this movie to anyone.
4,Another recommended movies,A friend who read the series and saw this movie recommended it. I really loved it except for two scenes that were quite horrible. Other than that I really enjoyed the story and the actors. It was quite good.
5,Love it,Great movie. worth every penny. The dramatic scenes and the edgy sex scene with full nudity are odd in today's theatrical society. Fincher nails the essence of the book.
4,Good Movie - Mostly follows the book.,I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was helpful to have read the book first simply because it helped with keeping up with with the story line. The movie was fairly true to the book. There were some differences but I did not think those interfered with the main plot of the book. Enjoyed the actors in the movie - I thought they did a good job with their characters. The price was reasonable for the download video...
4,good modern flick,Pay attention! and then pay attention some more. A good film with a great cast. Rooney mara is awesome and i can't wait to see her in future films.
5,Excellent remake,I was pleasantly surprised with how this was directed and acted. Engrossing. I'd say 4.5 stars. But I'll go up In this case.
4,Not disappointing,"I wasn't so sure about this movie, having seen the original trilogy, which I think is outstanding. I'm not too big of a fan of remakes, often finding them disappointing knockoffs.That isn't the case here. The story is riveting, with Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) dominating every scene, and rightly so. Her character is connected to the mystery being solved, and the retribution that's dished out.Daniel Craig did a good job with his character, and took the appropriate 2nd seat to Lisbeth.This movie holds its own, and is no knockoff.It's not disappointing at all."
3,"Trite, Formulaic Story Saved by Terrific Acting","One really must try hard to suspend disbelief with this film. A mega-rich Swedish family with a tradition of serial murder and their very own basement torture chamber? Really? And a 23-year-old Goth druggie who has somehow learned a stunning array of investigative and banking skills that even the most seasoned cop wouldn't command? Uh...no. Basically, the story arc is ridiculous.But Daniel Craig does a fine job and Rooney Mara is riveting. She takes one of the most unbelievable characters ever written and makes it her own. And, by the way, hats off to Robin Wright, who has aged beautifully and doesn't, unlike Julia Roberts, desperately try to disguise it.I could have totally done without the anal rape scene, however. Was there a point to that?"
4,Even for Hollywood its pretty good!!!!,"Great movie, not as good as the books but still great!!! The guy in the swedish version is much more like the Mikeal I had in my head!! Still can't complain with Daniel Craig ;-)"
3,Didn't really care for the movies...,The books are better & even those are just ok. Love the insights into Swedish culture so that's a plus...
1,A copy NOT an original,I had ordered this movie with the expectation that is was an original movie not a copy someone else had made. When I opened the case I had found it to be a copy which is not what I wanted.
1,black market copy,"This was a recorded copy, not used as I ordered. I thought this was illegal. I was surprised to get this from Amazon. The movie itself was great."
1,The girl with the dragon tattoo,Your system would not let view movie since I was in France. It charged me for the movie. I rate it poorly.
1,Disappointing,"If I hadn't read the book first, this movie would have made as much sense as Alice's trip down the rabbit hole. Characters dart in and out of the action with little context and no explanation of who they are, and the plot is disjointed and confusing. To make things worse, the audio is horrible and all the actors seem to have perfected the art of mumbling. I suppose elite ""filmies"" will consider these factors to be indicative of a cinema masterpiece. I consider them a waste of time."
2,"Too little mystery, way too much graphic sex **spoilers**","My title says it all. I had the mystery figured out at the beginning. The acting was atrocious, although the character Lisbeth was intriguing. I like Christopher Plummer very much but he had so little screen time. The sex between the 2 main characters was unnecessary and dull. The mutilation of the cat didn't fit in the story. I'm sure the book was much better. Don't waste your time. I bought this one but will toss it to where it belongs."
5,:),Perfect. Need I say more? Rooney Mara deserves the Oscar for this movie. She did so wonderful in the role. Do yourselves a favor and put aside 2 hours and 38 minutes to watch this masterpiece. Thank you. ;)
3,The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo,"Part of the DVD skipped at the end , otherwise it was okay. Would not recommend this DVD. Not able to get regular screen format."
5,Dragon mania,"I loved the Swedish version of this film, even with just the subtitles, but the English remake has it's unique differences that make it just as enjoyable. I no longer have to read subtitles, it has Daniel Craig, an awesome animation intro played with a cover of Immigrant Song, and some more violence. The DVD version is interesting because of the movie's hacker theme; the disc art is portrayed as a bootlegged copy with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo printed on as if written in Sharpie, which confused several less observant people. I fully recommend the purchase of this movie in any shape or form."
3,"Great movie, but this was a copy.","Not the original disk a copy, Why?The movie was good, movies are always different in some ways from the book."
2,"Great movie, bad shipper","I understand that being a 'cheap' copy, I shouldn't expect much. But the packaging was scratched and dented and they sent me a HOMEMADE copy, with the title handwritten on the disc. Is that legal? It was a little grainy and dark, but since I paid so little for it, wasn't worth paying postage to return. The movie itself was awesome. Gruesome, suspenseful..great characters, plot. And Daniel Craig and Stellan Skaarsgard in the same movie? Heaven...at least to this reviewer. Obviously not as in depth as the book, but impossible to be, since the book was so long and involved. But they did a great job. Not for weak stomachs. Aside from the shipper, I loved the movie. But will definitely not order from them again."
2,boot leg,"If this was not a charity organization I would be livid. I opened the package which looks legit and low and behold a Dvr copy of the original. I know they know better but I gave them a pass because it's the Goodwill, however I temper that with clean up your act. Better not send a F.B.I. agent one of these or Lucy will have some explaining to do."
2,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"You cannot compare the foreign film with the much wasted American version.It was not even worth the $.99 (cents) I paid to watch this movie.They should have named it ""The Girl with the Wagon Tattoo"" and made it into a comedy movie with Jack Black and Daisy Fuentes.Uugh."
2,The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,"The video would have been fine I think, if we could have heard it, but we were unable to get closed captioning to function. This is a big problem for me and for my husband. There was a notation on the folder that some of the functions would not be available for ""special features"". If I had known that closed captioning would be considered a special feature I would not have purchased the DVD."
1,Too explicit!!!,"Well, I went and saw this at the movies with my daughter-in-law. Silly me. I was so mortified with the close up rape and sex scenes throughout this movie. I had no idea it would get this bad. We couldn't even make eye contact and at parts I didn't even look at the screen, lest somebody might think me a pervert for watching a young woman get raped . Had I been alone I would have left the theater!!! I won't bother watching the rest of the series when it hits the big screen.Sadly, the story gets kind of lost between the sheets. Normally I enjoy a good creepy thriller like 'Seven' with Brad Pitt or 'Texas Killing Fields' with Sam Worthington but this was too much for me. Should have been X rated!"
1,this dvd was faulty.,it skipped a great deal. i checked for dust etc and there wasn't any. the movie was very interesting and i was very disappointed.
5,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,I was surprised this was released to DVD so soon after being in the theaters. This was a fantastic movie which followed the book better than most Hollywood adaptations. The casting was well done for Mikael and Lisbeth. I even prefer this version to the original Swedish version of the film. I can't wait for the new two!!!!
4,Much better than the earlier film adaptations,"It could be a matter of personal taste, but this version is superior to the 2009 adaptation. Though they were very similar, this one felt much tighter and better acted. Daniel Craig was a better Mikael, and Rooney Mara was every bit as good as Noomie Capace as Lisbeth. Some might disagree, but all in all the chemistry between the two leads was much stronger I felt in this version. I am very much looking forward to the next 2 films."
5,Awesome,"Forget about being annoyed they remade an excellent 2009 adaptation. This version is excellent as well. Let yourself enjoy it. This version helps celebrate a great story, a great character, and a great author. That should be celebrated. Especially with all the junk that is turned into movies now."
3,Not as good as Swedish version.,Scaled down story with raw parts sensationalized. Strayed from the original story line and if you had not seen the original or read the book you would be confused.
4,Good movie,"This was a good movie with really fine acting.A little gritty subject matter, but well worth a watch...check it out"
3,Read the book?,Follows both the European version and the book quite closely. Worth watching but not great. Slow start but the action picks up at the end. How the main characters evolve as a team is interesting.
3,Worth Seeing and Owning IF You are not going to View Swedish Version.,"** Spoilers, SPOILERS** IF You haven't Viewed STOP READING!HUGE Daniel Craig and this is One of The Hottest Directors in Film but IMO this Film was just not up to par with The Book or Swedish Version. Acting was Good as was Directing but I just didn't feel ""pulled in"". Lisbeth had a RUTHLESS ""GUARDIAN"" and this One was not as Brutal making You Feel even more for Her and Less for Him even Hating Him in the Swedish Version. In this Film He was much more ""Humanized"" and Far less of a Sociopath as in Swedish Film. Ending in Original Was Captivating AND Touching and ALL seemed to be explained much more Clearly I felt in Swedish Film. I did like that they kept at least the Swedish Accents and Filming/Scenary were Beautiful as well. ****I would NOT by any means say this was a Bad Film in any manner only that I personally preferred the Swedish Version**** My point is I am NOT ""BASHING"" this Film whatsoever. Cheers :)"
2,Don't know how it ends !!! Rentals need a change !!! (48 hrs not just 24 ),We rented this title in the evening and it was too late to continue to the end. When we were able to resume the following evening (after work) it was already expired !!!! (although by only an hour +/-).Either change the pricing to $1.00-1.50. (and I'd consider renting more)Or... make them 48 hour rentals ! (or at least till midnight of the following day !!!)
2,girl w/dragon tattoo,My disappointment in this product was that it didn't come in regular DVD and I misunderstood when I ordered. I got Blu Ray discs and do not have a Blu Ray player. So I haven't had the chance to watch the movie yet.
3,ho-hum,"I haven't read the book, but probably will now that i've seen the 3 Swedish originals twice and the American theatrical release. So I can't yet comment on the relative accuracy. This one is OK, but I can't see any reason to recommend it over the originals (assuming you can read subtitles). Besides, Noomi would kick Roony's you-know-what any day of the week! (I found Roony's performance relatively vacant and unconvincing). And I could have done without the graphic mutilated cat scene of the American version (even though I assume that must have been in the book). I'm not saying to stay away, but watch the originals first!"
3,Never heard of the movies details,"If I had done any research about the content, I would not have picked this movie. I can see the story line and movie were well put together. The theme is rough, quite sexual and the images are graphic. Alot of the movie was something I closed my eyes for. As an adult it's often tempting to watch something that is not remotely edifying. If that's a concern don't watch it."
1,If you don't want to update your PS3...,Then this isn't the movie for you. This movie is amazing. I love it. Was happy to pickup the Blu-Ray today. Popped it in my PS3 and it will not play unless you update the PS3 to 3.65 or later. This is an issue for anyone who keeps there PS3 on a lower version to keep features sony removed from the hardware. This is in my opinion a five star movie but the mandatory update forces me to give the release only a 1 star rating. Be warned anyone with a PS3 below 3.65. This movie will not work for you on blu-ray.
2,I knew I was right,"I didn't read this book because, first of all, it's by a foreign writer. Call me whatever you want, I just don't read books by foreign writers. Even when everyone was saying how wonderful it was, I just couldn't make myself read it. I read the reviews and the synopsis and it just didn't seem like something in which I'd be interested. Then came the movie and my niece telling me how much they enjoyed it. So I broke down and gave it a try. What a waste of my time. All I could think of when the movie was over was - well - I certainly could have done without that. How depressing."
2,Problems with Amazon Download,Good film but had several points where the download / buffering hung for several minutes during the film and spoiled the watching experience.
1,Not worth the time,We saw the original Swedish trilogy and this new release doesn't even deserve to have the same title. The original goes into so much more depth than the time alloted for the U.S. version that it lets the story unfold. If we hadn't seen the original we would have been lost for the story was so chopped up that it barely made any sense. If you have the time see the original trilogy - - if not don't waste your time. I purcahsed both copies of this story from amazon.com and knowing what I know now would not recommend the new version to anyone.
1,I did not receive an original.,"I opened what I thought was going to be an original dvd only to find that the dvd was not an original. The title on the disc was handwritten by someone. This was clearly a copy of the original. I have a dvd recorder, so I know a copy when I see it. If I had not wanted an original, I would have recorded it from pay-for-view for $4.99. Amazon sent me a replacement, but when I opened it up it was the same un-original dvd with someone else's handwritting on it. I sent one of them back. Now I am afraid to order more dvds. Why pay $22 for something I can make myself for $5?"
1,I won't be ordering any more of these movies from Amazon,"I started watching the movie last night, however the movie was really long so I stopped it mid way. I was about to watch the rest of the movie and lo and behold the movie is not in my video library. Now I don't know what the policy for being able to watch a movie but I am not about to re-order a movie for 5 bucks, that is not even as good as the original just so I can finish it. Now normally I get a movie for 48 hours, if 24 hours is the time that Amazon has determined to allow me to watch a movie then I'll just wait and watch the movie for free on Netflix, at least I don't have to quit my job so I can get home and watch a movie. Big Thumbs Down to Amazon.I still would like to see the rest of the stupid movie I paid for."
1,The story is good,"The story is solid. Do not expect a normal movie, this movies should be rated XXX for violence and graphic torture. We only watch a man get suffocated, a guy get tortured with a can and a girl get raped while being handcuffed, gagged and blindfolded. A sweet movie."
1,Not worth the money,"After all the hype we thought this would be a good thriller. Instead it turned out to be an ugly movie loaded down with unnecessary adult content. In short, the story and presentation insulted our intelligence."
5,I loved this movie,"I have seen it in this version and the foreign version with different actorsThe foreign film followed the book more closely, but the actors In this version were perfectly suited to their rolls.It is a disturbing film."
3,The DVD is clearly a bootleg - it is written in sharpie!,"The movie works and the packaging seems to be original, but I don't know how you can sell a copied DVD legally. I have to wonder if I am I in violation of something by keeping it. Used is not the same as buying a copy."
2,Disappointed!,"I had recommended this movie to a friend, having seen it on cable. About halfway through watching it, a maddening series of freezings set in, at least several dozen. I had to reverse it and hit forward to get thru each freeze. It SO spoiled the evening, and doubtless this DVD is (somehow) defective. First time this has happened to be dealingh with Amazon."
2,Change the Ending--What??,"I love it when they come out with movies based on books. It gives me a chance to see what someone else had in mind when they read the story on paper. This was no exception. I read the book-and enjoyed it immensely. I was excited to watch the US version of this movie. It was awful. I couldn't understand the actors because they were talking SO LOW. I turned my volume up the whole way and all I heard was mumbling. The only thing that was plain as day was the sex scenes, which there were plenty. Yes, the sex was in the book, but it wasn't the main point of the story. I felt that they focused way too much on the sex, and not at the heart of the story.To top it off, they rushed the ending and CHANGED it. I read the book and half the time I had no idea what was going on towards the end of the movie. The ending was terrible. I heard the international version was better, I'll be watching that one soon."
2,ho-hum,The first part of this film os nearly a shot for shot remake of the original. The rest of the film strays only a little. The truth is that this movie has no value. Just watch the originalthos version adds basically nothing.if u haven't seen the original then you may find this interesting little mystery movie.
2,"Interesting, but disappointed","I loved the plot, but the movie flow and production was disappointing. The acting was only fair despite an all-star cast. Two stars..."
2,"Good Movie, Incorrect Billing","Loved the movie, it was as everyone has described. BUT, I ordered the HD....which was not as clear and crisp as expected, so I will never order HD from Amazon again. ADDITIONALLY, I was charged a different price than what was advertised. I am giving 2 star because the movie was good, but will not order via amazon.com again for a movie rental. The rest of amazon has never disappointed me, but this service blows."
3,Difficult to follow if you haven't read the book,"This is the movie of the first of a 3-book set. The books are somewhat complicated as the story weaves between time periods and physical loactions with different sub-plots occuring simultaneously. Had I not read the books, I'm not sure I would have been able to follow and understand the movie. The acting and photography are excellent. The movie closely follows the first book which causes it to bounce around in time and place. Will a second and third film be produced for the remaining two books? I am doubtful, but I hope so, even if it is a difficult story to follow. It may be possible to get the videos of the original Swedish TV program of these books but with captioning."
2,AN Apology,"I had purchased this DVD ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" From a vendor through Amazon. The I DVD I received looked exactly like a home made copy. Therefore, I posted a negative rating against the vendor. Amazon informed me that the movie maker released this last issue of this movie like this. A picture of it can be seen in the the ad for the movie. Unbelievable. Therefore,On their word, I'am posting an apology To Amazon and The Vendor.Arlett Gallagher"
2,Standard thriller nothing special,I heard so much about this story from people who read the book. I started the book but never finished. I didn't see the movie in theaters but I thought that I would catch it on Amazon so I bought it. Instead I saw it on cable. At first I thought it was interesting but as the story went on I found myself less and less interested in who did what to whom. It became a standard thriller that tellegraphed it's ending a mile away. I also didn't get into the characters at all. Too bad.
2,The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo trilogy,"The trilogy that I purchased stated that it was ""Dubbed"" in english, in fact it is sub titled. The story is great though."
2,A little hard to follow,It seemed at crucial times the sound/language was impossible to tell what was being said. I read the book and they needed to cut back on some details to fit it into a movie - I just wish they would have cut back on the numerous rape scenes involoving Lisbeth and her guardian.
3,See the original Swedish films!,"As a fan of the Millenium Trilogy, I went to see this in the theater. I didn't hate it, but I do think they spent a lot of time, money and effort to make a film that doesn't capture the book in the same way that the Swedish films did. That said, I would see it again."
3,"Very good movie, less than good disc condition.","I have watched one , parts one and two. The dubbing in English was top notch and the movie entertaining( good acting ). However two of the dvd discs where scratched, but I have not viewed them yet to see if it will affect the audio/video."
4,good movie,It was really good and very close to the book. I just missed a few details from the book. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is sensitive its a very graphic movie
1,Don't buy ultraviolet!,Consumers need to put their foot down and not buy Ultraviolet copy products. It is NOT a digital copy for your use at anytime. Don't give them cash for it or others will follow suit! Buy real digital copy!Punish Sony and any company that uses the UltraV system! Don't buy the discs!
1,Digital copy expired,"Movie is great.But, we aware that downloading the digital copy expired on March 20th!!! Would have been nice to have that fact in the details of the purchase."
1,Great movie shame about the UV copy!,Movie and extra features are good I just hate the fact that the digital copy is one of the ultra violet copies that needs multiple user names and is not campatible with iTunes!
1,A copy of a copy???,Ok I ordered this movie expecting a professional DVD. What I got was a cheap looking remake that is handwritten on a cheap DVD.What's the deal? This is not the quality I have come to expect from Amazon.Please tell me this is a promotional thing and we are not paying people to dub films and copy them onto cheap materials. May be my last order for a while.
1,A totally disgusting Movie!,Lets just say the gratuitous sodomy rape scene kinda ruined this movie for me.That and everything else in it...Why would anyone make a movie so horribly unpleasant to watch and uninteresting?The director and actors in this movie all deserve life time Razzy achievement awards.
5,Converted Me,"This was my first attempt to watch a movie on my computer. I don't have any flat screens in my house. My tv's are the sizes of small cars! Oh well. Aside from the movie being totally awesome, I ran right out and bought a new lap top to watch more movies on."
3,Maddy Davis- Literature Circle Review,The book The Royal Diaries is a very good book about Cleopatra. It tells all about her life and where shes traveled to. Cleopatra is a very loyal person and isn't like the other pharaohs. This book is Cleopatra's diary and it makes her sound like she is the best person in Egypt. This book interesting and funny but sad at the same time.
3,should have got something better,"pros:-compact-crisp colourful lcd screen-easy controls-mp3 player functionality-verify your copied images directly on screen-one touch copy memory card buttoncons:-short battery life, 2-3 hours using screen-sluggish when flipping through high res images on screen-screen malfunctioned on me after 5 months of off and on use, expensive out of warranty repair.-can't listen to music whilst browsing photos-issues playing long .avi's (2min+)"
5,A Duel for the King of Games!,"Shaadi, posessor of the Millenium Key and Scales challenges Yugi's Other Self to test the strength of each other's hearts. If Yami fails, his friends, and Yugi will die! Later, Yugi meets a young elementry student named Mokuba Kaiba, the champion of a game called Capsule Monster Chess, kind of a combination of Pokemon and chess. Mokuba is the little brother of Seto Kaiba, who Yugi defeated in the last volume, and now Mokuba's out for revenge! The loser plays a penalty game! Can Yugi win with a rigged game?"
4,A good book without a story book ending,"Recently I have read a lot of ""happy"" endings. Where the main character saves the maiden, blah blah blah. I have read almost all of Christie Golden's work and find her a superb author. She seems to understand that real life is not what some write. Mistakes are made, and family memebers *DO* die from time to time. When you finish one of her books, any of them, you feel sad for the main character and all those who lost their lives, but at least you don't feel like they should live happily-ever-after. The Enemy Within was certainly her classic style, right down to the win/lose ending. It might lag a touch in certain areas, but it more than makes up for it in the climax and resolution"
3,Easy paying & quickly received,I was happy with the Amazon & liked the quick response from the seller. I expected a bit better condition considering the price as there are a number of marks on significant areas of some pages. I will use Amazon again.
1,One struggles to choose its biggest fault,"As I said in my review of his other album -One struggles to choose its biggest fault - Is it the cheesiness? The rickety, tinny sonics? The smothering banality of it all? The dated material? All of the above.Save yourself a headache and pass this dud."
5,UNIQUE,THIS CD IS IS A MUST FOR ANYONE WHO LIKES TO DANCE AND GET DOWN. BYLLI'S USES UNIQUE TITLES TO GRAB YOUR ATTENTION AND HE KEEPS YOU HOOKED WITH HIS INFECTIOUS HOOKS. A MUST HAVE.- NINA MARTINEZ:)
3,"Amusing, but not great","I have a feeling I'm in the minority, but I actually like this movie and have been looking for it for a long time. It's certainly not incredible film-making, but it's fun and silly in a laid-back kind of way. If you like your humour on the goofy side, this one might appeal to you. Picture Sherlock Holmes belonging in an insane asylum with Dr. Watson along just as much to keep an eye on him as to be his sidekick. DeLuise, Ackroyd and Hackman are always enjoyable even when the plot doesn't quite live up to standards."
5,Great Movie,This movie was a gift for womone who wanted this movie but couldn't find it at a store. This a great movie!!!
1,An absolutely awful movie,"Okay, so maybe there are 4 or 5 clever jokes here that I laughed at. But for the most part this is a loud, cliched, predictable idiotic film that is a total waste of a lot of talented actors. Dan Aykroyd (who can be very funny) does such annyoing and just plain terrible impersonations of famous people. The rest of the film just resorts to cheap stereotypes about different ethnic groups. Skip this film at all costs!!!"
2,"Lousy book, in many ways","THe book came from the perspective that cryonicists are psychologically flawed or mentally ill in some way, that they have something wrong with them.This is a book completely about cryonicists, but the author appears to be a psychology or sociology grad student doing research. However, the author is basically narrowminded and cannot think for herself. But, it is about cryonics, and offers anyone interested in cryonics a peek into cryonics history."
5,Unusual excellence,"Once I picked up this book, I found it difficult to put down. The writing draws you in, captures your imagination, and makes you think for a moment about what may be going on in the various sub-cultures of our society. Dark, enchanting, excellent!"
3,Former USN SAR Swimmer....,As a former USN SAR Swimmer that was on active duty when the Marine Electric went down I look forward to reading this book...with trepidation. Any other NAVY SAR swimmers care to share their reviews before I spend the cash on this one?MTMARINER
2,Waste of time,"I find it hard to believe that this is the same author who wrote _Song of the Wolf_. I'm starting to believe that she must have been truly inspired for that book because none of her other books come close to measuring up.I completely agree with a previous reviewer--the writing is dumbed down. I was bored, bored, bored. Not even the dialogue felt authentic. None of the characters seemed real and I never felt invested in the plot or the time period.If you're looking to read a Bittner novel, don't waste your time on this one--get a copy of _Song of the Wolf_!"
4,for folks who like heavy music of all genres,"These guys rocked back in the day. Good live show and both of there releases have that high energy vibe that makes you wanna go see the band. For those of you sulking that they are no more, look out for NEEDLEMOUTH, Dennis' new band out of Hunington Beach. A little more industrial which is what I liked about 20 Dead. THe only place I could find them is on MySpace."
4,Cardcaptor Movie 2,"At first I thought it was a shame that they couldn't use the same voices as in the show, but that was soon forgotten as the storyline progressed and evolved. Love how it has kept close to the Magna by using original names instead of the ones made for USA version. Sad to see it all come to an end But it was a good ending, that did the entire Cardcaptor Sakura line justice."
4,Excellent,"It was so adorable and hilarious, there were some parts.The dialogue wasn't too great but I still loved it."
5,Awesome Movie,ok this movie was awesome. the voices where different but better they were made to sound more japanese although i recommend listening to it in japanse it really is a movie worth watching the only thing bad is that it had a really cheesy ending but i still liked it ^_^ i give this movies 9 out of 10 stars
5,Simply Fantastic!,"First of all, I wish the end would be extended a little bit longer so I can watch what happen to shaoran and sakura!!!!!!!!!! Anyway, this is one of the greatest cartoon ever made!!!!! If there were more coming out I would definitely buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I really hope the authors would write some more so we can watch some more of this masterpiece!!!!!! I give it 100000 stars out of 5 stars!!!!!!!!!"
2,could of done MUCH better,"i found the movie itself fine, but the redone English voice actors horrible. COMPLEATLY re done, no voice actors were the same from the series or the first movie. this greatly affects the quality. extreamly poorly done.its almost like looking at the manga or japanese version(cept in english). wording and characters are compleatly changed. they dont even seem (or sound) apropriate.i was extreamly dissapointed."
5,Wonderful movie!!,"This movie is wonderful, I even shouted ""Wonderful!!Kawaii desu!!""(I learned a little japanese from a magazine I read)the movie was incredible, I really liked the story and everything else. go and buy it, you won't regret it. Promise. (I really love IT!!!)"
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This movie is honestly nothing short of amazing.I must admit I was a tad worried because of the original Cardcaptors. But this dub was one of the best dubs I have ever seen done to an anime! The dialogue matched almost to a T. The voices that were chosen were great! They really fit the characters.This brought back the spirit and heart of the anime that most had thought gotten butchered by Nelvana.The animation, colors, sound, BGM, and effects are lovely and absolutely do not disappoint.This is a satisfying ending to an anime that left us hanging and a great alternative to the manga ending that leaves us just as satisfied."
5,Cardcaptor Sakura 2nd Movie,"This is a fun movie that tells the end of the cardcaptor story, beginning where the TV show left off. It's one of my personal favorites!"
5,this is the best movie,"(""RELESE!"")I LOVE THIS MOVIE! the first part makes you think,""what the heck are these monsters from!""but,then you find out that tomoyo(madison)made the tape and sakura used CREATE card to make the monsters.then theres a unedited seen was on the tape with showron(Li)and sakura with the bubles card.GET THIS DVD IT ISNT cardcaptors! its in english with cool iporate for kid voices.It is the last cardcaptor sakura movie!it's so sad!(sniff)(sniff)thats all for now see you next time!"
4,Excellent dub,"This dubbed version is awesome. The voice actors were selected as to sound close to the original Japanese voices. And importantly, nothing in the plot was changed from the original, unlike the Movie 1. You can enjoy the movie in English, as well as in Japanese with English subtitles. It's worth watching the emotional movement inside Sakura in her hesitation before declaring her feelings to Syaoran in the end.Plus, this DVD also contains Leave It to Kero Theatrical Version (Kero and Suppi's Takoyaki War). It's hilarious."
1,My doctor is an English professor,"At this stage in the life (or prolonged death) of Freud, only 2 groups still ""follow"" the ""Master""-- psychoanalysts, ill-trained for anything else; and English professors, who find Freud explains everything (anything). Appreciating that few if any read English academics' endless psychoanalyzing of Dickens, etc., Showalter now decides to enter the field of medical diagnosis. It is a breath of fresh air to find out that noone is really ill, most especially those who somehow think they are. Medicine needs more English professors. Perhaps we'll soon have whole HMOs peopled by escapees from dull English departments. Think of the money we'll save: ""Next? Hello, nothing wrong with you; all 'in your head'"". Take it from me. After all, I'm an ENGLISH PROFESSOR. Next?"" -- and etc. Why didn't we discover English doctors years ago? Thank God for Showalter."
5,Excellent Scholarly Examination of Late 20th Century Disease,"I just wanted to say, having ACTUALLY READ this book, that thethose who attacked it here were the ones who made me buy it.That being said, this is an excellent survey on the subject, with wise insight into those who exploit, to their own ends and further victimize people by using the stimatization of one word: hysteria--- while not examining the power of psychosomatic illness. While I would toss out most of the Freudian crap, it---it only makes sense that our culture is making us sick. We are dehumanized by corporate materialism, social darwinism, social isolation, and definitions of worthiness based on bank accounts and toys. At the same time, everyone is told they are expendable. Is it any surprise, that people are depressed?"
3,Missed opportunity (but still essential),"Why are there so many tracks on disc 1 that are readily available on the Sax Pax for a Sax CD? It's too bad more of the impossible to find recordings from this period couldn't have been included instead.Otherwise, it is great to finally hear some of this material and the disc 2 live concert is a treasure. All things considered, a bargain and a must for Moondog devotees.Also note the packaging is very attractive -- but unfortunately on my copy, the binding/glue is already falling apart so the CD trays have seperated from the cover... sometimes plastic is a better way to go..."
4,Moondog,This is a two cd set. The first one is recorded in a studio the second was recorded live. I was not familiar with his music until I got this cd. Sometimes I am into it other times not. I'm working on it.
1,I was robbed,"I dont think this original artists or something. I am going to get rid of it. I mean I have memorized my old tape of Eqyptian Lover, on the nile - and this aint it. -Dan val Dan"
1,Buyer beware,"These are not the original tracks so they sound close, but if you have the original song in mind from your younger days, you'll be disappointed.I shared this disk with a 15 yr. old friend and he thought it was great, but I feel like I was dupped because I know what the originals sound like. Buyer beware!!"
2,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * *,Who would like this? : horror fansWorth seeing?...-buy it : maybe-rent it : yesNight of the Living Dead (1968)George A. RomeroDirectorDementia 13 (1963)Francis Ford CoppolaDirectorRevolt of the Zombies (1936)Victor HalperinDirector* great value here for fans but Night of the Living Dead & Dementia 13 are both worthy of and in need of restoration.
2,comfort but not quality,Great wearing boot right out of the box. Super light and perfect for warm weather EXCEPT as pointed out by another owner the sole delaminates from boot.They tore up like a lousy retread tire. Only glued together and poorly at that. I expect more from Browning. Do NOT buy these
1,Overwraught!,"I eagerly awaited the book's arrival, as I was an officer on board at the time the author fell overboard while the ship was tied up in Newport, RI, May 1963. It is mostly legal documents referring to her suit for damages, but it is certainly a poor history of the ship (which she always refers to as the USS J.P. Kennedy, Jr.) when its name is the USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. She reprints some of its history, but somehow completely skips the years 1960-65 (I was aboard 1962-64). Most of the pictures have nothing to do with the Kennedy, or indeeed its mission.It could hardly have been more boring or less informative. If you must have it (no library will) buy an inexpensive used copy!"
5,Toti dal Monte CD- Pearl,An excellent CD. Toti dal Monte is is a fun soprano to hear. A true product of her era 1920s thru 1930s. Pearl did a fine job transferring the original 78s to CD.
1,"Not as good as Walter Dean Myers' classic ""HOOPS'",I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE UNREALISTIC AND FAR BENEATH THE LEVEL OF THE ORIGINAL BOOK 'HOOPS' WHICH IS A FAR MORE INTERESTING STORY.
1,Please avoid this species,"Chilean seabass (actually called Patagonian toothfish) is being fished to extinction. These fish take decades to reach maturity and live as long as 80 years, but they are being caught faster than they can reproduce.Try black sea bass, striped bass or rockfish instead.References:http://www.net.org/marine/csb/http://www.mbayaq.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_factsheet.aspx?gid=6"
4,"Very nice, i'm glad","Good quality shirts, with beautiful images, excellent printing, but not standard sizes, many T-shirt length is longer than it should be. Cloth a little rough, not soft cotton. Rating 4 out of 5"
4,It does the job,"I like this, it does the job. However, if I was an accountant or someone who had to input a ton of numbers this would be annoying. Every time my computer sleeps it doesn't always recognize it after. Also, the toggling between the computer input and just regular calculator doesn't really work. It says it's on computer, but it's not showing up. I have ended up just using my Mac keyboard. Also, not very handy for a laptop. Maybe for a desktop for portability. It's just OK."
5,Great Read,"This was an awesome book, great plot, lots of mystery, and great sex scenes...it was hard for me to stop reading it.One problem, it had TONS of typos, it was alittle irritatingOverall great book...BUY IT"
5,Go Buy Now!!! IT WAS GREAT!,I have always loved books by this author. You can see whats shes writing and it draws you right in. You will be up till the middle of the morning finshing this book because you wont be able to put it down. Read any book you can by her and you will know its worth it.You also might like francis ray or brenda jackson
2,Download Issues,"I tried to finish this book, but I couldn't manage to read beyond the first few chapters. The constant typos and the lack of correct spacing between character and scene changes really distracted me. I'm willing to give the book another try if Amazon can correct the content.--LK"
3,Quality issues,"I downloaded the Kindle version and was disappointed by the quality. There is no extra space between paragraphs when the scene switches to a different group of characters, typos abound, letters in words are transposed making it difficult to read. In one memorable case, the character Sean is suddenly Sejum for a page. These issues definitely affected my enjoyment of the story!"
5,Delicious AND nutritious! At least a 12!,"Absolutely the best book I've ever read on the history of the personal computer--both in terms of information and entertainment. In fact, one of the 10 best non-fiction books I've ever read.A wonderfully wry, sometimes gossipy style disguises a smoothly informative narrative and keen insight. (Best example of the latter: the ice cream coupon story.) I read AE when it first came out in hardcover and bought copies for everyone I knew...read it again when it was re-issued as a trade paperback and bought copies for everyone I'd met since the hardcover was out. (I'm not rich, but I wanted everyone I knew to get the same enjoyment I'd had.)Besides, can you REALLY resist a book that has chapter titles like ""Chairman Gates Leads the Happy Workers in Song""? Can ya?"
4,Accidental Empires,"Accidental Empires follows the rise of the tech industry. It is written by Robert X. Cringely (not his real name), one of the original founders of Apple computers, and gives a firsthand perspective of the industry. Accidental Empires is written in a humorous tone, and reveals many of the character flaws of the leaders of the tech industry, proving, in essence, that they're just a bunch of nerds. Accidental Empires is an above average book and I recommend it."
4,A very nice anthology of recent history,"If you are interested in reasons behind the rise of Microsoft, the early demise of CP/M, and other historical facts about the computer industry, this is the book to go for. Cringely is a very informed reporter, who is not afraid to intersperse serious overviews with juicy remarks. This is a book about nerds who became billionairs, which means it definitely deserves to be studied carefully. Interesting and thought-provoking!"
3,Good but could be better,Overall this book is great.Could have been better if it had a different approach to how the text is constructed. It's like having a very informal talk with someone that's been on the IT industry for very long. For the same price range you can buy a much better book (Where Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins Of The Internet) which is a lot better constructed and has a lot more focus on the history and the development of technologies instead of a focus on the technology industry.
4,I love nerds!,Even though this was purchased as a gift for my Step Dad. It still has some great information and is pretty funny! A must have for all you pocket protector wearing handsome men out there!!!
5,Funny and Informative,Crigenly tells the compelling story of the uprising of a small company becoming a million dollar businesss. He is very informative on the histroy of the computers in a different tone and style of writing that is easily understandable.
1,Could have been great...,"This book has all the earmarks of something that could have been great...all it needed was a different author. In page after page, what came through to me most was Mr. Cringely's bitterness at not having an accidental empire of his own, of not being a Silicon Valley millionaire. This taints so much of his writing that it makes me skeptical of his ""insider"" knowledge of the industry and of his opinions of those who created the industry. I also find it disingenious that Cringely goes on a tyrade against Apple in his book but fails to mention he was an Apple employee (one if its first 12, actually) ... obviously one who failed to make his mark on the computer industry and so has turned against it with acerbic attacks"
3,Very informative; raises questions.,"Congratulations to Dave Rees on putting out very good history of a very good and enigmatic band. This chatty book fills in many details that true Tull fans will have been wondering about. However, it also raises questions. For example, WHY was (is) the management of Chrysalis so inept at marketing Tull? HOW has Martin Barre managed to stay so long? WHY does Ian have to be such a prick? -- All in all this is a very good book. Nobody but Rees could've written such an objective and appreciative history without fawning over the band. Way to go Dave."
2,"A chronological history of a band, but not much more.","Rees has written mostly information that has already been written about Tull. There is little emphasis on the formative years and how this band grew from being a group of teenage friends who played in a garage in Blackpool to major rock stars in the Seventies. In short, the later years are over-empasized. Also, the philisophical nature of the music and the philosophies of the musicians themselves seem to be missing, or at least secondary. I would like to know more about why the music came out the way it did than when and where."
3,"Good, but could have been a lot better","I bought this book a long time ago. It was the only book in english telling the story of this groundbreaking band of the 70's in 1998 (when I bought it). I found it to be very informative and well written in many ways. But it fails on some crucial factors: it tells absolute nothing about Ian Anderson's background. Such colorful and intelligent man should at least be given a chapter only about his formative years and his motivations. Unfortunatly the book tell us nothing about them (or about the other members, for that matter). Also there is very little about the songs and what's behind them. Still, I liked because it told a lot of things that were not clear to me (the story of how Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond joined the band and his leaving is particularly interesting).I'm still looking for a definitive biography on this incredible band. One that will tell more about Anderson, Barre & co as humans too, not just as members past and present."
5,changed my life...,"Before Todd's book, there were literally days where I would stay in bed wondering what the point was of even getting up. Now I see that each day is an opportunity, an opportunity to further build the leadership potential I have inside of me. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to fully realize their character and life goals! Thank you Todd!!"
1,Todd is a Great Man,"Do you know Todd Connor? I know him, and by God, you are no Todd Connor. This book is full of new-age zingers that deliver nothing but platitudes and Deltish euphenisms. Skip it and watch Braveheart a few times, that will make you a great man."
3,Read if Mandated,"The book is tremendously boring. The introduction, written by the editor, was so littered with qualitative research lingo that you need to be a master to understand her assertions. This book is for a doctoral program introductory course to qualitative research. Maybe it might have been appreciated by students in the advanced stages of this type of research."
5,Supercalifragilistic,"This has to be the best of all from Susan Branch -- how she keeps her work so fresh and interesting is absolutly amazing plusshe has the best recipes you can find in any book -- I get her annual newsletter ""Willard"" and in it she says she tests all that she includes --and I believe it. That shows me how hard she works and how much she cares ... She let us all know AUTUMN would be coming out in her letter and I was one of the first in line to get it -- and could not lay it down until I had read it cover to cover -- It`s that interesting! --and the artwork is---- a work of ART ! Facinating ! I cant wait for October to get here so I can make that Gingerbread Cake for Halloween . My daughter says,""when she grows up she wants to BE Susan Branch!""This is a smart kid ...and Thank You Susan , You Made Our Day !"
3,Wonderful use of form,"This book gives a lot of form to our four-legged animals by showing musculature and how to apply that to the sculpture. Also reviews how they set up the armature for the sculpting and describes the use of ""life"" in the action. Wonderful reference for the lion, horse, bull, etc."
3,Lady Butler deserves a bit better,"This is a heavily illustrated book, with good selection of artwork including paintings and sketches. Unfortunately the small size of the book and limited number of colour plates precludes it from being a worthy tribute to this fine lady of the brush. There are no good close-ups or crops of any of her paintings. I am hanging out for a better book in future, but this book is presently the best on the market that I am aware of."
1,Don't buy it,"Terrible sound quality. I was told I sounded like an alien on the other end. My husband and I both got one and were testing between the two of us to see whether perhaps only mine had a defect, but it was the same with his headset. However, the customer service was great and easy, I called the next day, got the RA number right away without any questions, and we got our money back (including shipping) very soon after we returned the product."
3,More novel than practical,"I bought this product and unlike others, I have no problems with it hooking up to my phone and the sound quality is fine. But this IS a large headset, so where the fun of walking around a store with it does get you some funny looks and is amusing, the size makes it not practical for regular use. I do use it if I am at my desk and the phone rings because it does feel better to talk into then a regular little phone. The one thing that does not work is the button on the head set. I think its supposed to either answer the phone or switch between calls when call waiting kick in. For me it does nothing at all, now this could be due to the settings on my phone and have nothing to do with the set, or it can be the button does not work with some phones. Either way, I bought it as a novelty and it works just fine. But really, it is too large to carry around with you all the time."
4,"I Hate Small Cell Phones, I Love this Gadget!!","We have only had this for day, but what a difference. I can do all sorts of work, hands free, just like the good old days. Maybe I am old fashioned, but after several different models, blue tooth just didn't cut it for me. Have the time I couldn't hear, the other half they couldn't hear me.Sounds is clear, works perfect, just like an an old receiver. This is easy to use, plug and play and your off to 1980. Gotta love that!One other big bonus. If there is a chance cell phones do cause brain tumors, you no longer have than mini broadcast tower next to your ear, your back to the exposure level of an old fashioned phone."
5,This thing is great!,"It's so much easier to talk on this handset than on a tiny little flip phone. I'm 6'1"" and today's mini cell phones are just too small for my comfort. Plus, I can hear people more clearly and they can hear me more clearly. Of course, it looks cool, too!"
1,"Looks good, sound quality is horrible","I am extremely dissapointed in this phone. I bought this for my business so I would not have to hold the cell phone near my head, while the quality sounds good to me, anyone I talked to on the phone, could barely hear me and they ALL asked if I could do something with my phone because it sounds very strange. I also started experiencing dropped calls about every 2 minutes. I have never dropped a call until I began using this phone. Perhaps there was a short so it would hang up on my customers...Not worth the money. I need to sell mine and buy a better one, guess I will go with a name brand more expensive one."
2,stem broke,"This watch is a handsome piece. The accuracy of time was adequate but not sound. after several months, I noticed the stem wheel was missing. I have no clue how or why, but chalk it up to todays lack of quality control. As I become an older adult, I continue to be amazed at the amount of junk out there."
4,Easy for little ones to play on PS3,I ordered this game for my 4yr old and I to play together. He loves it and so does the rest of the family. It is easy for little hands to manipulate and advances through the levels quickly. I would recommend this for the very young gamer. Older kids might get bored. Excellent value.
2,This game is not worth to be for PS3,"I bought this game only because it was really cheap, My GF and I played it only once. I tried to play it more, but I got bored and I sold it for 15 dls more than the actual price!!! he he, incredible; but ohh well I got Resistance Fall of Man with that extra money.If you want to play this kind of games, get a Wii."
3,Not for the PS3,"I mean, this game has PS2 graphics and I bought this game only because it was really cheap, very cheap. I played it only once.If you like this game, then you must buy a Wii."
3,Aspect ration is incorrect as listed,"Well, I thought I had finally found Alien in the 185:1 aspect ration, in which this DVD is advertised. However that only applies to the Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The other two movies are in aspect ration 235:1. I know it shouldn't but those black lines bother me, when I have a 16X9 high def flat screen TV. Seems to me wide screen should be wide screen without those irritating black lines, when you have a wide screen TV. But that's just my pet peeve. Bottom line, the information provided here is incorrect for 2 of the 3 movies in this set."
4,The Cat Who Sniffed Glue,"Another interesting mystery with Qwilleran, the middle-aged news writer turned millionaire and his Siamese cats Koko and Yum-Yum. I listen to this series on my way to work since they are so light and enjoyable.Qwilleran's mansion in Pickax has a famous library filled with antique and rare books. This time Koko becomes fascinated with them because of the glue used on the binding. Koko becomes obsessed with the smell of glue of any kind. As usual Koko's behavior helps Qwilleran solve the mystery..."
5,"This book is brilliantly written,and deserves five stars.","This is the best murder mystery I have ever read in my life.I love how Braun brilliantly hides who the murderer is and somehow gets the cats in there to help with the mystery.This is the best ""The Cat Who"" book that I have read so far."
4,Amusing Complexity,"""The Cat Who Sniffed Glue"" follows in its typically serial vein with the usual fluffy fodder of feline fancies, but enhanced with a more sinister plot. While most assuredly not bordering on lurid, it is a welcome spin on the usual ""Cat Who..."" entertainments. Written as a play, it is piquantly refreshing due to familiar characters but change of setting, hosting the thrillingly suspenseful atmosphere of the theatre. ""The Cat Who Sniffed Glue"" rises above preceeding installments with Braun's usual wit and the perpetual fascination of whodunit. Delightfully cunning!"
5,Koko Solves Another Case,"Jim Qwilleran, or Qwill, has recently left the big city to move to the city of Pickax in Moose County. Life is good. He is decorating a new space and has a lovely young decorator who seems to making plays for him. This is causing problems for Qwill's relationship with Polly Duncan, the town librarian.Qwill joined the local theatre group. The play practice is going smoothly until one of the actors is murdered with his wife. Qwill begins to investigate the murder and finds out many new details about Pickax residents and Moose County.The Cats, Koko and Yum Yum, begin to act strangely. Little does Qwill know they are working behind the scenes to solve a crime and repair a relationship.I enjoyed this Lilian Jackson Braun novel. I plan to read them all. If you like enjoyable mysteries with cats you will love this book."
4,just what i order,The distributer fit like it should and I got two screw with it to install cap.prize was just wright for product .
3,Great Sounding Disc,"This review has nothing to do with the Vince Gill record, one of my favorite artists, but of the product as DVD audio, it is the first one to play in my new Oppo Digital universal disc player.Well, This one was my fault, I did not have the disc player opimized for DVD audio, it is now excellent sounding, like it is as good or better than a SACD, sounds like Dolby Digital, This Cd has been mastered for DVD a very well and I have been really loving it. You really have to read the manual carefully.The hybrid CD version of ""Eat A Peach"" by the Allman Brothers just blows me away too. It seems to be able to only make one thing sound better at a time. The guitar tones now sound realistic, it sounded like there was a lot of distortion on a solo by Gill, just not his style, especially for ""Hi Lonesome Sound"" ,I really do not think it's the OPPO, This disc player is awesome in presentation of music!!!"
3,Nice Sound,"This albums sounds very clear, specially track 10, the piano sounds amazing, the rest of the disc is of if you let it roll on the highway and if you like country music, i would like it to have more slow songs."
3,"Well-made, not used much","I bought a bunch of Sesame Street finger puppets to go around my little girl's birthday cake as part of the decorations that could also last as future toys. They are all very cute (I think we got all of them made except Oscar the Grouch). They are well made and look like the characters (only Big Bird and Ernie look very slightly off). My little girl though, just has never had more than ten seconds of interest in them, and we've now had them almost two years. She loves puppets, but not so much the finger puppets. I love to read reviews of people who've owned something for a long time and can give an overall view of something, so I can say that in two years, almost nothing has changed with these. On an interest level of 1-10, she's had a level 0-1 interest in these for almost two years now, even though she loves Sesame Street. She also loves her regular hand puppets (not Sesame Street, just animal puppets I found)."
3,Stick with the earlier stuff,This is ok but anyone listening to this first would want to know what the big deal is regarding Blowfly. Find the early stuff first such as Blowfly on TV. This CD is for hard core fans only.
2,The best one is missing,"I always loved Blowfly (and I am a woman) I think he was hilarioussssssssssssss but his best ones are missing""Electronic Pussy Sucker""I see Blowfly as COMEDYI don't understand People who say he is too nasty but the Love Eddie Murphy, Chris Rock, Chapelle, 2 Live Crew etc etc if it wasn't for guys like BLOWFLY, Redd Foxx or even Richard Pryor those guys would have no chance!!!!!!!!!!"
3,disliked,songs were cut off. not original. this was not from the original songs. i was very disappointed with this disc
2,I wish I had waited,"I bought this camera to replace my camera that takes film. I wish I had waited and saved for a more expensive camera. It's an ok camera. The flash is so bright that my daughter looks like a ghost. I tried it without the flash and it's really dark. I can't set it up as a webcam, which I thought I could. You can't use the flash with the camcorder function, so the picture is really dark. It doesn't fit in your pocket, it's at least 2 inches thick. You really do get what you pay for. I went and bought another roll of film for the pictures that I want to be of quality. I use the digital so I can send pictures of the new baby to family members."
5,More than a quilt,"My daughter's best friend had her 11th birthday this spring. She's been making ""quilts"" for a year, hand stitching very diligently, then learning how to use a sewing machine. She creates to give away. When I found the gift set of this book I couldn't have found a more appropriate gift. The story is wonderfully told. The art work is exquisite. The message is so needed in our possession crazed society. I bought the latest copy for my daughter's 11th birthday. It's a great way to affirm generosity of spirit."
5,I loved this book!,"I am a sewer and artist and found this book to be a treasure. If you like to work with flowers and paint and or sew, this book shows you how to do those things in combination. It also inspires. The photos are stunning, the directions clear, the subject is flowers. I will keep this book not only because it shows me how to do flower pounding, but because the book is beautiful."
2,Um...er...doesn't stand the test of time,"See the cover. When I review stitchery books I normally put up Images so you can see inside. But there's no reason to here. This book was published in 1972 and it's pretty ""groovy"" as you can see on the cover pillow. Even though produced by the esteemed Margaret Beautemont, I'm letting this one go."
2,Bittersweet - Leave well enough alone!,"I enjoyed reading this book, but at the same time, felt sadness. Cynthia Rylant did a good job of capturing some of the spirit from the other books, but I feel that the reason Laura herself didn't write about this time in her life is because she wanted to forget it. The family experienced so much sadness during this time and maybe she didn't want others to know about it. While reading it, I just kept thinking about how Laura would feel if she knew people were reading this.I first received the complete set of Little House books when I was 9. I'm 30 now & still read the complete set every fall. I won't put this book with my precious & well-worn set because I will never consider it a real part of the series."
3,Mixed Feelings,"I love the original Little House books, so when I saw this novel claiming to detail ""the missing years"" I thought I'd give it a try. It was interesting to read someones view of what may have happened during those years between ""On the Banks of Plum Creek"" and ""By the Shores of Silver Lake."" But that's just it-what MAY have happened. The main structure of the story was true, but the events were fictionalized or made up.Also-if Laura didn't write about these years herself, there must have been a reason. It almost seems an invasion of privacy to guess about what happened to make her not want to write about the time. If she had wanted us to know, she would have told us.I did enjoy this book. But if I ever buy it, I won't put it on my shelf between ""On the Banks of Plum Creek"" and ""By the Shores of Silver Lake."" I don't consider it part of the ""Laura Years"" and I don't think it should be listed as so on the back of the book."
4,It was ok...,"I liked this book ok, but like other reviewers, I missed the detail of Laura's original books. I kept expecting to get to the part where Mary loses her sight. If I recall correctly, at the beginning of Silver Lake, she tells us that Mary had gone blind after suffering from scarlet fever.I also thought it was odd that the girls never noticed that Ma was pregnant! I didn't notice the bangs in the illustrations till I read the reviews here, but they are absolutely right!I can understand why Laura left out these years in her books. With little Freddie dying, Mary losing her sight, and moving to places she was not enthused about, she likely did not care to share these stories."
3,Anachronistic illustrations,"This book is written well, if a bit too simply. While this book has value as a fill-in, I was galled by the grossly inaccurate illustrations. Clearly illustrator Jim LaMarche failed to study Wilder's books beforehand. In every drawing, the girls have bangs, even though Laura herself did not cut her hair into bangs until much later in ""These Happy Golden Years."" And where are the ubiquitous sunbonnets that that were de rigueur for proper young ladies in that era? The girl on the dustjacket front looks smarmy, self-satisfied, and not a bit like the real Laura - an odd, inappropriate illustration for such a tragic story. I'm adding the book to my collection, but I will toss the dustjacket, and I wish I could delete the inside pictures."
2,Disappointing,"This book is supposed to fill in the ""lost"" years that Laura Ingalls Wilder chose not to write about, when her family gave up their failing farm at Plum Creek and moved to work in a hotel in Iowa. The author did a good job of glossing over the sad things that happened in this time (such as the death of her baby brother), but you won't find any of Laura's vivid descriptions and enchanting storytelling here, as much of the writing is flat, undetailed, and repetitive. The book also ends misleadingly, without mentioning the family's return to Plum Creek, where ""By the Shores of Silver Lake"" picks up, so if you're following the series, you're still left with a gap. All in all, the writing really doesn't do justice to this classic series, and I'm surprised the publisher didn't make a better effort. (If you want to find out about what really happened in Laura's life, ""Laura Ingalls Wilder: A Biography"" is very well-done.)"
5,knights of the black rose the conqueror,"this third of the series was fantastic, could not put it down until finished. when you dream of a book that you just read,and feel like you are there,this is what reading is all about."
2,too much fluff,"This book could have been half as long if Birch wasn't so interested in talking about herself. For the most part, this is book about why Birch practices yoga.Certainly there is a lot of quality content here, but it is sparse and has been covered more thoroughly by other authors (Schiffmann and Farhi for philosophy, Kraftsow for yoga therapy, and David Swenson for asanas).The program which Birch recommends is basically a watered-down ashtanga yoga workout in the primary series, with a few embellishments.When this book was initially released, it would have been a very valuable addition to any yogi's library. However, with the current selection of books and videos covering this subject, it has become obsolete and unneccessary."
3,Not a beginners book,"This book has many great pictures and a lot of good theory. I especially like the sayings that summarize the book at the end, e.g. ""Even iron will bend if you heat it up"" etc. However, this is not a book for a beginner of yoga like myself. I had taken power yoga at the gym and thought that it was an easy type of yoga (not meaning that it isn't hard work physically), or at least easy to get into and get a lot out of. This book makes it a lot harder and might even discourage people. But perhaps yoga is best taught live and not by the book?"
2,Not about yoga,"This book has lot of useless information i.e. personal life of author, etc. Too much emphasis on philosphy and less on technical detail of yoga. It did not serve my purpose. If you want to read a book on Hindu philosphy and yoga this book may be for you, otherwise get another one."
4,Good book,"I was initially looking for a yoga book with a more practical side to it and easy viewing of the poses, so I could just get into it.This book was much too wordy for my liking. Author talks about herself a little too much and her descriptions of the poses are much too lengthy.It is nonetheless a good book (even though not quite what I was looking for)"
5,my only complaint is that it doesn't come hard-bound,Kant's CRITIQUE was my favorite book for a couple years. POWER YOGA beats it hands down. I can not say enough about this book. Do not buy it planning to stretch calmly for five minutes a day.
4,"Good book, but you have to read it!!",It's a great book of astanga yoga with a lot of goodexplanation about it and the postures. The only thing that's annoyingis when you try to practice with the book it's a little bit hard to follow so thats why you have to remember every instruction.
2,Confusion,"Beryl Bender knows what she's talking about in her book. She can bend too. However, I found the book very confusing visually (I'm a visual artist.) I think is overdone. It needs some editing and a better layout for the pictures."
3,"A good beginners' text, but not (quite) the real thing","I enjoyed this book and found it really useful when I bought it. At that point I had been practicing astanga yoga for about six months, and the level of explanation in it was really good for the amount of experience I had then.I still think it is probably the best astanga yoga book around for people who are new to yoga practice, but I haven't looked at my copy for quite a while.The main objection I have to it is that the book doesn't make it clear that what it is presenting isn't the complete astanga yoga first and second series. There are a few omissions from first series, and large chunks of second series are left out. I don't necessarily disagree with doing that in a book that is mainly aimed at beginners - I do disagree with doing it without saying so."
2,Not what I expected at all.,I was very dissappointed with this album. I was hoping that The Potter House Mass Choir Would have been on here More that they were. I was not feeling this album at all. TD jakes needs to stick with the Potter House Mass Choir.
3,Does the Job BUT!,This does the job but the LED is real hard to see. If you have plenty of light no problem. IF it's dark it will be a real challenge.
1,Does not do the Job,This does not do the job the LED does not come on. I returned it.I would like one that works.
4,"Magic doesn't make a great book, but subject matter alone...","It doesn't truly ""live up"" to the concept of dealing with the dragons of Dominaria. The stories, being short, are admittedly difficult to write. However, I felt minimal true involvement with the characters. Like any anthology, it has some good stories, some great stories, and even some outright boring stories. The stories of the fall of the Primevals and Urza's draconic creation were fun to read, and as such redeemed the book greatly in my opinion. The section about wild dragons was also a saving grace. It's a great book to borrow from the library, but there's minimal reread value...borrow it, don't buy it."
5,Action Packed.,"Operation Barbary Coast is the third book in D.A. Hodgman's Code Zero series. I have not read the others, but this book is a very fast read with non-stop action. Did not want to put it down.Code Zero is an elite unit of the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). And it contains only seven agents. The have an executive order to exterminate with extreme prejudice from the oval office itself.In this novel an Aryan supremacist group, called the Team, believes that it can help their cause best be eliminating the drug traffic. But they get the attention of Code Zero when the unintentional murder undercover DEA agents. We follow their pursuit by two Code Zero agents, Harry Wolfe and Carmelita Morales.The action does not slow down in this well written adventure novel."
4,Great summer moisturizer,"I love this as a moisturizer in the spring, summer & fall, because it's just right for my skin. Now that it's winter in Minnesota, the air in my home and work place is much more drying and this isn't quite doing the trick - so perfect for summer, not enough for winter in my opinion. What I love is that I never break out from this and most moisturizers make my skin react with rash or breakouts."
2,Eh... not moisturizing enough,"I suppose this would be ideal during summer months, but I didn't love it. It felt very, very light on my skin - to the point where it didn't feel like I had just put moisturizer on. I think for the price there are better products out there."
3,THREE TEXES,Somebody needs to say that all three of these star Tex Ritter and one is directed by serial expert John English.
3,Tarnished when I recieved it,"Pendant was very pretty, but does not lay flat, it keeps turning over to the side. The biggest problem is that the chain was very badly tarnished."
1,Don't bother,The seal is lost if there is a speck of food on them. This has just become and expensive cover for food in the microwave.
5,Great product at a great price,AC Delco stock part at a great price. Turns out the boy didn't need this part after all. We just disconnected the battery and put the dash back together and everything started working fine with the old part. Keeping it just in case someone else ever needs a light switch.
2,Too much talking,You will spend more time hearing biographical anecdotes rather than the actual hands details you may be looking for. Hire a makeup artist.
4,Un cliché tras otro,"No es un mal libro, es solo que es un cliché de pelicula/historia de horror tras otro. Aunque bueno, el hecho que soy tan escéptico pudo influir en esa opinion.Recomiendo este libro a todas las personas que gustan de fantasmas, apariciones, brujeria y cosas afines. Claro, tambien es recomendable para escepticos como yo, habrá dos o tres cosas que no les seran tan indiferentes."
5,Zen music at it's very essential.,"In ""Komuso: The Healing Art of Zen,"" Ronnie Nyogetsu Seldon performed a wide range of shakuhachi pieces that has now been surpassed in this CD ""Makoto: Shinjitsu."" It truly shows why Seldon has become such a sought after musician of the Japanese bamboo flute, with a range of performance from the eerily contemplative title piece to the much bolder ""Jinbo-Sanya."" This is a fantastic album for quiet contemplation and meditation."
5,Love this sugar bowl,This bowl is elegant and simple... very nice. I may look into matching pieces! :)
4,"Well Done Show,Nice change from Star Trek","I can not say enough good things about this very well done show and a sci fi fans fun series to add to their collection.Sadly I can not agree with the price that it is being sold for, really dude its Blu ray,not some rare metals item but a four season dvd set and worth 60 bucks at best!Obama might spend money like this but I can't and this is just an item I'd like to have but not an item I have to have!Again great show,wonderful cast,well written,fresh bit of sci fi but the price is too high,I'll wait."
1,Not Exactly what i was expecting.....,"Im not sure if i can find the words. This is not Blue Ray quality. 1st of all the first 3 seasons are not even full screen. I can get that on netflix !! Then on season 4 where there a full screen, it seemed pretty grainy at times. Is it a little better than standard def or standard dvd quality, maybe a little. Nothing earthshaking. I was expecting more. I just can't believe they had the nerve to put blue ray on this. I loved this tv series and watch it on netflix all the time, i saw this blue ray offer and thought great ! Didn't happen. I feel like i just threw away $100.00. What a shame more effort wasn't put into this."
1,Horrible,"Not fullscreenBad qualityAnd missing episodes (thé finale)ExpensiveShouln't be on bluray.Its lame, Expensive, Tv logo in corner.. Wtf"
3,wanted more,it didn't have peice keeper wars in it as 5 disc and said was complete series asmumed it did but the 5 disc special features and contain the shows finnally
5,Farscape the complete series,"Product lost in mail. Amazon made good with a prompt replacement. First order did arrive, and was returned. The series is excellent! I always wanted to have viewing control and watch the series from beginning to end without commercials. Pure pleasure watching a state of the art Science fiction program."
5,worth every bit,"This is a series not to be missed, i enjoyed it and highly recommend it to any sci-fi fan"
5,Worth every penny,"I was not fortunate enough to see this amazing series when it first aired, but after seeing Ben Browder as Lt. Col. Cameron Mitchell on Stargate SG-1, I thought it might be nice to see Farscape. I am still blown away by how great this show is. It's nothing as it seems... and the depth of the characters, the story, the effects... It's really amazing. It's a shame it didn't have longer."
5,On Sale,Got this on sale.Great sifi story. Great characters.Watched it before it was even popular :PAnd now I can watch it again. :)
5,Bought these for a Christmas Present,"Bought these for my husband for Christmas, he loved them. I bought these along with the Farscape Movie: The Peacekeeper Wars!"
5,Love the series..,"Had to buy the set, also purchased the Peacekeeper Wars to complete it.It's weird but I had/have a ""crush"" on John and Areyn as a couple. Fun sci-fi series, that does get a little dark/twisted."
5,Can't beat it!,"If you love Farscape, you have to buy the series. One day it will be gone, and you won't be able to get it.Now it is in my collection forever!"
4,Farscape: The Complete Series,I love science fiction. This was a fun series. I did get tired of Scorpius. Glad this site suggested it.
4,Farscape,"Haven't watched it yet, but I loved the show when it was on TV. Got it as a gift for Christmas."
4,Good Goofy Sci-Fy,"I was not sure if I would like this series because of the Muppet style of some of characters. But after watching a few episodes I was hooked. Although it seems that a lot of the episodes they are saying goodbye to each other because it looks like their lives are over. (It gets a little annoying) I mean how many times can you say ""I'll miss you"" and ""You were the best part of my life"" Other than that it has a lot of fun humor, good fighting and interesting characters."
3,No Subtitles on Farscape DVD,"I read online that this product had subtitles, which it does not have. There is no menu where one can navigate to add them on the DVD version of this series. I was bummed about that because the house is too noisy for me to hear everything when the kids are home. I prefer to turn on subtitles rather than crank the volume."
4,Decent Show / Great Service,"As for the content: Would rate somewhere in the middle of TV Sci Fi series. Entertaining, but no Firefly! As for the service from Amazon - the first copy we received had a cracked disk in Season 4 and there was absolutely no problem getting a replacement and *then* returning the defective version. Why even bother with Brick & Mortar stores when the even the customer service is better on Amazon?"
2,Strange!! No CC!!!!,Rounding out my collection with some military and sifi stuff that you can watch repeatedly.... This was a strange space sifi series that was underrated and way ahead of its time... Maybe a little too far ahead... I'm a little disappointed with this particular collection product... The folks that put these DVDs together have a couple of the series out of sync on the Season III Disc and the collection is not subtitled.... No closed captions... What's up with that... I'm deaf and rely on subtitles to keep from constantly turning the volume up during close personal scenes and scrambling to turn it down during action scenes. I watched this series when it originally came out back in the day and had forgotten how you love to hate each character... Antiheros all with Officer Aeryn Sun (Claudia Black) the exception... Strange but entertaining... Regardless my disappointment with this particular purchase... Amazon and it's dealers are great.. Fast shipping.. Great prices....
5,Great set,"Each season is Wrapped sepratly, and then they are all wrapped together. So, if you're in a hurry that can be annoying, but other then that they have very good sound and picture quality."
5,It's Grrreat!,"I fell in love with this series after the first couple of episodes! As Sci Fi goes... this series and the ""Fire Fly"" series are my fave's!!"
5,great series,"I bought this for my son's birthday. we both loved this series when it was on Syfy, and were very upset when it was canceled due to production cost. The characters are well played by some very talented actors. the plot lines are very good and the scenery is awesome. It was put together very well and was not cheaply made, thus it was canceled for being too good, not lack of ratings. If you love science fiction you will love Farscape."
5,Seeing the series again was like visiting old friends.,"The series was way too short. The production value and the smart scripts were much too high quality for TV. There is just a dumbing down of SciFi to becoming mindless blood and guts horror. For reasons I can not fathom there are not enough women who are hard core GOOD (read NOT blood n' guts scare 'um) Science Fiction. But I loved the series and am glad to own the DVDs. The bonus features were fairly interesting but, if you also bought the Peacekeepers movie, a bit redundant."
5,One of the greatest science fictions shows ever.,"I first discovered this show on netflix because I have never had cable and wasn't watching much tv when it was on since as I was in school. I have come to discover this amazing show filled with tallent, inventivness and imagination. I hope to see more shows like this!"
4,"No subtitles, A&E Peacekeepers!","A tremendous value to finally get to see this series in a complete set (or, complete set minus 'The Peacekeeper Wars', it would seem). And what a treat to get so many commentaries on the shows, judging from the first season alone.This brings me to my complaint, and the reason I only give four stars out of five: A&E; decided not to include one word of subtitles with this series! How can you possibly enjoy the commentaries without being able to put the dialogue up on the screen?Then even more insulting, a stupid message at the start of each DVD, written by A&E; Scarrans, saying that ""the commentaries do not represent the opinions of A&E; Affiliates, as none of us have any opinions worth a bucket of spit"". Yeah, thanks A&E.; Whomever wrote that disclaimer should be forced to inhale Hynerean gas and be dumped into the Uncharted Territories."
1,It misrepresents itself as HD by being formatted for Blu-Ray,DVDs would be just as good or better for this. There's no high definition content to speak of. There's really no reason for this to be on Blu-Ray at all.
2,No Closed Caption - A&E strikes again,"Did you ever try to lip-read a Jim Henson puppet speaking with a British accent?The only reason I give it as many as 2 stars is that it is a great show. I enjoyed it when it was first broadcast because I still had some hearing left and there were closed captions on the broadcasts. Without closed captions, it is a waste of my time.On the box and each of the 5 DVD holders, the closed caption logo is displayed. The Amazon description and the NewMedia (distributor) website description both clearly state that closed captioning is included. I played several of the discs on various players and computers, to determine if it were a problem with my equipment. Closed captions are NOT available.Then I noticed that it was an A&E; TV production. I have run into the same false information on their other videos. They also heavily censor when they actually do provide closed captioning on other shows.Also, the aspect ration is 4:3, not 16:9."
4,"Good Set, slight let down.",I would have given this set five stars had it included a Blu-ray version of the Peacekeeper Wars to an otherwise great set.
5,Savefarscape,"Man, I love Farscape. Great show. Outrageously original and pretty clever overall. The only season set that's wide screen is the fourth. Other than that the set is well put together and exactly what you would expect."
3,farscape the complete series.,"I had high hopes to this series, since the lead actor ""Ben browder"" came from stargate atlantis.I have to say that the quality of stargate atlantis is way much bether then farscape.In my opinion farscape gets a rating of 5 from 0 to 10. It is OK, but nothing more."
2,A rather mediocre series,"I know that i will disagree here with the farscape fans but i couldn't find this series interesting. Mostly becouse it doesn't have a theme or at least a serious one. Yew it has good visual effects, bizzare aliens and the premise of travelling to an unknown part of the universe far from our galaxy. But all these premises were sacrificed to an adolescent romance and to the simplistic story of an insane commander who pursuits the central character. Nothing like Star trek or Babylon 5 or Galactica. All in all nothing really interesting."
5,"Great package, Great Show!","First I decided not to buy it because it did not have english subs but now the price has been dropped so hard and so fast, I could not do anything else but buy this great set. I will have to pump up the volume of the TV set but it's worth it. I'm especially greatful the seasons are packed in slim cases, saves a lot of room!About the show, first I had to get used to it, but beyond that, it's a truly great show, great characters, great stories. It's a must have for any sci-fi fan!"
5,Farscape collection for the fan,"Farscape is a great series that was taken off the air far to early. Its to bad the Sci-Fi channel didn't keep this going longer.Farscape is the name of a NASA project. Things go wrong and the hero is swept to the other side of the galaxy where the real fun begins. Fantastic places and fantastic characters really add depth to the universe, but the stories get deeper and more intertwined. This is more of a sci-fi soap opera along the classic lines of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon. I've watched it from beginning to end and I'm sure I'll watch it over many times in the future.What is great is that its an affordable price."
4,'Bout Time!,"It took ten years to get this collection together but its definitely worth it. If you like Farscape, the Complete Collection offers almost everything you could possibly want. Every episode, including the un-aired original Season 2 premier, heaps of cast and crew commentaries and deleted scenes to perk the interest of hardcore fans. The Archive disc provides a really complete look at the set and making of Farscape, as well as great interviews with all of the major cast members. The only thing the box is missing is the Peacekeeper Wars, a glaring omission, but one that is easily fixed with one additional purchase. I could wish for its inclusion in the set, but given how hard it was to get the distribution rights away from ADV, I'm not going to complain too much."
5,Excellant Viewing,Watching reruns does not have the same effect as seeing it in order from start to finish. I have learned so much from just watching the first three episodes. More things make sense now.
5,Loved this series,"This turned out to be one of my favorite scy-fi series. I am primarily a Star Trek fan, but my sister suggested I watch these, and I fell in love. The characters interact so well together, that you will forget you are watching a TV show. Even the puppet characters come to amazing life. The chemistry with all the characters is amazing and I love the story lines. Highly recommend this series to everyone!"
5,Awesome Series!!,"I love the Farscape TV show, so this was an awesome buy!! I love all of the extras it comes with. Overall, I would definitely recommend this for those who like scifi shows."
4,Farscape Blu-Ray,"Farscape is, was, a great show. It is interesting, well-written, has a good plot and plot-points, and is well worth watching.The Blu-Ray version of farscape is not that much better than the original DVDs if only that it takes up less space due to having only 20 Discs in one package. The picture quality is good but is shown in original 4:3 aspect ratio (first 3 seasons) and anamorphic widescreen (4th season) but does not include PeaceKeeper Wars Miniseries. I upgraded from the original DVDs and haven't noticed that much of a difference. Good show, good packaging, average/slightly above average picture quality. Do buy if don't own the show already, Don't buy if already own the DVDs."
3,A&E set (SD quality) vs original ADV set (near blu-ray quality),"I initially viewed a few of the original ADV discs (Blockbuster rentals), and so, was expecting quality close to this with the $59 A&E set. Boy was I disappointed when the A&E set arrived. The ADV discs were near blu-ray quality, whereas the A&E set was SD quality. A&E images were ""soft""(lack of detail), not razor-sharp like the ADV discs, when viewed on my Panasonic 42"" 720p plasma set. I quickly purchased the complete ADV collection (Seas 1-4, NEW) for $90 delivered! These were the same sets that someone told me were **$149 per season** when released. If you are like me, and want ""near blu-ray quality"" for a few dollars more, don't wait. Buy the ADV collection NOW (from Amazon resellers)before prices begin to climb again."
5,YES!!!!! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST SERIES EVER!!!,SO FRELLING AMAZING! One of the greatest sci fi series ever made. The exceptional story lines are matched by the chemistry between Ben Browder and Claudia Black. Once again please put the series out on bluray and don't forget the concluding miniseries. Once again this is one of the greatest series ever and needs to be on bluray now.
3,Bad video quality for a Great Series,"I love Farscape and having the series in one package on less disks than the previous issue sounded pretty good. However, the quality of the video on this release is horrible. There are compressions artifacts to the extent that they distract from the plot. I have never seen a DVD that looks that bad. What a disgrace!"
4,short and simple review,"i bought this as a gift for my fiance who LOVES Farscape... that being said, i simply wanted to add that he loves the set but was frustrated that it was not in widescreen... i too was disappointed, but oh well =/"
4,"An absolute ""must have"" for any sci-fi fan!","If you've seen Farscape, you already know you want this. If you haven't seen Farscape yet, & call yourself a sci-fi fan, what's wrong with you? ;-)This set consists of a big box, with 5 smaller cases within to contain the 4 seasons' worth of dvds, plus one case with extras. Right there, is the only flaw with this set: the extras are pretty much a waste, and should have been replaced with ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" mini-series that was released several years after the series was unceremoniously canceled when everyone had been told there was going to be a 5th season. So as it stands, this is *not* the ""complete series"" as named, since it is missing the vital wrap up; that's the reason it only got 4 stars from me instead of all 5. Oh well, it's still the best option going for any Farscape fan!"
3,Disappointing outer box,"I haven't started watching the actual show yet. While I'm sure the video quality should be good enough (I'll append my review if needed), the outer box is enclosed on all sides. The case is flimsy enough that you'll wear it down pretty fast if you actually store the dvd cases in it. I'm excited about the show it's just clear this is a budget release. Waiting to release a sturdier slimpak version later?"
2,Is this Blu-Ray?,"The title says Blu-Ray, but in the Product Details, it says NTSC. Which is it? Some of the reviews said the quality was'nt Blu-Ray quality. So I'm going to assume it's not true Blu-Ray."
2,Farscape The Blu-Ray Release,"Product DetailsActors: Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Anthony SimcoeWriters: Rockne S. O'BannonFormat: AC-3, Box set, NTSC, WidescreenLanguage: EnglishSubtitles: EnglishRegion: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only. Read more about DVD formats.)Number of discs: 20Rated: PG (Parental Guidance Suggested)Studio: A&E; EntertainmentDVD Release Date: November 15, 2011Run Time: 4086 minutesWell, as you see above it said ""Widescreen"" format. I'm on season 3, and so far, its been all full screen! On Blu-Ray? Full screen on a Wide Screen Plasma doesn't work for me. Thank god my Panasonic has other setting I used to make it better, but why should I have too! The package doesn't say either way, and no one else has complained about this this so maybe I have a bad set of discs. As far as the audio, it's outstanding ""DTS"". They did a very nice job on it, too bad about the full screen video."
1,Farscape: the complete series,I was very excited to see this series but season three disc six is damaged also season four disc sixI thought this was new I am very disappointed with this order.
5,Thoroughly Enjoyable,"I am very happy I made this purchase. While the first two seasons are excellent, the remaining seasons/finale are slightly less so. Nevertheless, the entire series is an enchanting adventure, made more so by listening to the interviews with the cast and crew. I learned a lot about film making and the joys and miseries that go into a production such as Farscape. It was obviously a labor of love and it shows on the screen."
5,the best series ever,i loved this series is why i bought this series and the movie to watch all over again this series was cancled to early it should have gone for alot more seasons then it did.the actors did a wonderful job making this series come to life and who ever helped on this series to me this was the best series!
1,Angry,"I have never bought a ""Complete"" set before that did not have English subtitles. I am hearing impaired and have no use for this set. I am angry. I did check, but found no mention in the advertising blurb, and stupidly assumed that a set like this would have captions. It would cost me too much to return this for a credit, so it is useless."
3,Amazed at the Reviews,"Update: This show gets better in the second and third seasons. If you stay with it, it's worth it.There were a couple of good episodes. Compare to Star Trek: Enterprise or Stargate: Universe."
2,farscape,thought it would be more like buck rogers but ended up being a lot of nonsensical suff that was hard to stay interested in. surprised it lasted 4 years
2,Admitted Next Gen fan,"The only thing that really kept me interested was whether the girl was ever gonna get the boy. Most stories were mostly fluff, which is fine-- I appreciate fluff. There were some reasonably good science-type sci-fi concepts."
5,Farscape Revisited,"I'm really glad I purchased the Farscape series. I had missed a few episodes, but also it was great to see some of the other episodes as well - I had forgotten more that I realized !. If you're a Farscape fan, I highly recommend this !"
4,Finally glad I found the whole thing,"My dad loves this show. He never missed an episode (EVERY TIME IT WAS ON). I found this for his gift this year. He is going to be ecstatic. Ta hell with ""a christmas story"" he will be watching this all day."
5,Not to be missed,"The best sci-fi adventure EVER. This is a must see series. If you are a true sci-fi lover, this will not disapoint."
5,Awesome and again Awesome,This comes in a box containing 5 DVD covers with about 6 DVDS in each cover. The covers all have 1 unique character from the show on the case. My husband and I are huge FarScape fans and were just so excited when we watched and then wrapped it back up for our Christmas present to the house.
5,Blu-ray for Farscape!!!!,I would greatly enjoy another release of Farscape; especially on Blu-ray! Please keep this thread going and maybe the decision makers will see the fan outcry for it and make it happen.Farscape is the BEST!!!!!!!!
5,terrific to have the set,"I have waited too long for this series to be affordable. It was the perfect Christmas gift for our daughter. Can't wait for her get through it once, so we can borrow the set!"
3,"Funny, good story, too abruptly ended","Farscape is an entertaining series with some creative uses of puppetry and special effects. The story has some slow spots and the plots are sometimes too ridiculous, but it is a fun series with some good acting and humor. The ending of the show was very abrupt and left too many questions, though they tried to wrap it all up with ""The Peacekeeper Wars"" made for TV movie. This show will entertain."
5,Soooo worth the wait....,"Farscape: The Complete SeriesWas worth waiting for it to be released, just wish it came with the final movie"
5,A must buy,"I'm a huge Scifi fan, I own all seasons of SG1 etc. I loved the 1st season of Farscape when it first came out but because of the crazy schedules that Sci-Fi channel had back then, I missed some of the later episodes and from there season 2 onwards it fell off my radar.I had considered borrowing the series from Netflix but let's be honest, at 3 dvd's out at a time, it will take forever to finish the series. Its a mentality thing. When I saw amazon offering the entire series for less than $60 I snapped at the chance.This past weekend, I watched the entire Season 1 of Farscape and was reminded just how good it is. Nothing beats having all the episodes available for your viewing. Even better is that selected episodes have commentary by Ben and Claudia.Considering that each season is about 20-24 episodes, that's less than a dollar an episode. This is a must buy for fans of SG1, Merlin, Star Trek etc. Don't miss out!"
4,Lots of fun,My 6 year old son loves to make believe. This set is perfect! He dresses in his work clothes - a blazer and some of dad's old shoes and sets up his desk in the corner of the gameroom .
3,Ok product.,Received the product as stated within the description and shipped earlier than anticipated! My children loved it for only a short period.
5,Adorable!,"My 5 yr old always wanted to play ""office"" I bought this and it is adorable. A little pricey for all cardboard like items however. They are covered in a plastic laminate so they can easily be whiped off if needed.Overall cute product and my son loves it"
4,celtic warrior [predator,I am a big fan of the predator movies and found the celtic predator by mcfarland reallya good collection to have I got mine used but the condition was excellent if you like collectingany predator fiquers this would be one to get for your collection.
4,Interesting read,"Although not exactly what I was expecting, this book was in interesting read about the Chinese naturalists and their involvement in how the West first came to know the giant panda. This book detailed many historical facts about how Western naturalists, with the aid of a couple of Chinese, moved through China and collected many specimens for display in the US. I recommend it to anyone who has a deep interest in the giant panda and the history behind our current love affair with these black and white bears."
2,can't get a good seal,"These goggles don't have an adjustable nosepiece. That, I think, is the reason I can't get a good seal. I'm looking for a new pair that doesn't leak."
5,Great Swim Goggles,"I like these so much when I lost my last pair I had to buy another. They are so very comfortable. I can swim for an eternity without them pinching, leaving marks on my face, and becoming so uncomfortable that I can't wait to finish my swim. I would definately recommend this aquashere brand to everyone. They are avarage in fog control. Vision is amazing. Comfort I've had nothing to get close in comparison."
3,Works but could be better,"This product has excellent fitting. However, I noticed that water occasionally seeps in making swimming uncomfortable with chlorinated water in the eyes. Haven't tried other products of this kind so can't really compare"
5,Sooooo comfortable!!,Awesome goggles. Comfortable and DO NOT LEAK! Just make sure you can swim with goggles and don't need a mask. Some people have issues with the water going in their nose and a need nose clip.
4,Great for training,"These goggles are terrific. They have the right balance of being snug on your head but not squeezing your eyes and leaving red marks on your face. My only complaint is that the goggle comes very close to your eye so my eyelashes brush against them (women, take off your mascara before jumping in the pool!).Otherwise, they're comfortable and leak-proof and I really enjoy wearing them. Will buy again in the future!"
5,Amazing goggles!,"You do get what you pay for! Quality-made product, straps are of good material and the goggles are fog-free and great fit. Couldn't ask for a better purchase."
5,First goggles I've ever worn that actually keep water out of my eyes!,"These goggles are fantastic. They are the first ones to actually keep water out of my eyes while doing laps. Every other pair of goggles that I have tried (which, to be fair, amounts to a few different wal-mart pairs) leaked and I'd have to empty them out every few minutes.The band is easy to adjust and doesn't pull my hair.I really like the huge field of vision, too."
5,Very comfortable,"I like this goggles. They don't put to much pressure on my eyes as other ones. Also, I like how they color everything around"
4,"Work well, but...",My daughter likes these goggles. Only complaint is that they slide off of her face when she dives. But they don't let water in or fall off during swimming.
3,These are okay.,"They still fog up a little, and water still gets in , which is a problem since I wear contacts in the pool. They are tight and I probably need to adjust them a bit more. Good value though for what I paid."
3,Broke the first time in the pool,"Our son in High School liked the fit and look of these goggles. He says he hit a lane line diving in the pool the first day he used them and they broke. Not sure that's the real story, but nonetheless they should hold up longer than one practice."
2,water gets in after a while,"When I initially had for a week they were great.But in couple of weeks, the water gets in no matter how I adjust it."
5,Functional,My 15 year old son uses it for the school swimming team. So far so good and no complaints. a
1,Aqua Sphere Google leaks,"Based on the number of positive reviews I bought the Aqua Sphere Kayenne and Aqua Sphere Kaiman swim goggles. They look great and are built with good materials, but unfortunately they both leak, and for that reason they are useless to me. I use the TYR Nest Pro Performance Goggle, used them before and wanted to find something better but I guess there is none. Any recommendation?"
4,"Great goggles, super affordable","I love these. However, I am one of those people who have a very high standard for a ""perfect"" score, if even attainable.When I first jumped into my pool with these, I was immediately impressed. However, after about swimming 10 laps, I did notice a small amount of water seep into the goggles - but I think this may have been because I didn't suck the suction part of the goggle to my face until after I jumped in.Great goggles, great prices. Buy them!"
4,Goggles for people with big noses,"I bought these goggles after doing some research on goggles for people with big noses -- regular cheap goggles cut into the bridge of my nose; a half-hour swim leaves a red mark for a week. Anyway, they fit the bill. They are comfortable, don't leak especially, and fit over my copious schnozz. No red marks. I bet they would be fine for people with little bitty noses too."
5,Im not a pro swimmer but I love these,"Very easy to adjust (without taking them off), comfortable, dont fog, leaking is very minimal....Bottom line: unless you are competing in the olympics just stop wasting time looking and buy these!"
4,Finally ones I can wear.,"First goggles not to leak after trying a bunch. I do feel there's a little water in them, but not enough to stop my swims. I might just need to do some further minor adjustment. But I couldn't swim at all with other goggles I tried. I have a narrow face and probably my eyes are closer together than on most women and just makes for awkward fits with most goggles. They seem also more comfy to wear, they seem stay clear and easiest to adjust. I've spent frustrating time with other goggles trying to pull the elastic cords and wdhatnot and you just don't have any of that aggravation with these. I just put them on and swam. I love stuff made in Italy, it's on top of my list of countries to visit one day. I like Italian cycling clothes, bicycle gear, food, regular clothes, pocketbooks, shoes, etc and wow, now goggles."
5,College,Very impressed with the tint on the goggles because the lighting is so bright and swimming is early in the morning. They are a perfect fit.
3,Okay,"These are nice but they did not last all that long. Starting leaking after a brief 2 months of use. Worked out great until then (2 months has been the average lifespan of all my swimming goggles since they came out with the all plastic seals, I am one of these people who do better with the old school foam seal). Still better than the ""base"" Speedo or Tyr model (including women)"
2,Cheap stuff,"I guess it's OK for the money, but feels very cheap and I would rather buy some other gogles next time."
5,Great Goggle,"After using Speedo's for years and years, I finally found these (recommended by a lifeguard at the gym) - and my life changed...:)Great goggle. I recommend!"
5,Best goggles,I purchased these after having continous issue with speedos purchased at target. i am prepping for half iron man and needed googles that fit and dont leak....these are the ones. They are soft to the face and can easily tighten or loosen. Highly recommend
2,LEAKS!,"I was very excited when I saw Made in Italy on this product. However I have tried adjusting them every way I can, and after 5 times in the pool, they are still not right. they fill up with water within seconds. I would not recommend these to anyone. I bought a pair of Ironman googles for my husband for $4 at KMart, and his work fantastic."
4,good to use,It is a good quality goggle.My son likes it.He made some sun block stick on it but I used some soap to clean it.It became good again.
1,Might be my face,"Well, the first time I tried these goggles I thought I had finally found the holy grail. Zero leakage. However, subsequently every time I used them they leaked no matter what I tried. So, I will give them to a friend. Maybe it's my head size, facial shape, whatever. I am back to square one."
5,Great in every way!,"These goggles are my new favorite! They are so comfortable to wear, the part that comes over the nose is silicone type material which doesn't hurt even after an hour of swimming! They do a good job keeping water out. So far, and I've only been using these for a month or so, they haven't started fogging up yet. One tip if they do start fogging up (my swim instructor told me this, haven't tried yet) - is to put them in the dishwasher. That apparently does the trick."
3,May not fit those with deep sockets,"I am a user of the Aqua Sphere swim mask and like it a lot. It is ugly though so thought I would try their goggles. However, they fit the eye socket rather than the bones around the eye so water leaked in for me after approximately five minutes of swimming. The swim mask doesn't have this problem as it fits the face itself.These are nice looking goggles and I am sure they fit most people. I do have deeper sockets than most though so finding goggles can be a chore. So for me, it's either the swim mask or the Barakuda Ultimate which also fits the bones around the socket rather than the socket itself."
3,pluses and a minus,"As others have written, these goggles are comfortable and are easily adjustable, but I have found that one has to work with them (when one first puts them on) to make sure that water doesn't flood the eye space. I have taken to putting them on, ducking under the surface of the water, and shaking my head to be sure that the ""seal"" is secure, with no water leakage. It can take several such ""dunkings"" to blend comfort with a secure seal, and in this sense the goggles are perhaps a bit more high maintenance than I'd like. Still, once a good seal is made, the Aqua Sphere Kaiman googles prove a comfortable set of goggles to wear (my former ones actually used to make me nauseous from the pressure exerted on my eyes...not fun when one is swimming one's mile's worth of lengths)."
4,Very comfortable!!!!!!!!!!,"Review from my girlfriend, who I bought these for:The eye cups really suction onto my skin. The most comfortable googles I've ever tried in my entire life and I've been wearing goggles since I was 7. They are so good that I will try another from this brand once this one wears out. The appearance is not great, as I look like a hipster nerd with thick black frame glasses."
4,I use these goggles daily,"I've used Baracuda and TYR goggles over the years and the Kaimans are the best yet. But there are a few considerations:1. The Kaimans don't come with a case - a bit inconvenient if you like to just throw your stuff into a swim bag like I do. This is why I didn't give this product five stars2. Kaiman goggles employ a sticky silicone that requires your face and the goggles to be completely dry to fit correctly. This information is buried in the instructions and easy to miss. The first few times you use your Kaimans, keep a towel on the edge of the pool so you can repeatedly wipe your face and the goggles dry until the fit is just right.3. Reviewers who complain that the Kaimans are too tight, gouge their eyeballs, etc. have tightened them up too much. If your face and the inside of the goggles are dry, the silicone is sticky enough that you should not have to tighten the goggles up very much at all."
2,Too Big for My Face,"These goggles are nicely made, flexible and stay put in the water but they're very wide and made for men or for people with a wide face. They were so big that the edges of the goggle lens came too close to my eye nearest my nose and obscured my vision."
5,Great purchase,"Like the others have said...very comfortable, well worth the price. The only complaint is the lens distortion but it's a minor inconvenience. Highly recommended."
4,Great goggles --- for my face,"These are the best goggles I've ever worn, but every face is different and my great fit might not work for you. They hold their anti-fog well and don't leak."
5,Great set of Goggles,"I received these goggles today and tried them out in my pool. They are extremely comfortable, easy to adjust, and a HUGE step above the rubber-lined cheapos I had been using. I just use them in my pool, so nothing real demanding, but I am very happy with these and I love the tinted lenses so my eyes are shielded from the sun. Very happy with my purchase."
1,it presses my eyeball,"I bought it because of the high review. But when I tried it the first time, the lens were too close to the face. They pressed my eyeball no matter how I adjusted. I could not blink.I returned it."
4,Excellent goggles,"They keep the water and chlorine out of my 11-yo son's eyes and he can see very well through them, but he says they are sometimes hard to tighten correctly, which is why they get 4 instead of 5 stars. Overall a BIG win for us!"
5,Okay....,These are just okay. they were great for a while but I find them wearing out sooner than other models I have. I am looking for something new.
1,Great fit but leaks,"I bought a pair of these goggles and within four months they started leaking. The lens is glued to the eye cup which is where the leak developed. The reviews were so great, and I really liked the fit, so I tried another pair. Within three months those started leaking as well. I'm kind of in a bind, because I don't like the fit of any other goggles I've tried, but I don't want to keep buying these and having them fail after a few months. Full disclosure, I keep my goggles in the pool house, which is kind of like a big greenhouse, so it does get very very hot in there. But my mother-in-law has the same pair of goggles, doesn't keep them in the pool house, and she says hers are leaking too."
5,Best ones I have ever had !!!,"I went through both the ""Speedo Vanquisher 2.0 Plus Mirrored Goggle, Silver/Grey"" and the ""Aqua Sphere Kayenne Goggle With Clear Lens, Clear/Black"" before I got this one. Both the above had issues with fogging and comfort. The Speedo Vanquisher was constantly fogging after a couple of laps and was not very comfortable. The Kayenne was a bit too large and was also fogging up quite a bit... These are perfect !! The blue tint is very good underwater, and gives EXCELLENT visibility. The soft silicone edges are extremely comfortable on my face, and barely realise that I have them on. There are many a time when I have raised them up to my forehead after a lap... and then as I started my next lap, forgot to put them back on and only realise once my eyes feel the water !! They never fog up, and hold up very well in the pool. Will definitely buy them again, and would recommend them in a blink !"
3,My head must be too small,"I'm a 24 year old white male and these glasses were just too big for some reason. I really liked the field of vision these goggles offer, it's pretty awesome, you can see everything. However, they let water in and just were too bulky for my head I think. I really wish I could give them 5 stars, because they are so easy to adjust, and feel great on my head. Sadly, I am going to have to revert back to my old speedo goggles because they don't let water in. The speedos are much tighter around my head and create a lot of pressure. I easily get slight tension headaches with them. With the Kaiman's the tension was dispersed very evenly and I didn't get the really tense feeling even when I synched them down all the way. This pair of goggles is made for someone with a slightly bigger head. I wear 7 1/4 cap size, so my guess is if you're bigger than that you should be good."
1,leak,"Tried these for a week and gave up. Maybe they fit some peoples faces, but not mine. Couldn't stop one or the other goggle from leaking no matter how tight I made them. If you even get a little bit of water in them it collects in the corner so you always feel there is some water in them - and when the water gets to much it starts getting in your eye. They drove me crazy. Worthless junk."
5,Goggles,These goggles work great. They fit very well and are easy to adjust. No problems with them leaking at all and lenses are clear and give you a wide viewing angle.
1,Fits poorly when they're not leaking,"These seemed like such a great deal from all the glowing reviews. However, they never really worked for me. They constantly leaked, and the only way that I could get them to stop leaking was to wear them extremely tight and to mash them into my eyes. This stopped the leaking, but, as other reviewers have noted, they were so close to my eyes that it caused significant physical pain during long swims. They had to be so tightly fastened that they would leave deep gashes in my cheeks for hours after use. A month after dealing with these I'm back to looking for a new pair of goggles."
4,"Good fit, seal","These goggles provide a tight fit without pinching. They fog a bit, but I notice that if I put them on before I enter the water, they take longer to start fogging"
5,Best goggles yet!,I've been an exercise swimmer for many years now and these are the best goggles I've found yet. They keep out water and sun glare. They stay in place and get me through my mile of exercise swimming very well. Would recommend them.
4,Comfortable Goggles!,"My six year old has been swimming for 3 years. We have been through a huge variety of goggle brands and styles trying to find a pair that is comfortable and doesn't leak. At first she didn't want to wear these because they were not pink. However, once she put them on, she now refuses to wear any others. She recently wore them for a 2 hour swimathon without complaint. They could be a little easier to adjust. If they came in PINK, I would have to give them 5 stars!"
4,excellent goggles,"I had never heard of this brand before seeing them on Amazon. In the past, I have always had problems with leaking and the band breaking. These have proven to be virtually leakproof. The material is very ""unslippery"" and makes a good seal. The band is very thick and much easier to adjust than other more famous brands I have used in the past. I would highly recommend Aqua Sphere."
5,Outstanding musicianship,"I can't get this CD out of my CD player (and I'm at work!!) I bring 4 or 5 CDs to work and listen to this one all day! The haunting lyrics and melodies and the superb musicianship of not only Pierce but Steve Brewster, Wayne Kirkpatrick, Phil Madeira, Blair Masters, Jimmie Lee Sloas as well as the production talents of Gordon Kennedy make this one of the best projects I've heard in a LONG time. His ode to his daughters (My Little Girl) is so touching it brings tears to my eyes every time I listen to it. Certainly as good as ""Butterfly Kisses"" and not half as smarmy. ""Comet"" gives me chills. One complaint: it's too short!!! As a matter of fact I'm listening to it right now and tapping my foot to ""Kingdom Come"". Keep it up, Pierce. We're out here listening and appreciating!"
5,My Kids Loved I Spy,"This is a fun series for younger kids. Probably ideal for ages 3 - 5. I found the theme song both irritatingly infectious and catchy. (""Whoops, I found it! How about You?"") I love the slightly imperfect feel of the stop-motion animation. You can feel safe letting your kids watch this and they will learn a few things while they're at it."
4,pretty good game considering movie games suck,"This is actually a pretty good game. Alot of people didn't expect too much from this game, but I have to say that I really enjoyed it. It is very short, but still is a ton of fun. It's a racing game that shouldn't be missed especially if you are looking for some fun. I bit the bullet and bought this game (for full price no less) and hoped for the best. I really wasn't dissapointed other than it going by so quick. That's what the 4 stars are for instead of five. I can't wait play the 360 or PS3 version. A definate worth checking out. Oh by the way, the movie is really good, so that makes this game a plus"
5,Sharing the Love...,"This collection really IS a labor of love. I thought I knew the 60's and Frisco psychedelia pretty well, but over half the cuts on this set are new to me, either performers I didn't know or different recordings/mixes from what I've heard, and few of them are less than excellent. The essays in the book are, as usual with Rhino, well-written and full of information, too. Almost as good as the music, the booklet includes dozens of excellent photographs of various bands, many of them previously unpublished. Grab several copies as Xmas gifts for the baby-boomers on your list."
4,"If you hear the song I sing, you must understand.","This box set is devoted to the San Francisco rock music scene of the second half of the 1960s. It comes in a hardcover book filled with lots of information, plus beautiful photographs of the performers. The four CDs feature music by performers both well known (Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane) and obscure (Public Nuisance, The Ace of Cups). The vast majority of the songs featured here will be unknown to most listeners. Not every song is great, but most of them are quite enjoyable. This set is well worth getting for fans of '60s rock music."
3,Thin Overview,"I'm not sure what the purpose is of this box set. There was so much music, by all these bands, that to throw some of it in a box, as if it belonged together, does a disservice to the music, musicians and the era it proposes to commemorate. The common denominator might be San Francisco but there was great diversity with-in the scene. That's what made Frisco in the '60's great. I can't fault the music but I think it distorts a picture that has never been taken. This box set,as good as it might be,does not begin to tell the tale it advertises on the box."
3,Nostalgia,"Pop music has come a looong way---if this set is anything to go by, very few 60's bands knew how to play an instrument!Still, this music is powerfully evocative of a certain place and time, and I imagine a lot of people old enough to remember the Summer of Love (or some that wish they'd been there) will enjoy it very much. The four CDs (be warned, the sound quality is all over the place) are housed in a huge book, with lots of interesting commentary and plenty of pics (bands may not have known how to play, but they sure knew how to dress)."
1,'PREDATOR completist.',"As an avid fan of the 'PREDATOR' films, I have to say I was extremely disappointed in McFarlane's attempt at both 'Scar' and 'Celtic' Predator. Neither truly resembled the hunters from the film. A generic paint job, Followed by nearly static posing is simply not worth the resale value of these guys. What was equally--If not more disappointing was the exclusive 'Stealth Predator' released as part of the 'AvP' line. Nothing more than the 'Celtic' Predator molded with clear plastic, This figure offered little as far as compensation for McFarlane's seemingly endless blunders as far as 'PREDATOR' was concerned. I'd LOVE to see NECA take a turn at producing the 'AvP' Predators. Maybe even a resculpt of Wolf from 'AvP:R'."
5,My Predator Toy Review,This toy is awesome it totally resembles the predator from the movie it is cool and fun
4,Keeps most of the litter contained,"I bought this to do what it is designed for, keep litter in front of the box and not all over my floor. I have one cat and even though I vacume the thing once a week it still lets a few litter granuals past. For the most part I am happy with it though, it was a great deal."
1,A bath towel works better...,I did not like the mat. The litter still goes all over the place. A large bath towel holds the litter better than this mat. Unfortunately this is a waste of money.
3,Bernie Goes Agatha,"Book antiquarian and friendly burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr goes chasing a rare edition of Chandler's The Big Sleep, inscribed to Dashiell Hammett, accompanied by his lesbian dog stylist friend Carolyn, and Raffles the cat. Soon they find themselves caught up in a regular Agatha Christie-a-like English manor who-dunnit plot, thin as a white sheet of paper, but thoroughly enjoyable and often quite funny. Rhodenbarr is a charming acquaintance. A good read, although hardly memorable."
1,"I tried and tried, but gave up at page 90","This was the first book of the series I have read -- well, I should say attempted to read since I didn't make it to page 100. It wasn't funny enough for me to follow as a pure satire on Agatha Christie. But the biggest problem is, I just grew tired of waiting for something to happen. The first 80 pages could have been condensed to 10 without losing any of the plot. It seemed like Block was on too much of a leisurely vacation with this one."
3,"Good Comedy, not his best mystery","While sometimes some of the entries in Lawrence Block's Burglar series can be a bit formulaic (some of the scenes are virtual repeats, at times), this one is a parody of other authors' prior, classic mystery works. Block's characters are simply a riot. The plot has a few flaws, but the emphasis here is on comic mystery not purity. So, if you are looking for a hard boiled or serious mystery, read Block's Scudder series or an Agatha Christie. There is fun in this book and two great quotes for my collection: ""Whenever a politician answers a question that you haven't asked, he's lying"" on page 282; and ""I don't know who picked you to be the head wallaby in this kangaroo court"" on page 303. However, this is not, IMHO, his best Burglar/Rhodenbarr book. Try ""The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams"" or ""The Burglar in the Closet."" Still, I'd recommend reading them all as light entertainment, somewhat similar to Block's Tanner/pseudo-spy series."
2,"Lame, lame, lame","Lawrence Block is a very good writer, usually. This ""mystery"" is chockablock with padded dialog that often seems to go on endlessly and to no purpose. And, to top it off, the ""mystery"" ends on a totally unbelievable and silly note.There were four bodies total, that is people ""killed"" or otherwise departed from this realm of tears. Three were explained at the end, and the other one was simply left hanging, the explanation being that, well, some things just cannot be explained. Gimme a break.That, on top of the bloated dialog, makes this one of Block's lesser efforts, to put it mildly."
4,WHAT A HOOT!,"This was my first 'Burglar' experience. In fact, I got the audio for my ride back and forth to work. It took a while but I got into the story pretty fast. Witty dialogue. Bernie and Carolyn were an interesting 'couple'. I loved the similarity to ""And Then There Were None' (a black and white film that was the best version - look for it in your video store), Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler. Altho there were some discouraging reviews I will try another Lawrence Block 'Burglar' soon. With all the air travel that I do, I may just get another audio and block out reality for a while enroute."
4,Humorous Lawrence Block,"Lawrence Block is a joy to read. Whenever I feel the need to escape, I pick up a Bernie Rhodenbarr book. And since I'm a cat lover, I especially like that he keeps his cat Raffles in every book of the series. Reading the humorous events of a burglar from the burglar's standpoint is quite refreshing. And stealing only from the rich, I guess makes him a modern-day Robin Hood. I have read all the Rhodenbarr books, but the Burglar in the Library is one of my favorites. I also have listened to other books by Block on tape and CD during long drives. He never ceases to amuse me."
2,Unknowingly ordered wrong. My fault.,"I misunderstood the description, and ordered the wrong thing. Everything else was great. I just didn't realize I had ordered wrong till after I had opened them. I ""needed"" the whole alphabet A - Z in one box. Found exactly what I needed locally at Staples. I guess I should have checked local first. ."
5,Magnificent!,"A japanese anime soundtrack as good as this one should not be missed. Plenty of piano scores that will keep you reliving the moments from the Someday's Dreamers series. The scores are a perfect blend to the series. It's not just any classical music soundtrack, but it's more than just a normal one too. A must buy item for someone who love musical scores."
1,dive rings,"Very disappointed. None of the rings sinks. They all floated. 1 broke the 1st day. The white plastic part were coming off, so I had to super glue them. If I could, I would give it a zero."
4,decentt,These rings serve their purpose; they stay upright after sinking to the bottom of the pool. The only small issue I had was that these were not as big as I was expecting!
1,Simply INcredible,"This book deserves 5 stars for bias and no stars for truth. It not only distorts the facts, it is a downright littany of unfair misrepresenations. For example, when the author quotes and then proceeds to legitimize Benito Mussolini's (of all balanced world leaders!) calling Vladimir Jabotinsky a ""fascist,"" something must be inverted in his thinking. Jabotinisky was a talented journalist and deep thinker. The author, in a frighteningly messianic tone, describes Ben-Gurion, who, in truth, was a career politician, who ruthlessly erradicated his opponents to satisfy his insatiable hunger to become Israel's first Prime Minsiter. In addition to the many misspellings of foreign names and a haunting sense of unchecked facts, this book was a disappointment, to say the least."
5,White hores is the right horse,"I've had this song in my head since the day i first heard while in a dance club back in the mid-eighties. Now it's been years since I heard it and finally I decided I really needed to track the song down and make it mine. To my disapoitment it's out of print. Once this makes it back onto the market, if ever, you really need to latch on to it. Crazy good beat and great example of eighties dance music at its best."
5,A fantastic jazz guitar CD!,"To appreciate this record, if you dig jazz guitar, just sit back and listen. Bireli's technical mastery is amazing, his intrepretive skills and homage to Frank are incredible. Opposed to some other reviews here, I really liked Bireli's singing because (IMO) he was doing it to honor Sinatra, as opposed the POV that Bireli was being self-indulgent. Plus he can sing. The rest of the band is extremely talented and tight and the improvising excellent and in line with each songs' intent. This CD is one of my top 5 jazz guitar CD's and I have about 1000 CD's (many of them from Amazon btw, many thanks!). Hope you like it!"
4,Some disassembly required...,"These just arrived today, got them for my '02 camaro since I'm detaching the stock ones anyway for some other repairs. To install these you re-use the metal shell from the stock mounts and get rid of the factory rubber bits, just a little time with a drill and blowtorch.Will update later if there are problems with the fit.Oh, and ordering one gets you two of the inserts... (would have been good info)"
1,Horrible,This software product is unusable to the everyday consumer. It is not user friendly. The instruction booklet is clear but actually using the software is more difficult.
1,CHAPPELLE SUCKS!,"I'm really 20 years old and I hate Dave Chappelle with a passion. Not one joke of his has made me laugh, considering the fact that most of them have to do with racism. If you use the same concept over and over again, it starts to get old! Maybe if I were born African American, I might've enjoyed it but I'm just some average caucasian guy who'd rather watch, ""Saturday Night Live"" or ""Mad TV"". In addition, I'm getting sick of the quote, ""I'm Rick James, b*tch!"" It's not one bit in the least funny! It's just retarded! Dave Chappelle should go smoke dope with another coke head who I really despise: George W. Bush!"
3,Please enter a title for your review,"Chappelle's skits all the follow the same formula, the juxtaposition of two opposing concepts, with one of the concepts more often than not being some representation of ""urban"" culture. It's crowdpleasing because he tells you the punchline of each skit before it starts so you know exactly what to expect. Give any comedian any of Chappelle's tired improv-class premises and they'd execute the skit just as well."
5,The best DVD I'll ever own......,"I love the Chappelle Show, and I love this DVD set!It even had my grandma and grandpa laughing their behinds off!I, along with everybody else who admires Chappelle, give him credit for being bold and wildly funny. He isn't afraid to cross the line, and it has paid off. He has successfully made the funniest show on television."
5,Dave Chappelle is hilarious!,"I LOVE CHAPPELLE'S(and i'm white). I don't care if people find it offensive, it's just hilarious. I can't wait for this box - set to come out. Keep it up comedy central(and Dave!)."
3,A Letdown....,"Ok, so let me get this straight, Chappelle's Show is pretty funny. But by funny, I'd put it on the same level as most other comedies out there. I was expecting to laugh all the way through this DVD based on what people had said about how good it was- it wasn't.There were some skits where I didn't laugh at all. There are some hilarious ones though, my favorite being Dave's mock R. Kelly song, 'I Wanna Pee on You.' Still got that one stuck in my head... However, there are only so many""'I'm Rick James, bi**h!'s"" I can take.I guess this DVD is a decent buy, if you enjoy Chapelle's sense of humor... I'm glad that I watched my friends copy though, as I don't think it's worth the $20 it would have cost me."
5,Another Black Comedian? - Hell NO!,"DC started out as a not so funny comedian but overnight,seems to have become a Powerhouse in home entertainment. I guess someone needed to fill the void left by Seinfeld and guess who happened to be in the neighbourhood?I remember DC in Nutty Professor. The thing is He made the movie funny all by himself. I love DC's style of comedy, and it's definitely not for minors(without a sense of humor!)Since Chappelle moved into primetime, people just started laughing again. He reminds me of a young black jerry lewis without the Hoivin Foivin..."
5,Classic!,I miss Dave. Maybe someday we can see more of his insanity on a weekly basis. I used to love to listen to him on Stern and he was always on top of his game and his show was off the chain. I would buy anything that he puts out on video.
3,Censorship takes more than one form.,"I'm rather put off that this set is missing many of the music performances from the ends of the shows.The front of the DVD says Chappelle's Show Season One Uncensored. From this title, one should be able to conclude that the package is Season One Plus (plus the words no longer bleeped out)....not Season One Plus and Minus. The only reason I can imagine the song sequences are missing is because someone (Paramount?) would not fork over the money needed to secure these performances for DVD release. Truly disappointing."
3,"very funny show, but...","ign.com said that many of the episodes are only 16 minutes long, compared to the standard 22. it is even shorter if your not a big fan of rap, which is on at the end of pretty much every episode. if all you are looking for is good laughs, then this is a good show to see, but getting the dvd might not be neccessary with all of the re-runs on tv."
5,There's a reason it's always sold out. Order it now!,"I've been a fan of Dave Chappelle since Half Baked. I've seen him live and I saw the HBO special. His show is without question one of the top three sketch comedies on television.Alot has been made about how it's racist or how he gets away with using the ""n word"", but when I see a show like ""Banzai"" being advertised during this show, you just have to realize that shows like this are out there, some of them are just funnier. This is one of the funnier ones.The skits are fresh, original, and most importantly, even-handed. Dave doesn't discriminate when it comes to knocking on a race. Tyrone, the black crackhead would have gotten pretty much any other show on television off the air, and I think that's an important indication of how strong the show itself is.Granted, the second season so far has been far superior, but the first season was still better than at least 90% of the stuff that is on TV."
3,"GOOD, BUT....","am i the only one who realizes he had a BEST OF episode in his first season? is it just me or is this pathetic? the show may be funny but he puts no effort into making new episodes that are quality. the same skits are repeated in different ways over and over, and i'm sure at the end of this season he'll pop out yet another 'best of' episode which includes 4 charlie murphy skits. not to mention lil' jon repeatedly being mocked in skits, which by the way is absolutely NOT funny. Put. Some. Effort. Out. everyone loves the show and gives it five stars, so i felt i would point out the main reasons this show is going to die within two years. he just doesnt try. I win. Game....blouses."
1,Entertain DON'T DEGRADE!!!,"I want to start by saying I think dave chappelle is a very talented comedian, simply because he's a natural.The question is what is entertainment and what is offensive?.I understand the fact that it is comedy but at who's expense.I find any form of entertainment insulting that disrespects people of any race or culture and this show did that.I watched a couple of episodes when it first aired and my opinion of the show was God awful writing,ignorant slapstick,wasted talent of what could have been one of the greats.I just want say on a personal note to chapplle you really need to be ashamed of yourself,you came off as a bafoon and who has embarrassed and lost your people(YOU MAKE IT HARD!!!)"
3,and also.,"HOW can dave chappelle have the best show ever? people posting their reviews saying its the best show ever. He has 12-15 episodes out. some with repetitive skits. how can this be the best show ever? snl has been out for what, 20 years, and though it may not be quite as 'good' now, that doesnt make chappelle show better. this show is about 17 minutes of show, with maybe 5 of him talkin about his skits, and another 5 with horrible skits such as lil' jon (how can someone find this funny?). i agree that the show is good, but come on people its been out for a year or so, and its the best ever? please go watch the simpsons. family guy. futurama. chappelle show is not the best show on tv....in fact, daily show is better. ok i'm done forever. dont love a show for 12 episodes. show some respect for things that are good"
1,"season 1 is terrible, season 2 is great","title says it all...i bought the first and second season on dvd and i was shocked for two reasons:1. the first season is not funny in the slightest2. the second season is really funnydont bother wasting your time on season 1, the black white supremacist on ep1 is kinda funny...the matrix spoof is kinda funny...that's it. just 2 sorta funny moments in 4 hours or so. don't waste your time like i did. i guess they went out and hired some good comedy writers for season two though because there is some comedy gold in there: eddie murphy's brother, rick james, lil jon, etc."
3,"GOOD, BUT..","am i the only one who realizes that this comedian puts no effort into his show? who has a BEST OF episode in their first season? what the F? and as far as the 2nd season is concerned, he puts no effort into it. by the end, he'll have a best of season 2 episode that includes 4 charlie murphy skits and 3 lil' jon crap skits. No. Effort. At. All. i feel that since everyone is giving him 5 stars cuz they love the show, that someone needs to speak the obvious and say this show is the same repetitive lack of trying skits. Funny, but no where near great. a lot of shock value humor, and he isnt even trying in the 2nd season. this show will die by season 4. i win. Game. Blouses."
2,"Has its moments, but much too racist","It never ceases to amaze me how people who get upset about white-on-black racism think it's perfectly OK when the roles are reversed. They're either being ignorant or incredibly patronizing to blacks.Chappelle is certainly capable of raising a grin when a skit clicks, but the show relies too much on the kind of crudeness that suggests a target audience of middle-school-age boys. And when you add in his obvious dislike of white people, it's just not worth the effort... at least if you're white yourself."
1,Horrible,and I don't get all the Hype about Him at all.He is like a Poor Man' Chris Rock on a Good day at best.He is vastly overrated IMO.
5,Brilliant.,"This show is hillarious. This is one of the only shows that I will just DIE laughing EVERY episode.Our society needs a show like this, his use of the ""N-Word"", and being politically incorrect is really a change to most shows, which are usually so up-tight.Simply hillarious."
5,Amazing!!!,"The first season of the Chappelle show was simply genius. I believe he has what it takes to overtake Chris Rock as the funniest comedian of our time. Great comedy like this is rare nowadays. This is a time when ""comedy"" is represented by some teen pervert making love (for prohibition of better words) to a pie. I do find that sort of thing funny, but it is by no means true comedy, raunchy yes but it still takes a genius (Chappelle) to elaborate and make the sketches great. For crying out loud, his Rick James sketch was seen only 2-3 weeks ago and everybody I know is saying ""I'm Rick James b...."" There is even T-shirts for sale already. I'm glad this was released. I was actually considering having to buy a dvd burner to download the shows and burn them. Thank you for releasing this and not making a ""pirate"" out of me!"
5,"Funny, Funny, Funny",I'm a huge fan of the show and I'm glad that the 1st season is out on DVD. I really like the fact that Dave Chappelle is bold enough to say things that no else would and at the same time make you laugh out loud.This is the best comedy DVD that has come out in a long time and comedy fans should definitely get it.
5,"Funny,In your Face. Short lived sadly.","Chapelle's show Season 1 Dvd set. - I find it very funny, Although I can't stand the usual stereotypes of The Reagan/Bush Admin and the little Republican jabs. I find it hilarious, in your face and overall Typical Chappelle, It's too bad he had to sell out and go ""find himself"" . whatever that means."
1,Audio dies in the first minute.,Amazon needs to fix this episode. The audio drops out in the first minute and doesn't come back. I hope it is fixed. It would be a shame if they don't fix the problem.
4,"INCREADIBLE, But Not all Musical Guests.","Chappelle's Show, is easily the best sketch comedy show to come around since ""the state"" or ""kids in the hall"". Its writing is impecable, and it is very edgy and brave. It doesn't shy away from issues of race and stereotypes. However, the only reason this gets 4 and not 5 stars, is because it does not feature all the musical guest performances, with were some of the best live hip-hop performances ever. Hopefully they will at least include the Blackstar performance, because Mos Def is a good friend of Daves. Ah well, it's certainly worth the price for the comedy sketches alone, but having all the musical guest intact, would have put it over the edge."
3,Season 1 lacks in laughs!!,"I purchased the season 1 dvd because this season, the show is hilarious. But I was a bit disappointed with last season. There are about 6 episodes that were really funny. I love the mad real world, the r. kelly music video (you know which one), blackzilla, the blind white supremacist, and trading spouses. The rest were mediocre at best. The audio commentary with dave chapelle is actually very funny, but are in only 5 episodes.I do not recommend you get this dvd, because you think season 2 is great. I will definitely be anticipating season 2 dvd because so far all of the episodes are hilarious."
3,dull towards the end,"Season 1 starts off great but as your progress to disc 2, the skits get awfully boring, insanely unfunny, offensive in a bad way (the cancer kid playing video games with Dave...come on, just BAD), and way too long. Even the crack addict skits aren't funny anymore. It seems as if something went wrong towards the end of the first season. Is that why Dave disappeared for a while? However this set is worth its cost for the Clayton Bigbsy skit. That is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my life."
5,THE FUNNIEST EVER!,"Dave Chappelle is a fool! My husband and I had countless hours of laughs while watching this. If you love good comedy, this is a must buy! You'll definitely enjoy the R. Kelly comedy sketches. Dave Chappelle should be commended on his ingenius ideas and outlook on life....and some of the bumps along the way."
3,"Funny, but wears thin.","This show is unabashedly crude and broad -- which Chappelle acknowledges by having a choir sing the playground standard, ""The Diarrhea Song"" -- but it is funny, and some of the parodies and sketches hit the target, especially his version of THE REAL WORLD, and his ANTWONE FISHER-styled autobiography.Whether or not you'll actually want to re-watch all the potty and pee-pee jokes after viewing them once or twice is another matter. The skits tend to go longer than necessary, repeating themselves, and the relentlessly crude humor becomes numbing at DVD length, sorta like the SOUTH PARK DVDs."
3,This can't be the only black guy making comedy.,"Ok ok. Chappelle is played out. Overrated. The stuff on here really isn't all that. Stuff is funny when it is. I just think people are just so excited theres a new black comedian making a show, they assume its the best stuff ever. This will never reach a certain level though. I think this is the best this is gonna get. This goes for Season 2 also. Nothing groundbreaking here. Definately overrated. I was watching something on HBO last night (some stand-up stuff), some guy ended his act by saying ""I'm Rick James bit**"", the audiences reaction was insane. The whole time the guy was telling jokes they never laughed as hard as when he said that last line. I think its all phony. People are programmed to think this is the best. I'm tired of it. Not saying its bad though, I just had enough of this dude. NEXT"
2,A So-called Man of Color Makin' it Happen,"True, I'm about as white as a (gulp, middle-aged) woman comes. I burn very easily and use a strong UVA/UVB sunscreen (unite!). I have been called honky and ofay many times in my years (how many? I'll never cave in!). But I have become a fan of this Chappelle's Show despite the above confessional. I think that Mr. Chappelle has a definite racial bias towards darker pursuations, but darned if the sketches aren't funny enough to make spittle fly out of chapped lips. I use a good lip balm but it isn't enough to keep the skin from cracking."
4,A very funny show if you are open minded,Chappelle's show is funny if you are not an Overly sensitive person. there are way to many sensitive people. this show is for all races to watch and basicly laugh at ourselves in good humor. Alot of the skits are race stereotype based but that's what makes it so funny. that's the point its humor about ourselves magnified.Also the Amazon video quality is good.
3,buy season 2 first,"season 1 doesn't have the more common skits, so i'd buy season 2 first, then add this to your dave chappelle collection later."
5,THIS IS SOME OF THE FUNNIEST TELEVISION EVER!,I recommend the DVD set to anyone with a sense of humor! This is some hilarious TV here! The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some extras on this must buy set.
4,Get it while you can,"How can you go wrong with one of the most messed up m-effers in comedy. Everything he does is golden. If you are PC, don't bother here. This is off the wall funny, but if you take offense at the drop of a hat, steer clear grandma."
2,Incomplete,"I loved the show, don't get me wrong, but I feel cheated by the collection given it did not include all the musical acts that made the show so great to watch. Apparently, even the iTunes versions don't have any of the musical acts in them as well. Shame, shame..."
2,Basic Darkroom Technique DVD Too Basic!,"This is MUCH too simplistic a video. It is for someone who has NEVER been in a darkroom. I know that it does have ""Basic"" in the title, but really, this is just too basic. It is quite boring to actually watch, in fact, I fell asleep twice during attempts to watch it. Sorry guys, but don't waste your money. Visit a friend who actually has a darkroom, or buy a basic book instead."
5,Used again and again.,"Like the previous reviewer, I agree that the book is very much a catalog and not a tool for teaching. But I have to stress that if you love to decorate cakes and are looking for new ideas and what is current in the cake decorating world, than this is a book for you. I have looked at the book countless of times, and it has lots of ideas for holidays, baptisims, wedding, graduation etc. It is a really nice book to look at, I can't tell you how many times I have used this book as a source."
3,"Loved the first half, hated the second","I would give the first half of this book 5 stars and the last half only 2 stars. I loved the characters and the events that led them to the planet. Their predicament was extremely intriguing! But their underwater exploration and discovery of the ""godbits"" bogged down the whole narrative. It read like a ""psychedellic trip"" gone bad."
2,It does not fit at all,"Looking at the construction of this goggle, I think it is designed with one kind of face in mind. There is no margin at all for the nose area. You have to have a tall nose bridge, which it uses with a very small gasket to seal. I would imagine even if it fits, there's a good chance it will be uncomforable. And the rest of the face need to be relatively narrow. Looks like they justed use 1 face model don't know how to widen it's shape compatibility."
5,Killer Dillers,"The only movie review guide to compare with Apel's work is ""Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide,"" which boasts more than 20,000 entries, and naturally by the sheer volume presents more chaff than wheat. I don't know about you, but I don't expect to live long enough or have the time to use all that information, whereas ""Killer B's"" has only 237 reviews of films, all of which are recommended; hence, you get all wheat and no chaff."
5,So Sweet and Relaxing,I love the book and tape. I listened to it all the time when I was a kid back in the 80's. It would put me to sleep in a heart beat. I loved every single song and I still remember most of the words. I had the tape until a couple of days ago when my two year old daughter got a hold of it and ruined it. I hope I'm able to find another one for her and I to enjoy together. I had just recently found it and hadn't even got to play it for her yet. If I do find one I'll make sure it stays way out of her reach. I wish it wasn't out of production I'd buy one for every kid in the family.
1,How can anyone defend the electoral college in this day and age?,"The author of this book is either an obscurantist or an elector himself, but my guess is on the former. There is no need for an electoral college in this day of mass media. The electoral college is archaic, aristocratic and undemocratic - how can anyone defend an establishment such as that?"
5,Review of Beanie Babies Freezie,"These toys were to replace 2 that were lost on a trip with my 7 yr. old granddaughter. Her heart was broken, and your fast service with the beautiful new ""Freezies"" - ""Freezie 1 and Freezie 2"" made her (and me) very happy. Thank you for the great service!"
4,Great Product!!,"I recieved this as a gift, and the only reason I gave it a 4 was because, they left out the boneing knife- I can get that later.It looks fantastic on the counter.I used it immediatly, and I was so impressed with the product- I used 3 out of the set. They were wonderful!!This is not a set for the ""Chef"", but definatly a good product for the everyday household- actually, better than that!Buy this for yourself, a great product, or get it as a gift for someone else. You cannot go wrong!!!This is my edit after a year, I hate the sharpening wand that came with this. I had to buy a good stone!"
3,Chicago is Sharp!,This is the best deal for your money. The knives are probably one of the few economical knives out there that are always very SHARP. Their lightweight construction makes them easy to use. Make sure you wipe dry the knives each and every tome you wash them by hand (Never put them in the dishwasher!) good bang for you buck!
4,"Good knife set, just a few caveats","I have been using these knives for several months, and I enjoy using them. Just be aware that they are NOT made of stainless steel, as is almost every knife in the world is made of today. For some reason, the immediate universe of knife manufacturing, decided to switch over to stainless steel. I don't like stainless steel. It doesn't seem to hold an edge as long as carbon steel and stainless takes a bit more effort to sharpen. Just my humble opinion. Carbon steel does rust, but I wash all of these knives by hand and immediately wipe them dry. No problem. I never need to oil.I am not a big fan of machine washing any knife. It is tough to seat them in the racks so they will not rub against something and the amount of heat used to dry does a number on the hardware holding the handles on.My only gripe is that the blades are fairly thin and don't have a lot of heft to them. Otherwise, they work well. Good but not exceptional.Hope that helps."
2,RUST!!!! (and lots of it),"One washing set the rust in motion. Consumer reports dropped the ball on this one. They claim stainless steel, yet a magnet clings to these knives like they were pure iron ore! Garbage, unless immediatly after use, u wash, dry, and oil them. I'll pass, and return them in a hurry."
3,These knives are a very good value.,"For the price you would be very hard pressed to find a better set of knives than these. They are not the highest quality, but the price is right and they will do the job.Regarding the CR rating and dishwashing: Don't put your knives in the dishwasher. It doesn't matter what the box says. CR even says this in their article. It's not that difficult to wipe your knives down and dry them immediately after use. Just get into the habit."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great","This knife set is O.K. For the price I would say it is a fair value. I have had it for about a month and one of the knives is already starting to rust. I have never put them in the dishwasher, and recommend that you don't. They are very sharp and feel nice. They also look nice in the block. Not a bad set, but don't expect to be blown away."
4,Good Product - but please notice these are VEGETARIAN capsules,"Good Product, also recommended by my Doctor.However, please note when buying this product these are VEGETARIAN capsules, with a daily recommended dose of 9 pills. I thought I was buying a higher quantity (270 capsules) of the normal capsules, but in fact these vegetarian capsules are equal to the same 30 day supply in the non-vegetarian 180 capsule bottle, with a daily recommend dose of 6 pills."
5,nice for the price,Nice strong plastic fit really nice and looks a lot better than the metal ones and easy slides to close and open well worth $6
5,"Pondering labor, agricultural, & environmental issues","Collaboratively compiled and edited by Timothy A. Wise, Hilda Salazar and Laura Carlsen, Confronting Globalization: Economic Integration And Popular Resistance In Mexico presents informed and informative essays from a variety of expert contributors pondering diverse labor, agricultural, and environmental issues within the context of contemporary globalization. Looking at the social and environmental costs that globalization extracts upon Mexico's land and people; exploring grassroots searches for alternate paths; and ranging from sweatshop workers' struggles for basic labor rights to the efforts of corn farmers to keep the influx imported grain from forcing them off their land, Confronting Globalization is very highly recommended reading for students of international economics, social activists, and governmental trade policy makers."
3,Average for Hagberg,"David Hagberg is one of the best thriller writers out there but this is his so-so average effort. It concerns the search for an ex-Stasi Captain, who based in his gorilla compound in Montana, tries to find one of Nazi's deadliest weapons ever created and use it to bring terror into the world. Against him is Bill Lane, who will try to stop him and prevent the world from facing this threat. Very fast and very average with weak character development."
1,Not so Good,"The plot of this book is weak and very slow to develop. There was very little development of the characters thus they lacked depth. I stopped reading half way, which is further than I got with Hagberg's ""Joshua's Hammer"". I would not recommend this book."
2,the plug is too small for my blackberry so i can't use it,"I have no idea if the headset works because it does not fit my phone even though the ad said it works with blackberrys, so I had to buy one with a larger plug at Frys and still have the 2 i bought from you in the package, just not sure how to return them or if I can"
4,Decent.,"This was the exact item I purchased from Verizon for much more $$$. I liked it, so I bought a backup for my laptop bag. On my Samsung Fascinate, however, there is no functioning mute button. When my husband used it with his Blackberry, he said the button (on the earpiece) functioned as a mute button. For me, it hangs up the call. BUT it works well, has great sound quality, and is the most comfortable earpiece I've ever used."
3,"cheap, convenient, not for audiophiles.","Sound quality is poor, but it's loud enough. Very uncomfortable due to seam in plastic holder. However filing or cutting it away solves the problem, makes it almost as comfortable as the similar earphone with weaker rubber ""clip"" that Plantronics sadly no longer sells. Note that Model 200 lacks the one-touch answer button that the similar MX203 has. They work with the Treo and Cento."
2,Not as good as the previous model,"I had the version of this earpiece before this one, but lost it and had to replace it. I don't know why Plantronics changed the form, but this model doesn't seem as snug in my ear as the old one. I think it has something to do with the rubber clamp for your earlobe. Otherwise, it works just fine."
1,Architecture,This product is horrible since it only imitate another well known product but absolutely horrible since it keeps fall out of my ear and the audio is barely audible. I wish I would test it out right away and return it before the time for it expires! Horrible product! Wish it was long enough so I could at least try to use it as a leash for my dog gumbo! Right now it sits in the corner of the house as an eye sore! What a rip off! Would get this item again even if it were free!!!! Would rate this as a NEGATIVE 5 Star but since none is available...I am giving it a 1*! CAVEAT EMPTOR: If you like to be ripped off...go ahead and buy this product!DDS
2,"Sound coming in is good, going out crummy!","I bought this as a trial for someone else. So I have several to compare it to. The ""clip"" on the ear is evidently made for someone other than my size and shape of ear. It is not comfortable, nor does it keep it firmly in my ear.The sound coming from the other party is fine, just a little softer than the average earphone. The special mic which is supposed to reduce wind noise evidently reduces your voice with no wind noise. To attain the same pickup as say a Jabra c500, you would have to tape the microphone to your bottom lip. Needless to say, the person I talked to kept asking me to speak up. I bought two of these to check out and they both performed the same sad way.So if you want to hold the mic to your lips, get this unit. If you want both hands free, don't try it."
4,Doesn't fit all blackberry phones!,"I bought this to go with my blackberry pearl 8130 and it did not fit in the jack so I had to buy a 3mm adaptor. It's pretty good, gets good reception. I wanted this because I hate the blue tooth headsets."
4,Great!!!!,I have tried several headsets and this one has been the most comfortable. I have a little trouble getting it set in the ear but once it is set it is great and does not fall out.
5,Nothing Compares,"Aramaic-Hebrew-English DictionaryEzra Zion Melamed is the best scholar when it comes to Aramaic and the Talmud. Every one of his many books, mostly in Hebrew has become a classic. This dictionary is far more than a dictionary in Aramaic-Hebrew-English. It is a compendium of much of the wisdom of the Rabbinic Sages of yore. The list of sayings encompasses the best that the Sages of Israel have passed down to subsequent generations. I highly recommend this book and any other book by E. Z. Melamed."
3,lot's of fun - hard to do well on,"My 9yo daughter and I, 60yo, enjoyed this game a lot- but we both had trouble advancing through the different skill levels.I saw a review that said they went through entire thing in 5 hrs. So there must be some pretty spectacular players out there.We aren't at that level and wish there was a way to make it more compatible with our skill level so we could play it more."
3,Great for young kids that want to pretend to surf,"I bought this for my 7-year-old and he loves it... as does my 4-year-old. They can be a couple of the characters from the Surfs Up movie and they can't really fail at the surfing.The premise is good. The main controls are intuitive. However, to do a surfing trick is a matter of button pressing which is unfortunate since surfing tricks could be mimicked with controller moves on the wii.We haven't gone through many levels yet. The newness has worn off for them and the level advances haven't lured them back.If you live near a beach, spend the money on a used board.. or boogie board and go learn about real waves instead.. but if you have the extra cash, this can keep a kid excited about the ocean.Oh.. that reminds me... Endless Ocean for the Wii is a must for any adult or kid that wants to explore the ocean!"
4,Based on a true story,This is the first film for the director and based on a true story he heard while at sleepaway camp in north florida. The H man is a legendary figure in the old boy scout camp grounds in north florida. Did a crazed man attack and kill several campers for one terror filled summer?
4,a lot covered in a little space,"This book was recommended by ""chop-doc"" Jeanne P. First published in 1963, I believe, it was written by well-respected trumpet artist and coach Harold Mitchell. Within the space of 88 pages, Book 1 covers a lot of territory, addressing most of the difficulties a new trumpet student encounters and stressing the discipline needed to master the instrument. Unlike similar books, containing only etudes and exercises, Mitchell offers helpful advice on executing the material on every page."
3,Close only counts in horseshoes....,"While the book does succeed in providing many sample questions to get you in a testing frame of mind, the answer key is occasionally wrong and self contradictory. If you aren't working with Netware day to day you may not spot these gotchas. Don't rely on this book as your only test prep text. You will need something else to explain the correct answers to you!p.s. - To see an error in the book for yourself, compare the answers for Section 1 Q&A problem #13 and Sample Test question #4."
2,Don't rely on this alone....,I was just looking for cna testing guides. I ended up just getting a copy of a novell course book and returned this book instead. You'd do better if you just bought testing software from bigred testing.
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY -- BUY ANOTHER BOOK NOT THIS ONE,"This book is severely lacking. There are tons of mistakes. You read a chapter, try to do the sample questions, only to find out the information on the questions is NO WHERE to be found in the text. I bought it as a supplement to a computer based training CD that I purchased for $1,200--and I can only say thank god I wasn't completely cheap and only bought the book because I would have wasted my time and money studying for the exams with only this book. I would recommend only borrowing it from someone as a supplement to either a class, CBT or VBT format. I like the questions, though. There are a lot of them and they were helpful."
2,Too many errors!,"Seems as if this book was written between morning coffee and lunch. It is full of errors. I am nowhere near a network guru, but I found many errors in the sample tests. The text portion does not nearly cover what is in the sample tests, but then, this book is apparently geared solely for practicing tests. Also, while some of the multiple choice questions have to be answered in letters, the answers at the end of the book are given in numbers. Not really a big thing, but is just one more thing pointing to the haphazard manner this book was put together."
2,Wanted: Proof readers with Netware experience,"As the title says, this book is a testing guide. The text is brief & the focus is on the questions at the end of each section. With such an emphasis on the tests & quizes, you'd think someone with Netware experience would've taken the time to proof-read those questions. It seemed as if 1 person wrote the text, more than 1 person wrote the questions, and no one with any Netware knowledge did any proof reading. My question is this, if you didn't already have knowledge of Netware, then how would you know that the tests in this Testing Guide were often wrong? The answer is that you wouldn't & when you took the actual Novell tests you'd be wrong & fail."
2,A good read - but outdated,"This book is profoundly outdated. The practice of law involves nowadays a lot more of technology, a lot more of sophisticating approach of the cases and a lot more of sharks in the sea to fight with.A good (but not great) read, a pretty good insight at how lawyers used to think.I would say it' s ok for a non-lawyer to buy and read this book, but I - as a lawyer -would go for a more modern read.Also note that this book talks about trial lawyers exclusively, so this is about a percentage of all lawyers, and i would say its for those who (used to) handle pretty big cases, so this has very little to day with the everyday practice of law.Also: the nations top litigators don' t really tell you how they win, they much more tell you how they ""won""."
2,Updated it please,"When there are a plenty of good books available, why bother to pay for a outdated one??? Is the author still active at trials? I"
2,No more brainstorming please!,"The truth is that the title of the book is attractive, especially in these times of crisis. But I think it focuses too much on the process of generating ideas to reduce costs by using the technique of brainstorming. Basically the whole model is that people generate ideas for reducing costs and the author presents some, but do not present a real and profound solution to the problem. I think the author is naive to think that only by bringing people together, training them and making them to generate ideas, we will achieve impressive results and high added value to the company.The model needs to be more structured and not so much process oriented.Believe me. If you use this model, may be people will be happy to be part of a team, participate in this meetings (working lunchs would be better) but no great impact will be created in making costs go down."
1,DOES NOT WORK AFTER THE 2ND BATTERY,THE FIRST BATTERY DID NOT WORK. IT WILL NOT TAKE A CHARGE. THEY SENT A REPLACEMENT BATTERY AND THE SAME THING. THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD PRE CHARGE THE BATTERY AND TEST IT. THEY DID NOT! THE FACTORY SEAL WAS STILL ON IT. I AM IN THE PROCESS OF RETURNING THE BATTERY NOW. NO GOOD. I HAVE READ ABOUT THESE OLDER BATTERIES HAVING PROBLEMS.
5,Thank You,I broke the part and didn't want to buy a new Cuisinart. Buying this part solved the problem.
1,Danger! Danger! Danger!,"Danger! Danger! Danger! We have a Cuisinart mini Prep and the blade broke at two rivet points, while chopping onions, smashed a hole in the container and flew across the room. Thank goodness our five and a half year old granddaughter wasn't with Grandma when this happened. This is a serious problem. I am very concerned about the safety of the users of this product. Yes! Cuisinart just suggests that you buy a new blade and bowl. This is a product safety issue. I have made a complaint to the Consumer Product Safety Commission! This product is a potential killer!!!!!!!!!"
2,Hazard - Cracked Blade,"WARNING SAFETY HAZARD! Check the underside of your Cuisinart DLC-861TX chopping blade after each use. Look for hairline cracks near the four rivets that hold the bottom blade. If you find any you might want to do as I did--immediately toss out a blade with a crack. My blade threw a small chunk of metal into the food. There is one online report of the blade coming off and breaking through the bowl. I called Conair (they own Cuisinart) and they said I had to pay postage if I wanted them to look at the failure and decide if they want to improve their design. I'm not impressed with their concern for product safety. Luckily we were not injured. Now, Cuisinart is on public notice about their potential hazard and you can protect yourself with routine inspections."
5,Very satisfied.,"Arrived in time and was the right product for the Cuisinart it was meant for, no mess ups. I could not be more satisfied."
5,Big kids & little kids love Mr.Bean,"I purchased Mr. Bean for my husband for Christmas. My 10 year old granddaughter saw the tape and fell in love with Mr.Bean. This summer when discussing Christmas, she said she was going to ask Santa to bring her a Mr. Bean just like Grandpas. Doesn't matter what age you are, Mr. Bean is enjoyed by all."
1,piece of garbage,"I repair computers for a living and I can honestly say that this is the worst piece of junk I've ever worked on. Everything is designed to be difficult to get at, Sony offers very little help or support or downloads on their website for the unit, and if it breaks down, the parts are about 5 times as expensive than any other computer out there. Its very heavy to move around, and in person it is quite ugly. It looks like something from the early 80's. Avoid this computer."
5,Great All-In-One Design Truly Ahead Of It's Time,We have owned this model for a number of years and it has been great. We still use it many hours every day both as a TV and as a PC. In fact it is the last remaining windows computer in the house because it works so well - every other PC has been swapped out for a Mac. My biggest fear is with the upcoming switch to digital TV by our cable company will render the TV unusable - only time will tell.I love the TV style remote and the ability to watch TV in a window while surfing the web. I am not aware of any comparable product today.
3,what's that song????,"i've been looking for the song that's playing when diane lane goes to the womans house and she's getting her portrait painted, there's this almost jazz sounding song, and i cant find it. please help!!!"
2,food food food,Lots of food references. The DVD was much more pleasing as it involved the landscapes and people who are very interesting to see more than the story line of the actual novel. A switch to find the movie better than the book
4,Ignore the previous entry,"Christophe Beck's compositions have about as much in common with Hans Zimmer and Brian Tyler as Tyler and Zimmer have to do with good taste. (If you didn't catch that, they're the lowliest of all musical hacks. Watered down washouts; answers for people who want cheap synth-rock-orchestra or ugly second-rate Goldenthal knockoff)Beck is an excellent composer - as his years on Buffy has shown. His score to this movie is both thematic, approachable and dense. I highly recommend it."
2,Lasted 18 months,"I bought this to do support 2 things -- battery backup for the Bluray player and the cable box -- a very light load. Our neighborhood gets lots of power flickers and having this happen when we're watching TV is a major pain.At the 18 month point (of a 36 month warranty) it started randomly shutting itself off. Items plugged into the surge-protector-only side still got power. Items plugged into the surge-protector-and-battery-backup side got ZERO power. It wasn't just that the battery stopped working, it's that it actively prevented connected components from working.I emailed Tripp Lite support and they said they'd replace the unit if I mailed it in first. I paid $11 for the mailing, but I figured it was still cheaper than buying another unit. Tripp Lite was pretty quick responding and they sent me a more powerful unit (550va) as a replacement."
2,Noisy,"When the power goes off, this product emits a series of 4 beeps every 10 seconds until the power comes back on. We couldn't stand the noise, turned it off after 10 minutes. Manufacturer says the beeps can't be turned off, try the BCPERS450."
1,battery backup stopped working in a month,"The Chinese-made battery in this unit failed in a few weeks after only providing a total of about thirty seconds of backup. I have had similar experiences with power tool and lantern battery replacements made in China; they provide only a fraction of the service time of the Japanese or American originals. I support dozens of cordless items from numerous manufacturers, and I've collected enough bad experiences to advise people to avoid Chinese-made rechargeable batteries when possible."
2,High failure rate,We purchased several of these for the school district I work for. We have only one personal computer hooked up to each of these UPS's. A number of them have failed throughout the district after only a year of use. I would suggest a different UPS as these seem to have a very high failure rate from what I have seen.
5,Yatming 1/18 Corvette Gs Roadster in Silver Blue,"I know there was never a red one,So I got the Silver Blue model,had the Chrome-ish wheels painted to match,and the model looks exquisite.It will rival any Grand Sport Roadster that exoto throws at you for triple the price,a Much less expensive Alternative to Exoto."
3,Could be a valuable reference,"OK, I bought this for my wife and we're still at the same income level we were at beforehand. This is not a get rich quick way of making a living. If you are willing to invest the time, money, and space required, this book can give you some valuable information."
1,cute but scratched,"i would have put a higher rate since it's cute, though a bit small for the size...and it came scratched on top! i just don't think returning it will do me good since it might cost me more doing so..."

1,Burning money would be better,"This is one of the shoddiest toys I've ever seen. Broke in multiple places on the second flight. Burn your money instead of buying this, at least that will generate a little heat."
2,Disappointing,This helicopter just about fell apart on me after 4 or more flights. A better choice of toy to get that flies would be a stomp rocket. It works better and is more durible compared to this toy.
3,Captain Miller's diary,Average civil war diary of company level officer. Most entries provide little more than two or three sentences to note the significant items of the day. Captain Miller spent a lot of time convening courts martial and less time with his company. Most notes indicate the efficiency or number of cases handled rather than the nature of the trials. Captain Miller was present at the Battle of Prairie Grove but merely lists the dead and wounded of his company to give an account of the largest battle his regiment fought in. Solid source of information for those interested in the 20th Wisconsin but light in entertaining the reader.
5,Fabulous,I got this for a present for someone who loves Tazo tea. I was a little unsure what they would like since I am not a tea drinking. I picked this because it had lots of choices. My friend LOVED it. Plus it got to me very quickly. Thanks! :)
4,Very helpful for patients and family,"As a person with bipolar disorder, I was looking for a book that I could give to members of my family so they could understand the illness and (its many variations) better. I also didn't want to scare them even though this is a scary illness. I found this book to be clearly written for people who do not have a medical background. It spelled issues out in an easy and understandable format with excellent examples and explanations. I have read many books on this illness looking for something to give my family, this is the book I will be giving them. I would recommend this book if you, a family member or friends suffers from this illness"
5,"A must have for family, friends, and sufferers of bipolar","This book is extrodinary in explaining biochemical as well as psychological markers of manic-depressive illness. Dr. Mondimore also discusses how to seek treatment, what treatment options are available, and the role of various medications you or your loved one might need. When my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years started displaying signs of an episode, this is the first book i bought. It is still a main staple in allowing us to understand various medications and how to work with doctors. It is the best book i've found and still we refer to it. A must have."
4,Best I've read so far,"Since my wife's diagnosis with BP last year, I have read several books on the subject. Mondimore's book so far has been the most comprehensive and up-to-date book of all of them. He presents a history of manic-depression, descriptions of symptoms, and discusses many medications and alternative treatments available. He presents some technical medical material in a manner that is clear and understandable."
5,Well Worth the Money,"This book was extremely informative, complete and easy to read. I highly recommend it to patients and families."
3,Great series - Badly planned DVD,I recently got this DVD and I love the series but feel that they could have done a much better job in releasing the DVD.It seems that none of the episodes have chaptering. That's not so great when an episode is just under 60 minutes. If you end up getting interrupted (as I always seem to do) you then have to start looking from the beginning of the episode for where you left off.There are no subtitles. This series is mostly in English but includes a lot of Spanish dialogue. Subtitles here in one or the other or both of those languages would be great. I speak English (y un pequeño espanol) but I would definately benefit from subtitles so that I can pick up the dialogue that goes by too quickly for me.I've got no complaints with the quality of the video transfer or the sound both are crisp and well done.
5,Smart and entertaining,"This series is as deep as it is entertaining. The cast is amazing, and the plot lines relevant and engaging. Themes of love, family, and conflict are woven throughout in a way that everyone can understand and relate to."
4,Building Strong Organizations,"D'Amour has done it again. With this book she builds upon ""How to Turn Generation Me into Active Members of Your Association"" and shows us how to recruit new members and keep them involved and satisfied enough to retain them. Her series is exemplary. I look forward to her next book."
1,How did they approve the printing of this???,"I didn't expect this book to be particularly great; it was 15AUD at a discount bookstore.From the start to the finish, mistakes in the captions; in one picture John is John, and in another he's Hillel. The layout and the whole packaging design is a little tacky, like something a high school student could have done with their hands tied behind their back.For me the only thing good thing is, it's better than printing out a whole bunch of RHCP pics to use as photo references for my art/drawings of them.Unless you want to waste your money on this, get 'Me and My Friends- Red Hot Chili Peppers' by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft instead. More up close and personal, with a great photographic history of the band."
2,Not Happy,"The book arrived bent up and looking used and worn around the edges. It was a gift for my son-in-law and I didn't have time to re-order. It was advertised as ""new"" but was really ""dog eared""."
2,"If you own ""Optimum Sports Nutrition""... forget this booklet","I am a fan of Dr. Colgan's work and use ""Optimum Sports Nutrition"" as a nutrition bible. Being a Fitness Trainer, I have followed his work over the years and think he is the best and most accurate nutrition exeprt when it comes to athletes' needs. The only problem I have with this book is that if you own the book mentioned above or have followed his work, it is a repeat, and being a very small booklet, contains very little info... and therefore, definetley not worth buying... instead, I recommend that you invest in ""Optimum Sports Nutrition"" by the same author."
5,Excellent reference book for chem. & physics of nat. systems,"This book is an excellent reference. It presents a thorough discussion of a complex topic. The authors provide many worked examples, with all required numeric inputs and resutls, that permit the reader to quickly verify his or her understanding of the material. The consistent and proper use of units throughout the book is refreshing."
1,Baaaad Service,While my new laptop seems to be working fine there should have been some included software which wasn't. It is now 3 weeks of effort trying to get them to replace the missing one. Forget about it. I would have better luck leaving a message in the Wailing Wall. I'm already regretting my choosing a Toshiba.
1,Bad Keyboard,"Being a 17"" laptop, I thought it would have a good keyboard since they have a big space to fill up. But to my disappointment, they reduced the size of the PERIOD and RIGHT SHIFT buttons! Don't they know that most people are right handed thus use the right shift key more often? Don't they know people use the period key often specially for typing email addresses and URLs of websites? This laptop has one of the worst keyboard design/layout I have ever seen. Too bad the specifications of this model were quite good."
5,Informative and important !,"This book is an invaluable reference and great educational tool for collectors of ancient coins. It explains many aspects of the field in an academic but witty style. Very readable text, also contains lots of reference material indexed for additional study of specific areas of research. A ""must have"" for those new to this area of collecting."
2,Engaging but disturbing,"Carter's prose is excellently constructed - an entertaining read. Yet some things don't seem to fit, and the overbearing sexual theme is deeply disturbing. You name a way to have sex, and it shows up in this book as a kind of obsession."
2,I Smell A Racist,"This is the second novel I've read by Angela Carter (the first being The Magic Toyshop) and I have noticed that whenever she makes a reference to a person of Afrikan descent, it is always something negative, rude, or condescending. Carter isn't half the writer that AS Byatt is. Save your money and buy yourself some real literature."
1,Not for Windows 98 as advertised,"The Amazon ad led me to believe that this adaptor would work with Windows 98 SE, but when I received the product, the packaging said that it was for Windows 2000 and above. So I returned the adaptor and received a prompt refund. I have a Windows XP machine, but I wanted to try a wireless network with my older machine. I didn't even open the package once I saw it was not for Windows 98 SE."
1,Fraudulant description!,"Bought this product because it says it's compatible with Windows ME (don't ask, neighbor didn't want to upgrade).Product not compatible with Windows ME.Manufacturer website is a joke.Distributor isn't fixing the product description."
3,Not so simple to install and get up and running,"I have an older computer with Windows ME. It is a spare computer and I wanted to connect to the internet wirelessly.It was difficult to find a USB that would be compatible, but the Sabrent said it was compatible per the product description.The problem I had was that if I did not have a more computer literate person with me, I would not have been able to install it as per the directions.No need to bore you with the details, but we were finally able to get it up and running an hour later and to date it has been working like a charm. No problems.In the end I am pleased with the product."
2,"Cheap, works, not very good.","This adaptor works, but it has extremely poor signal strength and a very slow data rate. It sits next to a laptop, and the laptop has a good, fast connection, but this has a poor connection and is extremely slow. It was a good way to get a cheap wireless connection, but now that I want to use my computer as a file server I have to buy another wireless adaptor."
4,"Works fine, good deal","No problems with Vista Ultimate. I get about 16Mbps from 20 feet away from the base station. Overall, great value"
2,not compatible,"This item shut down my software on my laptop. I found out it was not compatitble with windows. The add said that it was compatible with windows, but that turned out to be not true. This item was faulty!"
1,bad experience,The Sabrent USB-G802 network adapter did not work because something was wrong with the disc containing the driver. Since the driver could not be loaded the adapter did not work.
5,"If your feet feel good, YOU feel good!!!",This is such a great little book chock full of creative easy ideas to make your feet feel fabulous! It's the PERFECT stocking stuffer!
4,Good for bad feet,"My chiropractor recommended that I buy custom made insoles. He told me that my feet would hurt for the first 2 weeks. I bought this book before the arch supports came in and pre-conditioned my feet. After a painful foot day with the new supports, I reviewed the books recommendations and my feet felt much better. I gave a four star rating since nothing is better than a professional massage!"
3,Not quite what I thought it would be!,"I received this cd by an order error when I was supposed to get ""Monsoon"". I'm going to keep it just the same. I was disappointed with ""Anak"" done in new-age mode, but other selections on the album are quite nice. It has a global flavor and is easy to listen to. In spite of an occasional brush with something you almost recognize, if you're looking for something distinctly Asian, this isn't it!"
5,"MOOG, great quality",Just replaced my right inner tie rod with this MOOG tie rod. fits like it should and performs like it should and its made in the USA. Every steering linkage part i have replaced on my 02 F150 i have used MOOG. havent been disappointed yet! Amazon has a great price on these. Oreillys and Advance auto parts wants $60+ for one of these.
5,Great TV/VCR,"Great TV/VCR, perfect for a dorm room. Picture quality is excellent, higher than what you might expect from a small TV. 13"" sounds small but the screen appears bigger than that to me. Great buy."
3,"Pretty lame effort, but some good scenes nonetheless","Katie Kean is the best thing about this particular video, but she didn't even make the cover pic on the box! She plays the alien babe who finds herself attracted to earth women, in particular a poolside blonde bimbo (who doesn't know how to act, by the way). Katie looks hot, and she at least knows how to express herself. The other two girls who make an appearance (see box cover) have at least one really erotic scene, but there's no set-up to their encounter other than their being hired to entertain the dorky alien guy. A little imagination & effort on the part of the writers might have made it a lot hotter! In any case, the scene where one of the girls was dripping honey on the other girl's body and licking it off was quite nice! Other than that, however, not a lot to recommend here (aside from the naked women!)"
2,"no budget, no script, no acting.","The movie begins with special effects straight off someone's 15 year old mac as the alien craft heads toward earth. The two aliens in the story beam down to a backyard wearing rubber hands and masks they got at the five and dime. The first sex scene is a Barbie and Ken type that lacks any kind of heat whatsoever(it looks like they threw this in from something else they were working on). The rest of the movie takes place in a bedroom or by a backyard pool. There are two sets of girl/girl couplings; two brunettes and two blondes. The two brunettes seem to be just going through the motions and are not really interesting. However, the two blondes seem to have an on screen chemistry that works,(as long as they're not talking). Their scenes are really hot and very explicit. The ending: very lame. As far as eroctic sci-fi, fantasy, or horror go, there is better and worse to be found. There are a couple of scenes that are good, but most of this one is junk."
3,Lots of sex....very little else.,"I spotted this DVD and thought I would give it a watch, however, thre is pretty much no plot or actual story in this 'movie'. So Its pretty much like a drawn out porno flick. The actual sex scenes in this movie are pretty decent, and there are lots of them. Which is why I gave it 3 stars. So if you're into lesbianism, then this would be up your alley.Just understand that if you buy it, its just for the sex, and pretty much nothing else."
1,lame,"This movie sadly lacks as a movie and as a porno. I expected a little more, but what I got instead was a film which had no plot (this was the directors intent from what I gathered in the interviews... there was no script for this movie whatsoever) and it shows.The females are very cute, but that isn't enough unfortunately. Maybe if this was a US$5 DVD it would have been worth the expenditure."
3,"...average, baddly acted softy...","This one lacks good story development, its hard to imagine such bad writing and such bad acting from the male alien...it made the story a little irritating at times... but the lack thereof is compensated for by the female nudity that makes the film...expect lots of girl/girl action and some solo action...if like me you like to see some vulva and or labia there are a few scenes which keep you from turning it off totally."
1,The worst of the worst,I can't believe I put out actual money for this. The slease factor is extremely high. 0 production value. no redeeming qualities. I would have given it a 0 stars rating.
3,jazzz rockk,i have this album . it is very funky.i want it on c-d.ronnie foster is a good keyboard player.i think anyone who likes 70`s soul and funk will love it. look-out for it!!!!.
5,in love with le creuset!,I bought this for a salt dish! Its the perfect size! Its so small & cute. Yes I think that its a little on the expensive side but I am in love with all le creuset products & just had to have it. The kiwi color goes great in my kitchen & goes great with my Rachael Ray things too!
2,Wanted Red,"I too received a white instead of the red that I ordered. I received an email stating that they are out of stock because they are unavailable from the supplier. My thought is, if they are out of stock, why do they list them as in stock on the website, then ship you the wrong thing, they email you to tell them out of stock? Why not list them as out of stock, or even remove it?"
1,I received white too!!,"I placed my first order for the red casserole in March. It was not slated to be delivered until May! But, I waited patiently for it. In May I see that it has finally been shipped and delivered to my house, but I never received it. So they send a replacement. And it is white, not red. And apparently they no longer have red."
1,Another White One,"I too just received my Petite Casserole in white too. I thought after reading that many others got white by mistake that the problem would be corrected. I am returning my ""white"" casserole and hope that I will be able to get the ""red"" one that I ordered."
1,Not the color I needed!!!!,"While the product I received was identified as red imagine my surprise to find a white petite casserole. Like the many others who have had this problem I assumed it was just a ""freak"" accident. No accident. I am still looking for someone who actually got a red one. Very disappointed. Bummer!!!!!!!"
4,Pricey but nice,"Nice smelling cologne. I have gotten compliments. It is expensive, comes in a very attractive bottle, makes a nice gift."
5,NEW ROCKIN' COUNTRY SOUND,"I've been following The Front Porch Country Band since July 2001 when their first single, ""Hot Rock Came To The Country"" hit the airwaves. The song is about a 30-ton meteor that streaked across the east coast. As the story goes, the band was sitting on the front porch of their recording studio when they heard the sonic meteor streak out of the sky and land in a nearby field. Shocked by what they witnessed, the band turned their thoughts into music and 72 hours later the NEW ROCKIN' COUNTRY SOUND was hitting airwaves across the nation. ""Somebody Tonight"" is a MUST HAVE CD for the sheer fact that you can hear ""Hot Rock Came To The Country""!!!"
3,It's ok...just ok,"This product does provide a pleasurable sensation, moreso than cheaper products of a similar nature. It is, however, a little on the small size, so if you are 'above average' at all, don't expect it to last a long time. Take good care of it, use plenty of lube and you'll get your money's worth out of it."
3,"Cheap, but decent","I've had experiences with better toys, but this one will get the job done. The small internal ribbing feels mellow but nice, though the very first ridge after the entrance is a little thick and uncomfortable. Backwards feels nice too, though entry is a bit more difficult. For a tighter experience, try placing an old sleeve around this one.The cost outweighs the downsides of its short length, and you'll pay twice as much for a similar item from a local shop or even other online novelty stores. A cheap, decent, entry-level sleeve."
2,"Small, stretchy, breaks easily","Very small, thin and flimsy, like a fancy sleeve. The extreme tightness and ribbing are nice, and its stretchy enough to accommodate, however, it started wrinkling and tearing after first use and completely broke after third. The bigger head did not help prevent the tearing. Can recommend it only to those on the smaller side, the more you put in it the faster this thing will split. Because of its size, cleaning is not the easiest task either, so its sort of like a disposable for twice the regular price."
2,tore,"The first two weeks it was fine but it ended up splitting at the insertion point and also popped a hole at the end where it looked like it would eventually break. didn't even get my moneys worth. Im thick but come on, at least make a product that can withstand over two weeks worth of use."
2,You Get What You Pay For.,"The reason I got this was because it was fairly low price. After using the product, I can see why. The novelty sensation of the internal ribbing feels good for the first 5 seconds. After that it just feels lame. It has a tiny hole on both sides for somewhat easy clean up. Anyway, there are better products out there than this."
1,Wrong size,Ordered it for my car to replace the one I had. It's the wrong size and didn't come with any clips to keep the body on the car. Can't do anything with it.
2,We always knew that Socialism/ Communism was a calculation issue.,"But this book just didn't do as good of a job as it might have in bringing that across.A good way to start would have been to take several hypothetical socialist markets/ cases and then show what problems might have arisen in making calculations. Instead, the book came across as more a series of floating abstractions.It was a decent book, just not terribly interesting."
4,This was sooo stupid but soooo funny,"I love Jamie Kennedy. I like his hidden camera show so I thought I would give this a try. On the surface this is a very dumb movie. On the other hand if you are in it just for laughs then its hilarious. Its about a rich white boy from Malibu that gets himself into some sticky situations when he gets out into the real ""streets""."
2,Terribly Flawed!,"I can't say I liked this film very much. I don't know what the current zeitgeist in Hollywood is but there seems to be a proliferation of god-awful comedies featuring white suburbanites acting like inner city urbanized black ""gangstas"" but it's pretty sicking and not very funny. I tried to give this film a chance however and critique it on it's merit. It had only a few gags that get you laughing but they weren't enough to save this film from so much shlock. ... I invite you to see it yourself. You may like it, but then again some people like getting kicked in the groin every so often. Do yourself a favor SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,"say ""cheese""","If you're in the mood for cheesiness, racial stereotypes, and saccharine morals, watch this. I suppose it could have been worse, but I'm not sure how."
5,Scare him White!,"Cool fun movie, although dialogues are corny, and too rappish.Its about a blue-blooded white kid who listens to hip-hop when he was a child and enters tries to emulate Akon/Eminem and other rappers despite being white.His dad is running for Governer of California and is convinced by his [black] campaign manager that the wannabe [white] rapper boy is not an asset to his campaign (after some pretty hilarous outcomes).So the manegr hires two black actors to kidnap this boy, and ""scare him white"".of course, things go wrong, this boy learns about it, and pretends an actual shootout to be fake and fires guns...and dad comes to rescue him in a Hummer.Overall cool laughs."
5,HAHA HILARIOUS,WHAT CAN I SAY? THIS IS JUST A FUNNY CORNY MOVIE WITH JOKES ON THE GHETTO AND MAKING FUN OF WHITE BOYS WHO THINK THEIR BLACK! THE FUNNIEST STUFF.
3,Great Comedy,"This is a great movie to, watch, lots of hilarious scenes as well. Dont forget the directors commentary as well.The movie is on double sided DVD so u have to be extra careful when handling."
2,kennedy's white rapper gets numb after a while,"my friend Joel dragged me along to this movie and I sat in the theater for god nows how long and watching this movie that started great and like most movies out there ends horribly and throughout is lame and obnoxious, though Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson have some laughs along the way as the hired gangsters"
1,this movie posed as being funny more than 'b-rad' did,"this movie was HORRIBLE! GARBAGE! it tried to be funny, failed, and you could easily tell. it was rarly REALLY funny. and it got so 'average movie' like i almost fell asleep when i watched it. if you like the show 'Spongebob Squarepants' or things like it you might enjoy this movie if you were unbelievably bored."
3,Not Most Wanted on my List,"This is a movie about a white rapper from Malibu. I had a couple of laughs but not enough. This is definetly not a must see. If you like stupid movies, see this one."
3,Just barely three stars,"Why would I watch a film like this? Well I have a teenage son and he and his friends think it's a crack up and have watched it many times over. I try and keep abreast on what they watch and like and so I gladly sat through this one twice.I wouldn't own it, but my kids do and it's not all that bad of a flick. It's mostly a coming of age morality tale and the message it sends is mostly good and wholesome. It's probably not a good movie for the real young, but for most teens it's got nothing too bad and it's entertaining enough."
5,THE BEST!!!!!,"when i first was going to see it, i thought it looked soooo stupid and i only wanted to see it cuz of jamie kennedy, but i was surprised at how funny it was. i was laughing my a** off!"
5,Among the top comedies ever,"This is one of the funniest movies ever made, with more quotable lines, and memorable characters than any other movie I've seen. B-rad is the bomb."
4,"If you like Office Space, Anchorman and Borat...","Malibu's Most Wanted is the shiznit. It ranks up there with Office Space, Anchorman and Borat. There are many funny lines and a ridiculous plot. I especially like the scene at the rap club. Hillarious!Rent it today.[DW]"
2,Not very informative,"The U.S. command in the pacific theater is one of the most underreported of the war. And yet this command was the most innovative of any command of any power in WWII. They invented a totally new type of warfare and quickly learned to execute it exceptionally well.And they also made do with so little, winning Midway and holding Guadacanal by the skin of their teeth. The ability to know exactly where to fight and how is an incredible story.Does this book get that? Yes, some of it. But for a book that revolves around this, it gets suprisingly little. The U.S. submarine fleet sunk half the Japanese ships and basically isolated Japan from it's raw material sources. Yet it's not mentioned in this book.Add to that no real mention of how the Navy learned to develop amphibious warfare and to combine that with strong carrier support. And what you are left with is another book that just goes through the main battles of the pacific war, with a bit more emphasis on the admirals in charge."
4,solid book,This gives a solid look and account of the war in the Pacific without getting bogged down in just listing campaigns and stats
4,Not a woman's timepiece-NO WAY!!,"The watch is beautiful and admired by all who see me wear it. This includes the woman I intended to give it to for her birthday tomorrow. However, she said, ""That's a very nice masculine watch""!! You may find yourself selling this to women who will return it if they thought it was made/meant for women. It's weight, size, and dimensions all spell ""Man's watch"".."
5,sweet science,Everything you wanted to know about protein. Makes complex concepts simple. Very refreshing to heal the facts from real science!!!
5,Great alien vs predator toy,This toy is great! I love the ALIEN VS PREDATOR TOYS! EVERY TOY IS GREAT. i GIVE THE WHOLE SET 5 STARS!
1,mfu by hc,mostly harmless.....but mostly totally insane whilst simultaneously being mostly well totally out there with the best of anything else.....even when taking this piece of information into account it hardly adequately describes the absolute feeling of awe and well total insanity of the book and it's you know many parts.....i didn't think there was much in it about fjiords though and this was a disappointment.....a pity because on the whole other geographical references seemed to be well represented.....the latest addition is obviously a work a progress.....it is already showing signs of mega success sales wise and the author's managerial team will no doubt laugh all the way to the bank if any still exist after the event takes place.....this is a true story isn't it?
2,"Not the best, but not the worst, either","This one was a good, fast-paced story, if a little transparent and definitely unbelievable towards the end, Not her best work, it seemed a little disjointed and jerky, but still a reasonably enjoyable mystery."
1,"I wish there was a ""0"" option for stars","Although Mott-Davidson's Goldy the Caterer series started out strongly, it has lost all its steam. I couldn't even finish this mess.I'm so disappointed!"
1,This book is torture!!,"I have really enjoyed reading Diane Mott Davidson, but this book was so frustrating to read! Reading throug 10 pages of soup taste testing almost sent me over the edge. This was the most boring book I have read in a long time. Reading the reviews, I was sure I had read a different book than those giving the book a 5 star rating. Wow!"
2,Naive Miss G.,"Like many others who are complaining about this book, I love all of the other ones that I have read by the author. This one on the other hand not only was unbelievable, but I kept waiting for Tom (who really is a great guy) to decide to divorce his lovely Goldie. Between deciding that she is a much better cop than Tom and the totally corrupt police department that belongs in some other country--this was by far the worst of the lot. I am not real fond of Macguire either--bring back Julian PLEASE! Even the recipes in this one were not anything special...if you are reading this book as the first one of the series--don't give up! The others are Much better!"
1,Disappointing,"This is the first book by Diane Mott Davidson that I've attempted. I struggled through the first 90 pages, and then decided it wasn't worth my time. Maybe if I had read earlier books in the series and I was more invested in the characters, I would have enjoyed it. But as it is, I couldn't make myself care about what was going on. However, I highly recommend the recipe for Rainy Day Chicken Soup; it's fabulous."
3,Rain Whips Up a Murder,"There are more calories than fiber in THE MAIN CORPSE as Goldy struggles to keep her food business from being wipe-out.For fans this is a must, but somewhere in the pages something was lacking in the recipe.Fun read for a snowy afternoon.Nash Black, author of Haints."
3,Not one of Diane's best,"I love the Goldy series, and have been a faithful reader so was a bit disappointed in this book. It's not horrible, just not as engaging as her other books. The mine murder is interesting, but the ending is a bit too rushed and made the book less satisfying than her usual writing."
2,NOT Diane Mott Davidson's best work,"I enjoy the Goldy culinary series as a whole, but the plot in Main Corpse felt forced and was very unbelievable. I looked forward to getting through it so I could move on to the next book and put this one behind me."
4,Davidson,"It's good. But nothing seems to change. Oh, the people grow older, but their personalities remain the same."
2,Not her best...,"I've always enjoyed reading Diane Mott Davidson's books and I enjoy testing some of her recipes.This is the first of her books I've read in Kindle form, and I'm very struck with how sloppily it has been transformed. Her best friends name is Marla, not Maria as it reads through the book. There are numerous spelling and grammatical errors in the prose as well.I trust that this is an isolated problem - I would have thought, as an IT professional, that moving from the printed word to the electronic form wouldn't have been difficult. I would also have figured that there was some proofreading!"
4,Reading with Tequila,"I really wish I had read The Main Corpse earlier in the series as it answered so many questions, some of which I didn't even realize I had. The mystery was easy to figure out but the story itself was exciting and full of suspense. I had actual tears in my eyes by the end of the book. The Main Corpse was thrilling, emotional and definitely one of the very best books in the Goldy Culinary Mystery series."
2,Just plain lousy,"First off, the ""detective"" main character must be the most incompetent detective figure I've ever heard of after Inspector Cluseau. Just hikes off into the Rockies (with her son in tow, that's irresponsibility with a capital I), blundering on the case more than solving it. There didn't seem to be a single moment of cleverness or insight, which are the lifeblood of the mystery genre.The recipes were an original touch, but came off as tacky and broke any momentum in the plot. if anywhere, they should have been in an appendix towards the back."
3,This one's a bit over the top,"I love the Goldy series, and will continue to read them because the wonderfully imperfect Goldy seems like someone you'd want to be friends with. For that reason, I don't even mind her plot lines, which are occasionally the literary equivalent of watching paint dry. LOTS of insignificant details about her daily life, although again, it adds to that ""visiting with a good pal"" feel of the series.However, this time Diane Mott Davidson went overboard in an attempt to liven the action! Goldy would be doing major prison time if she really did what this plot has her doing, not to mention that the state would (and should) remove Arch from her home for child endangerment. Yeeks.That said, I LOVE the Macguire Perkins character, he's an utter goof and much more interesting than the anxiety-laden Julian. More of Macguire, please! And while you're at it, more of the sweet, heart-warming intimations of marital intimacy between Goldy and the bear-like Tom. Now, THAT'S yummy!"
4,A Handy Tool for your ASC,"It can pretty reliably serve as:- an escalator for experienced aspirants.- a life raft/compass for people ""learning too fast"".Some of the language is a little dated, but that's what they had to work with back then. Anyways, the signpost still works. It feels like a gift. Thanks Tim."
1,No Practical Significance,An ancient and esoteric approach to an ego-surpassing hallucinogenic experience. Little practical significance to someone not practicing Eastern mysticism. Waste of money and time.
4,Just a small correction,"""The Void"" WAS the original working title for what became ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" - and was in fact the first song recorded during the Revolver sessions"
2,Total Hype,"I was personally quite disapointed in this book. The statement 'Ram Dass's famous ""Be Here Now,"" is a prelude to ""The Psychedelic Experience,""' is beyond misleading. Be here now had so much to say, but this book adds nothing to the already huge body of liturature written on the topic. If you are interested in this text, get the html version off the net and spend your money on something serious, like the Tibeten book of Living and Dying."
1,Leary's Confusion,"The so-called Tibetan Book of the Dead (which is literally translated ""Liberation Through Hearing In-Between"" - apparently first given the Book of the Dead nickname to associate it with the Egyptian Book of the Dead) is said to give 3 opportunities to gain liberation at death - if it doesn't occur with awareness of the Clear Light, then hopefully with the appearence of the 100 wrathful & peaceful deities, or finally at the very least pulling off a decent human rebirth.Leary correctly saw the correlation of this root text with acid's stages - but linked the acid trip with the process of dying without liberation - i.e. the dead listener in the root text was not supposed to go through all 3 stages if possible. This is only Leary's first confusion in suggesting acid and the liberation mentioned in the root text are similar, as has been critiqued much later by teachers like Chogyam Trungpa."
3,Non-essential,"While this book has a good premise, it was a little too stuffy for my taste. This book is far too dry to convey the chaotic frenzy of life lived while under the influence of mind altering drugs. I think this book is so popular just because 'the high priest of LSd', Tim Leary, wrote it, and not necessarily for its own merits. If this book would be your first exploration of those realms beyond our earthly experience, I say look elsewhere, such as Food of the Gods, by Terrence McKenna. If you have already partaken of Terrence McKenna and others, and this book is just to round out your library, it is worth having."
3,Too late for tears,"As a young boy I experimented with psychedelics, heavily, and never had a ""bad trip"". After reading this book i wish I would have read it first so that I could have helped others who became ""stuck"". It's a quick read but to be honest, if you are a good minded person who is aware of the world and how everything affects us. You wont need this book. Its still a good read and I think for the price it's worth picking up."
5,Morning Sickness Cure,"This tea, especially iced, has cured my morning sickness! I drink about a 16 oz glass in the am and have some again when I start to feel ill in the afternoon. I don't know why; I stumbled upon it, but it is working!"
2,Gus the ghost-disappointment,A little disappointed as the binding of the book is falling apart and the pages are loose. It would have been nice to know this before I purchased it As it was rated as good quality.
2,Very small screen,"The product features are ok, but the screen is very small. Also, the resolution needs to be better. The photos were very grainy. An impressive looking product with not so impressive output."
2,Disappointed,The screen resolution was disappointing. The 4:3 Aspect Ratio Display with 320 x 234 Resolution lends to a very grainy picture. Remote and black and wood frames are nice. Also nice that it supports MP3 and AVI files. Also will accept most media card types.
2,"Not worth any price, IMHO","I bought this because it was 50% off. I can't see how anybody can get much enjoyment from trying to look at photos on this viewer. I guess for background noise, it would be good but as a photo viewer, it's not. Small screen + low resolution = poor viewer."
4,Matsunichi Photoblitz,I liked the fact that you can load pictures and music and make a nice presentation for a special event.Also due to the variety of media you can store pictures and display your favorites.My wife loved it.
4,Great deal when bought as deal of the day,"I've bought two of these when they were the deal of the day. Regular price is too high. My wife and I each have one in our office. A little on the small size but perfect for your desk. You have to supply your own memory card, but I personally like that better than internal memory. I resize my pictures before putting them on the card. You can put hundred of pictures on a fairly small card."
2,so-so,"Got this on one of the one-day sales, so the price was good. The frame actually looks pretty nice.However, the picture is grainy, and there seems to be a limit on the number of pictures it can view. Also, you can't make the picture fill the entire LCD unless you zoom in on the picture. Overall, it is no where near as nice as my Kodak frame.I don't dislike the frame enough to return it, but I would not buy another and I wouldn't recommend it to you."
2,Looks good until you turn it on...,"Ordered this for a present but not sure if I will be giving it to anyone now. The pictures look very grainy in the photo frame and it's to small unless your right on top of it. While this was less than $50 when I bought it I would recommend buying at least a 7"" version and spend a little more money to get a lot better picture quality. I do like the many options for memory and the actual frames look good... I have seen some that look really cheap and cheezy."
4,Nice gift for the grandparents.,"I filled up a SD memory card with pictures of my son, added some music, and sent it to grandma. You can even do videos, but I couldn't get them to work, I didn't try hard, and I think I had the video encoded in the wrong format. The screen is adequate resolution for 3x5, it isn't super sharp, but is fine from about 3' away. My only complaints were slight flickering of the screen at times and difficult to use built in menus. I loved that it takes many card formats. Good buy for fifty bucks, I would buy one again."
3,Average device...value depends on the price,"I bought it here at a very attractive price, so I am not disappointed. I can't see giving this any higher than 3 stars with its poor resolution. Giving it 5 stars is just inane.But if you can get it around 50-60 bucks and don't need good resolution, it's not a bad buy."
4,Wife loves it!,"bought this for my Wife to take to her office. She thinks it's great! Can display hundreds of pics, play music, play movies, and comes with two outside frames (black and brown). The remote is maybe excessive...!!Also, it is at a very good price, when you compare it to similar models."
3,looks good,"this product looks good, works good, and is very easy to use. However if i had it to do over again i would go with a unit with a larger screen. The 5.6 inch is kinda small, not much larger than a deck of cards. I'd say go with at least a 7 inch."
3,Good but not Great,"What I like - The extensive features, the nice looking frame, memory card choiceswhat i dont like - pixelated picturesIt is not bad for a basic digital frame but the Phillips blows it away in quality."
2,Does not display very many pictures,"This is my second digital frame but my first by Matsunichi. I am quite disappointed because it will only display a maximum of 142 images. I can find no documentation that confirms this limit but regardless of what images I load and their resolution, it wil only process 142 of them. I'm returning it and trying a different brand."
2,You get what you pay for....,Bought this item when it was gold box special. Gave it a 2 (which is a stretch) because it was cheapPros: cheapCons:small screenPictures quality is terriblemenu options limitedHey what do you want for $50.00.
3,You get what you pay for,"I bought this as a present for my father, who is technologically incompetent. I set it all up for him, which was very easy to do. Now all he has to do is to turn it on, and he can watch his photos scroll by. But I think it would be impossible for him to learn how to add new photos. The quality of the photos is fairly low, but it's enough to get a sense of what you're looking at. Unfortunately, to get a decent quality display you have to pay twice as much."
2,Poor Image Quality,"I was very excited to receive my Matshunichi Photoblitz Digital Frame. However, the thrill QUICKLY wore off. The overall image quality is quite poor. Standing a foot from the image, you can see pixelation. The frame really works best for viewing 5 or more feet away. For a 5 inch frame, that isn't exactly ideal. If you are interested in image quality, I would not recommend this frame. However, if you're looking for a cheap digital picture frame and image quality isn't a huge issue, this is probably the frame for you."
4,Great bang for the buck,"I purchased this for $50 when it was the Deal of the Day. For that price, it is unbeatable! Yes, the resolution is a bit grainy, but for my parents who don't have a computer and are missing out on all our digital pics, it is worth much more. If you want a hi-res frame, you'll pay alot more. The frame itself looks good and it is easy to use. I would grab another for $50 if I could."
5,Gabba Gabba Hey,"Dee Dee was one of my idols. This book is superb in getting to know the ups and downs of a great man. Drugs and touring took their toll on him, but he was still able to flow his words with great style. I enjoyed this book very much. I would suggest this book for anyone wanting to know more about the life of a fallen Punk God. Rest in Peace, Dee Dee, you can finally get that well deserved rest from the Chinese Rock."
3,"DEE DEE SHOULDN""T HAVE BEEN SO SAD.","This book doesnt read like a history of a rock star. As the title suggests, this is more of a memoir or diary of a lonely rocker who is well past his prime. It is more than likely his drug habit which relegated him to touring in a van with a third rate backing band 30 years after he broke the mold with the Ramones. However, even with all of the brain drain that drugs cause, he was still a caring and artistic guy.I would have liked to have seen a bit more ""life on the road"" details here, but I think the book is well worth your time. If anything, kids who wanna form a band and start touring should learn from Dee Dee's mistakes."
2,Chip prone,I have had these dishes less than 2 months and have 4 pieces that have chipped. What a dissapointment and terrible waste of money. The pattern is beautiful- if you plan on displaying them rather than using them you won't be dissapointed.
3,Nice Set,"I gave this 3 stars because while the print is beautiful & the sizes are very generous but this set chips ridiculously easily. We are not hard on our dishes, but since buying this set, nearly ALL of the pieces (cups, bowls, plates) are chipped. I bought 3 sets and 4 of the bowls were broken upon delivery. Yes, they were packed decently which leads me to believe they were broken before shipping. Other than that this is a beautiful set. The colors are vibrant and the overall ""speckling"" of the plates is nice. We have a newer dishwasher and they fit just fine in it. The bowls are nice and deep and the coffee mugs are over sized. I like them like that."
1,"Can't microwave, Odd size, Chips easily","These dishes are terrible. In the microwave, the dishes get hot, but the contents inside stay cold. I've never seen anything like it. The bowls are oddly proportioned and too big to fit in a dishwasher. The plates are too big, especially in the overly large decorative ring portion. The dishes chip fairly easily, which you can expect to happen while trying to cram these in a dishwasher or your cabinets."
3,Great but subject to chipping,"I really like the style, size and color of these dishes but they are affected by the microwave in a way other dishes are not (they get hot) and they chip very easily. My personal experience is that other Pfaltzgraff ware is also subject to chipping."
4,Quality product from Pfaltzgraff....as usual!!,The product is even better looking in person. Absolutely beautiful. Great colors and quality. Can't go wrong with Pfaltzgraff!!The only problem with the product is that the dinner plates are too wide to fit in a standard wall cabinet. I have to store mine in a corner wall cabinet which is deeper.
5,Excellent Deal,Absolutely the best price on the internet. Free shipping made this purchase the best I've made in quite some time. I recieved the item very quickly. I give this seller and this transaction 5 STARS
3,"Oversize, Microwave Hot, Chips","Beautiful dinnerware, prone to chipping and the dinner plates are not conventional size. Do not microwave these unless you want your fingers to melt, you should know that by looking at the colors. I consider them disposable, buying a new set every couple of years at 100 bucks."
3,pfaltzgraff sedona,"Very attractive dishware, but the dinner plates are too large to fit into a standard dishwasher or into a standard cupboard. I would never have purchased dishes I couldn't place in the dishwasher."
3,Beautiful but too large,"These are lovely, but they are simply not practical as our main, everyday dishes. As noted by others, the plates are huge--more like platters. The salad plates are a more useful size. But it is not just the plates--the mugs hold 16 ounces and the bowls hold 20 ounces. How many people eat 20 ounces of soup, cereal, etc.? Also, as noted, they aren't good in the microwave (unlike other pfaltzgraff that I've owned)."
3,"Beautiful, but -","I love them, the color, weight, feel, but careful, the dinner plates don't fit in my dishwasher :-("
1,"pretty, but disappointing","I bought a full set of Sedona dinnerware, and, while I didn't have an issue with the plates fitting in my dishwasher, I had to modify a plate rack so that the plates could be set vertically front to back instead of sideways in my kitchen cabinet. The dinner plates are way too large anyway - we use the salad plates instead. These dishes are horrible in the microwave (the plates get hotter than the food), and you only have to tap two together very gently to end up with chipped dinnerware. I will never buy earthenware or Pfaltzgraff again."
2,"Great to look at, but lots of problems","Bought two full sets from Pfaltzgraff, plus some bowls and storage containers in the same pattern. All of our plates and salad bowls have chipped from normal use. We've had to throw out all of the soup bowls we purchased with the sets because they developed cracks right through the middle of them under the glaze.And these are definitely NOT microwave safe. You WILL burn yourself if you handle them without a potholder.Shame, because Pfaltzgraff used to be such a top-notched company. My mother's Yorktowne set (manufactured in the US) is still in perfect condition, and they are well over 20 years old and used frequently. These plates, manufactured in China, are a poor comparison."
3,Design Great! Not very practical,"I love the Sedona pattern and the fact that it is Microwave safe. The plates are nice and big and the bowls deep and good for soups, cereals and such however the coffee cups have chipped on the rim of two cups and I don't even use a dishwasher so they are not very good for daily use. I am sort of disappointed in the fact the design works very well in my house but they are not very practical."
4,Michael Rosen pushes further with Art,"The subtitle of this book is ""photographs that test the limits."" Compared to the mainstream, these frank images will be shocking. However, take a moment and allow yourself to acknowledge that this is a bit different and carefully look again. Notice that all the participants are smiling, or have looks of ecstacy on their faces, or they are boldly gazing right at the camera. If everyone is proudly experiencing pleasure, is what they are doing truly ""shocking?"""
1,not what I expected :(,"Lame, cliche, formulatic, not anything new or worth purchasing.At best, a book that shows fisting and some gay sex. Otherwise, not in any way shocking..nor in any way important enough to spend a penny on. I was so expecting something MORE, something ARTISTIC...Don't buy it."
5,Better than Ever!,"I've always been a fan of C&K and so many memories come back to mind when I listen to their music. ""About You"" from their Elua album is my all time favorite song and it's hard to top that. At first, I didn't think I'd like this CD as much as their first ones seeing that there were songs from other artists and I always appreciated C&K's uniqueness. I was proven wrong! Their sweet voices are better than ever, the arrangements flow well and do not cover up their beautiful harmony and overall, I can picture the guys jamming and really getting into it - when I can 'see' them while listening to the music, it makes it what music is suppose to be - a moving experience. Good 'sit outside w/ the earphones on getting some rays' album! Love C and K and Amazon.com for having their music available to die hard fans who have had trouble finding C&K in stores. Thanks!"
3,"skagen men's 433ls,m stainless steel black dial watch","watch arrived battery DOA.band extent from dial is one piece not collapsing making the watch look as if it is cheaply made,especially if you have average size of wrist.or worse if your wrist is small.other than that the watch look and feel excellent.i'd keep it if amazon was to pay for the battery.but they didn't really want to,and i would not know if after battery change it would work.then it would be more money outta my pocket.so it is being returned."
4,Couldn't resist,"With a price of $35 I couldn't pass this one up. Reading the reviews, I was pretty discouraged, but considering the only thing people complained about was the battery, I figure it would be a pretty safe purchase. The box was a little rough, mostly dirty. I was discouraged, but when I got to the watch, everything was fine. It was in the original package and everything was included. The watch was working out of the box and had no defects. There's a lot to love about this watch. It's slim, super thin and looks great. My only complaint is the length of the band. I've got a pretty small wrist, but a gorilla could wear this watch with how big the band is. I'll have to remove a few links.Pros; Looks, Price, StyleCons; Made for a large wristBottom Line; Even though a few others had bad luck with this purchase, I'm pretty happy with what I got."
1,old stock,"should have listened to a previous reviewer - watch arrived dead... shipped it back right away.watch looks o.k. for that low price($35), but really nothing special..."
5,Thin Watch,"This company is known for its thin watches and this one definitely holds up to that reputation. It is very attractive and will look very professional. Once you have had a thin, light-weight watch, it is hard to wear the heavier styles. I am giving this one as a gift and I am very proud to do so."
3,Good watch but arrived with dead battery,"I own other three Skagens and this is a good watch too, but arrived with a dead battery. Returning the product is not worth the wait and the small cost of replacing the button battery, but Amazon should take better care, especially when this complaint has been a common one."
1,Not a quality watch,You get what you pay for. In this case you just paid $100 for a cheap watch made in China with Denmark branding slapped on it. Back to Amazon it goes! Amazon please start listing the country of origin on your products BEFORE we buy them.
1,Ridiculous: The face still shatters for no reason,"Tried another Skagen watch, but they STILL have spontaneous face breakage even when the watch is not being worn. They have some stresses due to the thinness. I have had two replaced and they are NOT GUARANTEED. Can't believe they haven't gotten this under control."
4,Easy out,This is a cool product solving most of the stucks on our snow runs. It easly lifts any wheel with holes in it for the hooks. My series land rover wheels will need a custom strap that hooks around the tire to make use of this product. It easily lifts the offending tire out of the hole for back filling. A good buy in my book. Works with my generic jack.
4,Works well,This product works well. However as some others have said a bolt to hold the thing on the jack isn't really needed and is rather cumbersome to remove and install. A quick pin would have been better. DO YOU HEAR THAT HI-LIFT?
3,"Didn't work for my 94 f250, but i was able to make it work","I tried lifting my 94 f250 with this, but the strap that holds the actual strap in the upside down ""V"" shape broke because the center caps on my rims made the ""V"" have to spread out too much. What I did was cut the strap off and replaced it with 1/2"" chain and a couple of quick links. This way the chain will be stronger than the original strap and also I am now able to adjust where the hook is along the chain. So it works but if you are going to lift anything heavier than a Jeep, know that you may need to make some adjustments yourself."
2,Hi-Lift Jack LM-100 Lift Mate,"Product appears to be made very well and should work great. The reason for two stars is the vendor needs to be more specific about what wheels the lift mate will work with. The after market wheels for my Willys wagon have smaller oval holes (1 inch smaller dimension by 1-1/4 inch longer dimension) and the hooks won't fit in them. I'll keep the product for my 2011 Tacoma 4WD since it does work with the standard Tacoma wheels. I was suspicious about this when I ordered the Lift Mate, but I had to order it to find out if it would work or not."
2,A very weak hapkido text.,"I was very dissapointed with this book. There are very few good books on the art of Hapkido, and this is really not one of those. The History, theory, and philosphy is adequate for a novice, but offer little to anyone who knows even a little bit about hapkido . Also the pictures were very poor quality. The techniques demonstrated also seemed very sloppy, and in my eyes lend very little credability to the author. I think he should have taken a little more time and care in putting this book together."
1,Hapkido the Integrated Fighting Art,"I thought this book was too basic and not very well put together. Being a student and teacher of Hapkido, I was very disappointed at the lack of knowledge the author exhibited. I would not recommend this book."
2,"reader from Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada","Regarding the reviewer from Tennessee, having read the above title, I agree with him that Mr. Spear's book seems a little shallow, esp. the red/black belt section. However, it should be pointed out that Mr. Spear claims in his book he earned his black-belt in Korea. Apparently, in Korea, many Hapkido dojangs have more simple ranking systems than in North America (which often feature the colours of the rainbow). It is likely Mr. Spear came from such a system where there are only four belts colours, consistent with the colours of the Korean Flag; white, blue, red and black. In such a system, a person would reach 1st degree black after only one year of training. However, in that system (or any system) a 1st degree blackbelt in Hapkido is not usually an expert, anyhow. Usually, a 3rd or 4th dan is considered ""respectable."""
4,A good basic introduction to Hapkido.,"Though I do not have any rank in the Korean art of Hapkido, I do feel a bond to that particular system of combat. Seeing the techniques of Hapkido reminds me of my own experience learning Jujitsu, Judo, Karate and Aikido. Indeed, the history of modern Hapkido demonstrates the strong influence of Daito Ryu Jujitsu in its techniques. I also agree with the author that Hapkido, like combat Jujitsu, is an integrated art. This is because Hapkido has blocks, punches, strikes, kicks, wrist throws, wrist holds, armlocks, arm-bars and all types of throws and ground techniques. Hapkido also has weapon defense and weapon use techniques as part of their curriculum. In conclusion, this is a good introductory text on Hapkido.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Tanto-Jutsu Official Manual: Bushi Satori Ryu)."
4,a good general over view,"I am a hapkido instructor and found this book to be a very good all be it brief summary of hapkido. I was impressed with what was covered and how it was covered. I just wish the book was longer:) It is not the type of book you are going to read and become a hapkidoist, but if you are interested in refining your own techniques or just getting another view of the world of hapkdio then I recommend it."
2,Simple overview with poor photography/illustrations,Although I added this book to my library I did so as a collector or martial arts material verses as a textbook to help me with my studies. It would have been better in my opinion to do a good job on some of the basics of the art rather than to approach such an intricate discipline in such a general manner. The quality of photographs could also be improved in further editions. A follow-up book would be appreciated to allow the author to impart more details and sequence of learning the art.
2,Sparsely simple.,"I found this book to be a very simplistic review of the various aspects of Hapkido. In the author's defense, Hapkido is a mindbogglingly broad art, and so it is difficult to cram even a 10th of the possible technical variations into 184 pages. Mr. Spear gives an adequate history and a good explanation of the basic philosophy of Hapkido. Some very basic kicking and striking techniques are illustrated and discussed, as well as a few self-defense techniques, which, after all, is what Hapkido is all about. However, the techniques required in this book for red belt and first-degree blackbelt are ridiculously sparse and simple, at least for that level of supposed sophistication. It made me laugh. As a beginner's introductory guide to Hapkido, this book is adequate. It's certainly not going to overwhelm the reader with an overdose of information. You can't learn Hapkido from a book, anyway - it takes experience in the dojang, plain and simple."
3,Probably not worth the price unless you're a committed fan,"A used copy of this CD will run you at least $30. It has 3 good songs -- Hollywood The Second Time being both a personal favorite and that of other reviewers. I really like the cover of Do It Again, and Ain't My Day sounds like a worthy extra from ""Seven Days In Sammystown"".Now, ""Sammystown"" is easily worth $30. It is a haunting, unique album, possessed with passion.The remainder of ""Happy Planet"" is OK. But only pay $30-or-more for the CD if you're a confirmed Wall of Voodoo-aholic."
4,A good sleeve,"These sleeves are a bit better than Ultra Pros, but inferior to the KMC MAT series. The Shields have minor imperfections along the edges, which make them slightly less comfortable to hold or shuffle. These have glossy backs (which comes down to personal preference). It's easier to put cards in and take them out of Dragon Shields, which makes them good sleeves for drafts.I'll keep them around for drafts but these don't replace KMCs at all. The only reason I scored them 4/5 is because most sleeves are utter garbage and these are pretty good.Also worth mentioning, I have the pink color sleeves and they are NOT completely opaque. If you are running two-sided cards, I would not say these are tournament legal."
4,Great for young christians,"As a young Christian, there is usually the feeling that ones' praying could be deeper, spontaneous yes but also ""feel"" more meaningful. This books breaks down the process in bite size instructions with relevant scriptures and insights. Very helpful. you will always go back to it as you build your prayer life."
5,The book's fault is that it's too brief,Short but sweet history of the Scottish monarchs is good for historical and genealogical research.
4,Not bad,"My son is a huge Wiggles fan - so I got the two of these as a combo purchase. Dance Party was made a while ago so he wasnt too intrested in it. If I would of known that I wouldnt of purchased it, but Yummy Yummy is great. The songs and videos are more up to date (as what you would see on Disney) and he knows the songs and dances. So - overall it was a purchase well worth the money. As long as my son is happy so am I. I would just caution parents on buying the older versions because children dont seem to 'know' the Wiggles or seem to be intrested."
1,nasty and derivative,"I will be completely honest, I only got half way through before turning this trash off. This is one of those sleazy exploitation shockers that were so prevalent in its day. Im all for a gripping terrifying backwoods thriller but this was just unlikable from the start. If you like scuzzy drive in fodder than you may want to give this a whirl, otherwise you can avoid this one."
3,this game is average,This game is a WWII game and is based in several different locations. The game's graffics are ok. It took me all of three days to complete it. The weapons consist of an m1 garrand a thompson machine gun and sometimes a rocket launcher and tank. if you like games that you can beat in a matter of days buy this one.OVERALL I WOULD GET THIS GAME
3,Nice to look at,I received this ear cuff and it looked just as it was described. But it bends very easily and isn't that comfortable to wear.
3,Who knows what the title means,"Having heard Spoonfed live several times acoustic and electric, I didn't know the songs had titles; who cares, the energy and love put into the music did away with the need to name things. In this collection you will hear samples, from movies to who knows what, instrumentation is every thing from bass, guitars, synth to garbage cans and odd doodads. This is protonuevonewagehippie music. The first albumn is better."
1,dying avocado tree arrived on time,"I ordered two avocado trees from Clifton Nursery. When they came, one looked like it was in shock but I think I have revived it as its getting new growth. The other one looked like it was dying but I still tried to revive it. The tips of the leaves arrived turning black and every new little nub of new growth turned black as soon as it popped out. I waited a week then called Cliftons Nursery and spoke to a fellow named John who was very unfriendly. He gave me every excuse in the book as to why the tree was doing that, then said call him back in two weeks and it'll probably be fine. Well, all the leaves have died and some of the branches have turned black and are dead. Yes, I'm going to call him back. It'll be interesting to see what he says again. The tree was a lot of money and the shipping was also. I think I should get a refund for both"
4,Best of the old-time monkey as pet guides,This book is one of three books that I have seen that dates back to the monkey- as- pets craze of the 60's and 70's. I find it the most honest of them in that she admits right in the beginning that the vast majority of baby monkeys at pet stores are there because natives murder the monkey's mother to capture it. Other books such as the one by Leonore Brandt totally ignore this dark and terrible truth.However the book is still seriously out of date and anyone interested in getting a pet monkey should get hold of the two volume set by Monkey Matters. It is quite expensive but much more current and much more realistic about the profound committment necessary and the substantial risks involved.
4,Great performances of some of Bernstein's most memorable songs,"This disk is divided into two sections ""Songs and Duets"" containing some of Bernstein's most memorable songs and ""Arias and Barcarolles"" his last completed work.The ""Songs and Duets"" are great showing Bernstein's prodigious melodic gift. They are sung as art songs with piano and cello accompaniment and are worth the price of the disk.""Arias and Barcarolles"" is less accessible and less enjoyable.Excellent performances and well recorded."
2,DISSAPOINTED,"THESE CLIPS LOOK GOOD, BUT THEY DO NOT WORK WELL. USING THEM ON THE THINEST TARP MATERIAL THE POINTS DOO NOT PUNCTURE AS THEY SHOULD AND THEY DO NOT RETAIN ONCE IT HAPPENS. UNLESS YOU PLAN TO USE THESE WITH PAPER: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Could have saved money!,The jacket is very nice however the price tag on it from the store was 20.00 less then the amount i paid on Amazon.. ??
5,Saves their mattress,Saves the night and their mattress. These are really thick and does a great job of absorbing the river which my boys pour out at night. No longer do I have to deal with wet crib mattresses and strong urine stench. For some reason all the other underpants leak...dunno. I have found the ones and my boys are finally having a goodnite.
5,these rock!!!!,"I went to a sleepover and I wet the bed, but when I woke up the goodnites had taken care of everything. they're perfect! They are not loud. they absorb well, and no one new I wore them."
5,Minimalistic Perfection,Even though most if their music is made electronically there is something very old school and organic about them. Their sound is minimal but by no means empty. Underneath the soft texture of their music you can here many samples and instrument flowing harmoniously. Ther are also very true to their band name..this music could easily be a backgrould score to and cool movi. But the beauty of this particular cd is that this music serves well as background score as well as in your face jazz! There are a few vocal touches here and there but the cd is instrumental for the most part. My favourit track on this cd is the first one. Over this cd is very intecse and cool and very enjoyable.
2,Paying bills,"2 1/2Fringe release of remixes drenched in The Cinematic Orchestra's signature organic free-jazz vibe nonetheless suffers from typical mix-disc syndrome where even keen production seems to be at the aide of guiding other mediocrities. There is a small amount of actual Cinematic material being remixed here, but certainly not enough or in any must-hear way to garner many casual fans to sniff this one out. Instead, try to just hear the DJ Krust remix final track, the only production that feels worthy in the catalog."
3,Rescue is not for young ones,"I bought this set for my 1 yr old. He loves the Celebrate With Bob dvd. But I have had to put away the Rescue dvd. It is about Muck being scared of the dark. Believe it my son is scared of this and is now scared of the dark. I hope when he is older and understands more I will be able to play this again and he will not be scared.Be careful and observe your child, if they get scared take it away the first time they watch it. So that they do get scared of the dark."
2,"Not that interesting sequel ""If You Are the One""","This is a sequel to the first ""If you are the One"" - which is a gem. Since I wanted to find out what happens between the two lovers who found each other through a Chinese dating service, I decided to buy this sequel rather than waiting to rent it on Netflix.It is a bland movie without much witty dialogues as in the earlier one. One will not miss anything without seeing the sequel, imho. They got married and live happily after even though to reach that point, they experienced some challenges."
3,Fine if you aren't looking for indepth info,"I purchased this book to use with Sonlight Core 300, the 20th Century. It is one of the main required texts for the program. I am very glad that I was able to purchase it cheap from a seller, as there is not a lot of information in the book. The pictures are interesting to browse, but I am sure that one could easily complete a study of the 20th century without the book. It's not a bad book, just not a great book."
5,Awesome,Great read about the all time best modified drivers! I was lucky enough to witness many races that he competed in and glad that I got to witness him in person!
3,"Not so many ""Goodnites""","My son still has too many nights that he wakes with leakage while using this product, even with limiting fluids and using the bathroom before bed. The product provides some support but we were expecting full support while he continues to train."
1,I think the author had a personal agenda,"This book doesn't hold a candle to Von Drehle's ""Among the Lowest of the Dead."" I picked this book up hoping to be informed and possibly persuaded that the death penalty is a poor system. The author's uninteresting discussions about personal conflicts with people and organizations made me less than empathetic to his point of view."
5,Great Music for When its Not Naptime,"I bought this one at a Justin Roberts concert and I was not disappointed.Justin covers a wide range of topics common to childhood from pretending to be sick to get out of school, to bullies, to fear of the dark and more.Justin's music style also covers a wide range, jazz, R&B, Rock (in many forms), etc. This one is easy on adult ears and don't be surprised if you find yourself singing with your child.My daughter will spontaneously start singing songs from this CD and we will have to play it. Billy The Bully is a particular favorite of hers with its ""one by one by one by one"" chorus.Check out Justin's other music as well."
2,disapointing,doesn't cover the history and technical aspects of the electric power industry as it claims.. it's just old footage from some programs not comprehensive history
2,Too small to stated size,"Shoes 1/2 to 1 size too small. Return policy a pain, costs more then worth to return. Product good, Amazon poor"
2,When intellectuals beef...,"The idea that Vidal could title this book the U.S. of Amnesia without referencing Foucault's would have been disturbing had I not already been acclimatized to noted scholars' tendency to omit references to other noted scholars with the same idea. If I may be allowed to be as lax with this criticism as Vidal seemed with his references, I'd like to suggest that Foucault has before described the Western, specifically, the U.S.'s relation to history as an amnesiac historicism. Must be nice to write a book and not worry about the dreaded P-word. I take this as another example of making an idea suitable for mass consumption by tailoring it to the audience. Afterall, how many would accept such a statement from a Frenchman."
4,"Love it, but...","As much as I love Gore Vidal, I am getting tired of buying his pamplets and seeing that there are only 30-40 pages of new essays. I like the older essays, but I liked them better the first time I bought them. That gripe aside, the new essays are more of the Vidal style, typically witty and perfectly written."
5,Terrific,"Refreshing insights from an interesting commentator, not at all dated. This should live on long after Gore's death. You won't be wasting your time with this one."
4,Shipped fast,"Item was here quickly, but found the savings not to be as good as I thought. I can get the same product at the same price in town. That's my lack of research though."
4,engine smoother - no difference in mpg,"in my '99 subaru legacy wagon with 230k miles been getting poor gas mileage lately. over two tanks of gas, about 5oz per tank, this hasn't improved my mpg but the engine is noticeably smoother as well as quieter at higher RPMs."
5,Cheap for its size and saves you money.,"This product is cheap for its size and beats any local shop, and even walmart. May be a placebo effect, but I feel from cold-start to idle, my 3.2 v6 is much more quieter and ""vibrates"" are eliminated. Use exact amount with 100cc syringe after every fill up. Literally do quick math to the cc after reviewing gas input. Another note, using 87 gas now vs 91. May be placebo but I think I still feel the effects.Will update everything from weather to terrain to distance daily once bottle is all used."
5,best for the buck,"With the price of fuel,? you would be wasting money buy not using this product.It also makes the performance better."
4,"MPG is better, runs smooth","It helped my gas mileage and my truck ran smooth while towing.I initially used Lucas Oil while pulling a double-axle trailer on a 2,000+ mile trip. My truck got over 12 MGP for most of the trip. I was expecting less than 10 MPG so the product paid for itself."
5,The only way to purchase this product,Purchasing this item in the 1 gallon size is the only way. It is a fraction of the retail amount at the auto parts store.
2,Whats with all the hype?,"I've been using this for two years. It doesn't seem to do anything. There are no formal published studies out there other than one which used this on a 2 cycle motor and proved that it did increase runtime of the engine. The study doesn't identify why there was an increase in runtime. Those results could be a few things - Lucas products could have boosted the octane, lubed the cylinders, or improved the quality of the fuel, or all of those things. However, there is no proof that those benefits are safe for the engine.Other than that, I have not seen any increase in mileage with this product in larger engines. Moreover, even if there were mileage increases, the product may harm the piston seals.Unless otherwise tested, I may just be dumping canola oil in my engine. And as much money as Lucas makes on this product through unsubstantiated user reviews, they should publish some kind of testing for it..."
2,Lucas Fuel Treatment,"I've been using the Lucas Fuel Treatment for 6 weeks now and have not noticed any improvement using this product to clean my fuel injectors. I'm still getting hesitation when I accelerate. My car is a Honda Accord 5 spd with a 4 cyl engine and 186,000 miles. I've owned it since mile 1 and I fill-up twice a week. Hopefully by the time I get thru using this stuff my injectors will work OK."
5,So Inovative!! I have used these techniques in my classroom!,"Being a teacher of students with severe handicaps and a fan of tennis, I have found Mr. Vasquez's book to be revolutionary! His book includes all styles of learning modalities and it reaches out to all children. I have used and adapted Mr. Vasquez's games with my students. I am very excited to tell you that I have seen results with students that, in the past, did not respond to traditional methods of sensory stimulation! Through the use of this text, I have been able to reach those students!! Thank you Mr. Vasquez for a very good book. And please if you are a fellow educator, I HIGHLY recommend you take the time to read this book!!!!!Sincerely,Laura Mageary, Woodland Hills, California."
5,Magnificent,"Another awesome display of these gifted individuals. I must say that track 11 - ""I Then Shall Live"" is majestically beautiful. Also, David Phelp's arrangements are absolutely wonderful. The use of some chording is reminiscent of some of the great jazz vocal bands from the 60's (like The Four Freshmen).Thanks for this project! It is truly inspiring."
5,Perfect,"I must say that this is the closest to perfect music I have ever heard . I grew up on southern gospel and since have added contemporary Christian to my music loves but this is the music I want to hear in heaven. :) I have always loved the Gaithers and think David Phelps is a master. These men are surely annointed by God to bring their listeners joy, inspiration and in some cases chills. Don't hesitate to get this God-breathed CD."
3,"Four guys, not one group","Some nice arrangements in here and all of the guys are definitely powerful, skilled singers, but it's infrequent on this CD that you hear the group singing as that -- a group. I kept getting distracted by the distinctly different qualities of each voice poking through, battling one another even. There's not much blend or match between the voices here, particularly when they are really ""letting loose"" and cranking the chords. They each want to belt it out, and it sounds more like four different guys singing at the same time, than one group singing together.The track that most consistently comes across with a unit sound, where the individuals meld into one sound, is the last track. That's really wonderful...until the spoken prayer comes in, which seems to take away from the emotion of the words & harmony of the song, doggone it."
2,"This isn't singing, it's screaming",There is absolutely no question these guys can sing. But they scream the lyrics of nearly every song. I have really gotten into a cappella lately and was looking forward to this CD. I was very disappointed. It would be excellent if it wasn't so darn loud. This is one CD I will pass on to someone else.
2,"Smug, self-absorbed portrait of Europe's youth","This french film is a sequel of L'Auberge Espagnol, a good film about a bunch of European students leaving in a pension in Barcelona. In the sequel, this same people are back, now at their beginning of their professional lives, and dealing mostly with romantic situations. Unfortunately, there were some problems with the original movie, that appear upfront in the sequel. Namely, this purports to be a celebration of a new, united Europe, but instead, it celebrates an isolated class, terribly content with itself. It is indeed very strange that in a film about Europe's youth, no third world immigrants appear, none of the characters seems to be unemployed or having employment problems. They seem too content seeing themselves as the people that will rule Europe tomorrow, and if that is true, you must start feeling sorry for that continent, since these people are smug, self-involved, and care very little about the misfortunes of others."
5,Very good product,I needed to replace my full length headers so I went with the JBA mid length expecting I might lose a little performance but the car runs better with these. Thick 3/8 exhaust and collector flanges. Install was much easier. Highly recommended!
5,A Great Supplementary Text,I've used this book as a text in a high school anatomy class. It provides a solid background in terminology. Most students enjoyed the format of the book and were pleased with the number of words they added to their vocabulary. One student (that I am aware of)tested out of their terminology class in medical school. It is an easy book to use and is a great supplement to a class such as anatomy. It would not be suitable for a stand alone medical terminology class because it does not provide reinforcement activities or background information.
3,Chicago Cutlery Metropolitan 7-1/2-Inch Chef's Knife,I'm not happy with with knife . It's too thin and don't work as well.look for something more solid . I had better thoughts about Chicago cutlery products
3,the map of sex and love,"ok movie. it is very slow in actually getting to the point of its theme.acting was good, beautiful location shooting helped a lot"
1,Is this book really about the periodic table?,"Reasonably interesting book but not if one is specifically interested in the periodic table or its evolution. Only one or two chapters are actually on the periodic table. In addition the final 40 or so pages consist just of a ""catalog of elements"", essentially a complete list of all the elements, the dates they were discovered etc. This is nothing more than a page filler for a book that is well written but rather too superficial for anybody really interested in chemistry and physics."
2,"Nicely designed, but doesn't cover my planes","This is a nice pocket sized book organized for quick identification of a variety of civil aircraft. In practice, this means a lot of modern small jets and private planes are included as well as the commercial jets. Unfortunately, no coverage whatever is given to any classic planes (pre-1960?), nor to some of the models frequently seen overhead here in the US. It does include many planes I have never seen in my life. These must be part of the UK scene.So overall, this book is of no use to me, but might be just the ticket if you want to spot 747's or corporate jets or Piper Cherokees."
5,Coaster,This was exactly what I wanted! Was going on a trip and in the past always had to have a tissue or paper towel to soak up condensation from water bottles etc. this little coaster worked like a charm!!!!
3,"Slow, flakey, and power-hungry but still useful","I got one of these for Christmas and have been having constant problems with it. It doesn't seem to work at all in downtown Chicago. It also doesn't work very well near the lakefront. However, in the suburbs and less congested areas of the city it works quite well. It eats up batteries quickly, but not quickly enough to cause problems (however, the battery _indicator_ becomes unpredictible when the GPS is in use). The mapping software works very well, although it is a bit lacking in feature."
1,It chewed thru batteries and never found a Satellite solutio,I purchased one of these and kept it for a week and only by laying the unit flat on the ground for 10 minutes did I ever get a satellite fix. As soon as I moved the unit to try and get some use from it the fix was gone and I had to go thru the whole process again. I also went thruogh 3 sets of batteries inside both my VDX and inside the unit itself in that time. There is no monitor to let you know when the batteries need replacing and no way to decipher what the unit was doing or whether it was functioning or not. I purchased the Geode and have been much happier with the customer support and software upgrades through them. I would definatly not purchase this unit.
1,Problems,"I have had problems similar to the afore mentioned as well, I don't live in a large urban area, but was unable to get it to lock onto satellites, even at 5 minutes...granted I've been indoors, but if it won't work anywhere but open air without trees, it loses most of its functionality."
1,NEXIAN customer support is HORRIBLE,"After I purchased a refurbished unit, Nexian would not let me register the unit. They stated that the unit had already been registered and that I could not register it. Unfortunately, the only way to get the advertised software from Nexian is, yes, you see it coming, through the registration process. Nexian's customer support would not reset the database lock on the refurbished unit's serial number and part code. As such, I was never able to get the software to operate the unit as advertised.I DO NOT RECOMEND THIS UNIT. THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT FROM THE COMPANY IS THE WORST!!"
1,Horrible,"This is a complete waste of money and time. It won't sync up with the satellites unless I'm up on my roof, and even then the slightest move throws it off. I also own the Garmin Street Pilot color and even on a cold start, the max it takes to sync up is 2 min, and that's in my HOUSE. In my car it takes no time. So, as you can see, when I got the HandyGPS, it was quite a disappointment. It obviously has something to do with power constraints. However, I sometimes worry that my Garmin is too powerful because whenever it's on my radio has a lot of static... hmmm."
2,Handy GPS Review,"I wasn't too happy with this product. A lot of times I find it not getting the proper reception it needed. I also wish I could have stored more maps on my PDA, but was very limited. Basically If I'm going somewhere I'd have to put that city on my PDA before I left to that destination. My first goal was too have all the surrounding cities map files stored on my PDA. For 200 dollars I don't think this product is worth it. Until there is a adapter for the cigarette lighter in the car, you'll be going through a lot of batteries as well. I think I'm going to return this and buy one of the more expensive mobile units from companies such as pioneer. I have seen these before, and they seem to get great reception, and the large color displays are quite helpful as well. These units cost around the 1000 dollar range, but have voice activated controls. While none of this stuff is absolutely necessary, since good ol maps cost only a couple bucks, they sure are convenient. I love technology."
1,Don't waste your money,"I've had the same problems as everyone else, trouble tracking satellites, trouble maintating a signal. The main reason I'm returning it though is power consumption. I can't feed my visor 8 triple A batteries every day just to play with gps, and even then the sporadic functionality is very frustrating. The fact that no car adaptor is available for this product is ridiculous. Wait for a better company to release a springboard gps."
1,Don't bother if you value your $$$$,"This thing eats batteries for breakfast, lunch and dinner! The first time out it killed the 2 AAA cells before it got a single satellite. With fresh Duracell Ultras I was able to get 4 sats after about 15 minutes, but after another 1/2 hour or so of reading through the manual and going thru the menus, dead batteries again, this time it killed the 2 in the Visor as well as its own.As far as any obstructions, I was on a beach in Key West, FL. No trees, buildings, etc., etc...With 4 fresh batteries I was able to get a lock on 5 sats and display a very poor looking map of my location. Elevation read 307', yet I was on a pier only 4' off the surface of the Atlantic ocean.I can think of better things to blow $150 on. Glad I wasn't lost when I was trying to use it, or I might never had made it back to warn you...."
4,Good product with one exception,"So far, I am enjoying the HandyGPS. I have found the mapping software very detailed but has a strange and cumbersome UI.My main problem is that it seems to REALLY eat batteries. If you're planning on using this, then I recommend investing in some rechargable AAA'sAll-in-all, the product is a nifty gadget -- and worth the price tag."
5,5 Minutes? Were you laying the Visor Flat in your hand?,"I've had my HandyGPS for two months now and the only time I had a problem connecting to satellites is when I was holding the unit flat in my hand looking down at it. I called customer support immediately explaining my frustration and they informed me to hold the unit vertical. Imagine my delight when I received a 3D fix in about a minute. I give the HandyGPS two thumbs up. It comes with great software (UbiGo) and they are coming out with a Rand McNally Street Finder Deluxe mapping software (capable of doing point to point directions I hear) the end of this month! Not only is it a great module that is easy to use, it also comes with fantastic customer support!"
1,Handy GPS,"What A piece of junk. It ate my Visor batteries before it even found one satellite. It has yet to work at all, it has NEVER found even one satellite. The visor batteries lasts less the 10 minutes. I cannot believe that Nexian can get away with selling something that seems like a complete hoax. I only hope Amazon will take it back."
1,"Magellan is Better, Handy Wins the Booby Prize","I bought this as a Christmas gift. This was an embarassing dud. It failed to lock to any satellite. The manual did not provide help. I then went to the web site for Nexian. It was down... for 3 days during Christmas. Maybe (all of) the employee(s) left for the holiday season.I tried suggestions provided by Amazon users. That failed. I asked the recipient of my gift to go ahead and take their trip and see if it was just a location issue. No, it failed to work at any point in a 1200 mile journey. I returned it - five *'s for Amazon for the great return policy! :).I bought Magellan. It gets 5 *'s. First, it worked. Second, it has so many utilities to let you know how many satellites it sync'd with, their individual signal strengths, their constellation. Not sure whether they have a help desk, but their web site was up whenever I needed it. Hope it helps."
2,Nexian Handy GPS Springboard Module,Receiver sensitivity is very weak. It take 3 to 5 minutes to aquire a satellite. If your hand is close to the module the satellite signal is lost. The signal is too intermittent to be useful while driving. Useful battery life is only about 2 hours. There are very few maps available and those are for the east and west coast areas. Obsolete.
4,Good Product,"This product is great, however it is MUCH fluffier than the picture shows. I bought it to use WITH the matching double headrest, however, it is too big to use in conjuntion with the headrest. It is, however, perfect for your baby after he/she has outgrown the headrest because the wings are so puffy that when pushed all the way back on the side of the neck it will act as a head support if your baby falls asleep but is too big for a normal head rest. This product is good at keeping the straps from rubbing baby's neck. It is also SUPER soft! Is is chenille and very cozy for baby's skin."
2,Too heavy and loud for my taste,"Too heavy and loud for my taste. It heats up quite quickly. I ended up buying and keeping the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper with Adjustable Blade, which is much more light weight and quiet. Although both cut well, the Oster Pro hardly heats up at all. Good luck finding the right clipper for you."
5,3 Horrors for the Price of 1 !!!,"How can you beat that? Three great horror flicks for the price of one? All well made films and all well worth the watch to those who have not seen them yet. You can't go wrong with this deal. If I am wrong about that, well then, you'll just have to KILL me!!!"
5,For all fans of surfer/biker/hotrod rock!,"If you love Dick Dale or Link Wray, Davie Allan is right up there with them (and I wouldn't say that lightly!) Just like those two guys he goes way back and he's the Real Deal. Get it for your next road trip!"
5,Edlund can opener,"This Edlund can opener is used 5 days a week at a soup kitchen that I volunteer at, we open 30 - 40 cans a day and it had held up just great, we all love it."
5,"the latest, the best","i've got to admit that this was the first choice of software i made on my first trip to Japan, deep in the heart of the Akihabara, i saw this cd in a music store and bought it before i bought a cd player. it was only later i found the track ""Biba Nova"" was on the import version of the already difficult to obtain ""The North Star"", a great track on its own,it seems to be the watermark of this great album . The acoustic and Gretsch guitars seem to take center stage along with Roddy's deeper vocal register, providing several true highlights including of course ""The North Star"" with the ""I'm from Mars and you're from Venus"" catch, to the sweet vocal / acoustic rumblings of ""Autumn Flower"" this is the disc to buy if you want to see what Roddy Frame / Aztec Camera's music is all about and then buy the last one, and then the one before that......"
3,Avengers + X-Men=Average Story,"This trade paperback takes place recently after the events in FATAL ATTRACTIONS. Magneto is braindead and The X-Men and the Avengers rush to Genoshia where other mutants take the ""dream"" of Magneto and twist and turn it into a terrorist type plan.The story is average and not a lot of the popular Avengers or X-Men are in attendance (Missing in action is Iron Man, Thor, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Colossus ).The art is somewhat good. The best art coming from Mr. Kubert. If your bored or if this is on a 50% discount rack, is the only time its worth to pick up."
2,The Avengers sections have unforgivable art,"The story was great, but the art in the sections that were from Avengers books reminded me why I didn't buy those books at that time. Compared to the art in the X-men books at that time, the Avengers books had amateurish (at best) art. The contrast from section to section is disruptive. The transition from marginal art to excellent makes me wish I hadn't spent the money on this. Find a different graphic novel, something that doesn't involve the pathetic art that the Avengers books were saddled with during this period."
3,Superheroes for the times,"The greatest superheroes of all times are those that people like. The Avengers and the X-men are the two most popular superhero groups of all times. and allthough the art is styleless, the characters are timeless."
3,A dud from Telarc,"I bought this performance of Beethoven's 9th by a no name conductor conducting a non name orchestra at a no name hall -- *only* because it was in the SACD format from the legendary TELARC. I have telarc's 1812 overture among others in SACD , and boy, it dazzles in the brilliance of it's recording! I put a lot more importance in the quality of recording than in the actual performance; yes performances vary a lot , but it won't affect your enjoyment of music as much as the quality of recording. This one is a dud. The strings are all muddy and the highs are practically non existent, though the drums ok. It sounds more like a CD from the 80s than a state of the art SACD. On the whole I am seriously underwhelmed by this recording and regret buying it. If you have a DVD Audio player, try Barenboim's version of the 9 symphonies. They are hard to find and for good reason -- each one is an absolute gem."
2,Crap,"Mine broke after 3 years. The face came loose. It killed the battery often right before it died permanently. Complete garbage. I took it apart, the battery is fine, the mechanism is broken. I saw it in a store going out of business(@union square) selling it for $20. I could buy a replacement mechanism for $13. Not worth it.The screws were near impossible to undo, I broke a few trying to adjust the band. Buy a watch kit if you buy this garbage.For $60 this is a lexus; it looks well built but it will never be a benz."
1,sadly not her best,"i loved notorious c.h.o. and im the one that i want (ive yet to listen to drunk with power), but revolution, in comparision with cho's former stand up routines, leaves much to be desired. i felt that the cd was rushed and that margaret jumped from topic to topic, suddenly switching gears. i didnt like that. i found it annoying. what i also didnt like was how she kept repeating the whole ""p*ssy write letter"" thing throughout the cd. it got tedious. also, this cd lacked margaret's hilarious imitations of her mom. all in all this cd fell short of my expectations. it gave me a few laughs but nothing close to the gut splitting action from her former cds."
2,"Sadly, she's coasting. Funny-ish.","I love Margaret Cho, full stop. I go to her shows when she is in LA, I buy her videos, and I root for her in general. I was excited to listen to this CD, but I was hugely disappointed. No gut-busting laughs, the odd funny moment, and a strange profusion of ghetto-talk, like she was Jamie Kennedy or something. Plus, you can't SEE her, so half the CD is pointless. The audience is having a great time, but you definitely aren't. (And I think it's because they are drunk.) Most excruciating is an extended discussion of her going to the bathroom in her pants, thanks to a persimmon diet. Unbelievably tedious, not to mention foul (and I love bathroom humor). I recommend RENTING the eventual DVD. Run from this CD."
2,One time listen,"I didn't think this one was as inspiring or funny as her last two. I would have liked this album a lot more if I could SEE Margaret perfoming. Since I could not, I missed half the jokes. ""Revolution"" was missing something, and half the CD seemed to be just the audience laughing. And that's fine, but since I could not see what they were laughing at and take part, it didn't make for an interesting listen."
2,Terrible,This Margaret Cho stand-up act falls far behind her other two tours. I would not recommend this C.D to anybody. It's terrible. I never had a gut-busting laugh. Not a single one.
4,Wonderful ethereal jazzy...,"This is a wonderful album, far more melodic than their first. One song even uses major chords, which is a first for this generally slow, lilting, sensual band. While I'll always be in love with the first, this one is moving in there quickly. Great lyrical rhythms and such....There is one terribly sore spot on the album, though: Fright Night. The lyrics would seem as if they were written by someone's 8 year old niece. Aside from this, which I suggest skipping before you even hear it, so as not to lower your opinion of this wonderful band, the whole thing is very powerful and emotive. (Every band has at least ONE unbearable song, no matter how excellent they are. Have some fun... make a list.)"
3,Moody and dark - doesn't rock like Bleed Your Cedar,"Hard to find this band on the west coast. Bleed Your Cedar is a great album with some tracks that ebb and flow all around you. The singer's voice and clever lyrics work well with the mix of the tempos and mood of the music. With Queen of the Meadow, there are some great tracks in here, but the singer is taken to the front of the mix and it sounds somewhat off balance too me."
1,Very disappointing.,"While I didn't expect them to live up to the standard they set for themselves with ""Bleed Your Cedar"", this CD is simply awful. I hate to say anything negative about this VERY talented band, but this is the worst CD I've purchased in many years. After having heard it one time, I nearly chucked it out the window of my car onto the highway. The only thing that prevented me from doing that was the law against littering, and this certainly qualified as trash. But, hey, if you like really slow boring songs that sound like they were written 50 years ago, and so tuneless that not even Jennifer Charles' magnificent voice could bring them to life for more than a tenth of a second at a time, then..."
5,Great First Step,"I reveled in the fact that a book has been written for those who are new to the security field. This book just be required reading for all Junior Engineers. The author does not over simplify, but does not muddy the waters for those that grasping for a clue. Kudos and Huzzah to Mr. Thomas!!!"
2,So many mistakes....,"This is the first time I've felt the need to review a book. I'm an MCSE, which means nothing other than I've read a bunch of technical books over the years. This is perhaps the worst I've read so far. The typos alone are driving me crazy, but then I also have to sift through and try and figure out what stuff is actually accurate. For example, the author writes on page 149: ""A much simpler way of looking at this is that SSH does trust any device other that the one with which it is trying to establish a secure connection."" Actually, I think that should be ""does not trust."" Small stuff like that make me wonder if anyone actually proof-read this book before it was released. This is one I'll be returning."
2,"Great sound, Bad Battery",This unit has a great sound and a cool design but my battery died after a year - it no longer holds ANY charge and you can't replace it. I suggest using the boomtube that takes AA batteries. My unit now only works if it is plugged in - kinda defeats the purpose.
1,no support or parts avialable,"This is a great amplifier and works well, unfortunately no one supports this product anymore. My battery no longer holds a charge and I can not find a replacement part or anyone that will help me."
1,the mindlessness of logic,"About six months ago I read a postion paper posted on a US Army War College site avocating the reasons why we must maintain nuclear weapons indefinitely. The reasoning & logic expressed perfectly mirrored Jonathan Schell's. I taught a college level course on nuclear war, and I can assure you Schell's logic like his counterpart only confuses the ignorant masses while smugly re-assurring those with a vested interest in maintaining nuclear weapons of the stupidty and naivete' of the opposite number. Thus, the blind lead willfully the ignorant to a future madness not yet envisaged. __JPC__"
5,One of TV's all-time best,"Just flat out fantastic. ""Law and Order"" with everything that L&O and it's spin-offs lacks. Like interesting characters. Non procedural. ""Homicide-Life on The Street"" lasted SEVEN seasons. For a show ahead of it's time, it got it's due for good reason."
5,It only gets better...,"I can't imagine anyone watching the first three seasons of this show and needing a review to urge them onward, but in case you do I'll be brief. This is a show that has stopped worrying about whether or not they're going to get cancelled next week. The ratings haven't been exceptional, but they have been exceptionally consistent, and the producers have put the pedal down to see what this puppy can do. Man, is it fun to watch. This is a network TV production at its finest and most creative. Homicide showed studio and network executives that there was money to made off edgy shows. Without visionary producers Fontana and Levinson, we might never have had The Shield, Rescue Me and a dozen other high-quality, small audience cable dramas. So put it in your cart already and savor a piece of TV history."
5,Mighty Satanic Overkill!!,"This dvd is for the blackest of blood,and will undoubtedly overwhelm you with raw power and sheer annihilating precision...Marduk once again devour all scepticism and fiercly hold there throne of wicked triumph...This brilliantly evil dvd is loaded with hours of live performance,interviews,and a eery stroll through a dark cemetery...I'd definetely recommend this to any true black metal/ Marduk fan...this dvd far exceeded my expectations...Hails!!!"
4,Wow! What a price!,"Cheaper to buy on Amazon.com and have shipped directly to house than to buy at a discount store! Goodnites are the only thing that fits my soon to be five year old daughter who has Down Syndrome. Cheaper than ""hospital"" type incontinence wear - which is ugly to boot! These work well, even in the daytime."
5,Warm and Comfortable,"I'm 5' 10"" and typically have a hard time finding the right size shirt. I wear what I would consider a Marge. I need a large medium or a small large. My wife bought this hoodie for me and bought it in a size medium. It is a great fit. My suggestion would be that if you can't decide what size to get, buy the smaller one. The hoodie is very warm, and is very similar to Under Armour's Cold Gear tights. The exterior is rather slick while the inside has the fleece lining. The wind will cut through the material, so don't expect it to keep you roasty toasty on a windy COLD day with nothing but a t-shirt under it. However, it is very comfortable, great fit, and will keep you warm. This is a great product."
4,Nice sweatshirt,"The sweatshirt is comfortable, warm and looks great, however the medium is really a large. I always wear medium in my shirts and sweatshirts and this one is just too big."
4,Pretty Darn Good,"It's true, Under Armour is good stuff. Whether or not any hot brand is actually worth the price of it's name is debatable (doubtful), but you can't argue that Under Armour gear isn't top-shelf quality.This hoodie is top quality, comfy, warm, and has that cool sheeny surface. My only gripe is that the collar and sleeves are rigid (well not rigid, but not expandable) and kinda tight. It's not so important for the neck hole, and in fact it might be a good thing 'cause it doesn't stretch out. But the sleeves--you simply can't roll 'em up, which I like to do. Maybe you can if you have malnourished forearms, but even then I doubt it.Anyway, top-of-the-line performance hoodie, but you can't roll up the sleeves."
4,Great Gift,"Purchased this Armour Fleece Hoody for my son's birthday (from his Amazon Wish List). He was delighted, it fit him perfectly. Thanks Amazon for making gift shopping for my family so easy and sure to please them all."
3,bottom too loose,"It is a quality fleece but the bottom was too loose for my taste. I am 6'2"" 160 so i needed a large for length but the waist was to large and unlike a normal hooded sweatshirt the bottom was not very elastic."
5,Really nice hoodie -- worth the $$s for sure,"I bought these for both of my teenage boys and my husband (in black and white) and they are very-well loved and worn. They hold up great through washing and are warm without being bulky. They run a bit large though. One son who usually wears a large needed to downsize to a medium (he's 5'10"" and about 145lbs). He was swimming in the Large and the Medium was roomy and just right."
4,Light and Comfortable,"Perfect item to wear on those cold , snowy Syracuse days. Hoodie is not bulky or heavy and works well by itself or under something."
2,A complete pain,"There is absolutely nothing easy about this plug. The hole in the outer shell and the inner plug assembly are both so small that you have to shave away most of the wire's insulation in order for it to fit. If you're lucky, and you don't expose any bare wire, then you still have to fight to get the wire in and then, now that it's stuffed with wire, you have to somehow squeeze everything back together. Sound like fun? It's not, trust me. This thing is sooo not worth the aggravation.-Doug"
4,Excellent for those who have had a True Girlfriend!,This book brought tears to my eyes as I recalled my personal experieces with my best friends. I could truly relate to most of the feelings expressed. It had wonderful pictures. I could recomment this to anyone who has had a true best friend. Girls most certainly need at least one good friend to survive in this world.
2,This is a discontinued unit,"I used this product on a Dell Mini 9 Netbook for less than a week. While having it plugged into 12 volt DC power from a vehicle for only the third time, I heard a pop and smoke came out of the unit. Calling Xantrex for support they said that my netbook drew too much power. Using a Kill-a-Watt it draws 56 Watts. The Mini 9 power brick says AC Inputer 1 amp. Xantrex support says this is too much and that an internal fuse might have blown. The unit was purchased in late February 2009, but the manufactured date is November 22, 2006. Xantrex does not sell this unit under the Xantrex name anymore. Only under the Duracell name. After some discussion, Xantrex agreed to replace the unit because of the old manufactured date. If this unit does not power a netbook, I find it hard to believe that it can power any laptop. The website says ""The mighty battery provides up to 2 additional hours of runtime for a laptop"" and shows a full size laptop and an USB device plugged in."
4,Camping?,I'm going camping (sans electricity) for a week but need to keep my Blackberry going . . . My initial testing of this product is pretty good. It does well with Cell phones. I think if I just used it for my Blackberry I might be able to keep it going all week. I tried it on my Archos and that seems to wear it down much more quickly. A full charge powered my 13 watt flourescent for 2 hours before it died.
2,charging issues,"the Xantrex unit would not take a charge with the ac adaptor when it was new out of the box, and now it will not take a charge from the DC converter. That makes the unit worthless. A waste of my money"
5,Great portable power pack,"I was searching for a replacement power source after my Black & Decker had recently failed. This is perfect and even better than the prior. Lithium Ion which is better and last longer, holds a charge longer, and even charges faster.At first I was skeptical but once I tried it out, I loved it. I use it to recharge my USB devices such as my phone or my mp3 player or my laptop in case I need a charge while Im on the road.Ive used this to recharge my camera, mp3 player, cell phone, and even my bluetooth headset."
3,Bliss Remiss,"I purchased this product with a two-fold purpose. 1) to maintain a full charge on my Blackberry and to provide for emergency power for my notebook. I have a FIVE PLUS star rating for the former and a ""0"" star for the later. When I found myself in a situation where I had to have another hours juice for my notebook, I couldn't even get a second. So, I'm not thrilled, but it'll do."
4,functional,"Good switch for if you want on/off access near an outlet and not the appliance. 2 prong only though, so limited kinds of appliances it can take."
5,switch,Not much to rate. It works. Simple on & off. Polarized if you need that feature. Seems to be well made.
4,Not a bad little printer for the price,"I got this printer free with my Snow iMac 600 mhz. The printer is ""cute"", but a little too noisy for my tastes. My daughter has the Epson 8 cubed printer & it is so quiet & nice....much quieter than this one.The output is great (even photo-quality using glossy paper), especially compared to the HP 694C that it replaced. I do seem to run out of black ink rather quickly, but have not tried the Rhinotek ink cartridges yet.I think the cons are: noise level & the fact that the driver software won't ""remember"" my page setup options for saved documents (as in, I have to re-set everything each time I print). The price & the quality of the output make up for these drawbacks."
2,Paper feed mechanism is terrible,"I bought this Epson because of the picture quality and reliability. This printer is pretty good in printing photo quality pictures. However, my major gripe was that the paper feeding mechanism is really bad. It constantly jams and I have to feed new sheet in all the time. The reason this is occuring is because epson changed their loading mechanism that was on their model 740, to one in which the paper is not as straight when it's at rest. Then, when the paper needs to be fed, a lot more problems occur, and creates a big hassle. I will probably still get an Epson for my next printer, but I will not get the same type of paper feed EVER!"
3,"Pass on this one -- too noisy and too slow, Ink expensive!","I bought this somewhat seduced by its imac look. My research pointed me to the Epson inkjet printers for the lowest ink streetprices. The cold reality -- this 777i makes all kinds of noises if it doesn't like the state of your paper and then some. Its louder, crankier and pokier than the Lexmarks and HPs that I've had in the past. Now that I've bought this particular model I am finding its black ink runs out fast and even generic ink prices are higher than than they are for other Epson inkjet printer models. The lesson here is about printer needs: those consumers requiring good black and white printing will find this printer too high-end, requiring frequent and expensive ink refills (try the color 480sxu) and for those who seek high quality art/photowork and are willing to put out money and time for ink there are better Epson models to be had. Pass this one up."
5,Always been an Epson fan..,"This is my 4th Epson printer and as usual, I am very happy. The installation was the easiest I've ever seen. I bought this one because of the price and the print quality..my Epson Stylus 740 seemed to be out of style. :) ( But STILL working with no problems ) I have been very happy with not only the black and white photos I've printed but the color as well. For the price..jump on it!"
2,Rethink purchasing this printer,"I've been using my epson 777i for nearly 6 months with my iBook. I'm pretty unhappy that the printer will not print without both cartridges being well stocked. I cannot switch to only black ink printing if my color cartridge is out. Cartridges are unable to be refilled, alternate cartridges cause problems with the program, and I am not able to print out nearly the amount of pages as advertised, even when using economy mode. The printer quality is good, but The cartridges run out so fast and are quite expensive when you have to replace them twice as much. I'm already thinking of replacing it and getting rid of it. There is no way to know when your ink is dangerously low, and it will not print if the ink is getting near low, which means you cannot run the cartridges to the last drop...a feature I appreciated in my last printer. SUMMARY: There are better printers out there that have lower maintenace costs. Shop around."
3,"Nice print quality, but unfortunate ink cartridges.","Like most of Epson's printers, the 777i offers outstanding photo print quality, even on regular paper. Unfortunately, the small, overly proprietary cartridges used by the 777i make it less than ideal for someone who plans to do quite a bit of printing. Ink costs escalate rapidly, so I would suggest looking into a printer with larger ink cartridges that are offered at a good price by Epson or alternative ink vendors. Always check the ink situation before you buy an inkjet printer."
5,excellent music book for beginner,"As a beginner, I found this book with CD excellent. Easy to use and learn from. Highly recommended."
5,Programming Micrososft Visual C# 2005,"This book should be in every programmer's library, especially those who know C/C++ and want to become knowledgeable with C# and .NET. It is full of useful topics and valuable, detailed examples to support learning. I found the debugging topics a nice bonus. Mr. Marshall is definitely an expert in C# and .NET technology."
2,Annoying,"After 60 pages, I switched to ""C# Programming Guide"" from Visual Studio Documentation - in my opinion the same contents, but better written, and navigation is easier. Bottom line: waste of money."
3,A bit too dry,"This book is too dry. Although it is packed with lots of information, you have to already be an expert programmer to fully understand all the topics. It does not explain things in a friendly manner. If you're a professional programmer then you might find this book very helpful, but the casual hobbyist or the beginner may find this book a bit confusing."
1,Badly Written,"I have just finished the process to return this book to Amazon and I am grateful that they will let me return it ... This book is so badly written that it is unreadable. Obviously, the book was not properly edited. The material in the book is probably useful, but the terse writing style and unintelligible sentence structure makes it a pain to suffer through. I'm going to seartch for something better."
3,Someone bent the truth,"I got this because I am taking the MCTS exam soon, and microsoft recomended this as the book to get. It didn't prepare me for the exam. It is just what it describes itself as, a reference to the C# language, NOT the .net framework. It will only give an overview of the rest of what makes C# a good language.It isn't a bad book, but it is not designed to teach or really expand your knowledge, just something for you to not have to flip through the miles of unrelated info in the MSDN library trying to figure out how to form a statement. A good book of you already have a really good grasp on the language, otherwise...."
2,Solid Coverage of the Topic,"As an MCAD, I think this book provides excellent coverage of C#, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reference for the language.I think some reviews on this book were looking for more of an introductory step-by-step sample format, which this is not. This is most appropriate for those with some programming background, who want to add C# to their list of languages."
2,Language guide...NOT a programming reference,"The title of this book ""The Language"" is very appropriate: it offers a very in-depth description of the C# 2.0 language and also covers related topics such as MSIL, Visual Studio 2005 (overview only) and its debugger.The book is very extensive and every topic (read: language element) is described in extreme detail. Unfortunately this is done using very abstract terms and the entire book looks like a list of syntax definitions. This makes it very tiring to read and the massive number of senseless lines (""Instance members are inexorably linked to an instance and are accessible from the point of instantiation."") and grammar errors compund this.If you are looking for a very comprehensive language syntax description, I highly recommend this book. If you are looking for a reference guide to help you program...look further."
3,Good information but hard to read,"This book covers quite a bit of material, including all of the new features in C# 2005. I found it very helpful, except that the language is unnecessarily convoluted in many places. ""An interface is a contract and defines the requisite behavior of generalization of types."". ""Metadata, which is often described as data about data, formalizes the composition of an assembly."" Huh? This stuff is hard enough without language like that. ""Eschew obfuscation"" as the bumper sticker says."
4,Good info,The beginning stuff was informational but not to helpful....but the stuff in the second half...now that is what I am looking for!!!
5,Hysterical!,This is hysterical! Watch it over and over and over again! Would definitely recommend this to my friends for sure.
1,.,"If not for the supplemental materials my professor created, this book would be useless. Poorly written to give understanding to anyone who didn't already know the material."
4,Decent Inexpensive knives,"These are pretty good knives for the price. I have a set of Wustoff Grand Prix at home, these are no where near as nice, but they get the job done. the knives are a little light, so they are not as confidence inspiring as the Wustoff, but this set costs a fraction of the price of a Wustoff chef's knife, so they are a good value. If you have never owned a set of good knives, you will be extremely happy with these...heck, for the price, you may be happy no matter what. 3 stars on the knives, 5 stars on the value."
4,"Please, people!","What is wrong with the beginning of the queen's death? The death affects the rest of the story, and though I admit that it was a little sad to see, how do you compare this to all the Disney movies? Cinderella's parents die, as do Snow White's, and all the rest of the princesses. Besides, the mother always seems to die, so why does it matter? It raises questions in which you can talk to your kids about death and comfort them."
2,Over rated. ugh,I don't know why this book gets such rave reviews. It's not really suitable for small children as the book mentions whipping horses and all of the men in the book are jerks. Her father and her brothers are all mean to her and the dialogue is really forced. I was hoping for a feminist fair tale and it was a total bust.
5,My Daughter's Favorite Over Time,"Have to share a proud daddy moment regarding this thoroughly enjoyable book. Yesterday, as we were passing the time during her younger brother's nap, I asked my daughter to read a book to me. She has a wide variety on a full shelf (including every Disney princess) and she brought this book that I have been reading to her since she was four. For the first time, I really had an opportunity to trade places with her and enjoy the art. The details in the illustrations alone give this book as permanent a place on the shelf as there can be. I also loved the pride my daughter took in Violetta's hard-earned accomplishments. Lastly, as one of the ""nice"" guys, I love the fact that she ends up living happily ever after with the humble gardener's son . I highly recommend the book."
4,The itsy-bitsy princess!,"I actually ended up quite enjoying this book!I'm always a little hesitant that 'strong female character books' will end up being, not so much that, as 'lazy-stupid-classless male books.'Thankfully (even though there was indeed some of that in this book) I felt our princess held her own and made herself a protagonist from her own hard work and dedication.Yes, I would have liked for there to be at least one prince or knight that wasn't so stereotypical, but other than that I didn't really have too many qualms with the story.I liked that the princess uses her ""weaknesses"" to her advantage and that she hones her one skills and makes her own choices.Recommended!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for my 4 yr old niece, unfortunatly after reading the book I decided it was not appropriate for her. Yes the queen dies... And the brothers are not very nice... But there is a page where the nursemaid is soothing the little girl who has a large bruise on her back from fighting with her brothers. And there is no lesson that says that this behavior is wrong. The little girl is determined and the independence she shows seems to be from a sink or swim kind of attitude.I had my mother in law read the book to make sure that I was just not being overly sensitive, and she agreed that this was not the best choice for my niece. There are so many good childern's books for 4 yr olds... I just don't this is one of them."
3,She still isn't complete without a man.,"Liked the message of keep trying. Liked the independence and the nice brother.But no matter what this girl achieved,the story wasn't considered over until she was married.Please read Rumpelstiltskin's Daughter instead."
2,The Princess Knight book review,"This book is just okay. The knight is not even mentioned in the story. And there ain't no princess either. Now come on, who writes a book with no princess or a knight if it is in the title? I believe that what is in the title should be included in the story. Maybe I am wrong. When I read Dr. Seuss books, if the book was The Cat and the Hat, there was a cat and a hat mentioned in the story. This story is just ""different."" Most of the books that I have read, mention the words that appear in the title. The books that don't, I usually don't enjoy. If you want to read a book like this, go ahead. I still enjoyed this book. But, nothing can compare to some of Cornelia Funke's other books, such as the Theif Lord."
4,Texas Honkytonk Done Right,Roger Creager has that down-home-Austin-foot-stompin' music you just can't help but enjoy! Looking forward to hearing his music in the future.
2,Superficial,"I've read many, even most of the books on Korean culture. This book could have been useful and interesting, but instead I found it to be superficial. Sure, some of the photos are good, but many terms are not defined. If you know a lot about Korean culture, you'll find it frustratingly sparse, if you know little you'll find it frustratingly full of words you're not familiar with that aren't adequately explained."
4,Good selections,"Much of this is from a rare (and unauthorized) recording of Dr.King speaking at Zion AME Church in Los Angeles in 1962 (not 1966 as stated on the cover). Pretty good stuff. ""My Little Girl"" is a moving soliloquy on the evils of segregation as it affected his young daughter (good way to explain the concept of segregation to young children). ""We Must Work"" and ""We Shall Overcome"" are good audience motivators and will inspire people upon listening to them."
3,"Fine book, just not what i wanted","I was looking for a guide to older classical LPs, so this wasn't really what I was looking for."
3,I don't know how good the book is.,"This book was sent out a month ago. I never received it and it could not be located, as the company who sent it out (Stevensbooks) has no tracking. However, they stated they may start this service after my experience. The company kindly submitted a full refund."
1,Not What It's Cut-Out to Be,"Although this guide is recommended by a few 78 RPM record collectors on the internet, I found it full of omissions. Older recordings in my our collection, even though their historical value may be significant to some, are not listed at all. It seems that some of these performers are unknown by the author. Look up John McCormack with your search engine, for instance. Many fans of the records by this famous Irish tenor, particularly in Ireland, would be appalled. The label examples are fun, but are not worth the full new price of the book. Buy it used from Amazon if you want to check it out. Otherwise leave your searches on the internet for other books more beneficial to your collection. For later recordings, or those of the '50s, check out 'Rockin' Records'."
1,I wish I could give it no stars,"Terribly organized, horribly incomplete and wrong about values. This is just an awful book. Checking on Ebay is a million times better. Thank heavens I sold mine."
1,Not what I thought it was.,Info was not what I was looking for. I wanted more info on every day 78 records. I didn't expect mostly high end products.
5,Definate must have,"This album is probably one of the best albums printed,it the guitar is amazing and the singing is unbelievable the drums are great. Awesome Band!They are a great addition to my collectiononly the people with good taste in music would buy this cd.So Buy it. I totaly suggest it...Its really amazing..."
2,Printing issues,"Textprinted is light ink and seems to be stretched to one side of the page. This is a difficult subject to put in a book, but about as good of job as Drevers version called The Geochemistry of Natural Waters."
4,thorough textbook,leading text in aqueous geochemistry is thorough and well founded. A very good reference.
4,WOW!,"I stumbled upon some of Ms. Frank's material on the net and decided I needed to hear more. I have not been disappointed! Kimberly Frank has an absolutely beautiful voice. Why she hasn't pursued a singing career stateside remains a mystery to me. The standout tracks on the CD are ""1,000 Miles,"" ""I Don't Wanna Cry"" and a cover of the Beatles, ""If I Fell"" (sung as a duet with former Toto lead vocalist, Joseph Williams). With that being said, there are NO weak tracks on the CD, all of the songs are both beautifully written and beautifully sung.If you want to broaden your musical horizons a little, give this CD a listen, you won't be disappointed."
5,Works perfectly fine for me,"Literally, I dont see why people are complaining about this tv. I've never had one problem with it, and I've used mine for 6+ years including every single hook up you can attach to the TV including Wii, Xbox, older gaming systems, PS3, bluray players, even surround sound system, and hooking up a computer to show up on tv, i've used all components and HDMI connectors, and I've blasted the sound plenty of times on mine too including changing all sound settings around.I've yet to have a single problem out of it.I'm really being picky, but I am trying to find something wrong with it, and all I can say is when I turn the sound up real loud and the bass in a movie or something hits, you can hear it kinda vibrate in the speaker. Then again, this is not a radio sound system nor is the TV a 1000w amp to hold all sorts of power."
1,TV went black after less than a year,"The sad thing about this TV set is that I really took the time to get the right LCD TV set and sadly after a year and a half the thing went black and I can't get it to come back on for any period of the length.Just not worth the investment and this leaves me with such a poor sour feeling towards all LG products, I'd stay away from the LG brand name forever."
4,SHOCKING REVELATIONS,"If Singular is correct in his assertions, this book is a wakeup call for those who do not believe the police can be corrupt, and goto great lengths to tamper with and cover up evidence. We can thank Singular's secret informant who ratted out the LAPD and LADA to preserve some integrity in the justice system. For people who believe this book to be a work of fiction, they should be prepared to explain how the privileged insider information turned out to be true. It is puzzling why few people have given Singular the credit he is due, especially from the Dream Team. I believe Simpson to be innocent, in part because the evidence actually points to two killers, and all of the blood evidence against Simpson is tainted or suspect in some respect."
5,Best Bass Compilation I Own,I couldn't belive the tracks on this when i first got it. Night Bass has to be the greatest song. Two JL Audio 12's with a 500/1 mono amp shook my car to pieces worse than anything i've ever played when i threw this disc on. I reccommed this and anything by DJ Magic Mike.
2,Not one of her best,"This is not one of Linda's best books. I found it rather boring with too many descriptions of the ranch and too much ""thinking"" on the part of the hero and heroine. The last few chapters were good, but I was very disappointed overall."
2,Dull Epics,"EPICS is plagued by the muddled sound of TELARC's recordings. I noticed this trend beginning with TELARC's Hollywood's Greatest Hits, Vol. 2. The recoding seems flat. Also, this recording is a bit bombastic and just not representative of the original scores. The Suite from Gladiator is a good case in point. It glosses right over the basic themes presented in the film with an annoying nonce lance."
1,displeased,"I'm not a fan of this book. The explanations are long and somewhat confusing. If you spend hours and hours wading through sections you might figure stuff out, but it's no straightforward. Also, the cd that comes with the book only works with older versions of Excel (2003). I think I used this book maybe 3 times for a class I took and it didn't help at all."
1,The 2001 printing of this book is five stars all the way!,"The 2001 printing is stunning - glossy paper, beautiful photographs, and Sharyn Craig's usual excellent material.The 2009 printing is something called a ""Print on Demand"" and the quality is atrocious. It is made out of flat paper which makes the photographs dull, lacking contrast, and quite plainly AWFUL.C&T; should be ashamed to put out a product like this and Amazon should be ashamed that they sold it without notifying the consumer that it was a print on demand substandard product."
4,inspiring ideas,this book is full of inspiring ideas to help us quilters out of tough spots when working with odd blocks. I wish I had a circle of friends like her to make blocks with!
3,Setting Solutions,"This book, Setting Solutions, is part of my quilting library for future reference. It has good ideas and suggestions. Thanks."
3,I've haven't used this book yet,"I've had this book for a couple of years now and recently looked at it again. The layouts that are suggested are mostly set on-point and she has some good ideas, I suppose, but I haven't had the need to use any of the information. Hopefully I will in the future."
2,Not one of Rothrock's best,"[...]Cynthia Rothrock is very hit and miss. This movie misses the mark on many fronts.Fight scenes not as good as some of her other movies. Still, not too bad."

1,don't waste your time and money,"I ordered mats for a expedition and they sent me excursion mats twice. They are really thin, walmart brand is much more extreme. I finally got a refund after all their mix up. I tried calling Lund to fix the problem and they told me I had to go through amazon. It is hard to correct a problem through amazon because you can't call anyone and talk to them, you have to check alot of boxes that never relates to your specific problem."
5,The Singing Fire by Lilian Nattel,I loved this book! The manner in which Lilian describes the settings allows one to feel they are right there with the characters. I've read three of her great books thus far and looking forward to the next.
4,If you like quotes this is a good one,"Well worth the read for die-hard TN fans...if you love the SEC you'll like it...try out ""A Tailgater's Guide To SEC Football"" as well to learn more about the nation's toughest conference."
4,Great product good quality,"Excellent product. We were looking for baby chair and could not find any nice ones in the stores. I was bit reluctant to buy such items online. In the end we got excatly what we wanted. My daughter loves the chair. You have put this chair closer to wall or else it will slide a bit. Wish they had a lock to stop rocking when need. Overall good quality material used, great product."
3,Could be better! Too few problems!,"I used it for the cost accounting class and though I found it helpful, I thought that there were too few problems given in the study guide and the ones there did not really reflect on the ones in the textbook. The summaries were well written and an excellent tool for review, but I think the problems should correlate more with what is in the text. I did get A in the class, but I've seen better study guides. Accounting is all in practice, so problems are more important than the terminology."
3,Too Frenzied For My Blood,"Stuart Stevens had an incredible idea and has executed his story very poorly. The book starts with the promise of a spectacular gastronomic adventure and deteriorates into a frienzied, unrewarding tale. The parallel chronicle of his Mustang auto troubles is the biggest obstacle to enjoying the book. I know automobiles and Michelin traditionally go together but NOT in this case; Stevens serves up VERY lukewarm Bill Bryson-like plot points and other leftovers. The last chapter, which races at light speed to the end of the three star eating odyssey, is an example of an author (like his broken-down car) out of gas. Like the fabled Michelin inspectors, I am strongly tempted to remove a third star from this review..."
1,The Ugly American Eats Out,"I haven't been as repelled by a piece of light entertainment in years. If the writing had been any shallower, the type would have sunk into the page. Allegedly the memoirs of a wacky, food-filled trek across Europe, this roast turkey doesn't even ring true as fiction. It comes across more as a middle-aged male's mid-life-crisis fantasy. Was this serialized in Esquire by any chance? To pull off this kind of narcissistic, ""look at me, aren't I wonderful?"" sort of writing--ala Peter Mayle--requires a certain style, which this book has in negative numbers. In fact, if you add up the primary elements--pseudo-alpha male lead; attractive, eccentric female lead; overbearing dog; and a beloved car with a mind of its own--what you really have is the making of a 60's Disney Love Bug movie, ""Herbie Goes to Europe."" Except with less depth and humor."
2,Reading Frenzy,"Instead of ""Feeding Frenzy,"" I think ""Reading Frenzy"" would be a more appropriate title. I couldn't finish this book even though I avidly read every foodie-type book I can get my hands on. I think Mr. Stevens is capable of writing a very good book, but this one seems to have been written while he was on some sort of ""high"" because it's so disjointed. I read for pleasure, not to feel frenzied."
3,Hi Stuart - I KNOW you'll be reading this,"If there ever was an author sure to check the reader's comments on this site, Mr. Stevens should be the one. The original idea and some witty and downright funny comments make this an enjoyable read - the question of some of the author's minor flaws (discussed by some others already here) and most of all of some overly general generalizations (see his downright stupid comments on Belgium)hamper the enjoyment a lot."
4,Good Price Performer,"I was looking for something relatively inexpensive and functional for tire pressure monitoring. This product fit those requirements well. It provide a pressure reading easily, is housed in a case which protects it well and was inexpensive. I ordered several and one of them was defective but the merchant quickly remedied the situation by sending me a replacement which works perfectly."
2,Fragile,Accidentally dropped the gauge from a 2-foot height and the meter no longer reads correctly. Fragile. Bummed out because I only had this a week.
5,"concise, straight forward and accessible","I found this video to be very helpful. It does a good job of presenting the basic process, as well as offering many good ""tips and tricks"" along the way. The narration is light-hearted but relevant and even quite funny at times. The majority of the video is shot in close-up on the clay with the artist's hands ""in action"" as the work takes shape. I found that aspect very useful as it gave a clear demonstration of effective use of the chosen tool for a given effect. Reccommended for beginners (like me) but I'm sure there is something here for more experienced sculptors too."
4,"A little on the expensive side, but they're classics.",A classic toy set that each boy or girl will get hours of entertainment from (if you can pry them away from the video games long enough.) I had a nice set when I was young and just had to have a good set for my son.
5,one of the best war movies of all time,"1. all quiet on the western front (the original)2. patton3. platoon4. lebanon5. the thin red line6. das boot7. top guni think that the greatest war movie of all time has yet to be made, we need the structure of the thin redline, the philosophy of all quiet on the western front, the intensity and claustrophobia and outlook of lebanon and das boot and the acting of platoon and the production values of patton and top gun.perhaps some day they will all come together. in the meantime you have to admire the 4 th best war movie of all timemade at a cost probably 1/100 of top gun."
5,A Hand Relieving,"It seems after Hollywood wonders numerous not much could be shot new, capturing viewer's attention outside the Dream-Factory, in Israel for sure. But one would never ever know if one never ever watches this feature.Bloody actions of Lebanon war's first days have been presented through eyes of the inexperienced, simply young Israeli soldiers peeping via their tank eye-pipe(periscope).Whole movie is inside a tank. Depicted graphically and expertly,a tragedy is filled with barrack humor and hints, among which giving a soldier's hand relieving to having launched a rocket at this tank, a Syrian PW to pee, is in a sharp distinction to a local falangist's-an Arab Christian insurgent's (unforgettably performing actor also whole cast is really unforgettable, playing naturally) intention to cut this prisoner's little brother off after poking out his eye with spoon, sadomaizing and splitting apart with the cars on the morning.A kosher work on a military topic surely."
3,TRAPPED IN A TANK,"This film reminded me a lot of THE BEAST, the 1988 movie about a Soviet T-62 tank lost in Afghanistan during the 1981 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Even more claustrophobic, this compelling drama from first time director Samuel Moez recreates a real-life situation he claims to have experienced during the Israeli/Lebanon conflict of the early 80s. Most of the drama takes place in the severe, tight interior of the tank as four Israeli soldiers find themselves in a chaotic situation that quickly grows worse. The men grapple with not only their fear of death and fragile mortality but with their consciences and rising sense of morality -- and mortality. This is a searing film that lingers long after final fade out."
2,Not as Expected.,"I thought this would be a good pro-Israel movie like Munich, Cast a Giant Shadow, etc. It is not though. It could have been a good movie if it had a bigger budget. Why is there no footage outside the tank? There was in the ""Beast"" film."
3,its cute to look at,Brought this and it wouldnt recharge after the 2nd time around and pictures are not that clear on it either. But look wise it is just perfect for a woman who loves pink.
2,Not recommended,I would not recommend this book. It is difficult to tell if what you are reading it a story or a factual account of events. They switch back and forth from the legends to the historical facts that it is difficult to keep track. It did introduce me to many new things I didn't know about India but I will have to find a more in depth book to confirm what I learned.It read like a bunch of short book reports put together into one book.
2,It's not interestingly written!,I got it with another book about India: Traveller's history of India (fourth edition) by Sinharaja Tammita-Delgoda. Based on other reviews I thought that it will complement the Traveller's history of India with maps and pictures. But information is very limited and pictures are nothing special either. Waste of money!
5,You love to hate it!,"I used to work out all the time and thought this would be nothing. Needless to say, I haven't worked out in some time and was pleasantly surprised with this DVD.I NEVER start a video on the beginner, always going to the next step up. Well, this time I did and I'm glad I did. It uses your own weight (and concentrating on what muscle you're working helps too) and gives you such a great workout. Definitely feel the burn and soreness the next day.Why do you love to hate it?!? When you're doing the workout, you want to know exactly how much longer you'll have to push yourself and give yourself that goal. When he says ""5 more, 4 more"" - and then starts talking about something (for say 15 seconds), then comes back and says ""4 more"" (yes, we're back to 4), ""3 more, 2 more"" - then more talk - ""2 more, 1 more""...that can drive you crazy! But a good crazy. It can only do you good!Get this video, whether you're on the diet or not! It's great!"
3,Exercise CD- You on a Diet Workout,"The exercises are really good---and work well. The counting of the time on the exercises was not evenly metered, which was a little annoying. The guy demonstrating and directing the exercises also counted in reverse, which made the time seem even longer. It would have been better for him to continue describing how the excercises worked the muscles, time frame to see results, etc. to take your mind off the slow counting. There are 3 levels, but they are the same routine, just done in a more intense way."
3,Not for anybody,"The workout of course is very good. But if you haveproblems with your back, knees, and hands, like Ido, you can't really do many of the exercises.I really wanted to do this, but I can't."
4,"Good video, but...","It really bugs me when we are doing reps and then he says ok 10 more and then goes ""10, 9, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, 8,7,6,5,..."" The poor girl doing the exercises is just going through all of his talking. He can't seem to count and move at the same time. I do enjoy the workout- a lot of yoga moves but I love yoga."
3,Strictly for Beginners,"I think that the docs and this program are great for just about everyone but this workout is too simple for anyone whose tried a variety of workouts. I would reccommend this for someone who has NEVER worked out before.Also, you don't need to purchase even if Amazon offers it for 1/2 price. The book I ordered also came with a free copy and the docs tell you to copy and distribute to anyone who wants it, they just want people to get healthier and the advice in the book will do that."
4,Great for a no-equipment workout.,This is a great DVD for those with no equipment and really don't want to buy a gym membership or clutter up their home. All levels can be challenging.
3,fitness,"This video is ok. Its not very exciting, like some of the ones you see on TV. No color to the program. Not much music."
3,you on a diet,"It is a good workout, but a little too advanced for someone my age. I might be able to do the beginner level."
5,Fun read.,I really enjoyed this book. The little characters are quite comical. The diet makes a lot of sense and exercise is sensible.
